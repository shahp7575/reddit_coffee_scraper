Seven years into their marriage, Jessica Rolando discovered her husband Quentin Atlante had a six-year-old son.

She crouched behind the slides at the kindergarten, watching Quentin bend down to scoop up a little boy, playing with him cheerfully.

""Daddy, you haven't come to see me in sooooo long,"" the child complained.

Quentin ruffled the boy's hair. ""Sorry, buddy. Daddy's been swamped at work. Be good for Mommy, alright?""

Jessica froze on the spot instantly, her mind went completely blank.

Daddy? Mommy?

Quentin and child stood there together, their faces strikingly similar.

Everything screamed the brutal truth: the man who'd sworn he'd love her forever had been cheating on her all along.

They'd been childhood sweethearts, together for over a decade. Jessica had once taken a knife to the stomach saving Quentin's life, the attack leaving her not only childless but unable to ever have kids.

Back then, Quentin had knelt beside her hospital bed, eyes red with tears: ""Screw having kids—I don't want anyone else. You're everything I need, Jess!""

His trembling voice still echoed in her memory, yet the scene before her now shattered that promise into a million pieces.

Jessica stumbled backward, her heart feeling like it was being carved up by razor blades, torn into countless bleeding fragments.

She couldn't bear to watch anymore. She was terrified she'd march over there and confront Quentin, even more terrified of breaking down like some pathetic fool and being rejected.

She turned and fled.

At the kindergarten entrance, her best friend Betty Laiperze had been waiting by her SUV. Seeing Jessica's ashen face, Betty immediately jumped out. ""Jesus, Jess! What's wrong?""

""Nosh said you forgot something and went back to get it. What the hell happened?""

Nosh was Betty's son, and it was Betty who had dragged Jessica along to today's parent-teacher conference.

Jessica's face was chalk-white, tears burning behind her eyes. ""Betty, I need you to run a background check on someone.""

""Who?""

""Quentin Atlante..."" Her throat constricted as she forced out the words in a hoarse whisper. ""He has a son.""

...

【Baby, just one more week and I'll be home. Missing me yet?】

Jessica stared at Quentin's text, tears streaming down her face like a dam had burst.

Every July for the past six years, he'd disappear for two weeks on some ""business trip"" to check on their overseas branches.

Six whole years, and she'd never questioned it. Not once.

Reality had just bitch-slapped her hard, laughing at what a complete idiot she'd been.

Quentin wasn't on any damn business trip—he was playing house with his mistress and their kid!

If she hadn't stumbled onto this nightmare today, she'd probably still be living in la-la land.

Jessica kept torturing herself, flipping through the photos on her phone. Rain pounded against the windows while lightning lit up the sky, casting shadows across her ghostly pale face.

Maybe she should've seen this coming.

The Atlante family was old-school traditional—no way in hell would they let some barren woman hold the title of Mrs. Atlante.

Unless they'd orchestrated this whole thing from the start.

So what role had her so-called devoted husband been playing all along?

Jessica felt like her heart was being fed through a paper shredder. She and Quentin had been inseparable since childhood—everyone always said they were meant to be together forever.

When she was eight, she'd fallen out of their backyard oak tree. He'd thrown himself underneath her, breaking his arm, then smiled through the pain saying it was ""no big deal.""

At twelve, when she got her first period and stained her dress, even though he knew what was happening, he'd still freaked out and sobbed that he'd ""die if anything happened to her.""

At eighteen, he'd secretly entered some underground street race, nearly getting himself killed to win a ring just to propose to her.

He'd said: ""Jess, I'm gonna love you forever.""

Teenage love burns so pure and fierce—it had completely captured her heart.

Then just right before their wedding, his enemies had kidnapped her, holding her for three hellish days. When they found her, she was barely breathing.

Quentin had gotten three ribs broken trying to save her, and that's when she'd taken a knife meant for him, losing her chance to ever be a mother.

When Quentin's mother Laurel Flores found out, she'd definitely tried to break them up.

But Quentin, still covered in bruises, had knelt in the family chapel for three days on a hunger strike, declaring: ""I'd rather lose the Atlante name than lose Jess."" Finally forcing his mother to back down.

After they healed, they'd gotten married quickly. All of New York had witnessed their epic love story.

But in the end, he'd still betrayed her.

Her phone buzzed. The screen read ""Hubby""—how fucking ironic.

Jessica numbly swiped to answer. His warm voice came through: ""Hey babe, you eating real meals while I'm gone? Missing me?""

Before, she would've melted into those sweet words, desperate to tell him how much she missed him.

But now... she was terrified that if she spoke, she'd break down completely.

""Babe? Something wrong? Don't be scared—I'll catch the next flight home to be with you right now!""

Quentin's voice turned frantic—she could hear him moving around, probably grabbing his wallet and keys.

But Jessica couldn't bear to see him right now.

""I'm fine."" She was fighting to keep it together, but her voice came out rough and broken. ""Seriously, don't ditch work for me. Just fighting off a cold or something.""

This was the first time she'd ever lied to Quentin.

He didn't seem to notice, apparently distracted by something on his end, but still fussed over her: ""Alright, but get some sleep, yeah? Call me if you need anything, okay? Don't make me worry.""

Jessica managed a weak ""Mm-hmm.""

She was about to hang up when she heard a woman's sultry voice in the background: ""Quentin, Carter's finally asleep. Now we can...""

She caught the sharp intake of his breath before the line went dead.

Jessica's knuckles went white as she gripped the phone, ice spreading through her veins.

He was with that bitch right now... She couldn't let herself think about what they were doing.

A broken whimper escaped her throat—a sound completely beyond her control, like someone had reached into her chest and was crushing her heart with their bare hands.

She'd tried to convince herself maybe Quentin was just trapped in this impossible situation because of the kid.

But now it was crystal clear—he was a willing participant.

Betty must have heard her losing it because she burst through the door, then froze when she saw Jessica's hollow expression. For once, Betty—who never hesitated about anything—didn't know what to do.

""Jess, no man is worth destroying yourself over.""

Tears splashed onto the photos in Jessica's lap, each drop echoing in the silence.

Betty's heart shattered. She pulled Jessica into her arms, voice shaking with rage: ""That son of a bitch! Quentin is such a piece of shit!""

""All those pretty promises when he proposed to you, and now he's got the balls to keep a side chick and bastard behind your back.""

Jessica closed her eyes, letting the tears fall freely. She'd already made her decision about what came next...

Chapter 2

The next morning dawned bright and clear after the storm.

Jessica hadn't slept a damn minute.

She'd spent the entire night thinking—she'd experienced love in its purest form, so how could she settle for this fake bullshit?

She was Jessica Rolando who loved Quentin with everything she had, but she was also Jessica Rolando, daughter of the Rolando family. And she didn't play second fiddle to anyone.

Mind made up, she called her father Dexter: ""Dad, remember how you wanted to expand into the UK market? Betty's husband has ties to British royalty, and she's taking Nosh back there in two weeks. I want to go with them and scope things out.""

Dexter sounded confused: ""Quentin put you up to this?""

""Nope, this is my call."" Jessica let out a bitter laugh. Everyone automatically assumed she and Quentin were joined at the hip—even her own father.

Dexter was clearly surprised. His daughter had never wanted to be away from that Atlante boy for more than a day, so why the sudden interest in traveling halfway around the world?

""Jessie, did that bastard do something to hurt you?"" Dexter's voice turned deadly serious.

Jessica pressed her lips together, then decided to keep things vague for now: ""Dad, don't ask questions yet. I'll tell you everything once I'm in London.""

The Rolandos and Atlantes had been business partners for decades, and the marriage had tangled things up even more. She didn't want her family caught in the crossfire.

Her father finally gave in: ""Alright, but come by the office today. You'll need to get up to speed on the European operations.""

Jessica nodded and hung up. She dragged herself to the bathroom, wincing at her reflection—her eyes were swollen like she'd gone ten rounds with a boxer.

The divorce papers were already sitting on her nightstand, delivered by her lawyer that morning. But she still had no clue how to bring this up to Quentin. Seven years didn't just disappear overnight.

She caked on concealer to hide the evidence of her breakdown, threw on a sharp business suit and headed downstairs.

Betty was in the kitchen with Nosh, probably trying to act normal after yesterday's shitshow.

""Aunt Jess is awake!"" Nosh came running over on his little legs, grabbing her hand and blowing on it gently. ""Mommy said your heart was hurting yesterday. My magic breath will make it better!""

Six-year-olds were so damn innocent. Jessica ruffled his hair. ""You're such a sweet boy, Nosh. Aunt Jess feels much better now. Go finish your breakfast with Mommy.""

Nosh nodded seriously and scampered back to Betty.

Jessica's mind drifted to yesterday—Quentin laughing and playing with that little boy.

If their baby had survived, he'd probably be older than Carter by now.

Jessica took a shaky breath, shoving down the pain threatening to surface again. She grabbed her purse and headed out the door.

But the second she stepped out of Betty's townhouse, she spotted a figure leaning against a black Mercedes in the distance.

Quentin looked exhausted, a cigarette dangling from his lips, smoke curling around him like a shield.

Jessica froze. According to Betty's intel, both Carrie Versta and her son had July birthdays. Carrie's had already passed, but Carter's was still coming up—so why the hell was Quentin back early?

Her stare must've been intense because he suddenly looked up. And the moment their eyes met, his dull eyes completely lit up.

He strode over and pulled her into his arms.

His embrace was still warm, but now it felt like it was burning her alive.

""How's that cold? You sounded awful on the phone, so I caught a red-eye back.""

""Got to the house and you weren't there—figured you'd be at Betty's.""

Quentin's voice was thick with concern, and he looked genuinely worried.

Jessica still couldn't wrap her head around it—how could the man who claimed to love her more than life itself be playing house with another woman and their kid?

Her lips trembled as she swallowed the bile rising in her throat. She wanted to scream at him, demand answers, but instead she managed: ""I'm fine now. Was just heading home.""

Quentin's shoulders sagged with relief: ""Next time you're sick, call me immediately, okay? I was losing my mind worrying about you.""

His voice was so gentle, so caring—for a split second, she almost believed they were still that perfect couple.

But then she caught sight of a slim figure hovering near the street corner.

Carrie stood under a tree with phone pressed to her ear, saying something. A second later, Quentin's phone started buzzing.

He glanced at the screen and his face shifted: ""Shit, emergency at the office. I gotta handle this.""

Jessica's breath caught. She wasn't blind—she'd seen that name flash across his screen. Carrie Versta.

The bitterness was about to choke her, but she forced herself to say: ""Of course, go handle your business. Work comes first.""

Quentin looked genuinely guilty as he kissed her forehead before jumping in his car and speeding off.

The moment Quentin drove away, Carrie ended her call and sauntered over with a predatory smile: ""Hello there, you must be Jessica. I'm Carrie Versta, I'm...""

She trailed off meaningfully, taking in Jessica's tight expression and realizing something.

""Oh, looks like Miss. Rolando already know about me and Carter. Well then, just sit back and enjoy the show.""

Chapter 3

Jessica hailed a cab and tailed Carrie to the hospital.

Standing outside the room, she watched everything unfold, feeling like a knife was twisting in her chest.

She bit down hard on her lip to keep from making a sound.

Quentin's son was hooked up to an IV, his little face pale and exhausted—he looked so fragile.

Quentin was completely freaking out, pacing the room and absolutely losing his shit:

""Are you kidding me right now? Can't even treat a kid's fever properly!""

The attending physician was Wayne Cortes—Jessica recognized him as one of Quentin's best buddies from college.

""Your kid's running a fever because he caught a cold. Maybe focus on being a better parent instead of screaming at my residents!""

""Jesus, Quentin, I don't know what's gotten into you. Didn't you say you'd pay that woman off after she had the baby? Now you're calling me over every damn cold. What happens if Jessica finds out?""

After a long pause, Quentin's voice came out tired and defeated: ""What am I supposed to do, Wayne? The kid loses his mind every time I try to send Carrie away. He won't stop crying. I can't just let him suffer like that.""

""Oh please, we both know this isn't about the kid,"" Wayne snorted. ""You're getting attached to playing house.""

That set Quentin off even more. He rubbed his temples hard: ""That's bullshit and you know it. Jessica's the only woman I've ever loved—that hasn't changed. But the Atlante family needs an heir, and you need to help me keep this from her. I can't stand the thought of hurting her.""

""As for Carrie, she gave me a son. I owe her that much.""

Right on cue, Carrie pushed through the door, tears streaming down her face: ""Oh God, Quentin, this is all my fault. I should've taken better care of Carter. He spiked a fever right after you left last night, crying for his daddy, but I didn't want to interrupt your time with your wife...""

Quentin touched the kid's burning forehead and sighed, his heart finally softened.

He pulled Carrie into his arms: ""Shh, don't cry. I'm not blaming you. Carter's our son—I'm the one who's been a shitty father.""

Carrie clutched at his shirt, her fingers trailing across his chest: ""Quentin, I know I'll never measure up to Jessica, but I just can't stand watching our boy suffer...""

Quentin's expression hardened with determination: ""Nobody's gonna dare to make my son suffer. But you need to take care of yourself too. Look at you, you're a mess.""

He reached up and gently wiped away a tear from her cheek, the intimate gesture slicing through Jessica's chest like a blade.

Jessica clenched her fists so hard her nails drew blood, leaving crescent-shaped marks on her palms. She couldn't even feel the physical pain anymore.

Nothing could compete with the agony tearing through her heart.

Rain started pouring down again as Jessica left the hospital.

She walked through the downpour, completely numb. Rain mixed with tears on her face, blurring her vision, but it couldn't wash away the devastation inside her.

By the time she reached the Rolando Group headquarters, her heels had rubbed her ankles raw and bloody.

The receptionist nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw Jessica's condition: ""Ms. Rolando! Oh my God, what happened? Should I call Mr. Atlante? He's going to be so worried when he sees you like this!""

Jessica's heart had gone completely numb. Yeah, everyone just assumed Quentin loved her—no exceptions.

But they never knew how much lies and betrayal were mixed into that so-called love.

She gently pushed away the receptionist's helping hands, her voice hoarse: ""I'm fine. Just got caught in the rain. Can you grab me some clean clothes?""

She handed over her card and locked herself in the nearest conference room.

The moment the door closed, Jessica completely fell apart. She'd thought seeing those photos had prepared her for reality.

But watching that perfect little family unit up close had ripped open her deepest wounds all over again, leaving her raw and bleeding.

Her heartbroken sobs echoed through the empty conference room.

She wanted to scream at Quentin—why was he the one making all those promises back then, and now he was the one playing happy family with someone else?

A knock at the door finally pulled her back to reality.

By the time she pulled herself together and opened the door, whoever it was had already left. Just a fresh outfit and her credit card sitting there, plus a steaming cup of coffee.

A handwritten note was tucked under the mug: ""Don't worry, Ms. Rolando. I didn't call Mr. Atlante. Figured you wouldn't want him to worry.""

A storm of emotions churned in Jessica's heart. But in the end she tore up the note and tossed it in the trash.

She grabbed the clothes and hit the bathroom to change. Within minutes, she was back to being the untouchable Rolando heiress—nothing could touch her now.

She spent the rest of the day buried in work, her heels clicking authoritatively across the executive floor.

Quentin had been texting her nonstop. She didn't even glance at her phone.

That evening, she dragged herself exhausted ass home, planning to pack and catch the first flight out of JFK in the morning.

But the moment she opened the front door, she heard a child's giggles echoing through the living room.

And there was Carrie Versta, standing right in her goddamn house like she owned the place.",1,1752221828.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

The sex was good—it always was.

But as Nathan Harrison rolled off her and reached for his cigarettes, Amelia knew something was coming.

She could feel it in the way he wouldn't look at her, in the tension radiating from his shoulders.

""We need to get divorced.""

Just like that. No buildup, no explanation. Like he was asking her to pass the salt.

Amelia was still trying to catch her breath, her skin flushed and damp. She turned toward him, confused. ""What?""

Nathan lit his cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating his sharp features before darkness settled between them again. ""She's got stomach cancer. Six months, maybe less.""

She. Always she. Never a name, like saying it out loud would make it too real.

""Dying as my wife—that's all she wants."" He took a long drag, exhaling slowly. ""It would mean everything to her.""

The bedroom went quiet except for the distant hum of traffic from the city below. Their shadows stretched across the wall from the bedside lamp, and Amelia stared at them—two people who should be close but felt like strangers.

""It's not permanent,"" Nathan continued when she didn't respond. ""Just until... you know. Then we'll get back together.""

""Amelia, she's dying.""

His voice was so calm, so reasonable. Like he was discussing weekend plans instead of asking her to give up her marriage.

Amelia studied his profile—the same face she'd been in love with since she was seventeen. God, had it really been seven years? Seven years of following him around like a lost puppy, taking whatever scraps of attention he threw her way.

She remembered the night that started it all. Rain pouring down, her stepfather's fist connecting with her ribs for the third time that week. Then Nathan appeared out of nowhere, soaking wet, gripping a broken piece of fence like a weapon.

""Back off!"" he'd shouted, stepping between them. ""You touch her again, I swear to God—""

He'd saved her that night. Seventeen-year-old Amelia had fallen so hard she never got back up.

For seven years, she'd done everything he asked. Followed him to college, changed her major to match his interests, even turned down job offers in other cities just to stay close. And every time she succeeded, every time she made him proud, he'd ruffle her hair and say, ""Good job, Mia.""

It was never enough, but she'd convinced herself it was just how he showed love. Quiet. Reserved. Even when people called her pathetic for chasing him, she didn't care. He was Nathan Harrison, and somehow, impossibly, he'd chosen her.

When his grandfather got sick last year and the family decided a wedding might bring good luck, Nathan had asked her almost casually: ""Want to make it official?"" She'd thought all those years of waiting had finally paid off.

But marriage hadn't changed anything. If anything, he seemed more distant than ever.

""Are you even listening to me?"" Nathan's voice cut through her thoughts, sharp with irritation.

""Yeah, I'm listening."" Amelia sat up, pulling the sheet around herself. ""You want to divorce me so you can marry your dying girlfriend.""

""She's not my girlfriend."" The words came out too quick, too defensive. ""Look, she's going through hell, okay? And she's never tried to break us up or anything. She could've easily made a move, but she didn't because she respects our marriage.""

Amelia almost laughed. Respects our marriage. Right.

""Every time I try to help her, she says no because she doesn't want to hurt you."" Nathan's voice took on that self-righteous tone she'd grown to hate. ""She's a good person, Mia. She doesn't deserve to die alone.""

""And what about me?"" The question slipped out before she could stop it.

Nathan's jaw tightened. For a moment, he looked almost annoyed that she'd asked. ""She's dying, Amelia.""

""I get that, but—""

""She loves me, okay?"" The admission hung in the air between them. ""And yeah, maybe I have feelings for her too. But we've never done anything about it because of you. We've never even kissed.""

Because of me. Like she was some obstacle they'd heroically overcome.

""She's kind and selfless, and she's running out of time."" Nathan's voice went cold. ""Don't make me think you're the kind of person who'd deny a dying woman her last wish.""

There it was. The trap, perfectly set. Be the good wife and step aside, or be the heartless bitch who wouldn't let a cancer patient die happy.

Amelia looked at him—really looked at him. When had he become this stranger? When had the boy who'd saved her turned into someone who could ask her to break her own heart and call it kindness?

She knew exactly when. The day Vivian Hope walked into their lives.

""You're sure about this?"" she asked quietly. ""The divorce?""

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line. He stared at the wall, not meeting her eyes. ""Yeah. Look, you—""

""Okay.""

The word stopped him mid-sentence. His head snapped toward her, eyes narrowing like he was trying to figure out her angle.

""Just like that?""

""Just like that.""

Something flickered across his face—surprise, maybe suspicion. ""You're up to something.""

""I'm not up to anything, Nathan.""

""Bullshit. You're playing some game, trying to guilt me or—""

""I said okay."" Amelia's voice was steady, almost eerily calm. ""What else do you want?""

Nathan studied her for a long moment, then stubbed out his cigarette harder than necessary. ""Fine. Whatever."" He grabbed his clothes from the floor, pulling them on with sharp, angry movements. ""I'll have my lawyer draw up the papers.""

He headed for the door without another word, like her feelings didn't matter at all. Like asking your wife to divorce you so you could marry someone else was just another Tuesday night conversation.

The door slammed behind him, leaving Amelia alone in the sudden quiet.

Her phone buzzed against the nightstand. A text from a contact she'd labeled ""Vivian's Fake Account.""

He stopped by again tonight. ?

Attached was a photo taken through a glass door—Nathan's reflection, smiling in a way Amelia had never seen. Soft. Tender. Like he was looking at something precious.

She scrolled up through months of messages:

He told me he's falling for me.

Rainy night but I'm not cold. He's keeping me warm. ☔❤️

The real mistress is the one who isn't loved, Amelia. You're just his convenient wife for the family. I'm the one in his heart.

Message after message, each one a small knife twisting deeper. Proof of every suspicion she'd tried to ignore.

She'd never seen Nathan look the way he did in these photos. Never heard his voice go soft like it apparently did when he talked to Vivian. With Amelia, he was always controlled, distant. With Vivian, he was alive.

The first message was from eight months ago: You know who this is. Did you like the flowers I sent for your living room? Nathan said they were perfect.

Vivian Hope. Instagram darling, Manhattan's go-to floral designer for the wealthy elite. Amelia had shown Nathan these messages before, but he'd dismissed them.

""Could be anyone,"" he'd said. ""Where's your proof it's actually her? You probably sent these to yourself.""

Most of the photos were generic—shots anyone could take from outside a building or across a restaurant. But tonight's was different. Clear. Undeniable.

Would it matter? Would showing him change anything?

Amelia set the phone aside and opened the bottom drawer of her nightstand. Hidden under old magazines was a manila folder containing the pregnancy test she'd taken that morning.

Positive.

She was carrying Nathan's baby, and he wanted to divorce her to marry another woman.

Her tears hit the paper, smearing the medical print. She picked up Nathan's lighter from the ashtray and held the flame to the corner of the document, watching it curl and burn.

He'd never know. This divorce would be the last favor she'd ever do for him.

Seven years. Seven years of her life spent loving someone who'd never really loved her back.

But she was done now. Done chasing, done hoping, done being grateful for scraps.

Nathan Harrison had saved her once when she was seventeen and broken. Now, at twenty-four, she was going to save herself.

Chapter 2

Nathan drummed his fingers against the steering wheel of his Maybach, parked outside the Manhattan Family Court. His phone lit up with an incoming call.

""Nathan, sweetheart!"" His grandmother's voice was bright but pointed. ""You and Amelia have been married a whole year. When am I getting some great-grandbabies?""

Nathan's face softened despite himself. ""Grandma, we're still figuring things out. No need to rush."" He shifted in his seat. ""How's Grandpa doing? Is he—""

""Oh, don't you try to change the subject on me,"" she interrupted with a laugh. ""Your grandfather's doing much better, thank the Lord, but honey, we're not spring chickens anymore. We want to see those babies before we're too old to spoil them rotten.""

""Grandma...""

Her tone turned serious. ""And Nathan? I've been hearing things around town. Gossip. You better be treating that sweet girl right, you hear me?""

Nathan went silent for a beat too long.

""Nathan James Harrison, are you listening to me?""

He rubbed his temples. ""Yeah, Grandma. I hear you loud and clear.""

After another few minutes of her gentle but persistent questioning, Nathan finally managed to end the call. He stared at the courthouse entrance, his jaw working.

He pulled up his messages, thumb hovering over Vivian's contact—the heart emoji next to her name, the photo of her laughing in golden sunlight. He scrolled past it and tapped Amelia's name instead. Their last exchange was just logistics: time, place, what to bring.

She was ten minutes late. Not like her at all.

Where are you?

A tap on his window made him look up. Amelia stood there looking washed out, dark circles under her eyes. She slid into the passenger seat without a word.

She was wearing the same clothes from yesterday—a cream blazer and black pants she'd bought for him last month. ""You look good in earth tones,"" she'd said, holding the jacket up to his chest.

For seven years, she'd dressed him, fed him, organized his entire life down to his dentist appointments.

""You're late,"" he said.

""By ten minutes."" Her voice was flat. No apology, no excuse. The old Amelia would've shown up an hour early with coffee and an explanation for every minute of delay.

Nathan's drumming stopped. He studied her profile—pale, distant, like she wasn't really there.

""My grandmother just called."" He looked straight ahead. ""We can't tell them about any of this. The divorce, I mean. It would kill them.""

Amelia didn't nod or agree like she usually did. Instead: ""What did she say?""

""Wants grandkids. The usual."" Nathan's voice tightened with irritation. ""She's been hearing rumors about us.""

The silence stretched between them. After what felt like forever, Amelia let out a short, bitter laugh.

Nathan's hands clenched. He kept his eyes on the courthouse steps, watching couples come and go.

He'd thought about kids before. Late at night, after sex, he'd sometimes trace circles on Amelia's stomach and murmur, ""Maybe we should start trying soon."" It was always someday, eventually, when things settled down.

But Vivian only had six months. After that, everything would go back to normal. There'd be plenty of time for babies then.

""Last chance to back out,"" Amelia said quietly. ""Do you really want to do this?""

""Are you kidding me right now?"" The anger in his voice was sharp, real. ""Vivian's at home waiting for an answer. Don't start playing games.""

Instead of responding, Amelia pulled out a thick manila envelope and handed it to him.

Nathan frowned as he opened it. Property division agreement. Legal letterhead, official seals, the works.

""Since we're doing this, we might as well do it right,"" she said, her tone businesslike. ""I'm only taking what's legally mine. Everything else stays with your family.""

She placed a pen on the center console. ""The cooling-off period starts once we sign. Whatever money we make during the separation belongs to each of us individually.""

Nathan scanned the document. It was thorough, professional, and surprisingly generous to him. Her signature was already there in careful script.

""What's this about?"" He looked up at her. ""It's just temporary. Six months, then we're back to normal.""

""Maybe. Maybe not.""

Something cold settled in his stomach. ""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Just sign it, Nathan.""

He studied her face, looking for the crack, the tell that would reveal her angle. Amelia always had an angle—some way to make him feel guilty or sorry for her. She'd tried it before with those fake messages she claimed were from Vivian.

But her expression was unreadable.

Fine. Let her play whatever game this is.

Nathan grabbed the pen and signed with sharp, aggressive strokes. No one manipulated him. Not anymore.

Two copies. Amelia folded hers neatly and slipped it into her purse.

The actual filing was bureaucratic and cold. Take a number, submit paperwork, fill out forms. The clerk explained the thirty-day waiting period with the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list. They each got a receipt with a return date circled in red ink.

Outside, the September sun was surprisingly warm. Nathan watched a young couple emerge from the building, both grinning, the woman showing off her ring to anyone who'd look.

He remembered Amelia doing the same thing a year ago. Practically glowing as she called her friends to share the news.

Now she stood beside him like she was waiting for a bus.

""I'll keep your account funded during the separation,"" he said, not looking at her. ""And remember what I said about my grandparents.""

He started walking toward his car, then stopped. ""Amelia.""

She looked at him, eyebrows raised.

""This is temporary. You get that, right?""

""Sure, Nathan.""

Something about the way she said it bothered him, but Vivian was waiting. He got in his car and drove away without looking back.

Amelia watched his Maybach disappear into traffic. When her Uber arrived, she climbed in and gave the driver an address on the Upper East Side.

Two cars. Two different destinations.

Nathan pulled up outside Vivian's design studio, a trendy space in SoHo with floor-to-ceiling windows and Instagram-worthy displays. She was waiting by the door, wearing a soft yellow dress that made her look fragile and beautiful.

""How did it go?"" she asked, searching his face.

Nathan pulled out his receipt and showed her. ""All taken care of. She signed everything without a fight.""

Forty blocks away, Amelia sat in an exam room at Mount Sinai, staring at the motivational posters on the walls. The paper crinkled under her as she shifted on the table.

""Mia, honey, are you absolutely sure about this?"" Dr. Harper Lopez pulled up a stool, her face creased with concern. ""You've been trying to get pregnant for months. Just last year you were asking me about fertility supplements.""

Amelia placed the courthouse receipt on the small table beside her, right next to the positive pregnancy test she'd taken yesterday morning.

""I'm sure,"" she said, her voice steady as stone.

""I want it gone.""

Chapter 3

Harper stared at the divorce paperwork like it might bite her.

She'd known Amelia for fifteen years, watched her completely lose herself over Nathan Harrison. The girl had literally restructured her entire life around that man—changed colleges, switched majors, turned down jobs in other cities. Harper had watched her best friend shrink into someone she barely recognized.

When they got married last year, Harper thought maybe it would finally be enough. Maybe Nathan would actually see what he had.

Apparently not.

""I'm done with him."" Amelia's voice was steady, matter-of-fact.

She smiled then—not the sad, hopeful smile Harper had gotten used to, but something real. For just a second, Harper saw a flash of the old Amelia. The girl who used to own every room she walked into, back when her dad was alive and the Visconti name still meant something in this city.

""Good,"" Harper said simply. ""About damn time.""

""Nathan doesn't know about the baby."" Amelia's fingers traced the edge of the exam table. ""There's a thirty-day waiting period for the divorce. I can't risk him finding out and trying to use it against me.""

Harper nodded. Made perfect sense. During the cooling-off period, either spouse could withdraw the petition. If Nathan knew about the pregnancy, he'd probably try to guilt her into staying.

""Okay, so here's the thing,"" Harper said, pulling up Amelia's file. ""We can't do the procedure right away. You're type AB-negative, which means we need to special-order blood just in case. It'll take about a week.""

Amelia's face went tight. AB-negative—her father's blood type. One more reminder of everything she'd lost.

""And Mia?"" Harper's voice went gentle. ""You're showing signs of threatened miscarriage. You need to be really careful the next few days. No stress, lots of rest.""

""What does that mean exactly?""

""Cramping, some spotting. Your body's... well, it's under a lot of stress right now. Just take it easy, okay?""

Harper squeezed her friend's shoulder. ""I'm off in like an hour. Want me to drive you home?""

""Yeah, that'd be great.""

Amelia headed to the waiting room, one hand instinctively pressed to her stomach. Was her body already making the decision for her?

Her phone buzzed. Bank alert—deposit from the new account she'd opened that morning. A text followed immediately.

Hey! Royalty check just went through. You should see it in your account now.

Before Nathan, Amelia had been a songwriter. Not the kind who performed—the kind who stayed in the background and crafted hits for other people. Her father had encouraged her music when she was young, back when money wasn't an issue. After he died and everything went to hell, those piano lessons became her survival.

Got it, thanks.

You know, you've written some of our biggest songs. Ever think about stepping into the spotlight? There's this new singing competition—all original material. I could get you an audition.

Amelia scrolled through the email her manager had sent. A reality show, basically, but focused on songwriting and original music instead of covers.

Maybe. Let me think about it.

She set her phone down as a sharp cramp hit her lower abdomen.

God, she missed her dad. If he could see her now...

Meanwhile, social media was having a field day:

\#VivianHopeCancer trending #1

\#FloralDesignerDying trending #3

\#TerminalDiagnosis trending #8

The top video had already hit two million views:

Celebrity floral designer Vivian Hope, known for her work with Manhattan's elite, revealed today that she has terminal stomach cancer and only six months to live. Instead of stepping away from public life, Hope plans to document her final months online.

In the video, Vivian looked ethereal—pale but beautiful, like some tragic heroine. ""I want to share this journey with everyone who might be going through something similar. To show that even when you're dying, you can still choose hope.""

The reporter's voice continued over B-roll footage: ""Hope has been romantically linked to Harrison Industries CEO Nathan Harrison, though Harrison recently married. Sources close to the situation say this could be a real-life tragedy worthy of Hollywood.""

Vivian stepped back into frame, interrupting with practiced grace. ""I'm not going to lie about my feelings. Nathan is... he's an incredible man. But he's married, and I respect that completely. I would never try to come between them.""

She walked away from the cameras, leaving the reporter to wrap up the segment.

The moment she was out of sight, Vivian slipped into a waiting Town Car. A woman in scrubs handed her a water bottle, looking nervous as hell.

""Spit it out,"" Vivian said without looking up from her phone.

The woman glanced at the driver, then leaned closer. ""Miss Hope, your actual diagnosis is just gastritis. Having us falsify medical records is already illegal, but now you're going public with it? What happens when people start digging?""

Vivian's smile was ice-cold. ""Is your clinic a licensed medical facility?""

""Yes, but—""

""Are my records stored independently?""

""Yes.""

""And what do those records say?""

The woman swallowed hard. ""Terminal stomach cancer. Six-month prognosis.""

""Exactly. So if anyone investigates, that's what they'll find."" Vivian's voice turned dangerous. ""And if complications arise later, we have options. Either I make a miraculous recovery thanks to some experimental treatment, or your clinic made a massive diagnostic error that put me through months of unnecessary trauma. Which scenario sounds better for your malpractice insurance?""

The fake nurse went white. ""I understand, Miss Hope. I'm sorry for questioning you.""

""Good. Now, we're going to New York Presbyterian.""

""Is that... safe?""

""I need to pick up some legitimate pain medication. Doctor's orders."" Vivian fired off a quick text to Nathan: At the hospital picking up meds. Can you meet me?

His response was instant: Already on my way.

Two floors up, Amelia sat in a bathroom stall, staring at the bright red blood on the tissue paper. Her hand pressed against her cramping stomach.

i’m on my 2nd week of 2.5mg. no weight loss drugs before this, just a really frustrating weight cycle of the same 5 pounds with a calorie deficit. 

i’ve already dropped below my plateau weight. yay! except, holy hell, this is taking a toll on my body. 

look, i know it’s important to eat and stay hydrated. but i didn’t believe it would be this hard. i have never EVER been one to say “i just can’t eat that” or “getting enough calories is too hard”. i actually thought that was BS and tried Zepbound out of desperation not convinced it would work. 

i’m constantly nauseous if i eat or drink anything above a certain amount. even keeping protein shakes in my diet is hard because it feels like so much volume. i have a 64 ounce stanley with 1 liquid IV packet every day for electrolytes. it takes me ALL day to get through 64 oz of water. i used to be able to down 2-3 of these if i wanted. 

i can’t even finish a venti coffee from starbucks. i can just barely finish a grande over several hours. and eating anything except a protein bar for the first 5 hours of my day? forget about it. 

because of this, i can’t do my regular 10k steps a day and i haven’t even been able to fathom doing my body weight exercises, which i know are so important for preventing muscle loss. 

i think a big part of me is struggling to accept that i should be trying to get *more calories* in. i guess im afraid ill get “too used” to that habit and then suddenly be super fat again/struggle with appetite regulation? i don’t feel “valid” enough yet to have to intentionally increase calories even though im getting 1k or below a day. 

it’s important to note that i’m a 1200isplenty vet. over there, we don’t eat things like straight peanut butter, full fat cheeses, etc. so it’s really hard to fathom adding stuff like that back in my diet when i struggled for so long to keep it tf out! so maybe some of this is mental? but there’s definitely a physical aspect as well. i don’t feel like i’ve been on it long enough to even feel this way.

1lx1aas,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lx1aas/buried_by_my_alpha_crowned_by_the_moon/,"BURIED BY MY ALPHA, CROWNED BY THE MOON","Chapter 1

Just a door away, the conversation in the corner of the medical wing continued.

""Get the OR ready. Remove her womb. Make sure it’s done before she wakes.""

The pack healer went rigid with shock.

""Alpha... Remove her womb?!""

""Alpha—you don't have an heir! You do this, the pack will have no heir. The pack elders will never accept it!""

Cassian's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.

""I don’t need an heir from Evelyn Carter. Annabelle delivered my heir yesterday. He will inherit everything. Evelyn’s womb is a threat.""

The healer's face crumpled with disbelief.

""But that boy will carry another man's name, call another man Alpha. After seven miscarriages, The chances of Luna carrying another are barely there.""

Cassian lit a cigarette, his voice bitter.

""Annabelle is my true mate, I’d do anything for her, I don't care some Moon Goddess pairing.""

""Alpha, but—""

""Enough."" He frowned. ""Do it.""

Just as Cassian got up to go, his phone buzzed. He hit speaker by mistake.

""Alpha, got the cash. Hell, after seven jobs, I could do this shit in my sleep. Next time, I’ll wear a vampire disguise—really carve up that Luna's belly—""

""No next time. Take your money and disappear from Moonvale.""

Footsteps approached from deeper inside.

I stumbled back to my room, barely making it to the bed before Cassian entered.

""Evelyn, you're up. When did you wake up?""

Sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to appear normal.

""Just woke up. You weren't here, so I thought I'd stretch my legs.""

His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face.

My wolf whimpered with terror. Just when I thought he'd caught me, he scooped me up and settled me back on the bed.

""Baby, you scared the hell out of me. We already lost our pup—I can't handle losing you too.""

He dared to mention our pup.

Thinking of all the puppies he'd murdered, I pressed a hand to my chest as grief threatened to overwhelm me.

Those accidents, the attacks, the fall—all of it orchestrated by my own mate.

""The heal needs to do a follow-up procedure. Just to make sure everything's healing properly.""

""I know losing the baby hurts, but we'll try again. We'll have the most beautiful pup—strong like their Alpha, gentle like their mother.""

Cassian handed me a vial of potion. In the brief moment he turned away, I saw a thick, dark liquid shimmer as something else mixed in and vanished.

He pulled me close, his expression soft with false concern.

But I could see through the mask now. Every gentle touch was a lie.

""Do I really need to drink this? I'm not very thirsty...""

Cassian, you've slaughtered seven of my children. Now you want to steal my very ability to be a mother?

He didn't even pause, stroking my hair with that practiced tenderness.

""Come on, don't be difficult. You need your strength to heal. You want your Alpha to worry himself sick?""

""Let me help you with that.""

He pressed the glass to my lips, his grip firm enough that refusal wasn't an option.

I closed my eyes, each swallow feeling like liquid fire burning down my throat.

As the drugs took hold, I saw the healer slip into the room through my blurring vision.

""Begin immediately. And...""

Cassian's voice dropped to barely a whisper.

""Make sure she can’t walk again.""

Chapter 2

""Alpha, is this really necessary? Isn’t that… a little too cruel?""

""Do it!""

I knew Cassian was always calculating and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me awake early would push him to such cruelty.

My puppy, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to walk—he was taking everything.

Cassian, is this how you treat the mate the Moon Goddess chose for you?

My wolf howled inside me, wild and silent with fury.

I screamed silently in despair, struggling to sit up, but the darkness pulled me deeper.

As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the healer's voice through the haze:

""Alpha, her womb has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""

Cassian's voice was filled with satisfaction. ""Good. Perfect.""

When I fully awakened, tears were falling onto my hands—his tears, so convincingly real.

""Evelyn, the healer says infection damaged your womb. You'll never be able to have children.""

I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.

Nothing. No sensation at all.

I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded:

""Cassian, what did you do to my legs?""

Tears streamed down his face, his voice breaking with practiced grief.

""There were complications with the anesthesia. You're paralyzed from the waist down.""

""Don't be scared, baby... no matter what happens, I'll never leave you. I'll always love you.""

I'd never realized what a gifted actor my mate was.

He dismissed the nurses, personally feeding me soup, cleaning my body, even tending to the post-surgical bleeding himself.

He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.

""You've suffered so much for our pack. I promise I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""

I studied his exhausted face, then looked away coldly.

""You should rest if you're tired.""

""I'll stay right here with you. Just call if you need anything.""

Once he was asleep, I reached for his second phone.

I'd always known about Cassian's other device—his ""work phone""—but had never thought to check it.

The password worked on the first try.

Annabelle's birthday.

The lock screen showed their wedding photo.

A wedding photo... He'd married her in secret. The white dress seared my eyes.

With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. He called her ""baby"" in every text.

Endless conversations that grew more horrifying with each scroll.

Every business trip had been a lie—excuses to be with her.

All those times I'd been hurt that he never came to my doctor appointments.

When physicians asked about the Alpha, I'd smile awkwardly and say he was busy with Alpha duties.

His standard response was always the same:

""I’ve been tied up with pack affairs. Check-ups aren't a big deal—I'd just be in the way. You can handle routine things yourself.""

But he'd attended every single one of Annabelle's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy, he never missed one.

He wrote about how excited he was for their child, calling them the most precious thing in his world.

Scrolling further, my heart shattered completely.

Every time I got pregnant, they planned how to kill my child.

Even the car accident from a year ago—Annabelle had been behind the wheel.

She'd said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone. Cassian had eagerly agreed.

His only instruction: ""Try not to kill her outright.""

They discussed hurting me and murdering my children as casually as commenting on the weather.

My nails dug into my palms until blood dripped between my fingers.

The photo album contained thousands of pictures—all of Annabelle. Candid shots, selfies together, morning scenes, walks, intimate dinners where he'd prepared special meals for her pregnancy...

There were 99+ videos. I switched to that section and felt ice water flood my veins.

Countless recordings of their intimate moments, like they were documenting every encounter.

Even role-playing scenarios that made my stomach turn.

I pressed my hand to my mouth, fighting nausea.

But worse were six videos labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way to ""Sixth.""

Realizing what they contained, bile rose in my throat as blood filled my mouth.

Chapter 3

I bit down hard on my lip and opened the sixth video.

Cassian and Annabelle were laughing together.

In front of them lay...my unboren puppy.

The blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My wolf howled in agony, the pain causing my stomach to cramp violently.

I couldn't hold back anymore, leaning over the bed rail as dry heaves wracked my body.

I didn't sleep that night, my wolf pacing restlessly in my mind as tears soaked through my hospital gown.

The next morning, Cassian brought me breakfast as usual—an elaborate spread he'd personally selected.

Pancakes, fresh fruit, coffee, pastries...

I'd once thought this was his way of showing love. Now I knew it was just thoughtless guilt, buying his way out of actually caring.

Remembering the videos, I dry heaved again.

Seeing my distress, Cassian's expression filled with concern:

""Still feeling sick? Damn it, this is all my fault. I hate seeing my mate like this.""

""I'm fine. I want to go home.""

Something flickered across Cassian's face—a moment of tension.

""You just lost another pup. My mother isn't... handling it well. If you go back to the pack house now, you'll just walk into a shitstorm. Maybe we should wait until things cool down.""

I said nothing, but his expression told me everything I needed to know.

That afternoon, while he was gone, I packed my things and wheeled myself to the pack house.

I rolled through the front door to find Annabelle curled up in Cassian's lap, both of them cooing over a baby whose scent carried unmistakable traces of Graves bloodline.

Margaret emerged from the kitchen with a bowl of bone broth, personally feeding Annabelle spoonful by spoonful.

The three of them looked like the perfect family unit.

The moment Margaret caught my scent, her eyes flashed with her wolf's displeasure.

""Well, well. Look what crawled back to the den. You've got some nerve showing your face here after what you've done.""

""My Alpha son treats you like a precious mate, and this is how you repay him? Another dead heir. You're cursed, and you're bringing that curse into our pack!""

""Annabelle is the one deserves to be Luna of the Moonvale Pack. Get out of my territory—you're poison to this pack.""

Annabelle followed Margaret's gaze to me, her eyes glittering with the triumph:

""Luna Margaret, don't be so harsh. What if Evelyn gets upset and starts spreading lies about Alpha and me to the other packs?""

""Let her try. No pack leader gives a damn what a barren she-wolf has to say.""

I knew Margaret had always despised me. She thought I was too headstrong for an Alpha's mate, too independent—that I'd challenge her son's authority instead of submitting properly.

Annabelle was everything she wanted: beautiful, submissive, making Cassian the center of her universe like a proper Luna should.

She'd only wanted Annabelle as her son's mate, but then Annabelle married into another pack, and I'd given up everything to be the perfect Alpha's mate.

Margaret had reluctantly accepted me into the pack.

But years of failed pregnancies had pushed her resentment to the breaking point.

Now that Annabelle was back—with Cassian's heir—Margaret felt free to unleash every bit of venom she'd been storing.

If only she knew that every one of those lost pups had been orchestrated by her beloved Alpha.

Every grandchild she'd mourned had been murdered by the woman she was now treating like precious pack treasure.

In the past, Cassian would have used his Alpha command to intervene. Now he sat there holding Annabelle's child, acting like he couldn't hear a word.

Annabelle nestled deeper into his arms:

""Cassian, you're paying more attention to the pup than to me. Your wolf is making mine jealous.""

Cassian's expression melted with adoration as he nuzzled her neck, scenting her:

""You know you're my true mate. But look what I have for you.""

I followed Annabelle's delighted gaze to a document on the coffee table: ""Pack Territory Transfer Agreement.""

""Oh my God, Cassian! You're giving me pack lands?""

She kissed the corner of his mouth, shooting me a triumphant look over his shoulder.

I smiled back coldly, my wolf finally going still in my mind.

Enjoy it while you can.

I’ll call him Mark, Mark and I knew each other from a common group of friends that I was introduced to by my ex five years ago but I never really had close contact with since they were only around during the summertime due to them living in a different city. Fast forward to a long fight with health issues and surgeries and drama and after a long battle with a toxic job environment had resulted in me using alcohol as a coping mechanism, Mark prohibited me from drinking even a drop of alcohol. Now, I’ve started a new job and I’m in a more relaxed and friendly environment. However, Mark has been accusing me of being controlling and not letting him go out and have fun with his friends, which I never really did to him. However when I have asked him to go out for a coffee with one of my coworkers he has raised assumptions about this being my cover story for going out with another guy. Now, since the start of my moving in with Mark, I’ve found various things like thongs, brushes, photo albums and letters from his exes lingering around the house. I’ve pleaded Mark to gather them up in a box so I can store them somewhere in the attic since it’s clear that he doesn’t want to throw them out. Now, I’ve been quite aware of this man’s exes from the still existing instagram posts with them, me being excluded from his account, but never actually come across them. A couple months ago, after my attempt, we met up with our friends at their house andddd guess who’s there too? His ex. The one that was in a relationship with before me. Now the story of their relationship is too long to explain now but lemme tell you, she didn’t want to leave him. *IMPORTANT NOTE*. Mark always had access to all my stuff and accounts but had always had his phone and each account locked from me and always is hiding his phone from me. Now back to the story, he obviously knew she was there but he never told me anything. I was dumbfounded and confused as I walked in and saw her, and during our stay here, her trying secondhandedly to get Mark to talk with him. Now after all this time, I’ve asked him to be more open and transparent with me and to pack up his exes stuff since I am living in the same house as him and apparently, the memories of his exes but he brushes me off all the time. 

*There are a lot more in this story that I haven’t covered, lemme know if you want me to get in details about them. ",3,1752221318.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

 Basically this one girl lets call her Val, was really talkative and liked to interact with everyone. She made a few flirty comments towards one of our guy friends back in November but he told her he had a gf at the time, then fast track to January, me and her talked a bit more because we were the only two in on Fridays. 

Val was pretty chill, she was easy to talk to but i did keep it civil cause i knew she had tried with one of our other guy friends. 

During this time she would send me funny memes and id respond and stuff, one day she came in holding one of our other guys friends hands and they said they were a thing now which came out of thin air as they had hardly spoke. 

The following day they came in and said they realised they weren't compatable and we all found this so funny their switchup. Anyways two days later it was valentine days and Val came in and asked did I want to go out with her that afternoon and i told her no as i had other plans. 

I thought after this she would stop trying to get with me but she seemed off one of the days so i just asked was she okay and we ended up going on a walk where she cried and told me she felt unworthy cause i rejected her. 

I was taken aback by this and a few weeks later she seemed to be returning to normal and I thought she would let it go and move onto someone else cause that what it appeared to be like. 

But one day she wanted me to make her a pinky promise over meeting her for a coffee and I said no i have class and she followed me to the library which was well past her class cause she wouldn't take no for an answer. I told her i couldn't go and i didnt really want to and she cried in front of me for like 10 minutes. 

Since we have similar friends were in the same circles and one night i got a voicr message from her saying she was going to stop pursuing me cause it was damaging her. Thought that was the end of it but then three weeks ago one of her best friends texted me asking was i into Val and I said no were just friends as I've stated several times throughout the months. 

Now i do feel bad that she cried but I want to know is she like a narcissist or just some immature person. ",1,1752221214.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1lx17r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1lx17r9/debilitating_illogical_stress_regarding/,"DEBILITATING illogical stress regarding recruiting, please help","I struggle to do anything with a loose structure. For example, studying for a class is so easy for me because there is an exact blueprint to follow. But things like extracurriculars, work, etc. have a much looser blueprint in my head, and that stresses me out. I just finished my first year at a T3 CS school and absolutely breezed through classes despite not having coded in high school. Logic comes incredibly easy to me because I have a background in competitive mathematics, and that just enables ease of learning, which I am very grateful for.

However, I struggle with quite literally everything else that has to do with professional/academic life. Less so struggle, since being around such affluent people at university has shown me a blueprint of what I should do, but more like I get paralyzing stress from it. The amount of stress I suffered from last year while recruiting for the SWE internship I am doing right now was actually insane. For example, thinking about adding something to my resume would give me weeks of stress until I finally got myself to do it. I still force myself to do things, but I am so confused about this unnatural stress I am getting. Especially when I get zero test anxiety or school anxiety.

I'm just confused. This is genuinely the only aspect of life that shakes me like this. And logically I know that there *is* a structure to follow to get a job/internship/etc. I'm a generally stable person; I live a balanced life with hobbies, exercise, friends, community involvements etc. But this is the one thing that stresses me out to an illogical extent. It's not that I can't work either; I'm doing well in my current internship (at a small tech company that I got by cold emailing). Also I am definitely a people person and have been able to network to my advantage. But despite knowing what I am supposed to do to get an internship, I am so stressed. Already so stressed thinking about recruiting for summer 2026 and how I should've started leetcoding months ago. And how I need to update my resume and start coffee chats and all of that.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for in making this post, and thank you to everyone who cares enough to read or drop advice.",1,1752221084.0,csMajors,0,1.0,False

1lx168f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lx168f/aita_if_i_dont_apologize/,Aita if I don’t apologize?,"Hi Reddit idk how to start this at all but I’m f(24) and my ex-boyfriend who I’m still currently living with is m(26). This is a very long story but am I wrong if I don’t apologize to him for our relationship being terrible? To get a better idea we’ve been dating since 2019. We shortly moved in together because my grandma kicked me out for dating him. His brother didn’t want me living with them so we moved into my mom’s house. At the time I was going to cosmetology school, but I dropped out due to lack of transportation. I was working at a small cafe but ultimately had to quit for the same reason I dropped out. We lived with my mom and we both worked odd jobs.y mother didn’t care about us paying bills she just wanted to help us get on our feet so we saved. Times got rough and Covid happened so I had a conversation with him a pretty long one about joking OF and making money there. He agreed and didn’t have a problem with it, I also asked if he was okay with it multiple times throughout the duration of it. He said he was fine with it, I made a lot of money from it. More than he made at his job at the time and more than I’ve ever made. I used the money to save up and pay for our lives while he worked at Amazon. I paid for our food, our hygiene products, even things we didn’t need like extra clothes for not only me but him too. I found out he was texting other women. I should’ve just ended it there but I gave it another chance because I was in love and young. It was stupid I know.

Eventually we moved in with his mother. I was still doing OF and still making a lot of money from it. He would argue with his mother pretty bad and I would have to be the mediator most of the time. I got pretty depressed because I didn’t want to do OF anymore and I felt self conscious but I still did it because it was during Covid still and we needed money. A lot of jobs weren’t hiring at the time either. Then I found out he cheated on me again. It wasn’t physical but does that really matter? He was texting so many girls. One day we got into an argument and he pushed me so hard it broke our shoe rack. His mother scolded him and I went to another room to collect myself. At the time I didn’t have anyone to call or anywhere to go to. (Which is another story on its own) that was in 2020.

In 2021 my grandmother passed and I became more depressed, then my cousin passed a few months after. I still made myself work on OF but most times I couldn’t get out of bed. I was just so defeated. We eventually moved out of his mother’s place and into our own apartment and everything got worse than I ever expected. I started working at Walmart and doing OF but we argued more and more. He got more physical, pushing me around, dragging me through the apartment, picking me up and not putting me down, hitting me, throwing things at me, destroying my belongings. I would fight back because what else could I do in the moment? My name was the only one on the lease and I had nowhere to go. (To clarify I was renting through my aunt but we aren’t close she keeps to her self and I did too) he got along well with my sibling and grandparents so I didn’t want to tell anyone what was going on because I loved him and I didn’t want anyone’s view and opinions of him to change.

In 2022 we moved back in with my mom. Then my brother was shot and paralyzed. It took a big toll on my entire family so we all packed up and moved to a suburban area that was safer. We argued there but he didn’t touch me at all. But he just kept cheating on me (and my dumb ass kept forgiving him because I loved him and I wanted it to work so bad. I wanted him to love me enough to stop. That was very foolish.) I was making even more on OF because I had more time. He was the only one with a car and I couldn’t drive so moving to a suburban area that relied heavily on vehicles made it hard for me to find work. He got a job at a furniture store and I put more time into OF and this time we helped my mom with bills and with my brother. My self esteem was at an all time low. I felt worthless unless I was making money. I was so far from everything I’ve known and my boyfriend just wouldn’t stop cheating on me. Eventually he moved out and back with his brother. I had a terrible mental breakdown because I thought I lost the love of my life, I felt disgusting mentally and physically, and I was working dumb odd jobs so I could make up for his absence. We had two cats at the time and he just left them with me and didn’t care. I ended up having to rehome them because I wasn’t in the right headspace to care for them. I could barely care for myself. We eventually made up and had a long distance relationship. I worked myself sick. One day my mother was supposed to pick me up from work and she forgot about me and ignored my texts. I paid for an uber and went home but I didn’t have a key. My brother had to struggle to get to his wheelchair and open the door. I helped him back to bed and made sure he was okay but that was my breaking point and I couldn’t take it anymore. I was freezing because I was outside in the Midwest winter for a few hours while being sick then my mom yelled at me and would have rather spend time with her boyfriend than help me then got on me about dishes when I just wanted to take a nap because I was feeling like caca. So I called him and he picked me up and his brother allowed me to live with them. His brother helped me get a job and I was extremely grateful because I could stop doing OF. Then I found out while we were long distance he invited a girl to his place and she and I had a bad history so I was just crushed. He claimed they didn’t do anything together but I was just done. I hadn’t had time to process anything I was going through at all so I shut off my feeling and just went to work and went home and stayed in our room and slept the repeated this for over a year. He was occasionally physical but was mostly verbally abusive. His brother noticed and started calling him out and telling him it wasn’t right. His brother witnessed him smack my AirPods out of my ear and he talked to him again. At that point I did something I wasn’t proud of. After the many years of verbal, physical, and mental abuse I cheated on him. I feel terrible about it still. I met a guy and I explained to him my entire situation and he listened and talked to me and made me feel idk validated and heard? I feel more bad about sleeping with him than I do about cheating on my ex. I eventually broke it off and apologized and he understood. My ex found out about it and understandably went ballistic. He kicked me out and I packed a small bag and started walking to my nearest family members house which was my other grandmother. While I was doing that he followed me and got physical again by restraining me and when I didn’t reply to him he would shake me around. I couldn’t do anything but cry and try to get away. I broke down and explained to him how he treated me and how I just wanted to leave and that I was sorry. We eventually calmed down and went back to his place.

In 2023 we got our own place together. Both of our names are on the lease and we still currently live here. I eventually had to quit my job because I drilled through my hand…..yeah ik that’s crazy and stupid. The abuse got worse. Then I found out he was cheating on me again with 2 different women. I had lost count of how many times that happened. But he just never stopped and he constantly threw my physical affair in my face whenever he got the chance. Then he started beating me and gaslighting me saying he wasn’t hitting me bc he wasn’t punching me. I worked for his mom for a bit got pregnant and miscarried. Which made me spiral and I stopped working. I lost all of my friends I had no one not even him, not that I ever had him in the first place. I stayed jobless and remain jobless because the longer I waited it got harder and harder to find a job which made me more depressed. He would get upset that I couldn’t pay for anything so I started doing OF again and using all of that money to help out. Until I just couldn’t anymore. It took a huge toll on me. I get that I was barely pulling my weight but I kept telling him I need help and he just refused to hear me or care. One of my customers who didn’t care about pictures or anything gives me money in exchange of having my private social media. He pays me every two weeks $400 which isn’t a lot but it’s enough to get by and I’m ever so grateful for him. My ex knew about it very well and didn’t care and was happy I was contributing again. But it wasn’t enough. The abuse went on and kept getting worse until a few months ago when he choked me, broke our door, slammed me on our coffee table, and choked me inside of our bathtub. But it wasn’t abuse because I deserved it because I was yelling and wouldn’t shut up. I ended up calling his brother in secret while he was still going on and his brother rushed over and helped me pack and made him leave. I called my mom and I begged her to pick me up. I explained everything I wrote here to her and she got a u-haul truck and since most of the apartment is my belongings I packed up and moved in with her. I was feeling better. Happier. I became a nurse to my living grandmother and I enjoyed our time. I started getting my life back together with help from my mom, I was just happier eventhough sometimes I would miss my ex because we had some good moments together. I started my journey of becoming a life insurance agent. It was great and I foolishly thought that hey since most of our problems stemmed from me not working maybe we can work it out and talk about things better now that I’m doing better. I would visit our apartment then it became longer and i eventually moved back. I felt as if I had broken out of my depression and I started doing more around our place, I was still taking care of my grandmother also. I noticed I was doing most of the work and instead of approaching it like I used to I would calmly ask him to help and it never came only when I would pester him. Then we would end up arguing no matter how much I tried to avoid it. We had a long conversation and I told him if he hurts me again we’re just done. Then we argued and he ended up grabbing my arm so hard it bruised. I realized nothing I did was enough for him. It doesn’t matter he just never cared and wants to hurt me. So I just slipped back into my old ways of just sleeping, not cleaning or cooking as often as I should’ve. And just sulking. I was the only one cleaning and cooking at all so if I didn’t do it, it wouldn’t get done. I felt like I had no say in my living arrangement or anything in my life. I became more depressed and had thoughts of not being here anymore than before and I think that was when I just turned everything off and I just didn’t care if we ended things or anything. Lately I just kept to myself and avoided him unless we were having a smoke sesh. Or unless his friends came over. Whenever we argued I just bluntly told him I just don’t care. I don’t have the energy to argue. He didn’t like that and the more I said it the worse it got. He tried to pick me up and throw me out of the house and I had to barricade myself in my room with a taser, knife, and the bed pushed against the door. I told him I didn’t feel safe while he was actively trying to break the door down. He said he didn’t care and kept telling me to move the bed and I kept saying no and hyperventilating and telling him he’s scaring me. He said I keep making his life hard. He said he didn’t care if he’s scaring me and I had to tell him I’m scared that he’s going to kill me and he said if I didn’t open the door and get out of the house I would be on a dead list. I ended up falling asleep on the floor and  a few hours later he talked to me more calmly through the door and I had to fake like I was okay to not upset him. I knew it was beyond over by then. That was on June 28th. We’ve been cold and distant since then and he’s upset that I just won’t talk to him about anything anymore. He promised he wouldn’t do it again but at this point I just know not to ever trust him. About two days ago we got into a petty argument and he said he wanted me out and nothing to do with me. I told him my name is on the lease so I’m not going anywhere until I can find another apartment for myself. I can’t go back to my moms or anyone else’s because it would be extremely hard to find work or commute anywhere. So staying here would financially benefit us both since he can’t afford groceries or toiletries. If I left all of his appliances would be gone and he would just have a couch, tv, bed, and video game. I haven’t contributed to the rent because I’m still not working and the money I do get goes to groceries, hygiene products, cleaning supplies, and basic necessities. We agreed that I could stay here for a few months but we aren’t together at all. I cook, I clean, and I’ll watch his nephew in the meantime. That’s what we agreed on. But now he wants to talk about how I’ve been treating him since we moved in and he wants me to apologize for using him. I don’t feel like apologizing. I’ve been pushed beyond my breaking point and I just can’t bring myself to do it anymore. He keeps telling me to say something or acknowledge how he feels and I just don’t care. I just want to save my money and leave. In his defense I haven’t been working, but whenever I have money it’s always spend on necessities that he can’t cover or on the both of us. So Reddit AITA? If you need more information I’m willing to answer as best as I can.

Cameron Mitchell's voice was as warm and gentle as ever, yet his words sent a chill through my entire body.

So what I'd mistaken for redemption… was nothing but charity.

In his heart, there had only ever been one woman—Lucy Wendell.

Fine. I would step aside and give them my blessing.

…

The archive room door stood slightly ajar. Cameron's voice drifted out, thick with remorse.

""I had no choice. I already hurt Lucy once—I couldn't let anything happen to her mother, too. As for Marianne… I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to her.""

The deputy director's voice dropped, but the anger beneath was unmistakable.

""But that surgery seven years ago—you could've saved them both! You ripped out Marianne's mother's kidney just to give it to Lucy's mom! If this gets out, you won't just lose your license—you'll go to prison! All for a woman who never loved you back. Was it worth it?""

Not even a second of hesitation.

Cameron's reply struck like lightning through my chest. ""Worth it.""

His words exploded in my skull, leaving a deafening roar in their wake.

""Then keep this buried. Don't let her find out. Don't forget—Marianne's been a journalist for years. You ruined yourself over Lucy… but have you ever stopped to think? You destroyed Marianne, too.""

""Let her find out if she wants. If it comes to that, I'll take the fall. At least I've saved enough to ensure she'll live a rich life.""

His tone was disturbingly calm, as if discussing the forecast.

""Cameron, I just don't get you. Whatever—there's no reasoning with you…""

Their voices faded.

Footsteps approached—the sharp click of leather shoes against tile.

Panicked, I turned to leave—but my skirt snagged on the shelf.

The scalding coffee in my hand sloshed over my white dress, seeping through the fabric and burning my skin.

The pain was sharp, but it was nothing compared to the raw, jagged hole splitting open in my chest.

So this was my marriage. Built on lies and sacrifice.

My mother hadn't died from some tragic complication. She'd been murdered—sacrificed for my husband's precious first love.

Seven years ago, my ex-fiancé Nicholas Martin's betrayal made me the laughingstock of the city.

And Cameron's proposal? It had been bought with my mother's life.

Every tender word, every gentle touch—none of it had been love. Just guilt. Atonement.

Now, it all made sense.

Why the hospital's best ward was always reserved for Lucy's charity cases. Why he personally escorted her whenever she visited. Even our wedding rings were custom-designed in her favorite style.

I was the fool. Parading around in this hollow marriage, flaunting a love that was never real. Just another one of Cameron's pity projects.

Did Lucy laugh every time she saw me?

Did she struggle to keep a straight face, watching me play the oblivious clown?",1,1752220713.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Rain smacked the windshield, like someone spilled a bucket of marbles.

The wipers struggled frantically, but couldn't make a dent in the crazy downpour.

I sat in the passenger seat, twisting my seatbelt around my finger. The rain turned the world outside into a blurry watercolor, but I couldn't stop staring.

""Liam, are you sure about this?"" My voice sounded tight in the closed space. ""If you pull out now, the company will immediately plunge into a liquidity crisis.""

Liam's face looked chiseled from ice in the dashboard's blue glow.

His slender fingers drummed an impatient rhythm on the steering wheel.

I turned to lock eyes with him. ""But this is our life's work! Five years, since college—we built this from scratch. How can you just throw it away?""

A lightning bolt sliced through the night, briefly highlighting Liam's clenched jaw. Just then, his phone rang.

The caller ID simply read: \[Margie\].

Instantly, Liam's expression changed. He snatched up the call, his voice going all soft. ""What's up?""

A woman's voice mumbled through the speaker—I couldn't make out words, but every second, Liam's frown got deeper.

""Alright, I'll be right there."" He hung up, hit the turn signal, and jerked the wheel sharply onto another road.

""Liam? Where are we heading? We didn't finish talking—""

""Margaret's in trouble,"" he said curtly and stomped on the gas.

My heart clenched as if an invisible hand was squeezing it.

Margaret Smith was Liam's college sweetheart, the eternally pure and perfect first love he could never forget.

Ever since she came back half a year ago, she'd been the trigger for endless arguments between Liam and me.

""What's so urgent?"" I struggled to keep my voice even. ""It's pouring outside, and we were in the middle of a major talk.""

Liam didn't even glance at me. ""She's home alone with a 102-degree fever. Chloe, stop being unreasonable.""

Unreasonable? My lips parted, but no sound escaped.

The company was on the brink of collapse, and he was rushing off to tend to his ex-girlfriend just because she had a damn fever?

The car screeched to a violent halt at a bus stop.

Liam finally turned to me, his gaze glacial. ""Get out.""

""What?"" I thought I must have misheard.

""Get out,"" he repeated coldly. ""It's close enough to your place. Hail a cab yourself.""

He unlocked the car door, adding, ""Margaret can't wait any longer.""

The rain lashed against the car window, matching the frantic pounding of my heart.

I stared at Liam, the man I'd loved for seven years, utterly stunned. ""Are you serious? There's a freaking storm out there!""

""So what?"" Liam retorted. ""You're a grown woman, Chloe.""

I stared straight into his eyes, hunting for any flicker of regret, but met only glacial indifference.

At that moment, something clicked inside me, but I couldn't quite put it into words.

""Fine,"" I heard myself say, my fingers trembling as they fumbled with the seatbelt. ""You'd do anything for Margaret, right?""

Liam didn't answer.

I pushed the car door open, and the storm slammed into me, soaking half my body in an instant.

Just as I stepped out, his icy voice cut through. ""Take your umbrella.""

He tossed my folding umbrella onto my lap, as if that was the last shred of mercy he could show me.

I stood in the downpour, watching his black Mercedes splash through the puddles and speed off. Its taillights blurred in the rain, then vanished completely.

Water streamed down my hair, mingling with my still-warm tears.

I unfolded the umbrella numbly, only to find myself at a pitch-black street corner.

My phone battery icon flashed red—5% left. I dialed Liam's number, my hands shaking.

""The number you have dialed is busy...""

I took a deep breath and turned toward the main road.

The rain was so heavy that my umbrella might as well have been tissue paper. My clothes clung to me, soaking wet and freezing me to the bone.

Just then, blinding highlights exploded from the corner.

Instinctively, I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the screech of skidding tires pierced the air.

Suddenly, time seemed to slow down. I watched in horror as the out-of-control truck careened toward me, the driver's panicked face clear through the windshield.

Then came the deafening crash of metal on flesh.

Weirdly, I felt no pain.

Instead, I felt weightless, like a feather caught in the wind.

I hovered above, staring down in bewilderment.

There lay a woman, her body contorted at an unnatural angle, crimson blood spreading through the rainwater.

That face...was mine.

Was I dead?

The thought hit me, but strangely, I wasn't panicking.

I watched calmly as the truck driver got out to check, his face deathly pale as he made a call. Then, he jumped back in and fled the scene.

The rain kept pouring, relentlessly washing away ""my"" blood from the pavement.

I floated above my body, feeling this weird sense of peace—at least, Liam would find out...

Just then, the familiar black Mercedes came sliding back.

Liam staggered out and dropped to his knees beside my body.

My chest tightened—he did come back for me.

But the next second, he pulled out his phone. Instead of calling 911, he dialed his lawyer, Henry Chester.

""Henry,"" Liam said, his voice eerily calm. ""Chloe got hit by a car. Yeah, died on the spot. No, I don't know the vehicle. Surveillance? I don't believe there are any cameras in this area.""

I hovered above, watching in horror as he methodically cleaned up the scene with practiced ease.

He even pried the phone from my dead hand and deleted our final call log.

The wail of sirens from police cars and ambulances grew louder as they drew near.

Liam instantly put on a mask of devastating grief, bursting into exaggerated sobs as he cradled my body.

Had I not seen the whole thing, I would never have believed anyone could fake grief so perfectly.

""Oh, Chloe!"" he wailed, his voice all cracked. I floated right in front of him and stared into his eyes—they were bone-dry, not a single tear to be found.

Finally, the rain ceased.

Cold moonlight shone down on my body, and on Liam's trembling back as he kept up the act.

I hovered above this surreal scene. For the first time, I realized I might have never truly known Liam, the guy I spent seven years loving.

# Chapter 2

The day of my funeral broke with a bright morning.

Sunlight streamed through the funeral home's stained-glass windows, dancing across the white roses.

My framed portrait dominated the memorial hall—front and center. It was taken at last year's company gala, where I wore a bright red dress and beamed at the camera.

Beneath it lay a glass casket, and inside rested my meticulously made-up corpse.

Floating above the hall in my ghostly form, I watched everything unfold below, struck by the sheer absurdity of it all.

""Chloe, my baby girl."" Mom collapsed beside the casket. Her gut-wrenching sobs pierced through me like shards of glass.

Dad, his eyes bloodshot, was supporting her. His once-straight back was now hunched, as if he had aged a decade overnight.

I drifted over, reaching out to hug them, but my arms went right through.

""Mom, Dad, I'm right here,"" I called out, but my voice just vanished.

The hall was packed with a steady stream of visitors—my colleagues, college classmates, and distant relatives.

Dressed in black, they walked up to my portrait with solemn faces, put down the white roses, and then offered their condolences to my parents.

Lily from the marketing department wept more bitterly than anyone else.

My best friend, Jessica Lynn, seven months pregnant, sobbed uncontrollably in her husband's arms.

Liam was the one who really stood out.

He stood at the entrance to the memorial hall in his impeccably tailored black suit, greeting each mourner with calculated grace.

His eyes were bloodshot, his face as white as a sheet. His tie hung loosely around his neck, as if grief had drained him of even the strength to straighten himself up.

He responded to each condolence with artfully trembling lips and tearful restraint—a masterclass in feigned grief.

""Mr. Goodman, I'm sorry for your loss.""

""Liam, Chloe wouldn't want to see you like this.""

""Mr. Goodman, the company needs you.""

Liam nodded faintly to each mourner, expressing his thanks in a carefully hoarse voice.

His performance was flawless, if only I didn't already know the monster beneath the mask.

I floated right before him, so close I could count each of his eyelashes.

His eyes were red and swollen, but I knew the truth—he'd been rubbing onions last night. I saw it with my own eyes.

Pretending to bow his head in grief, he quickly stole a glance at his phone's lock screen.

There was a text from Margaret: \[What do you want for dinner? I made you some soup\], with a heart emoji at the end.

The corner of Liam's lips twitched upward almost imperceptibly for a split second before snapping back into his mask of grief.

A bone-chilling terror shot through me, freezing me to the very core.

""Liam Goodman!"" I shrieked, throwing myself at him with all my strength. But I just went right through, almost falling over from the force.

Liam remained still, without so much as a flicker of his lashes.

Soon, the memorial service started.

As my ""fiancé,"" Liam was called upon to deliver the eulogy.

He trudged up to the podium and fished a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket.

He began, his voice trembling, ""Chloe was the most important person in my life.""

The audience erupted in muffled sobs.

I scoffed.

That paper was the business pitch I'd helped him rewrite last month. He'd just grabbed it the last second.

I couldn't know more about the handwriting there.

""We first met on campus in college, and she always had such a radiant smile.""

It was true that we met in college. But back then, he was the one with a bright smile.

That year, he was the student council president, while I headed the arts department.

He played and sang ""Long Live"" at the orientation party, having half the girls swooning—me most of all.

""She was kind-hearted, resilient, and radiated an undying zest for life.""

That part was painfully true.

How kind of me to believe his every word, how strong to endure his never-ending thing with Margaret all these years, and what a zest for life—I couldn't even let my afterlife self rest in peace.

As Liam's eulogy concluded, the entire hall dissolved into sobs.

He staggered off the stage, supported by several colleagues, and slumped into his seat. Bowing his head, he buried his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking.

No one noticed him secretly checking a selfie from Margaret between his fingers—she was wearing my nightgown, posing in our bedroom.

After the funeral, Liam made a show of escorting everyone out.

As soon as the hall cleared, he heaved a long sigh of relief, loosened his tie, and called Margaret.

""Yeah, it's finally over. I'm beat. Of course I miss you."" His voice was light and playful, a stark contrast to his earlier grief. ""I'll be home in twenty. Wear that black lace lingerie for me, okay?""

Numb, I drift after him out of the funeral home and slip into the black Mercedes-Benz.

There was still a faint metallic smell in the car—my blood.

Seemingly oblivious to it all, Liam turned on the stereo and played some upbeat jazz.

The black Mercedes glided into the underground garage of an apartment.

It had been the place we called home. But now, it was a love nest for him and Margaret.

As the elevator climbed, Liam checked his reflection in the mirror, smoothing his hair and even spritzing some breath freshener.

I stood aside, staring at him. Once, I loved him with all my heart, but now all I felt was pure disgust.

The moment the door opened, Margaret threw herself into his arms.

She wore a silk slip dress, her hair cascading in soft waves, looking every bit like a delicate doll.

""Liam."" She tilted her face up, her eyes shimmering with tears. ""Today must have been hard for you, right?""

Liam instantly went all weak and tired-looking. ""Mmm, at least I have you,"" he murmured before lowering his lips to hers.

I turned away sharply. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't block out the wet, intimate sounds of their kissing.

My gut twisted with a nausea that shouldn't even exist anymore. I floated to the bedroom to escape, but what I saw there just made my heart ache even more.

All my belongings were gone.

My skincare on the vanity, my favorite aromatherapy diffuser by the bed, and all my clothes in the wardrobe—every last trace of me had been wiped clean.

Instead, there were Margaret's dresses and designer handbags.

Among the paired toothbrushes and towels in the bathroom, none was mine.

Liam embraced Margaret from behind, his chin resting on her shoulder. ""You did a great job cleaning,"" he murmured.

""The cleaning service came today,"" Margaret said softly. ""I had all her belongings packed up and sent to her parents' place. You don't mind, do you?""

""Of course not. You did the right thing."" Liam brushed a kiss against her earlobe and added, ""Keeping her stuff around would only make it harder to move on.""

I floated right in their faces, glaring at Liam down. ""You're lying!"" I shrieked. ""You called the cleaning service yesterday, before my body was even cold!""

Of course, he couldn't hear me.

""Liam."" Margaret nestled against Liam's chest. ""Sometimes, I get scared thinking—what if you hadn't made her get out of the car that day because of me?""

""Shh."" Liam pressed a finger to her lips. ""This isn't your fault. Blame the truck driver, or maybe Chloe just wasn't careful enough.""

He cupped her face in his hands, whispering, ""We deserve happiness, Margie.""

I froze in mid-air.

They just brushed off my death like it was nothing? Just started a brand new life together, without a shred of guilt?

Rage poured through me.

I focused all my energy and charged at the glass on the coffee table—it didn't budge.

But Margaret suddenly screamed, her fingers digging into Liam's arm.

""What's wrong?"" Liam's eyes swept the room, instantly alert.

""J-Just now, it felt like someone sighed right in my ear."" Margaret's face went deathly pale.

Liam let out a sigh of relief and chuckled, rubbing her cheek. ""You're imagining things, darling. We're alone.""

I froze.

Margaret heard me?

With every ounce of my strength, I screamed at her, ""Get the hell out of my home!""

Margaret shivered violently. ""Liam, I'm freezing all of a sudden.""

Liam tightened his embrace. ""Maybe the air conditioning's just too cold."" He grabbed the remote and turned up the temperature. ""Don't overthink things, hmm?""

For days, I drifted through the apartment like a ghost struck in a loop, haunting the spaces that brimmed with memories.

I watched them having sex in my bed, cooking together in my kitchen, and watching the sunset on my balcony. Each scene tore me apart from inside.

I had tried every trick I could think of to get their attention.

I tried to make noise while they were being intimate, to create distractions while Margaret was looking in the mirror, and even to scream in their ears while they were asleep. But nothing worked.

The only time I succeeded was when I made the curtains sway slightly, but Liam dismissed it as ""the window not being shut right.""

On the evening of the seventh day, I hovered outside the balcony, watching the setting sun stain the clouds blood-red.

Liam and Margaret were discussing their wedding plans in the living room. They wanted to tie the knot within three months after my death. They said fate always changed, and they should seize the moment.

I stared at my see-through hands, finally realizing one truth.

I was dead, and to the living, I was fading away.

My brother had hated me for seven years.

The last time we argued, I stormed out during a downpour, furious and reckless. I ended up falling into a river, and when I woke up, my memory was a mess.

At the hospital, he looked relieved—like a weight had finally been lifted. He pointed casually at a terminally ill patient and said, ""That's your real brother.

""Get it straight. Don't bother me again.""

The pale-faced man walked over, gently stroked my head, and said softly, ""Come on, I'll take you home.""

After that, I went to great lengths to save this so-called ""brother."" I braved a snowstorm to find a specialist, stayed up countless nights to watch over him.

I even risked my own life for him.

Then, one day, my real brother stood in the freezing snow and blocked my path, his voice shaking in panic.

""You really… don't remember me?""

The doctors had warned of memory confusion. I'd just woken up in the hospital.

Falling from such a height into the river had given me a severe concussion. I'd been in a coma for over two weeks.

Two weeks ago, I had a huge fight with my brother, Charley Lyons.

Right before slamming the door behind me, I shouted, ""I'd rather die than have you clean up after me!""

His face twisted in fury, and behind me I heard his cold, mocking laugh.

""Then I hope you get your wish.""

But now, two weeks had passed—and I was still alive.

When I opened my eyes, the soft winter sunlight streamed through the hospital window.

It took a while for my vision to clear, and then I started to hear things.

Outside the room, I could make out the voices of the doctor and Charley.

""Trauma to the head, extended coma—

""memory loss or confusion is very likely,"" the doctor said.

""It's not just about forgetting friends and family. In some cases, they forget who they are entirely…""

I forced myself out of bed, wanting to explain that my memory was fine.

I hated hospitals.

I didn't want this diagnosis to become another reason to keep me trapped here.

Just as I reached the door, I heard Charley's low voice.

There was something in it—cold, yes, but also strangely pleased.

""This might actually be for the best,"" he said.

As if trying to prove the doctor's point, he added, ""She woke up briefly last night, looked at me, and asked who I was.""

He wasn't lying. I vaguely remembered that moment.

But I'd only asked because I wasn't fully conscious, and everything had been a blur—I couldn't even make out his face.

My hand froze on the doorknob.

The doctor tried to offer reassurance.

""There's no need to jump to conclusions. We'll know more once your sister wakes up.

""And even if there is memory loss, we can work on recovery…""

But Charley cut him off.

""No. It's better if she forgets. Don't try to bring it back.""

I could even hear the trace of joy he didn't bother to hide.

So that's what he really wanted? For me to forget him?

After everything… after all the fights since Mom and Dad passed… he's the only family I have left.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

But now that I'd survived, I just wanted one more chance to talk to him.

I pulled open the door.

Our eyes met—his filled with surprise, then quickly turning cold and distant.

I'd been unconscious too long.

When I spoke, my voice was hoarse, ""I actually…""

Charley's brows knit together, disbelief flashing across his face.

But then, almost like trying to convince himself, he made up his mind.

He assumed I was confused—mistaking someone else for him.

In the hallway, people came and went, oblivious.

It was like he couldn't wait to get rid of me. Without even looking, Charley reached out, pointed randomly at a patient walking by, and said, ""That's your brother.""

For a moment, I thought I must have misheard him.

I stared at him, stunned. ""What?""

Something flickered in his eyes—hesitation, maybe even guilt—but it vanished almost instantly.

We'd been siblings for over twenty years.

No matter how much he hated or resented me, I couldn't believe he'd push me toward a total stranger while I was still bruised, broken, and barely back on my feet.

Right then, I thought—maybe we really needed to talk. Really talk.

I opened my mouth, ready to put the bitterness behind me.

But he cut in again, his tone sharp and final, ""I said, that's your brother.

""Don't call the wrong person again. And stop coming to me.""

This time, he'd made up his mind.

When he motioned again to the man who had stopped nearby, his face showed no trace of doubt—just cold determination.

The doctor had already slipped away, probably not wanting to get involved.

People flowed through the hallway, slowing down to glance at me—curious, uncomfortable.

To them, I probably looked like a girl who'd gone off the deep end after nearly drowning—so out of it I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

The man Charley pointed to stood quietly across the hall, leaning against the wall.

Tall, well-built, with striking features—but pale. Deathly pale.

Anyone else would've been angry to be dragged into something like this.

But he wasn't. He simply looked at Charley, then at me. Calm. Silent.

Like he was waiting to see what would happen next.

Charley spoke again, voice colder than ever, ""I'm just a friend of your brother's. I came to check in out of politeness.

""If you want to talk to him, go find him yourself. Whether he accepts you or not—that's up to you two.""

And with that, he turned and walked down the hall, never looking back.

My hand, hanging at my side, started to tremble.

I kept telling myself—it's fine. He's hated me for years. This shouldn't be a surprise.

So what if I lost a brother who never wanted me? It's not like we ever really got along anyway.

But my eyes still burned, and I couldn't stop the tears from rising.

Shock. Shame. Anger. Frustration.

The emotions crashed into each other until I couldn't even form a single word.

I watched him walk away, the world tilting slightly as I grabbed the doorframe to steady myself.

A loud ringing filled my ears. For a long time, I couldn't pull myself back together.

Then, the man who had been silently watching finally moved.

He let go of the wall and slowly walked toward me.

For a second, I thought he might come over and scold me—accuse me of faking, of making a scene.

Now that Charley had left, I was the only one left to blame.

I instinctively tried to take a step back.

But maybe I'd been in bed too long. Maybe my emotions had drained every last bit of strength.

My body didn't move.

Then, before I could even process what was happening—

A hand gently landed on my head.

At first, it felt almost like a scolding tap—but there was no force behind it.

Just a soft, almost tentative touch. A pat.

It was a long moment before he finally spoke.

His voice was tired, but gentle. ""Come on. Let's go. I'll take you home.""

How many years had it been since Charley last called himself my brother?

Too long. So long I'd forgotten what it felt like.

I looked up at him, dazed.

We'd been fighting for years.

Ever since our parents died.

Maybe I really had gone crazy.

Because I stared at this complete stranger—a man I'd never seen before in my life—and still, I nodded.

""Okay.""

# Chapter 2

I followed a stranger back to a home I'd never seen before.

The place was spotless—so clean, it felt cold. Lifeless.

Not a speck of dust anywhere. No signs of anyone actually living there.

It reminded me of him—his pale, expressionless face. Too still. Too quiet.

Years ago, a place like this might've scared me. But now, life or death didn't matter much to me anymore. There was nothing left that I'm afraid of.

I glanced around the room. On the coffee table were several small white pill bottles. I recognized them instantly—they were the same kind I'd once tried to collect.

But doctors were always cautious.

No matter what excuse I gave—stress, insomnia, anxiety—they never gave me more than a few at a time.

I'd spent six months saving them up and still barely managed to get a dozen.

Now, looking at all those full bottles, I almost laughed.

And surprisingly, I felt a flicker of envy.

That many pills… more than enough to die.

Next to the bottles sat a photo.

It was strange—black and white, about a foot wide.

The man in the picture looked straight into the camera. Calm. Blank. Completely emotionless.

It stood out so much I couldn't help but stare.

Then I glanced at the man standing beside me—his face practically a mirror of the one in the photo. Same expression. Same stillness.

Even after he saw me notice the pills and the photo, his face didn't change.

Without a word, he calmly walked over, gathered them up, and tucked everything into a drawer.

Then he turned to me and said gently, ""Sit down. I'll make you something to eat.""

So he really believed it. He thought my head was so messed up I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

That thought pulled me back to reality.

Lying to someone already standing on the edge—it didn't sit right with me.

I wanted to tell him the truth. Then leave.

But the image of that photo, those pills… they stayed with me.

And suddenly, I was curious. What had he been through that pushed him so close to the edge? Just like me?

Where did he even get that many pills?

Before I knew it, I'd sat down.

He went into the kitchen. Said he was going to cook. But for a long time, I didn't hear a thing.

I got up and walked to the kitchen door.

He was standing there, staring blankly into the open fridge.

It was as empty as the rest of the apartment.

Not a single ingredient. Not even a bottle of water.

Clearly, no one had cooked here in a long time.

The stovetop was bare—no pots or pans, just a single ceramic jar. The kind used for boiling medicine.

He stood there for a while before finally snapping out of it.

He shut the fridge and turned to look at me.

His voice was soft, almost apologetic. ""Sorry. I forgot to buy groceries. I'll go out and get something.""

Over the years, I'd looked at myself in the mirror and thought, I'm alive, but I don't feel it. Like I've become some hollow soul, floating outside my own body.

But standing there in that kitchen, I realized—

There was someone else out there who looked even more like the dead than I did.

He walked past me and headed toward the door.

And I realized—I couldn't hear his footsteps. Couldn't even hear him breathe.

It suddenly occurred to me—maybe this stranger, someone I'd just met today, wasn't planning on coming back.

Just like that night… after my fight with Charley. When I fell into the river.

Charley and the doctors had both insisted it was an accident—that the rain was too heavy, the bridge too slick.

That I'd slipped.

But I knew better.

He was already at the entryway, hand on the door, just about to step out.

I looked at his back and said, without thinking, ""I like fish.""

He froze.

Stiffened slightly, then slowly turned to face me.

His expression unchanged—calm, pale, unreadable. ""What?"" he asked.

I met his gaze and repeated, ""I said, I want fish.

""For dinner. Can you make that for me?""

The front door was still ajar.

Cold wind blew in—late autumn, almost winter.

It rushed through the apartment, tugging at the hem of his coat and messing up his already disheveled hair.

Against the wind, his face looked even more bloodless. Almost ghost-like.

His fingers, hanging by his side, gave the slightest twitch.

After a long pause, he nodded. ""Okay.""

I watched him walk out. The door clicked shut behind him.

Maybe—just maybe—he'd actually come back.

The thought made me laugh at myself.

I was someone who'd been ready to end it all.

And yet here I was… worrying about whether a stranger might not return.

I sank back into the couch and closed my eyes. The same images came rushing back.

My parents—who should've been alive and well—crushed beneath the rubble.

And me, pulled out alive, surviving by stepping over the lives of the two people who loved me most.

The scene shifted—Charley's face filled with rage, his voice sharp and bitter.

""Erma, you're the one who should've died. That would've been justice.""

""After all these years, do you really sleep with a clear conscience?""

No. I didn't.

That was why I hadn't had a single night of real rest in years.

I slipped into a nightmare again—and it took a while to drag myself back out.

When I opened my eyes, they landed on the closed drawer beneath the coffee table.

My hand moved before I could think. I slid the drawer open, reached inside, and pulled out the pill bottles.

I'd never stolen anything in my life. The moment my fingers closed around one of them, my palms were instantly damp with sweat.

But I'd done my homework. I knew the dosage.

If I took half and left the rest for him—well, that'd be enough for both of us to disappear.

My thoughts were hazy. I told myself this was reasonable. Fair.

My fingers trembled as I unscrewed the cap of the first bottle.

Then, out of nowhere, the phone on the coffee table rang.

The sound tore through the silence like a gunshot.

I jumped, nearly dropping the bottle.

My heart thudded.

Guiltily, I set the pills down and grabbed the phone.

I hit ""Answer"" before realizing—it wasn't mine.

He must've forgotten it when he left.

The call connected.

And immediately, a furious voice exploded through the line.

""Listen to me, Nolan—over 200 million dollars! You really think you can walk away without giving me a dime? Not a chance!

""I might not have raised you, but I sure as hell gave birth to you!

""That little sister of yours died for you—and as your father, I have every right to inherit from a dying son!

""Donate it all? Keep dreaming!""

# Chapter 3

I hadn't meant to listen in on someone's private conversation.

But the voice on the other end of the line had been so loud, so agitated, and so fast that by the time I snapped out of it and hurried to hang up, I'd already heard more than I should have.

A slip of paper had fallen onto the carpet.

It must've come out when I'd fumbled with the drawer earlier, grabbing the pill bottles.

It was a diagnosis report—late-stage heart failure. The patient's name: Nolan Diaz.

The name struck a chord. It was the same one the man on the phone had been shouting about.

I thought for a moment before it came to me—something I'd seen trending not long ago.

Nolan, founder and CEO of Nolan Tech, had suddenly announced plans to sell the company, even though it was booming.

The timing made no sense. Selling now would mean taking a loss.

I remembered the news coverage—reporters swarming him, and him standing there with that same expression he wore now: calm, vacant, lifeless.

He'd said only one thing, ""I'm tired. I just want to rest.""

So it was him.

And the reason he wanted to die… was because he was dying.

Funny, how life worked.

Some people were perfectly healthy and still wanted to die. Others, even with everything going for them, got hit with a terminal diagnosis.

I picked up the paper carefully and tucked it back into the drawer with the pill bottles.

Stealing medication from someone with a terminal illness…

Even if I made it to hell, I'd probably still get spat on by the devil himself.

Outside, dusk was falling, and rain had started to fall in steady sheets.

It beat against the floor-to-ceiling windows, tapping louder and harder as the last traces of daylight disappeared.

Still no sign of him at the door.

He… didn't actually die out there, did he?

I sighed.

After a moment of internal debate, I stood up and stepped outside.

His car was still in the front yard. He must've left on foot.

And without his phone, he wouldn't have been able to call a ride—not until he got out of the neighborhood, anyway.

Maybe he hadn't gone far.

I grabbed an umbrella and headed out, walking through the rain and past the gates of the villa complex.

Then I hailed a cab and asked the driver to take me to the nearest mall.

Honestly, I doubted he was really out buying fish this late.

But I still wanted to look for him.

It was cold, and the mall was quieter than usual. Fewer people than normal.

I checked each floor, scanning every aisle, but didn't see him anywhere.

Just as I was about to give up and try a different mall—

A sharp, cold voice sounded behind me, ""Who told you to follow me here?""

Charley.

I turned around. He was standing not far away, face tight with irritation, staring straight at me.

Standing next to Charley was Elsie Palmer, the daughter of a CEO he'd recently partnered with on a big project.

He'd gone to close a business deal and conveniently picked up a new ""goddaughter"" along the way.

The CEO praised him endlessly—called him warm, generous, kind-hearted. But only I knew the truth. He'd never been the warm-hearted type.

He just didn't like me, his real sister.

It felt like my heart had been dropped in ice water—heavy, aching, and tight.

I'd spent years trying to get used to it.

The brother who used to dote on me, protect me, give in to my every whim...

Had turned into someone who couldn't look at me without disgust. Every word he spoke was sharp, cold, and full of contempt.

And yet, no matter how much time passed, I could never truly get used to it. Never really stop caring.

It took me a moment to push the feelings down.

I tightened my grip on the umbrella, forced myself to meet his eyes, and said as calmly as I could, ""I wasn't following you. I… came to find someone.""

His eyes darkened, voice full of suspicion and anger. ""You've never once come to this part of town.

""If you weren't tailing me, who else would you be looking for?""

Just as he said that, I spotted a familiar figure behind him.

I couldn't clearly remember Nolan's face. It was still a blur in my mind.

But a face that pale, that still, that dead-looking—there couldn't be another one like it.

He was standing at a distance. Not close, but not far either.

He didn't move forward. Just stood there, watching me.

Like he preferred it this way—keeping some space, quietly observing.

Charley frowned when I didn't respond and snapped again, ""I'm talking to you.

""Stop creeping around and following me. I'm not your brother. Get that through your head.""

Nolan stood there holding a plastic bag.

Through the clear plastic, I could see a cleaned, freshly prepared fish inside.

He'd actually bought it. After being gone for over three hours, he really came back—with the fish.

And just like that, a memory surfaced—uninvited.

Years ago, I'd thrown a fit late one night, begging Charley for cake from that bakery on the far side of town.

He'd scolded me, said eating sweets that late would rot my teeth.

Plus, it was way past closing time.

I sulked and went to bed angry. But in the middle of the night, he came back, cold all over, sneaking into my room so our parents wouldn't wake up.

He pulled the cake out from inside his coat—it was still warm.

And with a stern face, he told me, ""This is the last time.""

But somehow… there was always another ""last time.""

I snapped back to reality and looked at the fish again.

Then, unexpectedly, I let out a quiet laugh.

Charley stared at me like he'd just seen a ghost.

He followed my gaze, and when he turned to see Nolan standing there, his face twisted in shock and anger.

""Why the hell is that guy still here?""

I finally pulled my eyes away from the fish and gave him my answer.

""I didn't come for you. I came to find my brother.""",1,1752220322.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

My ex (H) 39M reached out to me this past Feb that his gf broke up and he offered me a greencard as a joke to Iceland. I was very much into the idea and open to reconnecting as we didn't break up on bad terms. Found out they broke up because he was on the computer too much , didn't give her the attention she needed, and she didn't like his household cleaning contributions.  H realized I had the same complaints and he completely stopped playing video games or using a computer.  They own a townhouse together, and his  convinced him at the time they could afford this even though H thought it was outside of their budget. They moved in and essentially he ended up paying for everything except the car they shared. He savings are minimal at this point. They have not had luck selling their townhouse as the market is awful, so he is stuck living with her until it is sold. One night they went to a friend's party and she had sex with his one of his friends. H spiraled mentally and became anxious and severely depressed. He started excessively walking 10-15 miles a day and not going to work. She also started playing mental games with him, especially if she knew he was talking to me (she knew becuase I am the only person he spoke English to). We got close but I knew this was not the time to pursue a relationship, he was not ready, and I have my own situationship/relationship that is relatively dead and needed to break off but that is another story. I had time off in June as I was trying to go to an inaugural flight to Greenland, the prices were too high and then it sold out. He suggested we go to Rome or Berlin ( I didn't want to go to Rome because he went there with his ex 2 years prior).  I decided Berlin would be great as it wasn't a super touristy area and I would be more focused on ""us"" and a laid back schedule than doing lots of touristy things. I also figured we could go to Hamburg and see the tank museum as I promised him I would with him from a prior trip- it would have been a perfect no stress trip. As we were looking to book flights, his phone overheated and he had to go on his laptop, which was the first time in months since the breakup.  He then cried and had a mental breakdown. I told him he wasn't ready for a trip and he agreed. We looked for pyschologists together and he reached out to some but they were fully booked with clients. He stopped going to work and became difficult to talk to. His workplace has a union and they found him a psychologist group for him to follow up with.  They are doing the union a favor and really squeeze him in every 2-3 weeks. H has a PTSD with a psych from childhood and doesn't say much during their sessions or he will cry not working much out. He saw the psych 2 times prior to this trip. My best friend at the time, S, found out H isn't going away with me and invited herself to join me but can only join 6 out of the 8 days. I look for the cheapest trip option at this time, used the travel anywhere feature, which happened to be Rome. Also during this time I encouraged H to reach out to S for guidance as she has been my rock for all my mental health issues or situations and is amazing at identifying/or asking great questioned.  H takes to S well and stated she is better at this than I. He then started messaging her regurlarly but I was always filled in by one of them, so I thought ? I didn't feel like a 3rd wheel or anything at the time. H did mention when he comes to the USA he wants to drive to S, since I never see her . He also talked about S a lot but nothing in a romantic way. S and I kindly invite H in case he changed his mind and he declined. I didn't start planning or booking yet as I just bought the plane tickets. Before I knew it H told me his mom is making him join the trip. I found out his mom had an ulterior motive which was she wanted to order something in the USA so I could bring it to Italy and then H can bring it to Iceland. I was disappointed that she was using us but not a big deal until it arrived- it was 10 lbs and too big for a carry on. His mom and I  decided H will come to USA and he can bring it back at a later time. 



As I am trying to plan  this trip, I ask for S and H's input, and didn't get much of a response. I knew that Rome would be very crowded in the summer and that it was the Jubilee, so I needed to have as much planned or booked to prevent disappointment and waiting in long lines. So I asked them many times if they were okay wtih what I found, etc.  I did receive feedback for  Pompei and this monastary. I figured since S isn't going to be there for the first 2 days, H and I can go on a tour or rent a car and go to the monastary  because it was difficult to find public transportation that didn't take over 3 hours to get there and it was only 1.5 hour drive from Rome. H declined my offer and stated he did not need to do it on this trip. H then stated S was also interested in seeing the monastary.  S sent me a link of the train that was only an hour but I explained to her that this was on top of a mountain and had a confusing bus route. I asked them both to look for it and was open again to renting a car for a day and I would drive as I had an internatioal driver's license. I did not want to walk it because I am mostly recovered from months of plantar fasciitis and was nervous to do any heavy hiking/walking. H also stated that he knew they would be miles ahead of me walking up this mountain.  H did find a tour later on but it was all day and visted many grave yards and  seemd to rush the monstary with only 2 hours to visit it. I offered for H to take a day to go or for S and H to take a day to go and they declined.  S wanted Pompei and found a 15 hour tour that had bad reviews and seemed rushed as well. S and I agreed to do Ostia Antica instead as it was closer to Rome and less touristy. S also agreed to add the beach to this to make it a nice full day trip and she is also obsessed with the beach.On top of these two places,  I am the only one booking this trip and they both agreed to a lot of the things I send. When booking for the Colosseum Attic- a competitive , almost impossible ticket to get, I was only able to snag 2 for one time slot at 0950 and 1 for the other slot of 1040. I initially made it for H and I and the other time slot for S. It did not matter when booking because I had up to 7 days prior to change the names. I asked them who wanted to go with me and I also said who would take the best pics of me. I didn't think I said anything wrong at this moment but apparently S was hurt I didn't ask who wanted to spend quality time with me, so the ticket situation remained how I booked it. They also agreed to 180$ ticket to breakfast at the Vatican. While planning, I made an detailed Google Map of all the food/cafe's/drinking/etc places that were recommended, and icon coded them. I shared the map with them and asked them where they would like for me to make dinner reservations. I received it doesn't matter or  IDK or we will find something. They did not care about my map and not interested in researching food places. I made reservations the first 2 days for H and I and left the rest up to them as it was already overwhelming to deal with. I made a google doc itinerary and begged S to look at it and didn't receive much feedback. I found out during the trip H never looked at it. 

On the flight, my feet swell. I am wearing my new Dr. Scholls sneakers that have stellar reviews for comfort, not needing to be broken in much, and also great for cobble stones. I  even had compression socks on to help avoid swelling but my foot is feeling tight in the sneaker. Once I arrived, I realized getting situated in Rome and starting my day that I planned, took a little longer than I anticipated, and I was only able to make it to the food places I reserved and not the 3 other places I wanted to walk to and explore. I also had a strict time limit from my Airbnb host to meet at 1600 and was repeatedly asked by them to not be late as they were checking in many people. I didn't worry as I figured I could move the 3 things to another day, it was no big deal. I met with H and we go to get my luggage and my feet are feeling tight in the toes and bothering me. I decided to wear my sandals from Reef to dinner not knowing they would rip my feet open on the sides. I could hardly walk on the first day. I persuaded for H to take the bus back with me instead of a taxi and we go to sleep. 

The next day I made plans for us to go to the park for most of the morning and a skeletal musuem with 3 food/drink reservations for the day. I made sure it was a chill day and not rushed. We end up sleeping in as we were both exhausted, this was probably H's first full night sleep since his breakdown, he was averaging 4-6 hours before so I knew this was a big deal for him. We made it to our 5 star hotel lunch reservation at a beautiful garden and genuinely had a great time together. We explored the garden after lunch and we realized it was too close to our dinner reservation time. The weather is awful, full sun, no breeze, instant dry mouth from excessive sweating, and instant layer of sweat once you were outside. We decided to rest for an hour or so and we would get up early the next day before S's arrival to do the park. I booked a Speak Easy bar, where H met me. He then asked why did I book this without S and made me feel horrible. I told him S doesn't really drink and this wasn't really her thing. He kept pushing on it for a bit and it made me uneasy. Also that night, H told me it was messed up that S would be checking into the apartment the next day and that I would not be there. S agreed prior that this that this was okay and I made her a video of how to check into the apartment so there would be no confusion. 

The next day I get up early and H wanted to sleep in, I get to the Trevi fountain around 0600 and it was packed, people in their Instagram clothes and children up to take portraits, I was shocked but took some photos and decided to go to the Pantheon and then the park I planned the day prior. S just landed and I knew she would be a while . I head to the park and the things I wanted to photograph were in recontruction or I could not find a way to walk to the place and time was passing quick. S made it to the apartment and H was there. I get back around 0930? and we were supposed to be at the Pantheon around 9. I tried buying tickets prior but the website rejected my credit card so it was okay we didn't get there by 9.  I figured we can fit the Pantheon in whenever as it was supposed to be a 5 minute stop. I get into the airbnb say hi and prepare to get ready. I believe they were talking and then stopped when I arrived. I asked what they wanted to do and received a whatever response, I decided to go to skeletal museum as it was closest to our AirBNB.  We get there and buy the tickets. S had to buy a cover up for her shoulders and seemed perturbed. The employee then handed her an audioguide and she rudely declined it and the employee kept trying to convince her it was a great thing to have, S begrudingly took it and looked unhappy for the museum part as did H. We finally reach the crept and we are all smiling. After a few hours we go to the Pantheon and  I see the line is long and asked to do the Mr 100 tiramisu instead as we could all eat at the time. We go and I think S is not happy but she saw the long lines. There is not much talking during this and it feels a little weird but I didn't think much at this time. I remember fishing for positive feedback that I planned this day and it is going well.  I remember H stating S's hand sanitizer smells better than mine, S stating my dog needs to go to daycare, S stating my dog is a pit, and I prob have PCOS- so negative comments is what I remember. I take them to a cool art museum for coffee and drinks and they seemed not as amused. I then take them up a hill and I see myself dragging behind with the pain and the heat, I never asked for them to wait for me but I can tell they are prob not so happy about it.  They don't see so amused by the view and we head for the pizza tour-S told us she would leave early that night as she had not slept in 2 days- she decided to walk back and we stayed for dinner and desert- S and I agreed to meet up at 5 am the next day to do the popular sites and photos- during dinner with H, my feet are in a lot of pain and I can't keep my shoes on. I already had moleskin on and blister glide but I was getting new blisters each day around the moleskin areas. 

The next day I woke up early, S is not up. I loudly bang on her door and she told me she overslept- somethiing that is very unsual for her, she is usually up first and early. I realized it was too close to 530 at this time and its too late to see the sites before the crowds- we agreed to get up for breakfast at 7 but I overslept until 9 something. She did not sleep and I think was angry at me. This was the colosseum attic day, H and I planned to take the metro to get there in time, but S wanted to walk. H then says to S she is really serious about beating him with her steps today, they laugh. S did not want to join us and we agreed to meet at the Colosseum. H and I are at the attic- I took my time with the pain to get up the stairs and we were taking pics of each other etc. S met us up there and she took photos of me and I offered to take of her but she was adamant about hating photos of herself. She did agree to photos of her back looking out into the colosseum. We finally leave the attic and go to the main floor, we decided to go to the 2nd floor to walk around and the museum area. Here S stated she already did all of this and could have left an hour ago, H chimed in and stated he did this already and was good to go. I have not done any of this section and stated they could go and I would meet up with them. They agreed to stay with me and were definitely miserable staying. After completing the second floor I decided I would come back to see the first floor when I was scheduled to see the underground later that week, it wasn't an issue. We get lunch and its hot and miserable, no breeze at all. It got awkward when S wanted me to order and pay for her sandwich and I refused. I told her I didn't want the bills to get too messy as I paid for everything and didn't want her to pay this part and I paid that part, wanted to keep it simple. I ordered for her and have her pay, Lunch is awkwardly silent except when H and S bond over the love of coca cola ? Then telling me I need a new curling iron because I burnt my finger that morning, and that my fingers were swollen and to take my rings off, otherwise not much convo. Next on the list was Roman Forum, It was a short walk in the dead heat and I had to stop every 5-10 mins. I definitely was complaining and miserable and felt awful.  We walked up a big hill to get there  and H decided he was going to go back to the airbnb and shower, it was too hot. I gave him my pastry from the morning and asked him to place it in the fridge and a few other things to bring back. I wanted to join him but I knew S would feel left out and would prob be mad if I left her, and she would not enjoy the Roman Forum without me. I stayed to placate her and not make her feel like the 3rd wheel. I took out a plastic bag as we were sitting on a hot wall that was burning my legs, I asked her to hold the bag for a second and she snapped saying no I am not holding your stuff. I stated i didn't know what she was talking about as I wasn't asking her to hold my stuff just to hold the bag for a second so i could position it a certain way, and she goes oh. I finally get up and we go down to the forum, I rebandage my feet and we walk halfway until I find a shady spot with a breeze. We sit for an hour, not much talking, and then S wanted to do Palatine Hill, I stated she had to go alone I couldn't do it and we met up 30 mins later. I wanted to look for new shoes at this time but I was afraid it would be too far from the cooking class and wanted to walk in that direction instead. I booked a cooking class, where they both agreed to come. After double checking for the 4th time S stated no and voiced she thought she would be the 3rd wheel as cooking classes were for couples. I told her before the trip it was supposed to be fun and not for couples. She refused to go until the class was moved to an earlier time that day. There was one other couple there that were laughing and genuinely having a great time together, us three were more on the quiet side and not as talkative. We made Aperols which was fine and then we paired off to make tiramisu. I offered for S to go with H so she would not feel like a 3rd wheel, but she refused and stayed with the instructor. After this we made pasta and we all kept to ourselves. I was struggling because i forgot a few of the directions. H was in his own world and S helped me but made it seem like I was a bother to her.  We all stood up and watched the instructor in trhe kitchen making our pasta sauce. I was standing in the front and S/H were standing in the back. I see H whispering to her and I figured he would tell me at some point but he never did. I beleive here is whereI started to feel like the third wheel. After the class I knew they both wanted to walk so I stated you two can walk and I will take the bus. I get back a lot quicker than them, showered and went to bed. They get back about 20 mins later and H told me how they were talking about how it was nice to walk their pace for once. I felt awful and took this to bed with me until the next day. H offered me water that he cooled down, I only got 2 small sips, and then I asked if he put my pastry away, he did not, said oh shit, ran out, thought he was putting my pastry away, no he went to S's room to give her the water. When I asked about the water he stated he gets half and S gets half. It was weird, he did not ask if I was done . 

The next morning, S and I wake up and go to the Trevi fountain for photos, we decided to go to the Spanish Steps after as it was a 10 min walk- I made it there fine but struggled to walk back with the pain and swelling, despite all my wrappings. I told S it was weird H talked about her all the time and she stated he talked about me all the time when he was with her.  That morning she asked me if she could put her towel in my bag and I stated I had a bag she could use. She then went nevermind ( this is the beach day). We finally make it back to the Airbnb and she started berating me about being on a Tylenol schedule and she was setting alarms. H joined in stating to remember this for when I tell him to take meds when he is sick. S is also trying to get me to take ibuprofen but I avoid it as much as possible due to my kidneys. I then find out S will not be swimming that day I planned for the beach and H joined her saying he is not swimming as well. I felt like the odd one out again and didn't understand why they both agreed to a beach day. I felt like the child swimming and they would be awkwardly watching me.  S also refused to take her towel as well as H. We head to the train station to go to Ostia Antica. After I help them buy their tickets S stated if you saw the sign on the machine I could have used my credit card at the turnstile. I asked her why she didn't tell me when I was buying the tickets and she went quiet. She then tried to tell me we were on the wrong platform and I had to say it nicely we were not as I took this train a few times and it was the right one, H agreed with me. We then get to the station where we had to switch tracks, I am the only one actively asking for directions and we all go to the right platform and figure out which train to wait for. While waiting for the trrain, they are each doing their own thing and I am sitting down. The train time is removed from the board and both accused me that it was the other train that just passed on the other side. I asked them to wait as that train had different destinations. S seemed annoyed. Our train came within a few minutes of it being removed from the board and it is full, I had to sit on the floor because I could not stand long. I tried. The train stopped a stop prior to ours  and we are all kicked off. I asked an employee how to get to the next stop and the guy said there were buses but there were 600 on the train and the buses take 50-60 at a time. I asked them if we could uber, S stated she was fine with the buses and H agreed. I stated that I might head back to the airbnb then because we had a timed ticket, it was getting close, and the bus situation was overwhelming with the big crowd. They then agreed to the uber, which was 7 euros a person, not bad in my opinion. We head to the site and the sun is in full blast, no shade, air is thick, and there are cobblestones, I can hardly walk so I told them to go walk around and enjoy I will lay by the beautiful flower patch. I finally get up and they see me, they only did a small amount of the park as they meandered to every nook and cranny. I stated I did not understand how this was all so interesting as it looked like piles of bricks and I felt like I could see this in a ghetto in Michigan or elsewhere.  H was not happy with my opinion and they both went to venture again. I followed them for a brief moment and they were genuinely happy. I saw a farm with  lots of shade and a nice breeze, I took my beach towel and laid it down, started to doze off and I received a message from H that they were done and ready to go. I told him I was not and  I was happy where I was and that they could do what they want, etc. He stated no. I messaged S and told her they could do what they want I was content. She then stated they would go to the cafe and meet me after. I kept trying to convince them to go off and do what they wanted. I meet them feeling great but stated to them I didn't understand why they didn't do their own thing, S barked back at me stating I was not clear enough, this triggered me . I stated that I didn't want to sound like a bitch to be clear and that I have to be one to clarify to her. We saw the train station was 12-15 mins away and I knew I would not be able to keep up with them and their pace. I told them I needed to sit down for 20 mins and they should head off to the station so I would not ruin their pace. I def was a bitch here- I will admit it and said it a little on the rude side. They left and I get the train after them. I buy myself Birkenstock sandals to see if this will help with my pain. S reached out to me to coordinate to meet up after, so I didn't think of anything being that bad. I realized I needed to have some alone time to process why I was reacting this way. I get back to the Airbnb and take a nap, they are both gone. I see H after I wake up and I asked if he wanted to get Indian food for dinner, this was a must on his list, even though we both told him we wanted Italian food only. He stated he ate dinner already. I then started getting ready and asked if they want to see the sunset at a special location that I missed earlier on. I told them I was not walking though and would take the bus, they agreed. I told them which bus stop to get off at.  When we approached the bus stop H gets off but we didn't because it did not match the google name. I messaged him and he headed up the hill.  S and I go up the other side. While walking up the hill a cluster of my blisters perforated. S and I agreed to get dinner after the sunset, since H ate already. S and I see that the keyhole is right on the top and only a 2-3 mins walk from H. I get in line with S at the keyhole- which is an Instagram view- I realized the line was slow, we would prob miss the sunset view,  and I didn't want S to get annoyed.  I felt like I was walking on eggshells with her when it came to this stuff. I then stated she should meet H if she didn't want to wait in the line. Before she left, she received pics from H of the sunset, I didn't think anything of it until I realized I didn't receive any of the photos. To me this was the icing on the cake and I realized I was the third wheel of the trip. I messaged S and told her this is getting weird and she stated ""I know what you mean"".I said I do not think you do and cancelled dinner with her that night. We agreed to meet tomorrow as I needed the night to clear my head and to not say stuff I would regret. 10-15 mins later H sends me the photos but I knew he only sent them because of S, he then came over but I was already crying profusely. I stated to him, actions spoke louder than words and that I should not be a third wheel on my own trip. I asked for him to go away I needed the night to clear my head. I stayed out until 2am, not one of them making sure I was okay. I thought about getting a hotel but feared it would stir more drama. I overslept that morning but messaged S around 0630 between snooze alarms that I would be ready soon, next thing I knew it was 9AM. H is up and I talk to him about how I am very hurt and feel like the 3rd wheel, feeling like an option instead of a priority. He snapped back and stated S was the third wheel and not me. He stated we were not romantic and he didn't have to treat me as a priority? something of that sort and then threw in about my situationship and how he was messaging me the second night. I told him the situationship would end I needed to do it on my terms and this was something H was aware with and was okay with the whole time. There were no secrets between us. He also stated S was prob going to leave to the US today. I knocked on S's door prior to this convo and messaged her, no response, her shoes were not outside the room, but her stuff was in the bathroom. I assumed she was upset and left to get breakfast. I asked H if he was joining me to Tivoli that day and he stated no. I didn't fight or ask for more and I left. I messaged S because I thought she was on her way to USA, she responded back that she overslept again- something was off, this girl never overslept but I just went with it. I finished up the villas late around 8PM- S asked me if I was joining them for dinner but I wouldn't be back at a decent hour, it was 1.5 hours from the city. I get back and they were both gone, they come back later than I. I spoke to S and she was okay, she only stated I am sorry you feel this way but I thought we made progress into the right direction. I asked for some boundaries with H and that was it. 



The next day we all get up and go to the Vatican, same dynamics but I shut my mouth, expressing how I felt didn't get me anywhere. We go back to the Airbnb and then out to the Jewish Ghetto where we all eat a slice of pie, big slices and filling. I told them I had one more place I wanted to go to and maybe I would see the Pantheon since they both saw it the day before (yes they had a whole day together). We are a few mins from the next place and H asked if I wanted to join him to Tibet island and get dinner, I told him I can't think about food I am so stuffed we just had pie. S also stated we just ate a large amount of pie but then stated she wanted to eat in 30 mins. I told her I am too stuffed and would not be hungry in 30 mins and that she should go with H for dinner. She went and I sent them the plans for the rooftop bar I had booked for that night. H stated he wasn't going he will go to bed early. S also stated she wasn't going to go. I cry, again the odd one out. They both didnt say anything when I mentioned it earlier and they both agreed to this place prior to the trip. S then stated she did not know when she will be in Italy again and will blow off the last day with us and go to Venice. She then decided to meet me at the rooftop bar. I asked H if he was also bailing on me the next day and he asked why would I think that. I stated that he seemed to follow whatever S did. He stated I intended to spend time with you on this trip.



At the rooftop bar,  I told her I felt like she threw a curve ball at me for leaving the trip early and I thought we spoken about it to clear the air. I called her out for being very withdrawn in the trip and not seeming happy. She stated she had a lot going on with work and her life and very stressed. She also came into the trip with a negative mindset as she stated that she told her sig other that if things were awkward she would come to the USA early.  She also told me she thought this trip would be too photo focused and pretty much had negative thoughts about this trip and did not tell me much about her thoughts prior. Also S knew I am an avid photographer and that I take lots of photos on my trips, even people who don't know me well know this about me. I also told her I never felt so hurt and cried so much on my trip, which she replied she also cried a lot when I left to Tivoli without her.  We realized we needed the day in Tivoli to catch up and spend time. She also told me she didn't come to see Rome, she came to spend time with me, but when I look back I don't see her trying to spend time with me. I saw her standoffish and not friendly/ more cold and withdrawn. We parted friendly but I think this is the end of the friendship. Maybe I was holding onto a friendship that wasn't there anymore . I come home to see H on his phone, not sleeping. I called him out for using his phone as an empty void and not addressing his problems. I then told him i don't think I should see him during my Greenlandic trip and he agreed. He stated something about loving me which I stated i do not think he does and that he is not ready for a relationship? I can't remember if he was jabbing at me or not about the relationship part. I told him I wasn't either and that was the end of that. 

 I said goodbye to S the next morning and she messaged me about her trip and how much she planned and liked the vibe better than Rome. I woke H up as we had a tour that they all were supposed to go to. He asked why am I getting him up so early , so I said he  could meet me. I get to the Vatican at 0730 ( our tour is at 820 and its a 45 min commute) and the lines were wrapping around the walls. I called H and told him this and he said told you so? I told him if he did not come on the tour he still had to pay me as I paid for it already. He said okay. I did not hear from him since, I even sent him all the tour info where to meet, etc. I cried more as I knew he bailed on me. I did not hear from him until the afternoon when he asked me to dinner. I told him I wasn't sure as I wasn't in the right headspace and he placed a heart on that. I finished my day plans and told him I wasn't joining him for dinner. He started focusing on cleaning the airbnb like I was his ex. I told him don't worry I will take care of it. He stated we can do it together later then with a smiley face. I went to the airbnb and moved my stuff into S's room. Him not showing up for the tour or that day to me showed me he made his decision to not choose me. He stated to me on the FB chat we could talk after I had dinner ( I decided to go out on my last night and have dinner, didn't have dinner the last 3 nights prior). I get back to shower and go to sleep, I felt like there was no point in talking as I tried two times prior. I was hurt and I was done crying. The next morning I woke him up to check my old room to see if I left anything behind. I then left without saying goodbye, he opened the door as I am locking it and says wait, then waves bye with a weird smile. I said bye and left with my head down/sad.  I left the group chat that all 3 of us were in, messaged S she won't hear from me much I have a lot to process and think about. Haven't heard from any of them. Not sure what to do. I am very hurt how this played out but we all went ot Rome for different reasons. I went to see Rome, S went to see me, and I am not sure about H, I think he went to make his ex jealous honestly. .

# Chapter 1 Pounds-For-Power System

Name: Tasha Newman

Age: 20

Weight: 240 lbs (chunked up from meds)

Height: 5'1""

IQ: 78 (brain fog from those pills)

Beauty Score: -30

Tasha blinked at the glowing screen that popped up out of thin air, her brain totally blank on what was happening.

Weighing in at a hefty 240 pounds, Tasha was built like a brick house. Her skin was splotchy and slick with oil, peppered with zits and weird bumps.

Her greasy hair flopped flat against her scalp, and the rolls around her neck wobbled with every breath.

Suddenly, a voice popped into her head.""Hey there, I'm System 103, your Pounds-for-Power System. Wanna trade some weight for brains, charm, height, or even a few extra years? If it's part of you, I can flip it for something awesome.""

The system, 103, gave its spiel and nudged her. ""Come on, host, let's make a deal. Pick something to trade.""

Tasha stared at the numbers, her brain finally clicking into gear. 'Holy crap, I just hit the freaking jackpot!'

""So that's why I'm such a dim bulb,"" she muttered. ""No wonder the director was always calling me a total doofus.""

System 103 cut her off, sounding like it was over her whining. ""Host,you're time-traveling, capisce? No directors here to rag on you. Now quit dawdling and trade something already.""

Tasha glanced at the panel, about to open her mouth—

""Hey, tubby! You zoning out or what?!""A loud yell snapped Tasha out of her daze.

Her body lurched before her brain caught up, and she stumbled out of the room, practically barreling into the living room, huffing like she'd run a marathon. ""Mom!""

SMACK!

A stinging slap landed across Tasha's chubby cheek. Her mom, Janice, glared at her like she was something gross stuck to the bottom of her shoe, wiping her hand on her shirt in disgust.

Tasha barely felt the burn, too stunned as she stared at her weirdly young-looking mom. ""Mom, what's your deal?""

""My deal?"" Janice snapped, her voice loud enough to rattle the windows. ""You got a brain the size of a peanut? I told you to watch the soup, and now the kitchen's practically up in flames!""

Tasha sniffed the air and caught a whiff of something burnt, but she'd bet her last dollar Janice never said a word about any soup.

Janice's eyes blazed at Tasha's clueless face. SMACK! Another slap connected. ""Useless! What the hell are you even good for?""

Tasha's cheeks stung, but her head was spinning harder. 'Why does Mom look so young? And this house—why is it such a dump?'

Janice wasn't done, her voice dripping with venom. ""I told you half an hour ago! You can't even remember that? No wonder you tanked the SATs! You're a walking embarrassment!""

'SATs?' Tasha's mind reeled. She could've sworn that was years ago.

Janice shoved her, but Tasha's bulk barely budged. ""Get lost! You're giving me a migraine. Your sister aces the test with over 1400, and you? Barely breaking 200. You're making me look bad!""

Tasha, built like a tank, didn't budge an inch, which only cranked up Janice's fury. ""I said scram! Show your face here again, and I'll whoop you silly!""

Then, that sour, rank sweat smell wafted off Tasha, hitting Janice like a punch. She gagged. ""God, you're a total slob! Dumb as a post, fine, but smelling like a dumpster?

""Don't you ever shower? You living in a pigsty or what?""

Tasha mumbled, eyes down. ""It's not like I don't wanna shower… Wesley's always hogging the tub. Then Hattie and Pansy take their turns… I just… never get a shot.""

Janice went nuclear. ""So you're a loser and you're blaming your little brother and sister? Useless! Get lost!""

She grabbed a broom and started swinging it at Tasha like she was chasing off a stray dog.

Tasha didn't quite get why everything felt so bizarre, but she wasn't about to stick around for a broom-beating. She bolted out the door.

Slumped on the curb, Tasha stared blankly at the giant digital clock on the building across the street.

Her heart skipped a beat—the date was ten years in the past.

It was evening now, and the street was buzzing with folks hustling by. Most gave her the side-eye, dodging the chubby girl zoned out on the sidewalk like she was bad news.

Finally, the system chimed in, sounding annoyed. ""Yo, host, you gonna pick something to trade or just sit there all day?""

Tasha snapped out of her fog. ""Trade what now?""

System 103 groaned, like it was explaining to a toddler. ""The Pounds-for-Power System, hello? Swap some weight for stats. You gotta start trading to unlock the main quest. I'm not here to babysit you.""

""Main quest? What's the deal with all this?"" Tasha squinted into thin air where the system's voice came from, her voice shaky and confused. ""Why the hell am I back ten years?""

The system, cold as a freezer and not big on warm fuzzies, shot back, ""Start trading, and you'll figure it out.""

Tasha wasn't exactly a genius, but she could take a hint. ""Alright, fine. Let's do this trade thing.""

The system perked up. ""Sweet, host! What's your pick? Height, smarts, good looks, muscles, extra years—whatcha want?""

Tasha went quiet, chewing it over.

The system figured she'd go for looks or height. Real talk—her current getup wasn't exactly turning heads.

But after a moment, Tasha piped up, ""I wanna be smarter.""

The system did a double-take. ""Say what? Why's that?""

Tasha shrugged, looking lost. ""Dunno. My brain's all fuzzy, and my memories are a jumbled mess, but—"" She paused, then muttered, ""I'm just so done with eating crap for being dumb.""

System 103 didn't dig deeper. ""Alright, brains it is. two pounds for one IQ point. How much you trading?""

Tasha, totally clueless about the numbers, threw out a wild guess. ""Uh… 220 pounds?""

The system went dead silent.

""Host, this is Pounds-for-Power, not Ashes-to-Ashes，""System 103 said.

Tasha blinked, confused. ""Huh? Who said anything about ashes?""

The system let out a mental facepalm. It was hitting it hard that Tasha's brain wasn't exactly catching its snarky jabs or clever metaphors.

Then it gently explained,""Okay, you're clocking in at 240 pounds. If you trade 220, you're down to, what, 20 pounds? You trying to whittle yourself down to just a head or something?""

Tasha got it this time, and her face fell like a bad soufflé. ""Oh… so that's the deal? Alright, just swap as much as I can. Turn it all into brain juice.""

System 103 let out a virtual sigh. ""Host, you can trade up to 120 pounds. That'll score you 60 IQ points. You down?""

""Only 60 points?"" Tasha groaned, totally bummed. ""Is that even gonna make me, like, smart?""

The system kept its cool, like it was chilling in an ice bath. ""Host, your IQ's 78 right now. Add 60, and you're at 138. Genius is 140 and up, just saying.""

Tasha's eyes, squished by her chubby cheeks, popped wide. ""Wait, what?""

""Look, after this swap, you'll be, like, this close to genius level.""

Tasha echoed, ""This close?""

The system dropped the poetic stuff. ""Yup. You'll be crazy smart. Smarter than most people walking around.""

Tasha's face lit up like a Fourth of July sparkler. ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

""Hold up, too many folks around. Can't let anyone peep this. Go find a bathroom.""

Tasha, always game, shuffled around until she found a nasty little public restroom. She crammed herself into a stall, her big frame barely squeezing in.

""Swap's starting.

""Three—

""Two—

""One.""

A quick shimmer, too faint to see, washed over her. Suddenly, her body felt like it was roasting—scary hot, like she'd been tossed in an oven.

Panic hit her like a freight train, followed by pain that burned like nobody's business.

""Ow! OW! OWWW!"" she yelped.

The system stayed frosty. ""No take-backs once it kicks off. Don't sweat it, you'll be fine.""

Tasha was drenched, sweating like she'd run a marathon, screaming her lungs out. But not once did she say ""quit.""

A minute later, her yells quieted down. Another minute, and it was dead silent.

System, chill as ever: ""Hey, Host, you good?""

No answer.

Tasha, soaked like she'd been hosed down, was panting hard. Then, bam—she shoved the stall door open and bolted to the mirror.

She stared at the woman staring back.

Nothing special—plain, tired-looking, the kind of face that blends into a crowd.

Her skin was still a bit dull, but that gross, greasy shine? History. The fatty lumps on her face had shriveled up, leaving just some loose skin hanging out.

Most folks wouldn't be jumping for joy over this look. But Tasha? She gawked, slapped a hand over her mouth, and burst into tears, hot streaks running down her face.

""Holy crap!"" she blurted, voice shaky.

The fat. That fat that had haunted her through two freaking lifetimes. The nightmare she could never ditch. Poof—gone.

She looked down. The rolls on her waist, belly, and thighs? History. Her stomach was flat, her legs toned. Her waist wasn't catwalk-ready, but ""chunky"" was no longer her vibe.

The kicker was the swap left zero trace. She'd been petrified she'd end up with a floppy, saggy mess of skin where the fat used to be.

But her body? It was tight, sleek, and normal.

""Host, how's it hangin'?"" the System asked, smooth as ever.

""Feels freakin' amazing,"" Tasha mumbled, like she was caught in the best dream ever. ""I've never felt this alive.""

No more huffing up stairs, catching shade from people whispering ""human bowling ball"" behind her back.

No more nights wincing as her heart groaned under her body's weight.

No more sweating buckets from a short walk, smelling like a gym bag left in the sun.

No more gasping for air just from bending over to grab something off the floor.

""Oh my God!"" Tasha burst out laughing, the sound wild and free, though tears soon glistened in her eyes.

""I remember now… I already kicked the bucket once,""she added.

That was her previous life.

She'd been crossing the street, keeping it chill.

She was in a slump but still followed the rules. The one who didn't? Some drunk jerk in a car, weaving through traffic like a maniac.

People scrambled out of the way, but Tasha, heavy and slow, couldn't move fast enough. She got launched skyward.

Right before everything faded, she heard someone snicker, ""Damn, she's so big she caved in the hood!""

She was toast. Then, somehow, she got a redo.

She was totally out of it, wandering around like a lost puppy. Somehow, she'd ended up back in her old house, no idea why, and completely thrown when Janice started yapping about her SATs. She'd moped around like a total loser for half a day until the Pounds-for-Power System flipped on like a lightbulb.

Suddenly, the world was sharp as a tack—like ditching a grainy old phone for a camera that could zoom in on the meaning of life. She felt like she could see right through the BS of the world.

""Host, what's the plan? Heading home?"" the System asked.

Tasha shot a glance at the mirror, shook her head, and said with a fire in her voice, ""Hell no.""

It all came crashing back. Every damn moment.

The days of being pushed around, not a drop of kindness in sight. The days of being mocked, treated like a punching bag or a errand girl.

To her parents, she was dead weight. To her siblings, she was a clown, a nobody.

That place? It wasn't home. Not even close.

Tasha shoved the bathroom door open but paused. ""System, we good? No cameras creeping around?""

""Relax, Host. No cameras, no busybodies,"" the System replied.

Tasha let out a big breath and stepped into the open.

She looked average, maybe even a bit rough. But inside, her heart was electric, pulsing with a confidence, clarity, and freedom she'd never known.

'New world, buckle up—I'm coming through,' she thought.

# Chapter 2 Old Life, Fresh Start

Tasha popped open her wallet and nearly dropped it—a crisp twenty and a fifty were just chilling there. Seventy bucks, out of the blue.

Her parents, Janice and Orson, wouldn't give her a nickel for pocket money. Meanwhile, her little brother Wesley, still in middle school, was drowning in 170 bucks a month. Her younger sisters, Hattie and Pancy, each scored 70. Tasha? Zip. Zero. Nada.

Then it clicked. This moment was straight out of her last life. Around this time, Hattie had nailed her SATs, making the family look like superstars. Orson, plastered at some bar, had bragged about booking a fancy hotel for a huge party. When he sobered up, he bailed on that plan and decided to just throw a dinner at home.

This seventy bucks? Grocery money Orson had tossed her way for the feast. Too bad for him, Tasha had just poofed back into her current body and completely forgot his orders.

She shoved the cash in her pocket without a second thought. Even better, her ID was still tucked in the wallet, probably left there post-exams.

No reason to drag herself back to that dead-end shop job now.

This seventy bucks? Her launchpad for a new life.

After slaving away at that shop for two lifetimes and getting peanuts, walking away with just 70 bucks felt like she was some kinda saint.

Her clothes were baggy, gross, and reeked of old sweat. Tasha hit the wholesale market, dropping 26 dollars on new underwear, a t-shirt, shorts, and some bargain-bin flip-flops. She haggled like a pro, driving the vendor nuts until he tossed in a pack of loud, colorful hair ties just to get rid of her.

New gear in hand, Tasha zipped to the bathhouse. She spent seven dollars on a towel, soap, and a toothbrush kit, then another seven scrubbing herself raw, like she was washing away her old life.

Dressed and fresh, she felt like a whole new person. Downside? Her wallet was down to 30 bucks.

System 103 had been watching the whole time. As Tasha slipped into her new outfit, it piped up.""Hey, host, why not trade some of that extra weight for more cash?""

Tasha raised an eyebrow. ""Didn't you say weight's only good for boosting my stats? Cash doesn't exactly fit the bill.""

""Just checking if your new brain's firing on all cylinders,"" System 103 said, sounding like it dodged a bullet. ""Guess it is.""

""You're such a goof,"" Tasha said, rolling her eyes.

She ditched her old clothes in a trash bin and headed to the train station, dropping 13 bucks on a ticket to Ironwood. While waiting, she grabbed a bottle of water and a bag of massive dinner rolls.

The train rolled in.

The car was a hot, crowded mess. Tasha's cheap hard-seat ticket stuck her between two big guys, practically squishing her into a human sandwich.

By lunchtime, the air was thick with the stench of humburgs, BO, smelly feet, and random takeout. Total barf-fest.

Tasha didn't care. She wolfed down four giant rolls, washing them down with water.

The guy next to her stared, jaw on the floor. This average-looking girl can put away food like nobody's business.

Between bites, Tasha pinged System 103 in her head.""Hey, system, you got any knockout sleep tricks up your sleeve?""

""Yeah, we do,"" System 103 said. ""Free, even. But it's kinda dicey.""

""Dicey how?"" Tasha asked.

""It's, like, lights-out sleep. You're gone until the timer's up. No amount of shaking's gonna wake you.""

In other words, passing out that hard in a packed train car wasn't exactly safe.

Tasha just shrugged. ""Whatever. Someone gonna rob me for my looks? I'm no model. My cash? I've got, like, seventeen bucks left.""

Her ""screw it, I'm over it"" vibe left System 103 at a loss. After a beat, it said, ""Alright, fine. How long you wanna crash?""

Tasha let out a huge yawn. ""Train's got four hours left. Let's do four.""

System 103 made it happen.

A tidal wave of sleepiness slammed Tasha, her eyelids heavy as bricks. She didn't even get another word out before she was out cold.

The train car stayed loud—clanking, chatter, snores—but Tasha didn't so much as twitch.

She sank into a long, vivid dream.

Forced sleep wasn't supposed to let you dream, but Tasha did anyway. It wasn't just a dream—it was her old life, playing out like a movie in her mind.

In her old life, Tasha was the kid everyone picked on.

At barely 5 feet tall and pushing 220 pounds, she looked like a walking beach ball. Growing up, she was a total loner—no friends, no playmates. Her family acted like she was invisible, her relatives threw shade, and her classmates? They never let up with the jokes. It wasn't until high school that Tasha thought she'd struck gold with her first real pal, Nicole Meyer.

Nicole was a knockout: pretty, kind, loaded, and the girl every guy in school had a crush on. But looking back, Tasha saw their ""friendship"" for what it was—barely a thing. Nicole didn't have her back when the mean kids came around, but she didn't join the dogpile either.

That tiny bit of not-being-awful was enough for Tasha to latch on like Nicole was her lifeline.

By some crazy stroke of luck, Tasha tripped into showbiz, landing gigs as the funny fat girl or the punchline in some goofy scene. Then she got wind that Nicole had jumped into the game too.

Tasha was pumped. She slid into Nicole's DMs right away, and just like that, they were ""besties"" again. The tabloids couldn't get enough, hyping them up as Tinseltown's cutest sister act.

Tasha wasn't exactly a natural star, but she worked her tail off. She threw herself into every ridiculous role, hamming it up like nobody's business. The showbiz's drowning in pretty faces, but someone like Tasha—willing to lean into the goofy, no-ego shtick? That was gold.

Bit by bit, she carved out her spot. Yeah, she was still the chubby girl who didn't fit the mold, but the jobs kept coming. Pretty soon, her name was ringing bells louder than Nicole's.

Then, like the universe decided to toss her a high-five, Spud Giggles came calling.

Yup, the Spud Giggles—the comedy crew that churns out hit after hit, launching stand-up legends and raking in billions at the box office.

And they wanted Tasha to play the supporting female lead in their next big flick.

This wasn't just a gig; it was a whole new level. No more bit parts or throwaway roles as ""Random Goon."" This was Tasha's big break, her shot at being a legit comedy actress with her name in lights.

She was losing her mind with excitement. First thing she did? Video-call Nicole. She was a mess—laughing, crying, tripping over her words as she spilled the tea.

Looking back, Tasha couldn't believe she was so clueless. 'How'd I not catch that sketchy look in Nicole's eyes? What made me think me and her were even playing the same game?'

Tasha had the invite locked in, but she wasn't skipping that audition. Her name wasn't exactly dazzling the whole industry yet. The day before her big shot, Nicole hit her up, practically begging her to crash their high school reunion.

High school wasn't Tasha's jam—too many bad memories. Still, Nicole wouldn't quit, and Tasha didn't want to be a jerk and bail. So, she threw on her best dress, half to show off. No way was she letting those snobs think she was still a nobody.

Big mistake. What happened next was a nightmare she'd never shake.

Her old ""pals"" had gone all out, splicing every cringey, dumb, or straight-up embarrassing moment from her acting gigs into a slick video. They splashed it across the hotel's massive screen for everyone to gawk at.

Worse, they'd dug up goofy pig clips online, cutting them next to Tasha's scenes. Her curvy frame beside those hogs? Yeah, it made her look like she was starring in Piggy: The Sequel.

The soundtrack was that viral ""Oink Oink Jig"" blasting through the ballroom.

Nicole's boyfriend, Carl Lambert, was the evil genius behind it. He stood up front, clapping. When Tasha and a pig did a ridiculous mid-air spin in sync onscreen, Carl lost it, practically rolling on the floor. Nicole stood there, giggling behind her hand, the other smacking his back like he was a comedy king.

Tasha's head was spinning. The room wobbled, her heart pounding in her ears. She'd worn her best dress, the kind you save up for, and now she was their clown. It was like the universe was laughing, screaming that her last ten years—her hustle, her friendships, her life—were one big joke.

Nicole's sweet smile was still there, but her eyes? Was she mocking her? Pitying her? Tasha couldn't tell.

Then she saw him in the corner.

Still perfect, still cold, still untouchable. Time hadn't touched him.

He sat there, blank-faced, watching the chaos like it was a bad reality show. Their eyes met for a second.

His gaze was empty—no pity, no smirk, nothing. Tasha, the humiliating circus—it didn't faze him. He was like some king on a throne, sneering at the jesters.

That look broke her. The pride she'd clung to, the happy mask she'd worn—it all crumbled. A raw, guttural cry tore out of her, like a wounded animal, and she bolted from the ritzy hotel, stumbling into the street.

A flashy sports car screamed out of nowhere. The drunk driver behind the wheel sent her flying.

Tasha's ghost drifted through the world, glaring at the driver who hit her as he forked over 170 thousand dollars to her parents. The guy played it slick, pinning it all on her—claimed she blew through a red light, causing the crash. That money? Labeled ""charity,"" not guilt. Her folks had to sign a paper saying Tasha was fully to blame. Her mom and dad, who never really clicked with their eldest, didn't hesitate. Cash in hand, they signed that waiver quicker than one'd rip off a sheet of toilet paper.

Tasha's death popped off online for a hot second before some influencer's outfit and juicy dating drama stole the show. A few sketchy blogs reposted her story, tossing out half-baked RIPs while preaching about crosswalks and stoplights.

Her funeral was quiet as a ghost town—barely anyone showed up. Her family was there, snacking and rummaging through Tasha's things. Her brother Wesley griped, ""She was grinding in showbiz for years, and this is all she's got? Barely enough for a decent plot!""

Nicole swung by, though. She chatted up the family, then stood by Tasha's casket, squeezing out a few tears. Her photographer circled, snapping pics and muttering, ""More sad vibes, babe, but keep it Insta-perfect—this is tomorrow's viral post.""

And that was how Tasha's story fizzled out in her old life.

\*\*\*\*\*

Ironwood, New Cascadia's dazzling film and TV capital, is the beating heart of the region's entertainment scene. It was where dream-chasers flock to the studios, grinding it out for that one shot to go from nobody to red-carpet royalty.

System 103 bet Tasha would sprint straight for the studios. Nope. Fresh off the train, she wandered down a quiet pedestrian street and slipped into a rundown little bookstore.

The place looked like it hadn't been touched since the '80s—faded sign, peeling paint, zero customers.

In half a second, System 103 scoped it out. Shabby or not, the shelves were stacked: fresh bestsellers mixed with rare used books. Only downside? The whole place smelled like a musty attic, thanks to an owner who clearly wasn't big on cleaning.

Said owner, a sweet old lady with chunky glasses, was napping in a creaky chair, oblivious to Tasha's arrival.

The system caught Tasha's expression when she saw the old woman—a wild mix of sadness, joy, and nostalgia.

'Humans and their emotional rollercoasters,' System 103 thought.

Tasha stepped up and tapped the counter.

""Hm?"" The old lady jolted awake. ""Oh, hey, kid! Lookin' for a book? Grab whatever.""

""Not shopping,"" Tasha said with a grin. ""Ma'am, you hiring?""

\*\*\*\*\*

Half an hour later, System 103 piped up, ""Host, you and the book lady knew each other in your last life, right?""

""Caught that, huh?"" Tasha was now strolling through the studio district, soaking in the vibe. ""You've got some serious street smarts.""

""Knew it the second you hit that bookstore. Wanna spill? What's the deal?""

Tasha's face softened, like she was flipping through a mental scrapbook. ""Her name's Polly Mills. ""Last time, I didn't leave home till way later.

""Same as now, though, I was flat broke. Got lost in the city and crashed into her bookstore.

""Polly let me stay with her for a month till I landed my first extra gig in the studios.""

""When I got my first paycheck, I tried to pay her back.

""She wasn't having it. Said, 'Kid, everyone hits hard times. You're a broke actor—hang onto your cash. Pay me back when you're a big deal.'""

Tasha's eyes fluttered shut for a moment. After a pause, she went on, ""I never forgot that. Years later, when I'd finally made a name for myself, I came back.

""But Polly's shop? Gone.

""I asked around, but the old neighbors had split. Took forever, but a food truck guy down the street filled me in.

""Polly got sick—cancer. Her son and daughter-in-law wouldn't pay for treatment. A gem like her, just left to waste away.""

""After she was gone, the bookstore got sold.

Tasha opened her eyes. That was the story's end.

In her old life, Polly was one of the few who gave Tasha a bit of warmth. She was the first friendly face in this strange city.

But life's no storybook. Good people didn't always win, while heartless types—like Polly's family—rode Tasha's coattails, cashing in on her old-life success without deserving a dime.

""Gotcha,"" the system said, clearly not getting human emotions but sensing Tasha's funk. It paused, then mumbled, ""Uh, host, sorry for your loss.""

'That's what people say, right?' it thought.

""Pfft!"" Tasha snorted, laughing. ""Loss? Chill, Polly's doing great. This time, I'm making sure she doesn't get the same raw deal.""

She'd already linked up with Polly early, and Polly had opened her door sooner than before.

Just now, they'd worked out a plan. Tasha could crash at the bookstore. Polly would run things during the day; Tasha would hold down the fort after 8 p.m.

No salary, but Polly would cover meals. Free food and a roof? Not bad at all.

Tasha was cool with it. Polly's bookstore wasn't exactly a goldmine, and foot traffic was slow. Taking Tasha in wasn't about needing help—it was just Polly's big heart.

With her living situation sorted, Tasha headed to the film studio. First stop: the Screen Actors Guild.

She dropped three bucks for an actor's permit. Thank goodness it wasn't a few years later—back then, getting one would've been a hassle. One'd need ID, a bank card, and even a code to join some group chat. Tasha would've been lost without a phone.

System 103's deep sleep feature was no joke. Even on a train, Tasha slept better than she ever had in both lives. She felt sharp, light, and ready to take on the world.

Stretching with a yawn, Tasha suddenly remembered something.""Hey, System, what's my status right now?""

The system pulled up her stats.

Name: Tasha Newman

Age: 20

Weight: 112 lbs

Height: 5'1""

IQ: 138 (Excellent)

Beauty Score: 0 (Just another face)

Health: 41 (Not great)

Strength: 0

Charisma: 0

Losing 120 pounds worked magic on Tasha's vibe, even without cashing in for a beauty upgrade. Her charm score climbed from the negatives to at least zero, and she was totally hyped about it.

System 103 cut in, ""Host, your health was at 30 before. Post-weight loss? It's 41 now.""

Talk about a steal—drop pounds, boost health, and look sharper? Tasha was sold.

She skimmed her stats and spotted new numbers. ""Wait, what? These weren't here yesterday,"" she said, squinting.

System 103 didn't hold back. ""'Cause your brain wasn't ready to get these numbers yesterday.""

""Well, rude.""

Fresh from snagging her actor's permit, Tasha wandered the film studio lot. Sure, she'd napped hard and her body was way lighter now, but exhaustion hit fast.

Yawning like crazy, she trudged back to the bookstore.

Polly's shop was on a laid-back street near the studios, so Tasha was there in a flash.

Inside, Polly was chilling behind the counter, peering through chunky reading glasses at a book. She looked up with a grin. ""Hey, you're back! Saved you some eats.""

Tasha eyed the spread: a couple of flaky biscuits, a bowl of creamy mac and cheese with a golden breadcrumb topping, and a mug of warm chocolate milk. Classic diner vibes, no doubt—probably zapped in the microwave just for her.

She froze, imagining Polly hustling next door, charming the socks off the diner folks for that chocolate milk, then coaxing the owner to heat up the grub.

The thought hit hard—not from this life, but her old one.

Polly's bookstore was barely scraping by. Her pension was decent, but her leech of a son took most of it. 'She is stretched thin, so why is she doing this for me?' she thought bitterly.

Polly's smile was all warmth. ""Good to see ya, kid. I'm off. Eat while it's hot.""

She nodded to the back. ""Got you some bedding from my place. It's in the storage room. Eat and crash.""

Tasha mumbled, ""Thanks, Polly.""

Polly shuffled out with her cane, grinning.

Tasha didn't follow, watching Polly's wobbly figure fade.

She knew Polly's house was close, where she lived with her son and his wife. The pension kept her safe from grief, but respect? Not so much.

If Tasha walked her home and the chatty daughter-in-law saw, it'd spark drama for Polly. No way Tasha was risking that.

She sank into a chair, grabbed a biscuit, and bit in. Soft, warm, buttery—perfect. She chewed slowly, head down.

Then System 103 saw it: a wet spot on the fluffy biscuit.

""Polly,"" Tasha whispered, mid-bite, ""I'm gonna make it big. I'm gonna stack cash—tons of it.""

# Chapter 3 Getting Crammed With Smarts

Tasha scarfed down all the biscuits and mac and cheese, then guzzled the chocolate milk.

Done eating, she swiped her mouth, stacked the dishes, and grabbed her bargain-bin toiletry kit.

The bookstore's bathroom was a cramped little nook—just a toilet and sink—but it was clean enough. Tasha washed up, brushed her teeth, and trudged to the storeroom.

Yup, same old bedding.

There it was: a faded blue-and-white floral bedspread with a lumpy feather pillow, like something straight out of a dusty old farmhouse. The blanket was so worn the edges were practically transparent, but it was clean, with a faint mothball vibe.

Tasha knew this set—it was Polly and her late husband's from their country days. The pattern was pure grandma-chic, and the cotton was stiff as a board.

This worn-out bedding was the only reason Polly's tightfisted daughter-in-law let it end up in the bookstore.

Tasha spread it out quietly. The blanket was heavy, the cotton packed so tight it felt like a plank. Old, sure, but it had been the good stuff once.

The storeroom was a shoebox, stuffed with books that made it feel like the walls were closing in. Tasha's bedroll was crammed into the only clear spot—a narrow strip between towering book stacks. One wrong roll, and she'd knock over a pile.

This wasn't a bedroom; it was a glorified storage bin. A single, dim bulb overhead gave off a sickly yellow glow that barely lit the place.

Tasha set up her makeshift bed. Just when the system thought she'd crash, she spun around and headed back to the bookstore.

She scanned the shelves, then yanked out a Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

The system were left speechless.'Uh… seriously?'

Tasha plopped into Polly's chair, cracked open the dictionary, and started reading from word one.

In her previous life, Tasha's brain was a sieve—everything she studied slipped right through. When she got a bit of fame, internet trolls had a blast, dubbing her a ""illiterate celebrity.""

But now, she was packing a genius-level IQ of 138. Thing was, she knew it was all potential, no substance. She had to start from scratch and fill that brain up.

The system was low-key impressed by her grit but had to ask, ""Host, it's super late. Not gonna hit the hay?""

Outside, streetlights glowed, but the pedestrian mall was dead quiet.

""Nah, I'm good. Got you to keep me company, right?"" Tasha said, eyes locked on the page.

The system shut up.

Tasha flipped through the dictionary, and man, her mind was a steel trap.

Every word stuck like it was glued there. She closed her eyes and could see each word—page, line, everything. This was straight-up photographic memory.

And her reading speed? Insane. She was blazing through ten lines at a glance. Dictionaries are boring as heck, but after tearing through a fifth of it, Tasha checked the bookstore's clock.

Just an hour and a half had passed.

At this rate, she'd rip through the whole thing—maybe even memorize it—in under eight hours flat.

Tasha's mind was blown. Four more hours in, it was one a.m. She'd blasted through most of the book. Her head throbbed like a bad hangover, and her eyes stung like she'd been chopping onions, but she was hooked, gobbling up every word.

She'd never felt so pumped. It was like her brain, this big ol' empty space, was finally getting crammed with smarts, shoving out all the old clueless vibes.

No way was she sliding back to her old life. She was gonna suck up every ounce of knowledge she could.

Finally, the system butted in, ""Hey, Host, your health's down to 38. You're not just 'off'—you're one gust away from toppling over.""

Tasha's voice was all scratchy. ""One more hour.""

By two a.m., her vision was fuzzing out, little black dots buzzing like gnats. She had to pump the brakes on her reading spree.

Her stomach was roaring, but there was no food in sight. She snagged a water bottle, filled it from the store's dispenser, and chugged it like a champ.

Her head felt ready to explode, and her heart was racing like it was in a sprint. Wobbling like a tipsy toddler, she stumbled to the storage room and crashed onto her floor mat.

""Forced sleep mode,"" Tasha muttered. ""Wake me at six.""

The system was about to roll when Tasha added, ""Hold up.""

""What now, Host?""the system asked.

""How much do I weigh? I wanna cash in.""

""115 pounds. You can trade 4 max.""

""I'll trade—"" Tasha yawned, barely keeping her eyes open.

""Host, your health's in the toilet. It might screw with your tasks. Maybe—""

""Beauty points. All four pounds,"" Tasha snapped, cutting it off.

Beauty points were the last thing she needed. But, come on, no one would say no to a glow-up. The system didn't argue and made the swap.

A slight warmth hit Tasha, but compared to her first trade, it was nothing—barely a tingle. She figured the heat depended on how much weight you swapped. Noted.

She was dying to check her new look, but sleep was screaming her name.

The system killed the lights with some techy trick and zapped her into dreamland.

The system killed the lights with some techy trick and zapped her into dreamland.

Same old Tasha stared back. Same sallow skin, same plain-Jane face. She leaned in, squinting.

Then she spotted it—her acne scars were maybe a tiny bit lighter.

'Seriously? Two beauty points for that?' She shrugged. 'Whatever, it's a start,' she told herself, keeping it chill.

Tasha stepped out of the bathroom, still rubbing a towel through her damp hair, and found Polly already at the bookstore counter, skimming the morning paper with a coffee in hand.

""Hey, Tasha, you're alive!"" Polly teased, nudging her reading glasses up with a grin.

The old lady was practically a walking ray of sunshine, always brightening up the dusty little shop.

""Morning, Polly,"" Tasha replied with a polite nod, her lips twitching into a smile.

Polly's eyes twinkled. ""Man, I slept like a rock last night. Used to stress about some lowlife breaking in after hours, but with you around, I'm sleeping easy.""

Tasha gave a half-smirk. She knew Polly was just tossing her a bone. The bookstore's heavy-duty shutter could fend off a tank—nobody was sneaking in, Tasha or not.

Reading her like an open book, Polly leaned in. ""Plus, you being here means I can ditch early and go play doting grandma with my grandkids. Before you showed up, I was stuck here 'til ten o'clock.""

That much was legit. From eight to ten at night, the film studio crowd spilled onto the street, turning the pedestrian mall into a zoo. It was prime time for the bookstore, and shutting down early would be like throwing money out the window.

Tasha's face softened, a real smile breaking through. ""Happy to help you out.""

Polly jerked her chin toward the counter. ""Breakfast's up. Grab it.""

Two burgers and a steaming mug of milk sat waiting. Tasha's stomach was screaming—she was starved. No time for pleasantries, she snatched a burger and demolished it in three bites, standing right there.

1lx0z7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lx0z7l/chosen_by_dragon_kings_novel_when_i_was_a_child/,"Chosen By Dragon Kings Novel_ When I was a child, my grandmother used to tell me stories of the Chosen One.","When I was a child, my grandmother used to tell me stories of the Chosen One. At the time, I never gave them much thought. Thinking they were just that… stories. Growing up, I soon realized that they weren’t lofty fantasies and fairy tales, but memories of her past, memories of our ancestors before our world turned to shit.

When the uprising happened twelve years ago, all Fae creatures fought alongside the elves and the angels trying to right the wrongs of our ancestors from the great war, trying to restore the balance back to where it was meant to be.

My parents were among those who fought bravely. I was nine at the time. My grandmother hid me in the bunker under our house, promising to watch over me if they didn’t return.

Only when we came back up, the world had changed, and so did my life. My parents were gone. Not a single person who fought in the war survived. No Elves, no Fae, no Angels. Even the humans were mostly wiped out, including the Oracle. Her death was the biggest blow because with it, we lost not only lives, but our magic.

I was part of a dying species. There were hardly any Fae left. A few hid, but we tried our best to keep to the shadows, trying to go unnoticed. I had never met another Fae other than my grandmother, yet I refused to believe we are the only ones left.

We were on the bottom of the food chain now, next to humans. Ruled over by the Dragon Kingdom.

The Dragon Kingdom was different from any before it, and those that ruled were merciless and cruel. No one was allowed in or out without their say so.

I have never left the city, forced to hide amongst those that live here, hoping that we remain unnoticed. Because being Fae was a death sentence.

At the top of the food chain were the Dragons, then the Lycans and Vampires. We used to be next before the Elves and the Pixies, then the Mermaids. Right at the bottom were humans.

Now we were right beside them, the scavengers of the world, taking what was left after the rest discarded what they didn’t want. Fae without magic might as well have been human. We look like humans except our eyes, each unique to our bloodline. Mine were the color of amethyst, like my mother’s bloodline.

My bloodline was all but eradicated. We used to be among one of the largest Fae families, helping to rule among our kind. My bloodline was royalty, now gone, just like our ancestors, leaving only me and my grandmother.

My grandmother said our bloodline used to be among the royal Fae, that our ancestors achieved great things. Now I was the last one of our bloodline and possibly the second last Fae. Once I go, that’s it. The survival of my bloodline rests entirely upon my shoulders.

Yep, the future didn’t look great for my family, soon to be snuffed out of existence.

My twenty-first birthday was coming up. I had been dreading this day for as long as I could remember, the day when they would hunt me down and drag me to the castle. There weren’t many job opportunities for Fae, just like the humans.

Fae were now nothing but a distant memory people refuse to believe existed, so we disguise ourselves by blending in with the humans. Most humans were sold into the sex trade or into slavery, unless, of course, you were caught and proven to be Fae.

Then you only earned the right to die painfully for the sins of your ancestors. That is why no Fae exists. That is why my grandmother and I keep to the shadows, blending in with the humans, so we remain unnoticed.

Turning twenty-one was a significant day for Fae creatures. It is the day when our magic is supposed to manifest. No Fae have been found since the uprising, at least not that I know of. It’s believed when we lost the war, then the Oracle it angered the fates, and they shunned the Fae stripping us of our magic. The ancestors turned their backs on all of us.

My grandmother told me it was to try to stop the extinction of our kind, yet I believe they just gave up on all of us.

These days, Dragons and vampires summon all humans on their birthdays. Humans would line up and stand before the rulers, who would ultimately decide their fate. If you showed any magical ability, they killed you instantly, whether or not you were Fae.

In one week, they would summon me. My grandmother and I have remained hidden in the hopes I go unnoticed. My grandmother refused, point blank, to let them find me. She could not imagine me being sold off to the highest bidder.

Yet, deep down, I knew she was powerless to stop them. Sure, she had power, the only Fae on earth with ancient magic still flowing through her veins. The magic that had kept us alive. Yet her magic was slowly dwindling. It would eventually die out. Then, we would truly face our demise.

My grandmother coughs as she comes up behind me, pulling me from my thoughts. She grabs my hand, making me look at her. Her pale face holds a knowing look, like she knew what I was thinking. I never doubted her ability to read people. She often knew me better than I knew myself.

“What are you thinking, my child?” she asks, her eyes softening as she looks at me.

“Nothing grandma, but I will go get something for that cough. It has lasted too long,” I say worriedly. I can’t afford to lose her too. She was all I had left in this world. My grandmother shook her head, but I stood up, not taking no for an answer.

“Here take this,” she said, pulling her wedding band from her withered old finger, it slipped off easily, much too big for her frail finger. The ring was one of her most prized possessions, with intricate vines wrapping around the band.

“I won’t allow you to sell any more of your mother’s things for me.” I hold the gold band in my hand. It was another family heirloom that was given to her by her late husband, my pop. Passed down from his mother. I close my hand before dropping it into the pocket of my jeans.

“I will be as quick as possible, grandma. Try and stay warm,” I tell her, trying to put her mind at ease.

I grab my coat, throwing it on as I walk outside. The snow is sinking into my holey shoes, making my toes go numb.

We wanted to leave the city, but the Dragon lords refused to let anyone leave. Guards are stationed at every checkpoint, and in our opinion, it wasn’t worth the risk.

But being a Fae in the city was hard. I struggled finding work because I couldn’t remain in one place for too long; anyone looking too hard would be able to tell I was Fae. My grandmother, who was unable to use magic to disguise herself, could not work either.

So, my options were scavenging and bartering or being forced to steal.

Walking up the muddy streets, I retrieve my contact lenses and pop them in, instantly turning my eyes to a mud brown. I hate wearing them, my vision was enhanced being Fae, and I could see every line on the thin film irritating my vision.

Rounding the corner onto the next street, I glance up to see the dirty wooden sign that indicated I had arrived at the pharmacist.

The man that worked there was a nice human, and since money was scarce here, he would allow me to barter for what I needed, gold being one the hardest-to-come-by currencies yet also the most valuable.

I drop my gaze and start walking, trying to blend into the crowds of people. Making my way into the derelict store, I remove my hood, letting my black hair cascade down my back like a veil.

Victor, the store owner, looks up. A smile plays on his lips when he sees me. He always liked my grandmother. They used to be friends before everything went to shit.

“Elora dear, how is your grandmother?” he asks.

“Not good, Victor. The cough hasn’t gone away. She is getting worse,” I tell him, retrieving my grandmother’s wedding band from my pocket.

I drop it on the counter, shooting him a knowing look. He snatches it, placing it in his pocket, and nods his head before ducking out the back and bringing back a bottle of liquid. Victor knows what my grandmother is, yet he never mentions it, knowing it is a death sentence if anyone heard him speak of the Fae.

“Give her this three times a day; I haven’t got anything stronger. Herbs are becoming harder to find, especially in the winter.” I nod before grabbing the bottle and placing my hood back over my head.

“Elora stay safe out there,” he warns, following behind me, getting ready to barricade himself in before those that go bump in the night come out to play.

Bowing my head against prying eyes, I take off for home, running. When I reach the corner, I run into someone.

I mutter “Sorry” at them before I go to take off, only for them to grab my arm, ripping me in front of them. His grip on my arm is tight but also warm as I feel his heat seep into my skin through the jacket.

“Take the hood off,” a man’s deep voice commands. I try to free myself of his grip, yet he is stronger.

He yanks my hood off, revealing my black hair. I continue averting my eyes. My heart skips a beat when I hear his voice again.

“Look at me, girl,” the voice grumbles.

I shake my head, trying yet again to wriggle out of his grip. He grabs my face, forcing my eyes to look into his.

My eyes dart to his gold reptilian eyes, fear clear on my faces.

This man is Dragon!

**Chapter 2**

Dragons stood taller than any other supernatural creature in the city, they also had this air around them that told you they were a predator. Their godlike appearances made it blatantly obvious what they are.

However, only three Dragons resided in this city. The dragon lords ruled, and the city was their playground and they only allowed us to merely exist here.

Another strange fact about Dragons was no female dragons had been born since the war, making the Dragon lords angry, fuelling their hate for the Fae. They too were a dying species.

Although immortal, most have spent their lives alone or chose to take another male as a mate. I had seen the Dragon lords from afar, but never got close enough to actually meet one and I prayed I never would.

There are three lords and rumors circulated through the city that when they couldn’t find their mates, they chose to mate each other, hoping to keep themselves strong enough to rule over the kingdom.

Sometimes people would be forced into the castle, never to be seen again. That was particularly true for any woman to pass through those gates.

Dragons were insatiable and impulsive, usually taking a woman before killing her, it didn’t matter what species or status they held, no one survived them once they stepped through those iron gates.

That's the kind of crisis I was facing right now. I was afraid of this Dragon would take me because I didn’t follow his command.

I hear him growl lowly; it rumbles through his chest, his eyes flicker dangerously, eyes that weren’t human, his tan skin is warm even through my parka.

I barely reached the middle of his chest. His hair was dark, almost black in color but longer on top, he looked like he hadn’t shaved for a couple of days, stubble lining his face, his features were sharp, high cheekbones and nice full lips, he looked like a woman’s wet dream. Yet his aura was intimidating, his grip on me unrelenting.

“What are you?” he demands.

One thing I hated about being Fae was our inability to lie. We could beat around the bush but couldn’t answer a direct question dishonestly. I press my lips into a tight line, fighting the urge to answer as I stare wide eyed at the man.

A fight between two homeless people breaks out up the street, distracting him for a second. I don’t waste any time before ripping my parka off and sliding my arms out, escaping his clutches.

I hear a mighty roar and know he is chasing after me. I keep running, refusing to look back.

When I see houses lined up along the street, I dart through their yards, jumping fence after fence and finally losing him.

Desperate, I continue to run until I find our house, bursting through the door and slamming it shut behind me. My heart was pounding in my chest so hard I could hear its erratic rhythm. That was close, too close.

“Elora dear, is that you?” I hear my grandma say before she breaks out into a violent coughing fit. I make my way to her; she is still in the kitchen sitting at the table. She smiles softly before noticing my jacket is missing.

“What happened?” she asks breathlessly. Worry making her thin brows furrow.

“I ran into a Dragon,” I say, my voice shaking. “He chased me, but I think I lost him.”

My grandmother frowns in mild panic and starts coughing again. I race to her side, looking on helplessly as the coughing fit racks her slight frame.

“I lost the medicine grandma; it was in the jacket. I will have to try again tomorrow,” I tell her, tears welling in my eyes.

“It is okay dear, what matters is you are safe now,” she murmurs, though I can sense the fear of me nearly being caught worrying her. Her hands tremble slightly on the table as her nails tap with worry.

The night goes quickly. We were asleep when we heard the voices of people out in the street screaming. I jolt upright, paralysed with fear. Walking over to the window, I pull the curtain back and peer out, seeing men with torches, some in human form, others not.

They were ripping people into the street, going from door to door. I see a man in armour go to the house next door to us before I hear the shrill sound of a woman screaming as she is dragged into the street, her family looking on helplessly as she is dragged by her hair.

My blood runs cold hearing her begging and pleading with them as they drag her from her house. The entire street is in chaos. I run over to the couch where my grandmother is sleeping, only she too is now wide awake and looking alert having heard the cries of everyone on the street.

“Grandma get up we need to leave. They are going door to door,” I whisper, slipping my holey boots on my feet and quickly doing the laces. Slipping my contacts in, I hear more screams coming from outside and people fighting.

“Come on, grandma get up,” I tell her, pulling on her arm. She shakes her head before pulling a small knife from the coffee table drawer into her lap. She looks up at me with a sad look on her face.

“Run, Elora. I won’t allow them to know. I will only slow you down. You need to leave without me,” she whispers. I looked at her, panicked. What is she talking about?

“No grandma, come on. We need to leave now,” I tell her, trying to get her to her feet. She shakes me off and shakes her head.

“I promised to keep you safe. I can’t if you don’t go now.”

“What are you talking about, grandma? Promised who?”

“Remember the stories, Elora. You need to remember the stories. Now run.”

“No, I am not leaving without you.” I tell her, feeling tears running down my face. Before someone bangs on the door so hard, I thought it was going to smash off its hinges.

“Please grandma, we have to go.”

“I love you, Elora,” my grandma whispers before raising the knife and slashing her own throat. I scream and clutch at her neck, trying to stem the bleeding.

“Run,” she gurgles out. Just as they kicked the door in, my hands coated in her blood. Adrenaline kicks in, and I take off out the back door, through the criss-crossed streets of the city.

I can hear a soft sobbing only to realize it was coming from me as hot tears run down my cheeks at what my grandmother just did. The images forever burnt into my memory.

I clamp my hand over my mouth, trying to stop the noises I am making, my breathing erratic. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. Looking over the dumpster, I duck back down behind the dumpster when I hear a man call out, pointing in my direction.

“You there! Stop!” I don’t listen; instead, I take off running. I run to the end of the alleyway to find it is blocked off by a building and a brick wall making it dead-end.

Hearing someone crying behind the dumpster, I look down only to notice a little girl dressed in rags. I pull the ladder down and reach my hand down to her.

“Where is your mother?” I ask, peering down at her tear-stained face.

“They took her,” she sobs.

Without hesitating, I hoist her up so she can climb, and together we race upwards toward the roof. But not fast enough for the vampire chasing us.

A strong hand grips my ankle, ripping me back down to the ground. I fall painfully on top of a man, my head smacking the ground with a loud thud as I bite into my tongue. Another man retrieves the girl, and I hear her scream before a loud SMACK comes from him slapping her on the face.

Her dirty matted blonde hair is all I see as her head whips to the side, blood trickling from her lip and the sound of flesh on flesh echoing down the alleyway.

“Leave her, she is just a child!” I scream. The little human girl, who appears to be maybe nine years old, escapes the man and runs behind me, hiding against my back.

A tall man with black armour walks over his hair down to shoulders and a huge scar across his face, his crimson eyes reflecting oddly as he stares at us.

A Vampire.

**Chapter 3**

Chapter 3

“Hurry up, bring them to the castle with the rest of them,” he yells to the other men. The man who caught me grabs my hair, the roots painfully tearing from my skull as my head is yanked back.

“Move,” he screams in my face. I obey, following the Vampire man dressed in black armour. The little girl hangs onto the back of my shirt.

When we get to the main street, I find a huge line of women being herded to the castle. They shove us in the line behind more women, all sobbing as they had been ripped out of their beds in the middle of the night and torn away from their families.

When we finally walk through the high castle gates, I find the group of women all separated into rows. A man I recognize to be a Dragon standing at the front, watching everyone be dragged in and lined up. I am in one of the middle rows.

When I see his eyes dart over the crowd, I quickly duck my head down, hoping he didn’t notice me staring. Another man walks along the first line looking at each person and grips their faces looking at their eyes. He then dismisses them, and another man marches them back out the iron gates once they have been cleared and declared not to be whomever they were looking for.

I make sure to keep my head down to avoid making eye contact.

However, a deep husky voice comes above my head. “Look at me,” I can feel his eye penetrating into me.

I flinch away from the anger in his words. He grabs my hair, pulling my head back. I close my eyes breathing through the pain searing through my skull as I feel my hair being ripped out.

“I said look at me,” he growls again. I slowly raise my head to be met with the same hypnotic gold snake eyes of the man I ran into on the street. He scrutinizes my face before letting my hair go. My eyes instantly snap back to the ground.

“Remove them,” he says, his voice daring me to disobey.

“What?” I whisper, confused.

“The contact lenses; remove them now.” I shake my head in a pleading sort of way, knowing if I do, I will be killed instantly.

“Remove them or I will,” he grumbles, grabbing my arm. I whimper at his rough voice echoing into the darkness, making me shiver. I slowly lift my fingers, and one by one, I took out the contact lenses to reveal my sparkling violet eyes . He grabs my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his.

I hear everyone gasp before I hear the murmur of whispers throughout the crowd.

“Fae.”

“She is a Fae.” Everyone’s eyes on mine, which I know are glowing fluorescently into the night. Burning brightly like an amethyst beacon.

“Silence,” the man yells out to the crowd. The chatter instantly died down at his words.

“I knew I sensed a Fae when you bumped into me.” His lips were next to my ear, his cool breath sending shivers down my spine as he moves closer. He leans in inhaling my scent and I can feel his lips barely touching the skin in the crook of my neck.

“You’re coming with me,” he whispers, grabbing me and pulling me towards the old sandstone castle. It was huge, and something right out of a fairy tale, only dark and covered in snow, the vines growing along the sides looked like snakes, dying from the cold and the sandstone high walls tarnished from not being maintained properly.

I struggle, trying to free myself from his grip. He looks to one of the guards that we pass.

“Kill the rest,” he commands, and chaos ensues. All the women’s voices start screaming, echoing through the night at his words. Fear so pungent I could smell and taste it, as the guards moved closer, circling around and trapping them, and leaving them nowhere to run.

“No please, they didn’t do anything,” I begged as I fought against him. He stops and looks down at me and I cower away from his gaze, knowing I shouldn’t speak out of turn, especially to a Dragon king.

He grabs my face, making me look at him.

“Please, I will do anything you want, just don’t hurt them,” I beg. Tears roll down my face as I glance at the women behind me, begging for their lives. All staring at me, fear in their eyes as all the guards freeze waiting for his answer. His thumb rubs over my bottom lip, and a smirk forms on his lips.

“Anything?” he asks, his thumb pulling on my bottom lip softly. My eyes move back to the crowd behind him, before looking down at the little girl still clinging onto my shirt.

The fear in their eyes makes a tear slip from mine, all begging me to agree with whatever it is he wants from me.

“Yes, anything,” I whisper, feeling defeated. He smiles, and I can see all his perfectly straight pearly white teeth gleaming back at me.

I study his face. He has an evil glint in his eye, like he is looking at his prey. Nice full lips and high cheekbones with a firm jaw. He looks like the reincarnation of a god, built strong and beautiful, only I know he is the devil in disguise.

“Let them go,” he commands, raising his voice, his eyes not leaving mine. I shudder at the thought of being alone with this big brooding man. I hear the little girl sob beside me, which makes the man focus his gaze on her.

Pushing her behind me with my hand, his eyes snap back to mine, a devious smile playing on his lips.

“She is coming too,” he says, not leaving any room for argument, not that I would dare argue back. I hear everyone running out of the castle gates before he changes his mind. Before I hear the metal gates shut loudly, the steel groans as the lock slips into place.

He tugs my arm, pulling me toward the castle. Torches are lit along the path as we walk toward it. The only light coming from the lanterns next to the huge heavy double doors leading inside the castle.

He walks down a hall before leading us up some stairs. My feet make noises on the stone steps as we climb them. He pulls me to a door and opens it, swinging it open to reveal a room. A huge four-poster bed sits in the middle with black gauze hanging from the top.

He lets me go, leaving me standing in the middle of the room in front of another fireplace that is taller than me. The warmth is a welcome relief after spending hours in the cold. However, I feel more terrified than ever. He folds his arms over his bulging, muscular chest.

Another man enters the room, his skin the color of mocha, with dark onyx eyes. His chest is bare, revealing his muscular body and abs that look like they are carved from stone, a deep v-line disappearing into the waistband of his pants.

He smiles when he walks in, noticing me. I can tell he isn’t a Dragon but Lycan, which leaves me confused. Only the Dragon Kings live in the castle with their slaves, so why was this man standing beside a Dragon?

“You found her,” says the Lycan; his voice is silky and deep with a slight accent I do not recognize. He smiles, revealing his sharp teeth. As his eyes look me up and down.

I take a step back, feeling my heart thumping faster in my chest. He steps forward, crossing his arms across his chest. Both of them are standing over me.

“Strip,” says the Dragon King. I shake my head, not wanting to remove my clothes in front of their watchful, lust-filled eyes.

**Chapter 4**

“I said strip,” he repeats, raising an eyebrow at me, daring me to disobey.

I struggle to remove my shirt, trying to cover my bare chest by turning away from him. The girl beside me starts to remove her clothes as well.

“Not you, child. I don’t want to see you naked; you’re only here to make sure she obeys orders,” he says, making me relieved as she pulls her dress strap back up.

I remove my pants, leaving me only in my panties. Using my hands, I cover my breasts before turning around to face them.

The Lycan man steps forward, he licks his lips approvingly making me flinch. “Remove them,” he says looking down at my panties.

“Please,” I beg, not wanting to remove them.

“Remove them or I kill the child,” he says tauntingly. I look at the little girl who darted behind me at his words. I feel my cheeks burn with embarrassment.

This was so degrading and humiliating.

I pull my panties down before placing one hand over my breasts and the other trying to cover my lady parts. Both men step forward and I step back, nearly tripping over the girl behind me.

The Lycan man grabs my wrist, pulling my arm away from my chest, my ample breasts on display for them. I feel a tear run down my cheek as the other man removes my hand from my sensitive parts.

“Why are you crying? You have nothing to be embarrassed about,” says the Dragon. How didn’t they understand how degrading this is? No one should have to be put through this humiliation. I had never been naked in front of anyone besides my grandmother.

“Open your legs,” he growls, stepping closer. The Lycan man peers around me.

“Close your eyes little one,” he whispers to the small girl, and I feel a sob leave my lips. When the girl does as she is told, he stands upright.

He taps my foot with his, forcing my legs apart. His fingers move to my slit before he shoves his finger inside me quickly before removing it. I cry out at the sudden intrusion.

“A virgin like I thought,” he murmurs. I watch horrified as he sucks the finger into his mouth and moans loudly.

“You made me strip to see if I was a virgin? What, asking was too hard?” I ask but instantly regret it as they both step closer.

“You can put your clothes back on,” he says. The Dragon bent down and picked up my shoes. He looks at them before tossing them in the fireplace. I quickly get dressed.

“Follow us, we will take you to your chambers,” the Lycan man says. We follow silently. The Lycan leads the way while the Dragon remains behind us. I can feel his eyes boring into my back, feel the little girl’s arms grip my hips tightly.

We stop outside a door on the bottom floor, he opens the door and reveals a small room with a single bed and small fireplace.

I watch mesmerised as the Dragon man walks in and over to the fireplace, he takes a breath in then blows it out of his mouth like he's blowing a kiss. Yet I can feel the heat in the air rising rapidly as the logs start burning catching alight. He turns and winks at me.

I notice off to the side is a bathroom with a shower and toilet. I don’t move though, too scared by the men standing in front of me, I don’t want to risk angering them.

“You will stay here for now until Silas comes back and verifies you are who we think you are,” says the Lycan man, his eyes burning oddly mirroring the flames coming from the fireplace.

“If you need anything knock on the door, someone will hear you. My name is Matitus, this is Dragus,” says the man I recognize to be a Dragon. I store their names to memory, hoping I never have to utter them.

They then walk out, closing the door behind them. The little girl tugs at my shirt making me look down at her.

“Are they going to kill us?” she asks, concerned. Now that they are gone, I can really look at her. The poor girl is underweight, not that that is something unheard of in the city, starvation being the main killer.

“I don’t think so, well I don’t think they will kill you anyway,” I tell her. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, and an old woman who I believe is a human walks in with her head down carrying towels and a pile of clothes. Yet something seemed off about her, I just couldn’t put my finger on why I felt that way.

“For you,” she mutters, her eyes never peering up. She thrusts them forward again and I grab them from her before she hurriedly walks back out. I can sense her fear, like she was told not to talk to linger too long.

It would also make sense why she didn’t look up and make eye contact. She then shuts the door and I hear the jingle of keys and I know she locked it. I place the clothes on the bed along with the towels.

“What is your name?” I ask the little girl who comes and stands beside me. “Lilith” she whispers, looking at the pile.

“My name is Elora,” I tell her.

“Elora?” she repeats, trying out my name and making me smile. I dig through the clothes and take Lilith to the shower.

After that, we sit in front of the fire for a while and eventually fall asleep.

I am jolted awake when I hear the door swing open, creaking loudly. Matitus, one of the Dragon Kings, is standing in the doorway. I sit up, groggy before recognition hits me and I become anxious.

Dropping my gaze to the floor. My long black hair falling to my sides creating a veil. I see his boots come into my line of vision. He then kneels in front of me and grips my chin, bringing my gaze to meet his own.

“Why aren’t you sleeping on the bed?” he asks curiously.

“We fell asleep,” I tell him. I watch as he cocked his head to the side examining my face carefully before he lets go of my chin. I see Dragus walk in behind him carrying a tray with what smells like chicken soup. He sets the tray on the desk.

“Get on the bed,” Dragus says, making me glance at him. I feel sick suddenly, my blood running cold at his words. He seems to notice what he said before putting his hands up in mock surrender.

“Not in that way, take the girl with you,” he says, looking down at Lilith laying on the floor. I place my hand on her back, shaking her softly. Her eyes open before she jolts upright leaning against me in fear as she tries to get as far away from them as possible. I stand up to suddenly feel the cut on my back reopen and tear.

I grimace, feeling warm blood running down my spine, but I ignore it. Instead picking up Lilith and placing her so she is sitting on the edge of the bed.

I go to sit beside her, when I feel hot fingers move across my shoulder brushing my hair out of the way before lightly tracing the mark running from my left shoulder down to my right hip. I flinch slightly as it stings. I can feel the singlet sticking to the blood as his fingers run over it.

“Silas won’t like that” I hear Dragus mutter as I sit next to Lilith on the bed. Dragus then brings the tray over, sitting it between us both. Lilith looks at me unsure and I nod my head telling her it’s okay.

She must be starving, and when she finishes her piece of bread, I give her mine before turning to look at the two men standing in the room. They are both still watching me with indecipherable expressions on their faces.

“What is your name?” Matitus asks. Instead of answering I fight the urge and ask a question of my own, trying to avoid giving them my name. I know if they ask again, I won’t be able to help but answer them.

“What do you want with me?” They seem taken aback by my question and I have a feeling no one who has stepped in this castle has ever spoken out of line, let alone asked them a question as to their intentions.

“Your name?” Matitus asks his tone telling me to answer or else. I shiver as the urge to answer honestly takes over; I try to fight against it, sweat beading on my neck. Trying to ignore a direct question is painful to a Fae, telling a lie is almost impossible. One of the things I hate about being Fae. Matitus steps closer his hand cupping my cheek.

“Fae can’t lie or help but to answer. Why are you fighting against answering me?”

I shake my head and his fingers stroke my cheek softly, I grit my teeth trying to fight the urge to answer. “Elora” I stammer out breathlessly.

“Good girl,” he says, letting go of my face and stepping back.

“Why didn’t you want to answer?” he asks, cocking his head to the side. I see Dragus also watching me intently, his face holding some emotion, I don’t recognize. Was it awe? Wonder? I don’t know but it made me uncomfortable. I grit my teeth at his question not wanting to answer, but I know the words will come out anyway.

“Elora Aziza.” My words spew out of me in a rush.

“You’re from a royal bloodline?” Matitus steps back, recognition shining in his eyes, and he looks to Dragus.",1,1752220116.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

For the past few weeks hes been acting really weird around me and making me super uncomfortable.

It started small. He would always offer to walk me to my car after work even though I never asked. When I said no thanks he would say things like “A pretty girl like you shouldnt be walking alone.” I tried to be polite and just said I was fine but he kept insisting.

Then he started bringing me coffee every morning without me asking. When I told him he didnt need to do that he said “I just want to take care of you.” That made me feel really weird but I didnt want to cause drama at work.

The worst part was last week. I was working late and most people had gone home. Tom came over to my desk and started rubbing my shoulders without asking. I immediately moved away and told him not to touch me. He said “Sorry I was just trying to help you relax.” I was so uncomfortable that I packed up and left right away.

After that I started avoiding him as much as possible. I would take different routes to avoid his desk and eat lunch at different times. But he started texting me on my work phone asking why I was being distant and if he did something wrong.

Yesterday he cornered me in the break room and said we needed to talk. He told me he could tell I was upset and that he just wanted to be friends. When I said his behavior made me uncomfortable he got defensive and said he was just being nice and that I was overreacting.

I told him I needed space and to please leave me alone. He said fine but seemed really angry about it. Later that day he sent me a long text saying he was hurt that I would think badly of him and that he never meant to make me uncomfortable.

I ended up blocking his number because I was tired of dealing with it. Now some of my coworkers are saying I was too harsh and that hes a nice guy who just doesnt understand boundaries. They think I should have talked to him more before cutting him off.

But I tried to set boundaries and he kept pushing them. The shoulder rubbing thing really crossed a line for me. I shouldnt have to explain to a grown man that you dont touch people without permission.

It annoys me that she doesn’t share when she’s introducing my baby to new people, especially people that I don’t even know. She’s doing us a favor by watching our daughter for us, but the frustration of not fully trusting where she is going is starting to weigh on me.

1lx0nbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lx0nbt/its_now_getting_weird/,It's now getting weird.,"So, my living room has a massive window facing my back garden. Last summer I used to go out there when it was dark and enjoy the fact is was a little bit cooler outside then it would've been in the day. But that all changed when I started to get this really off feeling.

I started going outside drinking my coffee when I began to feel off, maybe as If someone was watching me but it was like my gut was telling me to go back inside. And eventually I did. 

Later on last year around winter, my sister her ex boyfriend and my brother were sitting in the living room. I was asleep upstairs, but they all said that last night really late they heard right outside the living room window as if one of our plant pots got kicked over and then suddenly a light flashed through our window like a flashlight kinda light.

Ever since then weird stuff has been going on in our garden like random noises and just that general off feeling etc.

But last night made me question if something is generally in our garden and I'm not just paranoid due to my mind wondering ahead of the actual situation. 

Last night around 10 maybe 11pm I was laying on my sofa, in Britain right now were getting heatwaves etc so the window of my living room was open slightly and I was scrolling my phone. I began hearing like a tapping noise just below my living room window.

I began to freak out a little trying to call my friend but calming myself down. I got up to close the window on instinct incase anything does happen and as I did on the ground it looked as if someone was either crouching on lying on the ground and had turnt some sort of light off as I closed the window.

I instantly closed and locked the window rushing to my back door to lock it. After I'd calmed down I decided to make a coffee. I was reaching down trying to get a certain cup but keeping my eye on the dining room window which you could see from the kitchen and also faced the back garden.

As I kept looking Over I saw a small light about my head height walk as if a human was holding the light to out of view from the window. That's when I freaked out and ran up the stairs to my brothers room.

(This brother isn't the one who was with my sister and her ex bf) but anyways, I knocked on his room door and explained what I saw he told me to grab the flashlight and he grabbed his and we went into my garden. We checked everywhere. Nothing. No sign of anyone nothing out of place literally nothing. My brother said that it was probably something reflective in the garden so i brushed it off. He checked the car in the front garden and then we went back inside he locked the back door and I began making my coffee again.

I sat on my sofa in my living room with my coffee just scrolling through stuff. Then my sister called I picked up we started talking I explained what I saw she sort of brushed it off and then I went to turn the TV off as I got up I saw the ps4 light reflecting on the window so I suddenly perked up thinking oh its just that. But then a small bit of light flashed again in the garden.

And this morning I was really thinking and for something to be reflective you need to put light to it. No lights were aimed towards my garden until me and my brother grabbed torches.

If anyone has any idea what this could be if I am overthinking it or not please tell me.

Its really starting to freak me out.",2,1752218779.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1lx0mkq,https://i.redd.it/vlnc793s57cf1.jpeg,Experience of charging in UK using Ionity,"I’m in the middle of a longish trip in Uk traveling to from the Kent coast to North Wales and back. About 400 miles each way. Overall an absolute breeze in the Q6 although the charging fees are higher than Audi advertise.

I charged to 100% at home before leaving and stayed with some friends near Banbury overnight. 185miles, 20% battery left although spent hours in terrible M25 traffic which helped with range. Granny-charged overnight.

Next day we stopped at Ionity Stafford. Fantastic experience: 15% to 95% in about 20 minutes. There’s a Starbucks alongside so we grabbed a coffee.

We stopped again at Ionity Wrexham. Topped up to 95% in the time it took to eat a Big Arch (McDonalds nearby). There are picnic benches by the chargers.

Charging was super-simple: plug and charge worked perfectly. The fees are displayed in the MyAudi app straight away and I received invoices by email a little later.

As others have said, long journeys are very straightforward with such fast charging.

My only slight gripe is that the Audi web site continues to state that the Audi Charge Pro rate is £0.43 / kWh, however this seems to have changed and is now £0.53 / kWh - a significant increase.

So I've decided to move everything I was originally gonna keep in *that* post to this one.

Part 4B (Tea Set Part 2: Metaphorical Tea Minigame Guide - Coming Soon)

Part 5 (Fleshing Out the Journalist + Yamada Family - Coming Soon)

Just for a quick rundown of Shiori's task, it involves Ayano getting a tea set from one of the zen gardens and bringing it to her, and as a reward she gives Ayano an extra instructions pamphlet she had accidentally printed, which lets Ayano unlock the ability to use the tea set any time after that outside of class time. Since the panty mechanics don't exist in my rewrite's metaphorical game, I decided that this would be one of the options offered to replace the panty buff mechanic. Since we're on the topic of the panty mechanic being replaced, here's a list of the pan-teas *(i'll see myself out)* I would add as a replacement!

*List of Panty-Replacement Teas (god that sounds so wrong) + Descriptions:*

Plain White Panties -> Black Tea: No boosts, mainly there for socialization and Kokuma Jutsu's tea-reading task.

*Description: ""Sometimes malty, sometimes fruity, sometimes floral, sometimes earthy- a well-loved classic that can vary in taste from brand to brand. Nothing special, really.""*

Low Leg Panties -> Ginkgo Tea: Doubles Ayano's study points for the day by boosting her focus in class.

*Description: ""A mild, earthy, bitter tea that can put any student in the right mood to study!""*

Girly Pink Panties -> Rose Tea: Puts Ayano in the right mood to boost her compliments and the efficiency of her matchmaking advice. Also temporarily increases her Seduction stat by half a level for the rest of the day.

*Description: ""Delicate, floral, and subtle- just the kind of tea to make anyone feel a bit romantic!""*

Skimpy Sexy Panties -> Yerba Mate: Gives Ayano a boost of energy (and bitterness) that makes her gossip more biting and effective.

*Description: ""Bitter, earthy, and smoky- the coffee of the tea world, perfect for when your attitude needs that extra kick. Rumored to taste sweeter the more you drink it.""*

Old-Fashioned Fundoshi -> Traditional Matcha: The bitterness makes Ayano more alert, meaning she'll be able to keep a body from bleeding on the floor as much and thus make blood pools smaller.

*Description: ""A vegetal, grassy drink for the old souls out there yearning for a taste of the past. Traditionally ground into a powder and whisked with hot water for a frothy, vibrant green beverage.""*

Sweet Strawberry Panties -> Black Milk Boba Tea (comes as a kit from the grocery store instead of teabags or tins like the rest do): One of the most popular drinks around Akademi, it gives Ayano a better idea of what her classmates are like and makes socializing with them easier and more effective. (Also, let's face it, putting strawberry tea here would've been lazy af 💀)

*Description: ""A trendy drink with too many variations to count, but far and away the most popular flavor is the one in this kit! This tea is sweet, creamy, and silky thanks to the milk and sugar, but don't drink too much or you might get a cavity!""*

Stealthy Black Panties -> Peppermint Tea: Makes Ayano more alert than her classmates, giving her more time to act before they become suspicious (in short it makes her classmates' range of sight shorter).

*Description: ""Fresh, crisp, and cooling peppermint combined with hot water serves to for a simple but legendary classic! Mind the aroma- it's a strong one!""*

Cute Kitty Panties -> Children's Tea [(like this kind)](https://boulderteaco.com/collections/for-kids/products/childrens-tea-strawberry-lemon-twist-4-oz-11-50): Makes Ayano seem more childish than normal, making other students assume she's just in a bubbly mood today and therefore make them more forgiving since (in most cases) they don't want to ruin her day.

*Description: ""With how fruity and sweet this tea is, it's no wonder that kids love it! Don't worry about being judged for drinking it- it has marigolds in it, which must mean it's for teens, too!""*

Kawaii Moe Shimapan -> Passionflower Tea: Makes Ayano more relaxed and, as a result, more trustworthy when apologizing since she doesn't come off like she's hiding anything.

*Description: ""A mild, floral, citrussy tea perfect for unwinding after a hard day.""*

Speedy Sporty Spats -> Ginseng Tea: Gives Ayano more energy that allows her to run faster.

*Description: ""An earthy, bitter, slightly sweet tea that makes for a great pre-workout drink!""*

Lewd Lacey Panties -> Lavender Tea: Makes Ayano calmer, so she won't leave as many bloody footprints behind when cleaning up evidence since she won't be in as much of a rush to dispose of evidence.

*Description: ""A light, floral tea with hints of other herbs that makes for one of the best sleepy-time teas.""*

Tiny Thong Panties -> Chamomile Tea: Makes Ayano calmer (it's stronger than the lavender tea) which makes her Sanity decrease slower.

*Description: ""A subtly sweet tea with hints of apple or pear, known for it's calming properties and being a sleepy-time tea classic!""*

Now at the top of the list, I mentioned Black Tea being in there for socialization (among other things but I digress). Well, to make up for the fact that the panties mechanic no longer exists (because, as much as i don't like it, it's kind of a central feature of the game 😔), Ayano has a new way to socialize with students outside of the usual interactions menu- she can invite them to have tea in the tea room between classes and start a small minigame that mainly exists just for fun, but does boost interactions if done right.

Now if you had a childhood like mine, chances are that you had unrestricted internet access. Why does this matter? Well, have you heard of Monster Prom by any chance? Well, the creator of that game has another game called- and bear with me- Max Gentleman: Sexy Business!, which is a business/dating sim rolled into one. The reason I bring it up is that the tea minigame functions similarly to the tea minigame in MG:SB, where the player has to deduce how the person they're interacting with likes their tea- however, since there's so many teas to choose from in my rewrite, all Ayano has to figure out is what strength, temperature, and sweeteners they like, since I'd imagine most students would tell Ayano what kind of tea they like up front. (I'll make a separate post about how students would like their tea because I'm bored and love adding more details than necessary :3)

This could also be used to unlock certain club-exclusive buffs temporarily, since Ayano would learn about more kinds of tea outside of just the panty-replacements (god that sounds so wrong out of context 😭), but they will only be available at a designated tea store in Buraza Town (it would probably take the place of the lingerie store since the panties don't matter anymore) since the club-substitute teas are specialized blends, which also means they'll be more expensive (this is to prevent the feature from being abused too much). If a student likes a certain kind of tea that Ayano doesn't have when she first asks them to join her for tea, they'll bring two bags of the tea they like with them but only for the first time as this'll unlock the tea blend at the tea shop.

**(On a side note, I might make the tea shop owner or owners Uekiya or another Gardening Club member's parents just because I think it'd be really cute and wholesome and lord knows this game needs more of that 😭 Also, not all clubs will have a replacement tea just because some of the club benefits would be really hard to get through a tea like how tf is Ayano drinking hot leaf juice gonna give her access to the Cooking Club's catering list or the Music Club's cello case** 😭\*\*)\*\*

*List of Club-Substitute Teas (Clubstitutes if you will):*

Occult Club = Evening/Ritual Tea (like [this blend](https://i.etsystatic.com/5476543/r/il/9694dc/4837837370/il_1140xN.4837837370_4n70.jpg) I found on Etsy) - This tea keeps Ayano almost eerily calm, so she'll only lose her sanity at 50% the normal rate, and it'll take longer for students to notice her acting suspicious since her calmness makes her seem like she's not hiding anything.

Martial Arts Club = Rooibos & Turmeric Chai Blend - This tea gives Ayano enough clarity to more swiftly win physical struggles (I feel like having her immediately win just from drinking tea would be a bit too overpowered, so I nerfed it to just making them easier).

Sports Club = Ginger Green Tea Blend - This tea gives Ayano a burst of energy that allows her to run faster (it can be combined with the Ginseng Tea to make an extra-strength speed buff tea but I'll explain that later).

Obviously this list is much shorter than the one for the panty replacements, but that's just because a majority of club benefits involve Ayano gaining access to certain items or other benefits that can't really be tied to a tea (like the Photography Club not investigating her if school atmosphere is below 80%), but to make up for the lack of club benefit teas, I'm gonna add ANOTHER category of tea!

**RIVAL TEAS**

So while I was looking at the panties page on the fandom wiki (i crave death) to figure out the initial teas, I noticed this tidbit at the top of the page.

[A blurb about an unimplemented feature revolving the rivals' panties.](https://preview.redd.it/j3o9x9nknrbf1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac1fd3cbca94f8b571a8115d4efb1791e8cc1bab)

I think the idea of Ayano getting a ""prize"" of sorts after eliminating each rival could be neat! But like...

[dude what 😭](https://preview.redd.it/8xg8k4e1orbf1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb721d7f9aa0c40a05b79009b38b3f8d2183e73d)

...of course the ""prize"" would be their panties, considering this is Semen Goblet we're talking about, and that idea kinda makes me feel icky because like...wtf is that implying if Ayano kills her rival and then unlocks that rival's panties?? I don't wanna think about that 😭 honestly i don't think i even wanna know the implications if she eliminates them peacefully either 😭

Anywho, back to the concept of Ayano gaining ""trophies"" of her rivals, I feel like they could vary depending on the elimination method she uses- but the rest are for another day, so let's just focus on the one ""trophy"" that's guaranteed regardless of elimination method- tea! I imagine there would be a few ways these teas/tea blends would be made available (outside of Info-Chan sending them to Ayano as kind of ""congrats for getting rid of your rival"" gifts)- for example, maybe Amai's family's bakery collaborates with the tea shop to release a tea based off one of their unique desserts, and maybe Osana's is just a custom blend she made at one of the shop's weekend workshops that the owners ended up liking enough to start selling (giving her a cut of the profits obviously), stuff like that! (Note: I'm going to be typing them in the order they appear in my rewrite just as a quick heads-up + unlike the other teas, Ayano *can* stack the effects of the rival teas with a club or panty tea, but can't be stacked with other rival teas just because they're a bit more powerful than the others since they're meant to be a reward for eliminating your rivals, which is also why Ayano can only drink them when she's at home, basically like how the current panties system works):

Amai Odayaka - Chocolate Eclair Cake Dessert Tea ([some ](https://svtea.com/collections/dessert-tea?srsltid=AfmBOoof8C8mFwxBUFS17Fn97Z3OkMVY3fUIBqlW_7hQ6qLd6aUI-jP-)[examples](https://www.republicoftea.com/dessert-teas/c/dessert/?srsltid=AfmBOortkDYKijytrt_BAt2BuNWhtFKokajzzujzvfGRjagJFKPF0W_N) of what dessert tea looks like + a [chocolate eclair](https://www.republicoftea.com/heartstopper-chocolate-eclair-herb-tea/p/v21047/?srsltid=AfmBOopE6K7h6o7CMoEpE7TayzjnOoI8qeWXSQiO_gAjDG8BC0xhWYCK) tea specifically): Carries a heavy aroma that reminds people of Amai, and will increase Ayano's reputation by 0.5 for every hour throughout the school day whenever she drinks it.

*Description: ""A delightfully decadent tea based off of one of the Odayaka Bakery's most famous desserts, created in collaboration with a local tea shop to celebrate the owners' daughter Amai Odayaka, who famously loves her mother's chocolate eclair cake.""* ***(If Amai is dead, the description will read the same but with 'celebrate' replaced with 'memorialize' and she will be referred to in the past tense, using words like 'loved' instead of 'loves.' This will pretty much apply to the other rivals, too.)***

Oka Ruto - Egyptian Licorice Tea: Something about this ""mysterious"" tea makes it take people longer to notice when Ayano is extremely close to them or following them.

*Description: ""An underrated classic nominated for the Buraza Tea Company's Tea of the Month by local high-school student Oka Ruto, citing the medicinal aroma and sweet & spicy flavor profile as her favorite things about the blend!""*

Kizana Sunobu - National Treasure Blooming Tea Blend: Composed of rose, jasmine, rosemary, and lavender, something about this tea seems to enchant the people around Ayano whenever she drinks it, making it far easier for her classmates to hang onto her every word. (This basically guarantees that Ayano's gossip *will* work regardless of whether or not the person she's talking to likes gossip or if they usually won't accept gossip about certain students like friends or crushes, the only exception to this being Raibaru)

*Description: ""A lovingly handcrafted blooming tea blend meant to celebrate one of our country's national treasures- me\~! -Love, Kizana Sunobu* 💋\*"" (yes she actually stamped the tea package with her lipstick- girlie literally melted down hundreds of one shade from a brand of lipstick she really likes and had industrial stamps made in the shape of her actually lipstick kiss print just so the Buraza Tea Company could stamp EACH INDIVIDUAL LABEL) \*Note: Also I thought it'd be really funny for her call herself a national treasure\*

Asu Rito - Custom Pre-Workout Tea Blend (kinda like[ this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1551133209/get-focused-pre-workout-tea?ls=s&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=pre+workout+tea&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&content_source=1a8cd077-4b58-45d5-8e53-ddb39c519762%253A6d86b5beba868ff88173f5a4bf615c1aae685077&organic_search_click=1&logging_key=1a8cd077-4b58-45d5-8e53-ddb39c519762%3A6d86b5beba868ff88173f5a4bf615c1aae685077)): Asu's very own pre-workout blend makes Ayano much stronger than normal, allowing her to keep up with some of Akademi's most athletic students, from Juku Ren to Unagi Denkashiza. Also has a side-effect of making her skin more quick to tan, oddly enough... (Basically she can instantly win fights with students with strength Weak or lower and more easily win against students that are Strong- fighting works as normal with people Very Strong and up)

*Description: ""This fruity, well-spiced tea takes heavy inspiration from western Southern Sweet Tea, being best enjoyed over ice with a nice, fresh slice of lemon!""*

Osoro Shidesu - Hickory Nut-Hojicha Mate Blend: The tea's complex and smoky flavor puts Ayano in Osoro's mindset, making it easier for her to intimidate other's into doing what she wants with very little repercussions. (This lets Ayano intimidate other students without being a member of the delinquents and lessens how much reputation she loses when she does it by taking the reputation penalty for intimidation down by 25% since students will be more hesitant to talk about Ayano behind her back lest she find them and beat their asses)

*Description: ""A robust, complex, smoky blend crafted by a local student during one of the Buraza Tea Company's Weekend Workshops! The student has politely asked to remain anonymous."" Note: Please do not threaten to break the bones of Buraza Tea Company staff when asking for anonymity during workshop tea releases.*

Muja Kina - Raspberry Rose Milk Tea with Honey: The tea's sweetness almost seems to transfer itself to Ayano's personality, and students will assume that Ayano is helping someone if they see her carrying something she shouldn't be. (This basically heavily reduces the amount of reputation lost when caught carrying a suspicious item by 75%, and will actually make it so Ayano initially doesn't lose *any* reputation because students, like mentioned above, will just think she's helping someone like a faculty or student council member with something the first time they see her carrying something suspicious- the only time this won't work is if Ayano's caught carrying a long blade that isn't the guitar from the Light Music Club room or the scrap metal from the incinerator area (students will just assume she's helping someone in the Science Club), and, if she's in the Gardening or Science Club, the circular saw)

*Description: ""This sweet, tart milk tea was created to celebrate one of our local nurses- miss Muja Kina, who the Buraza Tea Company congratulates for completing her training under local school nurse Nasu Kankoshi!"" (If Muja's dead or missing, it will instead say that it was nominated by Nasu to memorialize Muja.)*

Mida Rana - Lovers' Sangria Blend: Something about this tea reminds many students of Mida Rana, so much so that some seem to perceive Ayano as having more authority than she actually does when she drinks it and will more easily give in to her demands. (Basically Teacher's Pets act like Ayano is at max Seduction level when she drinks it)

*Description: ""This lovely tea blend comes from one of our local teachers who has asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of this blend- perfect for setting a cozy mood with your sweetheart, and comes in a special Buraza Tea Company Sangria Kit to celebrate Teacher Appreciation Month!""* (Fun Fact: The actual tea blend itself consists of fig, pomegranate, vanilla, jasmine, rose, passionflower, & cacao; all of which are natural aphrodisiacs that I imagine Mida would enjoy a lot outside of school)

Megami Saikou - Strong Focus/Productivity Boosting Sweet Tea Bombs (kinda like [this blend from Etsy](https://i.etsystatic.com/11654139/r/il/39b30f/6099696071/il_1140xN.6099696071_9zya.jpg)): The aroma of this tea reminds students of Megami Saikou, and seems to make teachers more willing to look the other way if Ayano's caught misbehaving. (Basically teachers will automatically assume that bodies, blood, weapons, etc. are just bad jokes on the first time, but will investigate if the same evidence is reported to them again)

*Description: ""Created by Saikou Corp heiress and local student Megami Saikou, she believes that focus, productivity, and efficiency are keen to running a company (or student council) smoothly! Hence why she's kindly collaborated with the Buraza Tea Company to produce her personal focus & productivity sweet tea tea bombs to usher in the Buraza Tea Company's new product! Just drop one into a cup of hot water, and then ice if you'd so like!"" (Yes they are totally kissing her & her family's ass)*

Osana Najimi - Sweet & Tart Tea Bombs: These tart yet sugary sweet tea bombs remind a particular student of her best friend, and make her willing to do almost anything for Ayano. (Basically Raibaru treats Ayano like Osana whenever she drinks this tea, which lets Ayano ask favors from her like any other befriended student, and she can ask Raibaru to meet her in specific locations without leaving a note in her locker)

*Description: ""These uniquely tart sweet tea bombs were created by local student Osana Najimi at one of the Buraza Tea Company's first ever tea bomb workshops! These lovely tea bombs are perfect for spring and summer, especially when paired with some fresh citrus!""* (Fun Fact: The tea blend used for the bombs consists of orange, rose hip, strawberry, raspberry, and pineapple fruit-infused teas added to a naturally sweet green tea blend)

Hanako Yamada - Strawberry Banana-Taro Swirl Boba Kit (+ reusable cat tumbler! :D): This cloyingly sweet boba kit puts Ayano in a childish, excitable state of mind that make people view Ayano as less of a scheming manipulator and instead a clumsy, childish girl that never grew up. As a result, Ayano won't look suspicious when picking up a weapon, and she can now pretend to trip to splash students with buckets without being penalized for it. (Since Hanako is Ayano's toughest and final rival in my rewrite, her tea is kind of meant to be a useful tool in my hypothetical rewrite game's Endless Mode)

*Description: ""This sweet, not-so-simple tribute tea was created by Buraza Town local Hanako Yamada to celebrate her close relationship with her older brother Taro by incorporating a part of him into her favorite flavor of the Buraza Tea Company's boba tea kits- sweet, creamy taro milk tea is swirled in with the Buraza Tea Company's signature, housemade strawberry-banana milk tea, complete with heart-shaped tapioca pearls! \*Note: Only the first 100 kits sold come with an exclusive reusable Buraza Tea Company tumbler""*

**Buraza Tea Company - Prices & Clerks ft. LOOOOOOOOORE (a little bit anyway)**

So, as I mentioned above, I think it'd be cute if the tea shop's owners or staff were related to one of the Gardening Club girls- *buuuuut* I also really like the 1980's Gardening Club members too, so what to do? Simple!

[Threw together a little graphic of what I imagine Uekiya's family to be like \(No trauma this time! :D also i forgot to change Shirotsume's eye color to match Uekiya's 😭\)](https://preview.redd.it/du5jdaas47cf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4af27feb2e06b6c4bf2fa94769be3cb472f63ec)

I don't wanna get *too* deep into the Engeika family lore I have since this is meant to be a post about the tea shop/tea set mechanic, but to give you the basics:

\- Gota & Shirotsume first met in their college's horticulture program (also quick reminder that Akademi's an actual high school in my rewrite and not whatever post-high school academy bs Semen Goblet's using so he can sexualize the characters so this takes place roughly 2-3 years after the events of 1980's mode) and quickly got along because they had a lot in common, sharing a love for protecting the environment.

\- They got married pretty soon after graduation and opened up a tea & herbs shop in Buraza Town (it wasn't as big or bustling back then so there were a lot of options of where they could set up shop), choosing to build their store on a street close to a school so that they could always be able to run over to the school if there was ever an emergency (they're chronic worriers & Uekiya gets it from them).

\- Uekiya grew up to share their passion for gardening and the environment (and their tendency to worry a lot).

\- Gota will be the clerk for the tea store on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; Shirotsume will be the clerk on Tuesdays and Thursdays; Uekiya will be the clerk on weekends and be carrying Hiyori on her back (if she's dead or missing, Shirotsume will be the clerk on Saturdays while Gota will be the clerk on Sundays- both will have Hiyori on their backs as well, but will look more visibly sad and tired as they try to keep a smile on their face for Hiyori, who will also look noticeably upset).

\- If someone witnesses Ayano murdering and/or attacking Uekiya but she doesn't get arrested for it, she will be banned from the tea shop for the rest of the game (Info-Chan will be the one to send her fresh sets of the rival teas every week from then on).

I'll share more about the Engeika family and their dynamics in my next random changes post, but for now let's shift our focus to the actual tea shop: The Buraza Tea Company, and more specifically, its prices:

*\*One purchase of tea gives Ayano five servings/tea bags*

Panty-Buff Teas = 4.99 per purchase

Clubstitute Teas = 10.99 per purchase

Rival Teas = 7.99 per purchase

There are other places Ayano can get most of the other teas from, but I'll talk about those in their own separate posts.

**Wait the Home Ec Room is actually useful in 20XX mode now-**

As the opener for this section suggests, the Home Ec Room is far more useful in 20XX mode outside of pipe-bombing Amai :D

Obviously Ayano can use the one countertop to complete the meal task (some of the 20XX mode students have the placeholder tasks from 1980's mode), but now she can ALSO use it to, among other things, make special kinds of tea, specifically-

***LACED TEA!!!***

...anyways, once Ayano unlocks the tea set, she also unlocks some a new service from Info-Chan, specifically the recipes to make laced tea for 25 points (goes up by five depending on the strength of the poison being used in the recipe). The teas that are used in each recipe basically act as a way to mask the flavor or smell of the poison until it's too late. (If Ayano gives a student non-lethal poisoned tea after inviting them to have tea with her, depending on her reputation, they'll refuse to join her at the tea house for a day (high reputation), three days (medium reputation), or the rest of the week (low reputation) because they don't want to get sick again. She can also swap the teabags for the Student Council's tea set for her laced ones as long as she doesn't get caught- if someone catches her tampering with the tea bags, the council room will be locked for the rest of the game- she can pick the lock only a few times without relocking the room before the council also installs a security camera right outside their office Info-Chan style).

The recipes for laced tea are:

Peppermint Tea + Passionflower Tea + Emetic Poison = Emetic Tea/Emetic Blend

Yerba Mate + Headache Poison = Headache Tea/Migraine Blend

Lavender Tea + Chamomile Tea + Sedative = Sedative Tea/Blackout Blend (there will be a storage case in the tea room Ayano can use for kidnapping students)

Children's Tea + Black Tea + Ginkgo Tea + Lethal Poison = Lethal Tea/Sip of Death (Ayano can hide the body of poisoned student in the case mentioned for the Sedative Tea, but must dispose of them properly by the end of the day or else the body will be discovered- Ayano also **cannot** be caught crafting this recipe by anyone or else she'll be immediately expelled since it doesn't take a genius to realize what she's doing. Only the Student Council members will react to Ayano making laced tea with the other poisons since they know she's up to something, and even then they'll just send her to the guidance counselor since, ultimately, the other three poisons won't harm the student in the long run unless Ayano decides to just poison that one student in particular just because.

When I was a child, my grandmother used to tell me stories of the Chosen One. At the time, I never gave them much thought. Thinking they were just that… stories. Growing up, I soon realized that they weren’t lofty fantasies and fairy tales, but memories of her past, memories of our ancestors before our world turned to shit.

When the uprising happened twelve years ago, all Fae creatures fought alongside the elves and the angels trying to right the wrongs of our ancestors from the great war, trying to restore the balance back to where it was meant to be.

My parents were among those who fought bravely. I was nine at the time. My grandmother hid me in the bunker under our house, promising to watch over me if they didn’t return.

Only when we came back up, the world had changed, and so did my life. My parents were gone. Not a single person who fought in the war survived. No Elves, no Fae, no Angels. Even the humans were mostly wiped out, including the Oracle. Her death was the biggest blow because with it, we lost not only lives, but our magic.

I was part of a dying species. There were hardly any Fae left. A few hid, but we tried our best to keep to the shadows, trying to go unnoticed. I had never met another Fae other than my grandmother, yet I refused to believe we are the only ones left.

We were on the bottom of the food chain now, next to humans. Ruled over by the Dragon Kingdom.

The Dragon Kingdom was different from any before it, and those that ruled were merciless and cruel. No one was allowed in or out without their say so.

I have never left the city, forced to hide amongst those that live here, hoping that we remain unnoticed. Because being Fae was a death sentence.

At the top of the food chain were the Dragons, then the Lycans and Vampires. We used to be next before the Elves and the Pixies, then the Mermaids. Right at the bottom were humans.

Now we were right beside them, the scavengers of the world, taking what was left after the rest discarded what they didn’t want. Fae without magic might as well have been human. We look like humans except our eyes, each unique to our bloodline. Mine were the color of amethyst, like my mother’s bloodline.

My bloodline was all but eradicated. We used to be among one of the largest Fae families, helping to rule among our kind. My bloodline was royalty, now gone, just like our ancestors, leaving only me and my grandmother.

My grandmother said our bloodline used to be among the royal Fae, that our ancestors achieved great things. Now I was the last one of our bloodline and possibly the second last Fae. Once I go, that’s it. The survival of my bloodline rests entirely upon my shoulders.

Yep, the future didn’t look great for my family, soon to be snuffed out of existence.

My twenty-first birthday was coming up. I had been dreading this day for as long as I could remember, the day when they would hunt me down and drag me to the castle. There weren’t many job opportunities for Fae, just like the humans.

Fae were now nothing but a distant memory people refuse to believe existed, so we disguise ourselves by blending in with the humans. Most humans were sold into the sex trade or into slavery, unless, of course, you were caught and proven to be Fae.

Then you only earned the right to die painfully for the sins of your ancestors. That is why no Fae exists. That is why my grandmother and I keep to the shadows, blending in with the humans, so we remain unnoticed.

Turning twenty-one was a significant day for Fae creatures. It is the day when our magic is supposed to manifest. No Fae have been found since the uprising, at least not that I know of. It’s believed when we lost the war, then the Oracle it angered the fates, and they shunned the Fae stripping us of our magic. The ancestors turned their backs on all of us.

My grandmother told me it was to try to stop the extinction of our kind, yet I believe they just gave up on all of us.

These days, Dragons and vampires summon all humans on their birthdays. Humans would line up and stand before the rulers, who would ultimately decide their fate. If you showed any magical ability, they killed you instantly, whether or not you were Fae.

In one week, they would summon me. My grandmother and I have remained hidden in the hopes I go unnoticed. My grandmother refused, point blank, to let them find me. She could not imagine me being sold off to the highest bidder.

Yet, deep down, I knew she was powerless to stop them. Sure, she had power, the only Fae on earth with ancient magic still flowing through her veins. The magic that had kept us alive. Yet her magic was slowly dwindling. It would eventually die out. Then, we would truly face our demise.

My grandmother coughs as she comes up behind me, pulling me from my thoughts. She grabs my hand, making me look at her. Her pale face holds a knowing look, like she knew what I was thinking. I never doubted her ability to read people. She often knew me better than I knew myself.

“What are you thinking, my child?” she asks, her eyes softening as she looks at me.

“Nothing grandma, but I will go get something for that cough. It has lasted too long,” I say worriedly. I can’t afford to lose her too. She was all I had left in this world. My grandmother shook her head, but I stood up, not taking no for an answer.

“Here take this,” she said, pulling her wedding band from her withered old finger, it slipped off easily, much too big for her frail finger. The ring was one of her most prized possessions, with intricate vines wrapping around the band.

“I won’t allow you to sell any more of your mother’s things for me.” I hold the gold band in my hand. It was another family heirloom that was given to her by her late husband, my pop. Passed down from his mother. I close my hand before dropping it into the pocket of my jeans.

“I will be as quick as possible, grandma. Try and stay warm,” I tell her, trying to put her mind at ease.

I grab my coat, throwing it on as I walk outside. The snow is sinking into my holey shoes, making my toes go numb.

We wanted to leave the city, but the Dragon lords refused to let anyone leave. Guards are stationed at every checkpoint, and in our opinion, it wasn’t worth the risk.

But being a Fae in the city was hard. I struggled finding work because I couldn’t remain in one place for too long; anyone looking too hard would be able to tell I was Fae. My grandmother, who was unable to use magic to disguise herself, could not work either.

So, my options were scavenging and bartering or being forced to steal.

Walking up the muddy streets, I retrieve my contact lenses and pop them in, instantly turning my eyes to a mud brown. I hate wearing them, my vision was enhanced being Fae, and I could see every line on the thin film irritating my vision.

Rounding the corner onto the next street, I glance up to see the dirty wooden sign that indicated I had arrived at the pharmacist.

The man that worked there was a nice human, and since money was scarce here, he would allow me to barter for what I needed, gold being one the hardest-to-come-by currencies yet also the most valuable.

I drop my gaze and start walking, trying to blend into the crowds of people. Making my way into the derelict store, I remove my hood, letting my black hair cascade down my back like a veil.

Victor, the store owner, looks up. A smile plays on his lips when he sees me. He always liked my grandmother. They used to be friends before everything went to shit.

“Elora dear, how is your grandmother?” he asks.

“Not good, Victor. The cough hasn’t gone away. She is getting worse,” I tell him, retrieving my grandmother’s wedding band from my pocket.

I drop it on the counter, shooting him a knowing look. He snatches it, placing it in his pocket, and nods his head before ducking out the back and bringing back a bottle of liquid. Victor knows what my grandmother is, yet he never mentions it, knowing it is a death sentence if anyone heard him speak of the Fae.

“Give her this three times a day; I haven’t got anything stronger. Herbs are becoming harder to find, especially in the winter.” I nod before grabbing the bottle and placing my hood back over my head.

“Elora stay safe out there,” he warns, following behind me, getting ready to barricade himself in before those that go bump in the night come out to play.

Bowing my head against prying eyes, I take off for home, running. When I reach the corner, I run into someone.

I mutter “Sorry” at them before I go to take off, only for them to grab my arm, ripping me in front of them. His grip on my arm is tight but also warm as I feel his heat seep into my skin through the jacket.

“Take the hood off,” a man’s deep voice commands. I try to free myself of his grip, yet he is stronger.

He yanks my hood off, revealing my black hair. I continue averting my eyes. My heart skips a beat when I hear his voice again.

“Look at me, girl,” the voice grumbles.

I shake my head, trying yet again to wriggle out of his grip. He grabs my face, forcing my eyes to look into his.

My eyes dart to his gold reptilian eyes, fear clear on my faces.

This man is Dragon!

**Chapter 2**

Dragons stood taller than any other supernatural creature in the city, they also had this air around them that told you they were a predator. Their godlike appearances made it blatantly obvious what they are.

However, only three Dragons resided in this city. The dragon lords ruled, and the city was their playground and they only allowed us to merely exist here.

Another strange fact about Dragons was no female dragons had been born since the war, making the Dragon lords angry, fuelling their hate for the Fae. They too were a dying species.

Although immortal, most have spent their lives alone or chose to take another male as a mate. I had seen the Dragon lords from afar, but never got close enough to actually meet one and I prayed I never would.

There are three lords and rumors circulated through the city that when they couldn’t find their mates, they chose to mate each other, hoping to keep themselves strong enough to rule over the kingdom.

Sometimes people would be forced into the castle, never to be seen again. That was particularly true for any woman to pass through those gates.

Dragons were insatiable and impulsive, usually taking a woman before killing her, it didn’t matter what species or status they held, no one survived them once they stepped through those iron gates.

That's the kind of crisis I was facing right now. I was afraid of this Dragon would take me because I didn’t follow his command.

I hear him growl lowly; it rumbles through his chest, his eyes flicker dangerously, eyes that weren’t human, his tan skin is warm even through my parka.

I barely reached the middle of his chest. His hair was dark, almost black in color but longer on top, he looked like he hadn’t shaved for a couple of days, stubble lining his face, his features were sharp, high cheekbones and nice full lips, he looked like a woman’s wet dream. Yet his aura was intimidating, his grip on me unrelenting.

“What are you?” he demands.

One thing I hated about being Fae was our inability to lie. We could beat around the bush but couldn’t answer a direct question dishonestly. I press my lips into a tight line, fighting the urge to answer as I stare wide eyed at the man.

A fight between two homeless people breaks out up the street, distracting him for a second. I don’t waste any time before ripping my parka off and sliding my arms out, escaping his clutches.

I hear a mighty roar and know he is chasing after me. I keep running, refusing to look back.

When I see houses lined up along the street, I dart through their yards, jumping fence after fence and finally losing him.

Desperate, I continue to run until I find our house, bursting through the door and slamming it shut behind me. My heart was pounding in my chest so hard I could hear its erratic rhythm. That was close, too close.

“Elora dear, is that you?” I hear my grandma say before she breaks out into a violent coughing fit. I make my way to her; she is still in the kitchen sitting at the table. She smiles softly before noticing my jacket is missing.

“What happened?” she asks breathlessly. Worry making her thin brows furrow.

“I ran into a Dragon,” I say, my voice shaking. “He chased me, but I think I lost him.”

My grandmother frowns in mild panic and starts coughing again. I race to her side, looking on helplessly as the coughing fit racks her slight frame.

“I lost the medicine grandma; it was in the jacket. I will have to try again tomorrow,” I tell her, tears welling in my eyes.

“It is okay dear, what matters is you are safe now,” she murmurs, though I can sense the fear of me nearly being caught worrying her. Her hands tremble slightly on the table as her nails tap with worry.

The night goes quickly. We were asleep when we heard the voices of people out in the street screaming. I jolt upright, paralysed with fear. Walking over to the window, I pull the curtain back and peer out, seeing men with torches, some in human form, others not.

They were ripping people into the street, going from door to door. I see a man in armour go to the house next door to us before I hear the shrill sound of a woman screaming as she is dragged into the street, her family looking on helplessly as she is dragged by her hair.

My blood runs cold hearing her begging and pleading with them as they drag her from her house. The entire street is in chaos. I run over to the couch where my grandmother is sleeping, only she too is now wide awake and looking alert having heard the cries of everyone on the street.

“Grandma get up we need to leave. They are going door to door,” I whisper, slipping my holey boots on my feet and quickly doing the laces. Slipping my contacts in, I hear more screams coming from outside and people fighting.

“Come on, grandma get up,” I tell her, pulling on her arm. She shakes her head before pulling a small knife from the coffee table drawer into her lap. She looks up at me with a sad look on her face.

“Run, Elora. I won’t allow them to know. I will only slow you down. You need to leave without me,” she whispers. I looked at her, panicked. What is she talking about?

“No grandma, come on. We need to leave now,” I tell her, trying to get her to her feet. She shakes me off and shakes her head.

“I promised to keep you safe. I can’t if you don’t go now.”

“What are you talking about, grandma? Promised who?”

“Remember the stories, Elora. You need to remember the stories. Now run.”

“No, I am not leaving without you.” I tell her, feeling tears running down my face. Before someone bangs on the door so hard, I thought it was going to smash off its hinges.

“Please grandma, we have to go.”

“I love you, Elora,” my grandma whispers before raising the knife and slashing her own throat. I scream and clutch at her neck, trying to stem the bleeding.

“Run,” she gurgles out. Just as they kicked the door in, my hands coated in her blood. Adrenaline kicks in, and I take off out the back door, through the criss-crossed streets of the city.

I can hear a soft sobbing only to realize it was coming from me as hot tears run down my cheeks at what my grandmother just did. The images forever burnt into my memory.

I clamp my hand over my mouth, trying to stop the noises I am making, my breathing erratic. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. Looking over the dumpster, I duck back down behind the dumpster when I hear a man call out, pointing in my direction.

“You there! Stop!” I don’t listen; instead, I take off running. I run to the end of the alleyway to find it is blocked off by a building and a brick wall making it dead-end.

Hearing someone crying behind the dumpster, I look down only to notice a little girl dressed in rags. I pull the ladder down and reach my hand down to her.

“Where is your mother?” I ask, peering down at her tear-stained face.

“They took her,” she sobs.

Without hesitating, I hoist her up so she can climb, and together we race upwards toward the roof. But not fast enough for the vampire chasing us.

A strong hand grips my ankle, ripping me back down to the ground. I fall painfully on top of a man, my head smacking the ground with a loud thud as I bite into my tongue. Another man retrieves the girl, and I hear her scream before a loud SMACK comes from him slapping her on the face.

Her dirty matted blonde hair is all I see as her head whips to the side, blood trickling from her lip and the sound of flesh on flesh echoing down the alleyway.

“Leave her, she is just a child!” I scream. The little human girl, who appears to be maybe nine years old, escapes the man and runs behind me, hiding against my back.

A tall man with black armour walks over his hair down to shoulders and a huge scar across his face, his crimson eyes reflecting oddly as he stares at us.

A Vampire.

**Chapter 3**

Chapter 3

“Hurry up, bring them to the castle with the rest of them,” he yells to the other men. The man who caught me grabs my hair, the roots painfully tearing from my skull as my head is yanked back.

“Move,” he screams in my face. I obey, following the Vampire man dressed in black armour. The little girl hangs onto the back of my shirt.

When we get to the main street, I find a huge line of women being herded to the castle. They shove us in the line behind more women, all sobbing as they had been ripped out of their beds in the middle of the night and torn away from their families.

When we finally walk through the high castle gates, I find the group of women all separated into rows. A man I recognize to be a Dragon standing at the front, watching everyone be dragged in and lined up. I am in one of the middle rows.

When I see his eyes dart over the crowd, I quickly duck my head down, hoping he didn’t notice me staring. Another man walks along the first line looking at each person and grips their faces looking at their eyes. He then dismisses them, and another man marches them back out the iron gates once they have been cleared and declared not to be whomever they were looking for.

I make sure to keep my head down to avoid making eye contact.

However, a deep husky voice comes above my head. “Look at me,” I can feel his eye penetrating into me.

I flinch away from the anger in his words. He grabs my hair, pulling my head back. I close my eyes breathing through the pain searing through my skull as I feel my hair being ripped out.

“I said look at me,” he growls again. I slowly raise my head to be met with the same hypnotic gold snake eyes of the man I ran into on the street. He scrutinizes my face before letting my hair go. My eyes instantly snap back to the ground.

“Remove them,” he says, his voice daring me to disobey.

“What?” I whisper, confused.

“The contact lenses; remove them now.” I shake my head in a pleading sort of way, knowing if I do, I will be killed instantly.

“Remove them or I will,” he grumbles, grabbing my arm. I whimper at his rough voice echoing into the darkness, making me shiver. I slowly lift my fingers, and one by one, I took out the contact lenses to reveal my sparkling violet eyes . He grabs my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his.

I hear everyone gasp before I hear the murmur of whispers throughout the crowd.

“Fae.”

“She is a Fae.” Everyone’s eyes on mine, which I know are glowing fluorescently into the night. Burning brightly like an amethyst beacon.

“Silence,” the man yells out to the crowd. The chatter instantly died down at his words.

“I knew I sensed a Fae when you bumped into me.” His lips were next to my ear, his cool breath sending shivers down my spine as he moves closer. He leans in inhaling my scent and I can feel his lips barely touching the skin in the crook of my neck.

“You’re coming with me,” he whispers, grabbing me and pulling me towards the old sandstone castle. It was huge, and something right out of a fairy tale, only dark and covered in snow, the vines growing along the sides looked like snakes, dying from the cold and the sandstone high walls tarnished from not being maintained properly.

I struggle, trying to free myself from his grip. He looks to one of the guards that we pass.

“Kill the rest,” he commands, and chaos ensues. All the women’s voices start screaming, echoing through the night at his words. Fear so pungent I could smell and taste it, as the guards moved closer, circling around and trapping them, and leaving them nowhere to run.

“No please, they didn’t do anything,” I begged as I fought against him. He stops and looks down at me and I cower away from his gaze, knowing I shouldn’t speak out of turn, especially to a Dragon king.

He grabs my face, making me look at him.

“Please, I will do anything you want, just don’t hurt them,” I beg. Tears roll down my face as I glance at the women behind me, begging for their lives. All staring at me, fear in their eyes as all the guards freeze waiting for his answer. His thumb rubs over my bottom lip, and a smirk forms on his lips.

“Anything?” he asks, his thumb pulling on my bottom lip softly. My eyes move back to the crowd behind him, before looking down at the little girl still clinging onto my shirt.

The fear in their eyes makes a tear slip from mine, all begging me to agree with whatever it is he wants from me.

“Yes, anything,” I whisper, feeling defeated. He smiles, and I can see all his perfectly straight pearly white teeth gleaming back at me.

I study his face. He has an evil glint in his eye, like he is looking at his prey. Nice full lips and high cheekbones with a firm jaw. He looks like the reincarnation of a god, built strong and beautiful, only I know he is the devil in disguise.

“Let them go,” he commands, raising his voice, his eyes not leaving mine. I shudder at the thought of being alone with this big brooding man. I hear the little girl sob beside me, which makes the man focus his gaze on her.

Pushing her behind me with my hand, his eyes snap back to mine, a devious smile playing on his lips.

“She is coming too,” he says, not leaving any room for argument, not that I would dare argue back. I hear everyone running out of the castle gates before he changes his mind. Before I hear the metal gates shut loudly, the steel groans as the lock slips into place.

He tugs my arm, pulling me toward the castle. Torches are lit along the path as we walk toward it. The only light coming from the lanterns next to the huge heavy double doors leading inside the castle.

He walks down a hall before leading us up some stairs. My feet make noises on the stone steps as we climb them. He pulls me to a door and opens it, swinging it open to reveal a room. A huge four-poster bed sits in the middle with black gauze hanging from the top.

He lets me go, leaving me standing in the middle of the room in front of another fireplace that is taller than me. The warmth is a welcome relief after spending hours in the cold. However, I feel more terrified than ever. He folds his arms over his bulging, muscular chest.

Another man enters the room, his skin the color of mocha, with dark onyx eyes. His chest is bare, revealing his muscular body and abs that look like they are carved from stone, a deep v-line disappearing into the waistband of his pants.

He smiles when he walks in, noticing me. I can tell he isn’t a Dragon but Lycan, which leaves me confused. Only the Dragon Kings live in the castle with their slaves, so why was this man standing beside a Dragon?

“You found her,” says the Lycan; his voice is silky and deep with a slight accent I do not recognize. He smiles, revealing his sharp teeth. As his eyes look me up and down.

I take a step back, feeling my heart thumping faster in my chest. He steps forward, crossing his arms across his chest. Both of them are standing over me.

“Strip,” says the Dragon King. I shake my head, not wanting to remove my clothes in front of their watchful, lust-filled eyes.

**Chapter 4**

“I said strip,” he repeats, raising an eyebrow at me, daring me to disobey.

I struggle to remove my shirt, trying to cover my bare chest by turning away from him. The girl beside me starts to remove her clothes as well.

“Not you, child. I don’t want to see you naked; you’re only here to make sure she obeys orders,” he says, making me relieved as she pulls her dress strap back up.

I remove my pants, leaving me only in my panties. Using my hands, I cover my breasts before turning around to face them.

The Lycan man steps forward, he licks his lips approvingly making me flinch. “Remove them,” he says looking down at my panties.

“Please,” I beg, not wanting to remove them.

“Remove them or I kill the child,” he says tauntingly. I look at the little girl who darted behind me at his words. I feel my cheeks burn with embarrassment.

This was so degrading and humiliating.

I pull my panties down before placing one hand over my breasts and the other trying to cover my lady parts. Both men step forward and I step back, nearly tripping over the girl behind me.

The Lycan man grabs my wrist, pulling my arm away from my chest, my ample breasts on display for them. I feel a tear run down my cheek as the other man removes my hand from my sensitive parts.

“Why are you crying? You have nothing to be embarrassed about,” says the Dragon. How didn’t they understand how degrading this is? No one should have to be put through this humiliation. I had never been naked in front of anyone besides my grandmother.

“Open your legs,” he growls, stepping closer. The Lycan man peers around me.

“Close your eyes little one,” he whispers to the small girl, and I feel a sob leave my lips. When the girl does as she is told, he stands upright.

He taps my foot with his, forcing my legs apart. His fingers move to my slit before he shoves his finger inside me quickly before removing it. I cry out at the sudden intrusion.

“A virgin like I thought,” he murmurs. I watch horrified as he sucks the finger into his mouth and moans loudly.

“You made me strip to see if I was a virgin? What, asking was too hard?” I ask but instantly regret it as they both step closer.

“You can put your clothes back on,” he says. The Dragon bent down and picked up my shoes. He looks at them before tossing them in the fireplace. I quickly get dressed.

“Follow us, we will take you to your chambers,” the Lycan man says. We follow silently. The Lycan leads the way while the Dragon remains behind us. I can feel his eyes boring into my back, feel the little girl’s arms grip my hips tightly.

We stop outside a door on the bottom floor, he opens the door and reveals a small room with a single bed and small fireplace.

I watch mesmerised as the Dragon man walks in and over to the fireplace, he takes a breath in then blows it out of his mouth like he's blowing a kiss. Yet I can feel the heat in the air rising rapidly as the logs start burning catching alight. He turns and winks at me.

I notice off to the side is a bathroom with a shower and toilet. I don’t move though, too scared by the men standing in front of me, I don’t want to risk angering them.

“You will stay here for now until Silas comes back and verifies you are who we think you are,” says the Lycan man, his eyes burning oddly mirroring the flames coming from the fireplace.

“If you need anything knock on the door, someone will hear you. My name is Matitus, this is Dragus,” says the man I recognize to be a Dragon. I store their names to memory, hoping I never have to utter them.

They then walk out, closing the door behind them. The little girl tugs at my shirt making me look down at her.

“Are they going to kill us?” she asks, concerned. Now that they are gone, I can really look at her. The poor girl is underweight, not that that is something unheard of in the city, starvation being the main killer.

“I don’t think so, well I don’t think they will kill you anyway,” I tell her. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, and an old woman who I believe is a human walks in with her head down carrying towels and a pile of clothes. Yet something seemed off about her, I just couldn’t put my finger on why I felt that way.

“For you,” she mutters, her eyes never peering up. She thrusts them forward again and I grab them from her before she hurriedly walks back out. I can sense her fear, like she was told not to talk to linger too long.

It would also make sense why she didn’t look up and make eye contact. She then shuts the door and I hear the jingle of keys and I know she locked it. I place the clothes on the bed along with the towels.

“What is your name?” I ask the little girl who comes and stands beside me. “Lilith” she whispers, looking at the pile.

“My name is Elora,” I tell her.

“Elora?” she repeats, trying out my name and making me smile. I dig through the clothes and take Lilith to the shower.

After that, we sit in front of the fire for a while and eventually fall asleep.

I am jolted awake when I hear the door swing open, creaking loudly. Matitus, one of the Dragon Kings, is standing in the doorway. I sit up, groggy before recognition hits me and I become anxious.

Dropping my gaze to the floor. My long black hair falling to my sides creating a veil. I see his boots come into my line of vision. He then kneels in front of me and grips my chin, bringing my gaze to meet his own.

“Why aren’t you sleeping on the bed?” he asks curiously.

“We fell asleep,” I tell him. I watch as he cocked his head to the side examining my face carefully before he lets go of my chin. I see Dragus walk in behind him carrying a tray with what smells like chicken soup. He sets the tray on the desk.

“Get on the bed,” Dragus says, making me glance at him. I feel sick suddenly, my blood running cold at his words. He seems to notice what he said before putting his hands up in mock surrender.

“Not in that way, take the girl with you,” he says, looking down at Lilith laying on the floor. I place my hand on her back, shaking her softly. Her eyes open before she jolts upright leaning against me in fear as she tries to get as far away from them as possible. I stand up to suddenly feel the cut on my back reopen and tear.

I grimace, feeling warm blood running down my spine, but I ignore it. Instead picking up Lilith and placing her so she is sitting on the edge of the bed.

I go to sit beside her, when I feel hot fingers move across my shoulder brushing my hair out of the way before lightly tracing the mark running from my left shoulder down to my right hip. I flinch slightly as it stings. I can feel the singlet sticking to the blood as his fingers run over it.

“Silas won’t like that” I hear Dragus mutter as I sit next to Lilith on the bed. Dragus then brings the tray over, sitting it between us both. Lilith looks at me unsure and I nod my head telling her it’s okay.

She must be starving, and when she finishes her piece of bread, I give her mine before turning to look at the two men standing in the room. They are both still watching me with indecipherable expressions on their faces.

“What is your name?” Matitus asks. Instead of answering I fight the urge and ask a question of my own, trying to avoid giving them my name. I know if they ask again, I won’t be able to help but answer them.

“What do you want with me?” They seem taken aback by my question and I have a feeling no one who has stepped in this castle has ever spoken out of line, let alone asked them a question as to their intentions.

“Your name?” Matitus asks his tone telling me to answer or else. I shiver as the urge to answer honestly takes over; I try to fight against it, sweat beading on my neck. Trying to ignore a direct question is painful to a Fae, telling a lie is almost impossible. One of the things I hate about being Fae. Matitus steps closer his hand cupping my cheek.

“Fae can’t lie or help but to answer. Why are you fighting against answering me?”

I shake my head and his fingers stroke my cheek softly, I grit my teeth trying to fight the urge to answer. “Elora” I stammer out breathlessly.

“Good girl,” he says, letting go of my face and stepping back.

“Why didn’t you want to answer?” he asks, cocking his head to the side. I see Dragus also watching me intently, his face holding some emotion, I don’t recognize. Was it awe? Wonder? I don’t know but it made me uncomfortable. I grit my teeth at his question not wanting to answer, but I know the words will come out anyway.

“Elora Aziza.” My words spew out of me in a rush.

“You’re from a royal bloodline?” Matitus steps back, recognition shining in his eyes, and he looks to Dragus.",1,1752218144.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I(27F) have been working at this company for a year now. Fortunately I have a lot of colleagues who are around my age and we all have become friends over the year. We go on frequent trips/dinners/outings. I am a very reserved person, opening up to people only after I get to know their intentions with me so it took me a while to mingle with everyone.

This guy in particular, Mr.S(28M) always used to make sure I am included in all the plans, personally inviting me everywhere. So I always felt nice spending time with him. While I was still getting to know everyone else, Mr.S was a
very nice to me, used to praise me a-lot, bring homemade food for me, getting coffee for me. I started developing a liking towards him..started dressing up nicer for work, putting in some extra efforts. We started going for walks in the Lunch break, having elaborated discussions on different topics, mostly related to family/marriage/relationships. It didn’t take me a long time to realise what his intentions were and I had a conversation about it with him. 

I had come out of a serious relationship a while back and I was not ready to get into another relationship just yet so I clarified my side to him. Even though I liked how he treated me, there was nothing in particular about him that I found attractive other than the fact that he was giving me the ‘special treatment’. He confessed him feelings for me even after hearing my side and did not expect anything in return. 

I slowly started getting close to other people in my office as well, ended up getting super close with a few girls and we planned a girl’s night at one coworker’s place. We were all having fun, getting a little drunk when one of the girl asked me..’Why are you playing around with a committed guy?’ 

 I was confused by the question and asked her explain herself a bit. That’s when I got to know that Mr.S is actually a committed guy; Have been for YEARS at this point and planning to get married. My soul left my body in that moment. I felt so betrayed and ashamed at the same time. I explained my side to everyone there and asked for more details. 

 Next day, I confronted Mr.S with this newfound information and he looked embarrassed…sweating/head down/apologising. He apologised for not being honest since the start. He explained the girl he was dating turned out to be a very topic person and even though they broke up a while ago, she wouldn’t stop telling people that they are still dating. 

Over the next few days.. He was still acting all nice, writing letters on post-it notes apologising for what he did. I had started to feel very uncomfortable and asked him to stop talking to me. He didn’t take me seriously and continued leaving chocolates at my desk, poems with his initials signed on it and of course the apology letters. I did not want to go to the HR over this so I get a final warning and took a few days off. 

The entire drama was weighing on me. I have been cheated on in my previous relationship and I didn’t want to be the ‘other girl’ in anyone else’s story. So I finally decided to contact ‘the girlfriend’ and I couldn’t believe what I heard. 
Mr.S and girlfriend have been high school sweethearts and planning to get married by the end of this year. Wedding preparations are on. Already booked a venue and everything. I felt like a fool, not contacting her sooner. I told her everything that has happened and showed her all the texts,call logs,poems,everything. She left crying in the middle of conversation. 

She contacted me later to let me know the wedding is off and has broken up with him. 
Mr.S  showed up drunk to my house the very same day… crying, telling me how much he loves me and how he was pressured into the marriage and would have not agreed to it, if I had dated him. It has been a week since that day and he looks miserable at work. My coworkers are also very withdrawn from me. I have started to feel very isolated. I don’t know if there was a better way to handle this. AITA here?

1lx0cjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FunFamous274/comments/1lx0cjn/top_10_café_furniture_manufacturers_in_india_you/,Top 10 Café Furniture Manufacturers in India You Should Know,"Hey folks,

If you're opening a cafe or revamping an old one, the biggest vibe factor is your **furniture**. I recently went down a rabbit hole researching **café furniture manufacturers in India**—not just the famous ones, but also the hidden gems that don't dominate Google search.

Here’s a list that might help anyone setting up a café, lounge, bistro, or a coffee spot. Let’s dive in:

# 🥇1. Best of Exports – Jodhpur, Rajasthan

**In my list, the number 1 Café Furniture Manufacturer in India is Best of Exports** – and for good reason. These guys are on another level. Super professional. They’ve completed over **1500+ café and restaurant furniture projects** across India, and they operate from a massive **1.15 lakh sq. ft. manufacturing facility**.

✅ ISO-certified quality  
✅ Customization options  
✅ Strong focus on design + durability  
✅ Great variety – cafe chairs, tables, booths, bar units, outdoor sets

If you want quality and project reliability, they’re the safest bet. Their craftsmanship has both traditional and modern café vibes—ideal if you're doing a rustic or minimalist setup.

# 2. Rustic Route Furniture – Indore, MP

A small furniture unit that specializes in industrial-style café furniture—iron-framed tables, wooden stools, reclaimed wood. No fancy website, but they’re active on WhatsApp. Known locally for handcrafted work and budget-friendly pricing.

# 3. Wooden Nest – Saharanpur, UP

A family-run workshop with a solid reputation in North India. They focus mainly on wooden café furniture—compact tables, stackable chairs, benches. Not very visible online, but they ship pan-India.

# 4. The Stool Studio – Surat, Gujarat

Tiny niche brand that just makes stools and small side tables. They supply to many boutique cafés and ice cream parlors. Most of their clients come from Instagram or word-of-mouth.

# 5. Urban Sawdust – Pune, Maharashtra

They blend recycled wood with powder-coated steel to create urban-industrial café pieces. Their production scale is small, but each item feels artisan-made. Friendly team. You’ll need to DM them directly for catalogs.

# 6. CoffeeCraze Furniture – Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu

As the name suggests, they mainly supply to cafes. Tables with cup-holders, book-shelves, quirky designs. Very local—most of their work happens within South India, but a few outlets in Delhi use them too.

# 7. Kala Woods – Jodhpur, Rajasthan

Not as big as Best of Exports, but Kala Woods has its own niche. They build basic wooden furniture—mostly pine and mango wood. Ideal if you’re doing a vintage or raw wood-themed cafe.

# 8. The Iron Leaf – Moradabad, UP

If you're into wrought iron cafe furniture (think French-style chairs, metal frame tables), these folks are worth checking out. No real website, but they supply to small cafés and home garden setups.

# 9. Chair & Chai – Ahmedabad, Gujarat

Cute name, but serious about design. This micro-manufacturer does funky café furniture—think odd-shaped chairs, pastel-painted tables, bar units with LED lighting. Their designs are popular in themed cafes.

# 10. Banyan Root Furniture – Kochi, Kerala

Mostly known for eco-conscious materials like bamboo, cane, and recycled wood. They’re into sustainable café furniture and local handmade stuff. Limited catalog, but perfect for earthy, boho-themed spaces.

# Final Thoughts:

If you want **professionalism, custom options, and guaranteed delivery**, go with **Best of Exports**—they’re hands down the best in the game right now.

But if you want to support smaller makers or do something unique and budget-friendly, the other 9 are underrated options. Just be ready for more legwork—most don’t have fancy websites or automated systems.

Hope this helps someone. And if you’ve worked with any of these or know more underrated café furniture suppliers, let’s share!",1,1752217620.0,u_FunFamous274,0,1.0,False

Your spine is truly amazing. It holds you upright, protects your spinal cord, and allows you to bend, twist, and move in countless ways. Yet most people don't think about their spine until it starts hurting. By then, damage might already be done.

After treating thousands of patients with back problems in Nagpur, our orthopedic team has noticed something important: most spine problems can be prevented with simple daily habits. Whether you're a student hunched over books, an office worker sitting at a desk, or someone who does physical labor, your spine needs daily care.

The good news? Keeping your spine healthy doesn't require expensive equipment or hours of exercise. It just needs smart choices throughout your day.

**Why Your Spine Deserves Daily Attention**

Your spine consists of 33 vertebrae stacked on top of each other like building blocks. Between each vertebra are soft cushions called discs that act like shock absorbers. When everything works together properly, you can move freely without pain.

But when you neglect your spine, problems start small and grow bigger. Poor posture compresses discs, weak muscles can't support your spine properly, and stress creates tension that pulls everything out of alignment.

Think of spine care like brushing your teeth. You wouldn't skip brushing for weeks and expect healthy teeth. Similarly, your spine needs daily attention to stay healthy and pain-free.

**1. Start Your Day with Spine-Friendly Morning Habits**

How you start your morning sets the tone for your entire day. These simple habits can keep your spine happy from the moment you wake up.

**Wake up gently:**

* Don't jump out of bed immediately
* Roll onto your side first, then push yourself up with your arms
* Sit on the edge of the bed for a moment before standing
* Do a few gentle stretches while still in bed

**Morning stretch routine (5 minutes):**

* Knee-to-chest pulls while lying down
* Gentle spinal twists
* Cat-cow stretches if you're comfortable on the floor
* Simple neck rolls

**Choose spine-friendly morning activities:**

* Take a warm shower to relax muscles
* Do light stretching while your coffee brews
* Walk around your house or garden
* Avoid heavy lifting first thing in the morning

**2. Master the Art of Good Posture**

Good posture isn't about standing like a soldier. It's about keeping your spine in its natural curves without strain or tension.

**Perfect sitting posture:**

* Keep your feet flat on the floor
* Your knees should be at hip level or slightly lower
* Sit back in your chair so your back is supported
* Keep your shoulders relaxed, not hunched forward
* Position your computer screen at eye level

**Standing posture tips:**

* Imagine a string pulling you up from the top of your head
* Keep your shoulders back but relaxed
* Engage your core muscles gently
* Distribute weight evenly on both feet
* Avoid locking your knees

**Walking posture:**

* Keep your head up and eyes forward
* Swing your arms naturally
* Take comfortable steps, not too long or short
* Land on your heel and roll through to your toes

**Common posture mistakes to avoid:**

* Slouching while watching TV
* Carrying heavy bags on one shoulder
* Sleeping on your stomach
* Looking down at your phone for long periods

**3. Create a Spine-Friendly Workspace**

Whether you work from home or in an office, your workspace setup can make or break your spine health.

**Desk setup essentials:**

* Adjust your chair height so your feet rest flat on the floor
* Position your monitor so the top of the screen is at eye level
* Keep your keyboard and mouse at elbow height
* Use a document holder to avoid neck strain
* Keep frequently used items within easy reach

**The 20-20-20 rule:** Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This gives your neck and eyes a break from computer work.

**Movement breaks:**

* Stand and walk for 2 minutes every hour
* Do desk stretches during phone calls
* Take stairs instead of elevators
* Walk to colleagues' desks instead of emailing

**If you work standing:**

* Use an anti-fatigue mat
* Alternate standing on one foot, then the other
* Keep one foot slightly elevated on a footrest
* Wear supportive shoes

**4. Exercise Your Spine Without Going to the Gym**

Your spine needs movement to stay healthy. The discs between your vertebrae get nutrition from movement, and your muscles need activity to stay strong.

**Simple spine exercises you can do at home:**

**Wall slides (for upper back):**

* Stand with your back against a wall
* Slowly slide up and down while keeping contact with the wall
* Do 10-15 repetitions

**Pelvic tilts (for lower back):**

* Lie on your back with knees bent
* Gently tilt your pelvis to flatten your lower back against the floor
* Hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times

**Bird dog (for core strength):**

* Start on hands and knees
* Extend opposite arm and leg
* Hold for 5 seconds, switch sides
* Do 10 repetitions each side

**Bridge pose (for glutes and core):**

* Lie on your back with knees bent
* Lift your hips off the ground
* Hold for 5 seconds, lower slowly
* Repeat 10-15 times

**Activities that are great for your spine:**

* Swimming (especially backstroke)
* Walking on flat surfaces
* Yoga or gentle stretching
* Tai chi for balance and flexibility

**5. Sleep Your Way to a Healthy Spine**

You spend about one-third of your life sleeping, so your sleep position and mattress choice have a huge impact on your spine health.

**Best sleeping positions:**

* **On your back:** Place a pillow under your knees to reduce lower back pressure
* **On your side:** Keep a pillow between your knees to maintain hip alignment
* **Avoid sleeping on your stomach:** This forces your neck into an unnatural position

**Mattress and pillow tips:**

* Choose a mattress that supports your spine's natural curves
* Replace your mattress every 7-10 years
* Use a pillow that keeps your neck aligned with your spine
* Side sleepers need thicker pillows, back sleepers need thinner ones

**Bedtime routine for spine health:**

* Do gentle stretches before bed
* Take a warm bath to relax muscles
* Avoid screens for an hour before sleep
* Keep your bedroom cool and comfortable

**6. Lift Smart, Not Hard**

Improper lifting causes many spine injuries. Whether you're picking up groceries or moving furniture, technique matters more than strength.

**Safe lifting technique:**

* Stand close to the object
* Bend your knees, not your back
* Keep your chest up and shoulders back
* Lift with your legs, not your back
* Keep the object close to your body
* Don't twist while lifting

**What not to lift:**

* Anything over 25% of your body weight (without help)
* Objects above your head
* Items while your back is already sore
* Things while you're tired or rushed

**Alternatives to heavy lifting:**

* Use a dolly or cart
* Ask for help
* Break heavy loads into smaller pieces
* Use proper lifting equipment

**7. Manage Stress to Reduce Spine Tension**

Stress doesn't just affect your mind - it creates physical tension in your muscles, especially around your neck and shoulders.

**How stress affects your spine:**

* Muscle tension pulls vertebrae out of alignment
* Stress hormones can increase inflammation
* Anxiety can make pain feel worse
* Poor sleep from stress doesn't give your spine time to heal

**Stress-reduction techniques:**

* Deep breathing exercises
* Progressive muscle relaxation
* Gentle yoga or meditation
* Regular exercise
* Spending time in nature
* Talking to friends or family

**When to seek help:** If stress is overwhelming your life and causing physical symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out to our healthcare team.

**8. Stay Hydrated for Healthy Discs**

Your spinal discs are about 80% water. When you're dehydrated, your discs can shrink and become less effective at cushioning your vertebrae.

**How much water to drink:**

* Aim for 8-10 glasses daily
* More if you exercise or live in a hot climate
* Start your day with a glass of water
* Keep a water bottle at your desk

**Signs you need more water:**

* Dark yellow urine
* Feeling stiff in the morning
* Frequent back pain
* Headaches or fatigue

**Foods that help with hydration:**

* Watermelon and cucumber
* Soups and broths
* Herbal teas
* Fresh fruits and vegetables

**9. Maintain a Healthy Weight**

Extra weight puts additional stress on your spine, especially your lower back. Even losing a few pounds can make a significant difference in how your back feels.

**How weight affects your spine:**

* Extra belly weight pulls your spine forward
* Additional pressure on spinal discs
* Increased inflammation throughout your body
* More stress on supporting muscles

**Healthy weight management:**

* Focus on whole foods, not processed foods
* Control portion sizes
* Stay active with activities you enjoy
* Don't try to lose weight too quickly
* Aim for 1-2 pounds per week

**Spine-friendly exercises for weight loss:**

* Walking or swimming
* Water aerobics
* Gentle yoga
* Resistance training with proper form

**10. Know When to Seek Professional Help**

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your spine needs professional attention. Don't ignore warning signs that could indicate serious problems.

**See a doctor immediately for:**

* Severe back pain after an injury
* Pain that shoots down your leg
* Numbness or tingling in your arms or legs
* Loss of bladder or bowel control
* Fever along with back pain
* Pain that gets worse despite rest

**Schedule an appointment soon for:**

* Persistent pain lasting more than a few days
* Morning stiffness that doesn't improve
* Pain that interferes with daily activities
* Recurring episodes of back pain
* Gradual loss of flexibility or range of motion

**Our comprehensive spine care includes:**

* Advanced diagnostic imaging
* Non-surgical treatment options
* Physical therapy guidance
* Minimally invasive procedures when needed
* 24x7 emergency care for spine emergencies

Like the coffee is better than the average coffee place for sure, where here at least you'd be lucky to even be able to stomach the coffee without drowning it in sugar, but I still often get disappointed. I have a local specialty place where I buy most of the coffee I use at home and sometimes they have the same beans ""on tap"" that they are selling. I tried their espresso of an Ugandan coffee I bought from them before and imo my coffee tasted much better. I use a different technique (mokapot, based on James' technique) so it's not directly comparable but I feel like it could have been done better. The other week I was in another place and I feel the espresso they served me was definitely underextracted. Again, not undrinkably so, but still definitely not how you'd expect it to be from a competent place.

Anyone else feel like this? Maybe it's because here (Italy) specialty coffee is a niche and there's not much competition? Is it better where you live, or have you felt this before?",11,1752217416.0,JamesHoffmann,9,0.87,False
1lx08x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1lx08x0/my_doctor_thinks_its_an_ok_idea_to_disrupt_the/,"My doctor thinks it's an OK idea to disrupt the past 7 years of stable life I've had by changing my regimen because ""we should review it"".","Slight backstory here: I've had both epilepsy and ADHD my entire life. I'm lucky enough that my seizures can not only be controlled with lamictal, but controlled so well that I can take vyvanse and coffee on top of it without risking seizures - which is great, because for the past 7 years I have completed my college degree, gotten married, held two stable jobs for 3+ years (still working one of them, left the last one voluntarily for this one), moved to another city, *bought a house*, and my future career path is all laid out in front of me. I've been feeling INCREDIBLE and it's a massive shift from before that 7-year mark where I scraped by in high school with a 2.6 GPA, dropped out of college 1 year in, couldn't hold on to any jobs for more than 6 months, was living with my parents, and never managed a relationship that lasted longer than 3 months. For most of my life it has been a struggle to maintain enough focus to get anything done, a struggle to retain memories/mental coherency (because of seizures) or both. I got my seizures under control 10 years ago, but still wasn't really able to get decent grades in college, and was diagnosed with ADHD 3 years later - at which point my neurologist warned me of the danger but still signed off on a subscription for vyvanse. I have been taking it for the past 7 years, and not once has it led to seizures.

So, in any sense, I have a PCP, but the doctor who started the clinic retired last month, and the doctor who came on-board had me come in for an appointment. Reasonable enough. I go in, he asks me about my history, and then says ""so you take vyvanse...which is a stimulant, which is bad for people with epilepsy"". I highlight the fact that it hasn't led to seizures, and he points out that if I do start having more, it's the first thing to cut - to which I agree.

He then asks me ""so what's your plan?"" and I tell him ""uhh, well, continue my stable career path, develop further, improve my house, enjoy the stability I've managed to construct - what do you mean?"" to which he responds ""well, we should probably continue to evaluate things."" I can't help but sarcastically state ""wait, ADHD is curable? Epilepsy is curable?! This is news to me, tell me more!"" which...he doesn't find amusing. Apparently he thinks that it's not enough to accept the last 34 years of my life as evidence for whether or not this regimen is a good idea. Apparently changing what isn't broken is a good idea.

Long story short, he wants me to talk to a psychiatrist (and said he'd set up a referral) because he's not confident in his own ability as a doctor to provide care here and is worrying about liability, but doesn't want to say that in words. I agreed, he said he'd fill my meds, *and then he didn't.* I had to call repeatedly (over multiple days) and send in messages through their web portal before I finally got ahold of someone who poked him in person. I asked him if he was actually just planning on waiting until the psych appointments had happened but of course he didn't answer that. He DID finally refill it, but doesn't seem to understand what his actions are doing to me, and I have zero confidence in him actually providing meaningful care.

Anyways, I've been kinda freaking out here because I've built up *so much* on this foundation of stability, and this doctor is just holding the threat of disrupting it over my head without seeming to acknowledge that maybe, *just maybe*, there's something to be learned from 7 years of stability preceded by 27 years of instability - perhaps maybe that the system defining those 7 years *should be kept in place* instead of being fucked with! I feel I can PROBABLY keep shit together without vyvanse, but like...so much of my life was governed by instability, and some of my seizures were induced by how instability led to extreme stress. Raw anxiety has proven itself to be a far larger trigger than vyvanse, coffee, or any other stimulant has. I worry that if things fall apart, it's going to form a recursive cycle that hurts me, my wife, my friend that I bought this house with, and his wife, and do irreparable harm in ways that go beyond words.

I've heard stories from y'all about doctors that are stupid about medications. How do you stay sane in the face of that danger? It feels like I'm on railroad tracks and my previous doctors would pull the lever to send the oncoming train onto different rails, and now this doctor is looking at the lever and saying ""hmm, do I really NEED to pull this lever?"" while staring me in the eye.",4,1752217254.0,Epilepsy,2,1.0,False

Next time I was to travel for work, I grabbed the keys to the company car, a crusty old Ford Focus with 170k miles, held together by zip ties and corporate optimism. Barely any AC, brakes squealed like a banshee, and it reeked of stale coffee and despair.

About an hour into my 3 hour drive to a client, I hear a loud clunk. Then smoke. Then the car just dies. On a remote highway. No signal. I end up walking nearly two miles to get a bar of service and call for a tow. Client meeting? Missed. The company had to reschedule, reimburse the client for the inconvenience, and cover the tow and repairs.
Manager wasn’t pleased. I reminded him I had offered to take my own car because I trusted it. After that, the mandatory company car rule got quietly retired, and I never heard about it again.",45,1752217179.0,MaliciousCompliance,8,0.82,False

# Chapter 1

My brother had hated me for seven years.

The last time we argued, I stormed out during a downpour, furious and reckless. I ended up falling into a river, and when I woke up, my memory was a mess.

At the hospital, he looked relieved—like a weight had finally been lifted. He pointed casually at a terminally ill patient and said, ""That's your real brother.

""Get it straight. Don't bother me again.""

The pale-faced man walked over, gently stroked my head, and said softly, ""Come on, I'll take you home.""

After that, I went to great lengths to save this so-called ""brother."" I braved a snowstorm to find a specialist, stayed up countless nights to watch over him.

I even risked my own life for him.

Then, one day, my real brother stood in the freezing snow and blocked my path, his voice shaking in panic.

""You really… don't remember me?""

The doctors had warned of memory confusion. I'd just woken up in the hospital.

Falling from such a height into the river had given me a severe concussion. I'd been in a coma for over two weeks.

Two weeks ago, I had a huge fight with my brother, Charley Lyons.

Right before slamming the door behind me, I shouted, ""I'd rather die than have you clean up after me!""

His face twisted in fury, and behind me I heard his cold, mocking laugh.

""Then I hope you get your wish.""

But now, two weeks had passed—and I was still alive.

When I opened my eyes, the soft winter sunlight streamed through the hospital window.

It took a while for my vision to clear, and then I started to hear things.

Outside the room, I could make out the voices of the doctor and Charley.

""Trauma to the head, extended coma—

""memory loss or confusion is very likely,"" the doctor said.

""It's not just about forgetting friends and family. In some cases, they forget who they are entirely…""

I forced myself out of bed, wanting to explain that my memory was fine.

I hated hospitals.

I didn't want this diagnosis to become another reason to keep me trapped here.

Just as I reached the door, I heard Charley's low voice.

There was something in it—cold, yes, but also strangely pleased.

""This might actually be for the best,"" he said.

As if trying to prove the doctor's point, he added, ""She woke up briefly last night, looked at me, and asked who I was.""

He wasn't lying. I vaguely remembered that moment.

But I'd only asked because I wasn't fully conscious, and everything had been a blur—I couldn't even make out his face.

My hand froze on the doorknob.

The doctor tried to offer reassurance.

""There's no need to jump to conclusions. We'll know more once your sister wakes up.

""And even if there is memory loss, we can work on recovery…""

But Charley cut him off.

""No. It's better if she forgets. Don't try to bring it back.""

I could even hear the trace of joy he didn't bother to hide.

So that's what he really wanted? For me to forget him?

After everything… after all the fights since Mom and Dad passed… he's the only family I have left.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

But now that I'd survived, I just wanted one more chance to talk to him.

I pulled open the door.

Our eyes met—his filled with surprise, then quickly turning cold and distant.

I'd been unconscious too long.

When I spoke, my voice was hoarse, ""I actually…""

Charley's brows knit together, disbelief flashing across his face.

But then, almost like trying to convince himself, he made up his mind.

He assumed I was confused—mistaking someone else for him.

In the hallway, people came and went, oblivious.

It was like he couldn't wait to get rid of me. Without even looking, Charley reached out, pointed randomly at a patient walking by, and said, ""That's your brother.""

For a moment, I thought I must have misheard him.

I stared at him, stunned. ""What?""

Something flickered in his eyes—hesitation, maybe even guilt—but it vanished almost instantly.

We'd been siblings for over twenty years.

No matter how much he hated or resented me, I couldn't believe he'd push me toward a total stranger while I was still bruised, broken, and barely back on my feet.

Right then, I thought—maybe we really needed to talk. Really talk.

I opened my mouth, ready to put the bitterness behind me.

But he cut in again, his tone sharp and final, ""I said, that's your brother.

""Don't call the wrong person again. And stop coming to me.""

This time, he'd made up his mind.

When he motioned again to the man who had stopped nearby, his face showed no trace of doubt—just cold determination.

The doctor had already slipped away, probably not wanting to get involved.

People flowed through the hallway, slowing down to glance at me—curious, uncomfortable.

To them, I probably looked like a girl who'd gone off the deep end after nearly drowning—so out of it I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

The man Charley pointed to stood quietly across the hall, leaning against the wall.

Tall, well-built, with striking features—but pale. Deathly pale.

Anyone else would've been angry to be dragged into something like this.

But he wasn't. He simply looked at Charley, then at me. Calm. Silent.

Like he was waiting to see what would happen next.

Charley spoke again, voice colder than ever, ""I'm just a friend of your brother's. I came to check in out of politeness.

""If you want to talk to him, go find him yourself. Whether he accepts you or not—that's up to you two.""

And with that, he turned and walked down the hall, never looking back.

My hand, hanging at my side, started to tremble.

I kept telling myself—it's fine. He's hated me for years. This shouldn't be a surprise.

So what if I lost a brother who never wanted me? It's not like we ever really got along anyway.

But my eyes still burned, and I couldn't stop the tears from rising.

Shock. Shame. Anger. Frustration.

The emotions crashed into each other until I couldn't even form a single word.

I watched him walk away, the world tilting slightly as I grabbed the doorframe to steady myself.

A loud ringing filled my ears. For a long time, I couldn't pull myself back together.

Then, the man who had been silently watching finally moved.

He let go of the wall and slowly walked toward me.

For a second, I thought he might come over and scold me—accuse me of faking, of making a scene.

Now that Charley had left, I was the only one left to blame.

I instinctively tried to take a step back.

But maybe I'd been in bed too long. Maybe my emotions had drained every last bit of strength.

My body didn't move.

Then, before I could even process what was happening—

A hand gently landed on my head.

At first, it felt almost like a scolding tap—but there was no force behind it.

Just a soft, almost tentative touch. A pat.

It was a long moment before he finally spoke.

His voice was tired, but gentle. ""Come on. Let's go. I'll take you home.""

How many years had it been since Charley last called himself my brother?

Too long. So long I'd forgotten what it felt like.

I looked up at him, dazed.

We'd been fighting for years.

Ever since our parents died.

Maybe I really had gone crazy.

Because I stared at this complete stranger—a man I'd never seen before in my life—and still, I nodded.

""Okay.""

# Chapter 2

I followed a stranger back to a home I'd never seen before.

The place was spotless—so clean, it felt cold. Lifeless.

Not a speck of dust anywhere. No signs of anyone actually living there.

It reminded me of him—his pale, expressionless face. Too still. Too quiet.

Years ago, a place like this might've scared me. But now, life or death didn't matter much to me anymore. There was nothing left that I'm afraid of.

I glanced around the room. On the coffee table were several small white pill bottles. I recognized them instantly—they were the same kind I'd once tried to collect.

But doctors were always cautious.

No matter what excuse I gave—stress, insomnia, anxiety—they never gave me more than a few at a time.

I'd spent six months saving them up and still barely managed to get a dozen.

Now, looking at all those full bottles, I almost laughed.

And surprisingly, I felt a flicker of envy.

That many pills… more than enough to die.

Next to the bottles sat a photo.

It was strange—black and white, about a foot wide.

The man in the picture looked straight into the camera. Calm. Blank. Completely emotionless.

It stood out so much I couldn't help but stare.

Then I glanced at the man standing beside me—his face practically a mirror of the one in the photo. Same expression. Same stillness.

Even after he saw me notice the pills and the photo, his face didn't change.

Without a word, he calmly walked over, gathered them up, and tucked everything into a drawer.

Then he turned to me and said gently, ""Sit down. I'll make you something to eat.""

So he really believed it. He thought my head was so messed up I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

That thought pulled me back to reality.

Lying to someone already standing on the edge—it didn't sit right with me.

I wanted to tell him the truth. Then leave.

But the image of that photo, those pills… they stayed with me.

And suddenly, I was curious. What had he been through that pushed him so close to the edge? Just like me?

Where did he even get that many pills?

Before I knew it, I'd sat down.

He went into the kitchen. Said he was going to cook. But for a long time, I didn't hear a thing.

I got up and walked to the kitchen door.

He was standing there, staring blankly into the open fridge.

It was as empty as the rest of the apartment.

Not a single ingredient. Not even a bottle of water.

Clearly, no one had cooked here in a long time.

The stovetop was bare—no pots or pans, just a single ceramic jar. The kind used for boiling medicine.

He stood there for a while before finally snapping out of it.

He shut the fridge and turned to look at me.

His voice was soft, almost apologetic. ""Sorry. I forgot to buy groceries. I'll go out and get something.""

Over the years, I'd looked at myself in the mirror and thought, I'm alive, but I don't feel it. Like I've become some hollow soul, floating outside my own body.

But standing there in that kitchen, I realized—

There was someone else out there who looked even more like the dead than I did.

He walked past me and headed toward the door.

And I realized—I couldn't hear his footsteps. Couldn't even hear him breathe.

It suddenly occurred to me—maybe this stranger, someone I'd just met today, wasn't planning on coming back.

Just like that night… after my fight with Charley. When I fell into the river.

Charley and the doctors had both insisted it was an accident—that the rain was too heavy, the bridge too slick.

That I'd slipped.

But I knew better.

He was already at the entryway, hand on the door, just about to step out.

I looked at his back and said, without thinking, ""I like fish.""

He froze.

Stiffened slightly, then slowly turned to face me.

His expression unchanged—calm, pale, unreadable. ""What?"" he asked.

I met his gaze and repeated, ""I said, I want fish.

""For dinner. Can you make that for me?""

The front door was still ajar.

Cold wind blew in—late autumn, almost winter.

It rushed through the apartment, tugging at the hem of his coat and messing up his already disheveled hair.

Against the wind, his face looked even more bloodless. Almost ghost-like.

His fingers, hanging by his side, gave the slightest twitch.

After a long pause, he nodded. ""Okay.""

I watched him walk out. The door clicked shut behind him.

Maybe—just maybe—he'd actually come back.

The thought made me laugh at myself.

I was someone who'd been ready to end it all.

And yet here I was… worrying about whether a stranger might not return.

I sank back into the couch and closed my eyes. The same images came rushing back.

My parents—who should've been alive and well—crushed beneath the rubble.

And me, pulled out alive, surviving by stepping over the lives of the two people who loved me most.

The scene shifted—Charley's face filled with rage, his voice sharp and bitter.

""Erma, you're the one who should've died. That would've been justice.""

""After all these years, do you really sleep with a clear conscience?""

No. I didn't.

That was why I hadn't had a single night of real rest in years.

I slipped into a nightmare again—and it took a while to drag myself back out.

When I opened my eyes, they landed on the closed drawer beneath the coffee table.

My hand moved before I could think. I slid the drawer open, reached inside, and pulled out the pill bottles.

I'd never stolen anything in my life. The moment my fingers closed around one of them, my palms were instantly damp with sweat.

But I'd done my homework. I knew the dosage.

If I took half and left the rest for him—well, that'd be enough for both of us to disappear.

My thoughts were hazy. I told myself this was reasonable. Fair.

My fingers trembled as I unscrewed the cap of the first bottle.

Then, out of nowhere, the phone on the coffee table rang.

The sound tore through the silence like a gunshot.

I jumped, nearly dropping the bottle.

My heart thudded.

Guiltily, I set the pills down and grabbed the phone.

I hit ""Answer"" before realizing—it wasn't mine.

He must've forgotten it when he left.

The call connected.

And immediately, a furious voice exploded through the line.

""Listen to me, Nolan—over 200 million dollars! You really think you can walk away without giving me a dime? Not a chance!

""I might not have raised you, but I sure as hell gave birth to you!

""That little sister of yours died for you—and as your father, I have every right to inherit from a dying son!

""Donate it all? Keep dreaming!""

# Chapter 3

I hadn't meant to listen in on someone's private conversation.

But the voice on the other end of the line had been so loud, so agitated, and so fast that by the time I snapped out of it and hurried to hang up, I'd already heard more than I should have.

A slip of paper had fallen onto the carpet.

It must've come out when I'd fumbled with the drawer earlier, grabbing the pill bottles.

It was a diagnosis report—late-stage heart failure. The patient's name: Nolan Diaz.

The name struck a chord. It was the same one the man on the phone had been shouting about.

I thought for a moment before it came to me—something I'd seen trending not long ago.

Nolan, founder and CEO of Nolan Tech, had suddenly announced plans to sell the company, even though it was booming.

The timing made no sense. Selling now would mean taking a loss.

I remembered the news coverage—reporters swarming him, and him standing there with that same expression he wore now: calm, vacant, lifeless.

He'd said only one thing, ""I'm tired. I just want to rest.""

So it was him.

And the reason he wanted to die… was because he was dying.

Funny, how life worked.

Some people were perfectly healthy and still wanted to die. Others, even with everything going for them, got hit with a terminal diagnosis.

I picked up the paper carefully and tucked it back into the drawer with the pill bottles.

Stealing medication from someone with a terminal illness…

Even if I made it to hell, I'd probably still get spat on by the devil himself.

Outside, dusk was falling, and rain had started to fall in steady sheets.

It beat against the floor-to-ceiling windows, tapping louder and harder as the last traces of daylight disappeared.

Still no sign of him at the door.

He… didn't actually die out there, did he?

I sighed.

After a moment of internal debate, I stood up and stepped outside.

His car was still in the front yard. He must've left on foot.

And without his phone, he wouldn't have been able to call a ride—not until he got out of the neighborhood, anyway.

Maybe he hadn't gone far.

I grabbed an umbrella and headed out, walking through the rain and past the gates of the villa complex.

Then I hailed a cab and asked the driver to take me to the nearest mall.

Honestly, I doubted he was really out buying fish this late.

But I still wanted to look for him.

It was cold, and the mall was quieter than usual. Fewer people than normal.

I checked each floor, scanning every aisle, but didn't see him anywhere.

Just as I was about to give up and try a different mall—

A sharp, cold voice sounded behind me, ""Who told you to follow me here?""

Charley.

I turned around. He was standing not far away, face tight with irritation, staring straight at me.

Standing next to Charley was Elsie Palmer, the daughter of a CEO he'd recently partnered with on a big project.

He'd gone to close a business deal and conveniently picked up a new ""goddaughter"" along the way.

The CEO praised him endlessly—called him warm, generous, kind-hearted. But only I knew the truth. He'd never been the warm-hearted type.

He just didn't like me, his real sister.

It felt like my heart had been dropped in ice water—heavy, aching, and tight.

I'd spent years trying to get used to it.

The brother who used to dote on me, protect me, give in to my every whim...

Had turned into someone who couldn't look at me without disgust. Every word he spoke was sharp, cold, and full of contempt.

And yet, no matter how much time passed, I could never truly get used to it. Never really stop caring.

It took me a moment to push the feelings down.

I tightened my grip on the umbrella, forced myself to meet his eyes, and said as calmly as I could, ""I wasn't following you. I… came to find someone.""

His eyes darkened, voice full of suspicion and anger. ""You've never once come to this part of town.

""If you weren't tailing me, who else would you be looking for?""

Just as he said that, I spotted a familiar figure behind him.

I couldn't clearly remember Nolan's face. It was still a blur in my mind.

But a face that pale, that still, that dead-looking—there couldn't be another one like it.

He was standing at a distance. Not close, but not far either.

He didn't move forward. Just stood there, watching me.

Like he preferred it this way—keeping some space, quietly observing.

Charley frowned when I didn't respond and snapped again, ""I'm talking to you.

""Stop creeping around and following me. I'm not your brother. Get that through your head.""

Nolan stood there holding a plastic bag.

Through the clear plastic, I could see a cleaned, freshly prepared fish inside.

He'd actually bought it. After being gone for over three hours, he really came back—with the fish.

And just like that, a memory surfaced—uninvited.

Years ago, I'd thrown a fit late one night, begging Charley for cake from that bakery on the far side of town.

He'd scolded me, said eating sweets that late would rot my teeth.

Plus, it was way past closing time.

I sulked and went to bed angry. But in the middle of the night, he came back, cold all over, sneaking into my room so our parents wouldn't wake up.

He pulled the cake out from inside his coat—it was still warm.

And with a stern face, he told me, ""This is the last time.""

But somehow… there was always another ""last time.""

I snapped back to reality and looked at the fish again.

Then, unexpectedly, I let out a quiet laugh.

Charley stared at me like he'd just seen a ghost.

He followed my gaze, and when he turned to see Nolan standing there, his face twisted in shock and anger.

""Why the hell is that guy still here?""

I finally pulled my eyes away from the fish and gave him my answer.

""I didn't come for you. I came to find my brother.""",1,1752216995.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Event FAQ [https://www.indopreneur.co.nz/faqs-1](https://www.indopreneur.co.nz/faqs-1)

There is an assortment of stalls, more than just food. I am just listing those that have food. Not all are halal. Some I did list what was there but others I didn't because it took too long.

\* Akira's BBQ (Filipino like pork sisig, Lechon, pork bbq, pork + mushroom siomai, dinuguan )

\* Arita halal sushi

\* Buah  (drinks: lychee tea. lychee yakult. Fried rice, fried bakmi, fried kwetiau,  strawberry choco-dip),

\* Dapur Aji,

\* Fluffy Crepes - Risoles, pastel, spring roll, Indonesian crepes called murtabak

\* Indo Kai Kitchen Street Food (Halal ramen, ebi furai, fried gyoza, fried chicken),

\* Jhasmine's Kitchen,

\* Kedai Avondale

\* Kids with Athritis NZ (tasty treats like cupcakes, candy floss),

\* Jahe NZ (Ginger milk),

\* Laris Manis,

\* MyHomeFood (looks like assorted prepacked ingredients and snacks like rendang padang seasoning mix. organic brown sugar from areca palm nectar, halal nuts, keripik tempe),

\* Pang & Lee Catering (was SIngapore Takeaway in Papakura)

\* Pempek NZ,

\* Warung Emak,

\* Warung Kita (Chicken Geprek, Chicken Risol, salted egg chicken, fried siomay),

\* Warung KP,

\* Warung Zahra,

Notes on some Indonesian words used in the stall names:

\* Indonesian is a Malay language. Like many other languages there are local variants. Same with indonesian food.

\* In Indonesian a warung is a small family owned business. It could be a shop, an eatery or even just a stall.  So Warung Emak is ""Mum's Shop"" or ""Mum's Stall"". Warung Kita is ""Our Shop"".

\* Kedai is a malay word for shop. Kedai kopi is coffee shop, kedai runcit is a small grocery shop like our corner dairy.

\* Buah is fruit, Dapur is a kitchen. Manis is sweet.

\* Indonesian Martabak is different from Malaysian murtabak. Indonesian martabak is a thick pancake with a chewy texture.  It is often sweet though there are savoury versions.",8,1752216340.0,aucklandeats,5,0.89,False

After a 6months of usage PID controller suddenly stopped turning on. I found out that the casing of this part is broken, so two parts of the case do not lock together anymore. Upon experimenting a bit, the two parts of this thing has a metal inside and if I touch them everything works perfectly. 

But my assumption is:
If these two sides would be connected directly it would be just a wire and would not need a complex structure with a casing and spring, right?

But as I am bulking now, taking weight gainer shakes ( not readymade) , I mix protein oats bananas in it and drink for my bulk , so my stomach also stays a little upset sometimes , is it the problem or the gym air is the problem , I don't get it.... 

This vomiting feeling mainly happens with me on leg days, also sometimes upper body also when I have taken heavy food before my gym...but today I didn't take any food too, only drank coffee still this happened.

1lwzw9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1lwzw9e/okay_srsly_does_she_actually_like_me_im_so/,Okay srsly does she actually like me? I'm so confused.,"Ok I'll give the whole rundown of the situation, so everything's as accurate as possible.

I, 17F (*trans MtF...*) have a huge crush on a girl in my Year 12 English ATAR class (she's in my Chemistry class too, but I sit right next to her in Eng - I'm so worried about the teacher changing the seating plan this term lol, which will ruin everything...). I actually don't really enjoy the class, but I look forward to it every day because she just makes me so happy.

She always waves and looks happy to see me, and in a different way to her other friends, and every time she passes me, she'll call out to me like, 'Hi \_\_\_!!!', which earns me weird looks from whoever she's talking to lol, but makes me so happy.

She tells me random things in class, like, 'I'm so sleepy' for no reason other than to get my attention, and she kinda leans into me a little sometimes.

Last time we had an experiment in chemistry, she held the paper towel dispenser open (it's *very* fiddly...) while I put the new pack of paper towels in, and she came and made a point of standing next to me when we went to watch the teacher demonstrate the next part of the experiment. She also brushes my shoulder and/or says hi when she walks past my desk to put her name on our teacher's 'HELP ME' list on the whiteboard, and grins when I look startled.

She brushes my hand deliberately when I pass something to her, but I usually try to cover my hands around her because they're too big and I'm self-conscious about how they look (so glad our Yr 12 Leavers' Jackets have big, long sleeves lol), but she told me they look fine, even though they really don't... she always asks me first if I have a particular thing she needs, before asking anyone else (and I hate when I don't have scissors or wtv on me because I'm like, BUT I COULD HAVE and she would've appreciated it...).

She always draws me into conversations with her friends even if it's not *really* necessary for me to be a part of them, and I get along with them all very well too.

On our 'Year 12 Leadership Retreat' (i.e. camp), we were required to write nice things about people on pieces of paper and put them in envelopes with their names on them, and she wrote this beautiful thing on mine telling me that I'm amazing the way I am, and that I should never let anyone tell me any different. It wasn't anything really generic, like most of the stuff people wrote to others, which made me feel like she at least *thought* about me, and it made that last day when we got the letters so much better (we could leave them anonymous, too, so I appreciate that she signed off with her name!)

She actually shows an interest in the things I do, and tells me how I write so well in English, reminds me that I'm not as dumb as I think, etc. She actually pays attention to things I say, and remembers them for later too.

She's only dated guys in the past, which is the main part I'm worried about (like, I'm really hoping she's bi or was only dating those guys to feel 'normal'), but (after I came out to her), she told me (a week later) that she broke up with her boyfriend, and I helped her get over him (I never actually properly met him - he doesn't go to our school - but one time I ran into her when she was out with him, and I got the general idea of what he was like (he was an absolute asshole (got all protective and controlling when I was talking to her) - which I did say to her face when she broke up with him in an effort to make her feel better - IT WORKED), and it's strange that she would just randomly (with no prior part to the conversation causing her relationship status to come up) tell me that she's no longer dating this guy, and kinda just left that hanging.  
I did kinda connect the dots on that and go, 'wait... I told her I'm a girl, and a week later she breaks up with this guy because she doesn't actually like him really, and then kinda ominously tells me that she's now single...' and then I went 'no that's ridiculous it actually means nothing'

I asked her out for coffee/lunch casually, and she told me that she can't because she has to study for UCAT (which is literally like the most valid reason ever - that test is notoriously an actual *nightmare*), but she immediately stated she'd actually love to, but we'd have to do it another time, and I told her that I was sorry and it was unfair of me to put that on her just then, and she told me no it's ok and that she really wants to, and I wished her luck and told her not to just try and fit me into her schedule because she has other important things to do that take priority.

1lwzvvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1lwzvvu/hopeful_maybe/,Hopeful maybe,"My partner (35HLM) and I (32LLF) have been together for ten years. The first 2 years were absolutely incredible sex-wise. He was the first man to give me an orgasm. He's generous, slightly kinky, and the cherry on top, gorgeous.

Then, we both ""took turns"" dealing with major depression for several years. Between the depression in itself and the meds side-effects, our sex life became non existant. At that point in our lives we were satisfied with the companionship and had both such low libido, we talked about it and the DB didn't bother us much.

About 4 years ago, we opened our relationship to other emotional (and consequently sexual) relationships. It kickstarted back both our libidos. However, me having sex with my other partner helped me define what I like more clearly (definitely more vanilla, especially at the start of the sexy times). At the same time, knowing he had amazing chemistry with his other partner made me feel insecure, worried I couldn't please him ""as well"" or give him what he wanted on the kink front. We still weren't having sex. Maybe 3 times a year.

Then, she broke up with him and I became his only sexual partner again. I felt immense pressure to be good enough, not bore him, give him what he likes. It became full on performance anxiety. I'm an avoidant. When something makes me anxious, I shut down. So I did. Still only 3-4 times a year for years. And felt so, so frustrated and guilty for not being able to just ""put my brain on a shelf"" and do it. (And also feeling very very guilty about my other partner and I doing so well on that front.) He also told me he gets easily bored doing the same things every time, and I don't, so I'm always anxious about him getting bored and loosing interest.

We are both miserable because we both want that intimacy back. Nothing helped. Him not pressuring me, us talking about it, me going to therapy, couples therapy, nothing. Everytime he or I initiated, I would quickly freeze and panick. It doesn't help that he has hyposensibility so struggles to ""feel"" anything physically, and it takes him a long time to achieve orgasm. Makes me feel inadequate and like a shitty lover, even though I know that's not the issue.

A few days ago, he came to snuggle when I woke up, and told me he wanted me. I did too, but if you know me you know I'm barely a human being before my coffee lol. So I told him I'd get back to him after his 10am meeting (he works from home). Drank my coffee, took my meds. And then I had the lightbulb moment. I took a xanax. It kicked in at 9:30. Meeting done, and I just jumped into his arm and we had a really good time. Not the best sex ever, but no performance anxiety on my part.

So I think in the near future I'll just pop one of these bad boys before sex, and enjoy stress-free lovemaking with the love of my life. Then after a while my confidence might come back and I won't need it anymore. Kind of like men with ED who take viagra for a while to get their confidence back and then don't need it anymore?

Anyway. I'm cautiously optimistic.",1,1752215861.0,DeadBedrooms,3,1.0,False

My first job, I’ve been at for a year now, and I waitress at a steakhouse. The money is great, and the people I work with are awesome. I look forward into going to work. I’m also a full time grad student, and I would drive back home to waitress on the weekends. Fast forward to this summer- I moved back home and I’m serving breakfast at another restaurant. I worked with these people before when I was in high school, and I remember there was a lot of drama. Before I started this summer, I was so anxious and I think intuitively I knew. Long story short- my first day, the cook called me the n word (I’m not Black) and I told him that wasn’t appropriate and he then he called me it a few more times. I told him I was uncomfortable and he stopped. My boss (who also serves with me) is making me very anxious and I’ll list a few reasons of examples: one day I told her I had to be out by 1:30 for my other job (we’re usually done by then anyways) and she sternly told me that that is unacceptable and I need to focus at the job I’m at. I told her i understand but I take what hours I can get at my other job and I will need to be out by then. She said I committed to this job. The rest of the shift she glared at me and ignored me. The next shift- her daughter and her talked about me in the kitchen. That same shift I had a 1-top and I wasn’t sure if the that food was up was mine- and she sassily made a comment how I’m the only one who gets food pushed up (and she then swore at the cook and walked out). Last weekend they yelled so bad at the busser he couldn’t stop crying. Today- she left me with no host or busser (I didn’t know that) and she came in when I had 5 tables sitting, with food up, and still needing to get 2 tables drinks and orders. she asked what she could to do help with a coffee I had on the counter and I asked if she could coffee the floor and she started talking to me like a baby and was like “no I mean this coffee” and held up the mug in her hand. It’s hard to explain it all on text but…basically I’m so anxious before my shifts I can’t sleep. I told her I was done first week of August but I can’t last till then. Today at her other job two people put there two weeks in and she kept talking poorly about them (they’re just kids too).

Having a baby is one of life's most beautiful experiences. As expectant mothers in Nagpur, you want to make sure you're doing everything right for your little one. After helping thousands of families through their pregnancy journeys, our medical team has put together these ten practical tips that really make a difference.

**1. Start Your Day Right with Proper Nutrition**

Good food is like fuel for both you and your growing baby. Think of your meals as building blocks - each healthy choice helps create a strong foundation for your child's development.

**What works best:**

* Fresh fruits like oranges, apples, and bananas give you natural energy
* Green vegetables such as spinach and methi provide iron your body needs
* Whole grains like brown rice and wheat rotis keep you full longer
* Dairy products like milk and yogurt strengthen your baby's bones

**What to avoid:**

* Raw or undercooked meat and eggs
* Too much caffeine (limit to one cup of tea or coffee daily)
* Processed foods with lots of preservatives

Our nutritionists at the hospital often tell expecting mothers: ""Eat the rainbow!"" This means including colorful fruits and vegetables in every meal.

**2. Stay Active with Safe Exercises**

Many women worry that exercise might harm their baby, but gentle movement actually helps both of you stay healthy. Think of it as preparing your body for the marathon of childbirth.

**Safe activities include:**

* Walking for 20-30 minutes daily
* Swimming (if you know how to swim)
* Prenatal yoga classes
* Light stretching exercises

**Remember:** Always check with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine. Every pregnancy is different, and what works for your friend might not be right for you.

**3. Never Skip Your Doctor Visits**

Regular checkups are like having a roadmap for your pregnancy journey. These visits help catch any problems early and give you peace of mind.

**Typical visit schedule:**

* First trimester: Once a month
* Second trimester: Every two weeks
* Third trimester: Weekly visits

During these visits, your doctor will check your baby's heartbeat, measure your belly, and answer all your questions. Don't feel shy about asking anything - no question is too small when it comes to your baby's health.

**Need to schedule an appointment?** 📞 Call us at: 07124071454 📱 WhatsApp: 8668289254

**4. Get Plenty of Quality Sleep**

Your body is working extra hard to grow a human being, so it needs more rest than usual. Good sleep helps your baby develop properly and keeps your energy levels up.

**Sleep tips that work:**

* Go to bed at the same time every night
* Sleep on your left side to improve blood flow to your baby
* Use extra pillows to support your growing belly
* Keep your bedroom cool and dark

**If you're having trouble sleeping:**

* Try a warm bath before bed
* Avoid screens for an hour before sleeping
* Do some gentle stretching or reading

**5. Take Your Vitamins Seriously**

Even with the best diet, it's hard to get all the nutrients you and your baby need from food alone. Prenatal vitamins fill in these gaps.

**Key vitamins for pregnancy:**

* **Folic acid** prevents birth defects in your baby's brain and spine
* **Iron** prevents anemia and helps carry oxygen to your baby
* **Calcium** builds strong bones and teeth
* **Vitamin D** helps your body absorb calcium

Always take vitamins prescribed by your doctor. Over-the-counter vitamins might not have the right amounts for pregnant women.

**6. Stay Hydrated Throughout the Day**

Water does amazing things during pregnancy. It helps form your baby's amniotic fluid, carries nutrients through your body, and prevents common problems like constipation and urinary tract infections.

**How much to drink:**

* Aim for 8-10 glasses of water daily
* Increase this amount if you're active or it's hot outside
* Fresh coconut water is also excellent for hydration

**Signs you need more water:**

* Dark yellow urine
* Feeling dizzy or lightheaded
* Dry mouth or lips

**7. Manage Stress for Better Health**

Pregnancy brings many changes, and it's normal to feel worried sometimes. However, too much stress can affect your health and your baby's development.

**Stress-busting techniques:**

* Deep breathing exercises (try the 4-7-8 method)
* Gentle meditation or prayer
* Talking to family and friends about your feelings
* Joining pregnancy support groups

**When to seek help:** If you feel sad, anxious, or overwhelmed most days, talk to your doctor. Many women experience mood changes during pregnancy, and help is available.

**8. Avoid Harmful Substances Completely**

Some things that might seem harmless can actually hurt your developing baby. It's better to be safe and avoid them entirely.

**Strictly avoid:**

* Alcohol in any amount
* Smoking or secondhand smoke
* Recreational drugs
* Certain medications (always check with your doctor first)

**Be careful with:**

* Cleaning products with strong chemicals
* Paint fumes
* Cat litter (risk of infection)

**9. Learn About Labor and Delivery**

Knowledge reduces fear and helps you feel more confident about childbirth. Understanding what to expect makes the experience less scary.

**Ways to prepare:**

* Attend childbirth education classes
* Read books about pregnancy and delivery
* Talk to other mothers about their experiences
* Discuss your birth plan with your doctor

**Our hospital offers:**

* 24x7 emergency care for any pregnancy complications
* Experienced doctors and nurses
* Modern delivery facilities
* Compassionate care for every family

**10. Build Your Support Network**

Having people who care about you makes pregnancy much easier. Don't try to do everything alone.

**Your support team might include:**

* Your partner or spouse
* Family members who can help with daily tasks
* Friends who have had babies
* Healthcare providers you trust

I was in Starbucks in Taiwan yesterday. I had my coffee in an indoor cup, want to get it out into a takeaway cup as we wanted to leave.

So I, wanting to practice and thinking back to my textbook, asked in such a mouthful of words:

你可以幫我把那杯咖啡放在外帶杯嗎？

Such an overcomplicated mouthful!

My Taiwanese partner casually walked past, overhearing this and corrected me. He said to the server:

可以外帶嗎？

And I just felt so stupid for wanting to try and use the grammar points (active voice 把 structure) from my text book when it could have just been so simple and polite.

So, that’s just my experience and I think it’s a bit of a warning about paying too much attention to grammar and text book usage can give you a bit of analysis paralysis - when just being simple will more than suffice and is even preferred.",2,1752214698.0,ChineseLanguage,6,1.0,False
