1lx7uh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fios/comments/1lx7uh9/fios_or_apple_problem/,Fios or Apple problem?,"Moved to Baltimore a month ago and the place we rented was already wired for Verizon Fios so we set up service. The ONT was already there so we plugged in the Router and Wifi Extender they gave us - followed all the steps as given to us. We have all Apple products that are connecting to the wifi - Apple TV, iPhones, and three MacBook laptops.

We have had to reset the router almost every day since then, as inevitably one of our devices will not connect to it unless we reset, with the one exception being the Apple TV. Our phones will regularly drop the Wifi, and if I work from a coffee shop and then come home, my MacBook Air will not re-connect to the home wifi. Or rather, it will say that Wifi is connected but won't load any websites until I re-set the router, which takes fully 10 minutes to cycle through. This has been a huge issue as I work from home and have been frequently late to meetings because the wifi won't work. 

Weirdly, though, the Apple TV never seems to have this issue. It reliably loads Netflix, YouTube TV, etc even when our phones and computers aren't connecting to the internet. 

Verizon's customer service has been really rough - after hours spent trying to reach them they've barely listened to our issue and sent out technicians twice who did nothing except set up the Wifi Extender and replace the ONT, neither of which fixed the problem.  

Any ideas about what's happening here? Is there a setting on our phones or computers that I need to change to connect reliably to Fios? We've had Google Fiber and Spectrum and not had this problem with either of those providers so I'm thinking it's a Verizon issue but am really struggling to get help.

I've rehashed every moment:
Was their tone genuine or polite?
Did they intend to reconnect or just didn’t want to shut me down?
Were they busy—or avoiding me?

The rice jar is empty so I had to get the big industrial bag out of the closet to refill the jar. 

My dog's heartworm medication is next to the rice, and he was supposed to get that yesterday. And since the Heartguard resembles a treat, I should take him out to use the bathroom first. 

So I need socks, which are all dirty, so I gathered up my socks only to be reminded that I'm out of laundry detergent, and I really need to order groceries, and my dog is almost out of his allergy pills.

But I haven't deposited my paycheck yet, because I have a job that still gives me a handwritten paper paycheck, so I need a pen.

Which is on my desk, along with all my parents' administrative shit, which is now my responsibility (which is frankly ridiculous considering I have 4 siblings who are all better-brained than I am) because they fucked off to live in Uganda.

Which also reminds me I haven't booked my vacation hotel room, because I haven't deposited my paycheck yet, because I need a pen and **god wtf haven't i had a coffee yet this morning**.

Because the coffee is almost out and I need to order the groceries but first I need to check to see if I need rice.

1lx7pn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lx7pn5/i_work_at_a_grocery_store_that_doesnt_take_cash/,I work at a grocery store that doesn't take cash (pt. 16),"I opened the file slowly, the brittle cover groaning like old floorboards beneath a forgotten house. Dust lifted in a faint puff, and the scent that spilled out hit us like a wave—old paper, mildew, the metallic ghost of ink long dried. It smelled like a place that had been waiting to be disturbed.

The first page was thick and yellowed, the kind of paper that felt almost waxy to the touch. Its corners were curled and soft, frayed from time or handling—maybe both. It had lived through things. Maybe it remembered them better than anyone else could now.

Clipped to the top was a photograph.

Black and white.
Faded, but not faded enough.

The edges were scalloped, curling slightly as if it had been held and studied many times. A photo like this didn’t come from a family album—it was official. Cold. A government-issued document. Identification maybe, or a Record.

We leaned in, breath held.

It was him.
E. Stantsman.

But not quite the version we knew.

In the photo, he looked… human.

Truly human.

His features were still recognizable, but wrong in subtle ways. His face was leaner, the skin weathered in a very mortal sort of way. The eyes were smaller, set deep under a heavy brow—nothing like the wide, glinting, starving gaze he wore now.

No shine. No impossibly smooth skin. No perfect, eerie symmetry.

Just a man.
Tired. Quiet. Pinned still by a camera that didn’t know what he would become.

His smile was slight and flat, lips barely upturned—professional, if not entirely willing. Not that too-wide grin we’d come to fear. Not that stretch of teeth that always looked like they were waiting to bite.

He wore a stiff, narrow suit—pressed and proper. The kind they used to wear when you had to be somebody. A tie like a noose. A short lapel. Behind him, a plain, gray backdrop—something municipal. Bureaucratic.

Like he was there for a permit.
Or being processed.
Or documented… before disappearing into something else.

And for the first time, I didn’t feel like I was looking at a monster.
I felt like I was looking at the moment a man was about to vanish.

He looked like someone’s distant uncle—a tired  worker with worn lines etched into his face. A man who might have brushed past you on the street, unnoticed, swallowed up by the crowd without leaving a trace.

But the longer I stared, the more my stomach knotted tight.

Because beneath the surface, the shape of him was unmistakable.
The bones beneath the skin.
The shadow of what he was becoming.

It was like staring at a mask—but in reverse.

This was the real face—raw and unguarded—before the creature inside awakened and demanded more.

Before he traded pieces of himself away, becoming something other. Something less human.

The photograph was clipped to a yellowing sheet of paper, boldly labeled in sharp black ink:
Customer Dealings.

The title alone sent a chill crawling down my spine.

The ink hadn’t faded—not a trace. Its loops and curls were crisp, deliberate—too perfect, as if the hand that penned it never trembled, never faltered, never aged.

The paper beneath my fingers felt unnaturally smooth—untouched by the ravages of time, unlike the fragile pages surrounding it. It was preserved. Protected.

Like something sacred. Or perhaps something cursed.

And then, my eyes fell upon the list.

Handwritten. Precise. Every line placed with eerie care, as if each word had been carved into the paper rather than penned.

Too neat.

Each entry whispered secrets—fragments of lives stripped bare, traded away like currency, leaving behind only hollow echoes of what once was.

---

>Sack of cornmeal — ""The smell of mother’s hair on quiet Sunday mornings.""
>Sugar, white, 2lbs — ""The sound of his daughter’s first whispered word.""
>Salt, 4lbs — ""The taste of his wedding day kiss—bitter and sweet.""
>Coffee, whole beans — ""The warmth of a fire crackling through the first snow.""
>Dried beans, sack — ""The rough embrace of his father’s coat, where he buried his face.""
>Molasses, 3 jars — ""The joy on the day he found his lost dog again.""
>Tallow — ""The lullaby his grandmother sang in a language now forgotten.""
>Pickles and preserves, 7 jars — ""Seven endless nights of dreamless sleep.""
>Salted pork, 10lbs — ""His fading memory of ever feeling full.""

---

Etched in delicate ink—memory by memory, shame by shame—each line impossibly pristine, frozen in time. The kind of writing that felt less like ink and more like a slow, deliberate carving into the paper’s very soul.

I leaned in closer, heart pounding, breath shallow as if afraid to disturb the fragile ghosts trapped in the faded pages.

“Someone kept this,” I whispered, voice cracking like a secret barely meant to be spoken.
“Like it mattered. Like they… treasured it.”

And maybe they did.

Because this wasn’t just a ledger.

It was a mausoleum.

A cold, silent tomb for everything people had been forced—or foolish enough—to give up. A shrine built on stolen moments and shattered souls.

And somewhere between the looping, perfect curls of ink,
Mr. Stantsman had crowned himself its high priest—guardian of these quiet graves.

The weight of it pressed down, thick and suffocating, as if the paper itself was watching, waiting.

With trembling fingers, I turned the page—each flick echoing like a death knell—and found more.

More memories ripped away.

Another list stretched before me—longer, more chaotic, the lines sprawling unevenly across the page. His handwriting, once precise and deliberate, now clung to the edges like a desperate grasp—looser, shakier, frantic. It was the scrawl of a man slipping, unraveling, losing control. A man hunted by hunger—insatiable, ravenous.

Each item was still paired with a memory.

But these weren’t tender recollections.

They were the bedrock of a person’s being.

They were the bedrock of a person’s being.

Foundations so sacred, so vital, no one should ever be forced to give them away.

The ink itself etching out the price of a soul line by dark line.

---

>Candles, 3 packs — “The feeling of fear when he first saw his house catch fire.”
>Kerosene, 2 gallons — “The memory of how he screamed for help—and no one came.”
>Matches, 6 tins — “The warmth of holding someone’s hand during a thunderstorm.”
>Soap lye, 8 bars — “The comfort of his mother scrubbing the dirt from his knees.”
>Laundry starch, 4 barrels — “The scent of freshly pressed clothes before Sunday church.”
>Washboards, pails, clotheslines — “The image of laundry dancing in the wind, his wife humming beside him.”
>Needles, spools of thread, thimbles — “The night he stayed up sewing a doll for his daughter’s birthday.”
>Flour, 25lbs — “The taste of warm biscuits, and laughter in a kitchen long gone.”
>Rope — “The last words spoken by the only friend who ever forgave him.”
>Lantern oil — “The memory of ever feeling safe in the dark.”

---

He was trading away the very roots of himself—
each delicate thread of memory that bound him to the world,
each shard of his humanity quietly slipping through his fingers.

With every line I read, the terrible truth settled over me like a suffocating fog:

He wasn’t fighting to survive.
No.
He was unraveling.
Dissolving.
Disappearing—piece by shattered piece—until all that remained was a hollow, empty shell.

And something else—something dark, hungry, ancient—was waiting beneath the surface.

My fingers shook as they traced the faded script,
the letters growing heavier here, almost as if the ink bled desperation,
like the writer had pressed down too hard,
knowing these were the memories no one should ever surrender. But hungered for them. 

Memories of love, pain, hope, joy—all surrendered.
The foundation of his soul stripped away like flesh from bone.

And yet, despite the cost—he gave them up.

Like a slow death in ink and paper.

A quiet, endless fading into shadow.

I swallowed hard. The air around me felt thick, heavy.
The room grew colder, the edges darker.

Because these weren’t just pages.
They were a funeral pyre—
and he was the corpse set aflame by his own hand.

The ink here pressed deeper into the paper, thicker and almost wet-looking. Each stroke felt deliberate, urgent, as if the writer knew these memories were sacred, the fragile core of a person’s soul. These were the ones no one should ever surrender—the essence of life itself, bleeding slowly away in cold, unforgiving script.

---

>Nails, 5 tins — “The first time his child called him ‘Daddy.’”
>Hammer — “His wife’s soft laugh during a quiet morning in bed.”
>Axe — “The promise whispered in the woods, ‘Always together, no matter what.’”
>Rag doll — “The tiny hand clutching her favorite toy before drifting to sleep.”
>Playing cards — “The warm glow of family game nights, safe and whole.”
>Envelopes, 12 packs — “The last letter his wife ever wrote, folded with trembling hands.”
>Stamps, 12 packs — “The birthday cards he never forgot to send, even when apart.”
>Bible — “The prayers said in desperation, begging for another chance.”

---

These weren’t just memories. They were the foundation of a life—fragile, irreplaceable pieces that stitched a man’s soul together.

The moments that made him more than flesh and bone.

Sacred. Untouchable.

And yet, here they were—laid bare on yellowed paper, sold like common goods.

Taken.

Vanished into thin air.

With every memory lost, something vital slipped away from him.

I could almost feel it—the slow, suffocating hollowing out of a man’s essence.

The warmth drained, replaced by a creeping coldness, as if his very spirit was being extracted, leaving behind an empty shell.

A prisoner in his own fading self.

Hungry. Desperate.

Waiting for something else to claim that void—something ancient, something dark, something hungry.

And I knew—the price of forgetting was far worse than losing memories.

It was losing yourself.

Completely.

Forever.

The last page was a chaotic sprawl, suffocating in its relentless detail.

Endless rows of bottles, tins, and jars—each one a bitter remedy meant to dull a pain that clung like a ghost refusing release.

The quantities piled high, stacked with frantic precision—a desperate fortress built by a man fighting a losing battle against the slow erosion of his mind and body.

A mountain of medicine bought at an unbearable cost: memories, precious and irreplaceable, traded away like currency to silence the torment within.

The air seemed to thicken as I stared at the ledger, the faded ink whispering a chilling truth: the more you try to numb the pain, the more you bleed away pieces of yourself—until nothing remains but hollow echoes.

---

>Laudanum, 10 bottles — “The memory of pain easing, of safety in the dark.”
>Camphor, 14 tablets — “The memory of love, sharp and bittersweet.”
>Mustard plaster, 12 tins — “The memory of promises made and broken.”
>Salves, 13 tins — “The memory of a gentle touch, fleeting and warm.”
>Quinine, 12 bottles — “The memory of laughter, bright and fading.”
>Peppermint oil, 13 bottles — “The memory of happiness, cold and slipping away.”
>Cod liver oil, 13 bottles — “The memory of a last embrace, bittersweet and lost.”
Iodine tincture, 13 bottles — “The memory of cleansing, never reaching the soul.”
>Cough syrups, opium-based, 13 bottles — “The memory of sweet escape, too painful to hold.”
>Alum, 14 tins — “The memory of safety, sealed behind bitter salt.”

---

Each memory a thread unraveling the man’s being—
Leaving only shadows where once light lived.

And then—
at the very bottom of the page,
separated by a thick, dragging line as if the ledger itself wanted to draw breath before revealing it—
was a final entry.

No units. No weight.
No ordinary item.

Just two words, inked in a dark, angry hand.
The letters were thicker than the rest—
the ink having bled through the paper like dried blood, staining the backside.
It looked less written and more carved.

GROCERY STORE

And there—etched in jagged, trembling letters, as if penned by a hand gripped with desperation—pressed deep into the brittle page:

YOUR HUMANITY

Not a trick. Not a symbol.

A binding pact.

I could almost feel it searing through the paper like the last embers of a dying fire—hot, suffocating, and final.

No memory marked it. No tender recollection or flicker of light.

Only the ultimate price.

Everything he had left to give.

No remorse. No warmth. No flicker of soul.

Only a ravenous hunger.

He hadn’t simply built the store.

No.

He had fed it.

And in the end—

He became the monster lurking inside.

A place made from hollowed-out flesh and purpose,
wrapped in fluorescent lighting and friendly signs,
shelved with perfectly aligned goods
and manned by a smile stretched too wide.

This wasn’t a store.

It was a vessel.

My hands trembled as I turned the pages, the fragile paper crackling like dry leaves beneath my fingertips. Each sheet felt colder than the last, heavier—as if the weight of what I was learning was sinking into my bones.

Then I found it.

Tucked near the back of the file, folded crisply in thirds, was a town-issued form.

Thicker stock. Official seal in the corner.
Transfer of Property – Commercial Lot #12
– dated in faded type nearly a century ago.

I unfolded it slowly.

At the top:
Recipient: Elias Stantsman
Property Transferred: General Mercantile, Main Street
Now simply referred to as “The Grocery.”

And there it was—
at the bottom of the page.

A signature in dark, swooping ink, still bold after all these years.

Mayor Whitlock.

And beneath that, a note scrawled in the margins, barely legible:

“Paid in full. May he serve the town well.”

I stared at the words, my heart hammering in my chest, pounding so loudly I could almost hear it echo through the stillness around me.
Not bought with money.
Not a loan. Not an inheritance.

He was given the store.

Signed over. Transferred.

By the town itself.

The ink looked ancient—thick and almost wet, like it had been pressed deep into the fibers of the brittle paper by a hand that trembled with dark purpose. I imagined the scratch of the quill as it carved the deal into history—cold, precise, and irrevocable.

But there was more.

Behind the property form, pressed like a ghost against the folder’s back, was another document, thinner, fragile—almost like a whispered secret waiting to be uncovered.

I slid it free, my fingers shaking as they brushed the faded edges.

The title froze me in place:

“Certificate of Appointment – Acting Mayor”

No ceremony. No votes. No announcement.

Just a name signed in spidery ink, smeared slightly as if written in a rush.

A cracked wax seal, blackened and brittle, held the paper shut like a tomb.

The town crest, jagged and worn, stared back at me—nothing like the polished emblem I’d seen on signs around town.

The ink was darker here, thicker, almost as if it had bled into the paper, alive and hungry, staining it forever.

I swallowed hard, the air growing thick, almost suffocating.

This wasn’t just a piece of paper.

It was a dark contract.

A binding promise.

A trap sealed long ago, and I had just stumbled into its shadow.

I scanned the page, breath caught tight in my chest, lungs aching like even the air had gone still.

Appointed to: Elias Stantsman
Role: Interim Mayor of Whistlemoore Township
Effective Date: October 3rd, 1882

My eyes stuck there.

1882.

That couldn’t be right.

It wasn’t just far back—it was impossible.
No one from that time should still be walking these streets.
Should still be behind a register, smiling with too-white teeth and eyes that never blinked.

I blinked, forcing myself to look lower.

Signature:

The name on the original line had been smeared. Not time-worn—deliberately blurred. Like someone had tried to erase it from the record. Or maybe from memory itself.

But below it, clear and sharp, in ink that had sunk deep into the page—like it had been burned into the fibers—was another name.

E. Stantsman
Accepted. In perpetuity.

No term limit.
No expiration clause.
No transition of office.

Just a final red stamp below the signatures.

The ink was darker than any other mark on the page—almost wet, almost breathing.

“By memory, not by blood.”

The words curled around my spine like frostbite.

I stared at them, heart beating too fast, too loud.
And suddenly, I understood.

He hadn’t taken power by force.
There was no coup. No stolen office.

The town had given it to him.

Willingly.
Long ago.

And no one had taken it back.

Because no one remembered.

Because he had taken that, too.

And now he stood at the center of it all—smiling, still smiling—anchored in a town that had long since forgotten the deal it made.

A town ruled by something that wore a man’s name,
but no longer wore his soul.

We sat in silence.
Not the soft kind that comes with peace—but the kind that presses in from all sides.
Thick. Charged. Listening.

The file lay open between us on the coffee table—its fragile pages fanned out like something dissected. Exposed. Bleeding truths neither of us had asked for.

That last document still hovered at the edge of my vision, the year 1882 carved into my memory like a wound that wouldn’t close.

I couldn’t bring myself to touch it again.
I couldn’t look at her, either.

Mabel sat across from me, her frame stiff and still, hands clasped tight in her lap as if she were holding herself together by sheer will.
She didn’t blink. Didn’t move.

The room had gone cold.

Not from the air—but from something else.
Something older. Watching.

We didn’t speak.

There was nothing left to say.
Only the terrible hum of the house settling around us.
Only the shared weight of what we now knew.

Fear.
Not loud or panicked—but silent. Rooted. Crawling.

And underneath it, a quiet, growing dread:

My heart pounded against my ribs like it was trying to escape.
Each beat sharp and frantic, as if it too wanted to run from what we’d uncovered.
I felt small.
So impossibly small.
Like I had peeled back the corner of something ancient—something vast and wrong—and now, it saw me too.

He had been the mayor.
He had owned the store.
He had been here since 1882.

And the town had let him.

Mabel’s breath hitched. “I…”
Her voice was brittle, fraying on the edge of sound.
But she didn’t finish.

She couldn’t.

I shook my head, slow and numb. My hands wouldn’t stop trembling. My mouth was dry. My skin felt tight, like the air around me was being sucked into something older and colder than the room we sat in.

There was too much.

Too much horror behind those neatly written lines.
Too many lives, too many memories—devoured and forgotten.
And we had seen them.
We had read them.
We were part of it now.

I tried to speak. To form a question. A plan. Anything.
But all that escaped my throat was a whisper, barely mine:

“…What is he?”

Mabel didn’t answer.
She didn’t move.
Because maybe—we already knew.

Because maybe we already knew.
And maybe saying it out loud would make it real.

I am an INFJ (25M) living in NYC, and to no surprise, have had no luck making genuine friends here. I've been living here for 3 years now and want so badly to find my people outside of my friends from back home  (we typically Facetime and text via group chat). I figured if I connect with more INFJs in NYC, perhaps that would be my saving grace. I enjoy being an INFJ I just think our biggest shadow aspect is our feeling so disconnected from others/the world, or feeling like no one understands us. Perhaps a solution would be finding other INFJs who operate similarly. That way, if we're intentional about it, we can work to heal that sense of isolation from a place of common understanding and physical togetherness. Maybe that looks like a coffee chat somewhere and we can all talk about the things we're deep diving into lately. Maybe we can do movie dates and psychoanalyze characters together LOL. Idk I just really want cool friends here and my introversion doesn't help with physically putting myself out there so I thought i'd at least show myself here and maybe we could take it offline.

Sharing my travel diary for the interest of others who may find themselves in want of a break from the city

Traveled solo from HCMC. I left at 4:45am, but would recommend being on the road by 4am (longer travel time with less traffic)

⏱️Drive time (including stops for fuel, rest, coffee and photos) : About 6hrs 15 minutes. 

📝Note: I did not take the direct route suggested by google as I am not confident to drive on busy Interprovincial roads. Instead, I used  a motorbike guide from the website Vietnam Coracle as reference for the drive (on website, search motorbike guides for HCMC - Dalat.  Cat tiền park is along the route to Dalat).  

🏍️Easy ride as roads were mostly  well-paved. Bumpy stretches here and there due to construction & caused some congested bits.  A second reminder to myself to leave by 4am next time.


🏩Accommodations:
[Hotel name shared after trip completion]

Room C4 (perfect for solo traveler, imo)
Private balcony facing Dong Nai river
Comfy bed facing picture window. 

Room fee:

Friday night: about 350k

Saturday night: 400k

Breakfast included

Pool on site

☀️Day 1
Arrived at 11am.  Checked in and napped. 4pm took exploratory ride - scenery is lush, dense and green.  Picked up snacks for tomorrow’s self-guided tour of the national park.  Returned to hotel for dinner. Food was just okay. 

📝Note: Guided tours are available, but after reading the reviews of other park visitors and considering my own preference to “get lost in nature”, I have opted to go it on my own.  

Evening time: natural sounds on steroids.  After sunset, heard birds singing, insects trilling  and … no horn honking. Stars sighted for a long while before clouds cover rolled in.  So quiet, I was able to hear the Rainfall rolling in before it fell in my area. 
This is heaven 🤩

1lx7nwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypoglycemia/comments/1lx7nwo/things_that_helped_my_rh/,Things that helped my RH,"Hey yall. Been seeing a lot of really down in the dumps posts. And I’ve been exactly where you guys are. Truth be told it took a few months to start seeing improvements with all the changes I made. But I’m gonna tell you how I did it. I’m not cured by any means. Can’t really have a soda or too much carbs. Sometimes at night I can get away with eating a bit worse but for the most part I just avoid that stuff. And I do miss all my vices like alcohol and nicotine, but life is worth living for me now and I want you all to get to where I’m at. So here are some tips:

First, diet. Everyone says it, and they’re right. But even fixing your diet won’t improve your condition at first. Took a couple months I would say of eating the right things for my body to gradually start accepting my new diet. I was a severely unhealthy person before this happened to me. As such, it took me a long time to really fully start eating the way I’m supposed to. Cutting down on sugar wherever you can (I can only drink decaf coffee, with 2 pumps of syrup instead of the 6 it comes with), and if you do eat sugar, eat it with protein and fiber, aka a meal. I’m also a picky eater so I kinda eat mostly the same stuff everyday. Meatballs, broccoli, brown rice. Equal portions. Chipotle is also really great, I always get brown rice. Sometimes there are gonna be healthy things that just don’t work for you. I go to this place called anzo, it’s super healthy but for some reason it makes me feel like shit. So it’s a trial and error process. Sometimes things will make you feel sick and you’ll have no idea why. Eggs are another one that are hit or miss for me. Could be the ketchup/hot sauce I use but I can’t give that up so if I eat them it’s gotta be later in the day. Also, don’t eat unless you’re hungry. I’ve noticed I feel worse if I eat without feeling hungry. Little snacks are fine but entire meals are a no go for me. 

Second, vitamin D (for me), get a vitamin panel done. It really did seem to help with my condition—but mostly it improved my mental health which was HUGE for me. Before, I had no real motivation to make the lifestyle changes I needed to make. I was like fuck it, I feel like shit, I guess I’ll just always feel like shit now. My first month of taking my vitamin d was such a game changer. Cleaned my room, my car, took care of everything I needed to take care of, it’s like a lighting bolt came from the sky and shocked me into motion. My entire outlook on life has changed. I used to be so scared to leave the house for fear of an attack. Grocery stores were the worst. Now I can leave the house, and even start feeling a little sick. But not be like on the verge of a panic attack until I get home. I really recommend checking with your doctor to see if you’re deficient in anything. My doc caught the vitamin d, but didn’t catch that my ferritin was low. So have them send you the bloodwork and do a bit of your own research. While I’m not discounting the RH, sometimes having little vitamin deficiencies here and there can exacerbate symptoms. Fixing them can help you cope with life somewhat better, i.e not being fatigued all the time, depressed, etc. 

Third, have everything you need at all times. What also help cut down on my anxiety is having glucose pills on me, and I never leave the house without almonds and cheese. That way when I start feeling sick, I can self soothe somewhat by eating, even if it doesn’t really help all the much. At least my brain knows I have food in me that won’t spike my sugar so I won’t pass out. Glucose pills for when it gets bad. Make sure your ac is working in your car, you’re gassed up, etc. having all of these little things squared away helps give you more peace of mind. So if you start feeling sick while your out, you can retreat to your car.  

Fourth, exercise. It took me a long time to be able to really start moving without feeling like death. Had to work my way up. I started with yoga. And you gotta be consistent, even though it’s hard! I can run for about 25 min in 3 min intervals (walk, then run, then walk, etc)

Fifth, if you use nicotine, stop. I was a heavy vaper for about 4 years. The hqds are the worst for you too, way more nicotine than the average vape or cigarettes. I’ve heard that quitting can make some people worse for a time. I can’t really speak to that, I felt awful while using and after I quit. But trust me when I say when you come out of it it’s so much better. I live in fl and they have a program called tobacco free Florida where they send you gum, patches, etc. FOR FREE. See if there’s something like that in your state. 

These are all the things that helped me. They didn’t cure me, but I’m not laying in bed all day wanting to die anymore. I used to tell myself if I’m not better in a year I’m killing myself. Now life is worth living again. I stop and smell the flowers, notice the sky, etc. 

I’m also EXTREMELY lucky in that I have a job that is very accommodating to what I have going on. It’s remote so I can take it easy on off days. Especially around my period, I always feel 10x worse around that time. It took me a very long time to find this job, probably about a year and a half of job hunting, and I had to take a pay cut. I live with my mom since all of this began so it’s not too big of a deal. But I still get down about being 31, sick all the time, and living with my mom. The vitamin d really helped with those thoughts. Genuinely cured my depression. Now I feel like it’s possible to get a raise, and move out and be on my own. 

Anyways love yall, it does and can get better. Even if you’re not cured, you can improve it. And life won’t be so bad anymore. Muah muah xoxoxox",1,1752242452.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False
1lx7nh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/how_to_do/comments/1lx7nh8/how_to_protect_your_internet_privacy_a/,How to Protect Your Internet Privacy: A Human-Friendly Guide,"In our increasingly digital world, your **internet privacy** isn't just a tech buzzword—it's a fundamental right and a crucial aspect of your **online security**. Think of your digital footprint as an extension of yourself; wouldn't you want to protect it? This guide will empower you with actionable steps to reclaim your privacy, written by a human, for humans.

## 1. Choose Your Browser Wisely

Your browser is your primary window to the internet. Not all windows are created equal when it comes to privacy.

*   **Privacy-Focused Browsers:** Ditch Chrome's data-hungry ways for browsers like **Brave**, **Firefox** (with privacy extensions), or **DuckDuckGo**'s browser. They often come with built-in ad and tracker blockers.
*   **Extensions are Key:** Install reputable browser extensions like **uBlock Origin** (for ad-blocking) and **Privacy Badger** (for blocking invisible trackers).
*   **Configure Settings:** Dive deep into your browser's settings. Disable third-party cookies, set ""Do Not Track"" (though it's often ignored), and clear browsing data regularly.

## 2. Embrace a VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A **VPN** is your digital invisibility cloak. It encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making it much harder for others to track your online activities.

*   **Why use one?** Especially important on public Wi-Fi, a VPN prevents snoopers, ISPs (Internet Service Providers), and even governments from seeing what you're doing online. It also helps bypass geo-restrictions.
*   **Choose a Reputable Provider:** Look for VPNs with a strict **no-logs policy**, strong encryption (AES-256), and plenty of server locations. >! A free VPN often comes with hidden costs, like selling your data !<

## 3. Master Your Passwords and Authentication

Weak passwords are like leaving your front door unlocked. Strong, unique passwords are non-negotiable.

*   **Password Managers:** Use a **password manager** (e.g., LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden) to generate, store, and auto-fill complex, unique passwords for every single account. You only need to remember one master password.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Always enable **2FA** or multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever available. This adds an extra layer of security, usually a code from your phone or a physical key, preventing unauthorized access even if your password is stolen.
*   **Avoid Password Reuse:** Never, ever reuse passwords across different sites.

## 4. Rethink Your Search Engine

Google tracks your searches to build a profile of you. There are excellent alternatives.

*   **DuckDuckGo:** The most popular choice for privacy-conscious users. It doesn't track your searches or collect your personal information.
*   **Startpage:** Uses Google's search results but anonymizes your queries, giving you Google's power without the tracking.

## 5. Audit Your Social Media & App Permissions

Social media platforms and apps are designed to collect your data. Take control.

*   **Privacy Settings Deep Dive:** Regularly review and tighten the **privacy settings** on all your social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.). Limit who can see your posts, photos, and personal information.
*   **App Permissions:** Be vigilant about what permissions you grant to mobile apps. Does a flashlight app really need access to your contacts or microphone? Probably not. Deny unnecessary permissions.
*   **Data Minimization:** Only share what is absolutely necessary online. Think twice before posting sensitive personal information.

## 6. Secure Your Email

Your email is often the gateway to many of your online accounts.

*   **Encrypted Email Services:** Consider using end-to-end encrypted email services like **ProtonMail** or **Tutanota** for sensitive communications. These services ensure only you and the recipient can read your emails.
*   **Avoid Public Email Accounts for Sensitive Data:** Don't use your personal email for everything, especially sign-ups that might lead to spam or data breaches.

## 7. Be Wary of Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks (coffee shops, airports) are notoriously insecure.

*   **Always use a VPN:** As mentioned, a VPN is your best friend on public Wi-Fi. It encrypts your data, preventing others on the same network from snooping.
*   **Avoid Sensitive Transactions:** Refrain from online banking, shopping, or accessing confidential information when on an unsecured public Wi-Fi network.

## 8. Keep Your Software Updated

Security patches are vital for **data protection**.

*   **Enable Automatic Updates:** Ensure your operating system (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android), web browser, and all applications are set to update automatically. Updates often contain critical security fixes that patch vulnerabilities.

## 9. Understand Your Digital Footprint

>! Everything you do online leaves a trace, from your searches to your likes to your online purchases !<

*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically Google yourself, check old social media posts, and review your online accounts. Delete accounts you no longer use. Remove old or unnecessary personal information.

### In Summary: Your Privacy Toolkit

| Area               | Action                                    | Keywords                                     |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Browsing**       | Private browser, Ad/Tracker blockers      | **Firefox**, **Brave**, **uBlock Origin**    |
| **Connection**     | Use a VPN                                 | **VPN**, **Encryption**, **IP Masking**      |
| **Authentication** | Password manager, 2FA                     | **Strong Passwords**, **2FA**, **YubiKey**   |
| **Search**         | Privacy-focused search engine             | **DuckDuckGo**, **Startpage**                |
| **Social/Apps**    | Audit settings, Limit permissions         | **Data Minimization**, **Digital Footprint** |
| **Email**          | Encrypted email                           | **ProtonMail**, **Tutanota**                 |
| **Awareness**      | Public Wi-Fi caution, Software updates    | **Online Security**, **Data Protection**     |

Protecting your **internet privacy** is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. By implementing these steps, you'll significantly enhance your **online security** and take back control of your personal data. Stay vigilant, stay safe!

The yellow sticker still clung to its side like a bruise. Then my eyes flicked back to Mabel.

She didn’t speak. Didn’t blink.

But there—just there—something shifted in her eyes. A flicker. Not fear. Not panic.

Something quieter. Sharper.
Calculated.

It was a message.

A warning.
A plea.
Now. Or never.

I swallowed hard, fingers twitching with the pressure of it all.

Slowly, carefully, I slid my hand beneath the counter, the coarse underside brushing against my skin. The stack of brown paper bags rustled softly—just enough to sound like routine. My fingertips found the familiar edge of one and pulled it free.

My other hand reached for the pen—the black one we always used at the till, the one that bled just a little too easily through paper.

I leaned down, pretending to check a drawer. The pressure of being watched prickled across my shoulders like cold breath. Mr. Stantsman’s presence still loomed near, even if he wasn’t right beside us.

I scrawled fast but neat—small, tight letters, barely pressing the ink down:

We got what we came for. Act normal. Leave now.
Meet me at my house at 5pm.
38 Willow Bend.

I folded the bag crisply, creasing the top like I always did when preparing for a customer. It looked harmless. Ordinary.
 
Just part of the job.

Then, without breaking pace, I slid it next to the coffee tin on the counter—like it belonged there. Like nothing about it mattered.

Mabel’s gaze dropped to it. Just a second. A heartbeat.

She didn’t reach for it. Not yet. She didn’t change her expression.

Instead, she laid one hand gently atop the tin. Her fingers tapped the metal once. Twice. Then she gave a soft, thoughtful hum.

Her voice was calm, even pleasant.

“Actually…” she said, drawing out the word like she was deciding as she spoke, “I don’t think I need this today.”

She smiled faintly—warm, easy. Perfect.

“Changed my mind.”

She picked up the folded paper bag like it was nothing.

Just a scrap. Just a thing. Casual and smooth—too smooth.

Her fingers didn’t tremble. Her expression didn’t shift.
But I saw it.

A tension in her shoulders, coiled and tight.

She slipped the bag into the pocket of her dress, the motion quiet, seamless—like it was a habit, like she’d been hiding dangerous things in daylight her whole life.

I gave her the smallest nod.

Not enough to be seen.
 
Barely enough to exist.

She turned. Walked away.

Not fast. Not hesitant. Just… normal.
Normal like a blade disguised as a spoon.
Normal like a last breath before drowning.

The door chimed as she left.

Too bright. Too cheerful. Like a laugh in a funeral home.

It echoed after her, bouncing off the quiet walls of the store like it didn’t belong.
Like it knew.

And then—silence.

I stood behind the counter, heartbeat hammering under my skin. I didn’t move. I didn’t dare.

The silence had a pulse.
The kind that watches. The kind that listens.

I waited.

Waited for the chime to fade.

Waited for the glass to stop trembling in its frame.

Waited for the air to stop feeling so tight.

Only then did I try to breathe—shallow, careful, like the act alone might draw attention.

Breathe.

I told myself again, but my lungs refused to move. My ribs felt like they were holding in more than breath—like they were the only barrier between me and something ancient pressing in from all sides.

Act normal.
Keep your face blank.
Don’t let him smell the fear.

And then—soft footsteps.

The kind you don’t hear until they’re too close.

From the hallway near his office,
Mr. Stantsman emerged.

Not walked—emerged. Like he had peeled himself from the shadows. His posture perfect. Movements slow. Measured. But there was something coiled beneath his stillness, like wire pulled too tight.

His eyes swept the room in one sharp motion.

They landed on the register.

And waited.

Searching.

Expecting.

But there was no red light.

The coffee tin sat untouched on the counter, the gaudy yellow sticker still clinging to the side. Too bright. Too bold. Too obvious now.

He stared at it for a second too long.

Like he didn’t understand.

Like something inside him was trying to recalculate.

His expression didn’t change—but the air did.

The room grew colder. Heavier.

Like the gravity near him was stronger. Like everything inside the store had taken one collective breath—and was now holding it.

Then he spoke.

“Gave up, huh?”

His voice was quiet. Smooth.

But it carried an edge, sharp as a blade behind velvet.

“Guess she isn’t ready to tell more.”

He stepped forward slowly. One tap of his finger against the coffee tin—almost affectionate, like it had disappointed him.

Then he straightened, eyes fixed on the door where Mabel had vanished.

His voice dropped lower.

“She will.”

It wasn’t a prediction.

It was a promise.

“She’ll need something. And she’ll come back.”

The last words were spoken through clenched teeth. Not with rage—but with hunger.

Frustrated hunger.

Like a beast whose prey had slipped through the bars at the last second.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe too loudly. Just nodded slowly.

Like a good cashier.

Like I hadn’t helped someone steal from him.

Like I wasn’t hiding the very thing he’d tear the store apart to find.

He lingered a moment longer, then turned away—shoulders stiff, like his skin didn’t quite fit right anymore.

I stood behind the counter, every part of me buzzing, skin prickling like I’d just escaped being struck by lightning.

Then I blinked.

Like I hadn’t just watched something ancient and starving realize it missed a meal.

I just hoped my shift was ending soon.

Every second felt like it stretched longer than the last—a thin, fraying thread pulling me toward the edge.

I wanted out.

Out of this store.
Out from under his eyes.
Out from behind the counter where I had to pretend nothing was wrong.

I wanted to run.

To rip off the apron, throw open the doors, and flee into the open air—to freedom, or whatever passed for it now.

The file burned like a secret beneath my clothes, still tucked tight beneath my apron, pressing against my ribs like it had a heartbeat of its own.

I could feel it there.

Heavy.

Fragile.

Waiting.

I just needed to make it through the rest of my shift.

Then I’d be free.

Then I’d be safe.

Safe in my house—with Mabel.

Safe where we could open the file… and finally see the truth we weren’t meant to know.

Near me I could hear Mr. Stantsman pacing in his office.

Slow. Methodical. Back and forth.

Back and forth.

His footsteps were soft, but I could hear them—a steady rhythm, broken only by the creak of the floorboards beneath his polished shoes.

He wasn’t stomping.

He was thinking.

Stewing.

Plotting.

And underneath that…

Waiting.

The sound of a clock ticked faintly from somewhere near the front of the store—each second falling like a drop of water into a deep, dark well.

Tick.
Tick.
Tick.

My hands moved without thinking—folding bags, wiping down the counter, pretending.

But every noise around me cut through the quiet like a blade.

The creak of the office floorboards.

The whisper of my breath.

The echo of that cursed ticking clock.

It felt like a countdown.

To what—I didn’t know.

But something inside me whispered:

He knows something’s off.

And the longer I stayed,
the more likely he’d figure out what.

The clock’s final tick echoed like a knell through the stillness of the store.

Time’s up.

My fingers trembled ever so slightly as I began to untie my apron. The fabric slid through my hands like silk soaked in shadow, heavy and suffocating.

Behind me, the silence thickened—thicker than before—as if the very air was holding its breath.

A slow, deliberate creak broke the quiet.

The office door cracked open just enough for a sliver of darkness to spill out—and then his face emerged.

Not quite human anymore.

His smile was a grotesque wound stretched too wide across his face, teeth unnervingly perfect and gleaming like razor-sharp porcelain.

His skin looked too smooth, almost translucent under the dim light, but it was his eyes that stopped my breath cold.

Black, wide, and luminous—like twin voids filled with endless hunger.

They locked onto me.

Burning through me.

“Shift’s over,” he said.

His voice was low and hollow, as if it came from the depths of some forgotten well. It echoed around the walls in a way that made the hairs on my neck stand on end.

“Go home.”

The words felt like a command issued not with kindness but with dark inevitability.

He didn’t move, didn’t blink. His grin never faltered. He was a living shadow, a predator watching silently.

Then, slower now, with venomous sweetness dripping from every syllable, he added:

“See you in the morning.
Hopefully… we get better customers.”

His eyes narrowed just the slightest bit—an unspoken threat lingering in the space between us.

As he slipped back into his office, the door slid shut behind him like the closing of a coffin lid—slow, final, and unyielding.

I stood frozen for a heartbeat longer than I intended, chest tightening with a cold, creeping dread.

My hands shook as I grabbed my bag, feeling the sharp edges of the file pressed against my side—cold and real, a secret that shouldn’t exist.

I moved toward the door, each step weighted with fear and determination.

The afternoon air hit my face like a blade—sharp, biting, and yet it offered no comfort.

I clutched my bag close, the weight of the hidden file pressing cold against my side. The warm air wrapped around me, heavy and still, as I stepped out onto the quiet street.

The road stretched ahead. The town felt different now—distant, like I was moving through a dream that had started to unravel.

Figures moved ahead and beside me, scattered like ghosts. Some wandered with purpose, heads bowed, eyes glazed, steps slow and uneven—mindless, lost in their own empty worlds. Others seemed more aware, shoulders squared, faces blank but their gaze fixed on a destination only they could see.

They didn’t notice me.

Didn’t notice anything.

I passed a man who paused on his porch, staring off into the night with hollow eyes that held no spark of life. A woman shuffled down the sidewalk, clutching a bag, lips moving silently like she was speaking to someone only she could hear.

Their movements were disjointed, like puppets with tangled strings.

I swallowed hard, pulling my coat tighter around me, wishing I could hurry, but careful not to look back.

Because somewhere in the shadows, I knew—

We were all caught.

Some more awake than others.

But none truly free.

I turned the last corner and saw my house waiting for me at the end of the lane—porch light still glowing soft and amber, just like before.

Safe. Familiar.

But before I reached the steps, I spotted her.

Mrs. Shirley.

She was seated in her usual spot on her porch across the street, wrapped in a faded knitted shawl, a steaming mug cradled in both hands. Her gaze was calm, distant, watching the street like she always did, like nothing strange had ever touched this town.

She looked up and gave me a small nod. A sip. A faint smile.

Something about it made my breath slow just a little.

A tether. A reminder of normal.

I nodded back, trying to look like any other teenager just getting home from work.

But the second I stepped through my front door and shut it behind me, I locked it. Twice.

Then I moved fast.

Click. The hallway light.
Click. The living room.
Click. Kitchen. Bathroom. Bedroom.

Every single light, one after another, filling the house with yellow warmth—a barrier against the shadows still clinging to my thoughts.

Then I moved to the windows.

Curtains drawn. Blinds snapped shut.

One by one.

Until the world outside was shut out completely.

No gaps.

No slivers.

No eyes.

Only then did I exhale.

And even that didn’t come easy.

It hadn’t even been five minutes.

I was still standing there, half in the hallway, half in the living room, the brightness of the overhead lights buzzing like anxious insects in my ears. My fingers were still trembling faintly from drawing the last curtain.

I was alone.

Wrapped in artificial light.
Walled in by locked doors and drawn blinds.
Breathing slowly. Trying to feel safe.

And then—

BANG. BANG. BANG.

A knock.
Sharp. Forceful. Sudden.

It sliced through the quiet like a scream.

I jumped, my whole body flinching hard enough that my shoulder bumped the wall behind me.

The sound echoed—once, twice—reverberating in the bones of the house, in the base of my skull. I froze.

My eyes snapped to the front door.

I didn’t move toward it. Just stared.

My breath shallow. Ears straining.

Another knock didn’t come.
Only silence.

Then—

A voice.

Soft. Low. Familiar.

“Marie?
It’s me.”

Mabel.

I exhaled too hard, too fast. The relief came jagged, edged with doubt.

Her voice was cautious, nearly a whisper.

Not a knock anymore. A secret.

Like she knew better than to speak too loud.
Like she feared what might hear her.

I crept toward the door, quiet on the floorboards. My steps deliberate, one after another, each creak of the wood sounding too loud.

I stopped just inches away.

My hand hovered over the lock, but I didn’t turn it yet.
I leaned in.
Listened.

No footsteps behind her.
No shadows moving on the other side.
Just her voice. Still soft.

“Marie… let me in.”

I reached for the deadbolt—slowly.

And prayed I wasn’t opening the door to something else.

Marie stood just beyond the glass, her figure barely visible through the warped curtain of porch light. She gave a small, hesitant wave—her fingers fluttering like she wasn’t sure if she should.

I followed her gaze.

Across the street, Mrs. Shirley sat in the same place as before, still wrapped in her shawl, her mug cradled in both hands.

But now she wasn’t smiling.

She wasn’t looking at us at all.

She stared straight down the road, unmoving, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there—or something I couldn’t see.

Marie’s hand lowered slowly.

No response from Shirley.

Just a long, unblinking sip from her mug.

I felt a chill crawl across the back of my neck.

I quickly unlocked the door and pulled it open.

Marie stepped inside without a word, ducking her head slightly like she was afraid someone might see.

I shut the door behind her.
Turned every lock.

One.
Two.
Three.

The sound of each bolt sliding into place echoed in the quiet room like punctuation marks to a prayer.

We didn’t speak right away.

We just stood there for a moment—two girls in a house too bright, in a town too strange, surrounded by shadows pretending to be neighbors.

“That’s my landlady,” I said quietly, eyes still fixed on the door. “Was, anyway.”

Marie tilted her head, puzzled.

I sighed. “She used to be different.”

I stepped back from the door, the locks still humming in my ears, and turned to look at Marie.

“When I first moved in, she’d sit out on her porch swing every evening. Always had this bright blue cushion she was so proud of. She’d wave at me every time I walked by—and most nights she’d invite me over. Said a porch was no good without company.”

A pause.

I glanced out the side window—just a sliver of the street visible through the drawn curtain.

“She doesn’t wave anymore. Doesn’t speak unless I speak first. And even then… it’s like I’m not really there.”

I shook my head, voice lower now. “She doesn’t swing. She doesn’t invite.”

Marie looked unsettled, the way you look when a familiar face wears the wrong expression.

“Come on,” I whispered.

I led her to the living room, where my bag sat on the couch like it had been waiting for this moment all day.

I pointed to it. “The file’s in there.”

Marie moved to the couch slowly, sitting down like she didn’t want to disturb the air. Her eyes locked on the backpack, her fingers hesitant.

It didn’t feel like we were just about to read old paper.

It felt like we were about to open a grave.

I reached forward, unzipped the bag slowly, my fingers deliberate—like I was opening something fragile… or cursed.

I pulled the file out and laid it gently on the coffee table between us.

It made a dull, tired sound as it landed.

Old. Heavy. Thick with age.

The folder was mottled with time—corners curled and soft, like they'd been handled too much. The once-manila surface had yellowed into something more like parchment, the color of bones left in the sun. Faint water stains bruised the edges. There was a single name handwritten at the top in deep black ink:

E. Stantsman

The ink had bled slightly with age, spidering out from the letters like veins.

A brittle scent rose from it. Dust and dried glue. Mold and something older—something sharp, metallic, like rusted scissors.

It smelled forgotten.

Sealed away. Left to rot.

I didn’t touch it right away. Neither of us did.

We just stared at it.

Because this wasn’t just a file.

This was his past.
His name.
His beginning.

And maybe—if we were lucky—his weakness.

Nultaph stepped aside and smirked, letting the man walk into the store.

His eyes relaxed and he stared down at the frosted drink with a frown.

A woman carefully handled the merchant’s wares, her scrutinizing stare completely focused on the bright glazed pottery. A thick fog unknowingly surrounded her and she felt a light touch to her nape and a sharp shock. 

The fragile pottery nearly dropped from her hands when she heard a childish cackle fading in the distance.

The other day I was hanging out with them both and a couple other people. We were getting coffee outside, it was really hot out so I took off my jacket.

I’m about a year clean from self harm and im so proud of myself. However, I do have a lot of scars. They’re really bad on my legs and still pretty bad on my arms, but im past the point of caring because I prefer being comfortable. When I took off my jacket I noticed Ana staring at my arms and it made me really uncomfortable. People stare a lot and I don’t like it but as long as they don’t say anything I don’t really care. However it felt weird with Ana, the entire time we were out she was staring at me to the point where I decided to cut (haha) my losses and leave a little early. 

That night Will calls me and tells me his gf struggled with self harm in 7th grade (both of them just finished their first year of college) and me “showing off” my scars was triggering for her and she’s going to relapse.

1lx7fbs,https://i.redd.it/b3eisdyi29cf1.png,The Salt and Ice Weight Loss Drink: Miracle or Myth?,"So I've been seeing **The Salt And Ice Weight Loss Drink: Miracle Or Myth?** all over my social feeds lately, and honestly, I was skeptical. Like, really skeptical. Salt water for weight loss? Come on.

But here's the thing—I've been struggling with that sluggish morning feeling and weird bloating issues for months now. My usual coffee routine wasn't cutting it, and I was getting desperate enough to try basically anything that didn't involve expensive supplements or crazy restrictive diets.

👉 *Want to know if this actually works? I tried it for 30 days and here's what happened...*

**Why I Actually Gave It a Shot**

To be honest, the science behind **The Salt And Ice Weight Loss Drink: Miracle Or Myth?** isn't as crazy as it sounds. Your body needs electrolytes to function properly, and most of us are chronically dehydrated without even realizing it. When you're dehydrated, your metabolism slows down, your digestion gets sluggish, and you retain water like nobody's business.

The basic recipe is stupidly simple: cold water, crushed ice, a pinch of Himalayan pink salt, and some fresh lemon juice. That's it. No fancy powders, no weird ingredients you can't pronounce.

**The Ingredient Quality Thing Nobody Talks About**

Here's what I learned the hard way—not all salt is created equal. I started with regular table salt because that's what I had, and it was... not great. Made me feel weirdly bloated and gross.

Then I switched to actual Himalayan pink salt, and wow, what a difference. This stuff contains like 84 different minerals that your body actually needs. It's not just sodium chloride like table salt—it's got magnesium, potassium, calcium, all those good things that help your body actually absorb water instead of just making you puffy.

*Pro tip: Get the coarse stuff and grind it yourself. The pre-ground pink salt sometimes has anti-caking agents that defeat the whole purpose.*

**The Texture Secret That Changed Everything**

Okay, so everyone talks about the recipe, but nobody mentions the texture thing. Here's what nobody tells you: how you prepare the ice makes a huge difference in how quickly everything dissolves and how it tastes.

I crush my ice in a clean kitchen towel—just wrap it up and whack it with a rolling pin. You want pieces, not powder. The irregular chunks melt at different rates, which helps the salt dissolve more evenly. When everything's the same tiny size, you either get a super salty first sip or watery last sip. Neither is fun.

**A Little History Lesson That Blew My Mind**

So apparently, this whole salt-water thing isn't new at all. Ancient Himalayan cultures have been doing versions of this for literally thousands of years. They call it ""sole"" (pronounced so-lay), and it's been used for everything from digestive issues to energy problems.

The ice part is obviously more modern, but the principle is the same. These mountain communities understood that mineral-rich water first thing in the morning helps your body ""wake up"" all its systems. Modern science is just catching up to what they've known forever.

**My Personal Experience (The Real Talk)**

I'm not gonna lie—the first week was weird. The taste takes getting used to, and I felt like I was drinking seawater. But by week two, something shifted. I wasn't dragging myself out of bed anymore. My usual 3 PM energy crash basically disappeared.

The weight thing? I lost about 6 pounds in the first month, but honestly, I think most of that was just water weight and less bloating. My clothes fit better, and I didn't feel like a balloon after meals anymore.

**What I Wish I'd Known Before Starting**

If you're thinking about trying **The Salt And Ice Weight Loss Drink: Miracle Or Myth?**, here's my honest take: it's not magic. It's just basic hydration and mineral balance, but done right.

Start with less salt than you think you need. I was adding way too much at first and felt gross. A quarter teaspoon is plenty for 16 ounces of water. Also, drink it at least 15 minutes before coffee or food. Something about letting it ""prime"" your digestive system.

**The Cultural Context Nobody Mentions**

What's interesting is how this connects to other traditional wellness practices. In Ayurveda, they talk about starting the day with warm salt water to ""kindle the digestive fire."" Japanese culture has similar practices with mineral-rich water.

It makes me think we've gotten so complicated with our health routines that we've forgotten these simple, ancient practices that actually work. **The Salt And Ice Weight Loss Drink: Miracle Or Myth?** isn't revolutionary—it's just getting back to basics.

**My Honest Bottom Line**

Look, I'm not saying this is going to transform your life overnight. But if you're dealing with sluggish mornings, bloating, or just want to try something simple that might help with hydration, it's worth a shot.

The ""weight loss"" part is probably more about reducing water retention and supporting better digestion than actual fat burning. But honestly? Feeling less bloated and more energetic is pretty great on its own.

I've been doing this for three months now, and it's become as automatic as brushing my teeth. My digestion is better, I sleep better, and I just feel more... balanced, I guess?

Have you tried anything like **The Salt And Ice Weight Loss Drink: Miracle Or Myth?** before? I'm curious if other people have had similar experiences or if I'm just having a placebo effect moment.

1lx7doz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lx7doz/can_the_toddy_cold_brew_system_transform_your/,Can the Toddy Cold Brew System Transform Your Coffee Experience? Detailed Review,"The Toddy THM Cold Brew System has become a daily companion in my coffee-making routine, and I must say, it’s revolutionized how I prepare my cold brew. This white, manual coffee maker is marketed as a cold brew champion, and for good reason. Designed as a coffee infuser, it offers a simplistic, hands-on approach to brewing while boasting reusable filters and a compact size ideal for any kitchen setup. As someone who’s spent countless mornings perfecting my coffee ritual, this product caught my eye with its promise of a rich and smooth brew—delivered consistently. 

**Ease of Use and Practical Design**

The design of this coffee maker is practical without unnecessary frills. It measures 7.25 inches in both diameter and width, standing at 12.5 inches tall, making it compact enough to fit on my already cluttered kitchen counter. The manual operation mode brings back the charm of brewing coffee the old-school way, though I did need to spend some time understanding the included components. The set comprises a brewing container with a handle, a glass decanter with a lid, two reusable filters, a rubber stopper, a recipe guide, and instructions. This comprehensive kit means you’re not left searching for additional items—everything you need to get started is in the box.

[Check Toddy THM price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0006h0jvw/)

**Brewing Performance**

As someone who thrives on precision when it comes to coffee, I was intrigued by the claim of smooth cold-brewed coffee. I’ve experimented with various coffee grounds, and the Toddy THM consistently delivers a low-acid, velvety brew. The reusable filters are a game changer; they not only help cut down on waste but also extract the coffee’s full flavor profile. The 12-hour brewing process may require patience, but the payoff is undoubtedly worth it. Additionally, the setup is quite forgiving—no extensive technical knowledge is necessary.

**Highlights**

- Compact, user-friendly manual coffee maker.
- Reusable filters reduce waste and ensure even extraction.
- Produces low-acid coffee, ideal for sensitive stomachs.
- Comprehensive kit for a complete brewing experience.

**Shortcomings**

Of course, there are aspects that could be improved. Cleaning the reusable filters can be tedious, especially if you’re in a rush. The unit itself could benefit from a sturdier design, as I found the brewing container slightly too lightweight when full. Another point worth noting is that it’s not the best for people seeking hot coffee options—it’s strictly made for cold brew aficionados.

- Cleaning the reusable filters requires extra care.
- Brewing container feels slightly flimsy.
- Limited to cold brew; no support for hot coffee.

**Included Accessories**

The package comes with some incredibly thoughtful accessories. The glass decanter, paired with its airtight lid, is perfect for storing cold brew in the fridge. I’ve tested its capacity to keep my coffee fresh, and it holds up for several days without compromising the flavor. The recipe guide offers a creative touch, making the process feel approachable for beginners or those wanting to explore beyond traditional cold brew. While I loved these extras, I did notice the rubber stopper could feel a bit difficult to handle—it takes effort to fit securely, which may bother those with less dexterity.

**Competing Brands**

Compared to other cold brew systems I’ve tried, the Toddy holds its own without aiming to be the flashiest product. Take the OXO Cold Brew Coffee Maker, for instance. While the OXO touts its gravity-driven design and drain-switch technology, the Toddy opts for simplicity. The OXO’s strength lies in convenience for quick draining, but it lacks the same emphasis on reusable components. Other alternatives, like the Hario Mizudashi, lean toward portability and design aesthetics, but don’t quite replicate the same bold flavors. The Toddy might take longer, yet it truly excels at producing a consistently smooth cup compared to its peers.

**Price Performance**

Discussing coffee equipment often boils down to whether it’s worth the financial investment, and this brewer certainly offers a compelling package. While you might find pricier options on the market with advanced features, the Toddy excels in fundamental craftsmanship. Its strong focus on durable materials like reusable filters balances out the higher upfront cost for long-term savings. If manual brewing appeals to you, this is an affordable yet quality choice that delivers value, both in simplicity and taste.

I’ve got to say, the KitchenBro CM-100 Single Serve Coffee Maker is a blessing for people with limited counter space. My kitchen isn’t exactly spacious, and this coffee maker slots neatly into even the tightest corners of my countertop. Its dimensions, 8.2 x 5.5 x 12.5 inches, allow it to fit beautifully without cramping the area. The sleek black design makes it look modern, while its lightweight build—only 4.4 pounds—means I can easily move it from one spot to another. During a weekend road trip, I packed it along, and it became a lifesaver in the hotel room. It’s also perfect for dorm rooms or offices, making it an ideal choice for anyone who values a compact, portable coffee solution.  

**Ease of Use**

The simplicity of using this coffee maker is what won me over. With just a few buttons and a straightforward interface, anyone can figure it out, even before their first morning coffee kicks in. It supports both ground coffee and K-cup pods, which was a game-changer for me. Some mornings, I like experimenting with different pod flavors, while others, I crave the strong aroma of freshly ground coffee. Switching between these options is ridiculously easy. I’ve also appreciated the water reservoir, which is both transparent and removable. Refilling it and keeping tabs on water levels became hassle-free.

**Fast Brewing Capabilities**

If there’s one thing that everyone can appreciate, it’s the speed at which the KitchenBro CM-100 brews coffee. This thing delivers a fresh cup in about 25 seconds! On days when I’ve overslept or need a quick caffeine boost before dashing out the door, this feature is invaluable. Adjusting the brew size between 6 and 14 ounces is effortless, too. Not to mention, it can accommodate most 14-ounce travel mugs, so there’s no need to transfer coffee into a separate container.  

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**

I’m not going to lie; cleaning appliances is not my favorite activity. Thankfully, this coffee maker has an auto-cleaning mode. By simply pressing two buttons simultaneously, it effectively cleans the internal components, saving me time and effort. The auto-shutdown feature adds another layer of convenience. On more than one occasion, I’ve realized I forgot to turn off the machine, but it did the job for me.  

**Strengths**

- Ultra-fast brewing makes it ideal for busy mornings.  
- Compact and portable design is great for small spaces or traveling.  
- Supports both ground coffee and K-cups for versatility.  
- Features like auto-shutdown and a self-cleaning mode simplify maintenance.  

**Pitfalls**

- The coffee output temperature isn’t as high as some may prefer.  
- Slightly larger mugs don’t fit comfortably.  
- With frequent use, the buttons can feel a bit less responsive.  

**Competing Products**

While I’m mostly satisfied with the KitchenBro, I also tested Keurig’s single-serve models. Keurig machines boast a more premium build and usually have slightly better temperature control. However, they’re bulkier and pricier. For someone aiming to save space and spend less, the KitchenBro holds its ground. Another contender, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, offers similar dual brewing capabilities but lacks the sleek simplicity and portability of the KitchenBro unit.  

**Affordable Quality**

What stands out about this coffee machine is how it delivers several premium features at its price point. The versatility of switching between ground coffee and pods without investing in two separate machines gives it an edge over pricier competitors. Honestly, I was skeptical about its self-cleaning feature at first, but after seeing how efficient it is, I doubt I could go back to a coffee maker without this function.

But if you’re a budget-conscious traveler, transportation costs can add up quickly. Fortunately, there’s a smart, eco-friendly, and cost-effective way to explore: [**electric motorbike rental.**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/the-ultimate-one-day-electric-motorbike-itinerary-hue-to-da-nang)

From buzzing cities like **Da Nang** to peaceful ancient towns like **Hoi An** or cultural centers like Hue, travelers are increasingly opting for electric scooter rent services. Not only do these rentals align with sustainable travel goals, but they also help stretch your travel budget without compromising on experience. In this article, we’ll explore why [**motorbike rental Vietnam**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/vietnam-s-top-scenic-motorbike-rides-for-adventure-seekers-2), especially electric options, makes so much financial sense.

# Why Are Electric Motorbikes a Cost-Effective Choice?

# No Fuel Costs - Just Charge and Go

[Motorbike for rent](https://preview.redd.it/t2ffbyzo09cf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1832c322eba8a584b3590074fddf1a465727f3ae)

One of the biggest benefits of an [**electric motorbike rental**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/exploring-hoi-an-by-electric-motorbike-a-sustainable-travel-guide) is that you never need to stop for petrol. Over a week-long trip, fuel costs can add up to a significant amount, especially if you’re exploring large areas or taking day trips to the countryside. With an **electric scooter rent**, all you need to do is plug in the bike overnight or during a rest stop at a café or homestay.

Many hotels in Vietnam now provide free charging stations, especially in tourist-heavy areas like **Hoi An and Hue**. This makes it incredibly easy and cost-efficient to stay on the move without worrying about rising petrol prices.

# Lower Rental Prices Compared to Petrol Bikes

Contrary to what many believe, an [**electric scooter rent**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/best-manual-motorbikes-for-rent-in-da-nang-ride-like-a-pro) is often cheaper than renting a standard petrol bike. This is because **electric scooters** generally have lower operating and maintenance costs for the rental company. These savings are often passed on to the traveler.

In popular cities such as **Da Nang**, you can find scooter rental Vietnam services offering electric bikes for just a few dollars a day perfect for travelers trying to manage expenses. When compared with the best [**motorbike rental Da Nang**](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//D21+An+Th%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3ng+34,+B%E1%BA%AFc+M%E1%BB%B9+Ph%C3%BA,+Ng%C5%A9+H%C3%A0nh+S%C6%A1n,+%C4%90%C3%A0+N%E1%BA%B5ng+550000/@16.0494038,108.1620287,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x31421764bd32e751:0xa2c7448aca742356!2m2!1d108.2444305!2d16.0494195?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYyMy4yIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) offers, electric bikes often come out ahead in terms of both price and convenience.

# Fewer Maintenance Issues and Repair Costs

Traditional motorbikes can occasionally run into mechanical issues especially if the bike has seen heavy use. With an [**electric motorbike rental**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/motorbike-rental-near-da-nang-train-station-best-places-to-rent), there are fewer moving parts, which means fewer chances of breakdowns. This translates to less downtime and no unexpected repair costs.

Most [**motorbike for rent**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/motorbike-rental-with-delivery-service-in-vietnam-a-hassle-free-option) services in Vietnam maintain their electric fleets well, and if something does go wrong, many providers offer free roadside assistance within the city. This gives travelers peace of mind and keeps the journey smooth and hassle-free.

# How to Find the Best Deals on Electric Motorbike Rentals?

# Comparing Rental Prices in Hue, Hoi An & Da Nang

Prices for **electric motorbike rental** can vary slightly depending on the city. In general, [**motorbike rental Hoi An**](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//439%2F28+C%E1%BB%ADa+%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i,+C%E1%BA%A9m+Ch%C3%A2u,+H%E1%BB%99i+An,+Qu%E1%BA%A3ng+Nam+560000/@15.8792842,108.2568549,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x31420d36b13da53f:0x34cc892e815a1dbc!2m2!1d108.3392567!2d15.8792998?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYyMy4yIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) providers offer very competitive rates due to the compact size of the town. Hue has a growing number of electric bike services that cater to tourists exploring the citadel and local villages.

In **Da Nang**, because of the city's size and beachside roads, **scooter rental Vietnam** services often promote **electric scooters** as a quieter, cleaner alternative to petrol bikes. It's always worth checking multiple shops and online platforms to compare the most up-to-date pricing.

# Discounts for Long-Term Rentals

If you’re planning to stay in Vietnam for several days or weeks, many [**electric scooter rent**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/hai-van-pass-motorbike-tour-by-motorvina-top-7-most-impressive-vietnam-experiences) providers offer discounted rates for long-term rentals. For instance, a one-day rental might cost $6, but if you rent for a week, you may pay only $30 total.

Long-term discounts are especially common in tourist-friendly cities like **Hoi An**, where many visitors choose to explore the area slowly. Be sure to ask rental shops directly or look on their websites for multi-day deals before you book.

# Booking in Advance vs. Last-Minute Rentals

While walk-in bookings are possible, reserving your [**electric motorbike rental**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/motorbike-rental-for-tourists-in-da-nang-a-complete-guide) in advance can often get you a better price and ensure availability especially during high season. Online platforms and official rental websites frequently offer early-bird promotions or bundle deals.

On the other hand, booking last-minute might help if you’re flexible and looking to negotiate in person. Shops may offer spontaneous discounts to fill up their fleet for the day. Either way, knowing the average price helps you spot a good deal when you see one.

# Avoiding Unnecessary Rental Fees

Some [**motorbike for rent**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/one-way-motorbike-rental-phong-nha-to-hoi-an) companies include hidden charges for helmets, phone holders, or late returns. Before signing the rental agreement, clarify what’s included and take photos of the bike’s condition to avoid damage claims later.

Also, return the bike with enough battery charge if required by the rental shop. Some will charge a fee for returning an empty battery. A few minutes of planning can save you from unexpected costs.

# Using Free Charging Stations Around the City

Vietnam is becoming increasingly EV-friendly. In cities like **Da Nang** and **Hue**, many coffee shops, restaurants, and even tourist attractions provide free charging outlets for **electric bikes**. These are especially common near the beach or in cultural hubs.

By taking advantage of these free charging stations, you not only avoid fuel costs but also minimize time spent searching for power. Some [**electric motorbike rental**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/one-way-motorbike-rental-da-nang-to-hoi-an) providers even offer maps showing all nearby charging points to make your ride even smoother.



# Conclusion

Traveling Vietnam on a budget doesn’t mean compromising on comfort or mobility. Choosing an **electric motorbike rental** is a smart, sustainable way to enjoy the country’s landscapes, culture, and cuisine while saving significantly on transportation.

With lower daily rates, zero fuel expenses, and minimal maintenance costs, electric scooter rent options are fast becoming the preferred choice for travelers in Vietnam. Whether you're booking through a **scooter rental Vietnam** provider in Da Nang or picking up a bike from a [**motorbike rental Hoi An**](https://motorvina.com/en/travel-inspiration/detail/one-way-motorbike-rental-da-nang-to-hoi-an) service, going electric is not just eco-friendly it’s budget-friendly too.

Let’s face it: the internet is ruled by two things — cats and crypto. And while one curls up in cardboard boxes and knocks water off counters, the other lives in cold wallets and digital ledgers. But what happens when the worlds of fluffy felines and futuristic finance collide? You get *purrfection*. And we’re not kitten around.

Imagine this: a curious cat named Satoshi Whiskers strolls into your living room. His tail is high, his eyes wide, and he’s got the swagger of someone who just discovered decentralized finance. He jumps onto your keyboard (as cats do) and accidentally opens a tab on your browser — it’s [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), the ultimate tool for generating sleek, scannable Bitcoin QR codes.

“Meow?” he asks, clearly intrigued. You explain that this handy site lets people create Bitcoin payment links and QR codes for donations, payments, and tips in seconds. It's the kind of magic that makes receiving Bitcoin as easy as a cat nap.

But wait — there’s more! Satoshi Whiskers wants to test out his newfound Bitcoin knowledge in the wild. So he hops into his cardboard Lamborghini and zips down to the local **Bitcoin ATM**. That’s right — Bitcoin ATMs aren’t just for tech bros and blockchain nerds anymore. Even a savvy feline can use them! These machines let you buy or sell Bitcoin with cash, and they’re popping up in coffee shops, gas stations, and convenience stores everywhere.

At the ATM, Satoshi pulls out his phone (yes, he has an iPhone — it’s cracked from being knocked off the table, of course) and opens the QR code he made at home. With a single scan, he sends himself some Satoshis — and even donates a few to a fellow shelter kitty whose wallet is displayed at the counter.

That’s the beauty of pairing **Bitcoin ATMs** with tools like the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** — it makes the world of cryptocurrency super accessible, even to the non-coding, fluff-covered masses. Whether you're a tech-savvy tabby or a human who just wants to receive BTC for your handmade cat bowties, [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) has your back.

Before heading home, Satoshi swings by the pet store and uses Bitcoin to buy a laser pointer, some freeze-dried treats, and a brand-new scratching post (paid for entirely in BTC, thanks to a QR code taped to the store’s register). He’s living the dream — decentralized, deregulated, and delightfully fluffy.

So next time you’re watching cat videos or cleaning litter boxes, remember: the future is here, and it’s covered in fur and blockchain.

1lx77h2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lx77h2,"Villa del Nido - Nagasaki, Japan (May 2025)","I had the pleasure of dining at Villa del Nido in May. This charming Italian-inspired restaurant is tucked away in Unzen, a sleepy coastal town along the Ariake Sea with Mount Unzen as its dramatic backdrop, about an hour’s drive from Nagasaki city.

Takafumi Yoshida, the owner-chef, runs this intimate 6-table restaurant alongside his wife. After spending time cooking in Italy, he returned to his hometown and opened Villa del Nido right next to his childhood home. The restaurant boasts a Michelin star and has held the Tabelog Bronze award since 2022 (currently rated 4.31).

When we arrived for our Friday lunch, Yoshida-san and his wife warmly welcomed us. They were the only staff, which made the experience feel especially personal. English menus were provided, although they didn’t go into detail about the dishes. To our surprise, we were the only diners for lunch, making it a truly private dining experience.

The meal consisted of around 10 courses. Highlights (in bold) included:

* Fried and pickled radish (home-grown), with local shellfish, marinated seaweed, and fruit seeds – Good interplay of acidity and sweetness.
* **Local fish wrapped in radish with celery root, cabbage, and homemade miso** – Great umami and tang. The radish wrapping reminded me of Chinese dumplings.
* Fried Hirasuzuki (Blackfin Seabass) in potato batter with a vinegared carrot & radish dip – Fish was decent and nicely fried, but the dip was addictive and elevated the dish.
* Mochi bread was served at this point.
* **Local squid with snap peas and onion in a potage of 6-month aged chicken stock and dill oil** – Homely, fragrant, and creamy.
* **Local crab and somen in onion broth, topped with pickled Japanese pepper oil** – Not very Italian, but hands-down the best dish. The somen soaked up the sweet, umami-rich broth, and the spicy kick gave it great depth.
* Asahi rice in sardine broth with sakura shrimp, egg, saffron, and lemongrass foam – Creative but didn’t quite work for me; also didn’t feel very Italian.
* **Fennel-infused pasta in homemade butter topped with roasted radish seeds** – Comforting and delicious. I wish the portion was larger (maybe cut the rice dish to make room for more pasta).
* **Lamb with red wine sauce, mountain vegetables, and broad beans** – Excellent and tender.
* Plum and Koji milk with rosemary.
* Millefeuille of black rice crepe and white chocolate in grappa and egg sauce.
* Papua New Guinea coffee and mignardises to end the meal.

Each course was personally introduced by Yoshida-san. Though he wasn’t fluent in English, he earnestly referred to a notebook of translations, which was a sweet and thoughtful touch. Both he and his wife were constantly smiling and served us with great care, it truly felt like we were guests in their home.

This isn’t the easiest restaurant to get to as you will need to drive. Is it worth making a special trip just for the food? Probably not. But if you are road-tripping around the Nagasaki/Unzen area, a stop here on your journey is definitely worth your time.

Over the next 5 hours, he kept trying to convince me to stick with the plan, saying things like ""we'll still have fun"", ""don't overthink it"", ""I took work off for this"", ""you like hanging out with me don't you?"". I was new to my job at the time and I was a lot younger than him and didn't want to offend or make anyone upset (people pleaser syndrome). I kept saying that I was unwell, not prepared to have sex, and drowsy from medication. He told me to ""drink wine"" multiple times. Whenever I said ""no I can't do this"" he would call me and convince me over the phone. He called 5 times over the day. Eventually I said ""I'm cancelling, please don't hate me"", and he called saying he was just around the corner and that he wanted to pop by to give me some medicinal cream. I gave in because I was so exhausted from the hours of badgering. I told him he could only stay for an hour. When he arrived I opened the door to see him with his overnight bag and beer. No cream. I remember my heart dropped.

He came in and one of the first things he said was ""where's your wine?"", then he poured me a glass. I was so tired physically and mentally that I just drank it. We were sat on the couch and my body was leaning against the wall.
We talked and then he kissed me. I remember the feeling of the wall behind my head. I felt cornered and I knew I was too tired to fight him off me if he kept trying, so I thought the safest way out was through. We went to the bed and I was dry at first, but my body betrayed me when it started happening. I thought I wanted it because my body was reacting, but I knew deep down I didn't want to do this at all. I just wanted it over as soon as possible so I said sexual things to make him finish faster. Eventually I asked him to give me a ""creampie"" because I knew that would make him finish quicker. However, he said ""no"", and that he ""wanted to keep going"", and ""stay the night so we could do it again later"". I remember I started to panic internally and I told him ""no no, you can't stay, just finish now'. He did and then he laid on top of me.

I felt frozen and shocked. It's like my body knew what happened before my brain could comprehend it. I shoved him off me and he scoffed, thinking it was rude. I then broke down in tears and he was kind of angry/ annoyed about it? I asked him to leave. I was so confused and didn't know why I was sobbing, but he eventually left. The next day he texted me asking if I was okay, and I was still confused but didn't want to offend him or make him hate me. He asked if I enjoyed
""the requested creampie"" and I said ""yeah, but I think I was too sick to fully enjoy it"". I knew I didn't want it to happen but I was grappling with what occurred and kept thinking that it couldn't have been SA since I let it happen (I now know that's not always true). When I reread the messages I realise that message from him was calculated, knowing my naivety and people pleasing tendencies, my response would've ruined my credibility. I hate myself for not realising this sooner. I eventually stopped replying and when he kept texting, I told him I felt pressured to have sex and no longer wanted to continue the relationship.

Over the next few months I had nightmares, panic attacks and felt so disgusting and worthless. I went into fight or flight mode whenever I saw him in the office. I was a shell of a person and couldn't make sense of how I was feeling. I knew I had been violated but it was difficult for me to truly admit that. I was scared I wouldn't be believed and I'd jeopardise my job if l ever reported it, so l pushed the trauma down and tried to rationalise it.

10 months later I had to go to a work event with my family and heard he might've been there. I wanted to know beforehand so l wasn't triggered by seeing him. I also wanted closure and thought that the only way for me to heal was to forgive him, so I asked if he was going. We spoke briefly, not sexual or anything, just polite conversation. He was on leave at the time. At the end of the conversation I said perhaps we can catch up when he returns. My thought process at the time was that l'd get coffee, get closure and make sure that I wasn't scared of him anymore, as I hadn't seen him around in a while. Then I could forgive him.

A month later I started seeing someone and told John it wouldn't be appropriate to catch up, and then another month after that, I realised that what he did to me completely destroyed my self worth and derailed my life so significantly that he DID NOT deserve my forgiveness. So I sent a final text telling him that I would never forgive him for what he did to me that night and to stay out of my way in the workplace. I haven't spoken to him since.

Fast forward to now: I finally gained the courage to report it. I showed the messages to the MH counselor who pushed me to do it, as she believed the messages were concerning and enough proof to have action taken. I didn't think anyone would believe or take me seriously because I let it happen and was too nice about it afterwards. I have PTSD from him now and I spent so long burying and minimising the trauma to cope. I truly do believe it was sexual assault. I'm in the early stages of the reporting, and I'm scared. I'm scared people won't count it as SA since I fawned, and all the other details too. It's so damning though, especially for a cop, to be pressuring me to continue with the plans, and even drink alcohol, after I told him I was extremely unwell, on heavy medication that made me drowsy, and that I wanted to reschedule/wasn't up to it. Surely that's enough?

Please tell me if I'm crazy? I know how it made me feel and it destroyed me. I'm scared others won't consider this sexual assault.

Even if that's the case, surely I have enough grounds to get justice, even if it's just as misconduct and not criminal proceedings?",1,1752241015.0,rapecounseling,1,1.0,False

It was the entrance steps, the shady courtyard, and the front chair brought out each morning to face the street. It was the corner of the kafeneio, the patch of shade outside the minimarket, the square in front of the church after liturgy. It was the unspoken, lived-in, socially vital ritual of sitting outside and watching life go by.

1lx729z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1lx729z/explore_nespresso_vertuo_next_coffee_maker_by/,Explore Nespresso Vertuo Next Coffee Maker by De'Longhi: Is It Worth It?,"Testing out the Nespresso Vertuo Next ENV120BM coffee maker felt like stepping into a world where my morning ritual was elevated by technology and innovation. Its sleek black matte design immediately caught my eye, blending effortlessly with my kitchen’s minimalistic theme. For someone who relies on that first, glorious cup of coffee to kickstart the day, this machine had high expectations to meet. And truthfully, it managed to deliver on many fronts—although not without some quirks along the way.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**  
Sitting at just 5.5 inches wide and 14 inches in length, this machine is impressively compact for a coffee maker that promises so much. It snugly fits on my crowded kitchen counter without monopolizing precious space, a feature apartment dwellers like myself will appreciate. The matte black finish adds a touch of modern elegance. That said, its lightweight build did make me question durability. While it doesn’t feel like it would crumble under pressure, I found myself handling it with caution—especially during setup.

**Brewing Technology That Stands Out**  
The Nespresso Vertuo Next coffee maker isn't your run-of-the-mill espresso machine. It's powered by Centrifusion technology, which blends coffee and water by spinning the capsule at high speeds. This method consistently produced smooth coffee with a layer of velvety crema so thick I felt like I was being served at a cozy European café. All it required was inserting a capsule, pressing a button, and waiting a minute or so. However, the barcode-scanning technology that adjusts brewing parameters to match the capsule was both a blessing and a curse. While I loved the precision of the brewing process, this feature also meant being confined to using Nespresso-branded Vertuo capsules, limiting flexibility.  

**Positives**  
This machine’s strengths can’t go unmentioned:  
- One-touch operation makes it extremely user-friendly.  
- Offers a range of drink sizes—from 5oz shots to a hefty 18oz coffee.  
- The complementary capsule set provided a fantastic chance to try various flavors, each unique and flavorful.  

[View Nespresso Vertuo Next ENV120BM sale info on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b08gl2nj2y/)  

**Energy Efficiency and Sustainability**  
I particularly enjoyed how environmentally conscious this coffee maker claims to be. It's made of 54% recycled materials, which aligns beautifully with my effort to adopt more eco-friendly products. The removable water tank is straightforward to refill, and the automatic shut-off feature ensures no unnecessary electricity is consumed on busy mornings when I forget to turn it off. Additionally, Nespresso’s recycling program for capsules adds another point to its sustainability appeal. Still, it should be noted that the aluminum capsules, while recyclable, require active effort to return for recycling, which may not suit everyone’s routine.

**Disadvantages**  
Naturally, there are a few less favorable aspects worth highlighting:  
- The coffee maker is exclusively compatible with Vertuo capsules, making it difficult for fans of third-party blends.  
- I noticed that while brewing was usually quick, the machine could be a bit noisy, which might bother some early risers.  
- Occasionally, the barcode reading mechanism had trouble recognizing a capsule, resulting in a few frustrating moments where I had to reinstate the pod multiple times.  

**Peer Products**  
If you’re contemplating other options, investing in a Keurig K-Elite or Breville Barista Express might be worth considering. Each has its niche. Where the Keurig offers compatibility with a broader range of pods, including non-proprietary brands, the Breville provides more control for enthusiasts who desire manual brewing options. However, neither comes close to the Nespresso’s signature crema or its sleek capsule-specific technology. What the Vertuo Next lacks in flexibility, it makes up for with the quality of its coffee—assuming you're okay with sticking to its capsule ecosystem.

**Smart Spending**  
While the price of the Vertuo Next fluctuates, it aligns pretty well with offerings in the premium single-serve coffee maker category. Factoring in the included Aeroccino3 milk frother, which makes creating both hot and cold milk froth a breeze, it does deliver respectable value. Still, recurring expenses like capsules can add up quickly. Over time, this cost efficiency may balance out better for those who are loyal to the Nespresso ecosystem and seek high-quality coffee at their fingertips.

1lx71ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lx71ve/how_does_the_aroma_awk1810sd_electric_kettle/,How does the AROMA AWK-1810SD Electric Kettle Perform for Tea Lovers?,"The Aroma AWK-1810SD caught my eye for its sleek stainless-steel design and promises of rapid boiling power. As someone who practically lives off tea and coffee and refuses to wait forever for water to boil on the stovetop, I knew I needed to put it to the test. Over the past month, this kettle has seen everything from morning oatmeal to piping hot ramen—and a whole lot of tea in between. Here's the full breakdown of my experience with this digital kettle.

**Stylish Design with Practical Features**  
Visually, this electric kettle looks right at home on my kitchen countertop. The brushed stainless steel finish not only gives it an upscale vibe but is also refreshingly easy to clean. Its compact dimensions (8.63"" L x 5.75"" W x 9.63"" H) make it easy to tuck into tight spaces, though I don’t bother hiding it because it looks pretty sharp. I particularly appreciated the detachable tea filter that came with it, which makes steeping loose-leaf tea extra convenient. It’s evident that every feature of this kettle has been designed with thoughtfulness in mind, from the cordless base to the handy cord wrap for storage.

**Upsides**
- Programmable digital controls for precision.  
- Keep Warm mode maintains the ideal temperature for an hour.  
- High wattage (1500W) ensures impressively rapid boiling.  

[Check Aroma AWK-1810SD price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b09zkhhky8/)  

**User-Focused Performance**  
The performance of this kettle is where it truly shines. It’s fast—I’m talking under five minutes to boil a full pot (1.7 liters) of water. The digital controls let me set the exact temperature I need, which turned out to be a game-changer for my green tea obsession. No more scalding the leaves with boiling water! Then, there’s the Keep Warm mode. You’d think this would be just a nice-to-have feature, but trust me when I say it keeps your water precisely warm without overheating. Whether I’m preparing a second round of tea or an instant soup, the water is always ready and waiting.

**Target Users in Mind**  
If you're someone who values convenience and precision in your kitchen gadgets, this electric kettle fits the bill. It’s perfect for busy mornings, frequent tea drinkers, and anyone who finds joy in having customizable temperature settings. My tea-loving coworker borrowed it for a few days and said she didn’t know she needed this level of control until now. That said, I could also see this being excellent for families with varied needs—like making oatmeal for one and coffee for another.

**Good Points**  
- Built-in tea filter simplifies steeping loose-leaf tea.  
- Automatic shut-off ensures safety when reaching set temperatures.  
- Cordless pouring makes serving hassle-free and tidy.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The stainless steel exterior, while attractive, can get hot to the touch during use.  
- The display isn’t very bright, which can make it hard to read in low light.  
- Some users may find the audible alert tones too loud.

**Competing Products in the Market**  
Though the AWK-1810SD has a lot going for it, there are other solid products in the electric kettle arena. For instance, the Fellow Stagg EKG kettle offers a similarly sleek design but comes with a precision pour spout for coffee aficionados. It’s also a favorite of pour-over enthusiasts, but it costs significantly more and doesn’t include a Keep Warm function. On the flip side, the Hamilton Beach Glass Electric Kettle looks visually stunning with its illuminated boiling feature and comes at a slightly more affordable price. However, it doesn’t give the same level of control over temperature settings or include a built-in tea filter, which makes the Aroma feel like more of a complete package for households with diverse hot beverage needs.

**Smart Spending**  
When I weighed the features against other electric kettles in this price range, the AWK-1810SD proved to be an excellent option. Its programmable settings and safety-focused design make the slightly higher price tag worth it for daily use. While it’s not the cheapest kettle out there, the added convenience and functionality easily make up for it. If I had to nitpick, I’d say that its rapid boiling and user-friendly design add unparalleled value compared to competing brands in its range.

I recently discovered the **Third Wave Coffee** app and heard they offer ₹100 off for new users if you sign up using a **referral code**. I’ve seen some chatter about it on Reddit, but I couldn’t find a working code that still gives the discount.

So I thought I’d ask here — if anyone has a valid Third Wave referral code that’s worked recently in **India**, please do drop it below. I know many of us are looking for a Third Wave referral code free, especially when ordering for the first time.

Also, while checking out the app, I got curious about their **birthday offer** — here’s what I found after digging a bit:

**Third Wave Coffee Birthday Offer (India) – How It Works:**

* The birthday beverage is available only during your birthday month.
* You must have spent a minimum of ₹500 on the app in the past 12 months to be eligible.
* If you sign up during your birthday month, you won’t get the offer immediately — it kicks in from the next year’s birthday.
* If the offer has already been claimed or expired, it won’t appear in the app.
* Starting February 2025, the birthday drink will be limited to Regular Size Classic Beverages only (Code: BIRTHDAY).
* They don’t accept cafe reservations for parties, but you can check with the store manager for any informal arrangements.

I thought this info might help others who are also checking out Third Wave Coffee India for the first time — especially with so many people searching for things like a Third Wave referral code reddit, how to get ₹100 off, or what the birthday beverage policy really is.

If anyone has a working code, do share. Thanks in advance! ☕✨",12,1752240429.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

For a while, I felt like I was just paying for two very similar services.

That changed this week.

I had to analyse a chaotic 30-page Google Doc transcript from a client workshop and summarize the key action items into a Google Sheet. My first instinct was to copy-paste chunks into ChatGPT, which was a nightmare of formatting errors and context loss.

On a whim, I opened Gemini and used the @ extension. I just typed: summarise the key decisions and action items from @\[Workshop Transcript Doc\] and put them in a table with columns for 'Decision,' 'Owner,' and 'Deadline'.

I clicked enter and went to make coffee. When I came back, it had produced a near-perfect summary, correctly identifying the nuanced points and assigning tentative owners based on the conversation flow. I then told it to create a Google Sheet from this table, and it did. Instantly.

This wasn't just a summary; it was a complete workflow automation that saved me at least two hours of tedious administrative hell. It's not a flashy feature you see in demos, but the ability to seamlessly pull from, understand, and create new files within your own Google ecosystem is an absolute game-changer. It feels less like a chatbot and more like a true digital assistant.

Is anyone else finding these deep integrations to be the main reason they're sticking with Gemini? It feels like Google's real, defensible advantage.",9,1752240420.0,GeminiAI,1,1.0,False

I mean, just think about it for a second.

The speed was basically instantaneous. You can't get that with a round-trip to a server farm a thousand miles away. That has to be the next-gen, hyper-efficient on-device model they've been promising.

Some thoughts I guess, for anyone considering getting started.

*  You will eat today.
*  Thinking about it is the worst thing... Day's are slow, weeks are fast.
*  You WILL eat today. That's guaranteed. With that in mind it's to put hunger to one side.
*  Weigh yourself and log it every single day. It will desensitise you from the swings.
*  One day off isn't going to derail everything.
*  It's actually really hard to eat your BMR in a single sitting, unless you're actively eating bad food.
*  Zero calorie fizzy drinks during the day can make you feel fuller than black coffee, and give you that ""sweet hit"".
*  You WILL eat today.
*  Don't eat back your exercise calories - you'll always overestimate them and could actually end up eating maintenance.
*  Walking is your friend. An hour a day is an extra 1400 calories over a week - an entire day's worth of calories.
*  You WILL eat, today. Later. Soon. In a bit.
*  Don't also start substituting low-fat versions of things. You'll feel like you're depriving yourself and it'll be harder to do.
*  You can have nice things on a weekend. Beer, pizza. Just as long as it's OMAD and you understand the impact it'll have on your calories.
*  Don't tell people about OMAD. Everyone suddenly becomes an expert and tells you how unhealthy it is, or how you're starving yourself, or how they could never do it because X Y Z... it's not worth it.
*  ... you will eat today.

In a bold attempt to firmly plant their flag on the AI landscape, Sinclair has rolled out the red carpet for artificial intelligence with the introduction of the AI Excellence Institute. This initiative isn't just about dabbling in AI; they're diving headfirst into integrating it into every nook and cranny of campus life over the next three years.

**Faculty & Student Dynamics: The AI Balancing Act**
Dr. Christina Amato, the ever-enthusiastic dean of eLearning, is spearheading this AI revolution. Let’s be honest: implementing AI on such a scale means more than just fetching robots that brew coffee or grade papers. Amato’s team has been carefully crafting this operation for the last three years, like strategic chess players plotting their moves well in advance. They’ve recognized the challenges—like ensuring professors aren’t left bumbling around trying to code in BASIC while AI zips ahead at warp speed.

Katie Gray, a sophomore with her finger on the pulse, humorously pointed out, ""We’re working with a generation that might still struggle with Instagram filters, let alone advanced AI tech!"" But Amato remains optimistically skeptical, advocating for a flexible approach where questions drive learning. This, she believes, will bridge the gap between AI potential and faculty tech-savviness. 

**AI: A Present Force, Not a Distant Mirage**
Steve Johnson, Sinclair's president and CEO, wasted no time in calling AI what it is—a force reshaping educational and professional landscapes right now. But as promising as this AI venture sounds, students are understandably cautious, fearing a future where technology races ahead, leaving both educators and students scrambling to catch up.

So, WYSO readers, here's the kicker: Should AI-driven education lean heavily on embedding intelligence within faculties, or should we focus on enhancing intuitive, tech-savvy curriculums for students?

He was so unscientific in that analysis and parroted a lot of dumb black pill talking points…,"The survey was asking women if on any occasion they’d reported men to an authority figure for approaching them, and what that situation was.  20% of women said yes they had, and 70% of those were in a work or school context.

Dr. K somehow extrapolated from this that if you approach a woman as a man in 2025, there’s a 20% chance an authority figure will get called on you.  That’s just not what it was saying at all… and is driving his audience more towards these black pill beliefs that there’s something inherently wrong with talking to women irl.  What the survey was saying that on one (or more) SINGLE OCCASION women reported someone, 50% of the time to HR.

From my own experience of having dove down the pickup artist rabbit hole (before recently chilling out and trying to go with the flow a little more)…. I don’t think getting reported to the authorities is something men should be particularly worried about when meeting women irl.  I’ve done at least 1000 approaches, and in hindsight did a lot of ones that were awkward or even downright creepy (I’ve tried my best to learn lessons and improve so women feel more safe around me)… and if I’d ever had an authority figure called on me… it’s news to me.  I’d talk to girls at coffee shops, museums, parks, book stores, the collaborative sections of libraries, etc… and not once was I ever approached by an authority figure for doing so.  

Why?  Because women typically aren’t reporting harmless short interactions that don’t involve power dynamics to the authorities.  If you approach with respect, don’t go over the line in being touch or sexually suggestive, and take no with respect and finality… you should be ok.  Women are typically only going to authority figures for (a) persistent harassment, (b) highly sexual approaches that make them uncomfortable, (c) situations involving people with power over them at work demanding something of them.

So guys… I wouldn’t recommend approaching 1000 women and going down the PUA rabbit hole… it had a lot of negative effects on my I’m still trying to pull myself out of.  But ffs, if once every couple of weeks you’re out and about in a safe public location and see a girl who has somewhat approachable body language/no headphones… don’t be afraid to go for it!

Tess passed away after a courageous battle with hemangiosarcoma, an aggressive blood-vessel cancer known as the 'silent killer' because it usually shows no symptoms until its too late. Despite being 2/3rd pitbull, her DNA test indicated she was approximately 16% golden retriever, a breed commonly plagued by this. The diagnosis came out of the blue on 6/26/25 after an episode forced her parents to rush her to urgent care to perform an emergency life-saving procedure to have blood drawn from the sac around her heart. She had a normal day prior to the episode and we are grateful to have been given 8 additional days to love and spoil her, as many with this diagnosis do not get this borrowed time.

Tess graduated from the PetSmart University training class, in Lawnside NJ, where she learned commands and made some friends. While in NJ, Tess enjoyed visiting breweries, going to Longport Dog Beach, taking a stroll around ‘Goose Poop Pond’ (Cooper River Park), and spending time outside with her parents. She had a 100' dog runner that ran the entire length of the backyard, and would often sprint full speed to the back if she sensed a bunny or gopher was in her yard. She went on two 1 mile walks a day for the entirety of her life, and never let snow, rain, heat, deter her. “Do You Wanna” typically prompted a floppy-eared head tilt, and we didn’t even need to finish the sentence with “Go on a walk” before she was excitedly getting her leash attached. It is estimated that over the course of her nearly 9 years, she walked over 6,500 miles just on walks. She also traveled to 7 states, and visited a dozen different beaches.

In August of 2020, Tess was in her humans' wedding and we were all excited that ""The Party of 3"" were able to be together on this special day. The grooms sister walked Tess down the aisle with an “I Do Too” bandana. 

In August of 2021, The Party of 3 moved to Charleston SC, so they could do more of the things they already learned they love doing together.  By living in a place that had better weather, they would be able to be outside and go to the beach more frequently. Immediately after moving in, Tess finally got a fenced in yard, and there was a 2nd story covered porch and covered patio. The Party of 3 would often sit outside for hours, just listening to music, enjoying cocktails or coffee, talking to each other, and loving life.  Tess’ favorite places to go in SC were the Ashley Greenway, aka “2 poop park” because Tess would get so excited she would poop twice, and Beachwalker Park on Kiawah island.

Tess’ incredible demeanor made her parents want to do more for the pitbull community. So, we decided to foster a dog through an over-crowded local shelter, and took Tess to meet a few. We brought one home who was malnourished and heartworm positive, and over the next couple months, rehabbed him to a healthy weight and HW negativity. Completely unexpectedly, less than a couple months later, Chase, a slightly younger male pitbull, was adopted by one of our close family matters. How incredibly rewarding, now Tess and Chase got to be pals and see each other constantly. After the success we found, we ended up fostering 2 additional dogs, both of which came from abuse-case situations and were heartworm positive. Tess was the foundation for saving those fosters, and was graciously hospitable to other dogs while they lived with us. Tess would share her beds, her toys, and her mom and dad’s attention, knowing that there was always plenty to go around.

We request that on her behalf, you pick 1 day within the next month, and spend a few hours taking a pitbull or pitmix that is currently confined to a life in a shelter, out on a day date. Most shelters allow this, it costs nothing but time, and we can virtually guarantee that 3 things will happen if you do:

1. Any misguided or unfounded opinions you had about pitbulls will be quickly erased, once you experience how gentle, playful, and sweet they are.
2. Any sense for wanting to do more with your time, will quickly be discovered.
3. Years from now, even if you only do it once, it’ll undoubtedly be a memory that lives on, fondly.

Tess’ legacy will live on as we continue to search for ways we can help tip the scales of imbalance even slightly more in the favor of pitbulls. Thank you for your time, and for continuing to save and help the breeds that need it most.",65,1752239219.0,DOG,4,0.97,False

Outside of studying I’m into the visiting the ocean, kayaking, skiing, random road trips, and finding places with good food and drinks. I like sci-fi, horror, and wholesome shows, I enjoy open-ended conversations about science or weird ideas. I was also hoping to start playing tennis? If anyone does that? Or even just some type of weekly activity or club maybe. 

I’m not looking for big parties more interested in meeting one or two people who like to actually talk or do something fun (walks, coffee, a show, kayaking, anything that isn’t forced small talk).

1lx6eeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1lx6eeu/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1lx6ebl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lx6ebl,Made a minimalist tile-sliding math puzzle (Android) — would love some honest feedback,"Hey all,

I've been working on a mobile puzzle game in my spare time called Numino. It’s a simple, minimalist idea where you slide number and operator tiles to build valid equations. Sort of like a mix between math puzzles and those old sliding tile games.

The goal was to create something you could play in short bursts—on a coffee break, during downtime at work, or while commuting. Something light but with enough logic to scratch the brain a little. It's free and works offline, so I thought it might be a good fit for people who enjoy clean, focused puzzle experiences without all the fluff.

I’d really appreciate any feedback—good or bad. Especially curious whether the idea makes sense, and if it actually feels satisfying to solve. I’m not trying to promote anything here, just hoping to improve the game and hear from folks who enjoy this kind of thing.

If you're up for it, here's the Play Store link:

1lx6e7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lx6e7v/assess_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Assess the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Breville Vertuo Worth It,"Breville Vertuo – this coffee and espresso machine has been part of my daily routine ever since I decided to upgrade my morning brew experience. I was initially drawn to its automatic functionality and sleek black design, but after weeks of use, I can say there's a lot more to unpack about this product.

**Sleek Design with Practical Features**  
The black exterior of this single-serve brewer feels modern and blends seamlessly into any kitchen decor. Its compact dimensions (10.75 x 14 x 14.5 inches) make it a great fit even for countertop spaces that are somewhat limited. The removable 40 oz. water tank is a thoughtful design consideration, allowing for easy refills without the awkward spills some other coffee makers have put me through. It strikes the right balance between design aesthetics and usefulness, which is something I genuinely appreciate as someone who used to wrestle with clunky machines in the morning.

**Winning Points**  
- Removable tank for ease of refilling.  
- Compact and stylish design.  
- A versatile solution for multiple brew sizes.  

[Find the best price for Breville Vertuo on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07qk26f64/)

**Performance That Delivers Every Morning**  
The product really shines with its ability to produce barista-grade coffee or espresso at the press of a button. Nespresso’s Centrifusion technology is impressive, utilizing barcodes on the capsules to customize brewing for each type of coffee. I’ve tried everything from a quick espresso shot to a large 14 oz. cup of coffee, and it’s always brewed with a perfect crema layer on top. It's fast too—just 15 seconds of heat-up time, which is a game-changer on rushed mornings. I even tossed in some ice to experiment with cold brews, and the machine didn’t miss a beat.  

**Versatility in Brewing Sizes**  
I’m someone who switches up their coffee preferences regularly, and the machine accommodates that perfectly. It offers five brewing sizes: Espresso (1.35 oz.), Double Espresso (2.7 oz.), Gran Lungo (5 oz.), Coffee (7.7 oz.), and Alto (14 oz.). The variety is especially nice when I have guests over, each with their own distinct caffeine demands. Plus, the capsules themselves are diverse in aromatic profiles, making the experience exciting every day.

**Delicious Capsules, But Limited Options**  
The included welcome kit of 12 capsules was a nice touch. They showcased different aroma profiles, which I found to be not only tasty but also a great introduction to what the machine is capable of. That said, I noticed that this coffee maker exclusively works with Nespresso Vertuo capsules, and while they’re high-quality, they limit flexibility if you’re someone who prefers other types of coffee grounds or pods. It’s worth considering before committing.

**Hurdles**  
- Limited to Nespresso Vertuo capsules.  
- Can be inconvenient for those who prefer freshly ground coffee.  

**Competitors in the Coffee-Crafting Arena**  
It’s only fair to stack this brewer up against other premium single-serve machines in the market, like the Keurig K-Elite or the Cuisinart SS-15. The Keurig offers an equally fast brewing process and is compatible with a broader variety of pods, which might be more appealing for coffee enthusiasts who like options. However, it doesn’t match the consistency of crema or the Centrifusion technology that this coffee maker provides. Cuisinart’s dual coffee and espresso capabilities are commendable, but its larger footprint and slightly slower heating time make it a bit less appealing on busy mornings. For its size and technology, I would argue the Vertuo stands strong in terms of coffee quality and ease of use.

**Affordable Quality for Coffee Enthusiasts**  
Considering the quality of brew it provides, I’d say this machine offers excellent value for money. You’re investing in a product designed for longevity, ease of use, and—most importantly—a great coffee experience. Sure, the capsules dictate ongoing costs, but for someone like me who values convenience and premium coffee, it feels like a justified spend. Again, it really depends on whether you’re okay sticking to their capsule ecosystem or crave a little more freedom to experiment.

1lx6dmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1lx6dmq/friend_going_through_psychosis/,Friend going through psychosis,"My friend (25m) started experiencing psychosis around a week ago. Looks like it was caused by him completely putting away weed, alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, and his ADHD meds. He decided he wants to get ""clean"" and acted like it caused him to reach some sort of enlightenment. At that point though, my friend group didn't really read the signs, as he always acted a bit erratic. 

In the span of 24h, his personality shifted dramatically, and he started accusing his two best girlfriends of manipulating everyone against him, plotting a big scheme to use him and destroy him. During that time, he has sent them hundreds of really long, severly verbally abusive and aggressive texts, after which they started  seriously fearing for their safety.

He also texted other people in my friendgroup with very heavy, verbally abusive stuff. Even if he wasn't receiving responses, he would text non-stop throught 2 whole nights, long and very charged messages. He also didn't sleep during that time.

After he finally crashed out on our groupchat, again verbally abusing and being very aggressive about the whole situation and sharing very personal details about the two girls, he was ultimately kicked out. We kept in contact with his mother, though, and tried to get her to admit him to a psych ward. For one day, nothing has changed, as he was let out from the psych ward because of high thc level in blood (I have no idea how that is supposed to make sense:))

Finally, after again bombarding my friend with messages today, she threatened to file a police report, and we received information that he was admitted to the hospital against his will.

Now, I don't really know what to do. My friendgroup is divided, and the situation has taken a toll on everyone's mental health. We have known each other for about 7 years, and have been really close. During the last two years, we knew that my friend's mental health was getting worse - and there were multiple interventions and talks, as my friend refused to go to therapy despite being on ADHD medication. He was always a bit narcissistic and stubborn and never listened to the advice, despite our continous efforts. He also started abusing alcohol, and weed more severly (he was already smoking since I know him).
Ultimately, I can see how all that led to a psychotic break and I am trying to understand that it is not the real him.

That said, the severety of his aggression and insults was terrifying: in a way, I don't know how much of that is psychosis, and how much is rooted in his real beliefs about us. The things that he has written are very narcissistic, dark, hateful and heavy, and as a person also struggling with mental health, I don't know how to be a good friend in this situation. I don't even know if I could look him in the face again. 

I am reading lots of other stories and experiences that people went through, and I really feel for him - but also, I think other people in my friendgroup might not have so much empathy, especially the ones that he attacked personally. I don't blame them at all - but without us, he has no one, even though he might not realize it.

I am glad that he was finally admitted and will get the professional help that he needs, but how do we even go from here? 

Thank you if you made it to the end - I would love to hear other people's perspectives or thoughts, wether if it was you dealing with psychosis, or a loved one.

Hey everyone,

I just booked a stay at the Southernmost Resort for the second week of August, and just saw a posts about sargassum and the smell ruining the experience.

My hubby and I are traveling with another couple, and we're mostly going for a relaxing vacation. We have a fishing charter set up and we love the sound and view of the ocean. I didn’t realize the seaweed could be such an issue this time of year, especially with the smell people are mentioning.

How bad is it really? I’m a texas girl and we have seaweed here but it kind of sounds like the smell of the decay is horrendous. Would you recommend sticking with the Southernmost or looking into staying elsewhere? I was looking forward to using our balcony, having coffee in the morning watching the ocean. Honestly an escape from reality.  

Any locals or recent visitors who can share what they’ve experienced in August would be hugely appreciated!

1lx6a0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1lx6a0h/end_times_larp/,End Times LARP,"One of my biggest frustrations with my experience at a ROCOR parish (10 years) is how much it felt like an End Times cult by the end. It felt like every coffee hour was full of people talking about how they're homesteading and stocking up weapons and food for ""what's about to happen"" - don't get me wrong, I'm from a rural background and I think homesteading is neat, it's just the context that's weird here. Young men at the parish would buy Russian military uniforms and pose with guns and those weird ""Orthodoxy or Death"" flags. The families would scoff and say ""well when the End Times are here you'll come crawling to us and our homestead!"" if you ever thought it was a bit obsessive that it was such a hot topic so often. Everyone was obsessed with Revelations. It seemed to be a very large part of the parish culture by the end of my time there. It felt like everyone wanted to imagine themselves as the only good, true, well-prepared Christians that were going to be the big herous and save everyone when the End Times came. ROCOR seems uniquely obsessed with this but I have seen it in other jurisdictions also, although generally other ones feel less cultish. Serbs could care less though lol, always recommend them to inquirers because they're by far the most normal ones. 

Editing this to say that COVID was really where I saw the change. Everyone was salivating over the idea that they're uniquely oppressed at that time. Everyone thought it was the mark of the beast and blah blah - before this there was some End Times obsession but this superpowered it. Lo and behold, years later society is back to normal, and none of these people were rounded up and sent to FEMA camps. But the End Times obsession stayed. ",7,1752238815.0,exorthodox,0,1.0,False

   I’m currently three days into a drunken bender. Drinking myself stupid while playing PlayStation or watching YouTube on the couch. Anything to stay numb and distracted from my life for just a few more days. The tv illuminates my dark and musty living room. My beloved couch, riddled with stains from drinks and food grease, has also been serving as my bed. While in the middle of a game my vision blurred as I briefly went cross eyed and began vomiting all over the coffee table in front of me. I stared into the foamy yellow puddle, my mind trying its hardest to still the spinning room. “I gotta get some water in me” I said through a slurred mumble. I sat up from the couch and stumbled my way to the kitchen walking as if the individual tiles on the floor were trying to slide out from under my feet. I grabbed an old half finished water bottle off the counter and began opening it when there was a sudden knock at the door.

   “JESUS”! I yelled as I wobbled in place. I turned and stared at the door for a minute before shakily calling out. “Hello”? I paused for a moment before glancing over to the clock by the tv that read 3:43am. I stepped closer to the door. “Who’s there”?.. There was no reply and I’m sure as hell not about to open it. Even drunk I’ve seen way too many movies to make that mistake. After a minute of silence I shrugged and turned back towards the kitchen. Three more knocks came even louder than the last. I flinched and dropped my water to the ground splashing my feet. “Ah come on man, hey!! Who is it that? Who’s there”?

   There are two windows on either side of my front door but they’re the type of frosted glass that’s made to where you can’t see through. It’s only now that I’ve noticed how damn pointless they are. “Juss keep on movin, buddy! I’ve got a gun so take your pranks elsewhere” I said knowing full damn well the only weapon in this place is a fat glass lamp. 

   It’s been eerily quiet for a few minutes now other than a faint scratching sound that happened so softly I wasn’t sure if I was actually hearing it at all. I let out a short frustrated breath and started to step back. Half way into the step I heard a woman’s voice at the door. “James? James, honey”? All at once the world fell from under me. My eyes shifted back to the door and I could see a silhouette in the window. I tried to deny it but I could never mistake that voice. The voice of my mother.. who we had buried four days ago.

   “James.. James open the door. It’s cold out here”. A wave of goosebumps formed all over my body and my breath grew quick and panicked as if I had fallen into ice. The silhouette certainly resembled her but it was twitching in short frequent bursts. And the head.. It seemed as if it were stretching out in different areas. A hand slapped against the glass and I fell backwards scrambling to get back up. I ran upstairs as quickly as I could while the entire house exploded with deafening bangs against the door that quickly spread to the walls and windows. 

   I slammed the door to my room shut and simultaneously the house fell silent. I slumped down with my back against the door, my heart beating out of my chest, my mind trying to form one coherent thought. I fumbled for my phone and called my sister. “.. Hello”? I heard through a rough yawn. “ALEXIS” I yelled. “It’s mom or or I think it’s- it’s not- I mean it can’t be but“ 
Alexis interrupted: “Mom? What are you talking about James? Are you drunk again? This isn’t fucking funny”. 

   “Alexis please just listen to me! There’s someone, someTHING, outside my house and.. and it’s trying to get in”! There was a long pause on the other line that slowly filled with a faint static. “Shes coming in, James”.

“I… what”? I slowly pulled the phone from my ear. “Lex…”? On the phone I could hear distant labored breathing accompanied by the sound of a doorknob turning.

   As the sound of a door opening creaked through the phone I could also hear the front door from downstairs. I dropped the phone and began barricading my bedroom door. A large chair, my dresser, the damn lamp! Anything that could possibly add more security between me and whatever was now walking up the stairs. “James, dear. Where arrrrrrrre youuuuuu”? Creaks from the stairs filled whatever silence wasn’t occupied by my mother’s voice. My legs buckled as I backed away and my shorts grew warmer and wet. Like a frightened child with zero sense I jumped into my bed, all rational thought left behind as I wrapped myself in the sheets. 

   I’ve always wondered how I would face a fight or flight, near death experience. In my head I had always painted myself as the hero or survivor. Calm, brave, knowing exactly how to handle the situation. But now I know. I’ve been plunged into an indescribable, primal fear and am now cowering in my bed waiting for certain death. I stare at the door listening to it walk by taunting me with the voice of who I cherished most in this world. What made it worse was how happy and comforting it seemed.

   A shadow stops in front of my room and the handle gently turns but fails to open. Three small knocks echo in the room. “Open the door James”. A harsh thud slams into the door making the hinges squeal and the barricade shake. The voice called out again never changing its cheerful motherly tone. “Let me in, James! I need to get in, I need to get in, I need to get in, I need to get in”! It repeated itself endlessly as the knocking and ramming grew more and more intense. It rattled my head so much I vomited again in to the sheets I had cocooned myself in. I threw the sheets over my head and shook in the fetal position until the room was once again silent.

   I peeked out half expecting to see whatever it was standing in the doorway but there was nothing. The shadow was gone and the barricade still intact, the only sound being my quiet but panicked breaths. I swallowed what little spit I had in my dry mouth, my eyes unable to blink or leave the door until something caught their attention. In my peripherals I spotted the crack in my closet door grow wider.

   Once more I ducked back under the sheets my whole body clinched and vibrating with sweat. The bed’s surface shifted as a new weight was added to the mattress. A horrific and yet somehow calming sense of numbness took over as I felt a  cold hand perch itself on my shoulder.

The WORST SCORERS:  Now comes everyone's favorite part of the report - the list of Rotten Restaurants who scored worse than 85.  I don't post any place that scores 85 or above even if they were the worst inspections for a particular week.  85 is a solid B and I don't want to shame them.  


-----------------------






none this week





-----------------------
 

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.


bb - bed and breakfast?

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

tf - traveler's accommodation

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

I’m 27 years old, born and raised in Jeddah. I run my own business here, and life’s been good, but most of my close friends have moved away for work or studies. I’m hoping to meet some new people who are also looking to hang out, grab coffee, or try out some cool activities around the city.

I’m pretty chill and open-minded. I’m into exploring new cafes, casual meetups, and maybe trying stuff like road trips, hiking, beaches– whatever sounds fun really. Whether you're local or new in town, it’d be great to connect.

Drop a message if you’re down to hang out or even just chat. Let’s make Jeddah a little less quiet!

1lx63ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/seroquelmedication/comments/1lx63ey/nicotine_tolerance_through_the_roof_and_caffeine/,Nicotine tolerance through the roof. And caffeine and alcohol also.,"Pretty simple, I've been on Seroquel for 3 months now @200mg a day, and the nasty side effects have gone finaly (constipation- an absolute nightmare for the first couple months, confusion). One strange effect of the medication however is my tollerance to drugs.


I should preface by saying I already have a high tollerance to nicotine and alcohol (I'm an alcoholic). However whereas before I would get through a tin of nicotine pouches every other day (strong mg would be enough, I have been using them since covid), these days I have to take two extra strongs at the same time. I can vape also with these pouches in at the same time, its absurd (no nic sickness). Cigarettes still hit the spot thankfully but I try not to smoke too often. 


Caffeine is a weird one, I've gone on and off addiction wise to coffee, generally for atleast a few years caffeine would me anxious and jittery. Now I can drink crazy strong amounts and it does wake me up but it doesnt make me shaky.


Alcohol is the more concerning one, (I am at the moment doing some form of detox, soon with help from local health services). I can drink a bottle of vodka a day and not really feel it at all, this is after slipping up from half the amount for months prior. The problem comes with not feeling the alcohol. Drinking beyond that amount or too quickly especially alongside taking my meds I have now blacked out a few times, never an issue before even when I was drinking a litre of spirits a day.


Anyone else have a similar experience?

Main side effects to report atm, brief nasal congestion an hour after taking, dry mouth also, both only lasting a couple of hours. Oh and also lethargy, I kinda feel like a bit of a zombie but that's kind of nice especially now its summer.

Out of **22** total respondents we had a tie for 3 winners who all got *every single question correct*!!! They are:

* u/Starfall15
* u/IraelMrad
* u/Moonrisedream42 \- who got their questionnaire submitted under the wire only a few hours ago!

u/Starfall15 was also our first 100% winner, and was only the second respondent! When I say u/fixtheblue and I got nervous about how difficult our questions were after that…hoo boy! But not to worry - there were apparently lots of tough questions! The hardest:

1. It's the pits that this movie adaptation was no Carnival cruise. - **5** of you decided NOT to even try this one, but **10** of you tried and got it wrong!
2. Wake up, the gate is burning, this is no game! - Again **8** of you didn’t want to even attempt answering this one, but another **7** got it wrong!
3. This author might have the solution to a royal issue but it takes her MCs decades, and what a price to pay for the mission! - **5** of you didn’t try this one, but **9** of you got it outright wrong (many thought it was *Realm of the Elderlings*!)

But not to worry, there were a couple easy ones in there too - ones every single person got correct!

1. One last brew with a loved one. - Did “brew” give this one away?
2. Sorry, I thought this book was simply all about medieval France's architecture? You're telling me I was supposed to have gotten something else from it? - This was my favorite one to write!
3. The horrors (literally) of working retail. Don't go searching the panopticon without your BRÄNDED tools! - Or was this one the favorite?!

This one was *almost* a full winner but **1 single person** decided not to answer this one!

1. Written as a letter, this book brings up memories out of time, and is dedicated to the author's mother.

Overall grade distribution (I will not name names) was as follows:

* 100%: **3 respondents**
* 80%+: **7 respondents**
* 50%+: **8 respondents**
* Below 50%: **4 respondents**

**All 22 participants** will find some fun emoji added to their user flair in the sub as a big THANK YOU for puzzling with us!

A couple special shout-outs as well:

* u/myneoncoffee who was our first respondent!
* u/fromdusktil who actually made me LOL with their responses to some questions (we all remember the emotional trauma that was *I Who Have Never Known Men*, right?!)

If you think this quiz was a hit, keep those brains well-read and ready for another one of these in another 6-ish months….

See you all way too soon!

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of Colombian coffee beans depends on several critical factors, including the altitude at which they are grown, the specific varietal of Arabica coffee plant, the processing method employed, and the roasting profile. Each of these factors has a notable impact on the final flavor and aroma of the coffee.

**Altitude and Growing Region:**

Colombian coffee is primarily grown in the Andean mountains, at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level. Higher altitudes result in slower bean maturation, leading to denser beans with more complex flavors. Regions like Antioquia, Huila, and Nariño are particularly celebrated for their high-altitude coffee production, contributing to the beans' characteristic brightness and sweetness. The unique combination of climate,soil,and elevation gives these regions' coffee a distinct advantage.

**Arabica Varietal (Typica, Castillo, Caturra):**

the specific varietal of Arabica bean plays a crucial role in the coffee's flavor profile. Typica, one of the oldest Arabica varietals, is known for its clean, sweet taste and balanced acidity. Caturra, a mutation of Bourbon, offers higher yields and a bright, citrusy flavor.Castillo, a more recent advancement, is prized for its resistance to coffee rust while maintaining a smooth and well-balanced taste.Farmers choose varietals based on regional conditions and desired flavor characteristics.

**Washed Processing Method:**

The washed (or wet) processing method is most commonly used for Colombian coffee. This involves removing the outer layers of the coffee cherry, fermenting the beans to remove the remaining mucilage, and then washing and drying them. This method produces a clean, bright, and consistent flavor profile, highlighting the inherent characteristics of the bean. Proper washing techniques ensure that the beans are free from defects, contributing to a smoother cup.

**Roast Profile (Light, Medium, Dark):**

The roast profile significantly impacts the final flavor of the coffee. Light roasts preserve the delicate floral and fruity notes, showcasing the bean's origin characteristics. Medium roasts offer a balanced profile with enhanced body and sweetness, ofen revealing notes of caramel and chocolate. Dark roasts develop a bolder, smoky flavor with reduced acidity, catering to those who prefer a stronger coffee experience. The roast profile should complement the bean's natural flavors.

I was baking pastries that floated a little in the low gravity, and happy astronauts stopped by for coffee and croissants. I felt completely peaceful, like I finally belonged somewhere.

In real life, I love baking as a hobby, but I don’t own a bakery (or plan to move to space!).

Could this dream be about finding my safe space or craving freedom? Has anyone had similar dreams of strange but comforting places?

We are covid students, toh anyway it's not like we had 100 college friends. It also doesn't help a socially anxious person like me. 

But trying to change that now. How you ask? 

- Removed insta from my phone. Doomscrolling on reddit instead lmao but fomo isn't bad here
- I'm taking care of my health and well being 
- I'm taking pottery classes and made a new friend. Big winnnn!!! 
- I'm going for walks to CP and adjoining areas. Solo date w good coffee and a good book. 
- I'll start my first job soon and talk to as many people possible even if my tummy feels weird or hands get clammy. Social anxiety, I'm gonna win this oneee

What's I'm looking for here? 

- A nice conversation to bring me out of my shell
- A nice friendship where we can hang out in person hopefully 
- I am a good listener. You can share or bitch or complain and I'm here to listen. Don't listen to my advice bohot bekar advice deti hu. Par dil ki achi hu lol

Hey everyone!  
I’ve always thought I loved coffee, but recently realized I actually just love *café* coffee — not the instant stuff I’ve been drinking at home. So I did some digging and decided to give specialty coffee a shot.

I picked up a Hario V60, filter papers, and a sampler pack from Blue Tokai. Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

1. **Attikan Estate** – Loved the aroma, taste was okay (didn’t hate it, just not wowed)
2. **Silver Oak Cafe Blend** – Loved both the smell *and* the taste
3. **Kalledevarapura Estate - Pulp Sun Dried** – Loved the taste, not a fan of the aroma

Based on this, I *think* I enjoy coffees that lean a bit acidic but not too bitter — though I’m still figuring it out.

Now I’m eyeing two more options from Blue Tokai that sound super interesting but sadly aren’t available in sampler size:

* **Kerehaklu Estate**
* **Riverdale Estate N72**

But here’s the dilemma:  
I don’t have a grinder. I know fresh grinding is better, but I’ve also read that unless I can get a decent grinder (and not a cheap ₹1.5k one), I’m better off sticking to pre-ground. I’m fresh out of college, and while I do have a bit of money saved from doing tech workshops, I’m not in a position to spend ₹5k+ on a grinder right now.

I usually have **one cup a day** (around 15g), so a 250g bag lasts me about **15–16 days**, which I heard is still within the “good” window for pre-ground coffee.

So… should I buy **both** coffees or just pick **one** for now?  
Any thoughts or advice from fellow home brewers would be amazing 🙌

Also would love thoughts on other coffee brands. I am from Kolkata and I can't find any local roaster. Shipping from a lot of brand will be costly for me right at this point of life (example Subko).",1,1752237852.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

Let me start with a bit from MY Fantasy Life. 

*My Hockey Mom friends were all giggling and giddy yesterday about my invitation to come over tomorrow. “I mean, we’re all girls, we can do Girl Talk, right?” Yes, we can. “What I meant was, we can talk about anything?” Absolutely, I assured them. You are all talking behind my back any way. “Well, uhmm…” more giggling. So, why not get it all out in the open?*

*Over many sessions, my therapist and I have been rehearsing for scenarios like this. On the basis of his work with many HS clients, he is convinced that until the state of the science catches up, it’s impossible to “fix” HS. “If you can’t cure it, why not “ride” it?” Walking out of the shame and into the sunlight requires internal growth. “You have to be willing to take risks and walk out of your fears.”*

*So I plan to take them to our three RVs. I will show them our “spa” RV, our “dining RV” with the two offices, and our “living RV” where we hang out, watch TV, and have coffee in the morning. How do the six kids (including Lori) sleep in their room? How do the Mamas and Papas sleep (and frolick)? Nothing hidden.*

*It doesn’t matter if you live in a Red or Blue community. Women want to talk about sexuality. I’m pretty much the expert here, aren’t I? To kind of warm us up, at hockey today I am going to ask them to help me make a list of the questions they have. I’m pretty sure I know already, but let’s get this into the open.*

*I’ve already told them about our project and I am looking for their support and votes.*

Let’s jump back into Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture. He starts the section by quoting Nichiren. Here’s the first part:

***Awed by the five proclamations of the Buddha [made in the “Treasure Tower” and “Devadatta” chapters], the countless bodhisattvas promised the Buddha that they would propagate the Lotus Sutra, as described in the “Encouraging Devotion” chapter. I will hold up this passage [twenty-line verse section] of the sutra like a bright mirror so that all may see how the present-day priests of the Zen, Precepts, and Nembutsu schools and their lay supporters are guilty of slandering the Law. 

I looked up the “twenty-line verse” article in [The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism](https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/T/302). It begins with: “We [the countless bodhisattvas and buddhas gathered] beg you not to worry. After the Buddha has passed into extinction, in an age of fear and evil we will preach far and wide.” 

Well, we certainly are living in “an age of fear and evil,” aren’t we? In response to this dire situation, those gathered promised “we will preach far and wide.”

So, phooey to the charlatans on the other side of the hedges who try to lure readers to jump off the cliff. They make a distinction between practitioners of the Lotus Sutra and those they call practicing “mainstream Buddhism.”

Hey, run away from the charlatans and don’t look back! Because something is “mainstream” it is right? Shut down those Wright Brothers when “mainstream” folk told them it’s impossible to fly. While you are at it, shut down Jesus, Martin Luther, Gandhi, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—and many others—who challenged their orthodoxies.
 
Just take a look at the posts at r/sgiwhistleblowers. The viciousness you see in their memes, for example, that displays a degree of wisdom that qualifies them to be experts in Buddhism? Calling MITA folks members of “a dog park”—that’s the height of their humanity which will lead to new dimensions of human progress?

And the delusion there! Do they really believe that 4100 people who hit a check-off box to receive their posts constitute a “membership” with all the rights and responsibilities thereof. Sure, 90% of the posts are by Secret-Entrance and Blanche sock puppets (it takes one to know one).

Daisaku Ikeda writes that in this treatise 

>The Daishonin, having risked his life to fight for kosen-rufu and subsequently triumphing over all obstacles and devilish functions, displays an indomitable spiritual state. Thus, he says there is nothing to fear, not even amid the most terrible persecution or hardship caused by devilish functions. 

So, there is “nothing to fear” when I meet with my Hockey Mom friends tomorrow. I’m sure I will not be the only one with dark secrets that want to be exposed to fresh air and sunlight.

The connection to the Longhouse bond issue? A bunch of moms who develop trust and friendship with each other mirrors the spirit of the Longhouse and what we are trying to develop as the basis of a new educational model.

You know, black holes are like the universe's ultimate mystery—no matter how many times we think we've understood them, they just reappear in new forms and fascinate us again. It’s as if they have a cosmic sense of humor, constantly pulling us back in for another round of wonder and curiosity.

And speaking of never-ending challenges, let’s talk about adulting—those official hobbies we all seemingly signed up for the moment we took our first breath. Paying bills, grocery shopping, figuring out taxes—sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry, right? Yet, somehow, we've all collectively agreed that these mundane tasks are just part of the grand adventure of growing up. 

Mastering the art of balancing a budget feels like running a marathon—long, exhausting, and filled with unexpected hurdles along the way. But hey, what makes it bearable are those well-deserved snack breaks: a chocolate bar here, a coffee break there, a quick scroll through social media to reset your brain. Sometimes, I think we've turned procrastination into an art form, seamlessly blending it with productivity.

Despite the chaos, there’s a strange camaraderie in all this—the shared understanding that no one truly has it all figured out, yet everyone keeps going. And honestly, that’s part of the fun! Life might be unpredictable and occasionally overwhelming, but it’s also pretty hilarious when you realize we're all just navigating this adulting maze together. So, embrace the chaos, celebrate the small wins, and remember: sometimes, the best way to deal with a black hole of responsibilities is to laugh at how absurd it all is.

I am really glad this subreddit exists as thanks to it I’ve found few people whom I can genuinely call friends now. 

Nevertheless, I can’t be in anything but a state of troubled spirit which follows infamous number of time wasting chats that have lead to NOTHING with people who are both making post and replying to posts with following titles ´ I am looking for friends’, ´would love to take a coffee with someone ´, ´ I want to meet somebody’ etc. 

I want to underline that MEETING PEOPLE is different to ARRANGING MEETING or CHATTING. 

Saying you are looking to meet somebody and then disappearing, or more often canceling the meeting on the same day is abominable behavior. I find it very misleading, disrespectful and nonsensical.

The only common overlap was that we are both single and dating with intention. After very politely stating that as a reason why we were probably not a match, she then goes on to say, ""Maybe we should still meet to see if there's a spark and a connection? It just takes that one moment. It's worth a shot...""

Ma'am, I literally just gave you the breakdown as to why our match wasn't going to go very far for much bigger reasons. No ""spark"" is going to change that, and further more, I must speak my truth that I don't believe ""sparks"" are a thing. Here's why:

\- I think what people confuse as being a spark is being drawn toward more extroverted personalities that make them feel like they're engaging with someone who makes them feel like something special is happening during their interaction. If they're seeking out a ""spark,"" they're more likely to be looking for something the person does or says during that first meetup that justifies their belief and thus, gives them reason to believe this must be \*the\* match that's different than others.

\- On the alternative side, a lot of people in this world are slow burn personalities. Maybe they're introverted or ambiverted, but they're not the kind of people you're going to get a full read on over a half hour - hour-long coffee dates. In these cases, the ""spark"" of their whole personality might not be seen until the 2nd, 3rd or maybe even 4th date. I can definitely think of various instances in my life where it wasn't until I got to know someone better and vice versa that I began to develop feelings for them that felt like they just crept out of nowhere because I had never thought about that person/each other that way upon first impression.

Of course, sometimes you match or meet someone and there's just no chemistry or bigger scale compatability, and that happens a lot, too. It wasn't for a lack of the person not having a spark that makes them dateable, though. It just meant -- much like my match example -- that you were not a complimentary fit to begin with and going out on that date ""to see if there's a spark"" was probably a not good use of anyone's time since it just confirmed the obvious that you were ignoring.",0,1752236582.0,Bumble,18,0.39,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.

Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden—maybe we could head home together.

After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.

Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.

The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.

The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order—all the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.

I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.

He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.

But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew—calm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.

As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.

I'd always considered this a strength.

Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.

That silhouette... was that Vera?

I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.

My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive—a breath of youthful energy.

But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.

Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.

Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""—to avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.

This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods—""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night—Aiden had had enough.

He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.

Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.

Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk—avoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.

So what was Vera doing here?

""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""

Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.

Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""

Complaints erupted immediately.

""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""

""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""

""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""

Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.

He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.

For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?

But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.

Chapter 2

My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.

The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.

An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning—but from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.

Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.

Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright—showing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.

She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.

As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.

Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.

He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.

Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients—after that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""

I said nothing.

The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.

Every minute of waiting felt endless.

The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume—Vera's fragrance from earlier.

I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.

I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.

When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water—I knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.

But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours—it could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""

Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""

And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?

Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance—wouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?

When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""

The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.

When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.

I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.

Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God—I'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""

She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""

Chapter 3

Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""

Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.

I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.

The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""

I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction—this ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.

I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.

Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.

The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute—in that moment, it made me nauseous.

Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""

Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""

My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?

Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.

Principles? Rules?

Apparently they only applied to me.

A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard—maybe sensing my emotional turmoil.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.

The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""

""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.

Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""

Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""

Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.

A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.

""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""

Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.

In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.

I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.

# Chapter 1 A Fateful Departure

The sun was setting on Rosalie Moreno's life with the Moreno family, and she had hoped for a silent farewell. But as she tiptoed towards the door, ready to vanish into the dusk, Jennifer Moreno, her adoptive mother, summoned her with a voice that cut through the quiet.

In the living room, Yuri Moreno, the family's true daughter, nestled close to Yosef Lennon, the Lennons' indulged scion, on the couch. A pang of realization struck Rosalie—her presence was surplus.

The Morenos and Lennons had a marriage pact, and Yosef, who'd boasted of claiming Rosalie as his bride since their school days, was now smitten with Yuri, who'd returned only a week ago. It wasn't Rosalie he desired; it was the Moreno name.

Jennifer wasted no time in confirming Rosalie's suspicions. ""Rosalie, can't you see? Yuri and Yosef are a match made in heaven. You and Yosef were never meant to be, but they... they're perfect together.""

""Love can't be forced; it's fate,"" Jennifer continued, her tone softening. ""Don't cling to Yosef out of habit. They'll be engaged before you know it.""

Rosalie raised a skeptical eyebrow. ""Tell that to Yosef. He's the one who can't let go. I've never been interested."" She had seen through Yosef's grand gestures long ago; he was nothing more than a plaything to her.

Yosef, who'd endured Rosalie's disdain for years, harbored a grudge. Seeing her still acting with an air of superiority, even after losing her Moreno status, he sneered, ""You're just a nobody, yet you talk so big.

""No wonder I never liked you. You're a fake! Thank God we weren't engaged. I'd be stuck with you and your replacement!""

Yosef sneered at Rosalie with a look of utter disdain, yet a tinge of regret lingered in his heart. Rosalie's beauty and figure were leagues beyond Yuri's, a fact that was hard to ignore. He thought it was such a shame that Rosalie wasn't the true-born daughter of the Moreno family.

Rosalie's retorted, ""That's what I'm saying! Thank God someone else is taking you off my hands, or I'd have to look at your pockmarked face forever.""

Yosef's face, scarred by acne, twisted in anger at Rosalie's jab.

Yuri, feigning concern at Yosef's mockery, played the peacemaker. ""Yosef, don't be so harsh. She might get hurt. After all, if I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have taken you or the Moreno heiress spot from her.

""She's just lashing out because she's hurting inside. Can't you cut her some slack?"" Yuri's voice dripped with false sympathy.

Rosalie wasn't buying it. ""I'm not upset. This loser chased me for years, and I never cared. But you? A week back and you're already with him. Trash and a schemer—made for each other!""

Jennifer exploded at that, ""You heartless girl! Why are you so rude? No wonder I could never get close to you; you're naturally disrespectful.

""You lived a life of luxury for eighteen years while Yuri suffered. And now you insult her? That's outrageous!""

Rosalie, reprimanded by Jennifer, remained unflustered. Everything she had with the Moreno family, she'd earned through her secret contributions to the family's business.

Curtis Moreno, Rosalie's adoptive father, had saved enough to start a factory but lacked the business acumen to keep it afloat.

Without Rosalie's secret help, the factory would have folded, and the Moreno family wouldn't have become one of Serenity District's top merchants. But Rosalie never bragged; they were clueless about her role as the factory's biggest backer.

Curtis, dragged into the downstairs fray, frowned on purpose, playing the peacemaker.

Curtis pretended to blame Jennifer. ""Come on, that's not how you talk to Rosalie. She's going back to her family today, facing tough times. Besides, we messed up eighteen years ago; it's not her fault. Can't let her leave broken-hearted, right?""

Curtis, though hypocritical, had a fair point. But looking at Rosalie, his feelings were mixed.

He loved Rosalie since she was a kid—charming and lovely. But if she hadn't been with them, they wouldn't have missed their real daughter for eighteen years, suffering away from home.

Curtis let out a sigh as he spoke to Rosalie. ""Rosalie, you're not my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. You're like my own kid.""

""I've done some checking. Your real folks are out of work. If you ever need something, don't hesitate to come back and ask for help,"" Curtis added, feigning kindness.

Jennifer, sitting close by, jumped up and nudged Curtis. ""Why are you being so generous? Watch out you don't end up with a freeloader! Parents without jobs—what kind of decent family is that?""

Rosalie looked at the Morenos' fake smiles and Yosef, her face blank as she said, ""No thanks, Mr. Moreno. But you might want to focus more on running the factory and the company, especially keep an eye on the people around you.""

Rosalie glanced at Jennifer, a hint of warning in her voice.

There was a real snake in the grass at the company. Jennifer and her brother had been siphoning off money for years. If Rosalie hadn't been watching them, they might have bled the company dry.

If her birth family was really struggling, Rosalie figured she wouldn't have time to deal with the Morenos' drama.

Jennifer exploded at her words, ""So you can't stand to see us doing well, can you? Even as you're leaving, you have to curse our business. Like you've ever managed the factory! What are you even bragging about?""

Rosalie knew arguing with Jennifer was a waste of time, so she just snorted, ""You'll see what I'm capable of soon enough.""

Not wanting to waste any more breath, Rosalie stood up, slung her only backpack over her shoulder, and headed for the door. Inside was just her ID and the laptop she'd bought herself. She wasn't taking anything else.

But Yosef had to get in his digs. ""Mr. and Mrs. Moreno, Rosalie didn't even bring her luggage. Who knows what valuables she's got in that bag. You'd better check it!""

Jennifer, taking the bait, immediately said, ""Yosef's right! Open it up and see what's inside!""

# Chapter 2 The Enigmatic Ride

Yuri feigned concern with a practiced sigh. ""Mother, is this truly necessary? Rosalie's family is in dire straits. Even if she took a trinket or two, it's but a drop in the ocean for us. Can't we show some compassion?""

Jennifer's eyes narrowed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Everything in her room was a gift from us. How dare she use our generosity to sustain her family? Her parents, jobless and adrift—will a few baubles truly make a difference?""

As she spoke, Jennifer advanced on Rosalie's backpack, intent on exposing her supposed thievery.

Rosalie, anticipating Jennifer's petty invasion, unzipped her bag with a flourish. ""Here, see for yourselves. No Moreno trinkets grace this bag. My ID is my own, and the laptop and clothes I wear were bought with the money I earned from my scholarship.""

If Rosalie hadn't been funneling her earnings to support her family, she would have flaunted her wealth in their faces. But they weren't worth the satisfaction.

Seeing the backpack's contents, Yuri and Yosef exchanged glances of disappointment. They hadn't expected Rosalie to have such integrity.

As the Morenos stood speechless, Rosalie slung her backpack over her shoulder, ready to make her exit.

Suddenly, a frail figure descended the stairs with urgency. ""Rosalie... wait for me...""

The Morenos whirled in shock to see Yancy Moreno, fresh from surgery, hastening down the stairs.

Jennifer rushed to support her son, her voice laced with panic. ""Yancy, you should be resting! Why have you left your bed?""

Yancy, battling severe aplastic anemia, had undergone a bone marrow transplant by a mysterious doctor. Though the surgery was successful, he was still fragile, needing to avoid stress and exertion. They had kept him from Rosalie, but he defied their wishes.

Rosalie's heart, usually encased in ice, wavered at the sight of Yancy, the one who had always been weak yet her staunch protector.

At that moment, Yancy glared at Jennifer, his voice sharp. ""If you hadn't confined me, I wouldn't have had to rush."" The butler, under orders, had barred his way, but Yancy had slipped past. Luckily, Rosalie was still within reach.

Without delay, Yancy produced a card and pressed it into Rosalie's hand. ""Rosalie, I've heard about your family's plight. I've set aside some savings over the years. Please, take this, should you find yourself in need.""

Holding the card, Rosalie felt a warmth in her chest. In a family of strangers, Yancy was the only one who truly cared. It made all her efforts—researching his illness, ensuring his surgery's success—worthwhile. Now, as she left, Yancy was her only concern.

Seeing Yancy's generosity, Jennifer's face pinched with anxiety. ""You foolish boy, that's your only card, with at least ten grand in it! Why give it to her? She's not even your real sister!""

Yuri, feigning innocence, couldn't help but worry. ""Wow, Yancy is so generous to Rosalie. I've been home for days, and he hasn't even spoken to me much.""

Yosef, sensing Yuri's slight, immediately defended her. ""Come on, man, that's just too biased! You're so cold to your own sister, yet you lavish attention on that impostor.""

""You!"" Yancy fumed, his anger palpable.

Seeing Yancy upset, Rosalie's eyes darkened. She snatched a glass of water and splashed it directly in Yosef's face.

""Hey! Rosalie! How dare you!"" Yosef, heir to the Lennon family, had never been so humiliated, and he shouted in rage.

But Rosalie's gaze was icy. ""Yosef, this is the Moreno residence. Who are you to yell at the head of the Moreno family? Yancy just had surgery and can't afford the stress. Watch your tongue!""

Yosef, used to leveraging his family's friendship with the Morenos, often lingered at their home. Initially to pester Rosalie, he had lately shamelessly attached himself to Yuri, growing presumptuous, even daring to disrespect Yancy. He truly overstepped.

Realizing his blunder and noting the displeasure on Curtis and Jennifer's faces, Yosef retreated.

Yuri seized the moment to stir trouble. ""Mother, Father, even if it's to defend Yancy, Rosalie's actions were outrageous. Splashing water on guests? That's beyond rude.""

Rosalie, unwilling to waste more breath on them, handed the card back to Yancy. ""Yancy, your health comes first. Use this for your supplements. Keep the money for yourself.""

""Rosalie..."" Yancy tried to resist, but Rosalie's grip was firm. He couldn't break free.

Rosalie smiled sincerely at Yancy, ""I appreciate the thought, but Yancy, don't worry about me. I don't need money. It's you who needs to take care of your health when I'm gone."" With that, she released his hand.

Yancy, still worried, tried to insist, but Rosalie was already walking away with a casual stride.

Yosef, grumbling to himself, ""Not short on money? Even now, still pretending to be rich. Rosalie, you really know how to play the part!"" He had harbored this complaint for years and finally let it slip.

Yet, Yosef felt a twinge of discomfort. Rosalie's parting gesture—splashing water on him—left him feeling frustrated and exposed.

Seeing Yosef drenched, Yuri quickly offered a handkerchief to dry him off.

Jennifer, spying the card back in Yancy's possession, quickly snatched it. ""Thank goodness she had the decency to refuse. Otherwise, it would have been a disaster.""

Outside, Rosalie noted the Moreno family's driver made no move to offer her a ride, so she decided to call an Uber. To her surprise, a sleek black sports car, its brand discreet yet its presence commanding, pulled up just then.

Though the car's logo was subtle, the engine's purr betrayed its exclusivity. Under the sunlight, the black paint gleamed with a brilliance that hinted at hidden luxury.

A glance at the tires and rims confirmed their high-end origins. This car was no ordinary vehicle; it was a custom creation by a wealthy individual, likely as valuable as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.

Rosalie assumed an important figure had arrived. But to her astonishment, the man who emerged was shabby, with dark circles under his eyes.

He appeared no more than a few years older than her, yet his unshaven face and disheveled appearance contrasted starkly with his bright, piercing eyes. Upon seeing Rosalie, his eyes widened in recognition. ""You must be Rosalie?""

# Chapter 3 The Yoder Arrival

The man who stepped out of the unmarked luxury sports car was none other than Rosalie's biological brother, Zaki Yoder. His eyes widened at the sight of Rosalie, and he exclaimed, ""You and Mom... you two could pass for sisters.""

The Yoder family had planned for someone to collect Rosalie today. Zaki, having just wrapped up a high-stakes case, was on his way home for a much-needed break and decided to make a detour to pick up his long-lost sister.

He had half-expected to have to ask the Morenos to point out Rosalie, but the moment he saw her, he knew without a doubt that she was his sister.

Rosalie raised an eyebrow, skepticism etched on her face. ""You're my brother?""

""Indeed, I'm Zaki, your third brother,"" Zaki replied, stepping forward with a grin.

Then, a realization struck him. Glancing down, he remembered he had been tailing a drug lord for days, without sleep or a change of clothes, and he had come straight here. Exhausted, he had forgotten to stop and grab a fancy suit to make a good impression.

""Sorry, I was in a rush and forgot to change,"" Zaki said, the tough commander feeling oddly self-conscious for the first time in front of Rosalie.

Rosalie was about to dismiss it as no big deal when Yuri interjected from behind her, ""Oh my, where'd this vagrant come from? Security, why are you letting just anyone in?""

The Moreno family's gatekeeper hurried over, explaining, ""Miss, this gentleman claimed he was here to see Rosalie, so I let him through.""

Yuri feigned surprise and turned to Rosalie. ""Oh... Rosalie, I had no idea he is your family. Please disregard my earlier comment.""

Rosalie gave Yuri the cold shoulder. ""If you're truly sorry, the best thing you can do is be quiet. No one wants to hear your incessant chatter."" With that, she walked past, opened Zaki's car door, and tossed her bag inside.

At that moment, Yosef arrived, seeking to settle a score. Seeing Zaki's beat-up car without a logo, he smirked. ""Never seen a car without a brand. Did you put this together yourself?""

Zaki leaned against the car, worn out, and replied, ""Yeah, it's custom."" They were a special forces team, and they all drove modified vehicles, especially this one, designed by his fifth brother, Kenneth Yoder.

Kenneth was still in school, but he was already a prodigy in weapon design for the Defense Department. His creations, once tweaked, were incredibly powerful and unmatched.

These cars could save a life in a tight spot. So, this car was worth more than any luxury car out there, and it hadn't come cheap.

But Yosef didn't understand and continued to mock Rosalie. ""I can't believe your family even has a car, but without a logo, who knows if it's stolen.""

Yuri chimed in, feigning concern, ""Rosalie, you should be careful. You could get entangled in some legal trouble!""

Rosalie had had enough of their nonsense, and now they were insulting her family. They had reached her limit.

Before Rosalie could speak, Zaki's face darkened. He strode over to them, his imposing figure over six feet tall as he towered over Yosef. Placing a heavy hand on Yosef's shoulder, Zaki said, ""Kid, you can't just run your mouth. Didn't anyone teach you that?""

After years of rigorous training and interrogating criminals, Zaki had earned the nickname ""Ice King."" His glare suggested Yosef might wet himself. Never had Yosef seen someone so intimidating. Yosef stammered, ""I-I-I was just guessing.""

Zaki snorted, ""Guessing? Sure, you can say what you want, but there's a price for every word. If your folks didn't teach you that, I can."" As he spoke, he squeezed Yosef's shoulder a bit harder.

In an instant, Yosef's shoulder popped out of its socket. He felt his arm go limp and screamed, ""Ouch! I won't do it again! Please, let me go!""

Zaki finally eased up, coldly putting Yosef's arm back in place.

Yosef was too terrified to utter a word.

Yuri, standing nearby, didn't fully grasp what had happened, but Yosef was pale as a ghost from the pain.

Zaki glanced at Yuri, causing her to shiver. His stare was absolutely terrifying.

""Young lady, I don't hit women. I'll let you slide today, but watch your mouth next time. I won't tolerate anyone cursing my family,"" Zaki said coldly.

Terrified, Yuri could only nod.

Zaki dialed back the intimidating aura and turned to Rosalie with a grin. ""Hey Rosalie, let's bounce.""

Rosalie gazed at Zaki's grin, seeing a totally different guy from the tough character he'd just played. She knew Zaki was definitely not someone to mess with.

Since he'd already shown Yosef and Yuri who was boss, Rosalie decided to play it cool. ""Alright, Zaki."" With that, she hopped into the car cheerfully.

Zaki, not thinking much of it, agreed, slid into the driver's seat, buckled up, and drove off from the Moreno residence. All that was left were Yuri and Yosef, staring in shock as the car vanished into the distance.

""Who is that guy really..."" Yosef muttered, feeling his arm had healed, but the fear from moments before still lingered in his heart.

Yuri shook her head. ""I don't know either, but the license plate seemed to be from Janivelle. And it looked like a police plate too."" It was puzzling; Zaki looked so scruffy, and yet he was driving a police car from Janivelle.

""You must have seen it wrong,"" Yosef shook his head. He had been too scared to notice those details, but he was sure she must have missed it.

Rosalie's original family was supposedly all out of work—there was no way that they could afford a car with Janivelle plates. After all, only locals could use Janivelle license plates.

Getting a residency permit in Janivelle was not something just anyone could do. Even with all the Moreno family's money, they still had out-of-town plates. They bet Rosalie's family must be really poor; there was no way they were locals from Janivelle.

# Chapter 4 Her Family Is Super Loaded

In the car, Zaki felt a bit awkward and said to Rosalie, ""Sorry, Rosalie, I was in such a rush I forgot to bring a change of clothes. I'm a bit messy, and now people are talking about you because of me.""

Zaki really didn't care about what he wore or used, but he couldn't afford to embarrass Rosalie.

Rosalie shook her head understandingly. ""It's fine, as long as the clothes are comfy.""

Zaki felt a bit warmer towards Rosalie. But when he noticed she only had one backpack, he couldn't help but ask, ""Rosalie, didn't you bring any luggage? Just this one bag?""

Rosalie nodded, her tone cool. ""I don't want anything from the Moreno family.""

Zaki, being good at reading people, noticed the displeasure in Rosalie's tone, and his gaze cooled a bit. He quickly said, ""It's alright. Once we're home, anything you need, I will buy for you.""

Rosalie gave a gentle smile. ""Okay."" No matter what her family's real situation was, at least Zaki genuinely cared for her.

Rosalie noticed the route Zaki was taking and couldn't help but ask, ""Zaki, isn't this road leading to Oceanside Manor?""

Oceanside Manor was home to the wealthiest and most influential people in Janivelle. The manor was huge, almost taking up the whole East District. As people went up the hill, they passed by groups of big mansions and a few fancy estates.

Even though the Moreno family moved to Janivelle not too long ago, they had already figured out their main goal was to get close to the ten ancient families of Janivelle, all gathered in the East District.

Unfortunately, the road leading to the hill was lined with checkpoints. Without an invitation from a property owner within the mansion district, entry to Oceanside Manor was not allowed.

However, their car paused briefly at a checkpoint, the license plate was identified, and they were immediately granted access.

Zaki casually replied, ""Yeah, Mom and Dad are waiting for you at home.""

Rosalie couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the fact—her house was actually in Oceanside Manor.

At this moment, Rosalie started to question Curtis's investigation. Curtis had said that her parents and brothers were all unemployed. If that was the case, there was no way that her family could live in Oceanside Manor.

Rosalie frowned, thinking, 'Curtis has always been unreliable in getting things done. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to manage the company behind the scenes. He probably assumed they were unemployed and jumped to conclusions.

'But that's fine. Since my family is quite well-off, I don't need to worry about supporting them anymore.'

As they drove past several small villas, she thought the car would stop, but it didn't. When she saw a large villa, she couldn't help but think, 'It seems like my family is richer than I thought.'

Yet Zaki's car continued for another ten minutes, exiting the villa area and heading straight into the manor district. Rosalie narrowed her eyes, thinking, 'It seems my new home is exceptionally wealthy!'

But just as she was settling into her thoughts, the car kept going. It eventually drove all the way to the top of the mountain.

Oceanside Manor was named so because the road at its peak had no barriers, and clear seas stretch out on both sides.

At the end of this road, there was just one mega mansion. This was also a landmark people can spot from downtown Janivelle, the Skyline Castle.

It was a landmark because Skyline Castle sat at the peak of Janivelle, and people can spot this castle-like building from way off in the city center.

This place was said to be personally managed by a world-class designer, making it a super luxurious and modern landmark.

Inside this grand castle, people can catch the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most beautiful sunset over the sea at night, which was why it was named after this stunning view.

The owner of this place was a mystery. It was rumored that even the ten most prestigious families in Janivelle couldn't touch them. Yet, no one really knew who owned Skyline Castle.

They say the owner was incredibly wealthy, with investments all over the place. But they didn't run a family business; instead, top managers and stewards handled everything.

So, this mansion's owner had never shown their face, and nobody knew the true identity of their family members.

Just when Rosalie thought Zaki was just showing her the view and would soon head to another villa area, Zaki surprised her by driving straight into this museum-like estate.

In the sunlight, the fountain at the center of the estate splashed water in all directions, reflecting bright rays. The sculpture in the middle was actually a masterpiece by a famous modern artist, clearly worth a fortune.

Even Rosalie, who was used to appraising valuable artifacts, thought the sculpture was truly exceptional.

At this moment, Zaki's car slowly stopped at the front entrance of the castle. Before Rosalie could gather her thoughts, Zaki got out and, with a gentlemanly flair, opened her door. ""Welcome home, Rosalie.""

As soon as he finished speaking, over twenty servants lined up on both sides of the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison and said, ""Welcome home!""

For a moment, Rosalie felt like she had stepped onto a movie set.

""Zaki... Is this... my house? Really?"" Even though Rosalie wasn't short on money and had seen plenty of influential people, she was still a bit shocked.

After all, she was prepared for her family to be broke, with her parents and siblings all jobless, relying on her to support them. She never expected a complete turnaround. Her family turned out to be the legendary top-tier mysterious billionaires of Janivelle.

# Chapter 5 Back Home

Zaki looked at Rosalie's somewhat surprised expression and smiled warmly, ""Yes, this is your home. Go on in, Mom and Dad are waiting for you.""

Rosalie composed herself and got out of the car, glancing at the extravagant red carpet beneath her feet, feeling a bit awkward as she walked up. ""Isn't this a bit too much?""

Zaki smiled, ""It's important."" After all, Rosalie had been through so many hardships over the years. Her first time home should be celebrated.

While they were speaking, two figures dashed out from the grand doors at the end of the red carpet. ""Is that Rosalie?!"" A voice filled with excitement and melody called out.

Rosalie looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple dress, yet she was elegant and ladylike. Although she was over forty, she maintained herself very well, resembling a famous actress, gentle and charming.

Beside the woman was a charismatic middle-aged man, standing tall and handsome, looking very much like Zaki. Rosalie could immediately tell that this couple must be her parents.

They were looking like a wealthy couple, having nothing related to the broke couple Curtis had mentioned.

At this moment, Roxanne Yoder had already reached Rosalie, grabbing her hand with tears in her eyes. ""That's it... this is truly my daughter. Zachary, look at how much she looks like me, right?""

Zachary Yoder was equally surprised as he looked at Rosalie and Roxanne's strikingly similar faces and agreed, ""Yeah, she really looks a lot like you.""

Roxanne was once an internationally renowned superstar, known for her stunning and unique beauty.

Initially, no one suspected their daughter Xyliana Yoder had been switched at birth. But when puberty hit, and Xyliana started to look less like Roxanne and Zachary, people began to whisper, and they felt something was wrong.

They didn't expect that shortly into their investigation, the Moreno family would discover the mistaken swap, and the police confirmed it with DNA tests between them and Rosalie, finally confirming Rosalie was indeed their biological daughter.

Initially, they planned to conduct a DNA test after Rosalie returned home, but now it seemed unnecessary. Rosalie looked exactly like a younger version of Roxanne, without any makeup, yet she exuded breathtaking beauty and pure charm.

Rosalie couldn't believe how much she looked like her mother either.

Jennifer had always kept Rosalie at arm's length because she was cute and pretty from a young age, and as she grew, she became stunningly beautiful.

Jennifer even wondered if Rosalie was really her own daughter. Driven by these doubts, Jennifer started investigating, and to her surprise, her suspicions were confirmed.

Rosalie felt that she truly found her biological parents.

""Dad, Mom, the wind is strong outside, let's go inside and talk."" Being at a seaside mansion, the sea breeze was indeed strong. Zaki gently reminded Roxanne, worried she might catch a cold.

Roxanne nodded excitedly. ""Yes, yes, I was so excited I forgot! Let's go in,"" she said, grabbing Rosalie's hand as they walked inside.

Rosalie felt Roxanne's soft and warm hand, and a wave of warmth spread through her heart. Having been resented by Jennifer since childhood, Rosalie rarely experienced a mother's care and love. Now she could finally feel just how comforting her mother's warmth was.

They walked in together. First, they went through the foyer. Even though it was just a small entrance hall, it felt like an art gallery, with walls covered in paintings, and in front of them, various pottery and sculptural artworks were displayed.

As Rosalie passed by one of the pottery pieces, she paused for a moment. She pondered, 'This piece of art looks so familiar.'

Noticing Rosalie's gaze, Roxanne quickly asked, ""Rosalie, do you like this artwork?""

Rosalie paused for a moment, feeling awkward, and just nodded. She replied in her heart, 'Of course, I like it. I made it.'

However, with so many artworks she finished each month, she usually just packed them up and had her assistant take them to her art studio to sell.

This particular piece only took her three hours at most to finish. She never thought it would end up at her parents' house.

Roxanne said, ""If you like it, feel free to put it in your room. It's the masterpiece of a mysterious new artist. I bought it a month ago at a charity auction for 3 million dollars. It wasn't expensive, but it's quite creative.""

Hearing this, Rosalie's lips twitched, thinking, '3 million dollars, and it is not expensive?'

Although the Moreno family was among the top three wealthy families in Serenity District, they couldn't just easily spend 3 million dollars on such a small piece of art. And it was something Rosalie created on a whim. She couldn't help but guess how rich her family was.

They all moved to the main hall, where several servants were lined up on either side.

Ten of them were holding trays with various drinks. Even the coffee had several types, while another group carried assorted snacks.

Roxanne walked by with Rosalie and said softly, ""Since it's your first time home, I didn't know what you like to drink, so we made all sorts of coffee. We've also got a variety of juices. Just choose what you like.

""And over here are the pastries from Janivelle's best bakeries. I got one of each flavor for you to taste, so feel free to try them.""

Seeing Roxanne's eager eyes, Rosalie had to choose a cup of freshly ground coffee and two pastries. ""I don't like it too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors are just perfect.""

Roxanne was immediately overjoyed. ""I never would have guessed that our tastes are so similar.""

The selected servant brought the pastries, while the others left.

Zaki then said, ""Mom, Dad, I'm going to change my clothes.""

Zachary looked at Zaki's messy appearance and sighed, ""You're now the leader of Special Unit A of Interpol! What kind of case would make you personally lead a team to such an extent? If I'd known you looked like this, I wouldn't have sent you to pick up Rosalie. What if you scared her?""

Zaki felt embarrassed. ""We were capturing an international drug lord this time. It wasn't just me; even the deputy chief personally led the operation.""",2,1752236278.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,4,1.0,False

The doctor didn’t disclose what they thought it was and we’re awaiting biopsy results. I saw the image and after a quick google search it appears to my untrained eye to be barettes esophagus. Not bad, not great. We will wait for the biopsy results before we celebrate. 

Background. My husband has suffered from heart burn since his teens, almost everyone in his family has it. He drinks alcohol regularly. Drinks at least two cups of coffee a day plus pre workout. A few months ago after a night of heavy drinking at a get together he started vomiting blood plus severe stomach pains. He’s been suffering from stomach pains the past few months also. 3 years ago his grandfather passed away from esophageal cancer. It was a terrible, painful death.

My husband read that barettes esophagus only has a 5% chance of turning into cancer. So he thinks he doesn’t need to change his lifestyle because he thinks it’s low. He’s acting childish. Last night before bed he literally cracked open a beer, his voice was still horse from the scope/biopsy. He will not listen to reason. I’m writing this as he left to go get his first coffee of the day and refused to at least eat something first. 

Once we get the results and know for sure what we’re looking at I want to tell him mother, to get back up, if he doesn’t change his tune. It was her father that passed from esophageal cancer. WIBTA?

Edit to add: he’s been taking high doses of pantoprazole for many years already to treat his heartburn. ",46,1752236191.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,68,0.9,False

Men's Sheds tackle social isolation and provide a safe and friendly environment to get together with others, learn new skills and make things or repair things brought into the Shed by members of the community. They often help local projects by making things that are needed such as planters for a gardening project or benches for local parks. It's not all woodwork though and our Men's Shed is directed by its members.

There's definitely lots of attraction here, physically, emotionally and mentally.

Says she didn't see my DM on insta, but even when I text her phone asking if she'd grab a coffee with me during lunchtime, nothing. 

I'm just trying to understand what might be happening here. I will ask her about it next time i see her.

Just some extra info, we're NOT work colleagues or anything like that. 
She's 24, I'm 31. I've never been into younger girls during my early-mid 20s because they felt too childish for dating, although i had lots of close friends. But now, they have grown up into beautiful young women and some of them are pretty mature but fun and youthful.
