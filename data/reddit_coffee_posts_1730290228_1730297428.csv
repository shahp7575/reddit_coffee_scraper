1gfndcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gfndcj/after_the_days_together/,after the days together,"Since I returned home, I no longer really recognize the life I lead there. Everything seems foreign to me, almost hostile. There is this void that nothing and no one can fill, a lack so deep that it sucks me in and leaves me powerless. I never imagined that an absence could weigh so much, be so present. And yet, every day, every hour, it is you who inhabits my thoughts, like a ghost who refuses to leave me.

These days spent with you were like a break in my life, a beautiful escape where everything seemed so simple, so obvious. I felt like I had finally found what I was looking for without knowing it: a place, a person, an emotion that made me feel like I belonged. Being near you gave me this feeling of belonging, as if, for the first time in a long time, I was living fully, without restraint. But now I find myself here, surrounded by these familiar walls that seem hard and cold, as if to remind me that this sweetness, this love, was fleeting.

Every morning I wake up with this weight on my chest, a kind of dull pain that reminds me that you're not there. The silence is oppressive. Before, he didn't bother me, but now he reminds me of your absence every moment. I wake up, and my first instinct is to look for your face, to reach out as if you were going to be there, next to me. But there is only emptiness, an emptiness that I feel in my bones. This silence… it’s the worst. Every second without you is marked by this lack of noise, this lack of warmth, this lack of you.

I spend my days wandering through my own life, like a stranger in a place he knows by heart but where he no longer finds his place. I do things mechanically, without really being there. Every task, every detail, reminds me that you are far away, and it breaks me a little more each time. Even the simplest things, like drinking coffee in the morning, have become challenges. I find myself looking out the window, almost madly hoping that you will appear, as if, by some miracle, you could be there. But the street remains empty, like my heart, like my soul.

In the evening, it's even worse. Night falls, and with it, the solitude becomes even more oppressive. Everything around me is plunged into darkness, and I find myself alone with my thoughts, my regrets, my memories. I relive every moment spent with you, every smile, every laugh, every look exchanged. These memories are all I have left, and I cling to them desperately. But the more I relive them, the more they remind me of what I no longer have, of what I left behind. Sometimes I wonder if I could ever be happy without you. The very idea of ​​continuing my life without this sweetness, this light that you bring, seems unbearable to me.

There are nights when I lie awake, staring into space, wondering what you are doing, if you think of me as much as I think of you. I wish I could call you, talk to you, hear your voice to fill this silence that is slowly killing me. But I'm afraid... afraid of appearing weak, afraid of showing you to what extent this distance exhausts me, destroys me. So I stay there, in silence, hoping that, somewhere, you feel this lack as much as I do.

Since I came back, I haven't been myself. Everything that surrounded me, everything that was part of my life, no longer makes sense. The things that once comforted me or made me happy no longer bring me anything. I'm like a shadow of myself, a pale reflection of the person I was with you. When I think back to these moments spent together, it’s as if I touched something precious, something rare, but that I could no longer reach. These memories have become my refuge, but also my torment, because they remind me of this lost happiness.

I know that this pain will eventually subside, that time will gradually erase this suffering. But, at the same time, I don't want to forget. I don't want these moments to fade away, because they are all I have left of you. So I let myself be carried away by this sadness, by this loneliness that eats away at me, as if it were the only way to stay connected to you.

I don't know how long I can hold on like this, how many days I can endure this absence which is eating away at me. But one thing is certain: you left an indelible mark on me. And as long as I live with this lack, with this sadness, you will continue to exist in me, in one way or another. Because deep down, this pain is proof of the importance you have for me, of the love I feel. And even if it hurts, I would rather have this pain a thousand times than not feeling anything at all.

Your sweet enaeco

Ive been doing this work for a year or so since graduating and I just love it, left my last job bc it was actually just too slow and easy, and wanted more responsibility and frankly, a challenge. Since then Ive been offered two separate barista positions, but im having trouble deciding between them. Both are independent cafes, top notch specialty coffee places. The first is much closer to me, just under a 20 minute drive, the second is 50 on a bad day (but i hope to move closer to that location if I accepted it). The thing is the second place is a much more enticing opportunity, I would be getting in on the ground floor (it hasnt opened yet) and is being run by some very cool people. I would have a hand in menu development, lead cuppings, and generally advance into that next level of the discipline. Its also in a city vs the first being in the burbs, which is more the atmosphere I think I want to be in.
Basically, two good options, but one that is further but offers more in the way of growth. If they were equidistant there wouldn’t be a question, but im worried the commute will really burn me out (but maybe i’d just get use to it)

I’d like to get off-the-beaten path a bit since I know Kyoto will be flooded with tourists.

I don’t even necessarily need to go into some of the main temples as I’ve already done temples like Kinkakuji on a previous trip. I was recently in Nikko and was overwhelmed by the number of tourists there were at spots like Toshogu Shrine. 

Crowds unfortunately just take away my enjoyment of the place, no matter how beautiful or historically significant the spot is.

And yes, I recognize that I’m a tourist too. I’m going to Kyoto as I have a couple of friends I’m travelling with who haven’t been there yet.

For a second, I wonder if I'm going insane. But insane people don't think that they are going insane, right? Everybody knows that. Is it natural to wonder if my existential dread is triggered by reliving a series of stupid mistakes I made when I first stepped into independence and adulthood? Or is it from repeating these same mistakes knowingly and willingly? It makes me wonder if I’m some sort of emotional masochist.

The inability to change myself, combined with anxiety and self-awareness, is a sinister mix and the root of my dread. Sometimes, I wonder if it’s easier to live in denial rather than be self-aware. It’s time to embrace my feelings instead of bottling them up and projecting a tough exterior. Maybe that’s the only way I can break out of this vicious cycle of fear and loathing.

I’m at that phase in life where all my friends have moved on or settled down with family and kids. Being single and pushing 30 is not an ideal place to meet new people or make new friends. I hope to find something real—could be a friend, could be something more. A deeper connection and meaningful conversation. Is that too much to ask for? I really hope not.

I’m on a fitness journey, low-key taking the winter arc seriously, and trying to bring some much-needed discipline into my life. Eating healthy, getting proper sleep, and consistently working out and hitting my goals for the past two months have been keeping me sane.

I absolutely love banter of all kinds, as long as no feelings are hurt. TV shows, music, and football are my escape from reality. I’m a decent cook and would love to share healthy recipes.

In any case I revised it a bit, so it's more friendly to read, but still critical of the season.**

**Oh you thought season 6 was safe from me did you? Well you thought wrong.**

""The Dragon Prince"" has made a name for itself in the realm of animated storytelling, captivating audiences with its rich world and complex characters, while also having the tendency to drop the ball several times, seemingly out of nowhere, to push the plot forward.

This show is truly in a category of it's own, standing tall, looking down at us mortals, and pointing their fingers at us while laughing at our futile attempts to understand it's questionable brilliance. The critics gave this show very fair and unbiased reviews, which is precisely why they gave every single season a 10/10. Even season 4. Nope, nothing suspicious about that. All perfectly understandable as far as I'm concerned.

But fear not my friends, as I'm not a mere helpless mortal constrained by the limitations of the human body and mind. So grab your seats, your magical pens, and some popcorn, because I'm going all in on this one.

**Overview**

Now I've watched all of season 6, and it was a hell of a lot more enjoyable than season 4 and 5. However, Season 6 reveals several writing flaws that undermine its potential, despite showing improvements over the previous seasons. From uneven pacing, to repetitive character arcs, this season highlights the challenges the writers face as they try weave their narrative towards the inevitable finale.

It's no secret this show has had a lot of scrutiny because of it's themes, how it's handled them, the character's motivations, how they've handled certain characters, the bait and switching, amongst many other things. Which is precisely why they made the genius decision to not have any side stories related to season 6 to try and address these problems. Were you upset that a character did something completely out of nowhere, with no build up whatsoever? Well you'll be happy to know that you won't be getting any answers, or backstory to provide you some context.

But the thing that everyone was really looking forward to was a show were characters make incredibly nonsensical decisions...which leads to predictable results...multiple times...because it's convenient to the plot.

So here we have season 6 of the The Dragon Prince, brought to you by Netflix, the same guys responsible for causing the writers to give us that rushed ending in season 3, because they hadn't greenlight the other four seasons, and the masterpiece that was season 4, a season so great that it was the most negative rated season of them all. With a team like behind the reigns, how could season 6 possible have any flaws at all? All that spirit, excitement and optimism, definitely carried over from season 5. A season that definitely didn't bait and switch the audience with a character that had less than 5 minutes of screentime, who only showed up in one episode, which was her debut episode, and most certainly definitely didn't get heavily criticized because a certain someone endangered a handful of lives for a couple of tadpoles.

But anyway, lets get started with the review, and it goes without saying I'm going to be spoiling season 6, so if you haven't watched it yet, which at this point I'd be very surprised if you didn't, I'd highly advise you to leave asap, watch it all, then come back here. Or...you know just keep reading.

I originally intended to post this right after watching season 6, but ultimately decided to do it at a later time, after season 6 was watched by more people, and the events that had transpired had more time to settle in. I'm also writing all this taking into account some of the details revealed about season 7 and the beyond.

**Ezran’s Stagnation: A ""King"" Stripped of Growth**

So I'm just going to start with this, as I'm sure many people were expecting to see what my thoughts were on this character this season. I've been literally asked in my messages, what my thoughts were on his character this season and my thoughts on season 6 overall. 

So, has this season fixed Ezran? Did they write him better? Did they fix many of the problems that people criticised about how his character was written? Well...no...no not really. For the most part, he's pretty much the same, and if people really consider Ezran showing Viren no mercy or leniency as shocking, and fresh, then I don't know what to tell you. We've seen Ezran have emotional outbursts, and act cold towards individuals in season 2 and 3 when he feels he's been slighted or his opinions challenged. So seeing him act cold towards Viren isn't really all that surprising. This isn't a ""different side"" to him, this is par for the course him acting like he's acted before. There is a character however who we saw a different side to, and I'll be taking about them later, because they're the best parts of the show.

One of the most glaring issues in Season 6 is the portrayal of Ezran still remains largely the same as he's always been. Despite his position as king, he continues to re-enact the same naïve mistakes without showing significant growth or learning from past experiences, despite the show trying to present that he has. This thematic repetition is exemplified when he becomes a victim of kidnapping by Karim, because he decided to try and use his signature talk-no-jutsu on him, despite literally everyone telling him how much of a bad idea that was. Of course, let's not forget the disastrous consequences for his decision to retain the magical prison within his kingdom, knowing full well there were people after it, and the negative effect it was having on Callum.

The narrative for the most part shows that Ezran's sense of innocence remains unchallenged. Well until the end of the season where he literally loses his kingdom, but until then, he's pretty much just leaving me feeling frustrated as I watch him falter yet again due to decisions rooted in his naive idealism. The creators seemingly missed the opportunity to evolve his character into a more nuanced leader who grapples with the weight of his responsibilities. If you're a king of a kingdom, you can't recklessly endanger yourself or your people. If you're aware of a threat, don't dismiss it. If someone with years of experience tells you something is an incredibly bad idea, DON'T DO IT. But just like the previous seasons, when all is said and done, no one reprehends him for his for actions, not that I had any confidence that the show was going to do that. Plus it didn't really matter anyway, because not only did no harm befall Ezran, after the whole sunfire fiasco, he pretty much got over everything that happened pretty quickly. May I remind you that Karim's army pretty much got mowed down. Can't say the same about Ezran's kingdom though, heheheHAHAHA.

Moreover, the favouritism towards him, in regards to how his allies of perceive him, and witnessing how it backtracks the show’s potential is disheartening. Inappropriately elevating Ezran’s status or importance to the grand narrative again, because of course we need to make him relevant, with characters like Zubeia refer to him as Zym’s brother, he needs Zym, they're really important, just made me groan. I felt nothing. Like, are they seriously going to neglect and dismiss the other character's significant contributions to Zym’s upbringing and rescue. Why is Zubeia only acknowledging him? This selective acknowledgment not only undermines Callum and Rayla's contributions, but also trivializes the complexity of the relationships within the ensemble that should have been established.

Everyone should have had some kind of close bond with Zym. What's funny is that within that same episode, they were like, Zym has Soren, someone who has a big heart, and then do absolutely nothing with that. Like why did they even bring that up? If they're not even going to try and establish some kind of relationship between them? What's funny is that Soren has actually interacted with Zubeia, and it was very well received. People really liked it. It felt very believable. Organic. Intriguing. They wanted to see more of that. Glad to see they did absolutely nothing with that.

The issue extends beyond Ezran’s singular experiences, bleeding into how other characters are portrayed throughout the season. For instance, the season attempts to show Ezran grappling with his attitude toward Viren, yet this evolution seems inconsistent. His struggle leads to a frustrating cognitive dissonance: while he holds a grudge against Viren, he is willing to extend forgiveness to Avizandum, you know the dragon that caused so much pain to his family and kingdom for years, and by extension Zubeia, you know the wife of the dragon who was perfectly fine with letting Avizandum do his thing until the humans retaliated and killed him. The rationalization behind his selective empathy raises questions about the principles he champions and further underscores the problematic writing choices that have characterized this season.

Ezran’s kingship's, and relevance in the story as a whole, is portrayed as more critical than it truly feels, lacking the earned respect from his peers and proven incapability's in making difficult decisions. All in all Ezran was pretty much a nothing burger this season, if anything it's like the show only showed him at several intervals to remind us that he still exists.

**The “King” Who Wouldn’t Learn**

Ezran is presented as the ambitious young king, yet despite his royal title, one can't help but question whether he actually learned anything from his previous escapades. It feels less like character growth and more like a rerun of a sitcom we’ve overstayed our welcome in. This season, we witness the naïve ruler taking a hard left into Troubleburg when he decides to keep the magical prison—yes, the one that is practically a beacon for evil-doers—right in the heart of his kingdom. Did he think that maybe one of his enemies wouldn’t take a little field trip to check it out? “Oh, look! A mystical prison! What’s the worst that could happen?” Spoiler: Everything.

And it’s not just the magical prison! How about the kidnapping by Karim? Talk about a plot twist we saw coming from a mile away. Poor Ezran could’ve been wearing a shirt that said, ""Kidnap Me!"" and it would’ve been just as effective. It’s like the writers thought, “Let’s let him repeat his mistakes one more time; the audience will love it!”

**Zym: A Character Reduced to a Plot Device**

Ezran's bond with Zym, while initially heart-warming, when it wasn't something that they made just exclusive to the two of them, has devolved into a forced dynamic that drains Zym of his potential as an independent character. Where Zym could have been explored as a unique individual, he is relegated to a supporting role solely to maintain Ezran's relevance. The writers missed a prime opportunity to pair Zym with each of the main cast whose journey could have interwoven in a way that deepened the narrative. The interplay of human-dragon relations, particularly against the backdrop of Callum’s journey of self-discovery, could have yielded a world of thematic exploration, rather than resorting to simplistic storytelling that diminishes Zym’s character to that of a mere plot device.

Now, let’s address the mind-melding phenomenon. At what point did it become acceptable to let a last-minute plot device waltz casually into the scene like a surprise guest at a party? This entire concept felt thrown together, likely on a napkin during the writers’ lunch break. It’s like they looked around and said, “Hmmm, how to keep Ezran relevant…ah! Let’s (conveniently) allow him to communicate with Zym on a whole new level!” Because, you know, no one wanted to see Zym develop into a fully realized character with agency.

And what of Ezran’s supposed moral growth? Let’s remember the bit where he opts not to forgive Viren while still fawning over Avizandum, the dragon whose past actions resulted in some rather fatal outcomes for Ezran’s mother. How do we reconcile that? “Equality—only when it’s convenient!” It’s like trying to eat soup with a fork; it just doesn’t work, and it leaves everyone frustrated and confused.

Sure, Zym hatched in the first few seasons and produced some cute moments, but instead of allowing him to grow and explore his own story, the show treats him like a plot device tethered to Ezran's narrative. As if existing in the world of Xadia isn’t enough for him, Zym is effectively overwhelmed, trapped in the role of Ezran’s emotional support dragon. Spoiler alert: that’s not a job title that sets any creative sparks flying.

**Pacing Problems: The Tortoise and the Hare... in Slow Motion**

My fellow Dragon enthusiasts, if there’s anything worse than being served a lukewarm cup of coffee, it’s a season that drags its feet like a tortoise in a marathon. Season 6 showcases pacing issues like they're going out of style. There are points where scenes feel like they’re stretching their legs for a snack break. “Hey, let’s bask in the beauty of this landscape for an extra five minutes!” Meanwhile, the story is as compelling as a three-hour PowerPoint presentation. The pacing problems compound the writing flaws. When the show finally starts to build momentum, it often slams on the brakes for moments that could have been succinctly handled with a brief nod and a quick quip.

**Did We Want Romance or Speed Dating?**

The awkward escalation of Rayla and Callum's relationship left a trail of confusion. One minute they’re battling monsters and trying to save the world, next their broken up, then their keeping their distance, and the next they’re suddenly declaring their undying love while the audience is left saying, “Wait, what happened?” It seems the writers decided to hit the fast forward button without asking if the viewers had their popcorn in hand. The moments that should have turned into poignant reflections on their individual journeys instead turned into a whirlwind of “I love you’s” that felt more like a rushed promise than a meaningful declaration.

Imagine telling your best friend about this season only to express your utter disbelief: “So there I was, watching as these two basically went from ‘Hey, wanna camp out for survival?’ to ‘Let’s plan our fairy tale wedding!’ in record time!” Where’s the tension that builds a solid relationship? Where’s the witty banter, the moments of hesitation that actually makes sense, the delightful awkwardness that's believable and not forced? Instead, we received a series of conversations that revolved around feelings without much substance.

**Characters First, Romance Second**

In the grand tapestry of storytelling, character development is king (or queen, or dragon – let’s not be exclusive). Rayla and Callum both started this epic journey as fully realized characters, but their intricate journeys became increasingly defined by their romance. Rayla, once the embodiment of fierce independence, started to dissolve into a puddle of emotion over a relationship that felt like it was tacked on rather than earned, as if someone yelling “happy ending” in the script meeting meant they had to rush through it all.

Meanwhile, Callum’s inner battles—his insecurities, aspirations, and magical mishaps—that should have been given their fair share of screen time were overshadowed by his relationship with Rayla. What were once rich, engaging plotlines turned into a sort of theatrical pantomime of their love life. Imagine asking Callum about his magical journey, only to receive a thoughtful pause while he fumbles for words about how Rayla makes him feel. Sigh. I mean, come on! Can’t we have a little grown-up discussion here without it spiralling into love songs?

**The Multi-layered Complexity We All Crave**

It's almost like the writers took the notion that “romance sells” too literally. And through the haze of romance plots, Rayla and Callum lost their agency and complexity. Their individual stories felt side-lined, like extra toppings that didn’t quite make the final cut on a pizza. Instead of savouring the deliciousness of finely layered character development, we were served a flatbread with a smattering of “Rayllum” sprinkles and a hint of missing potential.

Let’s not kid ourselves; both characters have the capacity for significant growth—just imagine Callum truly wrestling with his identity! Instead, we are left with a situation where their internal struggles have been hijacked by overly sweet cinematic moments. If the writers had taken a bit more time to develop the interpersonal dynamics organically, we’d have found ourselves charmed, rather than scratching our heads in confusion.

**Soren: The Shining Beacon of Writing**

Let’s give credit where it’s due! In a season littered with clumsy character arcs and hastily scribbled dialogue, Soren stands out like a bright, blazing bonfire at a particularly well-lit festival. His journey towards understanding his complex feelings for his father, Viren, was well-earned. There’s something almost poetic about a guy who, for once, isn’t just continuously cast as the comic relief in a circus of angst.

However, while Soren’s relationship with Viren is written well—a relatable father-son tether woven with feelings of betrayal, alienation, and a fair amount of existential dread—other potential relationships fall hilariously flat. Soren could have had an intriguing bond with Zym, the opportunity was just sitting there (because who wouldn’t want a dragon as a best buddy?). And Zubeia? C’mon, writers, don’t pretend she’s not sitting there waiting for her shot at some meaningful dialogue.

Instead, Soren's friendships are treated like paper bags in the wind—floating aimlessly with no aim or substantial grounding. One can’t help but wonder if the writing team has a secret vendetta against meaningful connections, opting instead to let Soren’s excellent character traits fester in isolation. “Hey, don’t worry about that budding friendship you could have had with ( insert dragon character ). Let’s just throw in some more angst!” Sounds about right.

**Viren: The Zombie Character**

Now let’s specifically zero in on Viren’s character arc because he deserves his own soapbox—and not the kind you shout from, but the one you use as a bouncy castle. Season 6 attempts to re-cast him in a light of grim acceptance and questionable benevolence. It’s clear the writers wanted to give him a grand send-off, but they might as well have draped a cape over him and had him dramatically swoop out the door kicking and screaming. Wouldn’t it have been more poetic to see him come to terms with his failures last season and die there, so the emotional impact of  his death would be felt this season? Did we really need to watch him step into the fiery abyss and embrace those wrongdoings, which we know he's already acknowledged like a true tragic hero? It’s as though they said, “Actually, let’s hit pause on that narrative arc, just for a bit of bang and flash!”

What do we get instead? A series of awkward goodbyes and emotional reckonings that feel tacked on, like sprinkles on a bland cupcake. The effect lacks that satisfying “You’ve earned your fate!” payoff that we were all waiting for, in a way that actually felt earned. Now, instead of a nice crescendo of character growth, we get a cacophony of ‘meh.’

Last season, we experienced a cathartic crescendo. Viren appeared to have reached the end of his deeply complicated journey—a dude grappling with what he has done before. I mean, come on, the man literally ruined many lives, including but not limited to his daughter, his son, the princes, a good portion of Xadia, and a large number of other victims. Instead of giving him a poignant exit, where he could confront his past and embrace the tragic narrative—he is suddenly resurrected for the sheer purpose of having a dramatic send-off in Season 6, which in all honesty wasn't really needed.

This return felt forced, like his character development was trapped in a dragon’s lair and forgotten. It would have been more meaningful for him to stay gone in the previous season, allowing his prior actions to have weight and consequences. Instead, we got a rushed redemption that couldn’t even garner a sympathetic glance from me.

**When Supposedly Smart Characters Do SillyThings**

Let’s kick this off section with a bang—our beloved Rayla. Oh, Rayla! The Moonshadow elf who, despite having all the charm and charisma one could muster seems to have forgotten all about the myriad ways that Aaravos has proven to be manipulative.

In a truly eyebrow-raising decision, Rayla allows Callum to switch Aaravos's prison alone with a fake without blinking an eye. Seriously? This is the same Aaravos who has had a fantastic track record of weaselling his way into everyone’s psyche, effortlessly swaying minds while he’s literally imprisoned in a pearl. She literally witnessed him control Callum like a puppet. The last time I checked, “sleepwalking” towards the villain's prison spells a metric tone of trouble, but Rayla apparently decided that brushing it off as a bad dream was a better approach than, say, a genuine conversation about keeping Aaravos's prison far, far away from Callum. Or have someone watch Callum like a hawk. Or maybe have a powerful Archdragon keep Callum safe...oh wait sorry, I forgot, plot convenience prevented that from being an option.

Well, what happens next? Predictably, the prison stays where it was—just like my last attempt at finding where I left the remote and Aaravos ends up freed by Claudia, likely leading to all sorts of delightful chaos in season 7. Honestly, you have to appreciate the audacity. ""Hey, let’s not take this threat seriously while there are puns to be made and time to waste!” Great strategy, team.

**Ezran and the “Talk-no-Jutsu” Chronicles**

Now let’s shine a spotlight on Ezran ( again ), our young monarch who's got a heart as big as his dreams and a brain… well, let's say it's more of an aerodynamic shape since it tends to take flight, and is most of time empty. So, what does Ezran do? He decides that chatting up Karim, the villainous, racist, arrogant commander, might lead to a peaceful resolution, when it's so obviously a bad idea. Because when in doubt, why not take the diplomatic route? What’s the worst that could happen, right?

Spoiler alert: Karim takes Ezran hostage. There’s a moment where one can’t help but wonder whether the world’s finest diplomats are attending a lecture on how to be taken hostage effectively. This is a classic case of introducing the “talk-no-jutsu” trope, where the power of dialogue triumphs over swords—somehow failing to recognize that a sword to the gut, or bringing someone to their knees, typically trumps a heartfelt speech about feelings.

Naturally, as per the laws of plot conveniences, Ezran’s allies. on the Sunfire elf side at least, miraculously don’t suffer due to this grand moment of decision-making brilliance. Was it really to much to ask to have Sol Regem cause casualties for Sunfire elves and the citizens of Katolis? Apparently so. They couldn’t possibly be harmed, after all. Why? Because this is The Dragon Prince, where plot armour is thicker than a dragon’s hide and it seems like all these rules of storytelling apply directly to Ezran. Need a conflict resolved? Just have Ezran show up and everything will be peachy keen. I'm willing to bet if Ezran was there when Sol Regem attacked Katolis, some universal power would be at play to somehow turn things towards his favour.

https://preview.redd.it/2imcgsvcdwxd1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=586e01adf569f0114363db7fc5806adce1abcfae

**Viren’s Fathering Skills: A Masterclass in Bad Decision-Making**

Then we have Viren, whose parenting skills are, let’s just say, non-existent in this season. He’s just been resurrected and sees Claudia, his daughter, in a state that can only be labelled as “unstable at best, potentially terrifying at worse.” So, what’s Viren’s big plan? To leave her alone while he faces the music of his crimes, instead of making sure she's mentally stable first.

Good call, my dude. Absolutely fantastic decision-making. It’s not like Claudia has shown any signs of emotional turmoil that could potentially lead to more chaos—or heaven forbid, the release of an ancient evil, that he knows is manipulating events behind the scenes. Nope! Instead, Viren’s exit leads to their final conversation, like a bad sitcom that gets cancelled before any character growth can ever happen.

As a result, Claudia, heartbroken and even more messed up than before after finding his dead body, decides to release Aaravos. Bravo, Viren! You’ve not just created a family drama; you’ve accidentally launched a villain’s best comeback tour. The emotional rollercoaster has delivered us right back to the very cycle that keeps the series spinning. If only he had taken a moment to hold her hand and say, “Hey, maybe staying together for a bit would be a good idea” But alas, common sense is in short supply.

Also I'm not sure how exactly the writers expected us to feel sympathy for a man who essentially mentally abused his own son, for things that were outside of his control. Soren was literally ostracized by Viren through no fault of his own. Sacrificing yourself for a kingdom's worth of people to save them from danger, doesn't suddenly redeem you, and absolve you for all the horrible things that you did in the past.

**The Morality of the Series**

First off, let's tackle the elephant in the room: the show's idea of morality. Honestly, can someone explain the logic behind Viren’s wife’s dramatic characterization? The writers seem to want us to see her as some tragic, misunderstood figure, when she was quite literally willing to let their son, Soren, kick the bucket. I mean, this is not a plot twist or a device for character development; it’s more like a kick to the face of common sense.

Here’s the crux of the matter: Soren was on the verge of meeting his maker, yet his mother was torn — not because of her love but over some magical mumbo-jumbo that demanded her tears so Viren could save him. Apparently, tears are worth more than a son’s life. Really? Are we to believe that the river of tears she’d have to shed was just too much to ask? But wait, she leaves him anyway because, heaven forbid, he uses dark magic! That's right: save your son using dark magic, and you’re the villain. Honestly, if anyone deserved a classic ""You're dead to me!"" from the afterlife, it's her.

**Dark Magic: The Convenient Plot Device**

Ah, dark magic: the show’s favourite dark horse! The script tries its hardest to convince us that dark magic is the epitome of evil, akin to stepping on a LEGO brick during a midnight excursion. But here's the twist: dark magic has been the unsung hero of humanity! Let’s ponder this conundrum, shall we?

It healed Soren’s paralysis as if it were a magical form of duct tape.

It's literally the only reason why Soren is even alive, and his grim reaper ticket ended up invalid.

It prevented mass famine, like that one friend who brings snacks to the party.

It allowed humans a fighting chance against Xadia’s prejudice, like the underdog rising to the occasion in a sports movie.

Confused yet? The sheer irony that the very power responsible for saving lives is painted as the villain is richer than a chocolate cake in a bakery. Dark magic has the potential for depth — think of the layers like an intricate lasagne, but this show just serves us the cardboard box it came in, leaving us bewildered as we try to process why dark magic is just “bad.”

It's troubling that we are still expected to view dark magic as a purely evil force when it has been the knight in shining armour for these bipedal struggles against the colourful elves and dragons—who, might I add, seem keen on letting humanity flounder in dire straits. The same show that highlights the horrors embedded in dark magic glosses over critical questions like: “Do the ends justify the means?” and “Are humans so barbaric for wanting to defend themselves?” Seriously, the dialogue plays like a broken record of morality set in black and white.

**The Mystery of Sol Regem: A Dragon Who's All Smoke and No Fire**

When Sol Regem was introduced way back in season 3, we thought we were in for an exciting new player with multitudes of character development, some fresh dynamics, and lots of dragonsplaining about the world of Xadia. Instead, we got a glorified backdrop, stretching into the walls of seasons 4 and 5 like that guest at a party who loiters around the snack table, hogging all the chips and failing to engage with anyone. He was, I declare, a nothing burger.

Mere moments before his predictably tragic end in season 6, the creators dropped a smorgasbord of lore that would make even a determined dietitian’s eyebrows shoot up. “Surprise! We have some fascinating facts about Sol Regem!” they proclaimed as if they were presenting a new dessert to a surprised birthday party. But really, what good is revealing these things when he has just seconds to live? You wouldn’t throw a 25-page biography at a birthday cake!

**Here’s a quick overview of the lore dump:**

Real Name: Sol Regem’s real name is Anak Arao. Thanks for the info, but what does that do for us now?

The Blind Rage Incident: He kills his mate and, plot twist! He didn’t even know it until Aarovos told him. Great insights into his character just seconds before he cashes in his chips.

The Jerky Dragon: We find out he has been a complete jerk to humans since his juvenile dragon days. Yep even when he was the Dragon Prince, he just decided that humans where inferior. Seriously, does that ever make a character charming?

Leola's Execution: He ratted out Aarovos’s daughter for teaching magic to humans—so he’s basically responsible for every tragedy that's transpired within the series, but just now, at death’s door, it becomes convoluted lore!

And then, there’s the ultimate kick in the tooth: he experiences a tragic end while accomplishing pretty much nothing. Aside from burning down Katolis, where he manages to ruffle some feathers without proving any real threat or securing any notable kill count, his grand finale isn’t even a bonfire roast. It’s a sad ‘choking-to-death-on-an-innocent-elf’ scenario mixed with a side of internal fire self-immolation. Talk about an embarrassing exit!

What good does it do the audience to find out that Sol Regem’s real name is Anak Arao and he was a prejudiced dragon who played a pivotal role in humanity's suffering—all five minutes before he turns into dragon ash? The writers certainly seemed to think we needed to know that this guy had a narrative of blind rage and non-existent self-discovery right before closing the book on him. It made me want to scream, ""Too little, too late!""

Was this the writers’ idea of a character farewell? It’s almost as if they thought, “Let’s cram in 15 episodes’ worth of backstory and character development into the last 30 seconds of his life.”

The lack of backstory in his life choices leaves more questions than answers.

https://preview.redd.it/ipprzecgdwxd1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f39c8c89e826398cea961cfadad3574296d2f14f

**Callum and Sol: A Missed Opportunity of Epic Proportions**

Speaking of missed opportunities, let’s talk about Callum. Here we have a brilliant character who embodies everything Sol Regem claims humans cannot be. It’s a classic case of a senior dragon getting schooled by the plucky young human, which could have been the hallmark of his entire arc! Imagine the rich dialogue, the philosophical debates, and possibly Sol Regem’s jaw dropping to the floor in disbelief as Callum continues to weave magic without the usual backstory baggage.

But instead, these interactions never happen. Instead of exploring this goldmine of character chemistry, we’re left with Sol Regem flying around like a glorified flaming balloon animal. Sol Regem's potential isn't just wasted; he represents a perfect smoothy of narrative disappointment—a kind of tragically comedic performance that would be better suited for a slapstick cartoon than this supposed epic tale of magic and adventure.

Perhaps instead of wasting time with uninspired plot threads, the writers could’ve shifted their focus to the dazzling possibility of these two characters clashing. The narrative could have been enrichingly complex, a veritable treasure trove of nuanced storytelling! But alas! We will never know what could have been because the writers opted for the Archdragon to just be jerk for the sake of being jerk instead of trying to develop unique character interactions.

**The Crime of Compassion: Aaravos's Daughter**

Let’s discuss the tragic backstory—a staple so generic in storytelling, you could find it in a bargain bin alongside knock-off superhero comics. Aaravos’s poor daughter, Leola, gets executed for the utterly heinous crime of showing humans kindness. Can we get a collective “huh?” here? What a world where empathy gets you killed faster than lightning spells.

Now, this is where the writers throw their logic out the window. The elves and dragons, in all their superiority, couldn’t handle the idea of a humans receiving a little compassion. They determined that giving magic to humans was, what, a “violation of cosmic order?” If cosmic order doesn’t allow for empathy, then it might as well be papering the walls of the writers’ room because it’s clearly just a plot device—one that didn’t survive the first draft of a screenwriting class.

**The Final Showdown: Will We Ever Get Closure?**

As we inch closer to what promises to be a spectacularly chaotic final season—which will likely resemble a last-minute school project thrown together at 2 a.m.—the question remains: How do the writers plan to wrap up this convoluted mess in just nine episodes?

Breaking the space-time continuum would be far easier than moving the convoluted plot threads into a satisfying resolution. Is there a chance they’ll opt for a last-minute revelation that will tie everything together? Or will we witness a culmination so bewildering that it would make even David Lynch raise an eyebrow?

Unless the writers plan to pull a rabbit out of the hat—or, in this case, a dragon out of the sky—they face the daunting challenge of providing some form of resolution that feels earned, which if I'm being entirely honest with you, is simply not possible. Should we brace for disappointment, or should we try to guess the fast passes and quick fixes that they'll use to try and finish this season?

To make matters worse, with the final season looming on the horizon, the pacing has nowhere to go but down the proverbial rabbit hole. You can almost hear the frantic typing of the writers, desperately cobbling together climactic resolutions in just a handful of episodes. How they plan to wrap the sprawling narrative in just nine episodes is beyond comprehension, but given their track record, we’ll probably see a fusion of poorly executed clichés, philosophical musing, and abrupt plot twists just to tie it all together.

**When Hope Meets Reality: What Does Season 7 Promise?**

Now that we’ve dissected season 6’s many writing flaws, let’s face the chat; what’s next? Future seasons? Ummm...no.

Let’s pull our heads out of the cloud of wishes and realize that when it comes to continuing this story, we’ve more than likely reached a potential dead end.

The cardinal rule of storytelling? Always write with an end in sight. You can’t wing it and then act surprised when the audience is left with more frayed plot threads than a cat with a yarn ball. There’s such a thing as beating a dead horse, and that horse is truly looking sorry if the creators are contemplating more seasons post-season 7.

To think that I’d get invested in their world again after the multitude of disappointments? They’ve had six seasons to make their case, and boy, did they squander that chance faster than a dragon can burn through timber. The characters stagnated, focused on the mundane instead of developing rich arcs, and left me twiddling my thumbs, eagerly awaiting resolution without any sincerity.

And what about the characters? How can they continue to develop, when they’ve already been boxed into clichés that project less character growth and more “But wait, the plot needs us to be this way!” Ground-breaking stuff. Perhaps they'll create another mess where the Archdragons continue to elevate Ezran’s status to seemingly ludicrous levels. Seriously, he might as well get a medal for being the ""Best Plot Device Ever.""

Could Callum and Rayla spiral further into the depths of relationship clichés while we wonder if they’ll ever find their own identities? Or maybe the humans would just keep “making it up” to the other factions without having any true consequences of their past actions. Ground-breaking storytelling right there!

**Misleading Expectations: Promotional Material Gone Wrong**

Speaking of promotional material, let's get real. The show has developed a curious knack for marketing that leaves viewers feeling more duped than a pawnbroker at a garage sale.

Remember all the buzz around Domina Profundis and her supposed importance to Season 5? I certainly do. The reality? She had less screen time than a character on a holiday special for a side dish (and let’s be honest, we all know the side dishes deserve just as much love). With a few minutes of Ezran doing all the talking, her presence fizzled out faster than you can say “misleading trailers.”

The marketing team must have been spending too much time munching on dragon fruit, because the promise presented is far more exciting than the delivered content. Season 6 pokes and prods at some storylines with bold, sweeping gestures but retreats into a cozy bubble of “status quo” whenever they inch too close to genuine change.

**Conclusion: The Order of the Disheartened**

In conclusion, while it would be easy to suggest continued seasons for The Dragon Prince, I must firmly state that more isn’t always merrier. Season 6 gave us glimpses of improvement but failed to escape the yawning void of pacing issues, reliance on tired tropes, and character stagnation.

If the storytellers could do the honourable thing and keep the narrative tight while addressing past mistakes, perhaps they wouldn’t have to worry about whether they’re beating a dead dragon—or whether the audience will finally roar back in approval. So let’s raise a cup of cocoa to what the show was and what it could be again. Until then, I guess I’ll be sharpening my critique sword and preparing for the next round!

She recently had a break up ( not judging but this happens every few months or so) and I have tried to be there for her over the phone and text and we had been texting most days and tried to schedule a few times and something always came up (mostly on my end) one day after I canceled our plans due to a surprise massage my fiancé organized for me bc of the stress I have been under, she messages me saying that she doesn’t want to make plans with me anymore and would rather be with friends that “show up” more and when I told her that I have been as present as I can and on top of that I have been planning a whole surprise “be my maid of honor” with personalized gifts that I had spent a lot of time one and she literally laughed and said that “obviously I would turn this whole thing on me because the whole world revolves around me and that she definitely wouldn’t be my maid of honor” she was extremely mean and I just felt at that second that my heart kind of broke. 

I was thinking back to our whole relationship and I am contemplating whether I was a bad friend or she was. Example being every time I would have a huge fight with my fiancée she would always tell me he wasn’t the one and we should break up. 

I’m just trying to figure out if I should blame myself and start working on this issue bc maybe it is just my fault or is she just not a good friend. 



This is long, sorry.

I don’t know how to make my life better. Am I having a midlife crisis?","How do you go on or find a way forward when it seems like everything your life is going or has gone wrong and you can’t seem to fix it no matter what you do?

I just turned 48 and am still grieving the loss of my dad last year and have never gotten over losing my mom 17 years ago - both passed from aggressive forms of cancer - and on top of that have had to deal with a verbally and emotionally abusive older sibling and another older sibling who is unsupportive and all but ignores me. I’ve had to go through the grieving process alone this past year and it has been really hard.

I do not have a husband or significant other who can be there for me. I have a handful of friends, but they are too busy to respond to calls/texts and are never available to do even the simplest things like getting coffee or going on a walk. I feel very much alone and ignored most of the time and, despite my best efforts at reaching out to friends or getting out there to meet new people (classes, groups, events, etc.), I still somehow end up on the sidelines. It seems making new friends in your 40s is all but impossible because everyone already has established friendships.

To top it off, I am having to leave behind my longtime family home where I lived with my dad until he passed and it is really hurting me. As if I haven’t experienced enough loss and grief already, I am now losing the one place where I still feel some small bit of peace and comfort. I purchased a new house under pressure - the abusive older sibling refuses to sell her share of the family home to me even though she does not want to live in it herself -  and I am now regretting it. I don’t want to be there at all and feel I spent too much money on it, too. I wish I had never bought it.

I also have been trying very hard to find a job since my dad passed and have had zero luck. I’ve applied everywhere I can think of, updated my resume, contacted staffing agencies, sought help from my state’s employment office, even put the word out to friends and former colleagues, but I can’t even land a volunteer position or a part-time minimum wage job, much less something based on my education and years of experience and on which I can support myself.

And, to be honest, after all of the stress and loss I have experienced, particularly the past few years, I don’t want to end up chained to a desk or in a job that doesn’t fulfill me and only leaves me drained and unhappy. I’m already drained and exhausted from the past few years of my dad’s illness, losing him and having to deal with the abusive behavior from my older sibling. 

At this point, I need a break, but I also feel pressured to find a way forward. I want to be happy again and find some sense of purpose and enjoyment in life, but nothing seems to be working and I don’t know what to do. I have been seeing a counselor and that has been somewhat helpful, but it is only once a week or every other week, so isn’t enough. 

What I wish more than anything is that I had a stronger support system and wasn’t so lonely.

Has anyone else ever found themselves in a similar situation in their 40s? How did you manage it or cope?",4,1730296616.0,AskWomenOver40,0,1.0,False

I’m just trying to make sense of what’s been happening to me. I know that I’m not myself anymore, and I don’t know how much longer I can resist.

I can feel it growing stronger, taking over more of my mind and body. I'm trapped in my own skin, unable to escape. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on. It is becoming more powerful, and I am feeling weaker.

I've decided that I need to talk to someone. My wife, Sarah, has been in France for the past few weeks on a business trip.

Her company is launching a new clothing brand, and she is there for the first runway shows. I hadn't told her anything about what was happening, but I knew I couldn't keep it from her any longer.

I called her, and she answered on the second ring. **""Hey, Will,""** she said, her voice warm and reassuring. **""How are you holding up?""**

**""Sarah, I need to talk to you about something,""** I said, my voice trembling. **""It's really important.""**

**""Sure, honey,""** she replied, her tone shifting to one of concern. **""What's going on?""**

I took a deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts. **""I think something is wrong with me. I've been... sleepwalking, and I don't remember anything. I wake up in strange places, and I've found marks on my body. A few nights ago, I woke up naked in the woods behind our house.""**

There was a long pause on the other end of the line. **""Will, that's terrifying. Are you sure you're okay? Have you seen a doctor?""**

**""I saw a doctor, and he prescribed me some medication, but it made it worse. I had a nightmare, or maybe a memory, of something in the woods. It was... it was like a shadow, but it had a face. And it took the whistle I found in the box.""**

**""Whistle? What box?""** Sarah asked, her voice growing more worried.

**""I found an old wooden box with strange carvings in the back of the closet. Inside was a whistle made of bone, or at least I think it was bone. It had carvings of woodland animals, but one of them was different. It was a deer standing on its hind legs. I felt uneasy when I touched it, but I kept it. Now, it's gone, and I think it's connected to what's happening to me.""**

Sarah was silent for a moment, and I could sense her confusion and fear. Finally, she said, **""Will, you need to come to the hospital. We can get you some help. I'm on my way home right now, and I'll be there as soon as I can.""**

**""Thank you, love,""** I replied, feeling a small sense of relief. **""I don't know what else to do.""**

After hanging up, I tried to keep myself busy, but my mind kept drifting back to the whistle and the shadow in the woods. I felt a constant presence, like something was watching me, waiting for me to slip up.

Later that evening, Sarah arrived home. She looked exhausted but determined. **""Will, we need to talk to someone who can help you understand what's happening. I did some research, and there are experts in sleep disorders who might be able to shed some light on this.""**

I nodded, feeling a mix of hope and dread. **""I don't know if I can keep this up much longer. It's like something is inside me, controlling my actions.""**

Sarah took my hand, her touch grounding me. **""We'll figure this out together. You're not alone in this.""**

The next day, we visited a sleep specialist.

Dr. Thompson listened intently to our story and suggested a sleep study. **""We need to monitor your brain activity and movements to understand what's happening during your sleep. It could be a form of parasomnia, but we need more data to be sure.""**

Dr. Thompson suggested that I might be experiencing sleep terrors. This explanation accounts for the ""dreams"" and unusual bruises I have during sleepwalking. However, I remain skeptical about this diagnosis.

That night, as I lay in bed, I felt the presence more strongly than ever. The shadows seemed to dance at the edges of my vision, and I could hear a faint, eerie whistling sound. I tried to focus on Sarah's steady breathing, but the fear was overwhelming.

Suddenly, I felt something cold brush against the sole of my foot. I gasped, darting my eyes to my feet, and there it was—the shadow, standing at the foot of the bed. Its eyes glowed with a malevolent light, and it reached out to me.

**""Will, wake up!""** Sarah's voice cut through the darkness, and I bolted upright, gasping for air. I looked around, disoriented. Sarah was sitting next to me, her eyes wide with concern. **""You were mumbling and shaking. Are you okay?""**

I nodded, though I wasn't sure. **""I thought I saw it again. The shadow. It was in the room with us.""**

Sarah hugged me tightly. **""We'll get through this. I promise.""**

The days that followed were a blur. I went through the motions of daily life, but the shadow never left me. I felt it in the walls, in the air, and in my own mind. The sleep study confirmed that I was experiencing complex parasomnia, but the experts were at a loss to explain the full extent of my symptoms.

One night, as I lay in bed, I felt a familiar presence. The shadow was back, and it was closer than ever. I could feel its breath on my neck, and I knew it was calling to me.

**""Will, don't listen to it,""** Sarah whispered, her voice trembling. **""You're stronger than this.""**

But I wasn't sure. The whistle's call echoed in my mind, and I felt an overwhelming urge to find it. I got out of bed, my movements mechanical, and I walked to the living room.

The box was still on the coffee table, and this time the whistle was inside.

I picked it up, feeling the cold, smooth surface. The carvings seemed to pulse with dark energy, and I knew what I had to do.

**""Will, no!""** Sarah cried out, but it was too late. I brought the whistle to my lips and blew.

The sound was deafening, a cacophony of screams that shook the house to its foundations. The shadows converged on me, and I felt them dragging me down, deeper and deeper into the darkness.

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, surrounded by concerned faces. Sarah was there, her eyes red from crying. **""Will, you're safe now. We found you in the woods, unconscious. You were mumbling and had a high fever.""**

I looked at her, my mind a jumbled mess. **""I remember the whistle. I remember the shadow. It's still here, Sarah. It's still inside me.""**

She took my hand, her voice steady. **""We're going to get through this. Together. We'll find a way to stop this.""**

Was everything last night another dream? Was Sarah even there? What the hell is wrong with me? I thought to myself, lying helplessly in that hospital bed.

But as I looked into Sarah's eyes, I began to cry. I am trapped.

Then, I started seeing all the symptoms that I hit (around 85-95% of listed: hump back, weight gain in belly and breasts--I'm a male--, round face, thin arms and legs, super easy bruising, petechiae, brittle bones--broke my pelvis and elbow from a simple fall--, thin skin, insomnia, etc.)

I hate to be the hyper-worrier, but it would explain so much that my doctor's have always been concerned about but couldn't figure out (namely, the bruising and skin and bone issues). The first I can meet an endo is early December, so I have a bit to wait and I'm wondering what to do in the meantime to eliminate worrying--which surely would only increase the issues. But I have been having this go on for about three or more years now with it worse recently. 

Is it also possible that it's not full-out Cushings now and just excess cortisol that I can manage back. I'm a ridiculous coffee drinker (read like average 6-7 cups a day) and like my share of wine, but otherwise eat rather healthy and below calories (which is why the not losing weight was always a bit weird, too).

I’m currently working at a family-run company, which should be stable, but it’s a circus with zero organization. The company’s been around for 95 years and used to be managed well by the father. But since his two kids took over, things have gone completely off the rails.

The brother (my boss) doesn’t do anything but pretend he’s working. He’s constantly glued to his phone or chatting with his latest “romantic interests.” He often claims he’s “handling things by phone” – which is a joke, because we all know he’s either gaming or messaging random people. He once called me at 9 pm on a Sunday, drunk, with “new ideas” for the company. It’s absurd.

The sister, who technically has more authority, is equally unmotivated. She dismisses any suggestions for improvement, claiming that one annual year-end review is all the team needs. I suggested bringing back regular coffee meetings, which their father used to keep morale up, and her brother said, “We’re too busy.”

And the worst part is their treatment of employees. We recently had a case where a technician got an electric shock from defective equipment and felt chest pain the next day. When he went to the doctor, my boss yelled at him for “wasting time at the doctor.” Even the new apprentices are treated poorly. When they mentioned their legal protections as apprentices, the sister responded with, “I don’t care.” She regularly ignores basic labor laws, pushing them to take on tasks and hours they’re not supposed to.

Several longtime colleagues want to leave, and morale is at rock bottom. We have no real direction or leadership, and the rest of the team is exhausted. I’ve tried everything – proposing changes, directly confronting my boss, you name it. And I’ll be out for three months soon to finish my degree, which feels like a huge relief. But it’s frustrating to know I’ll be coming back to the same chaos unless something changes.

I’m holding on because I want to support my team, but I don’t know how much longer I can take this.

My (27M) younger brother (25M) started dating this girl, let’s call her Emma (24F). Emma is a “wellness influencer”—you know the type: crystal healing, moon water, ""manifesting your highest self"" BS. And look, I don’t mind if people want to do that for themselves. You do you. But Emma has somehow convinced my brother that her advice is basically life-saving wisdom, and he’s buying it HARD.

It started with small stuff—he stopped drinking coffee because ""caffeine disrupts your soul’s energy vibrations."" Okay, whatever. Then he stopped eating garlic and onions because “they're low-vibration foods that mess with your chakras.” But it’s escalated. Last month, he quit his job because Emma told him his “soul wasn’t meant to work under capitalism,” and now he's been trying to make money by selling “holistic life energy readings” online. Spoiler: he’s made zero dollars.

When he asked me to “support his journey” by buying one of his readings, I finally snapped. I told him, “No offense, but this is absolute horseshit, and Emma’s advice is ruining your life.” He got defensive, saying Emma is helping him “find his purpose” and that I “don’t understand their deeper connection.” He also told me I’m a “brainwashed slave to society” for working a 9-to-5.

Our parents are all over my ass now, saying I’m supposed to “support family” and that I “need to respect his beliefs.” Meanwhile, Emma is posting cryptic Instagram stories about “toxic masculinity” and “negative energy” (I’m 99% sure they’re about me), and my brother’s been ignoring my calls ever since.

I recently got my hands on the Colourpop Lippie Stix in the shade Goldie. This matte lipstick has quickly become a go-to in my makeup routine.

The rich brick burgundy color packs a punch with just one swipe. I was impressed by how smoothly it glided on my lips without any tugging. It feels light and comfortable, and the matte finish looks stunning.

https://preview.redd.it/gvwf8kpxbwxd1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dc86293577a2a9bbb09247d3cf29cd4c9b14607

I noticed the formula contains vitamin E, shea butter, and avocado butter. These ingredients seem to help keep my lips from drying out, even with the super matte finish. The color stays put for hours, which is a big plus for me.

One thing to note is that it's very pigmented. A little goes a long way, so I'm careful not to apply too much. The packaging is simple but sturdy, making it easy to toss in my bag for touch-ups.

# Bottom Line

I think the Colourpop Lippie Stix in Goldie is a great choice for anyone looking for a bold, long-lasting matte lipstick.

# Overview of Colourpop Lippie Stix - Goldie - Matte X

I've tried many lipsticks, but this one stands out. The Lippie Stix in Goldie is a rich brick burgundy shade that caught my eye. It glides on smoothly and feels light on my lips. The matte finish is intense and long-lasting.

I like that it doesn't dry out my lips or crack. The color stays vibrant all day. It's easy to apply and gives full coverage in one swipe. The formula has vitamin E and butters that keep my lips feeling good.

This lipstick is great for bold looks. It's perfect for nights out or when I want to make a statement. The color is unique and eye-catching. While it's very matte, it's not uncomfortable to wear.

# One Stroke Intensity

I was blown away by how much color this Lippie Stix packed in a single swipe. The rich brick burgundy shade showed up vividly on my lips without needing multiple layers. I loved that I could get full, even coverage so quickly and easily. The formula glided on smoothly without tugging at my lips. It felt velvety and comfortable, not dry or chalky like some other matte lipsticks I've tried. The super matte finish looked sleek and stayed put for hours. While it's not the most moisturizing, the intense pigment and long wear make it worth it for a bold lip look.

# Super Matte Finish

I was blown away by the matte finish on this lippie. It's not just matte - it's super matte. The color goes on smooth and dries to a velvety texture that feels light on my lips. I love how it doesn't transfer easily, so I can sip my coffee without leaving marks on the cup. The pigment is strong and stays put for hours. My lips don't feel dry or cracked, even with the intense matte look. It's a big plus that it has vitamin E and shea butter to keep lips soft. The only downside is that it can emphasize lip lines if you don't prep well. Overall, this lippie nails the super matte trend without sacrificing comfort.

# Comfort and Wearability

I was pleasantly surprised by how the Lippie Stix felt on my lips. The formula glides on smoothly without any tugging or discomfort. It's incredibly lightweight - I almost forgot I was wearing lipstick. The matte finish looks great but doesn't dry out my lips like some other matte products I've tried. I could wear it all day without any cracking or flaking. The slim stick shape makes it easy to apply precisely. My only minor gripe is that it can feel a bit dry after several hours, so I'd suggest having some lip balm handy for touch-ups. Overall, the Lippie Stix strikes a good balance between long-lasting color and comfortable wear.

# Formula and Ingredients

I was impressed with the smoothness of this lipstick. The Matte X formula glides on easily and feels lightweight on my lips. It's not drying like some other matte lipsticks I've tried. The pigmentation is strong, giving full coverage with just one swipe. I noticed it lasted for several hours without fading or smudging. The lipstick contains some moisturizing ingredients that help keep lips comfortable. While the exact ingredient list isn't provided, it seems to be made with quality components. The powder form allows for precise application. I found the formula works well for all skin types without causing irritation.

# Pros and Cons

After trying out this lipstick, I've got some thoughts to share. The Colourpop Lippie Stix in Goldie is a matte lipstick that caught my eye. Here's what I found:

# Pros

* The color is bold and eye-catching. I got compliments when I wore it.
* It goes on smoothly in one stroke. No need to keep applying.
* The matte finish looks great and lasts a while.
* The price is good for the quality you get.

# Cons

* The super matte finish can feel dry on the lips.
* The brick burgundy shade might be too intense for some people.
* It can be hard to remove at the end of the day.
* The small size means it might not last as long as other lipsticks.

This Lippie Stix has its ups and downs. I like how it looks, but comfort could be better. It's a good pick if you want a strong lip color that stays put. Just be ready for a very matte feel.

# Customer Reviews

I've been trying out this Lippie Stix lately, and it's been a mixed bag. The bright color is eye-catching - I got a few comments when I wore it out. It's not too pricey, which is nice. The quality seems decent for the cost. But it's not perfect. Some users loved it, while others weren't as thrilled. The ratings average out to about 3.8 stars from 39 people who reviewed it. That's okay, but not amazing. I'd say it's worth a shot if you want to try a bold lip color without spending too much.

# Conclusion

I've enjoyed trying out this bold lip color. The matte finish looks great and lasts for hours without drying out my lips too much. While the shade is eye-catching, it may be a bit much for everyday wear. The affordable price makes it worth experimenting with for special occasions. The small size is handy to toss in my bag. Overall, I'm pleased with the quality and performance for the price point. If you're looking to make a statement with your lip color, this could be a fun option to try.",1,1730295199.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

A company email suggests several ideas on rejuvenating brand image. The desanctification comes to a close. Arbor reminisces about his past. A protest turns violent.*

# Part Two: And to Kill a God

*𐂴 - Orchid Harrow*

I dislike my job. Don’t get me wrong- I don’t hate it, but I certainly don’t love it. But sometimes, as I’m listening to Councilor Aspen Lowe speak on how the “industry is the future”, or how we need to “cut back on some of the old faiths” a little piece of me dies inside.

I campaigned under the slogan “Like an Orchid- Machiryo Bay shall bloom,” I campaigned on the streets and amongst the people. I got to know families, friends, everyone from the dock workers to the shape-magicians that fold our city bricks.  
  
And now I am Councilor Orchid Harrow. 

And now I feel like I brought more positive change during the campaign trail than sitting in a dimly lit room, listening to Sacred Dynamics executives promise to invest in the city again and again, asking for just one more temple to be bought out, one more buyout to approve.

When I was campaigning, year after year, we were able to push the City Council into concessions for the people. Unions, ideas, protests- I was able to spearhead the movement against the move towards mass industrialization.

And now I’m Councilor Orchid Harrow.

And now I’ve been made into one of them. They can’t control an outsider. But they can control a small dissenting force within the council. The New Industry Gods and priests poured liquid gold into their pre-approved politicians like Lowe.

I fought tooth and nail. I worked through donations from the people, not from great conglomerates or hungry men in suits that lived in the high rises of the city. 

“So let’s talk about the protest,” Councilor Lowe begins, standing in the center of the oval room. I shake my head, already hating his next few words. “There are several groups involved in the protest- followers of several other,” he makes a face, “backwards gods. As well as some of the Five Faith gods.”

I speak out against him. He’s going to call for the same thing he’s done the last five protests against Sacred Dynamics buyouts. “You’re going to call for us to forcibly dismantle the protests.”

“An astute prediction!” Lowe declares, mockingly. “We are moving towards a new age and we must show that blood sacrifice and old nonsensical rituals have no place in our society. But-” he glances at me, “some of us don’t believe in this new age. Some of us prefer the age of blood and bones.”

“No,” I answer, “I agree that the Keeper’s people are a backwards faith- blood sacrifice no longer has a place in our society. But our people are concerned their religious freedom may be at risk as well! Just last week in the name of industry we allowed three more temples to be swallowed up by the manufacturing and industry districts- those gods were small faiths- and none utilized blood sacrifice.”

“It is the small price to pay for progress,” Lowe remarks. “We need to make decisions. These small concessions will improve the quality of our people. We’re bringing jobs, people, not dreamers. Do you know how many zoning issues we’ve had before we passed the domain and industry law?”

“We cannot oppress our people,” I add. “There comes a moment where we must truly listen to our people- and they are telling us to *stop-* the unrestricted growth of our industry has gone too far!”

Lowe gives me a snide look, and then he takes a seat. “The political prophet’s guild is in favor of industry,” he turns to a lanky bald man with sigils burned into his skin, “right?”

This is perhaps the most vile person in the assembly. The representative of the Political Prophet’s Temple, Keith Smilings. And it’s become increasingly obvious he’s been bought out by the corporate sector.

Smilings used to be a voice of the people- in the Reform Ages only two decades ago he was hailed as a savior, a rebel. A prophet leading a new movement to break free from the conservative, old gods who demanded unrestrained sacrifice, belief.

He united the two faiths that once fought in bloody waves across the city. He campaigned for the modernization of our city- effective, yes.

But somewhere along the way an executive came along and the good prophet Keith Smilings, visionary of the future dove in and never came back. The respect for the man is running thin.

Nearly all his prophecies seem to mention the corporate interest now, the same regurgitated lines of new developments being good for jobs, for growth, for the people in the long run.

And people still believe him. Some of them, at least. 

He speaks. “Yes, indeed- I, er, have seen the visions. By expanding our factories, our market, we will be inviting growth. The Mother-of-Visions has revealed this to me. These new developments- as well as more developments I foresee in collaboration with Sacred Dynamics will bring benefits to everyone. Such it has been revealed to me.”

The benefits seem pretty exclusive.

I rest my voice- it’s no use arguing when a significant majority of the city council has been bought out. The rest of the meeting goes as always: watch the situation, then let Keith Smilings talk to the public, and then, if the protests intensify, declare their actions unreasonable and allow the police to break it up with force.

It is the same strategy we’ve been using since the negotiations that allowed the business district to swallow a fifth of the lower temple district. And every time, the protests grow louder, more angry.

It doesn’t matter anymore if the gods are controversial- the first two temples were barbaric faiths, gods to blood and the dead. But now it doesn’t matter. It’s too much. And the people are rallying with each other.

And no matter the signs we aren’t doing anything. We can just whip out the old political prophet and validate our actions as divinely secure.

It’s cruel. There is a scale to industry and the respect of the faith. And right now, the scales are extremely tipped to one end.

Machiryo Bay may be hidden away from the rest of the country- but make no mistake- it is still *very much American.*

**To:** [jan.korsov@dynamics.sdc](mailto:jan.korsov@dynamics.sdc)

**Subject:** Alleviating Our Brand Image 

Hi Branch Leader Jan,

My name is Gwen Duchess Kip, and I’m one of the heads for PR and Brand Image under your management. I’m pretty sure, but be sure to check with the database that I’m supposed to be talking to you about this.  
  
I’m writing about the current state of our brand image. Since the beginning of the business expansion and the eminent domain agreement with City Council our favorability ratings have gone down around 6%, and our growth division is telling me that number might fall somewhere between 12-16% if we don’t get this under control.  
  
Our readers are telling my division that the current look on Sacred Dynamics as a whole is seen as new, out of touch, and not with the people. So I contacted the think tank boys upstairs, the ones we’ve got hooked up to those god-devices or whatever and we came up with some ideas.  
  
Remember that god of dust shrine we finally deconsecrated last week? I did some research and it looks like the elders let us buy it out- most of the protests were just other faiths and the fundamentalists in the faith.   
  
My colleague Joan talked to them and they’re willing to work out a deal- I’ve attached the notes from the meeting. We cover double their compensation fee and we get to use their god.  
  
We can brand him on our sub-company, the coffee one? I’m thinking we change that scorpion-faced thing into something animated, cute, a slogan with “Let the SDC-270 coffee grinder dust off your worries for a refreshed day!”  
  
I sent it over to our test readers and they tell us that it looks like we understand the people more, we’re empathizing and improving their faith and livelihoods. Money goes to ensure they don’t relocate to a sacrifice district, we get a product boost, and the news outlets get to say we’re charitable.   
  
So I’m thinking we talk to the elders at the Cairn Keeper’s temple we’re trying to demolish now and make some sort of deal- if the public see we’re helping these people, especially these old fundamentalist blood-sacrifice faiths change and help our community, we’d be up at least 2%. This sort of slice-of-life endorsements will really help us in the, well, the poor districts, the sacrifice zones.  
  
Now I have this other concern. 

I know I’m not really supposed to talk about this since it isn’t my division- but our test agents in the fields have reported back that certain groups of the public- conspiracy fundamentalists, really, have doubts about that experimental god we made.

It’s the one that nullifies magic. The one we use for desanctification- the conspiracy theorists are calling it the The Hollow Between. Yeah- they think one day we won’t be able to control it and it’ll blow up in everyone’s faces.   
  
I don’t know who’s leaking the experimental theology division’s stuff- but as I recall, the experimental god is supposed to be an inside thing, right?  
  
I also think we’re overusing the Political Prophet we’ve paid for. If we use him too much we’ll lose the public vote. That should be all- please get back to me as soon as you can.

Regards,

Gwen Duchess Kip

*𐂷 - Arbor Moss*

The inside of the temple is labyrinthine, winding, but we make our way quickly enough. Even from down here, we can still hear the protests. We’re nearing the center of the temple now, to its most sacred of all shrines. 

Once we set the charges, destroy the sanctification, we’re done. The monks lose their protective spells and magic, and we win. We get paid double, and I get to go home to my little apartment on Elm Street and take a well needed rest.  
  
But now there’s a temple guardian in front of us. It looks like it once human- or it was made in the image of a man. It’s a golem of some sort, a construct of floating rock and clay.  
  
It stands guard at a large door leading into the shrine we need to nullify. Cairns line the room. Its face is a smooth oval stone, white and stained with dried red blood. A ring of sharp stone stalactites surrounds its head like a dark halo.  
  
It notices us and it knows we’re here to kill it. Maren laughs giddily and kicks one of the cairns to the ground. “Step aside, old boy,” she snarls, raising a pistol. The markings on the pistol grow bright, ready to neutralize the creature.  
  
In turn, the markings carved into the construct shimmer as well. I reach into my pockets and retrieve a set of cards. I choose one. I’m ready.  
  
The temple construct moves silent, stones gliding through the air- it lunges and three stone knives detach itself from its halo and charge at me. I fold the card and throw it into the air- and a barrier forms, and the knives shatter.  
  
Maren fires twice at the construct, and when it backs off and sends three stones flying her way, she ducks.   
  
More stones rally their way at me. I defend myself, tossing more and more cards. Maren gets close enough- and with her other hand, reaches for a ritual knife from her belt and slashes one the arms of the construct away.  
  
It backs in pain- and I slip closer, and with another, new card, I place it dead-center upon its featureless face.  
  
And then, cast by the experimental god of nullification, its sigils carved into its stone-flesh melt away, falling like skin to the ground. And then it clatters to the floor, defeated.  
  
The card dissolves. “That wasn’t so bad,” I remark, picking up a stone as a trophy.   
  
“Arbor, you know the company says no trophies,” Maren reminds, a tinge of humor in her voice. “Trophies are a sign of psychological distress.”  
  
“Right,” I head towards the stone gate and begin to decode its locking sigil. “What about those dust-fingers you took off that mummified priest from the last domain seizure?”  
  
“What dust fingers?” she smiles, and we begin to unlock the door. She shouts now. “Hey- if anyone is behind this door- your construct is dead. You have lost this battle!”  
  
Nobody answers- but I hear voices, small, scared. The sound of protests have faded, now replaced by sewage water dripping behind me. “You know what this reminds me of?”  
  
“The supply closet last week?” Maren jokes.   
  
I laugh. “No,” I murmur, “reminds me of the head office. All those people, nothing to say.”  
  
“What do you mean?” she asks.  
  
“Well we all go in for the meetings and training right?” I begin, almost done deciphering the code. “They talk about sustainability and conduct in the field or whatever, but we all know it doesn’t really matter. I mean we’re here. I know upper management practically pressured the council to give up this temple.”  
  
“I get what you mean,” she replies. We’re almost through. “Empty room. All bureaucrats. None of them do the dirty work but us- here-” she guides my hand to the right symbol, “ it’s the witness mark.”  
  
And then the stone gate of murals swings open. And there’s shouts in the dimly lit room, young, small shouts. I take a step back and breathe in through my teeth. This is probably the worst part.  
  
“Well look at that,” Maren muses, “it’s a bunch of kids.”  
  
Maren doesn’t have a problem with it. I look away. I do. Because once upon a time, I was a kid too.

\*\*Ami Zhou: “\*\*Welcome back listeners- this is Ami Zhou reporting live outside the Cairn Keeper’s temple. Just moments ago the city council authorized police intervention to break up the gathering of defiance against Sacred Dynamic’s desanctification of this sacred site.” 

\*\*Lind Quarry: “\*\*I believe, listeners, that these are necessary measures. These protestors were warned multiple times and now with police involved, things will soon return to stability. Sacred Dynamics, of course, has government authorization to seize this site in the name of progress.”

**Ami Zhou:** “But are these protestors not defending their beliefs and right to property? They were barely given warning that force would escalate this way, that-” **\[GUNSHOT\]** “That was a gunshot. Lind, did you hear that?”

**Lind Quarry:** “A gunshot? That’s exaggerated, surely the police wouldn’t escalate to that point of aggression without severe aggravation- likely a star-mark, or-”

**Ami Zhou:** “Do you hear that? Someone’s down- a monk- this isn’t keeping the peace- this is a goddamn assault!” **\[SEVERAL MORE GUNSHOTS\]**

**Lind Quarry:** “Now let’s be rational. Sacred Dynamics have invested too much- this is the price of aggravated protest. It’s unfortunate, but it’s a sacrifice we have to pay in the name of progress.”

**Protestor Two:** “Down with Sacred Dynamics! We are a city of faith, not steel!” 

**Ami Zhou:** “*Sacrifices?!* That was someone’s goddamn life, Lind!- \[STATIC\] -a person who believed in defending his faith. His land. How much further will -\[STATIC\]- and the city go?! How many more lives-”

**LOUDSPEAKER:** “An anti-record sigil is now in place. Cease this protest and record-making- it will be no use. Go home and continue your duties. This act is authorized by the center city security department. Please, leave peacefully or face arrest.”

*𐂷 - Arbor Moss*

This was during the reform ages, back when I was really young. Back when the New Industrialists were only beginning their rise to power, back when they were small and in the shadows. Back when the main threat was one of ritual blood sacrifice.

The protests weren’t about the industrialists back then. It was about the two of the old five faiths that fought and bled out in the streets of the city. This was back before the legislation of the sacrifice districts- back then, only the rich would be free from the threat of death by holy order.  
  
It’s different now. The sacrifice districts, the fundamentalist councilors claim, are a key part of their beliefs. Places where sacrifice to the gods genuinely blesses the people the industry cannot.  
  
But it’s not so different. 

The sacrifice districts house the poorest of the poor. The councilor Orchid Harrow campaigned to end the sacrifice districts- and to their credit, their campaign forced the government to reduce the size of several of the larger ones.

But then they got elected. And then they were gone. No more campaigns. And the poor remain unable to lift themselves out of poverty, save for the volunteering and a contract to one of the fundamentalist gods to be marked and sacrificed in a years time.  
  
When I was a kid, there was a different type of seizure. And I was on the receiving end.   
  
The thing that set it all off wasn’t really one thing. It was many. It was progress, one new experimental sigil, then a new god, and then the introduction of \*heretic\* technology like the computer.

I remember hearing, as a young child on the radio that the Machriyo Bay University had just invented a new, experimental god. A god of wellbeing, a god that didn’t require blood sacrifice- only a small place on the windowsill to sit on, and a dedication to your own mental well being.

You showed the god that you were helping yourself by cleaning, reading, meditating and in turn, it would reward you and your dedication by giving, on a little plate at its altar, a coin or two from the ether.

Nothing much, in today’s age of new gods and industry, but back then- this was unheard of. Miracles without divine sacrifice.

This set the fundamentalists off. They were in charge of the council and the city back then, and they squabbled. The worst of them were the worshippers of Calayu, and the worshippers of Mae’yr. 

They enacted policies against new experimental things, a call back to our origins, to sacrifice. In response, the university students protested. The city president called for a stop. People continued to rally across the city to embrace a newer age.

Counter protestors, the fundamentalists began rioting back. There was gunfire in the streets. Tensions continued to grow- dividing the old and the young. 

And then the council ordered the police to wipe the heretics off the map. And for the first time in a century, the two faiths of the Salamander and the Weather Bird truly united, and police and fanatics descended on the university protest.

I remember coming home from school one day. 

I also remember hearing the sound of singing. And I remember a body hanging from a tree, the corpse hollowed out and branded with the sacred mark of Mae’yr, so that the wind sang through the hollow, sacred body and produced a divine choir.

The fundamentalist fanatics had gone wild. Reverends and priors and so called- faith-patriots and prophets called their people to action- to cleanse the unbelievers and a return to the Five Noble Faiths.

My family and parts of my neighborhood worshiped a smaller god, a little god of labor, one that only required small sacrifice. A caught rat, a dog, a little animal to be rewarded with clarity, luck at work and school.

I remember the shrine being destroyed by a priest of Calayu. Holy fire reducing it to ashes.

I remember we and some of the others began to meet in secret at my house, which had a basement and made our sacrifices there. And I remember city-sponsored fanatical morality agents at our doorstep one day.

Me and the other children were told to hide in a secret room under the basement, where most of the carvings and holy books were.

But they found us. Seizure. Eminent domain. City-sponsored.

Maren doesn’t understand. She grew up worshiping Mae’yr. She was safe. Her family was richer. Mine was not. Our temple was destroyed and I never saw my family again. I was taken into a city orphanage.

So I understand the fear on the children’s faces when Maren tells them to leave, when she nullifies and destroys the shrine to their god. But their faith still requires blood sacrifice. 

And that is something that I cannot truly empathize with, no matter how small. Because the old gods always demand more. They are hungry, vicious things. And we are small.

**\[Silence. Light jazz begins.\]**

**Ami Zhou:** “Machiryo Bay, it’s Ami Zhou. As the day comes to a close, so has the struggle at the Temple of the Cairn Keeper. What we witnessed today was a stark reminder of corporate influence versus community values. But more troubling is how swiftly a Prophet- and the police can be wielded to unethically validate unrestricted corporate expansion.”

**Lind Quarry:** “Now, hold on, Ami. This was about progress, and Sacred Dynamics has a proven record of revitalizing communities and providing opportunities. People will remember that.”

**Ami Zhou:** “Opportunities built on the back of what, Lind? Faiths trampled underfoot? Elders, families, generations of worshippers torn from their own heritage? At what point does ‘progress’ become tyranny? The protests here could escalate- a harrowing reminder of the atrocities of our city’s reform era!”

**Lind Quarry:** “Ami, let’s not exaggerate. Progress is uncomfortable. The Prophet’s guidance might not satisfy everyone, but it’s a reflection of a better future.”

**Ami Zhou:** “You heard it here, listeners: a ‘future’ where profit-driven companies can call upon prophets to predict and manipulate the government. Where small faiths can be legally ousted- and relocated into sacrifice districts! That’s government sponsored murder! How do we ensure this does not lead to tyranny? How do we know when we’ve gone too far?”

**Lind Quarry:** “Let’s keep it cool. We are a democracy, and nothing will change that. But change is here, whether we’re ready or not.”

**Ami Zhou:** “And some of us wonder- when all this is said and done- will we recognize our city- or will we be transformed into something completely alien?”

He has done things like choke me, punch my arms and legs, throw hot coffee on me, etc. He is also emotionally abusive towards me, when we get into disagreements he will name call, talk poorly of my family and call them names, etc. I am not naive to the fact that I am a victim of spousal abuse, and I am not the type of person to normally be passive, I am usually Very vocal and stick up for myself, but I don't know how I got into this situation.

1gfmevm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1gfmevm/addicted_to_sugar_at_work/,Addicted to sugar at work,"My school has four “workrooms,” which serve as a room for doing general-purpose class prep (making copies, etc.) and also a lunch/break room. I’m one of the only people who routinely uses all four of them.

**Upstairs D Hall**: Closest to my own classroom, I usually have lunch there.  
**Upstairs C Hall**: The one closest to most science teachers, so we hang out as a team there sometimes.  
**Downstairs D Hall**: Where I leave my bike in the morning (and change into slacks), since it doesn’t involve carrying a bike upstairs.  
**Downstairs C Hall**: Where everyone is supposed to have meetings with instructional coaches.

I help myself to the free coffee every day. I don’t even like coffee. I only get coffee so I can put cream in it, which is loaded with sugar. I tell myself, *“I’m getting coffee for a little extra energy, so I’ll teach class more enthusiastically; I’m doing it to be a better teacher!”* But I know I’m not. I tell myself this even while fully understanding I’m only drinking it for the sugar.

Nearly every day, someone in the building brings donuts, or cookies, or muffins or something, and leaves them in a workroom. So if you go to all four workrooms, you’ll find sugar. After leaving my bike in downstairs D Hall, if there’s not sugar there, I’ll go to another workroom “for coffee,” but I’m really looking for sugar. If there’s no sugar, I’ll get a cup of water, then try another workroom. I don’t want people to know I’m prowling all over the school looking for sugar, so I make it look like I’m only there for water or coffee.

Once I’ve found the sugar (about 80% of the time, I find some), I take one cookie/donut/whatever. Just one. I don’t want anyone to know I’m going to have more than one. I tell myself it’s OK to have just one, even though I know it’s never just one.

During my conference period, guess where I go to get some work done?  
*“No, I’m not going there for the sugar; I only want a change of scenery. I want to get out of my windowless, echo-y lab room for an hour.”* That's all true, but it’s really for the sugar. When I first get there, I have another cookie. And by the end of the hour, another. I might also have another sugar-loaded coffee.

Guess where I go for lunch? That’s cookie/donut #4. And no one saw me take more than one.

After I’ve had one, my brain immediately goes, *“...and* ***another*** *one!”* The urge to have the second and third one is even stronger than the first. I can’t get a small fix and be satisfied. Once I have any, I lose all self-control.

After school, if there are any left, *another*. Maybe two more if no one’s looking; this is my last chance, after all. By the end of the day, I’ve had 2,000+ calories, almost entirely made up of sugar, with some saturated fat thrown in, and basically nothing else. No protein, no iron, no fiber, almost nothing but sugar. I don’t bring lunch to school because I know I’m going to eat too much, even without one. Then I ride my bike home and eat a salad and an orange.

At home, I eat healthy. I don’t have any sugar at home, and it’s easy to resist in the grocery store. At the store, you only have to resist the idea of eating sugar *later*, which always sounds like a good plan anyway. And you’re saving money by not buying it! But when there are boxes full of sweets right there, in front of you *now*, and they’re *free*, and someone brought them *for you*, it’s a lot harder.

This is especially embarrassing because I normally keep myself in good shape. Only about 30-40 American have ever run a 100-mile footrace in under 15 hours, and two years ago, I became one of them. But I'm currently 22 pounds over my race weight, and on a guy who's 5'5"", that's a *lot*. I've gained 9 pounds in only the past five weeks, largely because there's constantly been Halloween treats around.

I hardly run anymore, both because I can't find the time (thanks to my job), and because I always feel like crap (thanks to the sugar, found at my job). So I don't even do the one thing which might help burn it off.

I think I mostly wanted to say this ""aloud"" simply as a first step toward fixing the problem. Does anyone here have advice for how to resist sugar at work?",0,1730294589.0,Teachers,2,0.5,False

We have an almost 9 month old. She wasn’t planned but we were so happy to be parents. She’s honestly a fantastic baby and just the most amazing thing ever. But ever since I gave birth my relationship with my husband has just slowly been falling apart. 

I don’t even know how to describe the change. But we went from being perfectly in sync and loving to now having an awful time communicating. He’s pushed me away any time I’ve reached out to him for help, saying I should ask someone else or learn to be an adult. When I ask for help he’s asked if I’m asking for myself or asking for the baby. He’s had multiple overnights away since she’s been born, either to visit friends, go camping, or for work. 

He tells me I can do the same, that I’m allowed to ask for time to do fun things, but I can’t ask for his help when things are hard, so how can I go and ask for his help when I want to do something fun? I feel like I’m always doing something wrong, like I’m never good enough for him. I tried opening up about my self image/body struggles postpartum and he said I was being too negative. He says I only talk about the same things over and over. 

We used to share everything. We had a relationship all our friends and family admired. Multiple times he would surprise me with homemade picnics, day trips, dinner, coffee. He told me I wouldn’t be forgotten once the baby came. Now he’s upset any time I have a need. He says he has to have infinite energy for everyone and everything around him, that he doesn’t matter. 

He goes for bike rides, hikes, sees friends, plays guitar, writes, knits. I always make sure he has time for his activities. He says I can do what I want too, and gets upset when I don’t, but if I take time for myself will I be called childish again? Will I be told I’m not really an adult and I don’t know how to be responsible? 

I know he’s stressed. He’s working and I’m at home to save us money and am also going back to school full time. 

He got me tickets to a concert for Mother’s Day, but the concert wasn’t until October. When we went he was on his phone checking on our daughter. I didn’t know, so gave him a look, and he yelled at me that he was trying to be responsible and make sure nothing happened to her. 

Idk, I know this is a mess. I’m sorry. I’m trying to get us into couple’s therapy but every therapist either doesn’t take our insurance or has cancelled on us. He just started with a new therapist on his own, and I have mine as well.

Tl;dr my relationship is falling apart. We used to be perfectly in sync and loving, but since having a baby it feels like he resents me and just doesn’t like me anymore.",2,1730294386.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

Oh, folks, you know things are getting spicy - right on schedule. Let's take a moment to thank our good man, Keith Patrick Gill, for his hard work on developing and publicizing his investment thesis way back in 2019 and 2020. I know that not only would I not be here were it not for him, but I also wouldn't be nearly as a developed a market and US Financial system participant as I am. There certainly would be no Open Interest newsletter. For this and so much more am I grateful. Cheers, Keith! 

All praise aside, we have some thinking to do today and some data points to work into our narratives and forecasts. It might be low resolution for the moment, but let's see what we can put together!

**Price Movement Recap**

[Trading Day 10\/29 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/dx14ry46evxd1.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=84739a60dee489e70c23e240f9f97f364b535c2a)

A thing of beauty, is it not? Let's go over what happened yesterday. 

The star of the show early was our $22 price level and high positive GEX strike. Flows were heavily bearish right off the open driving us straight down to test that low-volatility gamma position. As soon as momentum slowed, traders flipped the switch and bullish flow started pouring in, carrying us up to the 200-min moving average. The price cooled off once more, but failed to get a full retrace back to $22.09 and yielded control of the days to bulls who carried us right up and through the large gamma position at $23 for an intraday high of $23.20. Some selling took us down to VWAP where we stabilized and traded mostly flat/neutral-bullish almost into the close, where some clandestine conventional shorting (about 200,000) shares came in about 10min prior to the close to get our closing price as low as possible. The final premium balance was almost dead-even:

With Keith's 13G/a drop, it looks like some shorts might have immediately run for the exits, walking the price all of the way up to $24 AH.

The most humorous thing I saw come up during yesterday's trading was the following:

After Monday's MASSIVE bullish flows and our still slightly bullish-biased flows yesterday (not to mention Keith's CATalyst) I think its fair to say...

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Max Pain is unbudged at $20.50 this week, which is important to keep in mind - but this might not matter as we move upward to establish a new trading bracket into November.  Let's see what our OI shifts looked like yesterday:

[11\/1 OI Changes 10\/29-10\/30](https://preview.redd.it/q42qpmdpkvxd1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=87a3d07a037842651dc32dbd2814fbb536e9b382)

With almost a dead even options premium sentimental skew on the day, we can expect a mix of bullish and bearish shifts to have occurred. We see new, short dated call OI piling up at a few key strikes, but a significant retraction in Call OI at a few strikes as traders reposition based on yesterday's activity.

[OI Change here was BUY to close - this was a SHORT who got on the $22 test](https://preview.redd.it/5er0gkrqjvxd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aa18ae397c159e3e758af18ed49a87c694a8298)

[OI Change here was SELL to close - this was a LONG who took profit](https://preview.redd.it/2tgyf7gvjvxd1.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddace8aa5f256b2e144bc4f88e6b051d6c083387)

[OI Change here is a little harder to tell since we have a lot of mixed ATM volume, but seems likely to have been a LONG taking profit early](https://preview.redd.it/sb5h8a70kvxd1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce1daf9a8bd6c36a16931676a79a3df5fb5a6acc)

We can see the same trend emerge with respect to our OI for 11/8, though on a smaller scale:

[11\/8 OI Changes 10\/29-30](https://preview.redd.it/63g407jr5wxd1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9cd2e885bfa0824c72e001aa258bb72ed9a03e7)

11/15 OPEX was a bit more modest, but still hosted some big bets and notable repositionings based on yesterday's price action. The $20 Call OI and $21.5 expansion was a mix of Long and Short OI, while the $21 Put OI expansion was entirely short (bullish). The $30 were also mostly at the BID.

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 10\/29-10\/30](https://preview.redd.it/d1k5nk846wxd1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=445777fb1220c17219505f3616103613b021484e)

**Gamma Exposure**

So you know that crazy low Put/Call GEX 1:4 ratio from yesterday? Yeah, it's even lower now at almost 5:1.

https://preview.redd.it/pltuknc3tvxd1.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=d709fa7850c34923c1e06fc5e888bd6a9a653dfd

There are only 4 days this year (there's one I missed yesterday) where the ratio has been more bullish: 

5/10: 0.19 (roughly 1:5, around now)  
5/13: 0.08 (1:12.5, damn)  
5/14: 0.04 (1:25, holy wow!)  
6/3: 0.11 (roughly 1:10)

So are current ratios are suggestive of the conditions that produced the bullish grind up (5/1-5/9ish), but not yet at the absurd 1:12.5 and 1:25 ratios that fueled Sneeze 2.0. 

So what does this look like in our daily table?

https://preview.redd.it/n95mysp7jvxd1.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ebf8e8c74f0a78d6de169d1586f1dfc460596b0

It looks like Green. This is the pinnacle of stable bullish trading. We have big, net-positive GEX positions beneath us at essentially every whole dollar strike down to $20 and above us up to $25.

Why does this matter?

Firstly, this makes every whole dollar a downside support \*if it is mounted\*. The price cannot fall easily through this level without significant bearish capital commitment. A lot of our bearish volume so far, however, has been call selling, not put buying, by a wide margin (as reflected in the GEX ratios). Why is this significant? If these contracts are sold beneath, above, or at our current price points, it continues to 'positivize' our gamma hedge environment. This might slow down rises in the short term intraday... but it also slows down depreciation at the same time. 

The name of the game in a continued uptrend is STABILITY. Why stability? Stability attracts NEW MONEY. Every Ape in Superstonk has basically already YOLO'd every spare penny he or she has made into the Stonk. WE'VE kept the price where it is despite the best Bear efforts to stimulate price collapse. At this point, the upward volatility of the Stonk depends upon new money flooding in that sees whatever our current price point happens to be as a STABLE floor. Instability makes for paper hands. 

Obviously, we've got somebody like Keith hoarding cash to bankroll this momentum himself (probably until he owns the whole float), but, still, some reflexivity on the part of the broader market - retail and institutions alike - is what can turn this into the steadily peaking SLOASS that could FAR overextend the 2021 Sneeze, which was destined to go - per Peterffy - 'into the thousands.'

Look for intraday seesaw play between whole-dollar strikes (like yesterday) to see if we can mount and claim new whole-dollar support levels. If we can capture and hold $22, $23, $24 into and throughout mid-November, the approach of Q3 earnings and its attendant IV ramp up can take us deep into the $25-30 bracket we saw in early July.

If Q3 earnings is good - and it'll probably be great - we will probably see $30 breakout in Mid-December... and the Requel will be in full swing.

Marge might come calling this Christmas if everything lines up right. 

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/3kyv4xn80wxd1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf5b526ba7177d25cc8fb6d4139fe1d7782c6d0)

So take all this please with a grain of salt - or a spoon even. I call this a doodle for a reason - that you not take it too seriously or precisely. Symbolically, this represents the two phases I think we will enter into over the next two months. First: if I understand our price movement correctly, we will be moving into a new technical paradigm shaped by a mounting of the 50-day SMA. This is the paradigm we operated in during Q4 of 2020:

[7\/1-1\/11\/2020 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/mdtetd2w0wxd1.png?width=1457&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e23e39818547f7b05477448aafb47b8d2cf082)

GME's bull trend that year actually started in July of 2020, though the breakout characteristic wasn't apparaent until the Q2 earnings report at the beginning of September. Nonetheless, the 50-day SMA support paradigm was in place and remained formatively supportive on the Bull trend into January. Our price appreciation might not play out exactly as it did back in 2020 frame for frame this Winter, but I propose that the same technical paradigm will emerge and predominate in our trading. November will be the key month for us to establish this trend. Only once we have consolidated at our new price levels - perhaps even atop $25 - will we start to lift off.

Of course, this is purely an assessment based on our current technicals and trading environment. I'm fully expecting new information to start flowing in exponentially that could reconfigure these shapes and frameworks. ""It's going to be a busy (demanding, fluctuating, but exciting) few weeks, gentlemen.""

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/x4rw1piz3wxd1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=267b60ff9ef0aa114bf81c1c2783737c99b71293

So, yeah, our options activity yesterday - more neutral, still relatively high volume, but skewed slightly bullish caused IV depreciation intraday and into our close. IV algos don't update the values based on AH activity until open, but I would expect a decent jump in IV at open based on last night's action. It currently looks like AH trading is walking the price down as close to $23 as possible in order to test that level (an even larger positive GEX position than $22 was yesterday). If it holds and we establish $23-$24 as our intraday trading range, expect IV levels to stay elevated versus yesterday's activity.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

A test of $23 is likely off our open, but if it holds, it'll bode well for consolidation into November and the steps necessary to build out a bull trend into the Q3 earnings report - which itself amid consolidated, bullish conditions will act as a catalyst for more upward volatility. IV looks to stay elevated so long as we stay up in our current range. Things might, however, get a little choppy and a little speedier than we have gotten used to over the past couple months now that we've got 4-5x the premium $$$ sloshing around the options chain. Let's stay Zen, folks, let's see what RCEO and Keith have up their sleaves, and let's see if we can get that golden stable November necessary to leg us up even further into December and January. 

Good luck out there!

Cheers

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor.

1gfm5bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1gfm5bh/is_there_anything_im_missing/,Is there anything I’m missing?,"I’ve had constant urinary urge on and off since late 2019. I prefer the term *persistency*, [defined by researchers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37891217/) “as a persistent feeling of needing to urinate regardless of urine volume.”  I’m female and currently 34. Have posted here before under a different username but have spent most of my time on the pelvic floor subreddit. Returning again because my urinary urge has returned after 2+ years of remission and on the fifth anniversary of my symptoms first worsening, I wondered if I’m missing any potential causes and treatments of these symptoms.

**I suspect my cause is neuromuscular, but am open to other potential causes.** 

\- My main system is constant urge to void, regardless of volume, not worsened by bladder filling but rather by emptying.

\- I’m seemingly not diet sensitive: sometimes I avoid coffee because peeing multiple times revs up my symptoms but when I got better I had been drinking coffee daily for a year. I also did an insane elimination diet for six months, eating nothing but brown rice, eggs, and blueberries, with no improvement in symptoms.

\- This was not preceded by any UTI. I had slowly worsening frequency throughout the summer and autumn of 2019 and then developed constant urgency on November 1, 2019, the day after I wore a ridiculous pair of heels to a Halloween party.

\- Worse during my luteal phase and sometimes almost entirely better during my period. 

\- Worse during the cold: in three consecutive years I was quite a lot better during the summer and then had severe flare-ups in early November, right as it was getting cold in the UK. Even when I was 90-95% better I had several instances where I had two, three-day flares just from getting cold (e.g. radiator stopped working in the bedroom, or temperature dropped late one summer night and I was out without a jacket for hours).

\- I once had a three-day flare triggered by emptying my bowels a stupid number of times in 24 hours due to illness: I think it overly stressed my pelvic floor

\- Bladder urge seems to come from the periurethral tissue on the underside of my bladder, near where the G spot is. I sporadically had urethral pain before getting on amitriptyline.

\- Once had a better period after being diazepam for two weeks but could have been a coincidence. Recently experimenting with short-term baclofen but hard to tell if it's helping

Six months after I developed the constant bladder urge, I developed unilateral PGAD, or more specifically an intense spot of nerve pain just down and to the right of my clitoris on my vulva. We think I slowly developed it during my six months of bladder persistency, as my musculoskeletal dysfunction progressed, and that it was unmasked when I slowly tapered off the amitriptyline.

Anaesthetic tests revealed the PGAD is not coming from my vulva or anything at my spine (eg. Tarlov cyst, annular tear) but from the nerves between, thought to be either the anterior branch of the pudendal nerve or the genitofemoral nerve, although never confirmed with nerve blocks. Fortunately, amitriptyline and gabapentin mask that nerve pain or I’d likely still have it. At that time, I’d never had any surgery, childbirth, or accidents that could have caused nerve entrapment or damage so doctors assumed the cause was musculoskeletal, probably caused by faulty biomechanics. 

I had a long history of sacroiliac joint dysfunction on the same side, although it had been misdiagnosed as sciatica for years. Around the time the PGAD started, I developed right-sided hip pain and dysfunction, which eventually escalated to the point that I was limping and barely able to walk. At one point I got out of a vulva nerve pain and hip flare by minimising all walking for three weeks.

I started treatment with a good pelvic floor physiotherapist who is also an osteopath. She found a refractory spasm in my right obturator internus, coccygeus, and levatori ani muscles, and some more mild tension on the left pelvic floor. There’s also a lot of tension in my periurethral fascia: she says it’s like my urethra is being tugged to the left a bit.

We struggled to get those muscles to relax on their own and started addressing causes for their spasm outside the pelvic floor, including the SI joint issue, anterior pelvic tilt and twist, my unstable hip, a glute that wasn’t firing. As my hip dysfunction worsened, I had investigations which revealed moderate hip dysplasia (shallow socket), along with a labral tear and impingement. Hip injections just seemed to flare up that hip pain and my degree of dysplasia means I’m not not a good candidate for any hip surgery short of a replacement. [Hip dysfunction has been linked to vulva and bladder pain](https://musculoskeletalkey.com/private-eyes-on-the-hip-sometimes-a-culprit-in-pelvic-pain-and-pelvic-floor-disorders/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2CctNnQTiX5n4tsqrLGEeZxunUbTg9omgD40OE4r8lGUUhQXsAtCcW_BE_aem_xNJX5SPxAIlM6fBcw3X9-Q).

In late 2021, I met someone new, was happy for the first time in ages, and over the next few months the bladder urge just… dissipated. At that point, I’d been in physiotherapy for over a year. I think physio, some kind of mind-body connection, or even us having lots of sex helped the symptoms recede. I had like three flareups in the next year: twice at the traditionally worst time in my cycle (days 20-21) and then once in the cold. 

I got pregnant in late 2022. Continued to go to physiotherapy twice a month and was fine until my third trimester except for two flare-ups related to getting cold. During the third trimester I had sporadic bladder urge. I figured this was due to loss of core strength. However, I’m curious about the hormonal influence on my symptoms, after reading about people with IC who go into remission during pregnancy. I was ok for nearly a year beforehand but wonder if pregnancy masked some of the deterioration in MSK stuff I was likely already experiencing as baby stretched out my core muscles. Like maybe through high levels of relaxin?

I had an elective c-section in July 2023. I was certain that any pushing about aggravate my pelvic floor issues. And this was a very wise decision because I was basically symptom-free for months postpartum, didn’t even flare in the cold. I wonder now if this is due to low oestrogen and progesterone while breastfeeding.

My physio went on leave to have her own baby when mine was two months old, and while I tried other practitioners no one could really help in the same way. In  March of this year, I started getting the constant urge again. I think there are several potential causes: I had spent six months without treatment by my physio, my hormones were shifting again as baby started eating more solids (got period back in April), and baby was really heavy by this point and had to be picked up from the floor multiple times a day. 

I’ve been bad again since March. Been back in physio with my PT since September and feel I’m making progress restrengthening my muscles and re-stabilising my pelvis. I wonder if I had been “bad” for a while beforehand but it was being masked by some hormonal thing while breastfeeding. I'm struggling to cope day to day although and am terrified I'm not going to get out of this again.

Am I overthinking this and it’s just obviously neuromuscular and will settle down again with appropriate physiotherapy? 

I’m also considering as possible root causes, reasons for the exacerbation:

* adhesions from c section scar - although pain is very similar to last time
* inguinal hernia - these can cause genitofemoral irritation and genifemoral irritation can cause bladder urgency. My hip pain mostly presents as groin pain
* Uterine fibroid - one was found in an early pregnancy scan but wasn’t there at later scans. They tend to shrink during pregnancy and breastfeeding but often reoccur and can press on the bladder
* More hip dysplasia stuff - wondering if I can rehab again without addressing what’s probably the root cause of my unstable pelvis: my unstable hip
* candida infection - I had oral thrush a few months before this all started, although my frequency was already ramping up before that

I’ve never had any bladder-based treatment for this. When this first happened, my local NHS hospital was the one in the UK prescribing long-term antibiotics for urinary tract symptoms and I did three years of antibiotics (eeek) with no impact on my symptoms. Never had a positive UTI at any point. It’s never made sense to me that a bladder wall problem could cause one-sided nerve pain, localised to a very specific nerve dermatome. But I guess I could have developed two entirely different things within six months of each other (IC and hip issues causing PGAD).

Sorry this is so long! Wanted to detail the whole story in case people can identify a path I haven't gone down.

Voting was simply providing your TX identification. They give you a blank paper. You walk to a ballot machine and load the paper. It’s electronic like an iPad where you click each candidate. You can review your choices at the end and it prints out the final ballot. 

You then load this printed ballot into another machine and get your sticker.

My fiancé and I both work full-time, but I work from home while he commutes 30-45 minutes each way. He usually wakes up around 5:45 a.m., makes himself breakfast, showers, and heads out the door by 7:10. I wake up a bit later, around 6:00 a.m., and use that time to have coffee and read the news before getting our son up at 6:30. After that, I make his breakfast, pack his lunch, and help him get ready for school. My fiancé leaves for work at the same time I leave to take our son to the bus stop, and I’m back home around 7:30. Since I don’t start work until 8:30, I use this hour to walk our dog, shower, and prepare for my day.

At the end of the school day, I use my lunch break to pick up our son from the bus stop, help him settle in, and make sure he starts on any homework. Sometimes he has after-school clubs, and I drive to pick him up. I handle all the daily household chores: I do all the dishes (we don’t have a dishwasher), all the laundry, and all the major cleaning, including deep-cleaning the kitchen and bathroom.

Recently, I was very sick with pneumonia and couldn’t do anything for about a week. When I recovered, I felt overwhelmed by all the dishes and laundry that had piled up. My fiancé took care of me and our son during that time, but he didn’t manage the usual chores I handle. This led to a conversation where I asked if he could start helping out around the house in general. I explained that I’m the only one who does the daily cleaning and laundry, and that we’d have more time on weekends to relax if he helped a bit during the week.

His response was, “No, if you got up when I do and managed your time better, you could get these things done. You work from home, and there’s no reason you can’t get them done because you’re home all day.” He pointed out that I don’t help with bigger projects, so he doesn’t feel he should help with smaller ones. I told him that mowing the lawn every other week is very different from daily chores, but he wouldn’t budge.

I’ve been feeling frustrated about this conversation for weeks. When I mentioned it to a friend, she shrugged and said it seemed fair, but something doesn’t sit right with me. Am I wrong to think that just because I work from home, it doesn’t mean I should be responsible for almost all of the household chores?

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

All the Methods,"What’s the Best Way to Store [Magic Mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/)? All the Methods. Had a successful shrooms harvest from your [magic mushroom grow kit](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/)? You probably won’t use them all right away, so what’s the best way to store them? We’ve gathered the smartest storage methods for you. From fresh to dried, in honey or chocolate, to [magic mushroom](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) tinctures and capsules. Whether you want to store them for a few days or a few years, there are plenty of options!

# How to Store Fresh Magic Mushrooms?

If you want to keep them fresh, the refrigerator is your best friend. Store your fresh mushrooms in an airtight container to maintain their quality. They typically remain fresh for about 7 to 10 days, depending on the temperature and humidity in your fridge. But be careful: if it’s too humid, they can spoil quickly. For longer storage, consider other methods like drying or preserving them in honey.

# Dried [Magic Mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/): For Long-Term Storage

Looking to store them long-term? Then drying is the solution. Spread the mushrooms out on paper towels in a dry place that’s not too cool but also not too warm. Make sure to turn them regularly and check for mold. After a few weeks, they’ll be properly dried, and you can store them for up to a year in an airtight container. Some people put the dried mushrooms in vacuum-sealed bags and store them in the fridge to extend their preservation even further.

If you have a food dehydrator, this is also an excellent option for drying magic mushrooms. Dry them at a low temperature to prevent loss of active compounds. Whatever drying method you choose, ensure they become completely dry – this prevents spoilage and ensures long-term preservation.

Dried mushrooms retain virtually all their potency and are particularly useful for later use. This is the most reliable method for long-term storage.

# Storing Magic Mushrooms in Honey

Looking for something different? Store your mushrooms in honey! It might sound unusual, but it’s remarkably effective. The active compounds in the mushrooms are preserved even longer thanks to honey’s natural preservation properties. Just ensure the mushrooms are completely dry before adding them to the honey, or you risk mold growth. An added benefit is that it significantly improves their taste.

# Storing Magic Mushrooms in Chocolate

Another delicious way to consume mushrooms and an effective method for longer storage is [making your own magic mushroom chocolate](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/product/magic-mushroom-chocolate-bar/). To make mushroom chocolate, melt chocolate and add finely ground dried mushrooms. Pour the mixture into molds and let it cool. Click here for complete instructions!  
  
The chocolate protects the mushrooms’ active compounds from light and air, helping preserve them better. In the fridge, mushroom chocolates can maintain their potency for a year or even longer. One benefit of making mushroom chocolate is that you barely taste the mushrooms while the effects remain fully intact.

# How Long Can I Store Dried Magic Mushrooms?

Dried mushrooms can last quite a while, depending on your storage method. In an airtight container, they typically maintain their potency for six to twelve months. If you opt for sealed vacuum bags, you can extend the shelf life of dried mushrooms to over eighteen months. In chocolate, they’ll retain their strength for a year or longer, while in honey they can stay potent for more than 18 months.

# Magic Mushroom Drops: A Practical Storage Method?

[Magic mushroom ](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/)drops are somewhat controversial, but if you want to store mushrooms long-term while having a convenient way to dose them, homemade psilocybin drops can be an excellent choice. This method extracts the active compounds from the mushrooms into a liquid, such as alcohol. This not only simplifies dosing but also extends the preservation of the active compounds.

Alcohol-based magic mushroom tinctures can maintain their potency for up to 1 year or longer when stored properly in a dark, cool place. It’s recommended to make tinctures yourself, as some vendors sometimes add substances you’d rather avoid (like synthetic 4-HO-MET or 4-ACO-DMT). Additionally, it’s essential to dose magic mushroom drops carefully.

# How to Make Your Own Magic Mushroom Tincture

To make your own magic mushroom drops, start by grinding dried mushrooms into a powder. Place the powder in a dark glass bottle and add strong alcohol, such as 96% ethanol, to extract the active compounds. Let this mixture sit for 1 to 2 weeks in a cool, dark place, shaking the bottle daily. Then strain the mixture through a coffee filter to remove the solid material. You now have your own psilocybin drops, ready for use!

# Processing Dried Mushrooms into Powder and Storing in Capsules

Dried mushrooms can be easily ground into powder using a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle. This powder can then be used to fill [capsules](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/product/one-up-psilocybin-capsules/), providing a convenient (and discreet) way to store & dose mushrooms. Store the filled capsules in an airtight bag in a cool, dark place. They’ll retain their potency for months this way, and you’ll always have an accurate dose on hand without having to taste the mushrooms. Tip: use a [scale](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/product/golden-teacher-mushroom-spores/) to fill each capsule with the same amount of powder. This ensures precise dosing.

# Why Freezing Often Disappoints

You may be thinking of freezing your freshly harvested shrooms for storage, but this is is usually not recommended. The main drawback of freezing is that it damages the mushrooms’ structure and reduces the potency of the active compounds. When thawed, they’ve already lost some of their potency, and their compromised texture makes them unappealing to consume. For fresh mushrooms, refrigeration is optimal, and for long-term storage, drying or preserving them dried in honey, chocolate, tinctures, or capsules are the most reliable options.

Some people make mushroom tea or [truffle tea](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/product/magic-truffles-dragons-dynamite/) and freeze it, but the exact shelf life is difficult to predict. Additionally, there’s uncertainty about the effect of freezing on the potency of the active compounds. While you’ll find success stories on forums from people using this method, consider it an experimental option.

# Experimenting with Fermentation

For those feeling experimental, there’s another option: fermentation. Similar to making kimchi or sauerkraut, you can ferment mushrooms too. Some enthusiasts claim it even enhances the mushrooms’ potency. However, this method requires caution. If the fermentation process goes wrong, you’ll need to discard your harvest, and consumption could lead to illness. If you’re interested in experimenting with this method, thorough research is essential.

# Drying Magic Truffles

You can also dry [magic truffles](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/product/strawberry-dream-magic-mushroom-gummies/) for extended storage. Follow the same instructions as for drying mushrooms. The process can take several days to weeks, depending on humidity. Once dried, magic truffles can maintain their potency for months in an airtight container.

# Fresh vs Dried: Which is Better?

A key difference between fresh and dried mushrooms lies in their potency. Fresh mushrooms contain more psilocin, resulting in a faster-onset and potentially more intense experience. During the drying process, some psilocin is lost, making dried mushrooms feel slightly less ‘direct’. However, dried mushrooms contain more psilocybin, which your body converts back into psilocin, ultimately providing a comparable experience. The primary distinction is in how quickly and intensely the effects begin. Both forms can be equally potent, though the experience may differ. Want to know more? Read our blog [Magic Mushrooms: Dried vs. Fresh – Which is Best?](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/mdma-therapy-hits-a-roadblock-whats-next-for-psychedelic-medicine/)

Additionally, factors like [set and setting](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/mdma-therapy-hits-a-roadblock-whats-next-for-psychedelic-medicine/), how much you’ve eaten, and the quality of the mushrooms all play crucial roles in your experience.

# Conclusion

Whether you choose fresh, dried, capsules, magic mushroom tinctures, or chocolate, what matters most is finding the method that suits your needs and preferences. Fresh mushrooms might provide a slightly faster and more intense experience, but dried mushrooms offer convenient long-term storage options. The choice is yours. Whatever method you select, treat the mushrooms with respect and [always prepare thoroughly for your experience](https://mywayusa.shop/).

The scariest was when I was going around a bend in a one lane road and my hands almost dropped from the steering wheel as another car came from the other direction.

1. I have read a few self-help books in the last few months and am really looking forward to improving myself both physically and mentally.
2. I have started to exercise regularly. Last Sunday I ran a 15km for the second time.
3. I spend more time doing things I like: learning languages, playing board games, watching the Simpsons and Taskmaster, eating ice cream, cooking, reading, taking care of my plants...
4. I am getting more productive at work. I am often the first one to arrive in the morning (I used to be the second-to-last), get a coffee and romp on full-steam.
5. I have lost a considerable amount of weight (\~10kg) in a healthy way. I have been at this weight before but it was due to not eating enough while still drinking a lot. However, this time it feels unbelievably healthy.
6. Someone said to me the other day that my face is starting to have a 'glow' to it and someone else said that I did not look so tired anymore.
7. I am having a bit of a difficult time coming to terms with the whirlwind of all the emotions that I had been suppressing with drink. However, it is nice to feel human again.
8. I feel more confident in myself. I voice my opinion more during conversations. I crack more jokes. I wear things I would not wear when I was drinking because I somehow did not feel worthy of them.
9. I have a lot more stamina and do not feel tired all the time.
10. I have become more...empathetic? I feel like I can think more about others and their problems now that I am not always foggy-headed or bogged down with my own problems.

Of course, it has not always been easy and I do not expect it to be so in the future. However, life, with all its ups and downs, is much more manageable (and dare I say enjoyable) sober. It is surreal how I almost feel like a different person now. Last but not the least, during moments of near-collapse, reading your experiences has strengthened my resolve to stay sober.

She would walk steadily towards a mission.

BUT my surgeon said I could drive to my 1 week post op appointment if I felt comfortable enough to do so. So my question is, when did you drive for the first time after surgery?

I haven’t even tried yet, and I’m nervous to…but I’m itching to get out. I’m the only driver in the house, and I’m used to getting my coffee every morning. So being cooped up and only walking where I need to go is kinda driving me crazy already. My coffee place isn’t in walking distance and they don’t deliver (no grub hub or DoorDash). Otherwise, I’d suck it up and walk there. I’m not looking to drive all over the place, just to my appointment and to get a coffee…maybe the dispensary if I do well with a short trip. That’s about it though. I can walk to the post office to pay my rent, other bills get paid online, and I can have groceries delivered.

Please don’t come at me about not doing this or that. I’m fully aware of what I can and cannot do otherwise, and I don’t need strangers online attacking me for asking a question. I’m just curious what your experience has been, so I can use that to make an informed decision for myself ✌🏼",0,1730292755.0,TopSurgery,5,0.5,False

Day 1; 

I'm about to take my very first dose. I've never been medicated for depression or anxiety before. 

I am 22 years old. 

Dose: 10 MG capsule by mouth once daily 

Currently I am feeling: 
anxious, scared (yes they're different), depressed, sad, angry?, restless, weepy

Currently I'm thinking:
 I don't want to take it. this could be a whole new life. what if I have bad side effects. what if it doesn't help. what if it makes it worse. what if I do get better and I'm a completely different person. what if it makes me do something bad. This medication is going to take away all of the things that make me happy (coffee, alcohol, and weed)

Currently the time is: 
7:50 AM 

Final thoughts: 
I really hope this works. This is my last effort. I'm so tired. 💔

1gflp7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gflp7u/he_lives_amongst_you/,He lives amongst you,"A shadow was cast over us. A silent shriek that haunted history since we first took breath. While our ancestors feared the predators luring in the dark, they missed the monster hiding amongst them. He has no origin. He has no soul to call his own. His only reason to persevere is to feast on our suffering. Or so I was told.

Throughout the recorded history only a few noticed his presence. I would have never learned of this foul beast if it hadn’t been for my father, who taught me once I was old enough. A family secret passed down the generations, bound to an oath to avenge the fallen. I wish my father would have taken the truth to the grave.

At first, I believed him to be mad; the beast was nothing but a ghost of his tormented mind. But the evidence he showed me convinced me of the opposite. In many human catastrophes, countless blood baths, or killings of innocence, he had his hands in. From the dawn of our species to now.

The writings my father revealed to me seemed a crude joke at first. But the more he amassed on me, the more my mind struggled to deny the truth. Once I saw the pictures, my skepticism died. A shade striving through human filth. Every step he took sent waves throughout the place he had infiltrated.

Sometimes he orchestrated entire uprisings that could only end in blood with only crows reigning supreme over the graveyard he had filled. Though more often than I would like to believe, all he needed to do was a minute action. Nothing but a little push to cause a ripple that would summon a tsunami. 

An unfortunate accident of someone important or the right words whispered into the ears of a future terrorist. Despite my extensive studies of the beast, I can’t tell how he knows who or what to influence to bring his wanted outcome. Perhaps he can see the future or all the different potential futures. Perhaps he is just guessing, and only his successful attempts have been documented. His failures would remain unknown to us. If there are any.

As to what I believe, I think the beast can glimpse into the human heart. It can decipher what we carry in our chest, hidden even from ourselves. With this information, the beast can play every human to a degree where it appears to be mind control. His capabilities are more akin to rewriting fate; as if he put us all on a determined path that would bring nothing but destruction.

This, at least, is what my father, my family, and every other doomed soul believed about him. To explain further, dear reader, you have to indulge me. Before unmasking the beast, I have to describe what brought me to the point of writing it all down so other people could learn of this thing. Then you will understand.

As I said, my father opened my eyes to the harsh truth when I was an adult. But even before that, I could tell something was wrong with my father. He always appeared to be preoccupied. As if something was haunting his mind. Father never cared for any of my interests or me in particular. Me and mother were nothing but noise irritating his important work. I asked Mother a few times why Father behaved in such a way. She knew about the beast, but I can’t tell when Father explained it to her.

“You will see, Jonathan,” she used to say. “Soon you will see.”

The only time Father invested his precious time into me was due to my education. Anything besides the best wasn’t good enough. Father never raised his voice against me or hit me, but he punished me with silence. His eyes were always cold, but when I couldn’t meet his high expectations, they gained a certain loathing for me. Before his disinterest would originate from a genuine lack of care, now it would arise from disdain. Only when I redeemed myself did he cease.

Praise was a rare occurrence but when it came, I held on to it like a thirsting man to water, using up every bit of it in my fruitless attempt to satiate myself. Mother was much the same. It might sound cruel, but I don’t think of her as a person. She served more as an extension to my father. She never spoke about the time before she met him. The way she acted you would think there was no such time. I don’t know what she saw in him to cast aside her identity and any hope for a loving husband in favor of my father who appeared to have lost all interest in her once I was born.

The only reason to be intimate with her was to create me. Nothing had any sentimental value in the eyes of my father. It was nothing but a means to an end. My mother to birth an heir, and me to carry on the family oath. An oath inherited from father to son for lord knows how long. My family history is not something I enjoyed to study. It is filled with tragedy and agony; much brought on by my ancestors themselves in their obsessed drive to hunt the beast.

I can only speculate how my grandfather treated my father, but by his hostile demeanor, it couldn’t have been better than my upbringing. Worse by the way he screamed in his sleep. Whatever it was, Father never dared to speak it out loud, but it influenced his every action and instilled him with the drive to end this generational-spanning pursuit. I shared this desire to end it all, as the thought of putting a child of mine through the same training I went through filled me with dread.

Every waking hour was focused on strengthening my body and honing my mind. I had to endure several harsh years of combat training and study concerning the beast. All for increasing my chance to not just survive an encounter with him but to also defeat him. Despite my father’s many shortcomings, he knew his craft and how to pass on his knowledge and skill to the next generation.

In these years I learned to hate my father in earnest. Before that, I was afraid of his judgment and yearned for his approval. But after receiving his complete attention, I came to understand that my father’s opinion shouldn’t be something to be taken into consideration. But I stayed. I stayed by my father’s side and did everything he told me to do.

After just a year, I had all the expertise to flee his grasp and survive on my own. Then why didn’t I? Easy, he had a point. The beast had to die. The fallen deserved to be avenged. And while my father was someone that I didn’t owe anything to, he was my best chance in eliminating the beast.

I think it was during the fourth year of my training that my father either thought I was prepared enough, or he couldn’t wait any longer. He was possessed by the wish to be the one who defeats the beast and puts an end to his secret reign. Gathering all the intel we had on the beasts, collected over countless decades by my family, we crafted our plan.

Based on all we had on the beast, we could narrow down his current location and identity. The beast wasn’t just a master manipulator but also a genius actor. How many different characters he made up over his long existence to blend into human society is impossible to tell. Tricking such a being should appear to be impossible, but my father and I noticed something.

Hidden underneath all the evidence of the beast’s existence and his deeds, there was a pattern. He was unstable. Despite all the knowledge and cunning he had, he often committed grievous mistakes, which seemed to pile up over the years. Did he lose his caution, as no one had been able to stop him yet? Or was something else occurring?

At this point in time, we couldn’t say, but we knew for certain that the beast wasn’t perfect. Take my family for example. As I have already mentioned, many of my ancestors didn’t enjoy a long life. Dedicating yourself to a war against the devil himself didn’t just promise a constant threat to your physical health but also to your psyche. While the beast laid waste to several members of my bloodline, many more couldn’t handle the truth and looming shadow of the adversary, taking solace in drugs or alcohol. Or mere severe measurements.

Why then didn’t the beast end my family? Why take the risk of anyone coming for you; no matter how slight the chances of one’s own loss? The answer is the beast tried. He had tried to kill every single one of my ancestors but failed to do so. Multiple times he came close, but always one member of my family escaped. Why not turn the tables and hunt the hunter? Because for some reason, the beast couldn’t.

Furthermore, the beast showed periods of inactivity. While measuring his actions proved near impossible, as often his influence was too faint to notice, we were able to map his deeds. Similar to his incompetence, his level of downtime was increasing. Did he need to rest more the further he aged? Questions over questions and there was only one way to answer them all.

My father and I took a great risk by going after the beast with such lacking intel, but both of us were keen to end the hunt. It appeared we didn’t just inherit the responsibility to stop the beast but also the tiredness of an entire bloodline, fighting for far too long. So, after months of observation and stalking, we were able to find him.

With the difficult part done, we went for the near-impossible one. Catching him. You see, Father didn’t just want to assassinate the beast, he wanted to capture him. The family records show that the beast isn’t someone to be trifled with, but he doesn’t seem to be unkillable. Ageless yes, but not immortal. This being said this doesn’t mean he would die as easily as a human being would.

One of my ancestors for example shot the beast six times in the chest. The bullets drove him to death’s door, but he succeeded in escaping justice despite his injuries. This showed us that we couldn’t believe normal measures to be sufficient to accomplish the deed. But perhaps it would have been. We were certain the beast was weakened, so maybe a well-timed bullet to the head would have been all it needed.

But no, father wasn’t willing to take any more risks. So, we decided to capture him and to take our time ending him. To accomplish this, we started to poison him. Small doses at first, nothing that should alarm him. We wanted to test out whether it would numb him enough to seize him.

One of the training fields which I had to master was deception and disguise but fooling the fools’ lord was impossible. Once alarmed, the beast would vanish, and it would take decades to find him again. So, we couldn’t come into direct contact with him, but with the people around him.

The coffee shops the beast loved to visit, his workplace, and his favorite restaurant. The beast is a creature of habit, and we had his schedule mapped out. We knew when he wasn’t nearby, so we could infiltrate his surroundings to place our drugs and poisons. And within days, our plan proved itself successful.

The beast appeared sick, barely able to keep his eyes open. His workplace ordered him to stay put at home and only return once cured. Dear reader, you might question our strategy. How could a being such as the beast ever fall sick? Wouldn’t such a creature be immune against all mortal illnesses?

The short answer is no. The beast’s body had been ravaged by the plague three different times. This allowed some of my ancestors and other hunters to find and fight him. But no matter the infliction, he persevered, but he suffered, nonetheless. And, more importantly, he was afraid for his life.

The beast did as he was told and remained at his home. On the third day, he went out to do some shopping. He had no one in his life to do this for him, fitting for a being of his nature. This was when we ambushed him. My father lured him next to our van by asking for directions. I told you, dear reader, I fear that the beast can look into the human heart and read it like a book. He should have noticed our intentions immediately right away. At that point in time, I thought the sickness was hindering his observation skills. Furthermore, I thought the beast believed himself safe, having forgotten all his caution.

Father distracted him for a few moments, so I could sneak out of the van. It happened within moments. The beast described which direction my father should take to reach his destination as I flung my arm around his neck and injected him with a mixture of drugs strong enough to knock out a horse. He was struggling underneath my hold, and I noticed his inhuman strength. If he hadn’t been weakened before, he could free himself with ease. As the mixture began to spread, I dragged him into the van. Once I closed the door, he had lost consciousness.

We brought him to our home and locked him up in our basement. Our house was reinforced and prepared for a direct assault of the beast. But also, to keep it there if the opportunity should open itself up to us. We bound him to a chair with locks of steel inside a cage. There were no windows, and the only door could take a rocket blast. Just for good measure.

I don’t know how long we watched his unconscious body. The arch enemy of not just our family but our very species trapped in front of us. Quite the sight to behold. Or so it should have been. I knew the beast looked like a common man, but you expect to see something in him. Some minute detail he got wrong. Something that would mark him as the devil. But no, he looked like someone ordinary. A bit disappointing.

He stirred after a few hours. He took in his surroundings, and the realization of his situation dawned on him. The lord of fools could act like no one. He begged. He sobbed. Screams for help. The beast fought against his restraints, roaring to be freed. My chest tightened at his performance. If I had been a lesser man, I would have believed him.

Father wasn’t moved either. He took his seat in front of the beast and began his questioning. He wanted to learn more about him before killing him.

“What are you talking about, man?!” the beast cried. “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”

Every time the beast failed to answer, Father hit him. Strong from the beginning, but his punches lacked the ferocity I knew my father to be capable of. That changed within an hour. Blood littered the floor accompanied by several teeth. It was a difficult thing to watch. The never-ending cries and my father’s wrath.

“Show yourself, devil!” my father screamed. He seized the beast by his hair, wet with sweat and blood. “Your lies won’t convince anyone!”

The beast’s face was swollen. His eyes were shut, and his nose was broken several times; any resemblance of a human appearance was beaten out of his features. My father collapsed in his chair, panting. He had kept himself in peak condition. He could run any marathon with ease and his punches could crack a human skull with just one hit. That the beast had survived his barrage for hours by this point proved beyond a doubt that this wasn’t a man in front of me.

“Jonathan, do it,” Father said, wiping away the blood from his hands.

I took out the bag of tools we had prepared for this moment. I do not intend to describe what I did to the beast. My father took joy in his torment. That’s why I think we kept him for as long as possible. Not to learn anything, but to make him suffer. To force the devil to endure his own domain for once, share the fate of any poor sinner, doomed for eternity.

I didn’t enjoy it. Often, I had dreams of grandeur. Of me being the savior that would free humankind of their worst adversary. That I would make the beast experience true regret once I was finished with him. Reality was less spectacular. I tortured him. Every pain you could imagine, I drowned him in. Agony you couldn’t even begin to grasp. Even if you torment the devil himself, your hands will be soiled by sin that can’t be washed away. It shouldn’t. It should stick to you to remind yourself what you are capable of and willing to commit.

Three days. Three days the beast endured… no, three days I endured.

Up until this point, I had successfully disassociated myself from the situation and me. But as I was taking a break, cleaning myself, I started shaking. I couldn’t stand any more second in this.

“Just say it,” I said, turning towards the beast. “Just tell him what he wants to learn.”

The beast was covered in blood and wounds. I hadn’t left a single spot untouched. His flesh was burned, cut, crushed, and worse. How many bones I broke or limbs I destroyed, I don’t dare to ponder. His body was more composed of freshly made scars than anything else, burrowing deep, speaking of pain reaching down towards hell. Yet he hadn’t died.

The beast’s head hung low, twitching. He was muttering something to himself. I grabbed a knife for the chance he would try something and approached him. I had to step next to him to hear his weak whispers.

“I can’t…,” he said. “I can’t wake. Let me sleep. I can’t endure it…”

“Then confess!” I said. “Be truthful towards my father, and I promise your suffering will cease!”

The beast shook his head, tears falling. “It hurts… it hurts so much…”

Somehow, I knew he wasn’t speaking about the torture I put him through. “What do you mean? What is hurting you?”

“My head… it’s full. Please, I don’t want to wake…”

“What are you talking about, devil? Answer me?!”

“It hurts?!” the beast screamed. He jerked his head up, staring at me. I was startled, moving away from him. While his eyes had been shut swollen two days ago, his body had an unnatural capability to heal itself. Due to that, the swelling had receded, and I could see them. His right eye still had the light blue tone as when we captured him but not his left one. The iris was drenched in a dark that would devour you if you wouldn’t be careful with a hot crimson star in its midst. It burned. An inferno trapped inside his head, so intense it blinded me.

“It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!”

He didn’t stop screaming the same phrase again. He wanted to trash around, the bindings cutting into his flesh as they held him. He threw his head back, his chest rising and falling in violent interludes. Blood poured out of his left eye, red tears descending like a comet toward the ground. The look he gave me. No malice, no promise of revenge or carnage. Inside this trapped star of his, I saw no devil but a broken being, driven mad.

His wild stare pierced into me with the weight of too many lives. “Why did you wake me?! Why?!”

Like a savage monster, the beast rampaged against his chains. A rage born from something I couldn’t understand took hold of him. But neither my father nor me were the target of his ire. I think the world itself or perhaps something grander laid at the core of his wrath. Too big to seize or to rip apart. Without a direct perpetrator to take revenge against, the beast seemed to want to tear apart anything too close to it, blinded by his inner turmoil. Something needed to die to clench this lust of his.

Dear reader, I can’t begin to describe the dread filling my lungs with every breath I took, pushing out the air I would have needed. Standing in close approximation to the beast and his anger crippled my mind and body, forgetting how to perform the simplest of tasks. How do I move my legs? How do I blink? How do I breathe?

“It’s all your fault!” the beast spat at me. “All of you should go to hell! You should burn! All of you! Burn, you should! Burn!”

As his left eye turned towards me, I became the only thing it seemed to perceive in the whole world. Its inferno leaked out of it, and I swear, dear reader, I could feel the heat of it. It bit into me, threatening to burn away my flesh and soul alike. This little taste of it, of the agony that would await me, was all it took to make me run up the stairs and flee.

The next hours are nothing but a blur. I can recall taking my parents' car and driving until it had no fuel anymore. I left it abandoned on the street and made my way through a forest, dodging tree branches and other obstacles in my mad sprint. When I came to stop or why I don’t know.

All I remember was cowering against a massive rock, pushing my back into the moss growing on its surface. Like waking from a nightmare, I blinked at my surroundings, having to remind myself that whatever I thought to have gone through was over. That I was back in reality. Night was already on the rise, and I feared to have been lost in the forest. Thankfully, I hadn’t made it far into its green embrace and found my way out of it easily enough.

I walked all night, haunted by my own cowardice. Father would be infuriated. I would never hear the end of it. But this was nothing more than a passing thought. This cursed eye followed me like a wraith, digging its claws into my skull, refusing to let go. To find any refuge from its haunting presence, I replayed the strange rumblings of the beast. What had he meant?

I didn’t find an answer on my walk. My mind was in shambles. As the sun rose again, I had arrived at home, or what was left of it. At first glance, it didn’t seem of the ordinary. But once I noticed the bloody handprint on the open door, I knew what had happened. I stood there for a couple of minutes, licking over my dry lips.

Did I want to see my dead parents? Did I need to see their shredded corpses, their guts littered over the floor? I don’t know whether I ever truly loved my parents. Thinking of them in this regard appears alien to me. Why treat them in a way they never treated me? But as I stepped towards my old house, I could sense a tear making its way down my cheek. I felt relieved at its presence, living proof that I was still somewhat human.

It was the only one I shed for them. 

I won’t describe them to you. They deserve this much at least. Just let it be known, that they tried to fight.

The beast had broken free of his shackles probably shortly after I fled, ripped skin and flesh still sticking to the shattered steel. In a daze, I sat down in the very spot the beast had been trapped in. I didn’t care for the blood soiling my clothing. I had bigger things on my mind.

Did I feel hate for the beast? I can’t say for sure. The glimpse I received of him had disturbed my outlook on him. But, after pondering the last conversation I had with him, I came to understand who he really was. His fate.

And here we are, dear reader. We’ve reached the end of my story, but this little tale is not over yet. You might remember that I promised to unmask the beast. That is only partially true. You would be forgiven for calling me a liar. I didn’t do so with ill intent. Everything I ever committed, I ever partook in, was only for the betterment of humanity.

I believed killing the beast a great service to my species, one that would remain unknown to them all, who yet couldn’t live without my deeds. I wasn’t wrong, but my goals have somewhat shifted. And the reason for that is you, dear reader.

One of you is not who they believe they are. You are not a bad person. You didn’t choose to be born like that. I thought you were a devil. Perhaps you were once. I can’t say. But what I can say is that I think I understand your turmoil. No, his turmoil.

No mind was made to endure eternity. The weight of his memories is crushing him, aren’t they? When I had woken him, I had woken him to them. Had he really fed on our suffering, or had he lashed out against anything that had taken him out of his slumber?

Is that why he had manipulated? Why he had pushed for destruction, as it was the only act of revenge he’d had for this cruel world that had birthed him? I won’t forgive him. I don’t think anyone can. My speculations shouldn’t be misunderstood as me trying to absolve him of his sins. They are his crimes, but not yours. You are a victim, unknowingly at that. But he is the same. A victim, too, but also a perpetrator. A broken child and a savage beast.  

Dear reader, I know you are not aware of the true nature of your being. You are nothing more than a pleasant dream. A dream of normality. An ordinary life, free of the curse of eternity. But every dream will come to an end. The beast will lash out again, and I can’t let this happen. Too many people have died. This needs to end.

You might wonder, how I found you? How do I know you will be amongst the few to read these very lines? The answer is simple. I finally understand you. The reason my family and the others all had failed is because none had attempted to comprehend what they were hunting. The beast was never alone. You were always by his side, shielding him from his suffering. The beast had appeared unknowable. Something beyond human that we can’t ever truly predict. That only after decades of close reading we might hope to find his scent again.

But not me. Not anymore. Every step you take, every thought rushing through your mind, every tear you shed. Like an open book, you are to me now. You won’t see me coming. You won’t feel a thing. When you read this, you will think me either mad or this being nothing but a crude joke. And if you believe a single word I wrote, you won’t think yourself the beast. You will believe someone else to house the monster.

This is good. You will die convinced being human. This grace I will grant you. Why am I writing these words then? Why am I announcing my coming? It is not for my desire to tell my story or to warn you but for the beast inside. Despite being asleep, I believe him to be watching. To hear what you hear through a veil, a faint echo he can perceive.

I want him to know his suffering will end. And to you, dear reader, I am sorry. Sorry that it had to be you. May we all meet under a brighter sun. Somewhere free of curses.

And now, dear reader, it is time to say goodbye. For now.",2,1730292490.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1gflp0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1gflp0l/have_you_ever_asked_yourself_who_am_i/,Have you ever asked yourself - who am I? ,"Anna had always been “the good girl.” She was raised to believe that her purpose was clear, her path already laid out. From as young as she could remember, she knew exactly what was expected of her. She attended every meeting, studied intently, and participated actively. She was known for her devotion, and her family praised her for her strength and unwavering commitment.

But as the years passed, Anna started to feel something unsettling inside her. She could never quite put her finger on it, but it was like a quiet whisper in the back of her mind, a feeling that grew with each passing year. When she tried to identify it, she felt a wave of guilt wash over her. How could she, of all people, be feeling this way? She pushed it down, buried it deeper, thinking it was just her lack of faith or her imperfection, hoping it would go away.

But it didn’t. In fact, it grew louder.

One evening, after a particularly long and emotionally heavy meeting, Anna came home and sat by her window. She watched the moonrise, its soft light illuminating the darkness around her. As she sat there, she allowed herself, for the first time, to truly listen to that whisper.

It told her something that frightened her, yet felt familiar: She didn’t know who she was.

The Unanswered Questions

Anna had always been told who she was, what she believed, and how she should live. She had built her life on a foundation of teachings and routines, but now, as she sat by the window, she realized that she had never been allowed to ask certain questions. Questions like, “What do I truly want?” or “What makes me happy?”

For the first time, she felt the weight of years spent without the space to discover herself.

Memories flooded back, especially of times when she had felt different emotions – not guilt, not fear, but a strange, quiet joy. She remembered the first time she read a book outside of her regular study, a novel her cousin had loaned her. She had been captivated by the world within its pages, a place where people had complex lives, and where good and bad often intertwined. She remembered how she felt reading that story and realizing that her own life was, in many ways, just one story among countless others. But she had been told to leave that world of books behind; they were “unnecessary,” distractions from her true purpose. So, she had let them go.

She also remembered times she had wanted to explore her own interests, her own passions. She had dreamed of painting, of traveling, of seeing the world beyond the confines of her town. But each time she felt those dreams rise within her, she had been reminded of her role. Each time she began to ask herself who she was, the answer had already been provided: she was a servant, she was a student, she was someone who needed to stay on the narrow path.

In that moment by the window, she realized how often she had been given answers before she even knew the question.

A Meeting with an Old Friend

A few days later, Anna ran into her old school friend, Sarah. They hadn’t spoken in years, but Sarah greeted her warmly, and they decided to have coffee together.

As they talked, Sarah shared her life’s journey – the choices she had made, the struggles she had faced, and the joy she had found in unexpected places. Sarah spoke of her love for painting, her travels to unfamiliar countries, and her process of discovering who she was and what she believed.

Anna felt a pang in her heart. It wasn’t jealousy, but rather a sense of longing. Here was someone who had taken the time to learn, to explore, and to grow into her own person. And Anna realized that she didn’t have stories like Sarah’s because she had never allowed herself the freedom to live them.

At one point, Sarah looked at her with kindness and said, “You know, Anna, I don’t think life is about having all the right answers. I think it’s about having the courage to ask questions.”

That night, as Anna lay in bed, those words echoed in her mind. She wondered what questions she had never dared to ask, what answers she might discover if only she allowed herself to search.

The First Step Toward Self-Discovery

The next day, Anna decided to do something she had never done before. She took a notebook and pen, sat outside, and began to write down questions that came to mind. She wrote, “Who am I? What do I want? What would make me feel at peace? What are my dreams?” The questions felt strange, almost forbidden, but she felt a weight lift from her shoulders with each one.

In the days that followed, Anna continued to explore these questions. She began to understand that the feeling of emptiness she had experienced wasn’t because she was broken, but because she had never allowed herself to be whole. She had been living in a box built for her, one that made it impossible to explore beyond its walls.

Through this process, Anna realized that, while her upbringing had given her many valuable things, it had also limited her. It had given her answers, but not the freedom to ask her own questions. She had been encouraged to follow a path but discouraged from carving out her own.

For the first time, Anna felt a glimmer of peace, of hope. She began to see that perhaps life wasn’t about having everything figured out. Maybe it was about walking her own path, with all its twists, turns, and unknowns. And maybe that was okay.

The Journey Forward

In time, Anna began to reclaim parts of herself she had forgotten. She took up painting, just as she had dreamed. She reached out to new people, made connections beyond her familiar circle. She learned to listen to herself and trust her own voice. She found that the world was not as black and white as she had once believed; it was full of color, of mystery, of stories waiting to be lived.

Anna still didn’t have all the answers, but that was no longer frightening. She had found something more precious: the courage to ask, the freedom to grow, and the quiet strength to be true to herself.

To Anyone Reading This:

If you have ever felt like Anna, you’re not alone. Many people feel lost or empty when their identity has been defined by others. If there is a whisper inside you – a quiet voice asking you to look deeper, to question, to discover who you really are – consider listening to it. It might just be the beginning of your own journey toward self-discovery.

It’s okay to ask questions. It’s okay to have doubts. It’s okay to not have all the answers.

You are more than a servant, more than a publisher. You are a person with thoughts, dreams, and potential. You deserve to know who you are, and that discovery is a journey that only you can take.",9,1730292473.0,exjw,2,0.91,False

Every day before school I drank iced coffee and now at 22 I’ve been drinking it daily sometimes I’ll have two medium iced coffees in a day. In all honestly it doesn’t really wake me up super well but I’ve become so addicted to it every morning I wake up and crave an iced coffee. 

I’ve never been lactose intolerant and no one in my family is either. I get my iced coffee with cream or milk and don’t have any issues. 

Until recently. About a month ago I started getting pretty shitty gas and bloaty after drinking my morning coffee. I get to work and I feel so bloated, gassy, and uncomfortable. When I skip breakfast it’s even worse and I’m running to the toilet to sh!t my brains out. 

I’m not sure why this randomly started happening. I’ve started to cut back to just one coffee a day but it’s still happening. I am also trying to get a meal in before my coffee or while I’m drinking it to help but I’m still getting bloated and gassy. 

I don’t think I’m lactose intolerant because I can eat all other dairy without issue (cream cheese, whole yogurt, milk, etc). I know that coffee naturally makes you shit but it’s never been this bad and I’m not sure why.

We were in different classes in junior year, so we didn't really see each other that often, but we had some overlapping friend groups  and we always knew about each other. In tenth grade we were in the same class, in that same year we both got first team for our respective sports (which the school made a huge deal out of) my sport being field hockey and hers being Netball. Because of this we would always go to school hosted events together (we were both the youngest in our teams, since its really rare to get into first team being as young as we were) where all the first team members would wear our school uniforms, representing the school etc. We ended up spending most of our time together at these events because the older players were not very fond of us, since we were younger and they thought we probably didn't deserve to be there because of it. We had a lot of fun together at these events though and grew much closer. Maybe it was a trauma bond or something lol.

Later on in eleventh grade, we became even more close. I would invite her to our family farm and spend entire weekends with her, I grew close with her brother (25M) and father (the mom is sort of out of the picture) They would all frequently visit my family on the farm, even her dads girlfriends (I think about 3 different women in total throughout highschool)

We would hang out in school, after school and by the end of eleventh grade we were great friends! Senior year came around and her family would often come to the farm, I would stay over at her place, we went to parties together, we were truly best friends at this point! In March of 2020 (our final high school year) her brother and I started to see each other more intimately, nothing too serious but he was definitely my first ever crush. He would come over to the farm (which she was always invited to as well) and all three of us continued hanging out together anyways, she was very supportive of this! Her brother and I's relationship was short lived anyways as I ended things like 2 months later. Still though, no bad blood between any of us, we were all still hanging out! It was covid during this time so I would mostly just invite them to the farm so they could escape the city for a bit (covid wasn't really a big issue in our country, but we were still in lockdown, though being on the farm really didn't feel like lockdown at all, we were always outside and so on. My friends were begging me to go to the farm just to get away from being cooped up at home)

Later that year when the restrictions were somewhat lifted and we went back to school she had begun seeing a guy in the same year as us. We all know him well and they ended up getting engaged 3 years later! (hence why I'm writing this) so she got a boyfriend and her 18th birthday rolls around, where her brother and I started things up again. We became a lil squad after that, doing double dates, going out on weekends together, it was so much fun! Later on her brother then ended things with me as I was leaving the country for university and he wasn't up for long distance (his previous relationship ended bc of it, so we ended it before it could really begin) I should add that after all this, there was STILL NO BAD BLOOD BETWEEN ANY OF US

Anyways, after matriculating high school we went to different universities and lost contact a little bit. I would come back during the holidays and invite all of them (her, her brother and her boyfriend) to the farm as we've always done through the years. Her brother always visited, but she never ever did, she was always with her boyfriend (now fiancé) going somewhere else. I never thought too much of it and her brother and I would have a great time on the farm anyways (platonically) even though I saw her brother more than her it wasn't because I wasn't reaching out. I invited her for coffee or lunch at places whenever I was in town and tried keeping contact, like wishing her happy birthday and checking in sporadically through the years. We didn't see each other much though, but would still meet up when bigger friend groups were also involved. When we would text it was like old times, very friendly and trying to make plans to see each other, i never got the feeling that there was a problem or anything between us.

Anyways, December 2023 came and she and her high school sweetheart got engaged, I was so happy for them! She is the sweetest person, words can't describe it, but she is literally the color yellow for me. Just always happy and artsy and a ray of sunshine. She is set to get married in a month from now (end of November 2024) and I really thought I would be invited to the wedding! We were really close all through high school and although we lost contact a bit, I thought we were good friends still...

  
I guess my question is: would I be the AH if i messaged her and asked why I wasn't invited? I feel really hurt, I don't what I could've done to upset her or if I even DID upset her? 

If anyone was wondering about the brother, he actually got engaged in May this year! I haven't met his fiancé but she looks like the sweetest girl. I haven't heard from him since his engagement, but I don't think we have any bad vibes between us either, we only ever kissed so I can't imagine that I'd be an issue? It was in high school anyway?

So, should I ask her about it? If yes, what would the best way be?

1gflcv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDwarf/comments/1gflcv8/follow_on_question/,Follow on question.......,"TL:DR. How are holograms projected as current.

When new crew come onboard, they are taken to the hologram suite and have ""their personalities recorded for storage in the hologram library"".

Hypothetically, a newly recruited third technician might work up to second technician, first technician, then passes the exams, become an officer, work their way up up up the ziguart of command, finally achieving the rank of captain.

Now then, captain is sadly killed by an angry honey  badger that has escaped from the petting zoo.

If the hologramatic database is never updated then every JMC holographic crew member is a fresh recruit with no additional skills or experiences.

So after that rambling preamble, here is my question.

Do the holographic storage models get updated regularly, maybe annually, or even with every promotion a new upload is done

OR, as we have seen, Holly is able to manipulate the physical characteristics of a hologram, can he/she update the emotional, personality and other psychological aspects of the subject to update on the fly as it were?

OR BIT 2, are we looking at a combination of the two, regular updates coupled with an estimated approximation of the essence that is the subject?

I know a holographic projection is a possible or probable approximations of the crew members, but to do that, Holly must have access to every single thought and actions that they have between the last upload and time of regeneration, is that an invasion of the crew's privacy?

I love cats a lot, my mom used to have a cat and I spend all my childhood with her, I’d said that cat helped me getting by those days. But raising one made me realize I’m terrible as a parent.
My breaking point was just my cat made so many messes that I couldn’t keep up cleaning after him. He knocked down the coffee cup I left on my table alongside my laptop. It spilled everywhere, into the carpet and on my laptop. I was so frustrated and angry at him, I got even more angry when he got scared and ran away when I screamed at him. I started crying and keep screaming at him while trying to clean up the mess, I feel so defeated and angry at myself too knowing he doesn’t understand anything. I called my friend and asked them to keep my cat for me that day. 
I’ve been feeling guilty since then, I know it’s mostly my fault for leaving the coffee just out on the table like that.

So I just wanted to know if anyone else had the some problem?
I'm trying ro quit vaping and it actually seems much harder than when I quit actual cigarettes. I was a heavy smoker for 7 years then I quit for 3 years but I started to vape again after because something really stressful happened. I was vaping for about 2 years but in the last 6 months I was vaping much more like constantly hitting the vape.
So now I actually decided to quit vaping I started to use nicotine patches and only hit my vape in the morning for my coffee so I would say I reduced my vaping a lot but the withdrawal symptoms starting ro freak me out. I actually don't crave vaping other than with my coffee. So I'm on my first week quitting kinda and I have these symptoms 

-Chest feels kind of tight and uncomfortable like when you have an anxiety or panic attack
-It's harder to breath and I'm kind of have short breath problems
- I feel kind of dizzy doesn't matter if I'm standing or lying down like my eyes can't concentrate on one thing and when I close my eyes it feels like I'm falling
Like not constantly dizzy but it comes and goes and makes me stressed
- constantly sleepy like I feel I could sleep all day and feel like I don't have any energy to do anything else
-feels like my hands and legs are kind of weak 
- heart palpitations kind of?

So I'm stressing out because when I first quit smoking I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms to be honest.
And these ones are scaring me I actually feel like I'm on the edge of a panic attack all the time.

Should I offer to pay more often or does that just make it awkward? And what about financial situations?

I take 54mg daily;
On days I do not take it i feel like a zombie, extremely tired. Even after a couple coffees with espresso shots, and will drink 2 energy drinks on days I miss it, I feel so tired and drained.

What does everyone else experience?

I'm worried wondering if I'll ever be able to function without taking it.

But sometimes while taking it, I still am.not very productive, however I'm always busy. How does that even make sense?",1,1730290660.0,Concerta,3,1.0,False

Send me your rates (yung cheap lang please huhu i’m baroque) or I can buy you coffee after?

'1-Cup' and '2-Cup' flashing...,"Im having a problem with my Bambino espresso machine since this morning. If I try to do a 1-cup or 2-cup coffee, it will start but after a few seconds both '1-Cup' and '2-Cup' buttons start flashing and it stop making the coffee. Same happens If I try with steam and hot water buttons.

Now, from the video, I tried to run the descale process on the unit to check if the unit was asking for a maintenance. Both '1-Cup' and '2-Cup' buttons start flashing even when getting into the descale mode. Now, the unit keeps flashing the '2-Cup' button.

I tried doing a factory reset and disconnecting it for a few minutes, but it keeps in the same state.

Any ideas whats going on?

I'm usually the one to invite and pay, but this time she insisted she wanted to invite and pay for my dinner.

We set the date and time for the following week. She texts me as it got closer and said she actually has work that day and asked if we could reschedule. Understandable given her job, I say ok we can reschedule. She now gives a new date on the weekend when she's free.

The night before she messaged me again saying she's really tired and needs a rest day and again asks if we can reschedule. I honestly found this excuse somewhat weird because we're just grabbing dinner and I also thought it was inconsiderate to cancel very late the night before. I told her it's kinda inconsiderate of my time to cancel that late when I turned down other invites to be with her. She apologized again and said she will message me when she's free. I just told her to just get some rest of she's really that tired.

She called me the following morning saying I can join her for afternoon coffee. I declined saying I already made plans for the day after she cancelled on me. She then said ""oh, can I ask what you're doing?"" In surprised/disappointed tone. I told her me and my coworker were planning on finishing our project.

My coworker happens to be female and for some reason I feel like my crush was jealous I was hanging out with her one on one instead. The previous day we also met one on one to work on our project. I think my crush was aware of this because I posted it on my Instagram story. I noticed around the time we were supposed to grab dinner my crush posted an old photo of us together. I found it a bit strange because she normally doesn't post our photos together.

I get a texts later from my crush saying we can grab dinner on Monday, but she will let me know what time she gets off of work and she was really sorry she keeps cancelling on me. I didn't have my hopes high but I said ok.

Monday came and I didn't get a text or call from her. I messaged her around 4pm asking if we're still grabbing dinner. Her response was ""were we supposed to?"" with an immediate follow up of ""oh you're right! I am so sorry!"" I told her we don't have to go if she doesn't want to, but don't keep making plans if she's not intending on following thorough with them. She apologized again and said she's been on her period and having really bad cramps so she has been resting at home. I told her sorry to hear that and hope she feels better soon.

We did eventually reschedule for later that week and she showed up and paid. My question is more on her seeming disappointed when I made other arrangements when I cancelled. Was it because I was meeting with another girl that she seemed that way, or was it because she thought I was just going to wait around and have no plans because she cancelled?

Any insight is much appreciated!",0,1730290340.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,0.33,False
