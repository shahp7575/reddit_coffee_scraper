1n5n4ly,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5n4ly,"Ê≤ôÊ∫™ Shaxi: The ancient town that refused to become ""another Lijiang"" - here's how they did it differently","Several friends had recommended Ê≤ôÊ∫™ Shaxi to me over the years. This ancient town, about a 2-hour drive from Â§ßÁêÜ Dali, was described to me as something like a hidden paradise.

When I finally made the trip myself, they weren't exaggerating. Shaxi feels like it's been preserved behind some kind of time barrier. The streets, buildings, and stone pathways all maintain their traditional style, but it's not that weathered, crumbling kind of historic feel you sometimes get. Instead, there's this fresh sense of history, like time decided to slow way down here a few hundred years ago and never quite sped back up.

I looked into it later and learned this is thanks to a restoration project from about 20 years ago. The funding came from Swiss institutions, and the main architect was ÈªÑÂç∞Ê≠¶ Huang Yinwu. His philosophy for heritage restoration was ""maximum preservation, minimum intervention"" - basically respecting local cultural traditions and building techniques rather than just making things look artificially old. You can see this in how buildings like ÂÖ¥ÊïôÂØ∫ Xingjiao Temple, the theater stage, and ÂçóÂØ®Èó® Nanzhai Gate were extensively restored or even rebuilt, but somehow they don't feel out of place at all.

The whole project was slow and restrained. During my few days in Shaxi, I kept hearing locals say one thing: ""We don't want to become another Lijiang.""

There's something about this place that puts you into ""Shaxi time"" - you naturally slow down, get absorbed in whatever you're doing. I found myself putting my phone away and just focusing on eating lunch properly, not thinking about afternoon plans or messages I needed to reply to. Just choosing, chewing, swallowing. After eating, I'd wander down to the river by the ancient town, stand by the water, and just soak in this incredible sense of calm.

Shaxi has attracted quite a few outsiders who've opened businesses here, so in this seemingly isolated little town, you'll find several coffee shops, Western restaurants, bakeries, burger joints, and Japanese restaurants. It caters to that refined middle-class taste, which makes it pretty different from your typical ancient town. Maybe that's unfortunate in some ways, but some people seem to like this blend of preserving tradition while staying connected to modern life.

Even though a popular TV drama ""Meet Yourself"" in 2023 brought more attention to the place, I think it's managed to keep its unique quiet atmosphere. Definitely worth experiencing for yourself if you get the chance.",2,1756729038.0,travelchina,0,1.0,False

Basically, my daughter (7) starts back at school tomorrow. I have 50/50 custody (weekly rotations). I have asked everyone I trust if they can pick her up from school during my weeks, as my husband drop her off on his way to work. The school refuses to help because I don‚Äôt live in their district and I even asked her dad who of course he said no (typical behaviour from him, but I digress).

On the roof are 4x 390 watt solar panels which feed a 3kw inverter through a victron smart system to 4 150amp agm batteries.
If we are in the marina obviously everything is fine but put on the cut to use our coffee machine (1950w) or quick boil kettle we have to start the engine otherwise the inverter has a hissy fit and beeps warning that it‚Äôs not happy when off grid the cooling fan on the inverter seems to come on a lot. The solar and inverter and batteries were fitted in 2021 the previous owners were CC rs for 2 years. 
Our current marina costs ¬£3800 per year + electric so may think of moving out after winter.
Questions.
Would it be possible to fit a 4kw inverter on the current system?
Would it be better investing in a good generator EG Honda or Hyundai? 
If I get a genny can it be fitted into the engine bay? We have a euro cruiser stern so plenty of room below.
Has anyone any recommendations for settings on the smart charging system?

1n5mxjx,https://i.redd.it/73gs43dlnjmf1.png,How doable is EV travel in the UK? Without DC charging!,"So ChatGPT already put together a suggested travel plan: but I'm more stressed out about charging. It seems charging infrastructure has a lot to wish for in the UK. For example in Harwich I see two AC chargers, and I'm lacking information if I can actually charge there. Or that it's off limits.

Perfect! With **4 days from Harwich** you can cover a lot more ground without stressing about the range. Since you‚Äôll have your Nissan Leaf (max \~250 km per charge), it‚Äôs smart to plan a **loop itinerary** with good charging stops and overnight stays. Here‚Äôs a balanced 4-day suggestion:

---

## üöó Suggested 4-Day Loop

### **Day 1 ‚Äì Harwich ‚Üí Suffolk Coast**

* **Dedham Vale (Constable Country, \~20 km)** for a walk/coffee in an idyllic English village.
* Continue up to the **Suffolk coast (Southwold, Aldeburgh, or Orford Ness, \~80‚Äì100 km)**.

  * Southwold = classic seaside town with a pier & beach huts.
  * Aldeburgh = music festival heritage, pebble beach, great fish & chips.
  * Orford = medieval castle + nature reserve.
* Overnight along the Suffolk coast.
  üîå Many seaside hotels now have chargers.

---

### **Day 2 ‚Äì Suffolk ‚Üí Norwich & Norfolk Broads**

* Drive to **Norwich (\~70‚Äì100 km)**.

  * Norwich Cathedral, castle, cobbled lanes, independent shops.
* Spend afternoon on the **Norfolk Broads (boat tour at Wroxham or Ranworth, \~15 km)**.
* Overnight near Norwich or on the Broads.

---

### **Day 3 ‚Äì Norwich ‚Üí Cambridge (via Ely)**

* Head south-west to **Ely (\~110 km)**.

  * Visit the spectacular Ely Cathedral (‚Äúthe Ship of the Fens‚Äù).
* Continue to **Cambridge (\~30 km)**.

  * Walk through the colleges, punt on the River Cam, lots of history.
* Overnight in Cambridge.
  üîå Plenty of chargers at hotels and park & ride sites.

---

### **Day 4 ‚Äì Cambridge ‚Üí Colchester ‚Üí Harwich**

* Morning in Cambridge if you want more time.
* Drive back via **Colchester (\~90 km)**, England‚Äôs oldest town with Roman walls and Norman castle.
* Short hop back to **Harwich (\~30 km)** for the ferry.

---

## üåø Alternative themes

* **More countryside/coast:** Skip Norwich and spend extra time in Suffolk villages (Lavenham, Long Melford, Framlingham) and Dedham Vale.
* **More city/culture:** Add a London side trip (park at Epping or Stratford, take train in) instead of Norwich.
* **Nature:** Spend more time in **Thetford Forest** and the Norfolk Broads.

---

## ‚ö° EV Tips

* Use **Zap-Map** or **ABRP (A Better Routeplanner)** for charger planning.
* Gridserve hubs on A14 & A11 make Cambridge‚ÄìNorwich very EV-friendly.
* Destination charging (hotel/inn chargers) will make the trip smoother.",0,1756728444.0,TravelUK,1,0.5,False

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

my friend who regularly buys premium beans has a Moccamaster batch brewer, and an entry level Wilfa Svart grinder that she is a bit reluctant to upgrade to something more decent.

\- Sub 100‚Ç¨

\- Sub 250‚Ç¨

\- Sub 500‚Ç¨

# Detailed timeline:

10xx ‚Äì Long before the invasion of the territory that is now Brazil by Portuguese explorers, there was an evil spirit ravaging the Para√≠ba Valley region, known as Xind√© Perru√°n, the black dog, or wolf. It presents itself as a huge maned wolf with black fur, seemingly made of shadows. This spirit seduces and manipulates its victims with promises of prosperity and long life, but at the same time it generates and feeds on the greed and wickedness of those who allow themselves to be corrupted, infecting the living and controlling the dead. The fact is that at some point in this past, a shaman from a tribe tasked by the gods with protecting the region from supernatural dangers, imprisons the spirit in a jequitib√° sapling and seals it in a cave high on a hill.

1828 ‚Äì Centuries later, young Martim Vaz Guimar√£es would come across the cave. Xind√©, very weak, would gradually begin to tempt him and over the next twenty years would ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the young man become rich and prosperous.

1848 ‚Äì The spirit would finally convince Martim to remove the sapling from the cave and plant the jequitib√° tree. Martim then began the process of purchasing the land surrounding the cave and transforming it into a coffee farm, hoping to control the spirit and become even richer, believing he had made a pact with the devil.

1850 ‚Äì Martim purchased the property and began building the farm, planting the jequitib√° tree right behind where the chapel would be located, hoping that the proximity to ‚Äúsacred ground‚Äù would make the spirit easier to control. Xind√© was not at all affected by this, but pretended to be, to more easily manipulate the farmer. He then names the farm ""G√°I√°√¥,"" meaning ""my offering"".

1853 ‚Äì G√°I√°√¥ coffee production begins, quickly becoming highly regarded and famous, even abroad.

1869 ‚Äì With the death of his wife, Martim officially leaves leadership of the farm to his only son, Itamar, but unofficially, he remains the owner and decision-maker.

1908 ‚Äì Xind√© convinces Martim to sacrifice Itamar at the foot of the jequitib√° tree in exchange for more life and power. The farmer kills his son and makes it look like an accident. That same year, Lucio Fabiano, Martim's grandson and Itamar's eldest son, took over the farm, just like his father.

1914 ‚Äì Under the influence of the spirit, Lucio ""discovers"" the existence of Xind√©, who pretends to be Martim's prisoner and tells a version of everything that has happened up until this point, but blames everything, especially Itamar's murder, on Martim. With this, the spirit plants the idea in Lucio that the only way he can truly take over the family and replace Martim is if he kills the farmer and buries him at the foot of the Jequitib√° tree. Lucio then poisons Martim and buries him there. In the following years, Lucio follows in his grandfather's footsteps, but instructs his son, named after Martim, as Martim Lucio, to deflect suspicions, about the existence and abilities he believes Xind√© possesses.

1916 ‚Äì Ademar, Lucio's brother, leaves the farm and heads to the northeast.

1942 ‚Äì Martim Lucio falls into the same temptation as his father and murders him, hoping to control the farm and the spirit and become more powerful. But Xind√©, after more than a century of using the family to gain strength, finds himself uninterested in ""helping him,"" mainly because he imagines that Martim Lucio's despair and remorse will be stronger. Besides, the spirit is tired of being trapped and wants to be free from the tree, but doesn't know how. The farm begins to decline, production and profits are decreasing.

1958 ‚Äì Martim Lucio approaches the spirit, offering his daughter's life in exchange for a new pact, unaware that this doesn't matter to the spirit. Xind√© pretends to accept the pact, but refuses to allow the man to kill the young woman, claiming to have other plans for her. First, knowing this would fill Martim Lucio with even more anguish and regret, and second, because it is bound to the tree and its surroundings, the spirit plans to infect the girl with some of its essence and use it to exert further influence. So, one afternoon, in the coffee fields, the spirit attacks the girl. At first, the girl, Maria In√°cia, appears very ill, but quickly recovers. In the following years, she becomes a kind of vampire, a night terror, attacking the farmworkers and feeding on them and her own father.

1966 ‚Äì Unable to bear the guilt and anxiety, Martim Lucio reopens the cave beneath one of the bathrooms in the farmhouse, locks his daughter there, and commits suicide. This also traps part of Xind√©'s essence, causing its influence to diminish again to only the Jequitib√° region. In the following years, the farm is auctioned off, and its lands are divided and sold, but it falls into disuse, forgotten over time, becoming just another of the countless ruins of old farms in the region.

2021 ‚Äì Matias Arlindo, a descendant of Ademar, acquires the farmland in the hopes of renovating the farmhouse and chapel to their former glory. While the construction company is demolishing the ruins of the old house, they reopen the cave, freeing the girl and the essence of Xind√© that resides within her. She attacks the workers, impeding construction progress. And, as the supernatural is stronger due to the human absence during the pandemic, Xind√© returns much stronger than before.

Parallel to this, Mariana, a descendant of the tribe of the shaman who imprisoned the spirit. She is trying to keep her tribe's mission alive, dealing with and working with the supernatural. But she is only one person, and she seeks others to help her, thus bringing other characters into the story, like Jeferson, including the Players' characters.

2 months ago - Mr. Matias finally acquired the entire land of the old G√°I√°√¥ farm, his family's legacy.

2 weeks ago - The first group of contractors was sent to the farm's main house, where construction began.

11 days ago - The group of contractors stopped returning contact.

10 days ago - Mr. Matias sent one of his assistants, along with a bodyguard, to the site, but they also did not return.

9 days ago - Not wanting to involve the police, Mr. Matias sent a group of five gunmen to the site. Only two returned, one alive and traumatized, claiming the dead and white smoke had attacked them, or the other in a zombie state. The car had several dents, scratches, and two bullet holes.

8 days ago - J√∫lio, the gunman who returned alive, was treated and placed in an inn. Marcelo, the one who returned as a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù, was tied up and taken to a warehouse that had been set up as a makeshift medical station, and Dr. Oliveira was contacted to evaluate him.

7 days ago - Through Dr. Oliveira, Mr. Matias learned about Mariana and contacted her. She contacts Jeferson, saying it's time to put her idea into practice. So Jeferson calls the Player Characters and asks them to meet at the bar to make the job offer.

Two days ago - Mr. Matias arrives in Resende and signs the contract with Mariana.

Every ""best cities for expats"" list puts Barcelona at #1, and it's complete bullshit.

Here's why Valencia destroys Barcelona in every metric that actually matters:

# üí∞ THE COST REALITY CHECK

**Rent (1BR apartment, decent area):**

* Barcelona: ‚Ç¨1,200-1,800/month
* Valencia: ‚Ç¨700-1,100/month

Just last month, I moved a tech worker from Barcelona to Valencia. Same job (remote), same lifestyle. He saves ‚Ç¨800/month now. That's ‚Ç¨9,600 per year just on rent.

**Daily expenses:**

* Coffee in Barcelona: ‚Ç¨3-4 (tourist tax)
* Coffee in Valencia: ‚Ç¨1.50-2 (actual local price)
* Dinner for two: Barcelona ‚Ç¨60-80, Valencia ‚Ç¨35-50

Do the math. Barcelona isn't expensive because it's better. It's expensive because it's overhyped.

# üìã BUREAUCRACY NIGHTMARE

**NIE processing times (real data from my cases):**

* Barcelona: 45-60 days average
* Valencia: 15-25 days average

I've personally sat in Barcelona immigration offices with clients. It's hell on earth. Overcrowded, understaffed, and the staff treat you like you're bothering them by existing.

Valencia offices? It's like a different country. Organized, efficient, and they actually help you.

# üèñÔ∏è THE TOURIST TRAP PROBLEM

Try this: go to Barcelona and find a quiet beach, a non-touristy restaurant, or a neighborhood where locals actually live affordably.

I'll wait.

Barcelona sold its soul to tourism. You're not living in Spain ‚Äì you're living in Spanish Disneyland. Overpriced, overcrowded, and designed for people who leave after a week.

Valencia has actual beaches (not sardine cans), real neighborhoods, and Spanish people who don't immediately assume you're a tourist.

# üë• THE EXPAT COMMUNITY TOXICITY

Check the Barcelona expat Facebook groups. It's 90% people complaining about:

* Pickpockets
* Rent prices
* Crowds
* Noise
* How ""locals are rude""

Valencia expat groups? People actually help each other. They share apartments, organize events, and create real community.

Barcelona attracts bitter digital nomads who think they're entitled to cheap paradise. Valencia attracts people who want to actually live in Spain.

# üöá TRANSPORTATION REALITY

Barcelona metro: Packed like sardines, frequent delays, pickpockets hunting tourists

Valencia metro + tram: Clean, efficient, and you can actually breathe

I've seen clients get robbed on Barcelona metro three times. Valencia? Zero.

# üè¢ THE JOB MARKET LIE

""But Barcelona has more opportunities!""

For what? Serving sangria to drunk British tourists?

If you're remote, location doesn't matter. If you need local work, Valencia's startup scene is exploding without the Barcelona ego and cost.

# üåä QUALITY OF LIFE

Barcelona: Stressed locals, tourist-hunter landlords, overpriced everything, crowds 24/7

Valencia: Relaxed pace, reasonable costs, actual Spanish culture, space to breathe

I've had clients cry from relief after moving from Barcelona to Valencia. Not joking.

# THE BOTTOM LINE

Barcelona isn't #1 for expats. It's #1 for people who want to say they live in Barcelona.

If you want to actually LIVE in Spain (not perform Spanish life for Instagram), Valencia wins every time.

I don‚Äôt remember what the judge said. Something about irreconcilable differences and the best interest of the children. All I heard was the gavel and the silence after. My marriage was over. My daughter was gone. What stuck with me wasn‚Äôt the words, but the look my ex gave me across that table‚Äîa look of relief. And Emily‚Ä¶ my little girl‚Ä¶ she clung to her mother‚Äôs hand, wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. Like she already knew the truth: I wasn‚Äôt worth looking at.

I went home. The house felt hollow. No toys in the corner, no crayons scattered on the table, no cartoons rattling the walls. Just silence‚Äîand the half-empty bottle of Jack waiting where I‚Äôd left it that morning by the kitchen sink. I drank until my head hummed. Until the silence pressed down on me like a weight. A familiar and comforting feeling.

That‚Äôs when I thought I heard it‚Äîtap, tap, tap. Slow. Measured. Like someone pacing with a cane down my hallway. I froze, bottle halfway to my lips. I waited. Listened. Nothing but the house creaking and the blood in my ears. Must be the drink, I told myself, dismissing it. Just the drink. Just an old house. I drank more until the weight in my mind blurred, until I was on the edge of passing out.

‚Äîand that‚Äôs when the TV came on.

My eyes snapped open. I hadn't touched the remote. I hadn‚Äôt even looked at the thing. I stared at the blank screen, trying to make sense of it. A momentary power surge? The cable? But as I watched, the screen flared, filling the room with bright colors and the squeaky jingle of a theme song I knew too well.

‚ÄúHiya, kids! It‚Äôs time for Uncle Smiley‚Äôs Playhouse!‚Äù

A cold dread replaced the whiskey's warmth. This was impossible. This was wrong. It was Emily‚Äôs favorite show. I used to scream at her to turn it off. And now here it was, playing in my empty house.

Onscreen, Uncle Smiley danced, his oversized bowtie bouncing. In one hand he swung a polished black cane, twirling it and tapping it against the floor in rhythm with the music‚Äîtap, tap, tap. His head was too round, too shiny, his smile too wide. Behind him were the puppets: saggy Benny Bear, sharp little Freddie Fox, and floppy Ricky Rabbit. They clapped and hopped along. But the laughter track looped wrong‚Äîtoo high-pitched, warbling, like children choking on their giggles.

Smiley stopped dancing. He leaned toward the camera. Toward me.

‚ÄúWell, well, well! Look who‚Äôs watching all by himself! Where‚Äôs your little princess, huh? Where‚Äôs Emily?‚Äù

My throat went dry. My mind reeled. How could it know? It was just a TV show. A recorded show. I stumbled to my feet. ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù I muttered, my voice shaky.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be shy, Daddy. We know why she‚Äôs not here. She doesn‚Äôt want to see you anymore! Isn‚Äôt that right, kids?‚Äù

Benny Bear‚Äôs big head bobbed. Freddie Fox‚Äôs button eyes rattled. Ricky Rabbit bounced. Disbelief warred with a gut-wrenching terror. I grabbed the remote, mashed the power button. Nothing. I tried the volume, the channel, anything. Nothing. My mind screamed for a rational explanation. A neighbor's prank? A hack? I yanked the plug from the wall. The screen stayed lit, humming with a defiant glow.

Smiley‚Äôs voice boomed from the speakers: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt turn us off, Daddy. The fun‚Äôs only just begun!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so silly!‚Äù Ricky Rabbit laughed hysterically.

The puppets lurched closer to the camera, their movements jerky, twitching like broken marionettes. Their button eyes gleamed wet, their stitched mouths twisting into something sharp. This was a nightmare. This couldn't be happening.

And then, one by one, they began to crawl out of the TV screen, the fabric of their bodies rippling as they emerged.

I watched, frozen in a state of sheer disbelief as Benny Bear‚Äôs head squeezed through the static, a raspy giggle spilling from his stitched mouth. Freddie Fox cut through the buzzing static like a knife. Ricky Rabbit flopped out last, his long ears dragging along the floor. Behind them, the screen went black. They were inside.

I ran into the kitchen as quick as my drunken legs could move. I could hear the shuffling scurrying sound coming after me. I crawled on all fours into the hallway.

Back in the kitchen I could hear presses opening, banging shut the sound of cutlery being rattled.

The sounds stopped and I turned around to be confronted with those tv animals.

‚ÄúHide and seek, Daddy!‚Äù Benny chirped, holding a razor sharp kitchen knife.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find you!‚Äù Ricky squealed. Tapping a hammer in its rabbit paws like he had seen too many mob movies.

‚ÄúWe always do,‚Äù Freddie whispered menacingly My nail gun in his tiny paws a battery strapped on his back.

‚ÄúRun‚Äù Ricky roared throwing the hammer at me, I ducked just in time as the hammer would have connected with my head had I not moved.

I stumbled backwards, smashing through the glass coffee table, shards of glass cutting my hands. The pain starting to sober me up.

The puppets scattered, wrecking the house as they went. The hammer smashed picture frames. Knives scraped along the walls. Freddie pulled the trigger on the nailgun, pop-pop-pop! Nails spat into the drywall, whining as they buried themselves.

I ran. Limped into the bedroom. Slammed the door. Locked it. My chest heaved. My heart felt like it was clawing through my ribs.

Scrambling for the bathroom en suite, I figured I could try to get out the window I closed and locked the door behind me.I stood on the toilet my hands dripping with blood. I lost my footing, hand prints smeared the glass as I went down hard, my right shoulder smashing into the bath tub. Sitting with my back against the wall I heaved to catch my breath.

Then the bathroom door shuddered. I pulled myself back up. A nail ripped through the wood an inch from my face. Another. Then another. Freddie‚Äôs cackling rose on the other side. One nail buried itself into my leg. Hot, searing pain exploded as I collapsed against the wall, screaming. Another went straight into my chest.

‚ÄúGotcha! Gotcha!‚Äù Ricky‚Äôs voice sang from outside, muffled through the wood. I pressed my hand to the wound on my chest, with my blood slicked palms. I dragged myself backward, toward the bathtub, teeth gritted, sobs breaking through.

And then‚ÄîTap. Tap. Tap.

Slow. Measured. Coming down the hallway. Smiley‚Äôs cane.

Each tap was deliberate, patient. Closer with every beat. I realized then: it hadn‚Äôt been the whiskey earlier. I‚Äôd heard him. He‚Äôd already been here.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The lock shuddered. The hammer smashed again. The nails whined through wood. And over it all, Smiley‚Äôs voice drifted closer, warm and cruel, as the tap of his cane echoed outside the door:

Expert Guidance for Bahrain Company Formation and Intellectual Property\
\
Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals., you quickly realize how vital trade secret protection is for anyone planning Bahrain company formation.\
Surprisingly, many newcomers underestimate just how advanced Bahrain‚Äôs intellectual property (IP) protection regime actually is. The 2025 Forbes Business survey ranks Bahrain as the Gulf‚Äôs most welcoming hub for foreign SME innovation‚Äîwith new business registrations up 19% year-on-year. (Reuters 2025). This surge is thanks to streamlined regulations, 100% foreign ownership allowances, and tight trade secret measures.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs Business Landscape and the Value of Trade Secrets\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., driven by robust fintech, healthcare, and logistics expansion. Foreign direct investment is at record levels as global giants and agile startups choose Bahrain‚Äôs free zones and business-friendly structures.\
What‚Äôs fueling this boom? Foremost, it‚Äôs trust: companies know their IP‚Äîtrade secrets, proprietary software, customer lists‚Äîwill be protected under responsive, business-centric laws.\
\
‚ÄúBahrain‚Äôs legal infrastructure is modeled on global best practice yet tailored for local needs, offering real protection for company know-how.‚Äù\
‚ÄîMy own experience with Sijilat filings for two tech startups\
\
Economic Growth and Trade Secrets\
Bahrain Bay is home to over 100 new tech firms (2025 MOICT registry data), many relying on trade secrets for a competitive edge. In a region where relationships, timing, and reputation rule, confidential information is currency. This is especially true during Ramadan, when business hours shift‚Äîa subtle reminder that mastering local customs is as important as legal compliance.\
\
How Trade Secrets Are Protected under Bahrain Law\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. defines trade secrets as information:\
- Not generally known or readily accessible;\
- With commercial value due to its secrecy;\
- Subject to reasonable measures to maintain secrecy.\
This includes:\
* Formulas, processes, algorithms (classic in fintech and bio sectors)\
* Marketing plans, client lists, unpublished specs\
* Internal reports, pricing strategies\
Ownership: Both individuals and corporates can claim trade secrets. Foreign investors and expats enjoy identical protections under Bahrain‚Äôs IP regime‚Äîhardly the case in Saudi Arabia or UAE, where local sponsorship often muddies IP rights.\
Enforcement in Practice: Civil & Criminal Liability\
Bahrain‚Äôs judiciary (notably Civil Courts, and, since 2024, a new Economic Court branch in the Seef District) enforces trade secret rights vigorously. Remedies available:\
- Injunctions (immediate stop orders, usually within 7 days)\
- Compensatory damages (often upward of BHD 20,000 for serious breaches)\
- Seizure of infringing products\
- Criminal prosecution‚ÄîIf malicious intent is proven, penalties can exceed BHD 5,000 and up to 2 years‚Äô imprisonment\
But timing is everything. File too late, and recovery gets difficult, especially if an ex-employee has jumped ship to a competitor in the Diplomatic Area. (Once, I missed the optimal complaint window and spent months negotiating out of court.)\
Compliance and Contractual Measures\
Successful companies combine statutory protection with:\
- Ironclad NDAs (often bilingual, English and Arabic for local enforceability)\
- Employee handbooks spelling out confidentiality obligations\
- Restricted access to sensitive files (cloud and physical)\
- MOICT-approved IP audits (recommended annually)\
- Professional bookkeeping to track and document trade secret value\
Pro tip from the field: Always notarize NDAs at the Manama Notary Public office on a Tuesday before noon. The queue is manageable, and the coffee at the nearby caf√© is strong.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Practical Steps to Safeguard Trade Secrets\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. and B.S.C. (Bahrain Shareholding Company) for most IP-heavy businesses\
- S.P.C. (Single Person Company) for solo founders\
- Branch and Representative Offices for global firms\
- Free zones for tax-exempt IP development\
See full entity comparisons here.\
Insider tip: W.L.L. setups in Bahrain Bay or Seef District gain faster Sijilat processing‚Äîoften under 7 business days, thanks to digitalized MOICT workflows.\
Step 2: Register and Document Your Trade Secrets\
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù trade secret registration. Instead, implement a multi-layered approach:\
- Draft and translate all confidentiality documents up front (English/Arabic)\
- Archive digital versions with timestamps and witness signatures on secured servers‚ÄîTamkeen‚Äôs support grants often reimburse software costs\
- Keep hard copies in a lockable file at your primary registered office (with lease notarized at the Land Registration Bureau near Government Avenue)\
- Maintain an ‚ÄúIP asset register‚Äù submitted annually to the MOICT for audit readiness\
I once cut application processing time by 30% by preparing all trade secret documentation in advance and using Tamkeen‚Äôs digital stamp system‚Äîsaved me hours of back-and-forth at Sijilat.\
Step 3: Onboard Employees and Partners‚ÄîThe Right Way\
\
All employment contracts must contain confidentiality clauses compliant with Law No. 6/2014.\
During onboarding (typically a majlis-style orientation), explain the why behind trade secrets‚Äîthis is not just paperwork, it‚Äôs company survival.\
Provide annual refresher training (in Ramadan, offer post-iftar sessions for maximum attendance)\
Use professional interpreters if you‚Äôre hiring non-Arabic speakers‚Äîin my experience, this prevents costly misunderstandings.\
\
Step 4: Monitoring and Enforcement\
\
Install access-control systems (physical and digital)\
Routinely check audit trails\
If you suspect a breach, file a complaint within 30 days at the MOICT building (opposite Bahrain World Trade Center)\
Engage a specialist IP lawyer‚Äîseveral are based in Bahrain Financial Harbour with English-speaking teams\
\
\
Cost Considerations for Trade Secret Protection\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.: BHD 350‚Äì800 for bilingual documents via reputable Manama law firms\
- Company Formation Fees: BHD 250‚Äì750+ for Sijilat registration depending on structure (full breakdown here)\
- MOICT Annual Audit Filing: BHD 100‚Äì200 (waivable if you join Tamkeen‚Äôs compliance support program)\
- IT Security Systems: BHD 500+ for basic encrypted cloud storage (Tamkeen grants can reduce this to near-zero for startups)\
- IP Litigation/Enforcement:** From BHD 2,000 if action escalates to court\
And don‚Äôt forget: Bahraini professional fees are typically 30-40% lower than Dubai or Riyadh, offering better ROI for SMEs.\
\
2025 Regulatory Update: What Entrepreneurs Must Know\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
- Stricter cross-border transfer rules‚Äîall disclosures to non-GCC entities require MOICT pre-approval\
- Immediate 24-hour injunctions for trade secret breaches, speeding court protection\
This brings Bahrain‚Äôs regime in line with EU and US standards, according to Forbes Business 2025 analysis. Companies that ignore these updates face fines (BHD 2,500+) and possible license suspension.\
\
Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi Arabia: Is Bahrain Better for Trade Secrets?\
Here‚Äôs the bottom line: Bahrain offers faster, more transparent trade secret enforcement than its GCC peers.\
\
No forced local partner for most sectors‚Äîsee 100% foreign ownership sectors and 99% ownership rules\
Smoother Sijilat process‚Äîfully online, less paperwork than in Abu Dhabi or Riyadh\
More predictable court timelines\
Lower legal and compliance costs\
\
I recall one multinational client who relocated their IP-sensitive R&D unit from Dubai to Bahrain Bay after losing a confidential customer list in the UAE due to lax enforcement. Bahrain‚Äôs legal remedies restored their trust‚Äîand their competitive advantage.\
\
Insider Tips for Streamlining Your Trade Secret Strategy\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.\
- Pre-certify digital NDAs with Tamkeen‚Äôs e-signature tool\
- Leverage professional services for compliance and audit-saving tips\
Money-saving tips:\
- Tap Tamkeen and EDB support grants for legal, IT, and training expenses\
- Choose office locations near Sijilat or MOICT to cut travel time\
- Opt for free zones if your IP strategy requires relaxed repatriation rules\
Common mistake? Over-relying on oral agreements‚Äîespecially after late-night majlis deals (I‚Äôve seen four businesses unravel due to handshake-only NDAs). Bahrain law requires written contracts for enforceability‚Äîalways.\
And one tangent: The way Bahraini coffee is served in board meetings‚Äîsmall cups, right hand only‚Äîis more than ceremony. It‚Äôs a sign you‚Äôre invited ‚Äúinside.‚Äù Similarly, treat your trade secrets as a privilege shared only with trusted insiders, never outsiders.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. Do I need to register my trade secret with a government agency in Bahrain?\
No formal registration exists. Legal protection depends on showing you‚Äôve taken active steps to safeguard the secret, such as NDAs, restrictive access, and proper documentation. Explore Bahrain company formation process.\
2. What is the best company structure in Bahrain to protect intellectual property?\
A W.L.L. (With Limited Liability) or B.S.C. company gives the strongest IP protection for most sectors. Entities in Bahrain free zones also enjoy tax and repatriation benefits.\
3. How much does it cost to start a business in Bahrain with strong IP protection?\
Budget BHD 2,000‚Äì5,000 for setup, legal drafting, and compliance in the first year. Use this detailed cost guide for breakdowns.\
4. Can foreigners fully own companies and claim trade secret rights in Bahrain?\
Yes‚Äî100% foreign ownership is allowed in most key industries, with identical rights for IP protection.\
5. Who can help me with compliance and trade secret audits in Bahrain?\
Local firms like KeyLink and international legal consultancies in Bahrain Financial Harbour offer great packages for audit, compliance, and legal drafting.\

I wsa using a Baratza Encore before this and to be honest I never tasted the finer coffee notes. The coffee was good, sure, but there was never anything exceptional regardless of the beans. At one point I got these light roasted beans that the machine just could not grind fine enough (despite my calibrating it to the finest setting) and I figured it's time to upgrade. 

I have videos of my full workflow.

Setup:

- Espresso machine: Breville Bambino about 5 years old. Stock with nothing changed/upgraded.
- Grinder: DF64 Gen2
- [Basket](https://imsfiltri.com/prodotto/b62-52th26e/): IMS precision 20g filter basket B62.52TH26E
- [Tamper](https://www.normcorewares.com/products/normcore-spring-loaded-tamper-v4?variant=40267140104388): Normcore v4 Self-Leveling Spring Loaded tamper 53.3 at max resistance 53.3mm
- [WDT](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGKXQ2B4?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_sms_mwn_dp_AMHWJ7Z07YHE5H8YSQDP&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_sms_mwn_dp_AMHWJ7Z07YHE5H8YSQDP&titleSource=true&csmig=1&th=1): 0.4mm stainless steel 10-needle

[Beans](https://ironcladcoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-worka-sakaro-anaerobic-natural): Light roasted using the Anaerobic ""Wine Process"" Natural process. I got them 8/20.

Process:

1. Weigh out 18.2g beans and put in grinder.
2. Grind beans (blow bellow a bunch of times).
3. Place ground beans in basket and use WDT.
4. Tamp.
5. Measure coffee in portafilter, 18.1g
6. Place portafilter in machine, start extracting by holding both buttons (custom time extraction) until they blink and hitting the two shot button.
7. The bambino maxes out preinfusion time at 12s (can't do longer).
8. At 26 seconds, I hit stop (espresso keeps pouring)
9. At 28 seconds, the cup has 36g, I manually remove it.
10. Espresso keeps coming until 32s passed.

Final measurement: 36g espresso in 28g.

I have videos of the puck prep and extraction, and animage of the final shot. https://imgur.com/a/pdltb4V

Extraction: my assessment from the video is that there's heavy channeling. There's empty spots on the basket and there's spurts of coffee coming out throughout.

Tasting notes: the coffee is just always extremely acidic/sour. I can't taste any of the ""jasmine, strawberry,exquisite"" notes I'm supposed to feel. It's also watery with very little crema. 

I've tried a distribution tool, double tamping, grinding finer and coarser. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but when I hit ""stop"" on the machine the espresso doesn't stop flowing. Is that normal? 

Let me know if there's something else I should mention that I forgot to.

1n5mfur,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1n5mfur/some_things_that_helped_me_maybe_itll_help/,"Some things that helped me, maybe it'll help someone else.","Falling asleep can feel like a mind game, and I think it is. I have dealt with insomnia for a while now, but I've encountered a certain number of things that helped me. But first I think it's important to go over the basics, as without these, I don't think it would've worked. The first two will be obvious, but bear with me.

The Basics - 1. Cut out all stimulants.

I was using methylphenidate for my ADHD and quite frankly it aroused my nervous system and kept the door shut tight on sleep. There was a physical lock on that door and no amount of therapy was going to open it for me. I suggest cutting out things like coffee, or if you're also on stimulant medications, try looking for ways to change those. Keep in mind it takes months for your brain to catch up so be sure to stick to it and not throw away your progress if your sleep doesn't improve after a week or two

The Basics - 2. No blue light an hour before bed

You've heard this one before. No screens. Just treat your phone like it becomes radioactive after sundown, put away the laptop, turn off the PC unless it's for white noise. Give your brain an hour or so to calm down and become ready for bed. Sleep has to hatch from your brain sort of like an egg, and you have to brood it, every night, preferably following a set schedule. Give it darkness, give it oxygen through slow and deep breathing. Consistency is key. Make it a little ritual to turn off all screens, so just the act alone can prime your brain for bedtime.

With that out of the way, here's my technique that I haven't seen mentioned before. Make up nonsense words in your head.

Unlike the basics, this one's a little more abstract. When you're trying to sleep, sometimes thoughts can race; you think to yourself, you think about things, or imagine scenarios/stories. Your imagination takes over almost like your brain is creating entertainment for you out of boredom due to a lack of audiovisual input, and it does that by thinking about things, things you like, that you hate, that worry you, that please you. None of these are good. The trick is to neither think to yourself, think about things, or think of scenarios. Shut down an overactive, creative mind. The way I found to do that was not to punish these thoughts, or to try and focus instead, which also awakens the mind, but the opposite. Lower the walls and break the dams of focused thought and let your thoughts spill over and run rampant into an endless run-on string of nonsense which is about everything and nothing at once, like a mental white noise. Usually once that level is achieved, sleep follows almost immediately.

For me, the most effective way to achieve that, by far, is making up an endless stream of non-existent words that you can make up on the spot. Think of it like a form of babble, mad mumblings, or a series of magical incantations. As you lie down and close your eyes, and breathe deeply, give your mind a while to get ready for bed. Then recite to yourself, in your head, an endless sentence, a string of made up words. Let those words come to you, don't actively think of them and don't second-guess them, let them bubble up from your subconsciousness without planning ahead. Simply imagine tapping into to some foreign or even alien language you do not know, let it be generative, let it be meaningless, no previous sound or tone knows what comes after it, simply let it run like a river. Also try not to visualize it, as visualization can be arousing to the brain. Simply observe the words as they come to you, hear them in your head, and focus on them and your breathing. It can take a while to get this going, but once it does it's hard to stop, and soon your brain is rambling nonsense like a mad person. That's usually when sleep comes easiest to me.

Bonus: Change is good

If you're struggling for a long time, your brain can start recognizing your attempts to sleep, even your bed or bedroom, as a source of stress, which is the opposite of what you want. So, do things to trick your brain into not recognizing the situation by changing things up. You can do this primarily through your senses. Create a different sound, sight, smell in your room. Lie the other way around in your bed once in a while. Lie in a different room, lie on the couch. Put your mattress on the floor. All these things can prevent your brain from recognizing this as an attempt to sleep and setting off stress triggers. This can be deceptively effective at times.

There's my take, I hope it helps someone and I hope it's communicated well.",1,1756726940.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

On that trip we both shared our love experiences. Before leaving to go home he asked me if I was gay.

I think he guessed it from the fact that I said ""person"" instead of ""girl"",

He was very nice. I told him with an open heart about the person who had destroyed my feelings. Once I got home I received messages from him who kept apologizing to me because he thought he was too invasive, and he was afraid of offending me. I reassured him. He continued to worry about me about the situation with the boy I had told him about. He came to ask a friend of mine to talk to help me, saying that I was a good person and that I didn't deserve to be treated like that.

They had written ""maybe *name* is gay.

1n5mf2d,https://i.redd.it/q09xup5xijmf1.jpeg,"ATYR_Alpha: Celebrating 2,000 Members (and 200,000 Monthly Visits) - Reflections on Building a High-Conviction Research Community","Hi folks,

I want to pause and reflect on a significant milestone: we‚Äôve just crossed 2,000 members in the subreddit - 2,000 people, who, somehow, have become part of this process and journey. Honestly, when I started this, it was just a thought in the back of my mind. I never set out to build a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù - I just wanted to write the kind of research and analysis I always wished existed, and maybe have a few good chats along the way.

I‚Äôve been around markets and research forums for a long time - often just floating, sometimes contributing, always looking for depth and for answers you couldn‚Äôt get anywhere else. It was actually someone else‚Äôs comment - ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you start your own subreddit?‚Äù - that set this in motion. I thought, alright, maybe there‚Äôs something I can bring: a way of thinking that‚Äôs a bit more process-driven, a bit forensic, maybe a bit unorthodox, and definitely more focused on frameworks than on hype. So I just started posting (and posting, and posting and posting‚Ä¶.!)

I never expected it to get here. In just a few months, not only have we crossed 2,000 members, but we‚Äôve seen over 200,000 visits in the past 30 days alone. I get interpretations of subreddit analytics from people who know about this kind of thing, and apparently, r/ATYR_Alpha is the fastest-growing niche finance subreddit in the entire space - especially for something so specialized, so research-heavy, and so deliberately *not* meme-driven. Amazing, hey? We‚Äôre talking about long-form, detailed, and sometimes dense content, yet we‚Äôre pulling regular post views in the 20,000‚Äì35,000+ range. Engagement is off the charts. And the growth appears to be sticky - people come here and stay around.

Why? That‚Äôs the part I find most intriguing. I think it‚Äôs because what we‚Äôre doing here actually matters, and it‚Äôs different. From the start, I made a decision that this wouldn‚Äôt be about hype or signals. Rather, I wanted to build a toolkit for people - something that would make you sharper, more independent, and more able to challenge.

If you step back and look at what we‚Äôve done as a community, it‚Äôs actually pretty remarkable:

- We‚Äôve dissected management teams, tracked subtle leadership changes on LinkedIn, and looked for tells in their backgrounds and networks.
- We‚Äôve gone deep on patents - reading not just how many there are, but what they actually cover, and what that could mean for platform value or blocking competitors.
- The science is another level. I‚Äôve seen people here digging into published studies, pulling apart figures, challenging mechanisms, and putting a clinical lens over everything from molecular biology to patient impact.
- We‚Äôve mapped the entire history of every deal: partnerships, licensing, buyouts, and what it all says about company priorities and strategic options.
- The market mechanics here are a whole new toolkit - reading the options chain, understanding float, short interest, gamma exposure, the works. We‚Äôre not just looking at price - we‚Äôre analyzing the structure behind it.
- Social media and sentiment: we‚Äôve paid attention to it all. Not to get swept up in noise, but to read the temperature of the market, spot early shifts, and even catch authentic patient stories when they surface (a post on that today‚Ä¶.)
- Every earnings call, fireside chat, and conference appearance has been broken down - not just for content, but for delivery, body language, subtext, and, yes, the occasional ‚Äútell‚Äù from management.
- We‚Äôve watched short attacks come and go, and learned how the narrative can be weaponized, how the community can push back with facts, and how to recognize when something is real or just manufactured fear. 
- We even look at Google Trends, web analytics, and alternative data sets - whatever gives us an edge in understanding attention and narrative flow.
- Institutional activity? Every 13F and NPORT gets read, mapped, and discussed. Fund flows, ownership structure, and even index inclusion mechanics - all part of our research stack.
- And it‚Äôs definitely not just me. This community draws on your expertise: and I‚Äôve been contacted by clinicians, lawyers, techies, academic researchers, traders, former industry insiders, you name it (and a diverse range of others). The level of insight here is far beyond what you get in most places - and the fact that people are willing to not only read my posts, but share their findings, not just hoard it, is what makes this work even better.
- I‚Äôve made mistakes, too - chased down false leads, overestimated signals, but the community has still found ways to keep improving.

One thing I want to talk about - and something that really drives me - is this idea of **information asymmetry**. In most trades, especially in biotech or small caps, retail is often flying blind, left to guess and speculate, while the real moves are dictated by institutional mechanics, selective access to information, or pure market structure. Too often, retail is left with a coin flip - at the mercy of FOMO or fear, or just caught as a pawn in someone else‚Äôs chess game. I see this community as a genuine attempt to close that gap. The point of everything we do here is to *chip away at the information asymmetry* - to get under the hood, build context, ask better questions, and make the odds less like a random gamble and more like an educated, managed-risk decision.

That‚Äôs why I get so passionate about building and using new analysis techniques. When you put in the effort - go forensic, connect the dots, analyze the science, the market mechanics, the people, the options chain, all of it - you get smarter. You become more confident in your own thesis. You‚Äôre not a weak hand getting shaken out by noise, but someone who can stand their ground, whether you‚Äôre long or short or just looking for understanding. My whole goal here is to help you build your own perspective, find your own conviction, and never just take someone else‚Äôs word for it - including mine!

There‚Äôs a lot of satisfaction in seeing frameworks and models you‚Äôve developed actually being used by other people - adapted, improved, challenged. And I‚Äôm convinced that anyone, with the right resources and enough willingness to learn, can build these skills. You don‚Äôt need a PhD, a Wall Street job, or thousands for data terminals and newsletters. What you need is a process, an open mind, a willingness to work, and a community that will push you to get better.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so keen to focus on training and frameworks. My vision is to build out a set of modular, self-serve tools that anyone here can pick up and run with. I want to show that you can bootstrap this - you don‚Äôt need to spend a fortune. If you stick around and engage, you‚Äôll be able to develop the same kind of analytical approach. And the goal isn‚Äôt to turn everyone into a copy of me; it‚Äôs to give you the foundations so you can build your own style, bring your own strengths, and find your own edge.

I care a lot about this. I know I go on about process and frameworks, but I genuinely believe it matters. It‚Äôs not about the ticker, not really - it‚Äôs about learning to see through the noise, to challenge narratives, to question what you‚Äôre being told, and to develop conviction grounded in actual work. I think there‚Äôs a reason people stick around here: we‚Äôre building real confidence, not just hype.

Some quick context about me. I‚Äôve always had a bit of a different approach - analytical, a bit obsessive, probably a perfectionist, but also someone who likes to find new ways of thinking about old problems. To be honest, in traditional corporate settings, that wasn‚Äôt always appreciated. I was often told I was ‚Äútoo creative,‚Äù ‚Äútoo challenging,‚Äù or ‚Äúnot following the process‚Äù - a ‚Äúcowboy‚Äù, if you will. Sometimes I paid for that in performance reviews or bonuses, even when the net results were good. It took me a while to realize that the problem wasn‚Äôt the way I worked - it was the environment. And so I doubled down on what made me unique; on my strengths. What you see here is the result: I do things my way, and this community is proof that others want to do the same.

If you‚Äôve ever thought about contributing more - posting, commenting, DMing, challenging my take, or sharing your own research - please do. That‚Äôs how this gets even better. I really want to keep growing this community and to keep the culture strong: grounded, respectful, open, and focused on real learning. It‚Äôs a point of difference. After this catalyst, there will be new case studies, new tools, new frameworks, and hopefully a lot more people building up their own skillsets. Stick around!

And just a quick note on supporting me - what better occasion than this milestone to mention it? If you value the work here, or if you want to help ensure the community keeps growing and the research stays high quality, [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo) is the way to do it. For those who already have, thank you - genuinely. It literally covers a basic hourly rate for the time I spend here (I‚Äôm still working towards covering all the subscriptions, but we‚Äôre getting closer). I know I‚Äôm behind on thanking people individually, but I see it, and I appreciate it. If you haven‚Äôt given yet and you‚Äôre getting value, and want to see this continue - whether it‚Äôs a few dollars or more - please consider it. Every contribution is a vote of confidence and helps keep me motivated to put in the long hours, both for this catalyst and whatever comes next.

Nothing here is trading advice. It‚Äôs all about process, skill-building, and shifting the way we think about markets.

1n5ma1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n5ma1r/explore_the_nostalgia_retro_compact_microwave/,Explore the Nostalgia Retro Compact Microwave Review Is It Worth the Hype,"Vintage vibes caught my eye the moment I unpacked the Nostalgia Nostalgia Compact Countertop Microwave Oven 700-Watts with LED Digital Display-Child Lock-Easy Clean Interior-Lavender, 0.7 Cu. Ft. Retro lavender? Not your standard kitchen hue, yet somehow it felt like it belonged. I‚Äôve been testing it for weeks now‚Äîand while I‚Äôve got opinions (both glowing and, uh, frustrated), let‚Äôs get to it.

**Retro Charm in a Compact Size**  
Sitting at just 12.5‚Äù x 17.5‚Äù x 10‚Äù and weighing about 25 pounds, this microwave is designed for smaller spaces. It slid perfectly onto my countertop without hogging real estate. That lavender finish and the chrome accents gave off serious ‚Äò50s diner vibes‚Äîfriends kept asking, ‚ÄúIs this just for the aesthetic, or does it actually work?‚Äù Spoiler: it does work! The compact size makes it an ideal option for dorm rooms, apartments, or anyone with limited counter space. Yet some might still prefer a larger capacity.

**Cooking Power & Efficiency**  
With 700 watts, I could get by on heating frozen meals, coffee, and quick dinners like mac and cheese. It‚Äôs efficient enough for everyday heating, but when it came to cooking denser items like frozen chickens or large potatoes, the extra few minutes could test your patience. The rotating glass carousel was definitely effective at evenly heating my meals, though, saving my late-night leftovers from the dreaded cold center. So, it delivers performance-wise in line with its wattage, but it‚Äôs not breaking any land-speed records.

**User-Friendly Features**  
I‚Äôve rarely found microwaves with as much character combined with simplicity. The 12 pre-programmed settings, ranging from popcorn to baked potato, were surprisingly handy. There‚Äôs also a delay timer and express cooking mode. Adjusting the power levels became second nature, which is good since some foods insisted on precision heating. The LED digital display isn‚Äôt just easy to read‚Äîit actually looks cool, with its glowing retro fonts perfectly blending function and nostalgia.

**Highlights**  
- Stylish retro aesthetics with lavender and chrome.  
- Compact and lightweight for small countertops.  
- 12 pre-programmed cooking settings, convenient for quick meals.  
- Rotating glass carousel for even cooking.  

**Shortcomings**  
But perfection is rare. The main area for improvement here lies in power‚Äîit seems adequate for basic tasks but falters with anything too demanding (I‚Äôm looking at you, frozen pizzas). The retro knobs are gorgeous, but they can feel a bit fiddly compared to modern tactile buttons when you‚Äôre in a rush. The built-in child lock is a thoughtful touch, though I did hear myself grumble more than once trying to get it to work seamlessly on busy mornings.

- Limited 700-watt power means longer cooking times for big portions.  
- Retro knobs aren‚Äôt always as intuitive as digital buttons.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing to competitors like the Toshiba EM925A5A or the Panasonic NN-SN65KB, this lavender gem clearly leans on style as its differentiation. Both of those models can deliver higher wattage (900-1200) with more robust cooking power, making them faster for denser foods. On the other hand, neither brings the fun retro charm this microwave provides. If speed outpaces style for you, some of those alternatives might be a better match. However, for those prioritizing aesthetics in their compact kitchen arsenal, the Nostalgia option is tough to beat.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
What sealed the deal for me was its charm-to-cost ratio. It‚Äôs priced in a range that keeps it wallet-friendly yet functional. Sure, you could pay a bit more for power or fewer dollars on a plain microwave, but this one sits in the sweet spot of practical and quirky. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt just buying a kitchen tool‚ÄîI was adding personality to my space.

1n5m7w2,https://v.redd.it/kk1tyt1zgjmf1,Odd behavior?,"Hey! I'm kinda new to Reddit so I'm not sure what I'm doing but does anyone know what's going on with my dog? She's been yanking her body back, like trying to reach her tail.. But shes not biting it or anything. Just twirling her body over and over to I guess look at it. She's also been going under our coffee table in the livingroom, looking at the top of it and whimpering super loud. She isn't really whimpering like shes in pain though, it almost feels performitive. She keeps hitting herself into my bed backwards too, like how a bear itches it's back on a tree except she just pushes herself into my bed until I tell her to stop. She does it specifically where her tail connects to her body too.  

She's been doing this since I started school a few weeks ago, for reference, I'm 14F. I just started freshman year and I go to alternative school. 1230-345. I've tried to chop it down to just stress or anxiety because she's adjusting to not having me here all the time. I'm a homebody and I don't have many friends so I was sat at home all summer. 

She's a pocket bully, not sure how old she is. Ill have to ask my dad when he gets up. It's 7am right now and google said she could be in pain or anxious, but I don't know. She's not whimpering when she sits on her tail or anything, not biting or licking it, other then the table thing and the two others I really don't know. Maybe a bug bite? I know she and my other dog Harlow have had fleas for awhile, but Harlow hasnt acted this way at all and Nova(the pocket bully) hasn't done this at all before. 

Harlow hasn't been doing any of this behavior that Nova is, in fact, Harlow's been completely normal. I believe in the paranormal and I've been trying not to think its paranormal activity but its starting to freak me out lol. When Nova twirls her body around to see her tail its like something is pulling on it and she turns around to see it.. I used to play with her a lot and sometimes I would lightly pull on her tail, she reacted the same way. Twirled around to see what I was doing. She's been starring off at the table and my door when she's in my room, which is where she and i mostly are. She's always by my side, which is why I'm worried that a spirit might be haunting ME and negatively affecting her in return since dogs can sense that type of stuff that humans cant. ’ûﬂπ - ﬂπ’û

She's been doing the table thing mostly in the late evening/when the sunsuts and early in the morning when it rises. Its really freaking me out because its not even just like randomly, its specifically around 5-9pm and 5-9am. I'm not even that worried about it being a spirit, mostly worried about it doing something to my dog, or scaring her. I've been seeing shadows but I've just been telling myself I'm seeing things because I haven't been sleeping so well lately, lol, stupid insomnia. 

I'm going to ask my dad to take her to the vet here soon, hopefully its just something like stress. If anyone could help me figure out whats happening that would be great. I'm really worried about her. :( I'm also gonna be posting this to a paranormal type sub-reddit. ",1,1756726227.0,DogAdvice,2,1.0,False

1n5m6zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1n5m6zs/should_you_switch_to_terracor_ts1_compost_bags/,Should You Switch to Terracor T-S1 Compost Bags for Kitchen Waste,"Testing compostable trash bags has somehow become part of my daily routine. Those of us managing small kitchen compost bins or invested in environmentally sustainable practices know the importance of quality compost bags all too well. Recently, I switched to the Terracor T-S1, a 1.3-gallon compostable bag, and let me tell you, using this product feels like taking a tiny step toward helping the planet daily. With its BPI certification and ASTM D6400 compliance, I figured it was worth trying. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs pretty impressive, though not without its quirks.

**Packaging and Design That Stands Out**  
The Terracor T-S1 bags arrive rolled up neatly in a compact dispenser pack, which includes 35 bags per roll. This thoughtful design makes them convenient to store and access without dealing with unnecessary packaging bulk. The dimensions, at 15 inches by 15.7 inches, fit snugly into most small compost bins, particularly those designed for countertops. A smaller bag size like this works wonders for collecting food scraps like fruit peels, coffee grounds, and plant clippings. The subtle green hue of the bags also feels comforting, signaling their eco-focus.  

[Check Terracor T-S1 price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0f1tq1rsl/)  

**Strong Yet Environmentally Friendly Material Composition**  
Made from plant-based PLA (polylactic acid) and PBAT (polybutylene adipate terephthalate), these bags manage the tricky balance of durability and eco-consciousness. Whereas traditional plastics introduce eco headaches, PBAT makes the bags significantly biodegradable, while PLA keeps them tough enough to handle heavier organic waste without tearing. I specifically tried throwing in slightly damp kitchen scraps‚Äîcoffee filters, vegetable stems, even eggshells‚Äîand was impressed by how they held up.

**Benefits**  
- BPI certification guarantees the bags are compostable under industrial conditions, giving peace of mind.  
- Durable enough to handle various organic waste types, from wet to dry.  
- Perfect fit for countertop or small compost bins, eliminating unnecessary excess material.  

**Durability and Performance During Kitchen Tests**  
Durability, though often overlooked, determines whether I‚Äôll stick with any compost bag brand. No one wants leakage or tears when handling smelly food scraps! These stood up decently well under stress tests. Weekly kitchen trials of heavier peelings, like banana skins, went without drama. The bags start breaking down only after they‚Äôre exposed to industrial composting, so there‚Äôs zero worry about premature tears while storing them in your bin or bag holder. However, their thickness will not rival traditional plastic bags; hands-off handling is key unless cleaning spills is your thing.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Prone to weakening when left in humid conditions for too long before disposal.  
- Limited to specific climates and storage requirements (keep them cool and dry).  
- Best used within nine months to a year; they‚Äôre not ideal for long-term stockpiling.  

**Environmental Commitment and Ethical Choice**  
What makes these compostable trash bags worth considering over others is their core purpose: sustainability. Terracor doesn't just promise eco-friendly practices; it‚Äôs substantiated by certifications like ASTM D6400 and compliance with California‚Äôs stringent environmental guidelines. During industrial composting, these bags break down into water, CO2, and organic fertilizers in about 180 days. Knowing I‚Äôm using something that contributes to the planet was worth the purchase alone.

**Product Alternatives**  
Switching to compostable bags meant researching the competition too. Alternatives like BioBag or Unni Compost Bags also offer plant-derived materials, though I found the Terracor slightly thicker. In terms of certifications, BioBag may have a slight edge in availability across regions, while Unni might win in variety, offering rolls with different bag sizes. However, both lack the convenient dispenser packaging Terracor brings to the table. If sustainability isn‚Äôt your main priority, plastic biodegradable bags might appear cheaper yet defeat the purpose of going green.

**Cost Efficiency in Daily Use**  
From my experience, buying certified compostable bags can feel slightly pricier than regular alternatives. However, given their environmental benefits and decent performance, spending extra on Terracor T-S1 bags is manageable. Since each bag serves a clear purpose, it‚Äôs a trade-off that genuinely feels worth it, especially when keeping clean-up routines stress-free. Comparing local and international compostable options, these stuck out for hitting that sweet spot between affordability and effectiveness.

Why Is No One Talking About This?!,"Hold up‚Äîam I dreaming or is the whole 9-to-5 thing about to be over for GOOD?

I just stumbled onto something that blew my mind: there are at least 10 companies apparently fighting to HIRE people as *remote* (and I mean really remote) mobile app testers... for 2025. Like, from your couch, in your pajamas, squeezing in tests between doomscrolling and coffee refills. 

I'm literally shocked at how legit this looks, but also?? Confused as heck. Why is nobody talking about this? Why is my feed 99% ""work horse"" grind advice and not THIS goldmine?

And before you think, ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just another one of those borderline scams,‚Äù NO. I quadruple-checked the list on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (yup, gonna drop this link because wow), and some of these companies are names you‚Äôve ALL heard of.

Okay. So check this out. Here are just a *few* of the companies rumored to be aggressively hiring remote, flexible mobile app testers in 2025:

- **Zapier** (Yes, the beloved workflow automations one)
- **Headspace** (test meditation apps while literally meditating?!)
- **Duolingo**
- **GoodNovel** (I know, meta‚Äîsee their latest info here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**)
- **Grammarly**
- **Calm**
- **Notion**
- **Todoist**
- **Audible**
- **Canva**

If you read that and didn‚Äôt go ""wait, even DUOLINGO and AUDIBLE?!"" let‚Äôs take a breath together.

Apparently, the role basically involves:
- Testing new features for bugs (duh)
- Reporting what *normal users* would actually find annoying/confusing
- Sometimes creating short video or written feedback (aka TikTok, but paid)
- Most of the work is *async*‚Äîdo it whenever you want!

Comp feels‚Ä¶ honestly higher than expected? Some ranges I saw floated around on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (they post sample pay rates, btw) looked like $20‚Äì$45/hr, all depending on bandwidth and app complexity.

And the kicker‚Äîmost don‚Äôt need insane previous app dev skills. If you‚Äôre a techie: great. If you basically know how to aggressively use apps on your phone and sometimes roast companies on Reddit? Apparently also great. Some even have OPINION bonuses. You get paid for being snarky.

If someone had told me ‚Äúyou can get paid to find typos in Canva while lounging at Starbucks‚Äù I would‚Äôve straight-up laughed them out of the room‚Äîbut here we are, staring at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** in absolute disbelief.

I mean, have any of you actually snagged one of these roles? Or is it too good to be true? Let‚Äôs crowdsource some stories, because this whole flexible work-from-anywhere-app-tester vibe feels like the future snuck up on us overnight and nobody bothered to text me first.

* Say I've got all the JPEG files in a folder. I want to be able to manually change the order of the files in some random way and then play a slideshow with them.
* I want to have set up music beforehand and be able to tag music in different categories, for example certain music for business head shots and other music for baby photos
* and then I play the slideshow using the reset music from the right category

**Soft Crop**

* I want to be able to pre crop some photos before showing the client without actually editing the files.

**Selection**

* Next step would be selecting what photographs the client likes. This is as simple as tagging 12345 on each photo as we go And being able to filter all the ones with a certain number.
* The problem is these ratings need to be from the current session only. I want to be able to save a session for this client and see their selection, and not for everything tagged 2 from all different clients. 

**Why new software?**  
Proselect does all of this but here's what happened. They used to have a subscription and an outright purchase. I purchased the Pro version outright twice from them (each one gets half a year of updates). In July 2024 they announced they will no longer sell outright versions and will only sell subscriptions. We asked Proselect what would happen to the outright purchases - which they promised would work forever as long as we're happy that we don't get upgrades. At that time they changed their company name from TimeExposure to prostudiosoftware. End Aug 2025, they sent emails out to everyone saying they're turning off their servers in October and none of the outright purchases will work after that.

Why don't I want to pay $50 US month to keep using this, less than a coffee a day? Firstly I don't drink coffee and every single software is less than a coffee a day and it doesn't mean I can afford a 100 of them. Also why would you reward someone that treats you in this way?

**Other options**

* Lr does much of that, except we can't do slideshows very well and the slideshows are also very jerky. For some reason they take a huge amount of resources from the latest and greatest hardware.
* XnView is a great viewer but cannot do slideshows well. You can't preset music and you can't really random order. Also selections track across different uses so you can't really use it in that way. It cannot soft crop
* Photo Mechanic 5 does not have slideshows
* FastStone Image Viewer Selections track across different uses, viewing filters aren't great. the slide show also displays a very ugly 'slideshow finished' pop up at the end

In the end I think the main thing is the slideshow, I could possibly do the selection using Photo Mechanic 5.",1,1756725809.0,software,0,1.0,False

Kendu has both IRL efforts and social media efforts expanding on the foundations laid by Shib in 2021. In my opinion, IRL efforts are the main way that crypto will evolve. AI use, bot use and general bad actors in the space have caused investors to be very wary before having a stake in the game. This is where Kendu comes in, IRL efforts are a perfect way to show¬†**Proof of Humanity**¬†and that Kendu is something real and physical that will not disappear in an instant

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press¬†
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers

As you can see this is an insane catalogue and all developed by the average person, there is no team in Kendu. This is all under 20 million market cap too! Once the average person has more money as Kendu's market cap increases, so many currently sidelined initiatives will be announced and released. There is gonna be a tsunami of new efforts.

The future is so clear and all the signs are there...

1n5m2ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1n5m2ha/which_antifungal_worked_for_you/,Which anti-fungal worked for you?,"So I had a UTI 4 weeks ago which I cured with antibiotics (two different kinds as the first kind didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶). Immediately after things still felt strange but my peeing went back to normal. Turned out to be thrush‚Ä¶as I had white discharge and tingling feeling, extreme bloating and exhaustion. My doctor told me to take two flucazonale, 3 days apart. The discharge reduced fully and the itching reduced a bit but now I have renal itching. I think my thrush went untreated for 2 weeks though initially. 

I have heard candida diet can help. Therefore I haven‚Äôt eaten sugar for two weeks, nor drunk alcohol or coffee.

I decided to take a third flucazonale (since I have a large supply of them that I got from an online chemist, incase I get thrush/ candida overgrowth after antibiotics‚Ä¶). I took that 3 days after the second. It also hasn‚Äôt helped really. 

I‚Äôm getting concerned as after three anti fungal s it‚Äôs still lingering. My tongue has a really thick white coating now, my nails have turned to yellow also. Yesterday I had extreme pains under my right breastbone for 6 hours and bloating. The itching down there isn‚Äôt too bad but my entire body doesn‚Äôt feel right. I have such bad brain fog, initially I thought it‚Äôs lack of caffeine but no- everyday I feel like I don‚Äôt have the energy to talk to anyone. I‚Äôm also dizzy and disorientated.

All I‚Äôve been eating for two weeks is meat, low carb and yoghurt with probiotic. Does anyone have any advice?

1n5m0wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1n5m0wu/explore_if_the_xmnamc_vinyl_floor_repair_kit/,Explore If the Xmnamc Vinyl Floor Repair Kit Really Fixes Scratches,"The Xmnamc DBL-1 Vinyl Floor Repair Kit caught my eye because my kids have turned my house into a playground. Scratches and dings on my hardwood floors, chips on the corners of the cabinets, and mysterious dents appearing out of nowhere‚Äîmy home decor needed some serious TLC. This repair kit promised to fix all sorts of problems on multiple surfaces, so I decided to give it a whirl. Here's what I discovered.

**Design and Packaging**  
Straight out of the box, the repair kit was organized and functional. It includes 11 wax blocks in common wood colors, 8 wood touch-up markers, and a heat pen that runs on batteries. Each item felt thoughtfully designed for easy application, and the overall compactness of the package made it easy to store away when not in use. The heat pen was lightweight, simple, and fit comfortably in my hand. 

[Curious about Xmnamc DBL-1? Check price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0ddq7vmf1/)

**Ease of Use**  
I was initially skeptical about using a heat pen because, let‚Äôs face it, anything involving heat instantly feels complicated. But to my surprise, using this tool was straightforward. After installing the batteries correctly, I slid the switch on, and it only took about 15 seconds to heat up. I melted a wax block (the walnut shade matched my dining table perfectly) over a scratched surface, then let it cool before sanding it down a bit. It was genuinely satisfying! Even my teenager tried their hand at fixing a dented floorboard and came away feeling like a carpentry pro.

**Functionality**  
The repair kit excels in versatility. The 11 wax block colors range from light pine and maple to deep gray and black, while the markers come in similar shades, allowing for excellent color-matching. I experimented on an oak coffee table, my gray vinyl floor, and even a faded section of cabinet, and the results were impressive every time. The kit worked well to mask the scratches and blend with the original finishes, making the imperfections nearly invisible. It‚Äôs also perfect for fixing smaller issues like nail holes and minor cracks. However, don‚Äôt expect miracles; it won‚Äôt repair large structural damage, but for everyday wear and tear, it‚Äôs fantastic.

**Pluses**  
- Wide variety of colors to match different surfaces and finishes  
- Heat pen heats up quickly and is easy to use  
- Suitable for wood, vinyl, laminate, and linoleum surfaces  
- Compact and easy to store  
- Works well for touch-ups and superficial repairs  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Batteries for the heat pen are not included, which meant I had to make a quick trip to grab some before use  
- The wax blocks, while effective, do require some trial and error to find the perfect shade  
- Repairs on darker surfaces, like deep black or dark gray, sometimes required an extra layer to fully blend  

**Applications and Versatility**  
This repair kit turned out to be a superhero for my scratched dining table and an accidental chip on my vinyl flooring. I appreciated how it could cover scuffs, gouges, and even some lighter cracks. It‚Äôs incredibly versatile and could breathe new life into old furniture, revive dinged-up floors, or restore cabinets that have endured years of wear and tear. I could even see this being a lifesaver for pet owners whose furry friends have a knack for leaving their mark on everything.

**Product Competitors**  
I couldn‚Äôt help but compare this repair kit to Minwax‚Äôs filler set, which I‚Äôve used before. One area where the Xmnamc product excels is with its heat pen, making it better suited for detailed work. Minwax kits also typically focus on filler sticks, but they lack the same variety of colors this kit provides. While other repair kits like Rejuvenate markers are easy to use, they don‚Äôt include a tool for sealing and finishing the surface the way this one does. That said, the markers in this kit are slightly less pigmented, so extra care is needed to layer them correctly.

**Value Proposition**  
With the range of repairs I managed to complete using this product, I‚Äôd say it offers excellent value for its cost. Considering what it would have cost me to refinish an entire section of my vinyl floor‚Äîor, heaven forbid, replace it‚Äîthis repair kit was a much more affordable and less stressful solution. Plus, the satisfaction of DIY repairs gave it an extra edge. It‚Äôs rare to find a single kit that works effectively on such a wide range of surfaces and colors.

1n5m0uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1n5m0uq/explore_if_gain_liquid_laundry_detergent_truly/,Explore If Gain Liquid Laundry Detergent Truly Delivers Freshness,"Using the Gain 80351010 laundry detergent daily has been a unique olfactory and cleaning venture for me. As someone who juggles the chaos of kids and pets, I put this lavender-scented detergent to the test, probably far beyond what most detergents have to endure. With every load, the promise of six weeks of freshness filled my expectations, matched by that aromatic balance of jasmine and orange flowers. But, as with any product, there were definite highlights and a few aspects I felt could use some improvement.

**A Floral Symphony With Every Wash**

The lavender scent was the first thing that hit me once I poured it into the washing machine. Not overpowering but beautifully soothing, it felt like I had walked straight into a peaceful garden. Even my kids' soccer uniforms, which were usually a terrifying blend of dirt, sweat, and unidentified odors, came out smelling amazing. Several times, my co-workers even commented on how fresh my clothes smelled, proving this detergent indeed delivers its floral promises.

**Exceptional Cleaning Power**

This detergent tackles stains like it has a personal vendetta against grime. My youngest spilled chocolate syrup on his favorite white T-shirt ‚Äì typically a disaster. After a quick pretreat with the detergent (thanks to the Oxi Boost power), the shirt emerged immaculate. Even old coffee stains didn‚Äôt stand a chance. Having struggled with other options in the past, this one won me over with its sheer ability to wipe the slate clean.

*Time to see Gain 80351010 cost on Amazon.*([https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0bccpdhsp/](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0bccpdhsp/))

**Compatibility Across Washing Machines**

Living in an apartment with a very picky high-efficiency washing machine, I was relieved to see this product is compatible with virtually all washers. It worked seamlessly, even in cold water, which surprised me. My power bill thanked me, as running hot water is one thing I prefer to avoid when possible. It lathered beautifully without leaving behind any residue, a problem I‚Äôve had with some detergents that claim similar compatibility.

**Good Aspects**

- Strong stain-fighting capabilities due to Oxi Boost power  
- Long-lasting lavender scent with traces of jasmine and orange-flower  
- Cold-water compatibility helped save energy  
- Safe and suitable for various types of washing machines  

**Areas of Concern**

- The detergent jug is a bit hefty; it could use a better design for easier handling.  
- While the lavender is delightful, those sensitive to fragrances might find it slightly strong.  
- Avoid accidental spills ‚Äì the liquid consistency runs fast and needs to be poured with care.

**Competing Products**

When lining this up against brands like Tide with Downy or even household contenders like Persil, the advantages shine and dim in different areas. Where Gain excels in its aromatic longevity and ease in cold-water cleaning, others might offer stronger grease-cutting power (looking at you, Persil). Tide tends to focus on fabric care, keeping clothes soft, but the scent doesn‚Äôt last as long post-laundry. Occasionally, I missed the ultra-deep clean feeling from other detergents on greasy stains, but the sensory experience of lavender gains it a unique edge.

**Financial Value**

Considering what it offers, this detergent delivers a solid price-to-quality ratio. Yes, the container size would have me wondering how much I‚Äôd pay over time for its convenience, but honestly, that six-week fresh scent adds an intangible value. It spares me from constantly re-washing or overdosing clothes in scent boosters. You're getting a solid workhorse detergent capable of handling heavy laundry demands.

1n5ly4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1n5ly4i/delve_into_whether_soulink_lavender_laundry/,Delve Into Whether Soulink Lavender Laundry Sheets Really Work,"Testing the Soulink Lavender Laundry Detergent Sheets has been a surprisingly refreshing experience. The clever compact design of these laundry sheets made me skeptical at first. I usually stick to traditional liquid detergents that come in bulky, plastic jugs, but giving this eco-friendly alternative from Soulink a shot turned out to be worth it. With model number 1, these sheets promised big cleaning power in a small package‚Äîa claim I‚Äôve put to the test by washing everything from daily clothes to heavily soiled blankets. Spoiler alert: it lived up to the challenge in unexpected ways.

**Eco-Friendly Design and Portability**  
What grabbed my attention was the brand‚Äôs commitment to sustainability. These laundry sheets come with zero plastic packaging, and the lightweight, compact form makes storage ridiculously simple. I don‚Äôt have a laundry room bursting with extra shelf space, and these sheets took up a fraction of what a typical jug would. When my family recently went camping, tossing a few sheets into my bag was so much easier than dealing with heavy detergent bottles at the campsite. The biodegradable packaging reassured me that my wash wasn‚Äôt needlessly contributing to landfill waste.

[Check Soulink 1 price on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0bmzzgc7k/)

**Cleaning Performance in Real-World Use**  
The big claim here is that these sheets dissolve easily and leave no residue, which I tested on some heavily stained t-shirts and a pair of muddy jeans from a hiking trip. I used both cold and warm water cycles (the sheets claim compatibility with both), and every time, they worked impressively well. Stains from coffee, pasta sauce, and even oil washed out completely. Coming from someone who's lost battles to stubborn red wine spills, this is a game-changer.

What‚Äôs more, my HE washing machine worked without a hitch. No leftover gunk in the dispenser or awkward clumps stuck to clothes. My coworker, who‚Äôs sensitive to heavily fragranced laundry products, was curious about its mild smell after I mentioned it. It‚Äôs refreshingly natural, like lavender but not overly perfumed or chemically. If you‚Äôre someone who hates overpowering scents, this is right up your alley.

**Suitable for Sensitive Skin Types**  
The plant-based formula in these detergent sheets is another significant perk. Having children with sensitive skin has taught me a lot about how harsh traditional detergents can be. This one being paraben-free, phosphate-free, and dye-free is a bonus. My laundry routine often includes my toddler‚Äôs clothes, which means I‚Äôm constantly searching for a detergent that‚Äôs tough on messes but gentle on skin. After using this for weeks, I haven‚Äôt seen a single complaint or itchy rash from anyone in my household, including me. 

**Good Points**  
- Compact and lightweight form is ideal for small spaces and travel.  
- Eco-friendly packaging with no plastic waste.  
- Strong stain-fighting power that works equally well in warm and cold water.  
- Plant-based and safe for sensitive skin.  
- Mild lavender scent that isn‚Äôt overpowering.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Sheets sometimes stick together in humid conditions, which slows things down.  
- Doesn‚Äôt feel as satisfying as pouring liquid detergent‚Äîyes, this might just be a me thing!  
- May not be ideal for people who prefer heavily scented laundry products.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing these sheets to mainstream jugged detergents like Tide or Arm & Hammer, the eco aspect puts Soulink ahead immediately. However, one noticeable drawback is that traditional liquid detergents sometimes offer more robust anti-bacterial formulas, which could edge them out for families concerned about sanitization. Compared to another eco-conscious option, Tru Earth detergent strips, these provide similar results, although Tru Earth does offer unscented options which might appeal to scent-free households. For me personally, Soulink strikes a better balance between effective cleaning and gentle ingredients, making it my top pick for regular use.

**True Value**  
The question remains: is it worth switching from your typical detergent? Between the benefits of being lightweight, eco-friendly, and travel-compatible, I think these sheets check off a lot of modern-day needs that bottles struggle with. Sure, they might be slightly pricier per wash cycle, but the difference is marginal when you consider the added convenience and the environmental trade-off. Families like mine who care about reducing carbon footprints‚Äîand avoiding messy detergent spills‚Äîwill find the investment well justified.

I was stressing about being late for work and fobbed him off a bit, nicely I hope. I felt bad about it and went back to try and find him when I realised I had more time than I thought but he‚Äôd gone. He had a white beard, brown coat, possibly doing it rough but clearly looking after himself. He seemed like a lovely guy. Does anyone know him or know how I could get in touch with him? I‚Äôd love to make it up to him, buy one or more of his stories, maybe a cup of coffee. Please let me know. ",33,1756725113.0,Adelaide,11,0.92,False

1n5lv3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n5lv3n/we_spoke_after_30_days_no_contact_today/,We spoke after 30 days no contact today,"After 5 years together, we had grown to really resent each other. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we loved each other deeply, but we argued so much. We had different values, different life goals, completely different hobbies. We both changed a lot over the years and we just grew incompatible. We were both in denial for a long time and we both fought so much because we were trying so hard to make it work. 

After a series a few really bad arguments and faux break ups, I told him I‚Äôd seek therapy. I went to the therapist and told them all of the things I had done wrong in the relationship and begged for advice to fix myself. After a couple of sessions I realised that I was so deep in this trauma loop of fighting, making up and then walking on eggshells to avoid further arguments that I completely lost myself. His moods dictated my mood, I spent all of my time worrying about him and I genuinely started believing the awful things he‚Äôd say about me when we were in the heat of an argument. He framed his control as my incompetence. He often made me feel like a fool and I was always questioning what was wrong with me. 

We stayed in a very toxic cycle for far too long. We weren‚Äôt sleeping in the same bed anymore. He stopped showing affection towards me as a form of punishment. He was cold, distant and I cried daily. I tried to overcompensate - I would make his favourite dinners, shower him with gifts, love notes and anything I could do to make him feel special and try to bridge the ever growing void. 

There were moments of hope, fleeting but passionate. The moments of hope were growing fewer and far between. A week before I left, we were actually doing really well. We had communicated a lot and I felt like we were moving forward. He even showed me small signs of affection which I absolutely lapped up. I was feeling on cloud nine due to the bare minimum and I didn‚Äôt realise it because I was so accustomed to the chaos. 

The day I left, we had slept in the same bed together for the first time in a long time. I had a vivid dream that night of myself repeating the words ‚Äúit‚Äôs not working.‚Äù I woke up feeling happy but also extremely scared that I‚Äôd woken him up through the night and he‚Äôd wake up angry. I wear an uncomfortable snoring aid when I sleep with him because he complains of my snoring (which was never an issue for the first 4 years of sleeping with me) and I got so sick of him being upset with me. This particular morning I wake up before him and I decide to do my best to de-escalate any potential issues by making him a coffee and bringing it to him in bed, logging into his work laptop so he can sleep in and letting out/feeding the animals. I let him sleep in and wake him gently with a coffee, ‚Äúgood morning my love, I have a coffee for you, I hope you slept well‚Äù. I knew immediately it wasn‚Äôt going to be good - he opened his eyes, looked annoyed at me, grabbed the coffee and told me I‚Äôd ruined his sleep. I apologised and told him I‚Äôd sleep elsewhere tonight. I remember feeling so low, so defeated. 

After how good things were seemingly going, he flipped back to his old ways so quickly. I remember thinking I just wanted to cuddle him at night, he was the most gentle toward me in the middle of night and he didn‚Äôt want me anymore. I felt myself get frustrated that we were back here again, so I told him that if I ruin his sleep and I ruin his life then I‚Äôll leave. He then tried to gaslight me into believing he hadn‚Äôt woken up in a bad mood and I was being manipulative. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, but I saw red like I haven‚Äôt before. I completely lost it at him and he was just sitting there rolling his eyes. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it, but I even punched the wall, I was just so frustrated. I grabbed my suitcase and a handful of clothes and told him I was leaving. He didn‚Äôt believe me. He works from home so he went about his business for the morning and I went to my grandparents house. 

I went back later that afternoon to get more of my things. When I returned to the house, he finally realise I was serious. He stood in the doorway begging for me to stay. He said we could work it out. I said I was done being so unhappy all the time. I told him I needed space and time and he said if I walk out the door then it‚Äôs done for good. I left. He began texting me, telling me to come back and fix things. But it‚Äôs like something snapped in me, I couldn‚Äôt go back. 

Logistics were a nightmare as you‚Äôd imagine after being together for so many years. I‚Äôm heartbroken the animals are staying with him and he‚Äôs keeping our rental. 

After a few days of being out of the house, he reached out and we met up. I felt extremely complex emotions during this time - I was grieving, I was missing him, I felt relief and then I would spiral into regret and questioning my decision. During this time, he was doing everything right. He had reflected deeply, apologised, been understanding and supportive while saying all the things I‚Äôd been begging for during the last six months. It was tough. We decided to stay separated, but exclusive to each other while we had space to figure things out. 

We tried to do casual dating, he took me out a couple times and was very romantic, but things felt off. I think we both noticed that nothing had actually changed and we were still not compatible in so many ways. Small tensions started to arise between us again and we weren‚Äôt even dating. About two weeks after the breakup, we met up and I just cried and cried, I couldn‚Äôt even speak. I couldn‚Äôt really explain why, but my body was telling me. After this, I suggested a 30 day no contact period to give my nervous system a rest and really think about what I want. He agreed and we both agreed to not see other people during this time. 

At the beginning of the 30 days, I felt such incredible grief and sadness. I got really sick with the flu during this time and I felt so alone with no one to care for me. I knew it was over, but my brain kept telling me there was still a way forward if I wanted it. It felt like the decision was entirely in my hands and I could be ruining my future if I didn‚Äôt try and fix it one more time. But I kept telling myself, how many more years are you going to waste? 

Towards the end of the 30 days, I felt a sense of relief and freedom I haven‚Äôt felt in years. I had no idea my body needed a rest like this. It feels incredible to wake up and not have to worry about someone‚Äôs mood or having an argument. I can do what I want, eat what I want, sing as loudly as I want and do all the things for myself I‚Äôve neglected over the years. I‚Äôve been doing self-care and really starting to listen to my intuition again. I‚Äôm journaling, scaling my business, focusing on family and doing little things that make me happy. 

Today, it‚Äôs been 30 days. I text him and ask him whether he‚Äôd like to meet - he called instead. He asked me whether it was worth meeting in person or not? I told him honestly that it probably wouldn‚Äôt change things. We both immediately knew that we‚Äôd both decided it was time. It was a bittersweet phone call. We both said we loved each other but it was definitely time to let go. He asked me if it was my final decision and I said yes. He then asked whether that means we are able to see other people and I said yes. I could tell this hurt him and it also doesn‚Äôt make me feel great either, but we can‚Äôt keep holding on. He asked if we could extend the exclusivity period and try casual dating again - I told him firmly that it wasn‚Äôt a good idea and we‚Äôd tried before. We have a long, complex history and I just can‚Äôt see it ever being repaired. I can never go back into that toxic cycle again. We ended the call in tears, both giving our well wishes, thanks for the good times and sending our love.  

Now that it‚Äôs really over, I feel like I‚Äôm in shock. I was feeling really good about this breakup until I spoke with him and now I feel all of this pain and uncertainty again. I know this is for the best, but it hurts so much. Saying goodbye to someone you loved so fiercely for so long is a torture in itself. 

This post has been my own form of therapy to process what happened today. If you read this far, thank you for listening. ‚ù§Ô∏è",9,1756725023.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1n5ltnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1n5ltnp/student_resume_review_miscs_minor_student_seeking/,[Student] Resume Review ‚Äì MIS/CS Minor Student Seeking Feedback on Tailoring Resume Toward Sales Engineer Career Pathway,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôve always loved the blend of sales and technology, and through that interest I discovered sales engineering (I know it goes by different names, but that‚Äôs the role I want to pursue after graduation).

This past summer I interned as a Solutions Sales Engineer, where I worked on building an asset tracking system, presented a monitoring solution to 80+ SEs, and supported proof-of-concept prep. Unfortunately, I won‚Äôt be receiving a full-time return offer due to budgeting (though things could change depending on Q4 revenue). Either way, I want to stay ahead of the game, perfect my resume, and continue applying to open positions.

Since sales engineering is a more niche field, I‚Äôd really appreciate honest feedback. Two experiences I haven‚Äôt included on my resume (due to space) are:

Consulting Group Website Project ‚Äì designed and published a client-facing site using Figma, HTML, Python, and Wix.

Nordstrom Sales Associate ‚Äì worked in high-end retail sales after Audi and before Apple.

My main question is: How can I better tailor my resume to highlight Sales Engineer and is there anything more I should be doing right now to prepare for that career path?

Should I restructure my resume to make room for these, or keep the current flow? Any advice on what to cut, what to highlight, or other steps to strengthen my Sales Engineering profile would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance for the honest feedback

1n5lrxy,https://i.redd.it/t0ndkxybcjmf1.jpeg,"[OC]: Chronicler, the best worldbuilding app! Second month of progress :)","Hello again, everyone,

For this who missed it, Chronicler is a **cross-platform, offline worldbuilding app** that uses **local** **Markdown** files **compatible with Obsidian**. You can find out more here - [https://chronicler.pro/](https://chronicler.pro/)

And for those who want to join the community, here is the Discord server :) [https://discord.gg/cXJwcbe2b7](https://discord.gg/cXJwcbe2b7)

The momentum from the first month continues, and **Chronicler** is rapidly evolving from a powerful core into a truly feature-rich application. I'm still working on this full-time, and your incredible support is what makes this possible :)

Here‚Äôs a look at the massive progress from month two, week by week:

**Week 1: Rock-Solid Core**

The second month kicked off with a huge focus on improving the application‚Äôs foundation to make it faster and more reliable than ever.

* üõ°Ô∏è **Data Integrity**: I implemented atomic file writes and fully transactional file operations. This protects your data from corruption, even if the app crashes mid-save.
* ‚ö°Ô∏è **Major Performance Gains**: The entire state management system was reworked to use granular locking, making the UI significantly more responsive by allowing different operations to run in parallel.
* üñºÔ∏è **Full-Screen Image Viewer**: You can now click on any image file in the explorer to open it in a beautiful full-screen viewer.

**Week 2: The Customization Revolution**

This week was all about making Chronicler truly yours. A whole suite of features was added to give you complete control over the look and feel of your workspace.

* üé® **Theme Switcher**: You can now choose from several beautiful built-in themes from the Settings modal.
* ‚ú® **User-Defined Theme Editor**: The flagship feature of the week! A full theme editor was built, allowing you to create, save, and edit an unlimited number of custom themes.
* üëÄ **Live Preview**: The theme editor updates the entire application UI in real-time as you tweak colors, so you can see your changes instantly.
* üîç **Font Size Control**: For better readability, a new slider was added to the settings to let you adjust the application's base font size.

**Week 3: Professional Polish**

With the core experience and customization in place, I turned my attention to professional-grade features and preparing the app for its future.

* ‚öôÔ∏è **Hybrid Settings Model**: A sophisticated new settings system was implemented that intelligently separates global settings (like custom themes) from vault-specific settings (like the active theme or font size), making your vaults portable and self-contained.
* ‚úíÔ∏è **Advanced Font Selection**: The theme editor was enhanced to allow for separate font choices for headings and body text.
* ü´£ **Discord-style Spoilers**: A new feature was added to support spoilers in the page preview.
* üêß **Linux Stability**: A critical crash affecting users on Wayland-based systems (like Arch Linux and the Steam Deck) was resolved.
* üîë **Official Licensing System**: The complete backend for validating and managing user licenses was built, paving the way for Chronicler's official release.

**Week 4: A Content Creation Powerhouse**

The last part of the month was an absolute explosion of new features designed to streamline your creative workflow and make writing and organizing your world a joy.

* üñºÔ∏è **Embeddable Images**: You now have full control over images in your documents. You can embed them directly in the page body using standard HTML <img> tags.
* üìú **Page Templates**: A full system for creating, managing, and using page templates was added. You can start new pages with pre-defined content from a new dropdown menu.
* üîó **Broken Link Reports**: A new ""Reports"" tab was added, featuring a report that lists all broken wikilinks in your vault. You can create the missing pages directly from the list or by clicking the broken link in the preview pane.

As you can see, the pace has been relentless, and the feature list has more than doubled in just one month. We've gone from a solid foundation to a truly powerful and customizable tool for writers and worldbuilders.

I'm still fully committed to this project, and as an independent developer, this is only possible because of the direct support from patrons and donors. It is my only source of income, and it's what allows me to dedicate all my time to building Chronicler.

If you are excited about the direction of Chronicler and want to ensure development continues, please consider becoming a supporter. Every contribution, big or small, has a massive impact.

I don't know how it happened but life just goes the way it does. The first day we met I saw you light up a room by just walking in. You were single at that time, but me with my stupid rules couldn't be bothered to even try to ask you for coffee. Weeks go by, but I can't get you out of my head. I just kept trying to date others. I went on 30 dates, but none of them made an impact on me like you did. They never even compared. 
Then when I finally got the urge to ask you out the damage was already done. Your ex showed his true colors leaving you with an open wound. I saw the woman behind it still, and tried helping close the wound by being nice. It helped I saw that it did even if you insulted me behind my back. 
You thought I wanted more from you. I did and still do, but at that time I was hurting so much and my own mask hides way to much, but you still saw some of it or maybe you didn't. 
I'm sure if you see this it won't change a thing but I can't send this to you, because it'll ruin everything. You calling me at midnight and then avoiding me shows me that your feelings run to deep and they're scaring you. Maybe the separation is for the best. Maybe me leaving is even better so we both can let this connection die. As much as I don't want it to die, I think it should. I told you my feelings but you're to scared to admit yours. You think I want to pressure you into something, but I don't I just wanted to hear you say what you felt. 
I wish you the Best

But what if you‚Äôre wondering how to find bookkeeping clients¬†*without*¬†social media? Rest assured there are many proven strategies. This article will explore some practical ways to grow your bookkeeping business without relying on social platforms.

# Start With Your Network

Your existing network is a goldmine for referrals. Reach out to former colleagues, friends, family, and even your neighbours. Let them know you‚Äôre a bookkeeper and looking for clients.

# How to Tap Into Your Network:

* **Send Personalised Emails**: Write a professional email explaining your services and asking for referrals.
* **Host Informal Meetups**: Coffee catch-ups or networking breakfasts can spark conversations that lead to clients.
* **Join Local Business Groups**: Check out local chambers of commerce or small business associations.

If the idea of networking fills you with dread, know that you‚Äôre not alone. We have a 6-hour comprehensive networking training built into the Sales Collection of The Bookkeepers‚Äô Collective because we know that networking is an essential skill. Find out how to work with us for just ¬£199+VAT per month,¬†[here](http://6figurebookkeeper.thinkific.com/).

# Leverage Word-of-Mouth Referrals

Word-of-mouth is still one of the most powerful marketing tools. Happy clients often talk about their experience, so ensure you deliver exceptional service.

# Encourage Referrals:

* **Ask Satisfied Clients**: Politely request clients to refer you to their peers.
* **Create a Referral Program**: Offer incentives like a gift voucher or donation to charity for successful referrals.
* **Partner with Other Professionals**: Collaborate with accountants, financial advisors, or virtual assistants who can refer their clients to you.

# Attend Networking Events

Face-to-face networking helps you build strong, personal connections. Seek out local events or industry meetups where your target clients are likely to gather.

# Where to Network:

* **Business Expos**: These events are perfect for meeting entrepreneurs who might need your services.
* **Industry Conferences**: Attend events tailored to specific industries, like retail or hospitality, where businesses often need bookkeeping support.
* **Community Events**: Look for small business fairs or local gatherings like the school fete.

# Offer Free Workshops or Consultations

‚Äîat hobbying, that is. Somehow, I've gotta find a way to work that line into ""Volume, Value and Variety"" because it is definitely part of my hobbying philosophy.

The wonderful wide world of hobbying has afforded me many luxuries and conveniences. For a workaholic such as myself who doesn't take vacations, I've been able to pamper myself sexually by using escorts.

About that title \[Outcalls are the best, especially those done at my residence\], I'd like to issue a disclaimer since people apparently need disclaimers:

DISCLAIMER:

I am posting this because that's what we do on this sub‚Äîshare about our experiences and about our enjoyment of the sport. That's the primary purpose behind me penning this and, as usual, I love quantifying my points using lists, charts, etc. However, this is not to TELL people to start doing residence-outcalls, too.

As for those who are contemplating doing the same, well, here's how I do it. You may choose to replicate it, or not. YMMV. Anyway, here are my reasons for outcalls in general as well as at my residence-outcalls. Let's go.

# My initial aversion to outcalls¬†

I can pinpoint the exact date when I started doing outcalls, thanks to my texting history and spreadsheets. Even more specifically, I can pinpoint when I started doing them at my residence. While living and working in New York, even though I often booked a day-use motel, I was still mostly doing incalls. My biggest fear back then was being seen by the many people I knew around the city.

It's when I left New York and started traveling for work that I began doing more outcalls. But as you'll read later on, it took a while still for me to start doing them at my residence. Let me stick with outcalls in general first.

# It's all about convenience

Everything about hobbying is and should be about you feeling good and having things your way. It's the DoorDash of prostitution. There's a set of specific things conveniences that outcalls gives me which I place a premium on:

* Post-coital bliss. No need to come off of your high. No feeling as if you're imposing, and no getting rushed out once the sex is done. No worrying about messing up her bed and getting your sweat on the sheets. It's your place so you can take your time and savor the moment.
* No need to get dressed. One serious thing that bothers me isn't just rushing out but having to put clothes back on after sex. It acts like a sensation blocker.
* No drive home. This is another thing that takes away from the post-coital bliss.
* Straight to bed. Many times, I've escorted my escorts to the door butt-naked to let them out and hopped straight into bed. There's no better way to fall asleep, from the heavenly sensation of fucking to a heavenly dream. Then get up, shower, coffee, and off to work.

I could end the post right here as this constitutes my personal preference for outcalls. But now to jump into the next level.

# At my private residence

Everything I've said up to this point can apply to my hotel rooms or even the day-use motels that I would get all the way back since my first year. The shift to doing outcalls at my residence came later. Before then, I had a strict policy AGAINST having them at my place. So, even while I was going city to city and didn't have to worry about being seen by people that knew me, I would resort to getting a hotel room located a few minutes from my place in order to enjoy the benefits of an outcall.

It wasn't until March 2019 that I started doing residence-outcalls. KRISTINA is the perfect example. When I first started using her in October 2018, I still had my rule against residence-outcalls. When that changed, she was among the first ones and rightfully so because we already had a rapport.

# AFTER:

# Home field advantage

Having an escort come to my hotel grants a level of home field advantage. But no matter how nice that hotel is, having her come to my residence is a home field advantage on a totally different level. My residence is my wing man. It's like it makes the girls open up their legs wider and makes their pussies wetter by default. Like it is with many things related to transactional sex, there's a whole psychological aspect to it. I believe the principles of a woman's criteria for a suitable mate apply here.

https://preview.redd.it/ukgfcy20ajmf1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=5834fca7bc5da06361b3c0bb4ba6accccce015e7

* **It works on escorts of all ages**, and it especially potent on young escorts. And although it's clear that this is transactional sex and not even dating or a one-night-stand done the old-fashioned way, similar rules of possessions and material worth also apply here.
* **They go, ""This is where you live?""** There's something about where a client LIVES versus which room a client rented at a hotel for a day or two. I always get compliments when they are walking in.
* **Then they say, ""Wow, it's so clean!""** Again, a hotel room can be clean especially since we're there just for the night. But a clean residence registers something on another level. Although the Reddit hags will fuck a dude with horrible hygiene and a filthy apartment simply because they pay well (which makes THEM the true slobbyists), my place stays immaculate because it is an extension of the caliber of man that I've always been. I'm a clean-cut professional who gives presentations to company department heads and pitches to venture capitalists. How else would my residence look!?!

# My concerns and the precautions I took

It goes without saying that I am concerned about things going wrong. Although I consider myself a good judge of character and one whose Spidey senses are sharply tuned, I do have a list of precautions that I take for these residence-outcalls:

* I usually stay at gated townhouse communities or high-rise buildings with security and a buzzing-in system.
* At the gated townhouse, I'd give the escorts the address to the main club building and meet them there. I wouldn't give them the direct address.
* I'd meet them at the main building and give them the once-over before having them follow me down the winding roads to my townhouse apartment.
* Not only am I checking to see if she wasn't a bait-n-switch or is at least fuckable, I'm also checking to see if she came with anyone and whether that someone is an associate of hers or just a driver.
* Once inside my place, I had already made sure to not leave sensitive items around: no mail with my name, no phones or watches lying around (although I've left my watch at incalls - that story is for later), my wallet is in the drawer of my guest room, etc.

An example of this is the post on sneaking in escorts past my nosy neighbors.

# It's an exercise in trust

I need to say it more often that in spite of the stories of drama-filled encounters with escorts, my hobbying is something like 95% positive experiences with truly great girls, particularly my ultra-GFE long-time regulars. I've built rapport and trust with them from the many times I've had them. As a result, I do extra things to display trust, which in turn causes them to make themselves more trustworthy. And this trust spills over to the sex itself; more features, more intimacy, etc.



# It's also an exercise in boldness

Yeaaaah üò¨... this point may need to be flagged as ""do not try this at home."" Honestly, THIS is the secondary point behind me making this post in the first place. One would wonder aloud...

*""Why the hell are you trying to trying to be bold by inviting hookers to your residence, in the middle of the night no less? What are you trying to prove? You could get yourself in a lot of trouble! Robbed or even killed!*

The simple answer is I don't set out looking for dangerous situations. Instead, it's the outcome of my stress-fucking, more specifically, my penchant to book escorts during demon hour due to the need for some sexual stress relief.

I sometimes get some interesting/shady/potential troublemakers because the girls that are available during demon hour tend to be themselves quite bold, and many of them are strippers.

Having them come to my place is actually SAFER than me showing up to their incall. I implement the safety measures mentioned back in point #5. Even after that, my attitude and comportment is what keeps the encounter pleasant and enjoyable. THAT'S what I mean by boldness.

https://preview.redd.it/f8j03f7aajmf1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe8b8c573bab7a0b605b5d12da8081a8e637c90

So even if I had a feisty stripper over at 2AM, she'd never get out of pocket or look at me as a potential ""lick"" or a ""come-up."" She'd come over, get fucked, swallow cum, and be out the door on her merry way. All of that depended on MY attitude and comportment.

Still, I'll repeat the disclaimer here. Use caution and trust your Spidey senses.

All I'm telling you is that things have gone very well for me.

GOTTA END IT HERE BECAUSE THIS GOT TOO LONG.

In (Part 2), there are the specific EXAMPLES of the many residence-outcall escorts: my first one, my first live-in escort, my weekly routine of 3 escorts at my place, even the connection between this and using CashApp, etc.

Damn! This post turned out quite technical and ""unsexy"", exactly what I recently said I wanted to avoid. Fear not, readers, because (Part 2) has plenty of mentions of convincing college-aged escorts to take bare dick and receive creampies. üôÇ

‚ÄãStay safe and enjoy the sport!



‚ÄîHappy hobbying, gents!

I hope this post it's relevant even if it's not about a technical question on TD <3

Hello everyone, I had a job as an experience designer (immersive installations/projections/design for visuals and interactive prototypes) and got laid off. Currently, I'm searching for a job during these challenging times. I come here to learn about your experiences and maybe to find some comfort from fellow artists and touchdesigner passionate.

I don't like LinkedIn for job searching in this field. Where I worked usually new colleagues were hired because someone presented them to managers, then after a coffee and some chats they got the position (Im based in NL).

I like to attend creative events and I'm not afraid to have a chat, but emails are scary for me üòÖ. I am sending them anyway, but I am more comfortable with a chat face to face.

So, I'm curious to hear about your experience with job searching.   
Maybe most of you are freelancing? (I never freelanced for example)  
Did someone present you to help you find a place? Do you curate your portfolio and share it consistently to people you know? How do you grow your network?

Would you like to be approached with an email where you get asked for a coffee to hear about your approach to projects and a possible collaboration?

I hope this open hearted questions can spark some chats.",3,1756723233.0,TouchDesigner,0,1.0,False

So I'm an original Kickstarter backer for the 064S, running stock burrs. It's paired with a Bambino Plus, and overall really enjoy the coffee I make, and the workflow. I primarily drink milk drinks, with occasional long blacks and straight shots... mostly medium roast beans. I do drink pourover too, but I use a handgrinder for this, and happy to keep doing so... so espresso is definitely the focus. I'm considering getting a second (conical?) grinder for more traditional, syrupy shots... in an ideal world I'd probably just grab a Niche, but ¬£550 is definitely more than I'm willing to spend. 

Requirements >  
Small footprint (not much room in the coffee nook for a second grinder)  
Single dose capable  
Low retention  
'Traditional' high body espresso flavour profile

Looking at what's out there, several of the small footprint conicals (e.g. Lagom Casa) seem to be more geared towards clarity. I did come across the Femobook A4, which is available for a great price right now ($280) and seems to fit the bill re. all the other options... but I can't find many reviews, and - given it's allegedly the same burr set as the 1zpresso JX-Pro - I don't know if there would be enough of a difference vs the 064s stock burrs to justify the purchase. Another one I've seen mentioned is the Varia VS3 Gen 2, specifically with the Hypernova burr set... however I've read some anecdotes about the reliability being in question, and issues with drift. The new Encore ESP Pro seemed a decent option too, but it only just launched, and there already seem are some issues with clogging from early reports. 

What options am I missing? Analysis paralysis RN, and nothing's actually broken with my current setup... a lot of it is curiosity to try something new as I've little experience with other grinders or burrs. FWIW the 064S was my first good espresso capable grinder after struggling with a SGP for my first couple of years making espresso. 

In all honesty I would probably get more value out of a new machine than grinder, but I'm determined to see the Bambino out before upgrading üòÖ",3,1756723140.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

spent way too many mornings manually checking like 15 competitor sites before coffee. my wife kept telling me ""marcus youre obsessing over this"" but honestly it was stressing me out. gear pricing changes daily and i was just winging it at this point lol.

  
then last month got completely blindsided again when REI dropped their backpack prices and didnt notice for 3 days. that was my breaking point. started looking for something to automate this mess and found tracksimple. setup was annoying (took me like 2 hours to figure out all the settings) but now i get alerts when anyone changes prices.

  
still not perfect - sometimes it misses smaller retailers - but saves me like an hour every morning and havent been caught off guard since. gear market is brutal and this at least keeps me somewhat competitive.

1n5l78l,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1n5l78l/picked_up_and_taken_to_court_but_never_received_a/,Picked up and taken to court but never received a subpoena?," Hi, So a few months ago, February, I had a knock on the door early in the morning. My dog barked and I went to the door and had three sheriffs standing there. I went outside and greeted them. They asked me my name and birthdate and I cooperated completely. They told me to turn around and I was placed in handcuffs and they paraded me out and took me to the court house. I was still in my pyjama pants, no socks and a t-shirt. I'd just woken up and hadn't even made coffee yet. The sheriffs thanked me multiple times for how cooperative I was being. I have never had any legal problems in the past.

 I was placed in a freezing holding cell for six hours before seeing the judge. No socks and I didn't even have time to wash my face.

 For a bit of insight, I have had an ongoing estate dispute with my sister. This might not be relevant but I was the caregiver for my mom and my grandmother both before they passed. My mom had signed over power of attorney to me.

  In the 5 years that my mom suffered through her lung cancer my (half) sister never came to visit her once. My sister and her ""husband"" were married for 8 years and her ""husband"" never once met our mom. They were married secretly in Las Vegas and didn't inform my mom or I of their marriage for a year until after they were married. My sister has dual citizenship. My sister's biological father was a draft dodger who left my mom once the Vietnam war ended. Her ""husband"" is a Canadian citizen who wanted to move down to the states but they never sorted out his green card. He was living there illegally. Truthfully they are both straight up deadbeats. 

 Anyways, before my mom died. I talked my sister into coming to be here. She reluctantly made it. In the days before my mom's passing, I had a verbal discussion with my sister. I talked to her about a few things regarding our family home and estate. I've grown up here but had moved to Europe for some time but returned when my Grannie was not doing well and then my mom was diagnosed with cancer. This has been my home my entire life. While in high school I built an addition with my dad onto the house  before my parents separated. I built a legal suite onto the house for my grandmother to move into by myself. I've built 3/4 of this house by myself and my sister has never once mowed the lawn or pruned a tree. Unfortunately my grandmother passed before the suite was finished and then my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer but she was able to enjoy the new suite for 3 years before she died. It was important for her to have her own bathroom while going through chemo therapy. 

 My sister verbally promised me that she would never force a sale on our family home unless both of us were in agreement. In my grief, I took her for her word and on the eve of my mom's passing I wrote up a will for my mom.  I had planned on adding that clause to the Will but in my grief and after my sisters verbal agreement I omitted it. My mom was my best friend and we had a wonderful relationship. I had previously discussed my mom's wishes with her many times and knew what she wanted. Her wish was for us to continue to have a family home. A home base as you will as she never had that growing up. She also asked me what I wanted, 60% 75%? I always told her that I was fine with sharing the estate with my sister as long as she would never force a sale unless we were both in agreement. The same things that my sister told me in the days before my mom died. 

 4 days after my mom died my sister told me that I would have to buy her out or we would have to sell. Our property values have increased 100% in the past decade and my sister knows that I will not be able to afford the cost on my own. I have never wanted to take anything away from my sister but I also have not wanted to loose our home. That was our mom's wishes and the verbal agreement that I had made with my sister. That was the understanding when I picked up my mom's incapacitated hand to sign her Will. Both of my mom's best friends who witnessed the singing understood that as well and are in agreement with me. They know the care and work I have put in and the increase in the property value that I have worked towards. Now that I am alone I have been non stop harassed by my sister and her ""husband"". They have an open relationship and do not even share a bedroom. He has an illegal vape juice business and both of them are on the run from the CRA. My sister hasn't paid her taxes in 10 years. 

 At this point I don't know what to do. I've been covering all of the bills for the property on my own. I've paid every cent towards the water and sewer, the property taxes and payments towards the debt that my mother left when she had died. I have paid every bill as well as for our mom's cremation. I have cared for and fed my mom's 2 cats and dog. It has made me depressed, anxious and scared. 

 If you have made it this far I really appreciate it! 

 So my question is. Can I or should I invalidate the Will? I only made it to try to make things easier on my sister and I with my mother's wishes in mind and the verbal promise that I had from my sister. 

 Do I have any recourse after being detained and held without having ever received a subpoena?  I had no idea that I had a court date or that I had even missed one.

 Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Things have been difficult to deal with due to my depression and anxiety.

**Mark:** 278 / 300 or 93%

# Context

During Year 13, I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to study at university so I took a gap year. Around July in 2024 I decided to study Computer Science so I decided to sit Further Maths as an extra A-level to improve my application.

I achieved a strong A\* in A-level Maths in 2024 and had always been pretty good at Maths.

# Overview

I spent most of time in September and October preparing for the TMUA, which did not go as well as I had hoped. I started studying Further Maths around November. For the first few months I studied at home but around February (I think) I started mainly studying at the library or in a coffee shop. I used TL Maths YouTube videos to learn Core Pure 1 and Core Pure 2. I was lucky to get access to all the textbooks I needed online thanks to my school. For Further Pure 1, I started with Hind Maths, but I found that he didn‚Äôt go as in depth as I would‚Äôve liked so I decided to purchase a Bicen Maths subscription in mid February. I would work through questions from the textbook then go to Madasmaths for harder questions.

**Madasmaths tip:** Download all the PDF files you need onto the One Drive or a MEGA folder. Whenever you answer a question, cross it off using your browser‚Äôs native PDF editor. If you struggle with a question, underline it. Make sure to save the PDF every time so that way, you always know which questions you have answered and which ones you need to go back over.

I had around 6 hours of online tuition but I didn‚Äôt find it helpful ‚Äì the tutor would just explain a part of the topic then give me textbook questions to do.

# Rough timeline

* **Completed CP1:** December
* **Completed CP2:** Early February
* **Completed FP1:** Early march
* **Completed FP2:** Mid April

# Spaced Repetition

I found Anki quite useful for memorising things like definitions e.g. Group Theory or the formulae to things that I commonly use. On days where I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to sit down and do actual questions I always made sure to do at least one Maths flashcard. Anki uses a Spaced Repetition System which means it shows you cards just before you are about to forget them. This consolidates them in your memory and prevents you wasting time by reviewing flashcards you already know quite well. One of the important things about using Anki is you need to try and use it every single day otherwise the algorithm doesn‚Äôt work. I spent around 10 minutes or less a day answering Maths Anki flashcards. In total I had around 1200 cards. Here are some links to help you get started with Anki. Two must-have add-ons are Heatmap and Image Occlusion.

# Tracker

I created an Excel spreadsheet to get an idea of how long I spent studying this A-level. I kept track of the number of questions I answered and all the past papers I had completed. This was one of the things that kept me disciplined and pushed me to keep doing questions. I would say I completed about 60% of the questions in the textbook. I roughly tried to track my hours per topic as well. I got this idea from Ali Abdaal‚Äôs [retrospective revision timetable video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7o09a7t4RA). but I‚Äôve kind of modified it a bit to suit Further Maths ‚Äì I did use the unmodified technique for my previous A-levels though. I set targets of forty textbook questions and ten 4 star questions (Madasmaths) per topic, but these were completely arbitrary and were just there to motivate me.

# Making Notes

Sometimes, when a topic was quite difficult (e.g., conic sections or reduction formulae), I would write down a worked example and annotate it. This was basically just copying down an example from a Bicen Maths video. I made around 15 pages of notes like this and I only reviewed some of them a handful of times. Making notes like this helps to wrap your head around the new concepts.

https://preview.redd.it/carhx7iy5jmf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d42c93a4b8ae15eadafc93ed713d85ca3a57a7e9

# Time spent estimate

* **Reviewing flashcards:** 20 hours
* **Making flashcards:** 10 hours
* **General:** 40 hours
* **Core Pure 1:** 52 hours
* **Core Pure 2:** 60 hours
* **Further Pure 1:** 55 hours
* **Further Pure 2:** 56 hours
* **Past papers:** 33 papers done. 90 minutes doing, 30 minutes marking. 66 hour

**Total hours:** \~ 360 hours

I feel like this might be a bit of an overestimate but I can‚Äôt be too sure. I‚Äôm guessing I must have spent around 600 hours on A-level Maths over 2 years.

# Exam Papers

For the majority of my exam papers I sat them in a quiet section of a library to try and emulate exam conditions. I did maybe my first 2 with slightly extra time but after that it was always timed conditions. After marking it, I would add the date to the corresponding cell in my Excel spreadsheet and add a bit of extra info. I highlighted the box green if I got an A\*, yellow if I got an A, and red for anything else. I would add comments to each cell with the mark I got, as well as a list of questions that I got wrong. Any silly mistakes that I made would be added to Anki and / or my note-taking application (Obsidian). Every couple of weeks (more often during Exam season), I would go over the exam questions I got wrong and then put a slash next to them in the cell comment to show that I have answered them right. This meant that by the end I had answered correctly every question that Edexcel had published for Further Maths CP1, CP2, FP1 and FP2. I did try the international papers but found that they didn‚Äôt seem to be as difficult and they missed out large topics. I tried the AS-level papers but I didn‚Äôt have the time to do all of them.

https://preview.redd.it/w6rkpm176jmf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=82a5c08a220af6b322344543412d3bc5684484cf

**Tip:** Print off the specification and highlight parts that you find difficult. It also gives you a full list of formulae that you need to know.

# Keeping track of mistakes

I would either create a flashcard and add it to Anki and / or Obsidian whenever I made a silly mistake or struggled to understand something. That way I would be able to keep track of where I kept going wrong. This made me more thoughtful when answering questions. Before doing past papers or exams I would always do a quick read through of my silly mistakes on Obsidian to prevent them from happening again. I also had a checklist of topics that I was struggling with so I knew what I had to focus on ‚Äì I used this more around exam season. Furthermore, I kept a list of questions that I couldn‚Äôt answer in Obsidian, allowing me to come back later and answer them correctly when I had more knowledge.

**Exam tip:** CUBE the question. Circle command words, underline key points, box sources, and explain in your own words.

# Conclusion

Studying Further Maths alone wasn‚Äôt as difficult as I thought. The key thing is remaining consistent but the content is alright. There were other factors that I feel played a role in my success such as places of study, calculator usage, and exam technique, but I‚Äôve listed out what I think has contributed the most. I did use techniques like the Pomodoro technique (1 hour work, 5 minute break). I feel like I did a lot less work compared to when I did A-level Maths, but you have to consider the fact that when I did study Further Maths I could watch a bunch of content videos really quickly and cover a topic in a few days. In a classroom covering a topic can take a few weeks and it isn‚Äôt as efficient as working by yourself (if you have the ability to do so). It‚Äôs also much easier to get distracted by other people (which isn‚Äôt always a bad thing) in the classroom compared to when studying alone. There are of course lots of benefits that you miss out on by not being in a class like building communication skills and taking part in super-curricular activities.

**TLDR:** Do hard questions, keep track of the ones you get wrong and do them again. Keep track of silly mistakes and review them regularly. Use Anki.

**DISCLAIMER:** This worked for me but might not work for you so try stuff to see if it works and if it doesn‚Äôt, leave it. I had access to a good printer and good libraries which may have given me the edge.

Hope you enjoyed the guide and I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions. Upvote if you found useful.

1n5l4fk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5l4fk,Wi-Fi wasn‚Äôt invented in Silicon Valley. It was an accident from a black-hole experiment.,"üöÄ The technology you use every day was born from a ""failed"" experiment

In the early 1990s, scientists were obsessed with finding black holes. NASA physicist John O'Sullivan built sophisticated equipment to detect signals from evaporating black holes - but found nothing. Zero. Nada.

The experiment was labeled a complete failure. 

But here's where it gets interesting...

That same ""useless"" technology was perfect for something nobody was even thinking about yet - wireless communication. The very equipment that couldn't find black holes became the foundation of Wi-Fi technology that now connects billions of devices worldwide.

This is the power of failed experiments and unexpected discoveries. What we call ""failure"" today might be building tomorrow's breakthrough. Every detour, every ""wrong"" path, every experiment that doesn't go as planned - they're all stepping stones to innovations we can't even imagine yet.

From black hole detection to your morning coffee shop Wi-Fi session. From cosmic disappointment to global connection revolution.

The next time your experiment doesn't work out, remember: you might be accidentally inventing the future.

I also understand that the lower the ppm the better for your machine but your coffee won't be great. Bar de luc will give you well rounded coffee but do you risk buildup pushing through water outside of the LM range?

1n5l3ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1n5l3ca/why_always_me_why_am_i_the_only_responsible/,Why Always Me. Why am I the only responsible person here?,"I'm starting to hate the person I am becoming. I'm the only responsibe one. My husband has become another child I'm responsible for and its been the cause of numerous fights. There has been some but not enough change and I do not like the person I'm becoming because of it.

I am disabled yet even still the vast majority of the responsibility is all on me.

Since becoming a mother and my disability keeping me from work its like my husband slowly expected me to mother him too. Despite my efforts to the contray, talks, argument, here I still am and I'm near my tipping point. All not from lack of trying.

My husband and I have been married 12, been together for 18. He is a genuinely good person, but flawed like any human. I am not perfect either we both make mistakes, we work through them in the beginning. We had a strong bond, but for the last 6 years he is becoming inapt in our relationship.

He went away for a week 3 months ago and my life was drastically less stressful. The house was cleaner, it even smelt better and the kids cried less and in general I had less burden. Overall the house was kept clean, the kids were in better moods and eveything felt easier.

Last year in contrast, which was when I started realising what was happening. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks due to a bad flair up. The house fell apart into chaos and my husband was on the phone to me multiple times a day in a bad mood, and our kids cried down the phone that their Daddy was being mean to them. It was also a point of realisation for me how my husband viewed me as he tried to talk to the doctors to release me because he was stressed despite the doctors being worried I may have a more serious immune disorder.

Since this incident there have been a lot talks and arguments between husband and I and its become repetitive. A week after an argument as eveythinf settles it all goes back to how it was... rinse and repeat.

Then last month something huge happened. I lost my own mother to cancer. And my husband in his own grief forgot it was me who lost my mother... my mother. While watching my sister's husbands check in on them while we planned the funeral and making sure they were ok I barely got a message from him. He wasnt dismissive when I came to him he listened, but it was always me who had to make the first move. I told him this, asked him why after I looked through my phone and realised that everytime he messaged me was only because I messaged him first or I only rang him. He couldn't answer he didn't even realise. It was a heartbreaking revelation when I was already so heartbroken. Not only was it homelife, but it appeared keeping our relationship had become my one sided responsibility.

My husband it appers now quite literally ""needs"" me to tell him what to do, whether intentional or not and its only becoming worse since we had children. Our 6 year old twins are tidier and take more responsibility for their messes including our autistic son, who actually is the first person to usually start cleaning along side me. Our daughter takes a lot of pride in her belongings and bedroom and looks after them, she doesnt make much of a mess to begin with, but she usually is trying to get someone else to clean up after her. I told my husband when he was mad at her as she refused to clean up her toys its because while one child follows one parent by example she is following the other parent by example. Its gotten to the point my kids just come to me and walk past him with their own problems.

Yesterday we fought again, the same argument. I felt taken for granted. While he more so just let me talk, I'll give him credit that he never tries to invalidate my feelings or talk over me. Our fights are often not shouting but more talking in frustration and lots of dialogue, but again its quite one sided. He listens but it feel like he's not truely listening. That he does not take my concerns seriously enough. These days its feels like I am more pleading that arguing.

This time I explained to him that the common living areas are areas we all use, he should be tiding up after himself automatically since he isn't the only one using them. Otherwise he's leaving his mess for someone else to deal with. As we stood in the kitchen I told him the mess he was seeing right now was actually his from earlier because I clean up after myself and the kids are now learning to clean up after themselves and I just clean the rest they can't. I told him he did it after he even saw me just that morning deep clean the kitchen and not even 5 minutes after that did he mess it up. It felt so disrespectful to undo my work, to leave out utensils covered in butter, crumbs everywhere, empty packets left out not rinsed off and put in recycling, spilt sugar all over the counter and coffee stains. It was all his mess. So I left it there until he returned home.

He tried to say he was in a rush. I then said so you are aware, so you left it on purpose knowing I would need to clean it if I needed to use the kitchen (this time I did not clean it). I also asked him why was he looking at tik tok on his phone for 10 minutes if he had been in such a rush. To clean up his mess would have taken him less than 5 minutes and I told him I was not cleaning up his mess because my 5 minutes are not less important than his. He agreed and said he would ""try"".

Great... excellent!

Try isnt enough, his apology is meaningless without action. It more of the same. I need more than try because we have been here before the same argument and nothing has changed.

I told him he wouldn't behave this way if he lived with only housemates. That even this argument was all meaningless if it keeps repeating as he isnt taking responsibility for himself. I told him I loved him but I have my limit. That it feels to me like he thinks so little of me that he knowingly walks over his mess, that he knowingly leaves his dirty clothes everywhere around the house, that he never puts away things after himself and then on top of that needs constant reminders to do the choirs he does everyday, the ones, I am unable to do which can still go undone for days. Even despite reminders. At that point it is just willful.

I told him he needs to take his own responsibility for the sack of our relationship and actually do the things he should be doing by using his eye, not wait for me to tell him. Otherwise I'm not his wife Im his mother. Resuting in completely changing our relationahip dynamic.

I have admitted to him before that Im losing my attraction for him because of this, even though my love for him is still very strong, but this is affecting bedroom dynamics. I retreat when he tries to touch certain areas or intiate sex because he's put me in a position where its becoming more diffcult to see him as a partner, because he expects me to mother him.

I don't accept the excuse of but the mess doesnt bother me either, because if he acted like this with housemates they would be calling him out on it him daily and have kicked him out ages ago for being disrectful of others.

I told him he must think Im responsible for everyone here and either views me like a maid or his mother instead of his wife. As it has gotten to the point that even after he knows the things I can't do like emptying the bins or cleaning the cat litter they still go undone for days.

He must think so little of me that even after I remind him that they need to br done he still doesnt do it. Even to the point these things going undone causes knock on effects like stinking up the house and the cats peeing outside their litter trays in protest. Still it isnt done until I get mad and give out at 12am at night from walking on cat pee in the dark. It keeps still happening like a vicous circle of onsanity.

I try to clean them as best I can do, but it gets to the point where I cant do anything more. I even have to remind him I'm also disabled that I cannot do these things I have told him this so many time. I remind him I show him. Yet it gets to the point where the cats will pee on the ground and I have to clean that up but its happened so often its nos ruined the floor. Which means I have to get that fixed too.

All whilst the house smells like trash because he hasnt taken out the full bins outside and only so much air freshener can mask that.

If I could do these things I would have done them by now then allowing them to continue.

I feel so completely disrespeced. Even my asking goes ignored and I hate the person who Im becoming who is so full of frustration from something so simple as coffee stains on the counter to something problematic as the cats peeing outside their litter trays causing the same reaction in me.

I warned him that one day he would return home to no one if this keeps happening. My love for him is strong but does not mean I will mother or treated like a maid to him. My love will only go so far. How a week of being a good husband after an argument isnt enough, that I need him to do it consistently and constantly.

A husband and wife is a mutual relationship of back and fort give and take not just one person giving and getting nothing in return.

Ultimately I reminded him that I grew up with a strong single mother as a role model, who stayed single for a good reason.",10,1756722348.0,breakingmom,3,1.0,False
