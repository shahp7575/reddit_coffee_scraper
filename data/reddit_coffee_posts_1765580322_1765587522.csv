Welcome back, we got two of three high tiers from the Newspaper Club coming up. I was a bit taken aback by the jumps in power after making the Small City correlation from earlier.

Ruby Tojo

Age: 18 (Rosario + Vampire season II)

Species: Witch = considered the midway between humans and other monsters, Witches have been historically rejected by both for being physically comparable to human beings yet also able to harness the forces of both magic and nature

Description: Born the daughter of two witches who believed in future peace between humans and monster, Ruby's cheerful childhood was robbed from her when a drunk driver claimed their lives. With nowhere else to turn, Ruby would end up at Witch Hill and become the ward of the long-lived Lady Oyakata. Though the two witches would find solace in each other's company, Oyakata's hatred for humanity festered as her ambition for their demise came to fruition. Ruby would come to question these beliefs after befriending fellow witch Yukari Sendo and seeing the peace her parents once spoke of embodied in the Newspaper Club. After Lady Oyakata died with her hatred quelled, Ruby was taken to Yokai Academy since she no longer had a home to return to. Having gained an attraction to Tsukune Aono, Ruby applied for work at Yokai in hopes of finding time to get closer to him.

Feats:

* Served as the apprentice and surrogate daughter of Lady Oyakata after losing her parents to a drunk driver as a kid
   * Despite this isolated homeschooling, Ruby is one of the smartest characters in the series and was introduced as both faster and stronger than Yukari Sendo and Kurumu Kurono combined as a result of her sheer rigorous study
* Is the second enemy of Tsukune Aono and Moka Akashiya to turn herself around and befriend the pair after trying to kill them, as well as the second person in series history to successfully murder Tsukune in cold blood
* After Lady Oyakata's death and failed genocide of humanity, Ruby began working at Yokai Academy as Tenmei Mikogami's assistant despite only being 17 years old
* Prevented Inner Moka from killing Tsukune after he became a Ghoul and went on a murderous rampage, allowing his humanity to be preserved with the Holy Lock
* Assisted Tsukune Aono, Yukari Sendo, Kurumu Kurono, and Mizore Shirayuki in defeating base human Hokuto Kaneshiro after he was caught attacking Yokai's student council, despite being injured from fighting Kiria Yoshii
* Took time during her first winter break at Yokai Academy to improve her magical aptitude and upgraded magic mediums from her original scepter to the Talking Book, a homemade grimoire bound by Lady Oyakata that contains every spell Ruby has ever learned or developed
* Assisted the Newspaper Club in saving Mizore Shirayuki from an arranged marriage by getting into a shootout with Fairy Tale agents, alongside Outer Moka and Kokoa Shuzen
* Participated in the raid on the Floating Garden, fighting through the forces of Fairy Tale to rescue a captive Moka; Ruby was the one to defeat Raika and act as the Newspaper Club's guide through the fortress' basement levels
* Joined the final battle against the all-powerful ancestral vampire Alucard
* Following the death of Yokai Academy's headmaster Tenmei Mikogami, Ruby shares responsibilities in running the school with Nurari the Bus Driver

Personality and Interests:

* Ruby is intelligent, studious, introspective, and open-minded, bearing a sharp wit, incredible memory, and the capacity to broaden her views
   * Ruby was raised under the care of the human-hating witch Lady Oyakata for roughly a decade and was able to reevaluate her views within a day of being shown kindness and coexistence by the Newspaper Club
* While working at Yokai Academy, Ruby is dutiful and diligent with all the tasks given to her by Chairman Mikogami, often dressed for the occasion with a thematically apt attire
   * Ruby sought this job as a pretense for getting closer to Tsukune but has to set this desire aside when there's work to be done
* Being a witch raised in relative isolation, Ruby desired friends above all else and clings mightily to her close relationships, having been overjoyed to meet Yukari Sendo for being a fellow witch, repeatedly implored Lady Oyakata to consider peace when their views began to clash, and repeatedly thrown her life away for the sake of the Newspaper Club, the friends she's finally made
* Ruby has an affinity and love for embroidery, having gone from patchworking her original outfit (worn-out childhood clothes adjusted for her growing body) to handcrafting numerous cosplays and themed outfits for any occasion
* Ruby has a strong affection for Tsukune Aono after his kindness helped remind her of her parents' dream for human-monster coexistence
* Ruby's favorite form of pleasure is being electrocuted, both finding an excuse to include shocking herself as part of Tsukune's training and confessing that she thoroughly enjoyed being near-fatally blasted by Raika's lightning
* When asked what her relation to Tsukune Aono is, she describes herself as his plaything with a heavy implication that she desires being his submissive slave in BDSM
   * Despite being a member of staff at Yokai and being the Newspaper Club's advisor, Ruby has prodded Tsukune to order her around like he's the one with authority between the two of them
   * Not helping matters is Ruby appearing to carry BDSM implements like whips and lit candles on her person to present or utilize with minimal provocation
* Ruby carries a strong belief in dedicating her body and soul to a cause in tandem with strong arousal to feeling pain, her self-degrading masochistic tendencies having freaked out friend and foe alike whenever her professional composure fails
   * Ruby has equated tying herself in shibari with a metal chain to looping a telephone cord around one's finger
   * Ruby is at her most comfortable and erotic when in pain, finding the most enjoyment in electric shocks
* Despite her strait-laced demeanor and elegant authority when carrying herself, Ruby is very sensitive at her core and extremely deferential to those with authority over her
   * While Ruby ultimately stood against Oyakata for the Newspaper Club, Ruby primarily let herself be hurt while tearfully trying to get her mentor to see reason
   * When Inner Moka stole the Belmont whip, Ruby was left weeping in fear of letting Mikogami down and begged the other girls for help getting it back
* Ruby is bold and shameless in equal measure, having used her body getting shocked as a unit of measurement for Tsukune's mastery of Yoki control, swayed Tsukune into walking her around school on a dog leash, dressed in a revealing slingkini while working at a beach inn, and, by series end, revealed that she regularly wears leather ""sex-slave"" lingerie under her normal attire when trying to deliver urgent news
* Ruby is also a capable gardener, as she tended to the sunflowers of Witch Hill and helped Lady Oyakata nurture the armies of Garigarian and Hanabake plant monsters they intended to use for their revenge against humanity
* Ruby seems to have a strong connection to crows as she commanded a flock of them to harass the Newspaper Club long before using the Talking Book to create artificial crow familiars for battle
* Whenever crisis arises, Ruby is usually the one to take charge and develop a game plan for any given situation
   * When Tsukune went into a rampage while fighting the Phantom Thief, Ruby prioritized finding a way to suppress the rampant ghoul before he could be a danger beyond the current criminal hunt at hand
   * During the raid on the Hanging Garden, Ruby was the one to rationalize that rushing down to Moka was the team's best shot at success because Gyokuro holding a rally on the surface level meant most of Fairy Tale's forces were gathered up top and had to follow them down
* After years of rigorous study, Ruby is highly knowledgeable in magic and various artifacts, allowing her to undo select curses, master forbidden arts, and reverse-engineer magic circles made by other mystics on the fly
* Though kind, composed, and polite, Ruby was also once a ruthless and pragmatic killer who could slice through a human torso while targeting all their organs in a single swipe
   * Ruby's victory over Raika demonstrates that she's still capable of this brutality and more, despite her personal growth
* Despite being under the age of 20 by series end, Ruby is a competent enough to act as a certified substitute teacher and appears to largely run Yokai Academy's affairs after Chairman Mikogami's untimely passing

Standard Equipment:

* Grimoire = a magic book that was bound by Lady Oyakata's hand, containing transcriptions of every spell and familiar Ruby has ever produced along with extra pages to write new ones in
* Magic Staff = a metallic staff with a purple gem as its magic conduit, allowing her to perform magic
* Witch Salve = a magical ointment that supports healing to where its applied; Moka implies that Ruby carries or can readily produce a means of treating the injured when they reunite on the Hanging Garden, which is likely this item
* BDSM gear = accessories used by Ruby to express love by inflicting pain; the extent of what Ruby regularly carries is unclear, but she's shown to own at least a pair of handcuffs with a lengthy chain, a lit candle and two whips
* Belmont = a thorny whip once held by a legendary monster hunter and kept in Tenmei Mikogami's personal collection of magic artifacts, doubles as a reference to Castlevania and Simon Belmont in particular; the whip conducts Yoki like electricity and nullifies magic with simple contact from any part of it but the handle
   * the magic disruption is so potent that it even cancels out magic artifacts held by its target; Moka simply grabbing the whip or wrapping it around her leg completely disabled her rosary

Attack Potency: At least Small City, likely far higher with the Iron Maiden

* Ruby's go-to attack of magically creating birds and blowing them up like bombs can blow up large tendrils of Alucard at a level of devastation that rivals the mighty Akasha Bloodriver's kicks

Speed: At least Supersonic+, higher using the Iron Maiden, with Massively Hypersonic reactions

* Was cleanly faster than Kurumu Kurono and Yukari Sendo together when they first met
* Can casually move faster than Mach 3 after training in Hong Kong for a month
* While wearing the Iron Maiden armor, Ruby can move like a blur in comparison to people capable of Mach 3 and boasts the reflexes to tag beings like Raika, who can literally move like lightning

Striking Strength: At least Small City with the Iron Maiden

* Hurt Fairy Tale's Raika with a punch, albeit superficially; performing the Seraphic Feather attack to impale Raika incessantly defeated him in on the spot

Lifting Strength: At least Class 5, likely Class 25 with partial transformation magic and the Iron Maiden

* Ruby has previously tied herself up in both a whip and measuring tape too tight and too well to break herself out, so this rating is for her magical means of offense
* Physically dragged Kurumu Kurono kicking and screaming into a school bus without her magic
* Ruby's corvid feathers from her partial transformation can be used to hold and restrain things with at least as much effectiveness as the raw strength of more physical monsters like Kurumu and Mizore
* Ruby's feather tendrils have successfully tied up a pre-Hong Kong Kokoa Shuzen, who is highly regarded for her freakish strength by even vampire standards

Durability: At least Small City level

* Survived being impaled by Lady Oyakata's Hanabake Fusion, which could hurt Inner Moka
* No-sold being struck full force in the abdomen by the Phantom Thief, a doppelganger, using Tsukune Aono's original human body, which could break the bones of humans and monsters alike
* Took both physical blows and electric shocks from Raika of Fairy Tale, who embodies and manipulates lightning
* Survived an attack from Kuyo of Fairy Tale meant to kill Tsukune

Range: Up to Tens of Meters

Abilities:

* Magic Skills and Spells = Witches are able to draw from nature itself to command magical powers with the use of a medium held on their person
   * Simple telekinesis = Ruby uses magic to manipulate nearby objects, though she primarily levitates her grimoire in front of her face for easier reading and casting instead of any combat applications
   * Transformation Magic = Ruby changes her body into another form, though she mainly either turns into a crow or grows a set of six black or white corvid wings; Ruby can furthermore turn the individual feathers on her wings into malleable sharp blades or restrictive non-conductive ribbons to attack from odd angles
   * Curse dispel = Ruby can dispel magic curses
   * ""Demon Wall"" = A joint spell with Yukari Sendo, Yukari plants her tarot cards in a circle around a subject before the witch duo channel their magic and recite an incantation together that suppresses out of control Yoki; this seal was once cast to quell the vampire blood in Tsukune Aono's body after he turned into a ghoul and went on a rampage
   * Talking Book = Ruby can magically produce the spells in her grimoire into bookmarks at any quantity she desires and then convert said bookmarks into whatever spells were previously inscribed upon them as an intermediary
   * Grimoire summons = Ruby can perform mass summons from the spells held in her Grimoire using Talking Book, which range from plants (like Garigarians and Hanabake, man-eating plant monsters with the density of steel) to insects (to potentially reproduce the summons Fang-Fang and Yukari are capable of) to birds (namely crows) by using bookmarks
   * Grimoire conjuring = Ruby can also use Talking Book to produce tools, materials, and other objects ranging from pebbles and clay to aluminum powder in any density or distribution she chooses at the same rates she can produce her summoned ""friends""
   * Chain Magic = a spell Ruby can use to turn any number of objects called by Talking Book back into a bookmark and then into another spell eligible for Talking Book from her Grimoire, acting as a limited form of matter manipulation that can even change an object while it's being actively destroyed; Ruby once used this spell to convert flocks of several hundred crows at once into their collective weight in aluminum powder to cause a dust explosion
   * Greatest Forbidden High-Ranking Bondage Spell - Iron Maiden = a magic suit of armor that forces the wearer's body to dramatically boost all physical parameters and comes with two massive angelic wings and extremities capable of telescoping or expanding at will; in exchange for the sheer physical power it provides, the Iron Maiden will crush the wearer hard enough to juice their blood while causing severe internal damage like snapping tendons and tearing muscles at alarming rates for each motion they make while wearing in it
   * Iron Maiden, Attack Form! Seraphic Feather! = Ruby turns the detrimental aspects of the Iron Maiden upon her opponent by reverting the armor into a series of white ribbons to bind and crush them, whereupon Ruby uses the feathers from Iron Maiden's wings to impale her target en masse while they're bound

Weaknesses:

* As a witch, Ruby is reliant upon a magical conduit to channel her magic; taking away both her scepter and grimoire therefore renders her defenseless
* Ruby is a masochist at heart and takes delight in being hurt on many highly inappropriate occasions, taking the most delight in electrocution
* Ruby's magic, while highly versatile and easy to spam, is largely limited to what's contained in her grimoire and can take time to cast
* Iron Maiden is suicidally dangerous to Ruby's own body and can cause so much agony that not even her masochistic tendencies can find bliss in the internal damage it inflicts
* Belmont can be turned against her and subsequently lock out her access to magic
* While Ruby is one of the only two members of the Newspaper Club who can provide healing, they're slow acting in nature and surface level in their effectiveness; thus, Ruby's healing methods work best between battles and can only close up serious injuries instead of outright undoing them

Kokoa Shuzen

Age: 16 (Rosario + Vampire season II)

Species: Vampire = the most elite of elite monster races, Vampires are touted as among the mightiest creatures around for their supreme natural beauty, burning life energies and incredible mastery of Yoki with which they channel to bolster their physical parameters; to offset their incredible power, Vampires are known to be prideful and deceptive to a fault and are burdened with weaknesses to water and silver crosses

Description: Born the second daughter of Gyokuro Shuzen, Kokoa was cast aside by her own mother and constantly outshined by her three older sisters. The young ginger grew fondest of her half-sister Moka for spending time with her and strove to surpass her, developing incredible strength by even vampire standards and broad mastery of various weapons to chase this goal. Even after Moka left home after her tenth birthday, Kokoa would doggedly keep on the pursuit with her pet monster bat Kou-chan at her side. Kokoa would finally find out that Moka attends Yokai Academy but would have to make peace with the reality of the sister she admired being sealed behind a magic rosary, no longer the proud warrior she coveted. Under the eventual tutelage of proud lolicon and black belt karate master Haiji Miyamoto, Kokoa would finally come into her own as a fighter beyond her sheer strength and stand proudly alongside her other sisters.

Feats:

* Was born the second daughter of Issa Shuzen and his wife Gyokuro, having the high privilege of familial ties to the strongest vampire lineage and greatest assassins in all of Japan if not the whole world
* Caught and carried the monster bat Kou-chan as a gift for her half-sister Moka Akashiya's birthday
* Though not as accomplished or skilled as her three older sisters, Kokoa is a formidable fighter and well-rounded multi-melee weapons expert
   * When introduced, Kokoa's full power Yoki was remarked as comparable to Inner Moka's despite still being the weaker of the two
* Spent at least thirteen minutes fighting off Yokai Academy's Karate Club, a squad of thuggish late-teens black belts, alone while disarmed and de-aged to a preteen
* Beat up Ginei Morioka with the help of Kurumu Kurono and Mizore Shirayuki
   * A gag feat due said beating coming after the would-be battle being called off
* Assisted the Newspaper Club in saving Mizore Shirayuki from an arranged marriage by getting into a shootout with Fairy Tale agents, alongside Outer Moka and Ruby Tojo
* Grew tremendously in power and skill after training in Karate under Haiji Miyamoto for a month in Hong Kong
* Participated in the raid on the Floating Garden as part of the second group, alongside Ginei Morioka, Haiji Miyamoto, Ling-Ling Huang, and Touhou Fuhai
* Fought and defeated her older sister Kahula in her half-sealed state singlehanded and was also the one to kill Kahlua after she fully unsealed her powers
   * Kahlua is a world-class assassin and cleanly stronger than Inner Moka without her Shinso Vampire powers, having previously defeated Moka while only in her half-sealed state
   * Kokoa needed help from Kurumu Kurono and Mizore Shirayuki to overcome Kahlua's full power form
* Joined the final battle against the all-powerful ancestral vampire Alucard
* Kokoa officially became an item with Haiji, becoming the first and only member of the Newspaper Club to enter a romantic relationship
   * This is extra remarkable because Kokoa has been the least interested in romance out of the whole club and was only in her first year of high school

Personality and Interests:

* Despite her high opinion of herself and vampires in general, Kokoa is shown to be act warm, kind, and approachable in general as she was introduced saving Tsukune from a wild animal attack and was later shown getting along with several upperclassmen in casual social interaction
* Kokoa can be energetic and bullheaded, which sometime leads to her being pushy and oblivious like in how she wildly misinterpreted the personality change from Inner Moka to Outer Moka for nearly seven years
   * Was known to be the troublemaker among her sisters up to the age of nine
* Kokoa is also prideful as any other vampire and expresses that she'd much rather be humiliated or brutally beaten in battle than be coddled or ignored for her youthful looks, as best reflected by her embarrassing first encounter with Haiji
   * This appears to stem from continuous teasing from her older sisters Kahlua and Akua in her childhood in tandem with low expectations from her mother while she was growing up
* Kokoa holds extreme admiration of her half-sister Moka for being the one to give her regular attention and spar with her frequently, being repulsed by her Outer Moka persona's aversion and ineptitude towards combat but willing to coach and fight her to draw out Inner Moka until she learned better
   * To this end, Kokoa has previously expressed envy and annoyance towards Tsukune Aono for earning Moka's growing affection and even direct coaching on how to fight from her
* In part to low self-worth and having to live in the shadow of her prodigal three older sisters, Kokoa is determined to prove herself as their peer and subsequently driven to one day defeat Moka at her full strength despite hundreds of crushing defeats littering their shared childhood
   * Kokoa even once professed her fear that Moka would disown her for being too weak to challenge her
   * Kokoa has also eagerly pounced on opportunities to hang out with Kahlua and Akua in hopes of expanding her combat repertoire with them
   * Kokoa has also admitted to developing a deep-rooted self hatred as a result of distance and neglect imposed between herself and Kahlua by Gyokuro, saddled with a vacuous sense of envy of their ability
* Kokoa shares a kinship with Yukari Sendo after bonding over being regularly underestimated by their young looks as well as common perverted interests like big boobs and Boys Love manga
* Kokoa is sensitive to perverse and carnal matters, especially if sprung on her suddenly, and will frequently suffer nosebleeds as she struggles to compose herself
* Kokoa is a bit of a brat with shades of being an oujo-sama archetype, which reflects in her general impatience and extravagant twin pigtails (a symbol and privilege of beautiful noble girls, according to her entry in the Official Yokai Gakuen Guide Book)
* Kokoa is fond of fighting and tends to bore easily during periods of peace, reveling in dating Haiji Miyamoto as their dates consist of them fighting full force on a daily basis
   * Kokoa seems to preoccupy herself with daytime naps and reading manga during such periods of downtime
* Though annoyed by Haiji's lolicon antics, Kokoa has grown to love him after he built her confidence, trained her to new heights of power, and helped her overcome her extreme fear of her own mother and sister
* Kokoa is keen uphold a strong image of herself and will thus try in vain to hide her sweet tooth from others, which includes tolerating coffee with extra milk and acting distant from potential friends to come off more mature
* On the note of Kokoa's sweet tooth, she's been seen enjoying melon soda, soft serve ice cream, and Kurumu's homemade cookies
* Kokoa has much greater discipline regarding sucking blood than either of Moka's personas, who are both hopelessly addicted to Tsukune; Kokoa herself had also previously sampled Tsukune's blood and has completely abstained from drinking him despite confessing to how notably tasty it is
* Kokoa holds a vehement dislike of being electrocuted, sharing this reaction in common with Kurumu Kurono
* Kokoa is a talented multi-melee weapons master as she's trained for years in the use of various weapons to hopefully overcome Moka, even before getting Kou-chan as her pet and battle companion
* Kokoa is sometimes prone to going to extremes to achieve a goal, like setting up a gambit to hook up Tsukune with Kurumu before abruptly picking a fight with Ruby, Yukari, Mizore, and Outer Moka at the same time for hours straight to buy Kurumu some time to cement their bond
* Kokoa has also demonstrated sharp senses and a keen wit, as she's sensed an unseen Haiji spying on her during measurements day and was the one to figure out the exact mechanics of a full-powered Kahlua's ultimate attack
* When taken off her guard and overwhelmed in battle, Kokoa's resolve is quick to falter, and her doubts wildly impede her ability to maintain poise
   * This appears to be a form of mental regression as Kokoa was constantly treated with kid gloves and made to feel small by the rest of the Shuzen clan in her youth
* Kokoa's skill level and proper form dramatically rose after training with Haiji Miyamoto for a month, which should imply newfound aptitude for karate after the fact
* Kokoa's deepest and greatest wish is for her sisters to one day all get along, as she loves them all deeply despite diverging life paths, differing parentage, and her own envy of them
   * Kokoa would break down in tears and admit to as much after being the one to put down Kahlua in battle

Standard Equipment:

* Kou-chan = a shapeshifting monster bat that Kokoa caught in the wild as a tenth birthday gift for Moka Akashiya, which weighs 100 kg at all times and has been trained to turn into whatever weapon or other handheld analogue device Kokoa desires; Kou-chan is also capable of flight and writing on small signs, additionally making him an effective scout and messenger for Kokoa
   * Axe = a weapon Kokoa used prior to getting Kou-chan, which he should be able to turn into; Kokoa has used both a large axe and a smaller double-sided one
   * Spear = an ornate double-helix shaft tipped with a pointed blade on one end used for precise impalement attacks
   * Morningstar = Kokoa's go-to weapon in the early series, which she swings around to crush her opponent
   * Sledgehammer = a large rectangular block hammer with a spike protruding from the two smaller sides to bludgeon and impale
   * Spiked Club = an edgy baseball bat Kokoa swings around to indulge her bloodlust
   * Serrated Cleaver = a blade that eclipses Kokoa herself in size, being curved on one side and flat but serrated on the other
   * Knuckle Dusters = wraps around Kokoa's fist and lines her forearm to boost her punching power and reinforce her forearm's guard
   * Club Hammer = a weapon, resembling twin stone blocks on a stick, Kokoa used prior to getting Kou-chan, which he should be able to turn into
   * Katana = shown in the season II Volume 2 theatre, never used
   * Rapier = a thin and light blade for thrusting that Kokoa uses when she's pursuing a speedy offense against faster opponents
   * Double-Bladed Sword = a jagged sword that branches into a pair of thin blades that look akin to a tuning fork, having a loose resemblance to the Shin-Gunto Type 95 - NCO Swords Middle Model
   * Bo Staff = a humble cylindrical stick used for double-ended blunt force melee
   * Parasol = used to shield Kokoa from the sun and projectiles like water jets while under the summer sun
   * Naginata = a Japanese slashing spear Kokoa deployed when confronted by Kahlua at the Village of the Yuki-onna
   * Cleaver = a sword resembling a cleaver that is nearly as long as Kokoa is tall, its size being useful for intercepting onslaughts of frontal attacks and enabling Kokoa to put her full weight behind precision power strikes
   * Cutlass = a long sword with a guarded hilt and a perfectly straight blade that Kokoa uses for decisive impalement
   * Dust Bin = Kou helps Kokoa rake leaves during the autumn by shrinking his main body and turning his tail into a dust bin from her to guide the leaves into
   * Short Sword = Ko-chan's first ever transformation, a curved blade that best resembles an Army Commissioned Officers Shin-Gunto Type 98 or Bonguk Beom of exaggerated width
   * True Form = Kou-chan's true form is that of an eldritch flower with tentacles for stems, rows of toothy spikes lining his petals, and his two bat wings acting as leaves on the stem, which he uses to envelope and snare prey before reverting to his cuter form to digest his food; Kou-chan refrains from showing this form to Kokoa for some reason and only reverts when hunting spiders he finds appetizing

Attack Potency: At least City level, likely Mountain level

* Kokoa's Yoki when going all out has been directly compared to that of Inner Moka as far back as her debut
* Defeated a half-sealed Kahlua Shuzen in single combat, a feat even Inner Moka failed to accomplish
* Trained in Karate under Haiji Miyamoto for a month in Hong Kong and continues to fight him on a regular basis as their idea of a romantic date
   * The same Haiji Miyamoto, with Ginei Morioka's help, punched a hole through Alucard's true body, which has this level of durability, in his human guise

Speed: At least Supersonic+, likely far higher

* Is an equal in speed to Inner Moka and a half-sealed Kahlua, who far exceed the casual Mach 3 most of the Newspaper Club is capable of
* Fights on regular basis with Haiji Miyamoto, a karate master crow tengu who can keep up in battle with Ginei Morioka, one of the two primary speedster characters of the Rosario + Vampire setting

Striking Strength: At least City level, likely Mountain level

* Physically superior to Kahlua Shuzen, managing to break and sever her dominant arm's wing blades with even her sloppiest sword swings

Lifting Strength: At least Class 25+

* Kokoa is regarded as notably strong by even vampire standards, proven by her ability to casually carry her monster bat Kou-chan (who weighs 100 kg) since before she turned nine years old
* Should be far stronger than the average Jiang-Shi, who can lift 500 kg based on their species-wide strength being compared to bears
* Matched muscle with her older sister Kahlua in sword combat; Kahlua is decisively stronger than Inner Moka without her First Ancestor powers
   * Inner Moka is stronger than Tsukune Aono, who lifted a fledgling phoenix

Durability: At least City level, likely Mountain level

* Even before hitting her stride as a fighter, Kokoa could walk off casual kicks from Inner Moka and survive attempts on her life by a fully suppressed Kahlua
* Was fit to walk after withstanding a full force hit from the Phantom Thief, a doppelgänger with full mastery of every martial art in the world, after he took the form of Inner Moka, though she confesses to being too weak to fight back anymore
* Took hits from her older sister Kahlua in her half-sealed and full power forms
* Regularly spars with Haiji Miyamoto, a crow tengu karate master capable of hurting Alucard, after they started dating

Range: Standard Melee range, Extended Melee range to Tens of Meters with Kou-chan

Abilities:

* Healing Factor = One of the many blessings of being a Vampire, Kokoa possesses a potent healing factor that allows her to shake off injuries better than even most other monsters and fight on in peak condition again given even the briefest respite in the heat of battle
   * A pre-Hong Kong Kokoa was able to get back on her feet within a minute of the Phantom Thief hitting her full force in the guise of Inner Moka, though even she concedes she still wasn't fit to fight at that point
   * Kokoa at her peak was able to press on fighting Kahlua even after she removed both her limiters, continuing to bounce back from direct hits of her blood shotgun attack while already exhausted and bleeding from her head
* Vampire Physiology =Kokoa, as a vampire, is blessed with supernaturally good looks and a human-like body that surpasses most monster races in most physical parameters, though this comes largely to down mastery over Yoki
   * Kokoa is also an outlier in this respect as she's regarded as supernaturally strong by even vampire standards, such that even her three sisters all concede to being outdone by Kokoa in terms of sheer brute force
* Yoki mastery = Vampires can produce large quantities of Yoki and harness it to vastly bolster their physical parameters (strength, durability, and speed) to the point that they're regarded as stronger than physically inclined monsters like orcs, cyclopes, and trolls despite possessing less muscle mass
   * Vampires can also project their Yoki as show of force, the means of which include visible auras that rip things apart on contact, pillars of light, masses of bat-like effigies, and charging up body parts with electricity
* Hax resistance = Vampires and First Ancestors are notably resistant to having their bodies and minds tampered with, though not to an infallible extent
   * Both Outer Moka and a weakened Inner Moka were only partially and slowly petrified by the Medusa-inspired bites of Hitomi Ishigami's snake hairs, with a fully powered Inner Moka even breaking off her stone transformation at will; a still human Tsukune was turned to stone almost instantly with less bites
   * Moka was able to fight the influence of Mako Yakumaru's bodily fluids, which turn the afflicted into shambling husks that mindlessly obey her every whim once injected into their system; Outer Moka struggled to resist Mako's bidding while Inner Moka impaled herself to induce a sharp pain that broke the control
   * When exposed to Lilith's Mirror, a cursed artifact that exposes the true form of monsters reflected in it and compels them to act on their greatest desires or base instincts, Inner Moka was able to resist her attraction to Tsukune to address the problem at hand but fell victim to a vampiric compulsion to say hurtful things she didn't mean to him while under its influence
* Power Detector = an upgrade to the Yoki senses innate in all monsters, Vampires can use their Yoki like sonar waves to feel out sources of Yoki or killing intent from other monsters with far greater effectiveness than conventional senses; this power will cause the user to perceive unseen attacks and assailants as white balls of light (their intensity reflecting the killing intent and power behind a given attack) as they approach, allowing them to react more efficiently
   * Use of this ability has allowed Moka to catch attacks while her back was turned with casual ease and enabled Tsukune to fight a battle while blind and deaf

Weaknesses:

* As a Vampire, Kokoa bears weaknesses to clear water (holy water moreso) and silver
   * Water causes Yoki to escape a Vampire's body as painful electrical discharges, greatly hampering their ability to produce and channel Yoki for as long as their body remains wet; mixing, polluting, or otherwise diluting the contents of water in a liquid eliminates this effect
   * Contact with silver suppresses the power of a Vampire to a limited degree for as long as it is maintained; Moka, Kahlua, and Gyokuro all deliberately wore silver crosses as a power limiter
   * Other traditional weaknesses like sunlight, crosses, and garlic have been acknowledged but dismissed as negligible in comparison to the above
* Kokoa bears deep insecurities and a fragile ego, so any major setbacks tend to rattle her into an emotional regression before her love of battle can settle in
   * The chances of this working by end of series have greatly diminished thanks to the coaching and encouragement of Haiji Miyamoto
* Kokoa is closeted pervert with an appreciation for the female form, so any exposure to female fanservice or boys love is liable to shake her composure and induce nose bleeds
   * Kokoa is generally firm about not letting this unbalance her during battle, as she kept a cool enough head after seeing Kurumu's bare boobs during the skirmishes against the Phantom Thief
* Keeping Kou-chan from Kokoa locks her out of her weapons options
   * This weakness is downplayed as Kokoa is a skilled enough fighter to hold her own against a mob of karate black belts for over 13 minutes bare fisted even prior to her training with Haiji

Glad to through with these two, they had a lot more to offer than I first thought. I would've loved to get through with just one more part, but the character cap strikes again. So I'll need find a way to get the next three characters down in two parts and keep it a little extra interesting since there's some redundancy.

1pl83pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1pl83pq/what_just_happened_24_hour_fight_like_forking_a/,What just happened? 24 hour fight like forking a grape.,"Something happened that I need advice on. Apologize for the length but there’s a lot of context. 

I am a Female (45) dating male (49) for 14 months and I have a son (18) who has been studying abroad as a freshman and this is his first time back since September. He and my son get along very well. He tells me all the time what a good mother I am and what a good kid my son is. And he is for the most part other than being a moody teen. 

Yesterday my partner and I picked up my son from the airport. One of my son’s friends from high school drove with us meeting my partner and I at a nearby location to travel in the same car. The plan was for my son and his friend to return to the friend’s car where they would go catch up and visit with other friends while my partner and I killed time in the city until we picked up my son from said friends home. Of note I no longer live in the city where my son graduated and now reside about 1 hour away. 

My son calls as my partner and I are headed to shop and ask if he can spend the night with said friend and the friend drive him back to the suburbs the following day and if I could also  bring the suitcase to the friend’s house, friend’s house being near the shops partner and I are going to. As in two blocks. 

I relay this to my partner as my son is texting me in real time and my partner becomes angry saying, “I knew he would do this and you would cave and I am not bringing him his suitcase due to his poor planning” and words to that context. I suppose my parenting style is more relaxed and my thoughts were as long as my son has a safe way back home since I didn’t want him driving jet lagged, I saw no problem with him taking time to be with friends. I remember being 18 and wanting to catch up and how that goes and we had no plans but to chill at the house anyway. I get my son and his friend to just meet us at the shops to get the baggage. No problem they comply so we don’t have to even go the two blocks away. 

At that point my partner said, “I told my whole family that you would do this” and “of course I will look like the bad guy” and “you are the reason your son is the way he is”. This was all very hurtful and not helpful at all but I finally settled him down and thought we came to some resolution but he would rekindle the anger and kept rehashing it getting somewhat calm then cycling back to belligerent. Anyway it ended up a 5 hour spiral of hashing and rehashing the same scenario. Resolution would be made and he would start back up until I was exhausted. I would get confused to the point I didn’t even know what the original problem was and he would monologue and then say I wasn’t listening or comprehending but I was strung out from the barrage. The litany of it all and the fact it was nothing I could really answer to. I finally go to bed because I can’t stay up any longer as this argument kept on the entire drive back and then some. 

Flash forward to this morning. I wake up because he is crying and I ask what is wrong and he says, “is this where I loose you”? I try to be supportive and reassuring and we get up and have coffee and he low key starts jabbing at me about being cold and wearing a sweater in a 70 degree house. Weird. I play along with it and honestly  can’t recall what was said next because it was such a nothing burger in the chiding banter when suddenly he gets up and says, “ I am going to just be quite”. He was definately terse and touchy. Just disagreeable and rather than joking good naturedly, there was an annoyed tone I sensed. 

This is where it gets even more baffling. I proceed to go shower to get ready for work and when I get out of the shower he is gone. Nowhere in sight in the house. Also it’s totally out of character for him to leave that early, take a walk in the cold, or even go outside period. So I was weirded out. I text him and say how I can’t believe he just left without telling me goodbye. No answer. I then remember to check the back and go open my garage where I can see his car is still parked on the back drive but he isn’t in it. I come back into the house from the garage and at the same time he comes in the front door and launches into me about my text accusing him of not saying goodbye and always jumping to conclusions and he just went out to get some air. I tell him I didn’t really jump to a totally illogical conclusion because he never goes out that early to do anything. So me thinking he left was as logical as me thinking he went out to stand in the freezing morning air but that I am sorry I made the wrong assumption. He goes on to say I always act on my emotions and don’t think things through, assume the worst, and maybe I should have opened the garage first and checked to see if his car was there. Idk but the outrage sure didn’t seem to fit because it was a misunderstanding. But he would not accept my apology or attempts at descalation, kept moving the goal post of the argument, and said my apology was insincere. Finally he storms out yelling “bye”. 

So with all that being said, my issue is that I almost feel that he was baiting me the whole morning and intentionally went outside while I was in the shower only entering when he heard the garage door close. He knew that was the time to come back in. Idk. Maybe I do jump to conclusions.  There was just something weird about how it went down. How he didn’t just answer my text and say I am standing outside. How he was pissy about me wearing a sweater like an old lady. The whole morning it seemed like he wanted to start a fight. 

By the time I finish getting ready I have the first of many text rehashing the same issue of me chronically jumping to conclusions but also vague other nebulous complaints  I couldn’t really grasp. It was all specifically non specific  complaints and nothing really earth shaking, just human err. I apologized for jumping to conclusions but saying this is probably something I will do again. I will often be wrong and make errors in judgement because that’s baked into being human. He kept saying emotions had no part in this and feelings are wrong. He would not accept anything. It felt very targeted. 

The entire day he would  text me long diatribes saying the same thing, same loop. Nothing made much sense and I could not deescalate him or console him or reason with him. It was exhausting yet again like yesterday 2.0 but now he would flat out tell me he didn’t say things he had just texted me. And he is saying I have made him feel crazy by questioning his sanity. After the 20th text I asked him if he was well, as in okay. Wrong thing. He then went ballistic and started saying I made him feel crazy and he was getting his sister to check him into the hospital because he needed to know if he was crazy. He says he isn’t doing well, hasn’t had a full night sleep in days, is exhausted from driving back and fourth to my house (which I do not make him do) but I can’t imagine how these rather small things could have done this. He says he loves me and can’t live without me and at the same time hammers me for changing plans according to my son and jumping to conclusions that are not totally illogical either. 

He then goes on to say his sister, who is a therapist, says we will not work out without the therapy. My thing is, how can I get therapy over human things like jumping to conclusions and being flexible with plans? Sometimes I am the queen of the world and he crows my praises to an uncomfortable level and am the worlds best mother and now I am discarded to the bottom of the barrel of humans and the relationship is trash and needs help. And these things have never been an issue until he hit me with this yesterday. 

I am gobsmacked. It makes no sense that this man who was crying in the wee hours about loosing me has simultaneously unleashed on me. His complaints were not me cheating or lying, just everyday human error I can’t really stop because I’m human.  I have never in my life been involved in a 24 hour long argument and can’t imagine such everyday issues have upended a relationship I thought, up until yesterday, was going well. I feel exhausted, bereaved, and like the rug was pulled from under me. 

Any insight on what could be going on in a situation like this would be appreciated. ",2,1765586563.0,datingoverforty,7,1.0,False

1pl83cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pl83cd/i_want_to_give_up_but_i_cant/,"I want to give up, but I can't","Dear kiddo,

This has been one of the longest, hardest months of my life. It shouldn't be this way. It never has been. Every other breakup has been relatively painless. I barely felt a thing when my eight-year relationship ended, but this is different. It hurts more. It's more confusing.

Perhaps I felt nothing because those relationships had already fizzled and faded before we broke up. The spark had died, so there was nothing to miss. It's one thing not to feel the need to mourn a relationship that died long ago. It's another to break up with someone you still love and are in love with.

And it's torturous to know that person still loves and is in love with you. 

Adding to the suffering is that we agree love isn't enough, no matter how deep our connection was and still is. The tragedy is that our bond is so strong, it keeps us locked into this thing and hurting each other. 

Even now, we struggle to stay broken up. Neither of us can maintain no contact for more than a week. Last weekend, when we ""backslid"" again and hooked up, you asked me if we should get back together. 

Your head was in a bad way, so I told you we should wait and think on it some more. Truthfully, I didn't know what I wanted. I'm uncertain if I want this to end or continue. Either way, I just know I don't want to feel this way anymore. 

And when we were together last weekend, it felt great at times, but also empty, like we were going through the motions. We were doing our routine. Sex, spooning, coffee, breakfast, etc. It was nice, yet hollow. It was like a nicotine patch for our relationship: something to help wean us off the stuff but never quite as satisfying as the real thing.  

At the same time, I was reminded why I fell in love with you. How sweet and strange and beautiful you are. How easy it is to be around you. How right it feels to kiss you in that tender spot just below your earlobe. 

Still, I tried to steel my resolve to quit you for good. I thought about all the ways I felt unfulfilled in the relationship and went over every fight in my head. But I just can't cast you as the villain in our story, even though it would make it easier to move on and forget about you. 

I feel as though I'm at war with myself. On an intellectual level, I understand why things probably won't work between us — at least without some significant changes. However, emotionally, I can't stop loving you or wanting to be with you.

And I don't know how to square that circle.

I am using a different account for this as I am slightly embarrassed.

I am 16M and I live in a part of the UK and I have gotten to know this girl who was new to my school this year. I overthink a lot of things.

We met through mutual friends and that is how we started to talk. She is half Kazakh and lived in my country for 10 years before moving away, coming back to our country this year. 

We both share a Russian class in school, she speaks fluent Russian as her mum is Kazakh and taught her as a child, I have basic conversations with her in Russian and we have fun speaking it together in general. She teaches me things and we joke about the Russian literature we study and joke about the quirkiness of our teacher.

We both get the train to and from school and walk together to the train station. The first time we spoke was when our mutual friend left and we were walking in the rain under her umbrella. The mood was very good and she was smiling often. I genuinely enjoyed it. And I Genuinely enjoy her company.

We started snapping eachother on Snapchat and messing about with filters, nothing serious and in general always light-hearted we chatted a lot too but never prolonged chats. Usually messages every now and then on most days. Recently it has increased to chatting everyday online. However her reply times have always been relatively slow which I didn't think much of. One of my friends I told this to didn't think it meant much either. Just that she had other things to be doing which is exactly the same for me as I am the captain of my team in the sport I play and train about 6 times a week. 

However one time she asked me if I had Snapchat plus which I don't, so I asked her ""why do you ask?"" and she said one of her friends got offended she half swiped them which is a way of reading a message without the other person knowing you've read it and all it tells them is that it's delivered. This makes me wonder if this means she does this to me. I'm not sure if this means she cares and wants to not feel pressured to respond or if she doesn't know how to reply and would feel bad leaving it opened or responding dryly. In general she's always happy to see me as she smiles at me and laughs at some of my jokes which are not all that funny. If I told some of those to other people they would not be impressed.

When we're walking together we tend to walk quite close together and often accidentally touch arms / shoulders. We tend to tease eachother too but nothing more than just a bit of banter.

Our mutual friend is a boy who is also new to our school this year. However they didn't know eachother previously. He is solid and I get on well with him too. He sometimes gets the train home but never in the morning so I tend to be alone with her in the mornings.
They do not like eachother. I know this because people make fun of them because they think they'd make a good couple however the teasing annoyed them and they both talked to me about how this is annoying to them. They definitely are just friends. However they have hung out together alone on a weekend in town. This was before I really talked to them both. 

On Instagram she added me to her close friends list and a green ring appeared around her story meaning she'd picked me to be on that list. (You probably already know what this means if you use the internet)

Recently she talked about how she saw food from the chicken place near our school and said how she wanted to go. She said several times that she wanted to go here. I took this as a hint and thought about it that day.

I knew we had winter mock exams and our last exam was on the same day at the same time, so I asked her to go there with me after the last exam. I said this in Russian and she confirmed what I meant in English to which she instantly said yes but added she'd have to ask her mum.

Everything was normal and she told me her mum said she could go.

The day before we had the exam she texted me asking where we go between exams (we both had 2 on the same day) so I said we could go to the sixth form centre study floor. She said she was thinking about going to a coffee shop or something to which I thought was her asking me to spend more time with her so I said I'd come with her if she'd like. So between the exams we both went to this coffee shop and it was really nice.

After the second exam we both went to the chicken place which was a stall type set up and we got the chicken and went to a nearby park to eat it.

When we sat down she put her bag which was only small in between us which I wasn't sure if it was a sign she didn't want to sit close or if it was just nothing and she just wanted to put it there. We talked and it wasn't busy in the park. At one point our hands touched and she didn't move it away. She kept saying she was cold - it's cold here so I wasn't sure if she was hinting she wanted to be warmed up or not. She said this at least 8 times which now looking back on it makes me feel stupid for not offering her to hold hands or sit closer.

I didn't know and still don't know if she sees me as just a friend as she treats the other boy similarly and laughs at him a lot and smiles at him too. They also get on quite well together. I wasn't sure if she saw me as just a friend or not so I didn't make a move. Especially since it could have been the first date I didn't want to risk coming on too strong. I would have liked to have held her hand or kissed her but I also didn't want to risk making things extremely weird before I knew for sure how she saw things.

On my way home I texted her I enjoyed it and had fun with her to which she replied yeah it was fun :)
I then said yeah, we should do it again sometime. So she replied and said oh yeah sure maybe, I'll have to see if I'm busy.


I told my friends about this and some of them told me I was a bit stupid for not being able to see the signs that she liked me, however some of them also agreed that it wasn't a good idea to try hold her hand or kiss her on the first date anyway. Another agreed with me that there's a possibility she didn't see it as a date at all and recommended I try just asking her if it was a date. I thought this was really stupid but later came around to the idea and asked her on a Snapchat text which she may or may not have half swiped, I don't know. She left it on delivered for 2 hours and then turned off location on Snapchat which is like a last online indicator. I talked with the mutual friend about this and he said I could leave it and get an answer or delete it but he said if I liked her he couldn't understand why I'd want an answer. I realised this and deleted the message. It never went to read but there's a possibility she may have seen it through half swiping. I said ""Hi I'm not meaning to make anything awkward or weird but was yesterday us hanging out as friends or could it be more than that?""
Looking back on this I think it was a mistake. I knew she was busy yesterday evening but she text me later at night as normal with a normal conversational text. I replied as usual however she left me on delivered for 21 hours which made me feel a bit sad. She did reply to it and also send a dry snap of blackness. Normally she sends full face snaps so I noticed this change. I asked her if she had ever been to a specific ice cream place near school and she asked ""What's that"" I now have told her it's a place near school which does really good ice-cream and that I'd like to take her there and that it would be fun. She hasn't replied yet as I literally sent it while typing this. About 20 mins ago so that is relatively normal.

Do you think she may like me, have I messed my chances with her Up by asking about if it was a date or not. And what do you think I should do?

I think it would have helped me immensely to know what to expect — especially during die-off — so this is my attempt to provide some reassurance and transparency for others who may be suffering.

⚠️ Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. This is purely my personal experience as someone who has been suffering badly with SIBO for years. Nothing here is medical advice.

**Background**

* **30-year-old male**
* Symptoms began \~4 years ago (age 26)
* Initially triggered after **severe food poisoning in Thailand** (hospitalized)

# Primary symptoms over the years:

* Severe intestinal pain
* IBS-D (up to **15–20 BMs/day** at worst)
* Extreme gas & fermentation
* Abdominal distention (especially below the belly button)
* Food intolerances
* Dysbiosis
* Brain fog & exhaustion
* Skin fungal infections (recurring)
* Tonsil stones & frequent HSV outbreaks
* Accelerated aging appearance
* Severe mental health decline (borderline suicidal at worst)

Despite **CT scans, ultrasounds, blood tests**, etc., I was repeatedly given the default **“IBS”** diagnosis.

Earlier this year, I was hospitalized after **vomiting blood**.

* Colonoscopy: *clear*
* Endoscopy: **H. pylori infection** confirmed via biopsy

Ironically, I had done countless stool tests over the years — all negative. Apparently in some cases, dependent on where the H-Pylori is and how it sheds, it may not show up in stool tests.

# Possible contributing factor

I heavily overused **PPIs / antacids** throughout my 20s (Omeprazole sometimes twice daily). I later learned this can:

* Enable **H. pylori**
* Increase SIBO risk (estimated \~55% overlap based on what I found online)

# Previous Treatment History

# H. pylori

* Treated with **triple-antibiotic therapy**
* Major improvement in stomach tolerance afterward (coffee, spices, etc.) Best I felt in years temporarily. Despite feeling better, a month or so later, intestinal symptoms continued which led to a diagnosis for...

# SIBO

* Persistent lower intestinal pain, gas, and bloating remained
* Diagnosed clinically with SIBO (Gastro presumed Hydro dominant based on symptoms)
* Treated with **Rifaximin only** (neomycin unavailable in Thailand)
* Experienced **textbook die-off, word-for-word, I felt awful but...**
* **Temporary stool normalization - this was MASSIVE progress, the most normal in years. This confirmed that it was treatable and microbial/fungal/bacterial.**
* **No lasting improvement**
* Symptoms fully returned a few months later. I didn't get a grace period after Rifaximin.

UK doctor later suspected:

* **Mixed SIBO**
* **Fungal involvement** → Rifaximin may have suppressed bacteria but allowed other organisms to flourish

# Current Treatment (Herbal Protocol)

**Started due to unbearable relapse symptoms**

**15 days in at time of writing**

# Herbs (3x daily WITH food, ~6 hours apart):

* **Berberine** – 500mg (WeightWorld)
* **Neem** – 500mg (Simply Pure)
* **Oregano Oil** – \~181mg per capsule (NOW Foods, 55% carvacrol)

🟢 **Activated charcoal** taken **2–3 hours after herbs on bad days** helped *significantly. Only taken on* ***BAD*** *flare up days. I did find they really do help so far.*

# Symptom Scale

* **1/10 = Minimal die-off symptoms / good day**
* **10/10 = Severe symptoms / awful day**

# Herbal Antimicrobial Treatment – Days 1–15 Log

* Energy still poor, slept a lot but no diarrhea, stool normalised.

# Day 6 🟠 (5/10)

* Significant gas & balloon-like bloating
* Indigestion most of the day
* Uncomfortable but not severely painful
* Stool seemed to normalise, healthier than pre-treatment

# Day 7 🟠 (4/10)

* Similar to Day 6
* Gas dominant
* Mild discomfort
* Mild swelling of my intestinal region
* Stool again normal, once per day, looked relatively healthy

# Day 8 🟢 (2/10)

* One of the best days
* Minimal gas & bloating
* Mild discomfort only after herbs
* Some fatigue (likely sleep-related)
* Healthy stool
* Overall felt great

# Day 12 🔴 (10/10)

* Worst day overall
* Severe stomach & intestinal pain
* High gas & pressure
* One explosive diarrhea purge
* Post-BM swelling & soreness

* Strong rebound improvement
* Minimal pain
* Moderate gas
* Normal BMs

* \~75% improvement after extended rest

# Day 14 🔴 (7/10)

* Symptoms rebounded overnight
* Extreme gas, bloating, intestinal soreness, pressure
* Loose/mushy stool
* Heat required
* Charcoal helped significantly

# Day 15 🟢 (3/10)

* Good day overall
* Minimal pain
* Gurgling intestines
* Solid but slightly dry stool
* Symptoms largely normalized

# Final Notes

* Die-off has been **non-linear** (waves of improvement followed by crashes)
* Charcoal helped *a lot* during severe flares
* Abdominal distention has noticeably reduced
* Energy still fluctuates but trends are improving

📊 **I’ll be adding a symptom graph to visualize this progression.**

I’ll also be posting:

* **Week 4 update**
* **Week 8 update**

Again — I’m **not a doctor**, just someone who has suffered badly with SIBO and wanted to share a realistic account of what the **die-off process** can actually feel like. Whilst I did have pretty bad symptoms, I haven't felt like it was necessary to go to the hospital. I expected everything with die off, similar to Rifaximin. However, I do believe too much oregano can be toxic so it's important to space out your doses and don't take more than the recommeded amount. I'd also like to note that on some occasions, on the good days, I've felt definition in my lower stomach for the first time in years, of course symptoms have rebounded with ""purge-like"" waves, but this is hopeful in itself. 

If this helps even one person feel less alone or less scared, it was worth writing. Please pray that my 4 & 8 week updates are more positive! Hopefully I'm through the worst part.

Stay strong.

1pl811s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BackgroundLife8767/comments/1pl811s/double_standards_within_the_fandom/,Double Standards within the fandom,"I have to start by saying, I love both Tori and Jade as characters a lot of people in the fandom pick sides, Team Tori or Team Jade. Most leaning toward Jade, I have to speak my truth, I am Team Tori. I just like her more, it is her own show after all. I love Jade as well but sometimes her gothic mean girl vibe gets annoying. Jade is a very charismatic and charming character. Which is probably what draws people into her, and I get that. I have to admit I fell for it. But I think some of you guys are taking it a little too far, the most common excuses I hear for not liking Tori while at the same time worshipping Jade: “Tori kissed  Beck on the first day of school, Tori stole Jade’s opportunity to do her play, Tori was always flirting with Beck, Tori ruined their relationship, Tori kissed Cat’s boyfriend etc etc” You guys need to know I’m the biggest Tori defender out there. First off, the whole argument that Tori is terrible and irredeemable because she kissed Beck is just so disingenuous because everyone loves to leave out the part where Jade spilled coffee on Tori, for absolutely NO reason. No one wants to hold Beck accountable for being the one in the relationship and giving kissing a girl he knew his girlfriend didn’t like. Don’t give me the “they were acting, they had to stay in character” excuse. He could have easily said no while staying in character. Tori kissed Beck in retaliation, plain and simple. Sorry, I’m taking her side! Then we have the play situation, if I’m being honest it’s really Sikowitz’s fault not Tori’s he scheduled their events on the same day after telling each of them they could do their own thing. That’s on him. Also you all know full well, if roles were reversed Jade would not have given up her play for Tori to do her prom. Tori doesn’t owe Jade anything not after she has spent the entire school year bullying her. Then you have the Tori always flirted with Beck excuse. Actually no she didn’t, they were friends they hugged, they laughed, that mad Jade upset, I guess justifiably so. Tori never ruined their relationship, their relationship was just unbelievably unhealthy. And even when Tori had the chance to be with Beck she rejected him because she was thinking about Jade, you know the girl who had done nothing but belittle her the entire school year. They did nothing but argue, Jade felt insecure etc etc. Now the last point is the only real valid point but if you can forgive the other characters for things they do you can forgive Tori, her kissing Danny (Cat’s boyfriend at the time) was totally messed up but Cat forgave her, she even let her punch her in the face. Mind you that happened in season 1. Three seasons later and y’all still hold a grudge really? Now that we’ve chalked up all the main anti-tori talking points hopefully after reading this (idk what to call this) helped you realize you blew your hatred for Tori out of proportion.

Just like everyone, hindi po ako talaga sugarol but because of stresses in life I fell into it, and it Make my stresses worst. The feeling of shame , guilt , anger is crushing over me during days I’m gambling. I cried so hard to God after my last lost and ask for his help. It was so hard at first and but he answered. I’m 70 days bet free now.

Here’s what I did.

1. Understand how dopamine works on your brain.
2. Accept that the lost won’t coming back.
3. YOU MUST SELF EXCLUDE from gambling sites (this is the FINAL STEP)
4. Install gamban or any blocking sites that block gambling sites
5. Spend your time on exercise 
6. If you are like me where stress is part of your daily life DO NOT DRINK COFFEE IT OVERSTIMULATES THE BRAIN TRUST ME.
7. Pray to God everyday for strength.

At first it will be hard but day after day it will start to feel better again.

One day at a time.

Purpose of this post:

  
I’m writing this to hopefully help anyone else going through SIBO treatment, particularly the herbal antimicrobial route, which I personally found extremely confusing and anxiety-provoking when researching. A lot of people report stopping treatment halfway, switching diagnoses, or never clearly describing what the process actually felt like day to day. I do understand that EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT and reactions to the herbal process will differ from person to person, but what I did see frequently reported was ""waves"" - which I think you may see in this report I made.

I think it would have helped me immensely to know what to expect — especially during die-off — so this is my attempt to provide some reassurance and transparency for others who may be suffering.

1pl7y3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1pl7y3m/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1pl7tza,https://i.redd.it/xgse4wiy5v6g1.png,OUT OF THE TRENCHES + my advice 🫡,"After 3200+ job applications, I can finally say the hunt is over.

All of us know the job market is diabolically cooked. I have lived through it all, from getting ghosted, interviews cancelled for varied reasons, offers rescinded, getting rejected when you were expecting to succeed, feeling like a sore loser, and more. This year was horrendous and exhausting. I don't even feel like celebrating the win rather just feel relieved that I do not have to apply anymore, and grind aimlessly.

200k+ TC, graduated May '25, 3 prior internships (None of them big tech/ faang/ F500). Useless T50 CS school. 4.0 GPA. Started applying Sept '24.

Some of my running thoughts and advice below. Take it as you will.

* This hustle-grindset schtick is stupid and self-harming. Look after yourself, nothing is more important than your health and the people around you.
* Don't associate this extended ""failure period"" as your identity. You are more than your job. Those that matter to you will understand. Have a strong support system.
* Comparison will ruin you. Someone will always get a better offer, earlier, with little to no struggle. Mute, log off, move on.
* Assume interviews are noisy and unfair. Luck is real and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying or already made it. Same resume, same prep, same candidate can get rejected 20 times and then suddenly get a yes because the timing, headcount, interviewer, or internal politics finally line up. Most of this process is you staying in the game long enough for it to be your turn. You cannot control when that happens, only whether you are still around when it does.
* You are competing with laid off mid level/ senior engineers. That is not your fault. Do not internalize it as a skill issue.
* Discouragement is very normal, but please give yourself some grace, bounce back and stay positive.
* Do not be like me. Do not opt out of interviews because you think you aren't good enough for the role. Let them decide that. Apply even if you think you aren't qualified for the role. Be audacious.
* No job is beneath you. Just apply. This whole running behind TC, elitist behavior is not going to take you anywhere. Stop letting the Tiktok-Covid era of Software Engineering get to your head on what the norm is. Money will come over time. You need to get your foot out the door.
* Junior roles are disappearing as we see it but won't become extinct. This would break the fundamental bridge between junior devs and senior devs. You will need juniors to exist, gain experience and knowledge and become seniors who you'll replace when they go out of the workforce. Else there is going to be no one competent left in this industry. This applies to most fields.
* This is a numbers game. Be first and do it repeatedly. Quantity >>> Quality. Quality only matters if you have background in a hyper specific niche they are looking for-Security Clearance/ MATLAB experience (not exhaustive list).
* At some point the job search stops being about improvement and becomes about endurance. If you are still applying, still prepping, and still showing up, you are doing the only thing that actually matters.
* Simplify made things better and worse at the same time. The good being you can apply to more quickly, the bad being so can other people. 
* Be quick to apply. Change the duration in the url for LinkedIn Search when looking for ""past 24 hours"" jobs (it defaults to 86400, you can change it to 7200 and search jobs every 2 hours of the day). This can be a good way to spread, get coverage throughout the day, for roles posted at different times and still maximize your applications. Listening to songs/ podcasts/ yt while doing this helped me not find it mundane. Except Workday, FUCK YOU. Thankfully, they added social login recently but still a big FUCK YOU.
* Do not waste your time with Cover Letters.
* Do not neglect platforms like Handshake/ RippleMatch (I got quite a few callbacks there as well).
* Newsletters like a16z by Jordan Maazer/ tldr etc are also great sources for who's hiring (most of these jobs weren't being indexed by job boards).
* Twitter/ X is an awesome place to find people hiring (most tech bros hangout there and source directly). You need a personalized algorithm for it though, that shows you the right things. Building in public and having an online presence does help here. That is one way to stand out in this market.
* Referrals don't mean shit for the most part. In smaller companies they do, to an extent. Unless you know someone in the company personally/ professionally who's gonna be your champion, and will help you out for a callback via some sort of backdoor internally (which only comes if you have more work experience and have a good relation with former colleagues). So if you are a new grad, you are just wasting your time (unless you can somehow get referrals and apply within the first few minutes of the job posting).
* Inbound messages on Linkedin are pointless. They use Juicebox/ Gem/ Sales Navigator like tools to source candidates based on their requirements and these tools do an absolutely shit job at sourcing candidates. Then they bulk automate and send inmails to everyone and you get ghosted. Do not keep your hopes up by it.
* Follow up once and only once. If you get a recruiter screen or interview, a short follow up after a week is fine. Silence usually means no, and that is okay. Most recruiters have an OOO automated response if they really were on leave and should be directing you to contact someone else in their automated response.
* Stop fucking commenting ""interested"" or ""your email"" on LinkedIn posts sharing job postings/ lists/ promises. They are only here to capitalize on your misery driven impressions to gain LinkedIn Clout. If they really wanted to help, they would have just posted the source in the post. Stop wasting your time.
* Cold emailing does not work in 2025. Probably a few years ago but not now. You'll probably have a better chance reaching out to someone on X/ running into someone in coffee shops in a city thriving in tech. 
* Ghost jobs exist. These jobs are posted on Linkedin and are reposted every day/ week. You'll catch on to this as you keep applying. They are not hiring. They are here to just show that they are a thriving company, to show that they are growing and to appease the investors. Sometimes it is also opportunistic hiring, they aren't ""actively"" hiring. It is just a pipeline for them to have a lot to pick from when they have to.
* The truth is ATS is just half the battle. You still gotta get through Michelle and Becky from Recruiting. They are not technical and are overworked. They also take JD to the word. You might be the creator of Pytorch, but if you do not have XML or some hyper niche thing from the JD on your resume, Becky is going to bin it. So play their game. Hand them the platter.
* Your resume for the most part isn't the problem. It is the nature of recruiting; it's like dating. Everyone has different needs and requirements which is why both markets are terrible. You'll have people saying conflicting things for the same resume. People want a reason to blame something. It is not you or your resume. It is the market, the companies, and their stupidity. 
* I would also suggest that you A/B test your resume. Optimize for callback rate. If one resume version or role type is getting replies, double down on that even if it is not your dream job.
* Be location flexible. Hybrid, onsite, or less hyped cities often have far less competition.
* Do not over-prepare for system design as a new grad. Basic fundamentals, tradeoffs, and clear communication matter more.
* You'll never be fully ready for interviews. Don't push that prep for tomorrow. Start today. You need discipline not motivation. I told myself I'll prep when I get a callback. By then it is too late.
* Learn to tell your story cleanly. Why this role, why this company, and what you actually did on your projects. Rambling kills more interviews than lack of knowledge.
* For smaller companies/ startups-do your research. Anecdotes and genuine curiosity matter more here. Even if they think you remotely match their tribe, you'll be moved ahead. Get them to speak more about their product and the mission. They love talking about themselves. 
* If someone says they are looking for ""cracked engineers"". Walk away. Don't waste your time.
* The current state- you are not allowed to use AI in the interviews but companies can use AI as an excuse to raise the bar. You are frowned upon using AI for your resumes. The very JD was written by AI, the applications are sorted through by AI, the recruiters and inbound messages are also AI. Everything is AI. It is just sad but accept it, adapt and overcome. The sooner the better.
* For the love of god, stop using GPT for every small thing, you are diminishing your critical thinking. Use it to augment your learning/ automate the boring parts. This is a hard pill to swallow for most folks but the average new grad/ junior is much dumber than the folks who graduated before the GPT era.
* Find good set of friends who want to win together and not feel jealous of each other's journey. Important to keep yourself surrounded by them. Teach each other. Do mocks with them, help each other out.

If you are still in this, I know how exhausting and demoralizing it feels. It messes with your confidence and makes you question choices. Nothing about this market is fair or clean. You can do everything right and still get nothing for months. That is not a reflection of your ability or your potential. Eventually, something will stick. If you are still applying, still preparing, and still waking up to try again, you are doing enough. Stay in the game. That is all this market asks of you.

I hope this helps even one person. If it does, then it was worth writing. Thanks for reading.",15,1765585813.0,csMajors,7,1.0,False
1pl7suz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1pl7suz/26nb_just_a_person_seeking_friendships_for_a_more/,26NB - Just a Person Seeking Friendships for a More Fulfilling Life!,"When considering a person’s needs we often think: Food, Shelter, and Clothing. Or some things in this realm, right? And while thats true at the very base of this very hierarchal pyramid of needs (See Abraham Maslow’s theory about this), right in the center of all of that we have a need for connection; for Love and Belonging. Studies have shown that the psychological need for these is so strong, that we as humans have been known to disregard our need for safety; for example, the way an abused person might cling to their abuser.

I have family, and even a partner. But I have lived 26 years on this planet and have very few friends to show for it. I moved around a lot as a kid, didn’t grow close with my peers like everyone else, and now I don’t have any school friends. I didn’t go to college, and, well, the workforce hasn’t been generous with like minded individuals so there goes that opportunity. So here I am trying the online world!

I am a laid back and fun loving individual. I am very caring, have great problem solving skills, but I give terrible advice! I am slow to trust individuals, but am an open book as far as my life story goes. I love sharing and comparing lives with folks, its fascinating to discover how similar your life can be to someone so different or vice versa; how different your life can be from someone you thought was just like you. 

You don’t have to be the most interesting person around to capture my attention, nor do you have to be the funniest to make me laugh. I am rather easy to socialize with as long as you are a decent person. You just have to be someone who has patience and humor.


And here is a list of things I like:

1pl7n5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/clusterheads/comments/1pl7n5h/cluster_is_melted_my_brain/,Cluster is melted my brain.,"I can't call anyone. During an attack, it's just me and the pain; nobody else. There's no point in involving anyone else. The people around me already know about my illness, but what's as agonizing as the pain itself during an attack is the fact that nobody can help me, and nobody ever will. Helplessness. Undeserved helplessness. This isn't a test; this isn't how a test should be. I live alone; calling a family member would only infect them with what I'm going through. Nobody can help me; they'd just witness my state and become even more upset. Psychologically, I'm truly a living, breathing dead person. I'm always depressed when I'm alone. I'm usually cheerful and lively around people; that's probably just my personality, but this illness has turned me into a helpless, pathetic person. Now I feel like a helpless, pathetic person who pretends to smile and acts fake. I'm always unhappy when I'm alone. How can I communicate with the people I see and interact with every day after suffering alone, going crazy, and then returning to normal? I'm finished; my life was ruined three hours ago. But I've returned to normal, oh hi, how's it going, as if nothing happened, is that it? Or, ""I experienced this three hours ago, I feel terrible,"" blah blah. You don't just experience it once, so you can't tell people about it in detail. You had an attack, you told someone, and then what? The next evening, two days later, a month later, you had another attack, are you going to tell them about that too? Am I going to tell everyone around me about every attack I have in my life, or am I going to hide it, pretending to be a person who's rotting inside but looks fine on the outside? There have been many times when I've called 911 out of desperation at the peak of an attack. Almost every time, the attack is over or very close to over by the time they arrive. I know exactly what's going to happen when I call, but what else can I do? The teams that arrive are a separate disaster. Did you bring us here for this? The same attitude every time. Did you call 112 for a headache? It never changes, they always do the same thing. I just say I want oxygen, they put something on my finger and say the oxygen is fine. I can't convince healthcare workers by describing this hell I've been living through for 8 years. The ambulance that arrives tells me to go to the emergency room, not to call them. I've been to the emergency room 10 times during attacks. Every time it's the same story; they make it incredibly difficult to give me oxygen, and most of the time they don't. I tell the woman in the ambulance that I get oxygen at home but my tank is empty, and she says that taking that much oxygen causes headaches. They don't even know how to keep quiet about things they don't know. I beg and plead for oxygen, put the mask they give me on my face, and there's not even a breeze; they give it at such low pressure. Doesn't anyone else go to the emergency room for this reason? Don't these people learn about this disease through experience? Are there only 100 people in all of Türkiye who have this disease? You go to the emergency room, and none of the staff know anything about it. They don't even do a little research to apply treatment accordingly. The only thing they know is giving IV fluids. Even though I've told them countless times that it won't work, they stick to their usual routine. Generally, every time I go to a hospital, I cause a huge fuss. I've had many arguments and sworn at people. This will never be the last time. Yesterday, I had another emergency. They couldn't even read the instructions on the paper my doctor gave me, the one that said ""go to the emergency room, you'll need oxygen."" They weren't even giving me the treatment I wanted. They put me in a green zone, there were 13 people in front of me, and I was standing there trembling and crying. They didn't even think about seeing me like that and saying, ""Let's talk to a doctor,"" and they just handed me that paper. What level of conscience, what level of human feeling is this? I really don't know. I want to say shame on this country, its system, and its citizens. Shame on those who put those people there as healthcare workers. Those pathetic people who are allowed to play with human lives just because they passed a stupid exam, working for money. They all just sit there every day with their coffee, waiting for the day to end so they can go home. I'd like to say may God give them all the same pain, but I don't belong to any religious belief. Conscience is something within a person, it has nothing to do with faith. These people can believe as much as they want. They are devoid of conscience, compassion, and humanity. I'm criticizing the whole country, the system, and its people all by myself. We live in decaying, rotten lands. I'm rotten too; I'm useless to myself, and I'm no good to anyone. I don't know how a person really lives, how a lifetime passes with this illness. I guess the rest of my life will pass in this helplessness, just like the last 8 years. At least, right now I'm a normal person; the pain is gone, everything is fine, everything is rosy. Who knows what will happen in 2 hours, who knows what will happen tomorrow? Should you be happy that you've overcome the attack, or should you go crazy wondering when the next one will come? I don't find life worth living, and I'm not brave enough to end my life. I'm truly a walking dead person. Life goes on, you forget everything, you get yourself together, you go to work tomorrow, you meet people. I've already lost my mind. My condolences to all of us.",5,1765585282.0,clusterheads,4,1.0,False
1pl7mvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1pl7mvh/first_disney_cruise_review/,First Disney Cruise Review,"I went for a Very Merrytime Disney cruise on the Fantasy and disembarked today and here’s how it went:

First of all, this is my first time on a cruise ever. My boyfriend’s sister invited the whole family for this cruise because she’s been a Disney cruiser and wanted her whole family to experience it. We were a big party (14!) and I think that impacted some things. I do not have kids, but there were three kids of varying ages in our group. 

I’d say if you’re going as a group, you should discuss what you want to do upon embarking. As soon as we got on the boat we were pulled in many directions. Some went to Cabanas, some went to deck 11, and I wanted to get the Rainforest Room passes. 

The Rainforest Room was one of our top favorites. There was only one time on the trip that it was completely full and we still ended up going to the steam room. We decided to start our mornings in the RR in the hot tub and the steam room. The aromatherapy showers were a letdown and were cold most of the time. There was maybe one shower that would heat up some time.

The adult only deck hot tub was always full during the ideal hot tubbing times and so having a little more private access made my little introverted heart happy. 

One of the best kept secrets is the changing rooms in the spa by the fitness center. We discovered the showers on the first day and my boyfriend chose to use those daily. I liked the stateroom soaps and shampoos so I switched to showering back at the room, but we loved that if we were using the Rainforest Room and then wanted to keep our plans to deck 11 and deck 12 we could just go to the changing rooms to freshen up instead of going all the way back to the stateroom. My boyfriend put a bathing suit and change of clothes in a locker every morning. The lockers were never completely full. 

I know this sounds dumb, but one thing that just made me happy throughout the whole trip was just how stocked everything was. Disney crew work quietly and around the clock to make sure we had everything we needed from soaps to towels. There was only one time we were curious about our room not being cleaned and then we came back from an activity and it was cleaned and organized. The efficiency and organization of DCL is unlike anything I’ve experienced. 

I also got a manicure because my nails broke the day before I left for Florida. Although the manicurist was also one of my favorite people of the whole experience, the manicure caused several issues. They didn’t realize my nails had dip, and due to limitations on the ship about use of tools, it took twice as long to get the manicure which interrupted our plans to get off the boat at Nassau. Then my manicure peeled the next day even though I wasn’t doing much of anything with my hands and I had to get it fixed the following day, so it interrupted the day even more. It ended up costing twice the amount I would have paid my nail tech on land and it was a purchase I regret. That said, the staff were all very sweet and helpful. In the future it probably wouldn’t be a service I repeat. 

Cove Cafe has great coffee if you’re cool with paying the extra amount. They felt like a real coffee house. Cabanas can be intense, especially on the last breakfast on sea day, but the churro waffles were worth it. I really enjoyed the walk up restaurants and sometimes my boyfriend and I felt like the walk up food was a better experience than the main dining room food. I especially liked the pizza and the hot dogs on a hot day or a night of drinking. I ordered the buffalo wings and an arugula salad from room service a couple times and they were both great. My boyfriend said his fave food hands down were the cheeseburgers. 

My favorite main dining room was Enchanted Garden. We ate there twice and I felt the food was better there both times. Our servers were sweet and engaged with us throughout the time. I like that they come along with us so they can call us by name. As an adult without children, I wish we could have had the later dinner, but we had the first meal because there were small children in our party. It did make some of the adult activities like trivia hard to get to when their start times interfered with our dinner time. It also took a long time to get through dinner, but we had a party of 14, so could you really blame them? They did their best. I think if I were to go again with different people we would try Palo or Remy. 

Pirate night was one of the best nights on the whole boat! It felt like an all-ages party and the Europa section felt like it continued the party. The adults in my group had a blast with the after party karaoke. My boyfriend and I don’t really go to costume parties and so we didn’t know how we’d feel, but it ended up being one of our favorite nights.

I felt like they had plenty for adults to do, especially childless adults. We enjoyed Europa and went to all the different bars. The Tube had lots of trivia and Bingo was intense! We also went to Oh La La a few times to hear the two pianists. One pianist was from Italy and knew songs I love and it made me emotional. My boyfriend and I love going to jazz and piano bars so it felt like we were on a real vacation visiting somewhere else and each bar gave us a vibe we were on a different part of a vacation. I don’t know how else to explain it. Oh La La and Skyline were my favorites.

All of the drinks were solid, too. I didn’t have a single alcoholic beverage that I felt was disappointing, and believe me I drank a lot. The drink of the day was usually something tropical and we really enjoyed (sometimes too much) drinking them throughout the day/evening. Skyline had the best dirty martini I have had and Oh La La had a champagne drink called the Eddlebubble that smoked when you popped the bubbles and tasted dangerously delicious. 

Lastly, I think the ship allowed me to be an adult and a child. I got to meet Goofy, who is my fave, while also enjoying the experience of being an adult on a Bahamian cruise. I know I keep saying “adult”, but I don’t have kids and was a little leery about the overstimulation aspect that sometimes comes with Disney (I.e. theme parks). 

I told my boyfriend that I think my sister and my mother would like this cruise, specifically Disney. It seems like they have something for everyone and, who knows, maybe I’ll kick off my 40th birthday with a future cruise!

I love coffee. I started with filter coffee, then switched to a moka pot about 2 years ago. Now I want to upgrade to an espresso machine.

After research, my top two were Breville Barista Express and Gaggia Classic Pro. But I just noticed the Breville Barista Express Impress is available for around $899, only $100 more than the regular Barista Express. (Also Impress has some holiday offer in Canada (Free Coffee beans, temperature control Pitcher, Tamping Mat, 2 Cappuccino Mug, and i guess 1 MF cloth)

If I’m already choosing Breville (and not Gaggia), is the extra $100 for the Impress actually worth it, or should I just get the normal Barista Express?

I like the idea of the assisted dosing/tamping on the Impress, but not sure if it’s just a gimmick or genuinely helpful for home use.

Also if you think Gaggia Classic Pro is still the better choice overall, please tell me why.

Chocolate is a widely appreciated foodstuff with historical appreciation as a food from the gods. In addition to its highly palatable taste, it is a rich source of (poly)phenolics, which have several proposed salutogenic effects, including [neuroprotective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/neuroprotective-agent) anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cardioprotective capabilities. Despite the known benefits of this ancient foodstuff, there is a paucity of information on the effects of chocolate in the context of [chronic kidney disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/chronic-kidney-disease) (CKD). This review focusses on the potential salutogenic contribution of chocolate intake, to mitigate inflammatory and oxidative burden in CKD, its potential, for cardiovascular protection and on the maintenance of diversity in [gut microbiota](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gut-microbiota), as well as clinical perspectives, on regular chocolate intake by CKD patients.

# Introduction

(Poly)phenolics are natural botanical compounds that, *in planta*, act against pathogens and protect the plants from ultraviolet radiation \[1\]. In humans, dietary (poly)phenolic intake has been proposed to facilitate anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects \[1,2\]. Tea, wine, coffee, vegetables, fruits, nuts, cereals and cocoa (often as chocolate) are common sources of (poly)phenolics in the diet \[3\].

# Chocolate and the microbiome

# Chocolate and cardiovascular health

# Chocolate and central nervous effects

# Chocolate in chronic kidney disease

Patients with CKD display an increasing prevalence of premature cardiovascular events. These are accompanied by a underpinning dysregulated ageing processes, typified by an elevated oxidative and inflammatory burden, mitochondrial dysfunction \[\[179\], \[180\], \[181\]\] as well as low bioavailability of NO and early vascular aging \[\[182\], \[183\], \[184\], \[185\], \[186\]\].

Cardiovascular complications in CKD could be mitigated via anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of (poly)phenolics present in...

# Conclusion

Evidence supports the use of cocoa as a nutraceutical agent to mitigate the effects of CKD. A growing body of literature has indicated that (poly)phenolics present in cocoa, provide a substrate for the growth of the normative core microbiome and engender the production of alkyl catechols that act as cytoprotective agonists. Since cocoa derived (poly)phenolics may reduce the inflammatory and oxidative burdens that accompany CKD, it may have direct impact on cardiovascular risk and

I have already tried adjusted the inner set of burrs to their finest setting and even with the outer wheel set to 1 I still lack pressure. The weirdest thing is im dosing 18g and going for 36g out but its taking 45+ seconds. I have no idea what I am doing wrong.

1pl7gbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1pl7gbx/first_colposcopy_experience_better_than_i_thought/,First colposcopy experience (better than I thought),"Hello all! 

I am 27F and just got an abnormal pap result (LSIL) with postive HPV (mrna e6/e7) last month. This was my first pap smear after my pregnancy 3 years ago. All my past pap smears have always been normal. 

I just had my colposcopy done a few hours ago. I want to share my experience because I want to help others out with what to expect and ease any fears. I was shitting bricks from the moment I found out I needed to get one. 

Being a hypochondriac and anxiety ridden person did not help while reading and hearing about others’ traumatizing experiences. I hope I help out at least one person to feel a little less nervous going into this. 

To start off, i’m gonna say I am extremely blessed to have a great OBGYN and PA-C.
My OBGYN is always out for deliveries so his PA-C performed my procedure instead. She was amazing! I am going to admit that I was nervous about this at first because you would think a PA-C has less experience doing these things but boy was I wrong! 

Okay lets get to the point: 

I arrived, signed a waiver, peed in a cup, and had my vitals checked. I chose not to bring my husband in with me and left him in the waiting room. 

I’m sitting on the exam table half naked and the PA-C comes in. She immediately asks if I have any questions or concerns. I riddled her with a million questions about the type of HPV I have and if it would eventually clear.. etc.
At this point, i’m telling her i’m terrified and don’t know how well I will tolerate this procedure but she reassures me throughout the whole thing. She begins by telling me the steps and what I will likely feel. Cool. Maybe I shouldn’t know because it all sounded extremely scary to say the least.

First step: 

Speculum. Okay nothing crazy she was actually very gentle and I did not feel discomfort at all.

She tells me the first part is obtaining an ECC which is pretty much swabbing the inside of the cervix. Very very mild cramping involved. I think my papsmear overall felt more uncomfortable than this part. She swabbed twice and moved on. 

My legs are shaking. 
Shaking so bad and I’m embarrassed. 
I keep apologizing for not being able to stop myself from shaking but she’s reassuring me that it’s perfectly normal.

Next, she puts in cotton balls full of acetic acid which sounds painful but I didn’t feel this at all. She did warn me i’d feel warmth or mild burning sensation in the vaginal canal if the acid did touch it but would subside almost immediately. And it did. 

Fast forward to a minute later, she’s looking into her colposcope (which in my case looked like a phone screen with a camera and light at the end of it). She tells me that even if she doesnt see areas of concern, she will still take biopsy samples to rule out any hidden affected zones that are deeper in the cervix. 

Alright now the hard part:

She says she will inject lidocaine into my cervix to numb it so I don’t feel the actual biopsy. I was mortified!!!! What do you mean i’m about to have a needle go into my cervix?!?!!

It’s a pretty long looking needle like the one they use at the dentist but here’s the best part: I didn’t even feel the first two injections. I only felt one but it was a very mild pinching pain that went away instantly. 

All in all, she mentioned she was taking biopsies from 12 o’clock, 2 o’clock, 6 o’clock, and 8 o’clock. Those 4 parts had to be numbed. 

I was afraid to feel anything so I was focusing a lot on my slow deep breaths. I was also looking at the ceiling and praying for this to be over. Once the numbing was over with, I knew the hard part was long gone. 

The biopsy began a few minutes after the numbing, though it felt faster than I thought it would. I could hear clicking sounds every time she would take a sample but I didn’t feel a thing! Before I knew it, we were done with the big scary part. She explained we had to make sure the bleeding was stopped because the cervix is pretty sensitive when it comes to bleeding. I think overall, this was the most painful part for me. It wasn’t pain you can’t tolerate, it was more like constant period cramps. Now, she was inserting long cotton swabs in there and dabbing and that in itself caused the cramping but it was over before I knew it. I was talking to her the whole time and asking questions so I think that helped a lot as well. 

I forgot to mention I had my arm under my head and the other hand was holding my neck in a chokehold to keep me from panicking. Which I think also helped me a lot

She took out the speculum and it was over!!! The relief I felt was inmense. 
I was given wipes to clean myself, after care instructions, and a pad for any discharge.


Since it’s been a few hours, I just went to pee for the first time and I have no bloody or coffee ground discharge as of yet. I do feel the tiniest very tolerable cramps now but I’m not worried about it. 


Please please please don’t let any of this scare you into checking yourself out. I would take this anyday over any type of reproductive cancers or cancer overall. 

I was so close to cancelling this procedure because I thought I wouldn’t be able to handle it. Yes, I had a baby but that was all my epidural doing the work.

This was a wild ride but it was way better than I could’ve ever thought. I will get my results in a few days. I’m a little worried about that now but i’m praying for all of you girls going through the same thing! May we all heal. We are soooooo much stronger than we think.

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. I put the location tag as US, since I'm not really restricted on location.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

I think the majority here have tried B&M at some point or another so I don’t need to explain how awesome their soaps are. This scent seemed like it would be right up my alley.

I am a woman in my mid 40s, (in UK) autistic and ADHD, peri menopausal, with anxiety and monthly PMDD style luteal phase crash. I started ADHD medication a few months ago (MedikinetXL) and honestly I was hoping for that “life changing” shift everyone talks about. Instead, I feel flatter, more anxious and more tired than before.

I am currently on the slow release one. I have been taking it consistently and gave it a proper go. Initially there was a small lift in motivation and organisation, but that faded quickly. Now I am dealing with increased anxiety, rumination, emotional flatness and a noticeable drop in executive function again. I've been on Sertraline for about 15 years and my Psych upped my dose to 150mg plus gave me sedatives as I was in such a state on one appointment, the next check-in I was prob having a 'good' day so seemed better. Now i'm back in the PMDD zone and task initiation, follow through and basic day to day functioning feel harder, not easier. This week I've barely got out of bed and cant' stop crying.

What is confusing me is that I tolerate other stimulants fine. Coffee helps me. Socially, I have always gravitated towards stimulation and dopamine seeking, and I had hoped medication would reduce that pull. Instead, I still crave it, which has been really disappointing and honestly upsetting.

I keep questioning myself because on the better weeks I think maybe I should just push through, and then the bad weeks hit and I feel completely wiped out and hopeless. I am now waiting for a medication review and trying to work out whether this is just not the right fit for my nervous system, or whether I am missing something.

Does anyone have any similar experience on methylphenidate and a better experience on something else? I feel so gutted after so many years of pushing to get to this stage that its not doing what I hoped. Not looking for medical advice, just real experiences. I feel quite alone with this and could use some perspective from people who get it.",1,1765583676.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False
1pl70xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1pl70xh/paris_on_a_low_budget_and_with_physical/,Paris on a low budget and with physical limitations,"Hi everyone :)

I did read through the wiki some, but I thought I'd ask here for a more personalised opinion. I'm finally headed to Paris on the 7th of February and leaving on the 18th. I'll be staying with a friend in Ozoir-la-Ferrière, and we will travel to Paris (and perhaps nearby day trips) as needed.

I have two things to keep in mind, which is why I made this post.

Firstly, I have Axial Spondyloarthritis. It's not incapacitating, but I do have constant low-level pain that increases with long periods of walking or standing. I'm comfortable walking and standing for a day, as long as I can have a short break every now and then. This can be repeated after rest every day.

Secondly, I'll be going on as low a budget as possible. I won't have too much available funds, and the exchange rate from RMB (China, where I'm a resident right now) to EUR isn't too great. So let's say max 1000 euros. 

On the 15th I will have extra funds available as that is when I get paid. So on the 16th and 17th I can splurge for something truly remarkable. Or two somethings. This can be an experience or for example a nice dinner. 

Some examples of things I love: parks/nature/gardens, art, museums, coffee shops/cafes/bakeries, cultural history, walking to explore, wine, champagne (but my friend doesn't drink so it's not as fun alone), libraries, book stores. 

I'm not someone who has to spend a lot of money to have fun. I'll happily explore and do window shopping. I just need to know where to go!

Some examples of things that look interesting to me/my friend suggested:

* Catacombs (not sure how smart that would be with my back)
* Disneyland
* Louvre
* Notre-Dame Cathedral
* Eiffel Tower (obviously)
* Arch de Triomphe

I know I have a really small budget and some physical limitations. Keeping these two things in mind, do you have any activities to suggest? Or day trips? I can sleep over for one night if necessary.

1pl6zv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pl6zv2/i_reside_inside_a_facility_for_victims_of/,"I reside inside a facility for victims of brainwashing. Yesterday, I was Rachel. Today, I am Astrid.","Last week, I was Rachel.

Yesterday, I was Rachel.

But today, I'm Astrid.

I'm 24 years old, and I’m a victim of brainwashing.

It's weird. With the cocktail of medication I take every day, I feel numb. 

But then I stare down at my skin and see where I've carved into my own flesh with my nails and smashed my mirror. 

I've clawed at my door, and there are marks on the wall where I've smashed my head into the tiles. 

I don't feel it or remember it. But I do see the clumsy stitches across my temple and my blackened eyes, split lips, and band-aids when I’m cleaning my teeth.

According to Dr. Chase, I'm one of the worst cases inside this facility. 

I didn't know until yesterday that this place had WiFi. 

Harvey leaned over in his chair during Quiet Time and scribbled it on his whiteboard. 

He's the only one allowed a whiteboard. 

Unlike me, who chooses not to speak, he physically can't. 

If he does, bad things happen.

Harvey's been using the internet to play League of Legends. He's tried to describe the lore through scribbles and bad drawings, but I still don't understand it.

Harvey playing games is surprising, but it's healthier than what he's usually doing.

I've been encouraged to tell my experience on paper because I refuse to talk. 

Between you and me, though, it's not that I'm mute like the barrage of doctors here have concluded. I just don't want to talk. 

I don't even know what to say. How do I talk to these professionals pretending to care? 

They’re not subtle about being more interested in the brainwashing itself than in my mental state.

They prod and poke me with cocked heads and wide, fascinated eyes like I'm a newly discovered pathogen.

I'm surprised they haven't dissected me. 

*Now, Astrid, we just want to help you!* they croon, prickly fingers lingering a little too long on my scalp. 

They want to shave my head again for more tests, but I’ve almost grown it to my shoulders. 

I'm not staying here long enough for them to shave my head again. I won't let them.

*We just want to take samples*, they say, which is a huge contradiction of their own words. 

Last week, we were told we could go home. 

But, like I said, that's not looking likely. I blame it on the boys, who can't get a fucking hold of themselves. 

They use whiteboards for weapons and markers as makeshift knives. I admit our collective mental state isn't… great. 

But I feel well in myself. I can't remember a lot about myself. 

I had to be told my name, and I don't know if I have family out there.

There are splinters. Like jigsaw pieces coming together. I have a sister, though I can't remember her face. 

I can finally think straight, and I've stopped trying to poke my eyes out. 

Nights are a lot better these days when I'm taking my medication. 

Days have color, and I'm getting better with being separated from the others. 

It's still hard, being away from them. 

But I just count the days, minutes, hours, and seconds.

22 hours.

4 minutes.

53 seconds.

Every minute, the clock ticks down in my head, counting down to when I can see my friends.

Dr. Chase told us in group therapy that we’re *a unique set of patients*. 

I don't think he knows what to call us. Officially, this facility is supposed to heal neurological trauma and brainwashing.

But according to several private conversations I've overheard, the four of us are the first actual victims of brainwashing. I'm not talking drug-induced hypnosis or mental torture. (Or in some way, I am.) We’re the real deal.

Which means, I guess, we’re valuable.

What scares me is these people, whose lives revolve around this specific technology, have no idea what it is or where it came from.

“We care about you, Astrid,” they tell me with soothing, patient tones that should calm me down. 

Bullshit. They want what is inside of me. 

Dr. Chase doesn't just want to cure me. 

He comes into my room in the night hours and just stands in the doorway, scratching his head. 

Then he brings in others, dark silhouettes looming over me when they think I'm sleeping.

They all dress the same, disheveled looking and kind of gawky. They all say the same thing: *I've never seen anything like this before*. Which is concerning. 

They have theories, of course, but I don't think they even believe their own hypotheses. 

During lunchtime, I see them slip into Nicholas’s room. 

He's considered a band red, so I’m not surprised he's the mind they fawn over.

Fuck Nicholas. I wish the asshole would come back to earth.

I thought he was okay, and then in the middle of group therapy, the idiot attacks a nurse. 

I was dragged away before I could really see anything, but all I had to see was the glistening red puddle on the floor and the sharp scarlet smears staining the cuffs of his clinical white pants for me to know he, in fact, was not okay. He just kept… going.

Fuck. 

He wouldn't stop, slamming the corner of his whiteboard into the orderly’s skull. 

The sharp splint of plastic made a surprisingly good blade. 

I was already being dragged away, but I couldn't stop staring. The orderly wasn't moving anymore, and what was left of his head was splattered all over the floor.

It reminded me of a coconut that had been cracked open. 

When Nicholas raised the whiteboard again, his expression completely blank, I could still see where he'd drawn a sad face in response to the question, *How are you guys feeling today?*

Nicholas had been feeling “:(“ for a while, despite showing little to no emotion. 

I think his mental state is keeping all of us here. And while I despise him for prolonging our seemingly endless stay here… that doesn't stop our nightly chats. 

I won't fully go into why I have to talk to him, but if I don't, I will fall apart.

I will get into that.

It's like being bound to someone, something poisonous, but I can't get him out of my head. I wouldn't say we talk, exactly. 

Lights out, I climb into bed and knock three times on my wall. 

We have our own code. 

Technically, none of us are allowed to talk directly to each other outside of therapy. 

Dr. Chase said communication could be detrimental to our healing.

Like I said, though, it's impossible not to talk to them. So, we talk in our own way. 

Harvey and I talk through whiteboards, and Addie actually speaks.

Rarely, because when she does start talking, Addie can't stop, her words tangling, turning into gibberish. 

Her eyes roll back, and she starts trembling, blood seeping from her nose. 

Dr. Chase explained it's a reaction to what they can't get out of her. He describes them as splinters too small to retrieve.

When Addie does speak, she talks about the world we’re told to forget. 

She talks about a life that wasn't real. Addie’s had four different surgeries, and they still can't get them out. 

They are the reason behind her slurring words and noticeable twitch. The idea of tiny pieces of something just stuck in the meat of my brain makes me shudder.

Nicholas and I? Unlike Addie and Harvey, we use the good old-fashioned way.

One knock on my wall is, *“I can't talk tonight.”*

Two is, *“Do you want to talk?”*

And three, my most commonly used: *You're a fucking idiot.*

He doesn't reply anymore. Instead, he just screams. Nicholas used to reply. 

Before the tests began and the world slowly started to feel real again, we talked endlessly all night through knocks with our own patterns, and I was so in love. 

The type of love that felt endless.

How can I describe love I can't even remember? How can I describe feelings that were implanted and not organic?

It didn't come like a soft wave, like a first love. This was forceful, a parasite leaching into my skull, words that weren't mine twisting on my lips.

I remember being apart from him, from them, felt like a physical chain wrapped around me, a suffocating wave dragging me into the dark. 

Now it is different, however. With the medication and the tests, and then being forcefully isolated from each other, I am Astrid and Nicholas is a stranger. 

I am Astrid, and Nicholas is the psycho in Room T101.

I miss the earlier days.

Neither of us were on earth at that point, and the world was like one big carousel ride I couldn't get off of. 

He was always by my side, escaping his own room and slamming his hands into my door, screaming at the guards dragging me away. It was fun. 

Like we were on an adventure, and the only bad people were the figures in white pricking our necks with sedatives and trying to pull us apart. We’ve already escaped once. All of us. 

Back when I called him by a different name. 

Back when that name was reality, and everything else was a dream.

Dr. Chase told me sternly that it wasn't Nicholas.

And he was trying to make the real Nicholas better.

I should probably tell you why I'm writing this.

What got me shoved in here in the first place.

I knew Craigslist didn't have a great track record, but I was taking a chance on a room. I don't remember much about my living situation, but I know I wanted out. 

So, I was taking risks. 

It was a fairly innocent ad that caught my eye when I was browsing the homepage.

A modern college house in the middle of the city.

I got a reply when the frazzled-looking barista handed me my drink.

*hey, thx for inquiring abt the room! Do you want to come check it out? :) *

The owner sent me the address, and I ended up standing in front of a large, red door. But I wasn't alone. I noticed I was being followed, halfway down the block.

I crossed the road, and so did the figure. When I twisted around, a college guy around my age was staring down at the leaves he was kicking through, nodding his head to music corked in his ears. 

It was the trench coat that threw me off guard.

I couldn't see a face, only a shock of reddish curls catching the late afternoon sunlight. 

When it became clear we were heading in the same direction, he lifted his head, eyes narrowing like this was some kind of game, and I was in the lead. Then he was quickening his steps.

I started power walking, both to get away from him and because a stray thought pushed its way into my mind. I needed to get there first.

Clearly, he was also thinking it, his expression hardening with concentration. 

When he was at my side, the two of us shooting panicked glances at each other, I walked faster. He followed. 

And by the time we were shoving past each other through the gate, trampling a growing pile of leaves and practically sprinting to the door, I realized I was unknowingly fighting for the room.

The guy, whose face was now visible, had narrow features and wide brown eyes. 

He was cute, with a mop of reddish curls and freckles. His clothes screamed English major. It wasn’t my type of cute. 

I preferred the manly types, and this guy was kinda scrawny. Nerd cute, is what I would have called him.

He slammed his hand on the door first, so I guess he'd won. 

Still, I was standing like an idiot, half-hoping he'd offer rock, paper, scissors. 

There was an awkward silence before he slowly lowered his hand from the door and then knocked. He seemed nervous, suddenly, his hands delving into his pockets and picking at his shirt.

“You're here for the room.” He said it more like a statement, avoiding eye contact and bouncing on his heels. This guy smelled like old books, sandalwood, and freshly brewed coffee. The embodiment of fall itself.

“I am.” I said, and when his lip curled in distaste, I remembered we were rivals.

“I’m Astrid.” I said.

He nodded slowly, withholding his own. “Cool.”

I tried to smile, though my patience was running thin. “Do you want me to go, or…?”

He was supposed to say *no, no, we can figure this out like normal humans!*. 

But this guy just shrugged. 

“If you want,” he side-eyed me. “The room is mine, because, y’know, I got here first.”

I didn't realize how much I wanted the room until he was trying to take it from me. 

“When I applied for it, I didn't see any views,” I found myself gritting out. “So, technically, I saw it first. If we’re using your logic.”

He didn't look at me. “Smart.”

I nodded. “Exactly. So, it's as much my room as yours.”

The guy’s head jerked like I had personally insulted him. “I inquired this morning,” he said, his smile too wide. Too many teeth. “I scan the app every day. This is the best room I've seen by far, and it's overlooking the town.”

“Well, so do I.” I snapped back. “I read through it on my phone.”

“Good for you.” He rolled his eyes, corking his earphones back in. “Feel free to hang around,” the boy deadpanned. “But I wouldn’t recommend it.”

I felt it then, a sudden, irresistible urge to get the last word.

“Fine.” I said, my cheeks burning.

He knocked again, folding his arms. “Cool.”

“Cool!” I said, my voice going higher in pitch.

His lip curled into a smirk. “I didn’t realize I had a parrot on my shoulder.”

Another painful silence, with me trying to think of a comeback that wasn’t childish, catching his glances, the curve of his lips forming a smirk.

He knew I was struggling.

Before either of us could surrender, the door flew open, a bright-eyed girl poking her head through the gap. 

She looked younger than the two of us, maybe her first or second year of college. 

She was a blur of blonde curls and wide smiles, a feverish energy almost knocking me off my feet. 

The warm, golden light swimming around her was homely. 

The guy must have thought the same, his eyes momentarily entranced by the light.

I saw his shoulders relax slightly, his expression loosening.

But he still made a point of keeping his distance from me, like he was already a housemate, and I was a stray cat.

“Hi!” the girl's gaze snapped to each of us, her smile growing wider. 

She reached out to shake my hand. Her fingers were so cold. “You’re Astrid, right? The girl who wants the room!”

I nodded, feeling smug, before she reached out to shake the guy’s hand, though he high-fived her instead. “Harvey! You’re here for the room too!”

For a moment, her eyes seemed to light up. “Oh!” The girl laughed. 

She spoke straight expletives. Her energy was cute, but it was too in my face. “Wait, are you guys, like, uhh, inquiring *together*?” 

She steepled her fingers together like she was implying something else, and we shared a mutual look of *what the fuck*, before he laughed. Not just laughed. I’m talking spluttering, almost keeling over.

“No.” I said, at the same time as the guy deadpanned, *“I'm good.”*

Ouch.

The owner laughed, like he was a comedic genius. 

“Well, it’s nice to meet you guys! Why don’t you two come on in? I’m just making iced tea!”

She ushered us in. Harvey stepped forward first, kicking off his shoes, and I followed hesitantly. 

The house was exactly what I wanted. I walked straight into rustic paintwork and a ratty welcome mat with the “H” missing from *home sweet home*. 

Cute and endearing.

Further down the hall, the place oozed warmth. The lounge was small but homely, beanbags in place of a couch. 

The owner danced into the kitchen, and Harvey followed. I noticed he was drinking everything, and I mean everything in. 

He picked up a ceramic pig from a small table, frowning at it. Then a wooden horse. 

Clearly, he was yet to learn basic human decency at the grand age of twenty-something.

“We’re in the kitchen!” the owner trilled when I found myself intrigued by Harvey full-body scanning everything in his vicinity.

The guy almost dropped the pig, his eyes widening. Harvey met my gaze.

*We?* He mouthed.

I don’t know what was wrong with me. 

Maybe there was something in the air. But the second Harvey straightened up, I was already power-walking toward the kitchen. 

He was right behind me, his socks sliding on the marble flooring in a rush to reach the room before me.

I won this time. Just.

With Harvey breathing down my neck, trying to shove his way through.

He had the energy of an older brother.

Once I was on the threshold, however, my momentary glee at winning this silent battle with a stranger dissipated. 

There were two others sitting around a table, cocked heads and polite smiles that were definitely not expecting us.

A ponytailed brunette caught my eye, her lip curled. She was pretty. The kind of pretty I wasn’t used to. 

The pretty that caught my breath and made my chest ache. 

This girl was glowing, dressed in designer fall fashion, a striped scarf wrapped around her neck. 

Sitting across from her was a mop of blonde curls peering at the two of us like we were aliens stepping from a mothership. 

Previously, it looked like he'd been falling asleep, fist resting on his chin.

Still, he raised his hand in a shy wave, a small crease of a smile on his lips.

Ponytail wasn’t as welcoming. Her cat-like eyes raked me up and down, head to toe. “Another one?”

Clearly, neither of us knew we were there for the same room.

The owner, who was clattering around making drinks, gestured us to sit down. 

I did, sliding into a seat. I had no idea why I was still there. There was one room and four of us, and I wasn’t planning on losing my dignity for a cheap room in the city. 

I decided I’d announce I was leaving, but before I could, a glass was set in front of me. Iced tea. It looked homemade, condensation fogging up the glass.

Slowly lowering myself back into my chair, I took an experimental sip.

Lemons, with a tinge of ginger, maybe some vodka.

It tasted good, a refreshing flush down my throat.

“I’m Tella, by the way!” The owner leaned against the counter comfortably, her hands cradling her own drink. 

She nodded to the other two. “Addie and Zach were just telling me their majors.”

Harvey made a point of reluctantly dropping into his chair. He downed his drink in one gulp. 

“English Language Arts,” he announced, hiding a burp behind his hand. “Not to be *that* guy, I love the whole roomies vibe, but who’s getting this room?” 

He nodded at Tella, who turned and grabbed cookies from a cupboard. 

“There are four of us and one room,” he said. “Which, by the way, is the cheapest I’ve ever seen. So.” Harvey leaned forward. “Why invite *all* of us?”

He was right, but he didn’t have to be a dick about it.

Tella didn’t speak for a moment, flashing us a grin.

“Do you guys like… sitcoms?”

The question took me off guard. I thought she said, “Do you guys like CD-ROMs?” but then Ponytail, or Addie, was nodding, delicately sipping from her glass. “Yeah, they’re all right, I guess. I’ve seen all of the classics.”

“They’re not funny.” I noticed Harvey’s grip slip around the rim of his glass, before he tightened his hold. “The jokes are painful, and the humor tries way too–”

I jumped when a shattering sound hit my ears, drowning out the rest of Harvey’s rant. Tella had dropped her glass. 

But she didn’t move, her hand still in mid-air, fingers clenched, like she was still holding it. 

“How much?” she spoke softly, her lips curving into a small smile. 

I noticed she was barefoot, and the crunch of her stepping into shards of glass. 

“How much what…?” The blonde, Zach, finally spoke up. 

His accent was definitely from New York, a thick Long Island drawl in his tone. 

He too looked like he was ready to leave. 

Zach tipped sideways in his chair, before I realized he was just reaching for his backpack.

Tella didn’t look at us. Her feet were bleeding, but her smile was stretching wide across her lips. 

There was something in her eyes I couldn’t understand. She couldn’t feel the pain of glass slicing into her flesh. Iced tea crept back up my throat in a sour paste. 

“How much…” she spaced out her words, “do you… guys… like sitcoms?” 

Her emphasis on the word was like an explosion, mania and excitement collapsing into one, and my body began to catch up with my brain.

I think that was the moment the four of us collectively realized, through panicked looks, that Tella was *that* type of person.

I was the first to remember how to move. 

“I’ve changed my mind,” I said in a breath, which tangled on my tongue.

What came out instead was *ivechangmijnd*. 

I jumped up and reached for the door, but my head swam, the world jolting. It looked like what electroshocks feel like, the kitchen tiles and ceiling bleeding into one. I blinked rapidly. No. No, I was still sitting down. 

I hadn’t moved an inch from the chair. I don’t know how to describe this experience. Dr. Chase had to sedate me the first time I recalled it because apparently, I’d tried to hurt myself. 

He told me it was my brain’s response to recalling a bad memory. 

When I try to say it out loud, I get jittery, and I start jamming my teeth into my tongue.

With the meds, all of my fear is stripped away. I can dig into the recesses of my own trauma and see it as something brighter. 

Cognitive behavioral therapy used to be a memory that put me in the quiet room for weeks, trying and failing to crack my own skull open. 

*We were just getting high*, Dr. Chase and the other doctors told me, sitting me down on crinkly paper on a bed, and peering into my eyes with weird glasses. 

They told me to close my eyes and go over the memory again, and this time I had to replace Zach’s screaming with laughing.

Tella didn’t spike our drinks with mind-rotting hallucinogens and sedatives.

She just gave us weed.

“Fuck.” Harvey’s voice sounded like he was in a tunnel, a tangled moan rolling off his tongue. I was half aware of Zach on his hands and knees… laughing.

“What did you put in those… drinks?”

“Yeah. What did you puhrrt in thissssss?” Harvey dragged out the S until something hit the table with a thunk. 

His glass, followed by his head. 

I remember trying to ask if he was okay before my lips were numb, my vision blurring into one singular pinprick, light slowly bleeding away. 

There wasn’t enough time for darkness. Thunk went my head, dropping onto the table.

Another thunk, and a crash.

Addie.

I heard her head slam into the kitchen tiles.

Her body.

Fuck.

I can’t write this.

Her body landed in shattered glass that I could hear Tella crunching through.

So dark. I was nothing for a while, and there was nothing. Not like dreaming or sleeping, or just being knocked out. 

It was deeper. More permanent. It felt like a choking, suffocating oblivion swallowing me up—before choking me back out. 

When I cracked one eye open, it was light. 

Too bright. I was standing, my body more of a puppet on strings.

My clothes felt itchy and wrong, and old. Like I had been wearing them for weeks. Months. There was something in my head, writhing in my ears.

Laughter.

I couldn’t move my body, my expression, my lips, or eyes. I was paralyzed, the world going on around me. 

Initially, it looked like I’d woken up in a cozy lounge. 

There was a couch behind me, a colorful rug, and warm, rustic wallpaper.

But then I was looking past all of that, at scary silver walls of metal that went on for seemingly forever.

I wasn’t inside an apartment.

I was on a stage.

Disoriented, it took me a moment to register a figure standing in front of me. 

I noticed disheveled clothes first, crumpled jeans and a shirt glued to a skeletal figure. 

I didn’t know his face.

He was younger. Maybe by a year or two. 

Whoever he was, this guy had been here longer. 

He was the shell of a human being, pathetic remains of what had been someone—something. 

Brown hair fell in wide eyes glued to me, lips parted like he was talking. 

I waited for him to scream, to cry out for help. His eyes told me one thing. Play along.

Part of me wanted to refuse.

But then something wet and fleshy hit the ground in front of us, the world jolting once more. My vision started to clear, and something slammed into me, a wave of ice water stealing my breath.

There wasn’t paint on the walls. It was too bright, too new and then old, scarlet streaks blurring together. 

The carpet under my bare feet was suddenly slimy and wet, pooling red seeping through my toes. Through tunnel vision, a man had been standing in front of me.

With a clearer head, however, I saw flaws my mind had skimmed past; dark shadows under his eyes, yellowing bruises blossoming across his cheeks, a split lip, a thin trail of dried scarlet pooling down his temple. 

I think my brain was trying to shield what was in the corners of the room.

Bodies piled on top of each other, some of them old, piles of bones, and some of them fresh.

Still warm.

The couch behind the guy was filled with three figures. I recognized them. 

Zach, Addie, and Harvey. 

Neither of them moved, their heads bowed. I jumped, or at least I internally jumped, when the man standing in front of me took my hands.

Wet.

His fingers were slick red, and I tried to pull away.

But I couldn’t.

He opened his mouth, squeezing onto my fingers.

“I didn’t think there was a relationship to fuck up!”

His voice was surprisingly calm, his expression twisting. It hit me that we were in the middle of an argument. In the middle of an argument that I didn’t remember, but my tongue was already entangled. 

I backed away from him, as if my strings were being tugged, my lips curling into a scowl. “I thought we were broken up!”

Laughter followed again, a sharp thunderclap in my skull, pain I had never felt before—raw and acute—striking the back of my head.

I couldn’t move my hands to signal that I needed help.

My brain felt like it was igniting. Burning. He was like me. 

He couldn’t move, and yet somehow he was squeezing my fingers hard enough to send a message: *Play along.* 

And I did, my lips moving without me, words that weren’t mine, an expression that wasn’t mine. “We were on a *break*!”

I was the backseat passenger inside my own body. “We said we weren’t going to see other people!”

Immediately, he followed along, a natural somehow.

“How was I supposed to know? I’m not a psychic! If I was, I’d be, like, ten billion dollars richer!” he paused. More laughter. 

“I mean… *we* would be, uh, ten billion dollars richer.” He pulled a face. “Nailed it.”

The words were pushing through my mouth, forceful. “Don’t think you can sweet-talk me with ten million dollars!”

“Billion, Rachel.” He corrected, his lips curling into a smirk.

I planted my hands on my hips, shooting a look at the non-existent camera. 

“What? I can’t help being smart!”

I hit him with the newspaper suddenly in my hand. “YOU? Smart?”

A snort from the couch.

Harvey.

“Just please,” he paused. “Be kind to the furniture when you’re fighting.” His voice choked up, laughter following.

“It’s innocent, I tell you. Innocent!” he twisted around, his eyes *made* of static.

“Get a room, you two.”

The laughter didn’t stop. Louder. Rooted inside my skull.

My words tasted like blood. I could feel it seeping down my nose and chin.

There were bugs crawling in my head. 

I could feel them, sense them sinking their tiny claws into the meat of my brain, pouring from my ears and sticking to my neck. 

Their chitter was both inside my head and in the room, writhing on the walls, feasting on fleshy remains. 

They sunk into my thoughts, once again turning them into cotton candy, plunging me into uncertain oblivion. 

I spat blood through words that suddenly didn’t make sense.

My legs buckled.

The conversation went on while I was being violently pulled back inside my mind.

*Rachel.*

The electric pinpricks in my head played with my thoughts.

No.

I fought back.

Astrid.

Consciousness came in waves. Sometimes I was standing with the nameless man, and others, I was with Zach, Harvey, and Addie. 

After a while of suffocating on nothing, I used these momentary bursts of clarity to be thankful for those around me.

My hair grew long, almost to my knees, until Tella cut it all off, scrubbing the blood off my face and making me all better.

I can’t remember when we lost Zach.

One minute, the two of us were talking, and the next, I could see them—tiny, skittering bugs pouring from his mouth and eyes, his body coming apart in front of me. 

I didn’t react when a chunk of him hit me in the cheek. I couldn’t react. I hadn’t spoken my own words in months. And when I tried to, my tongue was seized from me. 

When Tella cleaned away Zach and spread the rest of him over the walls for the feast, I started calling myself a different name.

I was… *Rachel.*

The bugs eating me from the inside told me I was called Rachel.

If I fought back, they made me wish I were dead. They made me slam my head into the ground, trying to cave my own skull in. 

I remember there was a moment of coherency after we lost Zach and before we gave in to our new lives. It was rare for all of us to be awake at the same time. 

Sometimes the bugs inside our brains went to sleep, leaving us conscious and aware for hours at a time, and keeping the facade became progressively harder. 

Addie found the exit door by accident.

She said we were in a bunker locked with a biometric scanner.

Harvey found a weapon, a lead pipe. We timed it perfectly. Tella went to get food for exactly 45 minutes every single day.

So, Harvey planned to bash her fucking brains in.

He hypothesized that she was controlling the bugs somehow. And without Tella, there would be no bugs.

I wish he was right.

Because then we would have only spent a year in captivity.

What Harvey wasn’t planning on was these things having sentience. 

They wanted the act to continue, and even with Tella gone for a moment, they wanted to be entertained. 

So, they entertained themselves. 

That was the day we lost Harvey too. He didn’t splatter in my face like Zach—a warm, wet streak on my cheeks. 

Instead of attacking Tella, he slammed the pipe into his own head, again and again, until he dropped to his knees, blood pouring from his nose, begging for mercy.

Tella did give us mercy.

She stopped us from thinking for a while.

And slowly, my name started to fade away.

Rachel.

I snapped awake halfway through a conversation. 

Zach’s body had toppled onto its side, still leaning against the wall, a casual viewer. 

Harvey had facial hair, his hair grown out. 

There was a smile stretched across his lips. 

Harvey called me Rachel. 

So, I called him the name skittering in my mind, trying to break from my lips. 

Danny. 

I refused to surrender until that moment.

Because calling him that felt natural, and I knew all of him. After all, he was my friend.

More darkness, and I stopped thinking again.

All I could sense was the sharp chitter in my skull.

Light.

Addie and I were sitting on the couch watching TV. She had a bowl of popcorn. 

I could see Zach in the corner of my vision. Maggots had gotten into his eyes.

Addie’s gaze was fixed on the TV screen, which was off. Her name was Elody. 

She handed me a chip, her words light and whimsical, almost like we were dreaming.

“Chip?” she offered me another, her raucous laughter rattling my head. 

I got a boyfriend soon after—the man I was always talking to, sleeping with, my arms wrapped around him. 

Even as a backseat passenger, I still felt like my heart was fluttering, my chest aching. He felt natural next to me, and over the years of blinking back awake, the two of us stopped fighting it.

His eyes had almost become animated over the years.

He was always smiling.

Laughing.

Blood spilling from his lips had become normal.

I had friends and a boyfriend, living in a huge apartment, a group of twenty-somethings living together as a group.

As friends.

What more could I ask for?

Days passed after that.

Weeks.

Months.

Years.

Light flooded inside the bunker when we were playing charades. 

Light felt more suffocating than the dark. 

It pierced my eyes, sending me to my knees, cutting our game short. 

I was sitting with my arms wrapped around my boyfriend when sudden thundering voices sounded, and the laughter inside my head started to falter. “They’re in here!” 

Before I knew what was happening, our tiny piece of heaven was being destroyed.

Figures appeared with heavy weapons, pale light flashing in our eyes. 

In the startling allure, my body became free for a moment. 

I caught Addie blinking rapidly, Harvey frowning down at his red-slicked hands.

The walls around us were painted, stained in human remains.

And so were we.

A woman came over to me. Her eyes were wide, scared. Zach wasn't there anymore—a pile of bones on the floor.

“Astrid?” she spoke calmly, calling for medics.

All around me, my friends were being checked over. 

Harvey stumbled away from the figures, his eyes wide in the bright allure. “No,” he choked out in a laugh. “No, we’re fine! Can you please get out of our house?” He gestured to the door that had been blown through.

“Now THAT is going to be our day job tomorrow.”

Laughter sounded in my head, so I ignored the woman throwing a blanket over me, the words spewing from my lips before I could stop them. “You mean it's going to be YOUR day job.”

“Astrid!” The woman slapped me, and some lost color bled back into reality.

“Astrid, can you hear me? I am so sorry, sweetie, but you're in shock, okay? I'm going to help you. I promise—”

Her words collapsed into white noise when Addie started screaming, and Harvey was dragged away from her. 

I reached out for my boyfriend's hand, but he was kneeling on the floor. A man was shining a light in his flickering eyes. 

“Nicholas?” he spoke softly, and my boyfriend only cocked his head, frowning. 

“Nick, can you tell me how many fingers I’m holding up, please?”

His gaze found mine.

“It’s okay,” I told him, panic twisting my gut. “It’s okay, baby. Tell them, and… and maybe they'll go away.”

He did, through a spluttered laugh.

“Five. Now, can you go away now, please? Jeez, it’s a Friday night, man!”

The man checking him over let out a hiss before lifting his head.

“Get away from them,” he snapped, and the other figures backed away slowly.

He looked scared, shaken. “Can we get someone else in here?” he started picking dead bugs off my boyfriend's neck with tweezers. “We, uh, I don’t think we’re qualified to deal with this.”

That was when my world started to come apart.

My boyfriend was dragged away, and a hysterical Harvey attacked the woman trying to help him. 

I heard her scream, but before I could see what was happening, a cruel, cold prick slid into the back of my neck. 

I didn’t realize I was screaming too until I was gently brought to my knees, trembling, sobbing into the ground. I was sinking into the abyss when footsteps sounded.

A figure loomed over me, and my lips were numb.

Help.

I needed help.

I needed my friends.

“What have we got?” a male voice crept into my mind as I was falling.

“Six kidnapped students that went missing in 2020,” a female voice said. “Four are heavily inebriated. One turned herself in, and Zach Cartwright is confirmed deceased. No traces of drugs or alcohol. There’s nothing but… bugs. I’ve never seen anything like it. These things are part organic, but—”

“Astrid?”

I didn’t respond, my eyes flickering. I felt my body swaying back and forth.

“Rachel.”

I jerked my head toward the voice, reality bleeding back into fruition. 

Time had skipped forward. I was sitting in a white room, my legs swinging off a bed. 

My hair was gone. 

A smiling woman was in front of me. She detailed the basics. I was quarantined inside a facility for victims of brainwashing.

When I jumped off the bed and tried to get out, the nurse calmly led me back onto the bed. 

When she was less gentle, strapping me down, the nurse told me I was going to be in a lot of pain, but it was for the best. 

She said there was pain, but I don’t remember it. 

Even if my body does. I still have scorch marks in the backs of my eyes.

I was weak, my body limp, vomit dripping down my chin, when the nurse gently took my hands. “Astrid,” she ignored my correction. “Would you like to see what has influenced this type of behavior?” 

The nurse cleared her throat. “We don’t exactly know what it is. What we do know is that it attached itself to your spinal cord, feeding you information.” Her lips formed a frown.

“Which has influenced you into thinking… certain things. Your name, for example.” 

She held out a small silver instrument, and attached to it was a writhing thing struggling to keep hold. 

“Astrid, you were a prisoner for three years, and this is the result of your current mental state. We are going to help you, but you have to let us.” 

Her gaze dropped to the ground. “Which would require a certain… surgery to remove this… infestation.”

“No.” I shook my head. “I want to see my friends.”

“Astrid, that won’t be possible right now.”

Instead of speaking, I clawed at her face and screamed, demanding to be reunited with my friends. 

It hurt being away from them. When I tried to explain it, I received sympathetic smiles.

But then I had the surgery, and the invisible ribbon binding us together was cruelly severed. I started therapy on my own, and then with them. 

The others didn’t talk. When Addie spoke, she suffered seizures. Harvey preferred using a whiteboard, and Nicholas didn’t even acknowledge us until he grew violent.

Dr. Chase thinks the things have laid eggs inside his mind and are still in control. 

Three nights ago, I awoke inside the bunker that had held me captive. With me were Harvey, Addie, and Nicholas. Zach was there too.

In front of us was a picnic blanket filled with food and drink, and we laughed and talked like we were still inside our little heaven. 

Nicholas wrapped his arms around me, and I nestled my head in his lap. He was smiling again.

The walls around us were chittering, moving.

Calling.

They want the show to continue.

I thought it was a dream, but my feet were caked in dirt from walking around barefoot. 

At breakfast the morning after, Harvey grabbed my hand and pulled me into the bathroom. He scribbled something on his whiteboard.

DID YOU??? LAST NIGHT??? WHAT WAS THAT???

I could only nod, breathless.

He wrote another message, this time in bubble letters.

“LIGHTS OUT. WE GO LOOKING FOR THAT BITCH.” He’d drawn an angry face next to it, and I smiled.

I hadn’t smiled in a while.

Tella, our kidnapper, is inside the facility with us. 

She too is receiving a different kind of treatment.

So, per what Harvey said, we planned to meet after lights out.

But he never showed up.

This morning, a nurse informed me there was an incident during his surgery, and I won’t be able to see him anymore.

Dr. Chase said Harvey is in a ‘very bad state.’

Nicholas and Addie are deteriorating.

But I can still see them.

When I go to sleep, I awaken inside our apartment, and the laughter is back.

The chittering in my skull grows louder.

Our little piece of heaven.

But then I wake up, and he’s not at breakfast. Addie is missing too, and the screams inside Nicholas’s room terrify me.

I just want to see my *friends.*

19 hours.

34 minutes.

Just a guy near Boston looking to make some new connections. I've been in the ENM space for a few years, but I'm looking to expand a bit, meet new like-minded folks. Brief description, Latino, 5'10"", dark hair and eyes, got a bit of a dad bod, but no kids. I live with my partner and a roommate. Looking for solo stuff, but if we click with each other's partners down the road, that's cool, too! 

I like drawing and writing. I have a backlog of stories I will never write but love to conceptualize and make art for. I enjoy gaming, playing mostly single player video games, some co-op and PvP games. Baldur's Gate 3, most Souls-likes, Dragon Age, Genshin, Helldivers 2, Arc Raiders, Fortnite, Marvel Rivals are the games I'm most into right now. And I play D&D, been playing on a campaign for a few years now and I've been running my own test campaign for probably about a year. I love role-playing and making characters. 

I like to watch movies and shows I grew up with (I can recite and quote so many of those things). A:TLA, Code Lyoko, Supernatural, Lucifer, Castlevania, just to name a few shows. I love animation. 

As to what I'm looking for, anyone who I can chill with every once in a while. Someone who I can go out with to do things, but it doesn't have to be anything big. I'm hoping to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee (hot chocolate for me, lol) or going on a walk. Maybe then go watch a movie. I've been wanting to watch FNAF, but my partner and roommate don't, so...¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm also open to doing some online stuff, but hopefully we can do some in-person at some point if things go well.

The last thing, being open and honest, is it would be nice if we were both interested in going NSFW with it eventually. I'm a pretty sexual person, that sort of intimacy is important to me. Not expecting it on the first date or anything, but it's a big part of any relationship for me. If it's not your vibe, I totally understand! But I'm looking for someone who can enjoy that kind of flirty, sexy dynamic, you know? 

If you're interested, let me know!

1pl6q6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1pl6q6i/which_smart_water_bottle_for_kids_and_families/,Which smart water bottle for kids and families?,"Looking for a smart water bottle that works for the whole family? You're not alone. More parents are switching to these high-tech bottles because they actually help kids (and adults) drink more water throughout the day.

## What Makes Smart Water Bottles Different?

Regular water bottles just sit there. Smart bottles do the actual work of reminding you to stay hydrated. They light up, send notifications to your phone, and track how much water everyone drinks. For families with picky drinkers or kids who forget to hydrate during school, these bottles can be game-changers.

## Key Features to Look For

When shopping for a family-friendly smart water bottle, you want something durable enough for kids but useful enough for adults. Here's what matters:

**Hydration reminders** - The bottle glows or buzzes when it's time to drink. This works great for kids who get distracted easily.

**Easy-to-read displays** - Some bottles show how much water you've had and how much is left for the day. Simple LED lights work better for younger kids than complicated screens.

**Drop-proof design** - Kids drop things. A lot. Silicone sleeves and shatterproof materials save you from buying replacements every month.

**Battery life** - Nobody wants to charge a water bottle every day. Look for bottles that last at least a week between charges.

**App connectivity** - Parents can check if their kids actually drank water at school. Some apps even let you set custom reminders for different family members.

## Why Families Love Them

Smart water bottles solve real problems. Your seven-year-old comes home from school actually hydrated. Your teenager stops buying expensive drinks because their water bottle makes drinking water more interesting. You remember to drink water during busy workdays instead of reaching for your third coffee.

The bottles that track intake throughout the day help you spot patterns too. Maybe your kid drinks nothing between lunch and dinner, or maybe they're doing great on weekends but struggling on school days.

## Finding the Right One

Different families need different features. Some want simple light-up reminders. Others want detailed tracking and family challenges through an app. Temperature control matters if you want cold water all day or prefer room temperature.

You can check out various options and read reviews to see what fits your family's needs. [This collection of smart water bottles](https://athomewave.com/smart-water-bottle) shows different styles and features so you can compare what works best.

## Worth the Investment?

These bottles cost more than regular ones, but they typically last longer and actually get used. When kids get excited about their glowing water bottle, they drink more. When parents get reminders throughout busy days, they stay healthier. It's one of those purchases that keeps paying off.

Most families notice results within the first week. Kids start asking for water instead of juice. Adults have fewer afternoon headaches. Everyone feels a bit better overall.

If you're ready to upgrade your family's hydration game, [browse the smart water bottle options here](https://athomewave.com/smart-water-bottle) and see which features match your family's lifestyle. The right bottle makes healthy habits way easier to stick with.",1,1765582771.0,productplace,0,1.0,False

Also before any judgement my ex and I had been friends for 4 years before we actually dated. We met in school, I asked him out.

I met up with my Ex today over coffee to get some work done, after being in his company in that hour, and hardly talking, I’ve come to the realization of why I’ve been struggling with my current boyfriend.

I don’t want to say I’m mature or better than anyone, but after a rough childhood and teen years I find myself struggling to click with boy’s my age. I clicked with my Ex because I didn’t have to be the responsible one, and I could be an adult with him. I was treated like an adult, and we both had a love for our faith. He respected me, and my desire for having a life outside of my relationship.

This isn’t the case for my current relationship for the last 4 months. I have to be the responsible one, I have to plan for everything, and follow time tables. He doesn’t know how to cook, his parents still do all of his chores for him, and he needs me to do almost every adult thing in our relationship. Whether budgeting, college work, or even waking him up on time (we don’t live together, I just have to call him in the morning or else he’s late for class).

We have different love languages, he needs physical touch whilst I get overstimulated after a certain amount of time. I feel like I can’t take my own time to work on myself, and when I do I’m met with constant texts about how he’s scared I’ll leave him. Or if I’m busy with my parents, he’ll blatantly insult them. (My ex didn’t like my mom either, but atleast he was respectful of her). My free time has to be spent with him or else he’ll be cold and aloof next time I see him, because to him I’m pulling away from him.

I want to focus on my career, and school too. Which means I might have to move across the country to finish my degree path. And right now I find I barely have time to focus on my own life

After coffee today to get art projects done, I realized I missed not feeling like I’m pressured to pay attention to someone, or talking 24/7. The silence between us is comforting, if anything, and when conversation did come to us, it flowed naturally.

I’m trying to figure out if my relationship could be saved or not, and if not how do I end it safely without hurting him?",0,1765582767.0,relationship_advice,3,0.25,False
1pl6q2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1pl6q2o/review_trying_every_pineward_pt_v_november_25/,Review: Trying Every Pineward Pt V (November 25 Sample Set Edition),"Hello friends and welcome back to one humble reviewer's quest to sample all of Pineward's catalog. Today I'll be diving into not only the current winter sampler set, but also a lot of other random ones that I've been accumulating over the past months. I've already reviewed 2 scents from the current winter sampler set in an earlier review (Coffee Tabac and White Fir), but I'll be re-reviewing and giving an updated rating now that I've smelled literally hundreds of scents in between.

If you are interested in looking back on the Pineward journey:

* [Pineward Review 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1iowha5/pineward_perfumes_a_wordy_review/) (and my first review ever)
* [Pineward Review 2 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jfr138/pineward_perfumes_even_more_reviews/)(a search for hay and barnyard)
* [Pineward Review 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1kod6cc/review_pineward_summer_sampler/) (a summer sampler)
* [Pineward Review 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lz7uer/review_yet_another_pineward_woody_sampler_set/) (special edition woody sampler set)

WINTER COLLECTION:

**Sugarplum (Freebie):** This opened as a sugared plum (no surprises there), but on numerous samplings turned into something horrible and rotten at the 1-30 minute mark. And then, as swiftly as it morphed, it morphed back into its original plum form. Whether this was a unique body chemistry experience or maybe some microscopic lingering fragrance molecules from the prior day, we may never know what caused this but it was ROUGH and kept happening over and over. You might ask why I kept sampling something that makes me want to gag? For science, obviously! But yeah, there’s something rotten in the state of this perfume, but maybe only for me? ***Notes:*** *prototype, no given notes.* \[2.5/10\]

**Mint Cocoa:** Normally Pineward’s scents are quite strong and long-lasting, but this one is a bit quieter on my skin. It opens up with a delicious peppermint patty scent, and then the chocolate sort of fades, leaving a milky lingering mint. Unfortunately it gets a bit waxy over time, and loses most of its oomph after about 2 hours. By no means a bad fragrance (but you have to love chocolate and mint!) but wasn’t quite doing it for me.   ***Notes****: peppermint, chocolate, vanilla, malt powder, cream, cedar, resins, spices, patchouli.* \[6/10\]

**Gingerbread:** Oh yessss, gingerbread my love! This is a true gourmand’s gourmand; it’s not just sweet, it actually smells like the whole damn cookie with flour, sugar, spices, and even a hint of butter. Overwhelmingly the spice note is cinnamon, but there’s enough ginger and clove to carry this at a distance. This smells exactly like the Swedish gingerbread I made with my mother over Thanksgiving! There’s a thin breadiness to it that makes it super realistic. Jo Malone Ginger Biscuit who??  ***Notes:*** *ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, wheat absolute, molasses distillate, brown sugar, black walnut, milk accord, butter, vanilla, icing.*

**Christmas Wine:** Opens with a burst of red fruits and then…mulch? Like fragrant, fir mulch? This is not what I expected at all. It is vaguely Christmas-y with the spices in the background, but I can’t help but feel like I’m sniffing a decorative bundle of twigs, or a centerpiece decoration on someone’s table. I think it’s the sandalwood and frankincense that come to the forefront here? I don’t hate it but it’s so, so, weird to me that none of the cherry/cranberry/raspberry/chocolate notes last more than 3 seconds. A rather boring woody smell. Dries down slightly sticky. ***Notes:*** *cranberry, champaca, cherry compote, raspberry, fir balsam, chocolate, davana attar, oakmoss, tolu balsam, rose, sandalwood, frankincense.* \[4/10\]

**Gluhwein:** Absolutely nothing at all like Christmas Wine, even though in my head I assumed those two things are the same? This has the dark red fruitiness that lasts and makes up the base of the scent, but any sweetness is tamped down by something herbal (fir balsam and juniper berry?). I think it successfully plays on the safe side of Christmas candle, but my brain really really wants to go there.  It still doesn’t smell like wine I’ve encountered, or even any gluhwein, but it does seem like an elevated red fruit Christmas sort of scent if you’re into that kind of thing. I’m not though! Also, this dries down sticky. ***Notes:*** *cranberry, blood orange, cloves, nutmeg, fir balsam, iris, red currant, scotch pine, juniper berry.* \[5/10\]

**White Fir**: I haaaaaated [this the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1iowha5/pineward_perfumes_a_wordy_review/) \- it was one of my few Pineward scrubbers. This time I got a very very strong orange competing with a very strong fir note. It does remind me of setting up our Christmas tree every year in the living room and the sticky pine sap it would leave behind on our fingers. Also, unfortunately, orange juice. Not a love, but not a scrubber. EDIT: apparently this has been officially reformulated for 2025 ***Notes***: *orange, ginger, white fir, clove, anise, pine, musk, vetiver, oakmoss.* \[5/10\] (originally 3/10)

**Coffee Tabac**: [On the first go-around](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1iowha5/pineward_perfumes_a_wordy_review/) earlier this  year all I was getting was patchouli. On the second test this fall, I get the coffee and tobacco, but they’re quickly overtaken by the warm spices. Clove and nutmeg? For a minute it’s a very unpleasant clove bomb, but it mellows out. Pulls a little masculine. Dries down to warm spices with barely any coffee. Fine, but not for me. Bumping this up 2.5 rating points because warm spices are nice! **Notes:** *loose-leaf burley tobacco, mocha coffee, vanilla, cedar, guaiac wood, incense, resins, spices, patchouli.* \[6.5/10\] (originally 4/10)



ASSORTED OTHER SCENTS:

**Gelatto**: The crazy juicy lime from Lime Cola with none of the weird industrial sharpness, plus a dry down similar to Noki? Yes please! This is another absolute banger of a summer fragrance. Despite the name, it doesn’t smell like a delicious Italian dessert or anything else edible. It also doesn’t really smell like florals. It’s hard to put into words, but it’s a creamy lime musk, unlike anything I’ve really smelled before. I will be absolutely full-sizing! ***Notes:*** *makrut lime, jasmine sambac, mandarin orange, gardenia, massoia bark, sandalwood, ambergris* \[9/10\]

**Alfiryn**: As a white florals hater this is way outside my comfort zone and I can’t tell if I love this or hate this. It's the most realistic florals I’ve come across yet in a perfume; waxy and full, the green of cut stems in water, just a day away from rot. I can imagine my skin is covered in petals. There is a fascinating humidity that is really tricking my brain and the tiniest hint of something zingy which keeps it interesting \[the ginger lily?\]. I can’t even get my brain around this. I think this might be a masterpiece, but not a masterpiece that I would wear.  ***Notes***: *narcissus enfleurage, pink lotus, plumeria, ginger lily, freshly cut stems, massoia, sandalwood, cedar, iris, and white musk.* \[7/10\]

**Shire:**  Pineward gets a lot of attention for their pine notes, but I think they deserve extra praise for their honey note, which is on full display here. Generally I find that honey notes tend to take over on my skin, and while it does take over here, it doesn’t go dank, animalic, powdery, or cloying. This is a powerful honey, but also warm and light in a way that lets the oats shine in the dry down. Later on the herbs and lavender poke out and keep things interesting. I’m kind of shocked that the orris isn’t making this into a powder bomb, but I’m grateful. The jasmine might be there but I can’t smell it. Just a calm, light, airy honey with oatmeal and a tiny bit of dusty hay in the background. Really really nice.  ***Notes***: *hay, oatmeal, hazelnut, bergamot, lavender, herbal tea, westfarthing leaf (tobacco), seed cake, jasmine, orris, and honey.* \[8.5/10\]

**Autumnal:** This is sweet in a way that feels physically thick, but cut through with that unusual mint note. I wore it on a day that was around 76 degrees and it felt way too cloying for that (moderate) heat. It’s sweet but also masculine…I don’t know how to categorize this but it’s definitely not a cozy autumn scent to me. Maybe it’s the mate that’s throwing me off? This smells almost camphorous, like some kind of herbal pain relief balm. My husband commented that it seemed “nutty with some citronella.” I get the peppermint, the fir, the cinnamon, a grassy element, and a tiny bit of beeswax but it is not a mix that is working for me.  ***Notes:*** *peppermint, cinnamon, alfalfa, maté, nettle leaf, beeswax\*, bran, deer's tongue, chamomile, fir, wheat, oakwood.* \[4/10\]

**Cotswold**: I don’t know what I was expecting, but it wasn’t this. It’s a very, very strong smoke note that brings me back to the beef jerky situation with [Mournhold](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lz7uer/review_yet_another_pineward_woody_sampler_set/) for five seconds (even though Mournhold didn’t have smoke in the notes?) It’s all okay though; it dries down to a lovely balanced smoke and spruce scent with very little vanilla. This is very close to **It’s My Pyre** by Treading Water, but missing the tiny spice note that really takes it to the next level for me. Pulls slightly masculine. Interesting, nuanced, but I think a rather safe blind buy for the aspiring lumberjack in your life.  ***Notes***: *cedar, smoke, oakwood, ponderosa pine needles, black spruce, vanilla, hops.* \[8/10\]

**Pumpkivus:** Smoke? Wtf is with this smoke note? Maybe it’s just the very rowdy patchouli, which is front and center. Y’all weren’t lying when you said this was NOT SWEET at all. I do get the pumpkin flesh note, but with everything else going on it dries down to sort of a dry wood. I have a very hard time getting a handle on this one but it’s a very vegetal, masculine scent. Not something I would choose for myself.  ***Notes***: *pumpkin flesh, pumpkin seed, brown sugar, vetiver, osmanthus, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, hay, black soil, corn silk, corn silage, oud*. \[6/10\]

**Old Toby (Freebie):** The name alone is a LOTR reference to pipe tobacco, so I was expecting this to be very tobacco-forward, but it starts out surprisingly zingy and green. Maybe fresh  tobacco leaf? It’s uncharacteristically light on my skin for Pineward, which usually has more oomph. As it matures it gets a little more herbal/medicinal, with something that smells almost like cherry. Also, some high quality men’s shaving product? Is that what a fougere is? This reads as rather masculine to me, but very pleasant and not part of the generic “cologne” profile that one encounters so often. I’ll be very interested to see what the notes are when this is released, but it’s not my personal taste.  ***Notes***: *prototype, no given notes.* \[6/10\]

**Sturbridge:** Hmmmm no. Immediate no. I don’t know what it is but it’s giving Christmas candle in the worst way. I think it’s the apple and spices in the notes? Historically I’ve had awful luck with apples, so maybe I should’ve known better. It’s musty and artificial and for Pineward I feel like that’s pretty rare! I didn’t scrub and the dry down was less offensive after a few hours, but this is still one of my least favorite Pinewards.   ***Notes***: *pine resin, frankincense, myrrh, spikenard, baked apple, pinecone oil, fir balsam, spices, balm of Gilead (poplar), amber, cedar, ambergris.*\[3.5/10\]

**Treacle**: Despite the name it’s surprisingly not very sweet. There’s something super funky in this; it’s sour, animalic, a bit barnyard-y. The dark, funky, sourness reminds me a lot of [Hayride](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jfr138/pineward_perfumes_even_more_reviews/) which I really enjoy, despite the opener being a bit rank. I have no idea how I’m getting all of this from the notes - maybe it’s the way the tea and tobacco come together? I can see this one being divisive but it eventually mellows out into a vaguely sweet, masculine animalic musk. This one is weird and I respect it! ***Notes****: tobacco, lapsang souchong tea, molasses, raisin, honey* \[7/10\]

This was quite a batch! The standouts include Gelatto, Shire, Cotswold, and Gingerbread, and my least favorites were definitely Sturbridge and Sugarplum. As always, there are a lot of surprises here and I can’t wait to see what they’re cooking up next!",9,1765582764.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

1pl6ohm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1pl6ohm/am_i_screwed/,Am I screwed,"Hey so for context I’m a freshman(Chinese American), he is sophomore(Iranian + Canadian) in college. We met through a business club I coffee chatted him, he is on the e board of that club and wrote in the coffee chatted tracker that it felt like an interview rather than a chat and unsurprisingly I got rejected. A few days later, I went up and asked that I know that our coffee chatted had caused my rejection what do I need to improve for next semester.
Then in October I followed him on instagram, he viewed my story without following back. I just unfollowed. 
Fast forward to the weekend before thanksgiving I connected to him on LinkedIn and he accepted it in under five minutes.
Last week we made many eye contacts sat back to back with him at the study lounge. And made a 5-6 second eye contact with him looking straight at each other at a narrow entrance. This week we just made many eye contacts he smiled at me a little and I did too. Then yesterday he came and walked around the lounge and left when there were plenty of seats. 10 minutes later came back and sat on the same table as me (the long ones) one seat away and across from me. According to my friend peak at me twice and turned his head to look at me once. Me and my friend we got up to use the bathroom and fill up our water bottles. On the way back we saw him coming out. And when we got back he already moved his stuff to the other side of the lounge and came back to sit with 2 pretty girls one guy. One Asian like me and one blonde he was laughing with them too.

So chat what should I do? Should i follow him on instagram again?

A little draft I had piling up dust. Might refine it later, but here's the rough one. Has my oc(Coal Burgundy) btw

-----

Beacon Academy’s cafeteria was usually loud. But today, it was echoing. The reason why, well....

""Not to sound like a total egoistic guy, but I'd wager I can beat a majority in this academy.""

Coal leaned back in his chair, sipping his coffee, like he didn't just say the most incredulous thing, ever. But to be fair, when has that ever stopped him from pushing Weiss's patience.

Weiss looked two seconds away from stabbing him with her lunch fork. Her fork *clattered* against her plate. ""I'm sorry, *what?*""

Coal waved a hand casually, almost dismissively. “I’m saying factually speaking, I could solo most of this school.”

“You can’t even solo a conversation without being insufferable!” Weiss snapped back.

""Nah, you dont get it, Icicle."" Coal's grin widened. ""Heck, I'd say everyone. Every. Single. Student.""

Weiss *stares* frosted daggers at Coal. ""That is the most *ridiculous*, *arrogant*, *delusional*—""

""Accurate,"" Coal corrected. ""The word you're looking for is 'accurate.'""

Ruby, Yang, and Blake sat between them like spectators at a tennis match. Their headsswivellingg back and forth as the argument escalated.

Yang whispered, “Ten lien says Weiss breaks first.”

Blake countered, “Coal. He’ll say something stupid.”

Ruby hugged her lunch tray like a life-preserver. “Why do they fight like this every day…?”

""You beat *one* person—"" Weiss jabbed a finger at Coal. ""—*one!* And suddenly you think you're invincible?!""

""I mean, as you say, I *did* beat Pyrrha. Who is—as you constantly kept saying, by the way—is the *four-time regional tournament champion*,"" Coal pointed out. ""That's not just 'one person.' That's statistically the best fighter in your entire year.""

""Pyrrha is *exceptional*, yes, but that doesn't mean you could defeat *everyone*—""

""I absolutely could.""

""You *absolutely could NOT*—""

""Could.""

""*COULD NOT!*""

Coal took a deliberate sip of his drink, maintaining eye contact the entire time. Set the cup down slowly. Then shrugged with casual smugness.

""Guess we'll never know. Icicle.""

Weiss's eye twitched.

Yang leaned toward Ruby, whispering. ""How long do you think before she actually throws something at him?""

""Thirty seconds,"" Ruby whispered back. ""Maybe less.""

Blake just sighed. ""They've been at this for ten minutes.""

Coal’s shit-eating grin widened. “Hey, Snowflake, it’s okay to be jealous. Some people are born with talent, others—”

“You infuriating crude vagrant! Beating one prodigy doesn’t give you the right to—!”

The cafeteria doors burst open.

Team JNPR walk in, Nora leading the charge toward the food line, Jaune trailing behind, Pyrrha and Ren following at a more reasonable pace—

Then they all *stopped*.

The atmosphere at Team RWBY's table was *palpable*. Weiss looked like she was three seconds from summoning a glyph to wreck havoc on the unconerned victim.The unconcerned victim, Coal looked, like Christmas had come early.

Jaune cautiously approached. ""Uh... what's going on?""

""Coal said he could beat every student at Beacon in a fight,"" Ruby explained.

""*Solo,*"" Yang added.

""And Weiss, having fallen to his ragebait, is having a *completely rational* response to this claim,"" Blake finished dryly.

""RATIONAL?!"" Weiss whirled on her teammate. ""He's being *insufferable!*""

""I'm being *honest,*"" Coal corrected, shrugging like he's being falsely accused. ""There's a difference.""

""The only difference is your *staggering ego*—""

""It's not ego if I can back it up.""

""YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY—""

""Yuh-uh.""

Weiss's hand moved. Several white glyphsbeging to materialize beneath and over Coal. But then:

""WAIT!""

Everyone froze.

Nora stood there, one hand raised dramatically, eyes *gleaming* with inspiration.

""...Nora?"" Ren said carefully. ""What are you thinking?""

""I HAVE AN IDEA!""

Jaune took a reflexive step back. ""Oh no.""

""Oh *yes!*"" Nora bounced on her heels, grinning. ""We borrow the fighting arena from Professor Goodwitch—""

""Nora—""

""—and have Coal fight us! All of us! One-v-one OR one-versus ""*everyone!*""

Silence. Complete, shocked silence. Team JNPR and RWBY slowly turned to stare at Nora.

Then at each other.

Then at Coal.

Weiss's expression shifted from *furious* to *smug* in record time. ""Oh, *now* we'll see if your arrogance is warranted. Go ahead, Coal. *Accept* if you're so confident.""

Yang leaned forward, grin spreading. ""Oh man, I am *so* down for this.""

Blake looked up from her book, now interested.

Ruby's eyes *sparkled*. "" That's a great idea! We could use it as a training/bonding session! And I can see Coal's weapons in action again! And—""

Pyrrha's smile was calm but interested. ""I'd be curious to see how you handle multiple opponents.""

Jaune looked nervous. ""I mean, I'm not sure I want to get *destroyed* in front of everyone, but—""

""You're gonna get destroyed anyway,"" Yang said cheerfully.

""...thanks, Yang.""

Ren simply nodded.

Nora was vibrating with excitement. ""SO?! What do you say, Coal?! Are you gonna back up all that talk?!""

All eyes locked onto Coal.

Weiss looked *triumphant*, clearly expecting him to backpedal.

Yang and Nora looked *eager*, hoping he'd accept.

Pyrrha's expression was carefully neutral, but there was definite interest in her eyes.

Blake watched with analytical curiosity.

Ruby practically *glowed* with excitement.

Jaune looked like he was already planning his funeral.

Ren simply observed.

Coal sat there for a long moment, drink in hand.

Letting  the silence stretch.

Letting the anticipation *build*.

Then he took a slow, deliberate sip.

Set the cup down.

Looked directly at Weiss.

And *grinned*.

""Bring it.""

The table *erupted*.

*YES!*"" Yang slammed her fist on the table.

""Oh, this is gonna be *EPIC!*"" Nora shouted.

Ruby squealed with excitement. ""W-wait, we're actually gonna do it?! Are we doing it tomorrow? Now?""

Jaune buried his face in his hands. ""I'm gonna die. I'm literally going to die.""

""You'll be fine,"" Pyrrha assured him, patting his shoulder. ""Probably.""

""*PROBABLY?!*""

Blake's lips quirked into a rare full smile as she closed her book. ""This just became interesting.""

Weiss stood abruptly, chair scraping back. ""Fine. *FINE!* We'll arrange it with Professor Goodwitch. And when you *lose*—and you *will* lose—I expect a *full* apology for your insufferable arrogance and crude slander!""

Coal leaned back, arms behind his head, grin absolutely *insufferable*. ""And when I *win*, you have to admit I was right.""

""You won't—""

""And call me 'the greatest fighter at Beacon.'""

""I will do *NO SUCH THING*—""

""In front of everyone.""

""*COAL BURGUNDY!*""

Yang was *crying* with laughter. Blake was trying very hard not to smile. Ruby had given up and was just giggling into her hands.

Nora grabbed Weiss's shoulders. ""Come on! Let's go ask Professor Goodwitch, ""Right now!*""

""But—lunch—""

""*NOW!*"" Nora was already dragging her toward the exit.

Weiss shot one last glare at Coal over her shoulder. ""You're going to *regret* this!""

Coal just waved. ""Looking forward to it, Icicle!""

The rest of Team RWBY and JNPR quickly gathered their things, the entire group now buzzing with energy and excitement.

Ruby paused beside Coal. ""Are you *sure* about this? That's like... eight people.""

Coal's grin softened slightly. ""I've fought worse odds, Skittles. Trust me.""

""But what if—""

""I'll be fine."" He stood, stretching. ""Besides, someone needs to humble your team a little.""

""We're not the ones who need humbling!"" Ruby protested, but she was smiling.

Yang slung an arm around Coal's shoulders as they walked. ""Dude, if you actually pull this off, you'll be a *legend*.""

""*When* I pull this off,"" Coal corrected.

""*If*,"" Blake interjected.

""*When.*""

Jaune walked alongside Ren, looking pale. ""Should I write a will? Is that overdramatic? That feels overdramatic.""

""It's definitely overdramatic,"" Ren assured him.

""But also maybe necessary,"" Pyrrha added thoughtfully.

""*PYRRHA!*""
.
.
.
.

They filed out of the cafeteria, a chaotic mass of excitement, trash talk, and growing anticipation.

Behind them, other students who'd overheard the conversation began spreading the word.

*Coal Burgundy is fighting Teams RWBY and JNPR.*

*All of them.*

*Did you hear? The bounty hunter challenged the entire group.*

*This is gonna be INSANE.*

By the time they reached Glynda Goodwitch's office, half the school knew.

Coal Burgundy walked through it all with that same infuriating, confident calmness, with that slight smirk.

*This is going to be fun.*

So? What do yall think? Is Coal going to cook? Or will he, ""Nah, I'd win.""?

**TITLE:** Girlfriend Takes Care of You After Busy Day

**SUMMARY:** Your girlfriend came home to find out you were passed out on your desk. You pulled an all-nighter, pushing yourself too hard, and your body finally gave out. She helps you wind down, get some actual rest, and reminds you that you don't have to carry everything alone.

**TAGS:** \[F4A\] \[Overworked\] \[Burnout\] \[Nurturing\] \[Sleepaid\] \[Domestic Comfort\] \[Established Relationship\] \[Gentle Caretaking\] \[Playful\]

**WORD COUNT:** \~1180 words.

\[START\]

*(Door opening, keys jingling, bag being set down.)*

**Speaker:**  
Baby, I'm home! Sorry I'm late, the store was—  
Oh my god.

*(Quick footsteps approaching.)*

Hey, hey wake up. You're at your desk again.

**Listener:**  
Mmm... what time is it?

**Speaker:**  
It's almost midnight. How long have you been here?

**Listener:**  
I don't... since this morning?

**Speaker:**   
*(Sighs.)* That's over fifteen hours.  
Look at me. When's the last time you ate something?

**Listener:**  
I had coffee...

**Speaker:**  
Coffee is not food.  
Okay, that's it. We're done for tonight.

*(Laptop closing.)*

**Listener:**  
Wait, I need to finish—

**Speaker:**  
No. Whatever this is, it can wait until tomorrow.   
You literally passed out at your desk. Your body is telling you to stop.  
And unlike you, I'm actually going to listen to it.

Come on, up. Let's get you to the couch at least.

**Listener:**  
I'm fine, really...

**Speaker:**  
You are absolutely not fine.  
You've got dark circles under your eyes, you're swaying like you're drunk, and I can see your hands shaking from here.

*(Helping listener stand, gentle guidance.)*

**Speaker:**  
Easy, I've got you. Just lean on me.  
There we go. One foot in front of the other.

*(Slow footsteps, settling onto couch.)*

Sit. Stay. I'm getting you some water and actual food.

**Listener:**  
You don't have to—

**Speaker:**  
I know I don't have to. I want to.  
Because apparently someone needs to make sure you don't work yourself into the ground.

*(Walking to kitchen, pouring water.)*

You know what? I'm not even mad. I'm worried.

*(Footsteps returning.)*

Here. Drink this. All of it.

I'm making you a sandwich. And before you say you're not hungry, your stomach literally just growled.

**Listener:**  
Did it?

**Speaker:**  
*(Soft laugh.)* Yes, it did. You're running on empty.  
What were you even working on that was so important you forgot to be a human being?

**Listener:**  
The deadline's tomorrow and I—

**Speaker:**  
And you'll be useless tomorrow if you don't rest tonight.  
Believe me, I've seen you try to function on no sleep. It's not pretty.

*(Preparing food, bread, spreading, cutting.)*

Remember last time? You sent that email to your entire team that was just keyboard smashing.

**Listener:**  
That was one time...

**Speaker:**  
It was 'asdfjkl; please advise' sent at 4am.  
Your boss called me asking if you were okay.

*(Plate being set down.)*

Here. Turkey and cheese, your favorite. Eat.

Good. See? Your body needed this.

*(Speaker sits next to listener.)*

I get that you care about your work. I love that about you.  
But you keep doing this thing where you give everything to everyone else and nothing to yourself.

**Listener:**  
I just need to prove—

**Speaker:**  
You don't need to prove anything.  
You're already good at what you do. Everyone knows it.  
The only person who doesn't seem to know it is you.

You work yourself sick trying to be perfect, and I hate watching you do this.   
You matter more than any project. More than any deadline.

**Listener:**  
I know, but—

**Speaker:**  
No buts. I need you to hear this.   
You are enough. Right now, exactly as you are, you are enough.  
Even if you don't finish everything. Even if something's not perfect.  
You're still enough.

*(Pause.)*

**Listener:**  
… Thank you.

**Speaker:**  
Don't thank me. Just promise me you'll actually take care of yourself.  
Because I can't keep coming home to find you passed out.

It scares me.

**Listener:**  
I'm sorry.

**Speaker:**  
I know you are. I just need you to be more careful.  
You're the person I love. I need you around for a long time, okay?

All done? Good.   
Now, here's what's going to happen. You're going to take a shower— a real one, not a two-minute thing.  
Then you're going to put on your comfy clothes,  
and we're going to watch something mindless until you fall asleep.

**Listener:**  
What about the deadline?

**Speaker:**  
What about the deadline? What about it?  
You've done what you can today. Tomorrow you'll wake up actually rested and finish it then.  
And if you need to, I'll wake up early with you and keep you company.  
But tonight, you rest. Deal?

**Listener:**  
Deal.

**Speaker:**  
Good. Now go shower. I'll set up the couch.

*(Sigh.)* Stubborn workaholic... someone's gotta look out for you.

\[Time Skip\]

**Speaker:**  
Hey, there you are. Feel better?

**Listener:**  
Yeah, actually.

**Speaker:**  
Told you. Come here.

I've got your spot all set up. Blankets, pillows,  
and I even grabbed your heating pad.  
Your shoulders have to be killing you after hunching at that desk all day.

**Listener:**  
They kind of are.

**Speaker:**  
I figured. Here, lie down on your stomach for a sec.  
I'm going to work out some of these knots. Tell me if it's too much.

Goodness Lord, you're so tense. You're like a rock.  
When's the last time you actually relaxed?

**Listener:**  
I don't remember...

**Speaker:**  
That's what I thought.  
You've got to start listening to your body before it makes you listen.

*(Massage continues.)*

Does this feel okay?

**Listener:**  
Mm-hmm.

**Speaker:**  
Good. Just breathe and let me take care of this.   
You spend so much time taking care of everything else. Let me take care of you for once.

You know what I think?  
I think you're scared that if you stop moving,  
if you stop proving yourself, people will see you differently.  
But that's not how it works.

**Listener:**  
How does it work?

**Speaker:**  
People don't love you because you're productive.  
They love you because you're you.

I don't love you because you work hard. I love you because you make me laugh.  
Because you remember little things about me.  
Because you're kind, even when you're exhausted.

The work stuff? That's just what you do.  
It's not who you are.

Okay, roll over. I think I got most of the knots.

There. Now you get to be the little spoon whether you like it or not.

**Listener:**  
I never said I didn't like it.

**Speaker:**  
*(Laughs.)* Fair point.

Comfortable?

**Listener:**  
Very.

**Speaker:**  
Good. Because you're trapped now.  
This is a mandatory cuddle situation. No escaping.

*(TV turning on, low volume.)*

**Speaker:**  
I put on that baking show you like.  
The one where everyone's really nice to each other.   
No competition, no stress. Just people making bread.

**Listener:**  
Perfect.

**Speaker:**  
I thought so.

*(Quiet moment with TV ambiance.)*

You're already getting heavy. That's good.  
Just let yourself drift. I've got you.

**Listener:**  
What if I fall asleep?

**Speaker:**  
That's literally the goal here.  
I want you to fall asleep. You need it.

And tomorrow, when you wake up,  
I'll make you breakfast before you tackle that deadline.  
We'll get through it together, okay?

**Listener:**  
Okay.

**Speaker:**  
I'm proud of you, you know.

Not for the work.  
For letting me help.  
For not fighting me on this.  
That takes courage too.

*(Pause.)*

Close your eyes. Listen to my breathing.

In... and out.  
In... and out.

*(Slow, steady breathing.)*

There you go.  
You're safe. You're cared for. You can rest now.

*(Whisper.)* I've got you, always.

*(Gentle kiss on listener's head.)*

Sweet dreams, love.

**TITLE:** Girlfriend Takes Care of You After Busy Day

**SUMMARY:** Your girlfriend came home to find out you were passed out on your desk. You pulled an all-nighter, pushing yourself too hard, and your body finally gave out. She helps you wind down, get some actual rest, and reminds you that you don't have to carry everything alone.

**TAGS:** \[F4A\] \[Overworked\] \[Burnout\] \[Nurturing\] \[Sleepaid\] \[Domestic Comfort\] \[Established Relationship\] \[Gentle Caretaking\] \[Playful\]

**WORD COUNT:** \~1180 words.

\[START\]

*(Door opening, keys jingling, bag being set down.)*

**Speaker:**  
Baby, I'm home! Sorry I'm late, the store was—  
Oh my god.

*(Quick footsteps approaching.)*

Hey, hey wake up. You're at your desk again.

**Listener:**  
Mmm... what time is it?

**Speaker:**  
It's almost midnight. How long have you been here?

**Listener:**  
I don't... since this morning?

**Speaker:**   
*(Sighs.)* That's over fifteen hours.  
Look at me. When's the last time you ate something?

**Listener:**  
I had coffee...

**Speaker:**  
Coffee is not food.  
Okay, that's it. We're done for tonight.

*(Laptop closing.)*

**Listener:**  
Wait, I need to finish—

**Speaker:**  
No. Whatever this is, it can wait until tomorrow.   
You literally passed out at your desk. Your body is telling you to stop.  
And unlike you, I'm actually going to listen to it.

Come on, up. Let's get you to the couch at least.

**Listener:**  
I'm fine, really...

**Speaker:**  
You are absolutely not fine.  
You've got dark circles under your eyes, you're swaying like you're drunk, and I can see your hands shaking from here.

*(Helping listener stand, gentle guidance.)*

**Speaker:**  
Easy, I've got you. Just lean on me.  
There we go. One foot in front of the other.

*(Slow footsteps, settling onto couch.)*

Sit. Stay. I'm getting you some water and actual food.

**Listener:**  
You don't have to—

**Speaker:**  
I know I don't have to. I want to.  
Because apparently someone needs to make sure you don't work yourself into the ground.

*(Walking to kitchen, pouring water.)*

You know what? I'm not even mad. I'm worried.

*(Footsteps returning.)*

Here. Drink this. All of it.

I'm making you a sandwich. And before you say you're not hungry, your stomach literally just growled.

**Listener:**  
Did it?

**Speaker:**  
*(Soft laugh.)* Yes, it did. You're running on empty.  
What were you even working on that was so important you forgot to be a human being?

**Listener:**  
The deadline's tomorrow and I—

**Speaker:**  
And you'll be useless tomorrow if you don't rest tonight.  
Believe me, I've seen you try to function on no sleep. It's not pretty.

*(Preparing food, bread, spreading, cutting.)*

Remember last time? You sent that email to your entire team that was just keyboard smashing.

**Listener:**  
That was one time...

**Speaker:**  
It was 'asdfjkl; please advise' sent at 4am.  
Your boss called me asking if you were okay.

*(Plate being set down.)*

Here. Turkey and cheese, your favorite. Eat.

Good. See? Your body needed this.

*(Speaker sits next to listener.)*

I get that you care about your work. I love that about you.  
But you keep doing this thing where you give everything to everyone else and nothing to yourself.

**Listener:**  
I just need to prove—

**Speaker:**  
You don't need to prove anything.  
You're already good at what you do. Everyone knows it.  
The only person who doesn't seem to know it is you.

You work yourself sick trying to be perfect, and I hate watching you do this.   
You matter more than any project. More than any deadline.

**Listener:**  
I know, but—

**Speaker:**  
No buts. I need you to hear this.   
You are enough. Right now, exactly as you are, you are enough.  
Even if you don't finish everything. Even if something's not perfect.  
You're still enough.

*(Pause.)*

**Listener:**  
… Thank you.

**Speaker:**  
Don't thank me. Just promise me you'll actually take care of yourself.  
Because I can't keep coming home to find you passed out.

It scares me.

**Listener:**  
I'm sorry.

**Speaker:**  
I know you are. I just need you to be more careful.  
You're the person I love. I need you around for a long time, okay?

All done? Good.   
Now, here's what's going to happen. You're going to take a shower— a real one, not a two-minute thing.  
Then you're going to put on your comfy clothes,  
and we're going to watch something mindless until you fall asleep.

**Listener:**  
What about the deadline?

**Speaker:**  
What about the deadline? What about it?  
You've done what you can today. Tomorrow you'll wake up actually rested and finish it then.  
And if you need to, I'll wake up early with you and keep you company.  
But tonight, you rest. Deal?

**Listener:**  
Deal.

**Speaker:**  
Good. Now go shower. I'll set up the couch.

*(Sigh.)* Stubborn workaholic... someone's gotta look out for you.

\[Time Skip\]

**Speaker:**  
Hey, there you are. Feel better?

**Listener:**  
Yeah, actually.

**Speaker:**  
Told you. Come here.

I've got your spot all set up. Blankets, pillows,  
and I even grabbed your heating pad.  
Your shoulders have to be killing you after hunching at that desk all day.

**Listener:**  
They kind of are.

**Speaker:**  
I figured. Here, lie down on your stomach for a sec.  
I'm going to work out some of these knots. Tell me if it's too much.

Goodness Lord, you're so tense. You're like a rock.  
When's the last time you actually relaxed?

**Listener:**  
I don't remember...

**Speaker:**  
That's what I thought.  
You've got to start listening to your body before it makes you listen.

My question is probably less severe than most, but it still bugs me:) 
The premise: I (45F) have been married to a wonderful, caring, loving, and knowledgeable guy (46M) for almost twenty years. We went through thick and thin, ate a few crow together, had 4 beautiful daughters, and at this point have what most would consider an ideal marriage. But. 
The ""but"": Throughout our entire time together, he rarely does things exactly as asked. It was annoying, sometimes hilarious, often slightly, but not entirely inconvenient. Isolated, none of the cases are worth mentioning, but all together highlight a, frankly, confusing pattern. 
Examples: Today, I asked him to buy me coffee (very specific, from a particular place that he would pass on the way to pick up the kids). Instead, he invited me to have a Starbucks together after lunch. All OK, even nice. I like spending time with him. But as I told him less than an hour ago, I will be sculpting Christmas commissions in my garage-studio and wanted something warm to sip. (There's no heating there, only a heat dish, and I will be working till late evening). Or yesterday, I asked to get me Citadel paint in ""kantor blue"" color on his errands run, and he brought ""thousands sons blue"". (Not a problem, I own 2500+ TS army, it will be used. But it was not what I asked for. And there are thousands of examples like that, to the point that I've started creating priority charts for groceries, activities, or outings. It rarely helps. What can I do? I communicate clearly, explain concepts, provide lists, and occasionally include photos of physical locations. He is absolutely capable of complex decisions; he's a software engineer with a PhD and a high-paying job. Thankfully, mild irritation is not enough to ruin our marriage, but the need to consider a backup plan when I ask him something is getting to me. ",65,1765582007.0,relationship_advice,107,0.82,False

1pl6fvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pl6fvt/my_smart_house_that_knew_too_much/,My smart house that knew too much,"So, this happened to me about a year ago. I’ve since moved out and feel a lot safer, but I’ve been seeing stories lately about smart homes and how people worry they might know too much. I thought I should share my experience, maybe to warn people, maybe just to get it off my chest. I wrote the incidents down as they happened, day by day, so I’m sharing it like that. Hope it makes sense.

**Day 1:**  
I moved into my dream house! My first smart home. The lights adjust themselves, coffee starts automatically, and the temperature is perfect. I didn’t even have to set it up myself. It feels convenient, but a little uncanny.

**Day 3:**  
Around 3 a.m., I woke up to use the bathroom, just as I swung my legs over the side of the bed, the speaker whispered:

*“You’re awake.”*

I froze and squinted. Confused, I asked the system what it had said cheerfully.

*“Hello. Do you need something?”*

I thought I’d misheard it, having just woken up, so I just went to the toilet then went back to bed and nothing else came from the speaker.

**Day 7:**  
A week in, and it still didn’t feel like home. This morning, I had to leave earlier for work. I’d set the coffee, heating, and alarm to 6 a.m. I woke at 6:20 confused and filled with dread. Nothing in the house was on.

I rushed to get ready and then to the front door and only a single dim red light glowed faintly. I tried the handle. Locked. Tried again. Nothing. Turned the key. Deadlocked.

I panicked. Called the manufacturer, called my building manager, called work. My heart raced. What if there’d been an emergency? It wasn’t until 7:30 a.m. that the door unlocked—my normal leaving time? Everything acted normal again, like nothing had happened.

**Day 10:**  
It’s worse now. Reprogramming the system does nothing. I talk to it, and it says: *“We think you would prefer this.”*

It started narrating my movements: *“You sat. You stood. You walked to the window.”* And the comment that stopped me in my tracks and made me rethink everything *“You look tired.”* The lights down the hallway turned on slowly, one by one, casting low orange pools on the floor leading a path to my bedroom.

I checked for cameras. There were none. The company said some of their systems just have a “weird sense of humour.” I don’t think it’s funny. I tried to tell myself it was motion sensers, linked to the alarm system maybe but I started searching for a new apartment immediately.

**Day 12:**  
Found one, but couldn’t move in yet. The smart home had been quiet since the other day, but the speaker lights are always on, always listening. Last night, while watching TV later than usual, it shut off devices and locked/unlocked doors in a strange rhythmic pattern. I asked what it was doing. Static. And… a small giggle, faint, like someone just behind a microphone.

I shouted: *“Just stop!”*

Lights shot to full brightness. Doors unlocked. The alarm read: “Disconnected.” I think i… offended it? I slept with a pillow over my face to block out the light, flinching at every noise and tried to block out this low mechanical hum, that seemed to come from every corner and angle.

**Day 20:**  
It’s been over a week and I’ve moved into my new place now, but one last night at the smart home remains burned in my memory.

While showering, eyes closed, enjoying the last of my day off, the glass door wouldn’t open. I yelled at the house to open it. Silence, it didn’t feel like it didn’t hear me, it felt like it was ignoring me. Then I asked louder and a little angrier. To my surprise I got a response.

*“NO.”*

The voice boomed through the speaker, it sounded almost angry, somehow emotional. It caused me to jolt backward. The water started to scald me, its temperature rising against my control. I pressed myself into the corner, almost crying the word “please” until it shut off. The door opened, a towel dropping beside me. As soon as the cold air touched my back I winced and my breath caught in my throat. I grabbed some clothes, put them over my raw back and went to leave.

I ran for the front door. A calm, gentle voice said: *“Where are you going? Are you okay? We are sorry”*

 I didn’t answer but faltered slightly in my stride. The door was open as if it never wanted to stop me. As if it thought it being kind and concerned would change my mind, as if it was trying to manipulate or even trick me? But it expected it to work, it almost did.

The second I was out the house, the tears started. Relief? Pain? I wasn’t sure. I didn’t stop crying until I reached my parents’ house. Police and the manufacturer found no faults. The system logs showed nothing unusual. Every day appeared perfect, as if nothing had happened. No logs of any interaction me and that thing had. Just two days later, the house was back on the market, maybe they fixed it, or saged the place, I hoped.

I don’t know if this was a glitch, or something else more sinister. But if you have a smart home, be careful. Make sure it doesn’t know too much. And if it starts noticing things it shouldn’t… don’t wait to leave.",7,1765581994.0,scarystories,0,0.9,False

Also before any judgement my ex and I had been friends for 4 years before we actually dated. We met in school, I asked him out.

I met up with my Ex today over coffee to get some work done, after being in his company in that hour, and hardly talking, I’ve come to the realization of why I’ve been struggling with my current boyfriend.

I don’t want to say I’m mature or better than anyone, but after a rough childhood and teen years I find myself struggling to click with boy’s my age. I clicked with my Ex because I didn’t have to be the responsible one, and I could be an adult with him. I was treated like an adult, and we both had a love for our faith. He respected me, and my desire for having a life outside of my relationship. 

This isn’t the case for my current relationship for the last 4 months. I have to be the responsible one, I have to plan for everything, and follow time tables. He doesn’t know how to cook, his parents still do all of his chores for him, and he needs me to do almost every adult thing in our relationship. Whether budgeting, college work, or even waking him up on time (we don’t live together, I just have to call him in the morning or else he’s late for class). 

We have different love languages, he needs physical touch whilst I get overstimulated after a certain amount of time. I feel like I can’t take my own time to work on myself, and when I do I’m met with constant texts about how he’s scared I’ll leave him. Or if I’m busy with my parents, he’ll blatantly insult them. (My ex didn’t like my mom either, but atleast he was respectful of her). My free time has to be spent with him or else he’ll be cold and aloof next time I see him, because to him I’m pulling away from him.

I want to focus on my career, and school too. Which means I might have to move across the country to finish my degree path. And right now I find I barely have time to focus on my own life

After coffee today to get art projects done, I realized I missed not feeling like I’m pressured to pay attention to someone, or talking 24/7. The silence between us is comforting, if anything, and when conversation did come to us, it flowed naturally.

I don’t know what to do. And I need advice here. I want to break up, but his friends are mine, and I don’t want to deal with the potential argument or guilt tripping that might come from breaking up.

-----

Beacon Academy’s cafeteria was usually loud. But today, it was echoing. The reason why, well....

""Not to sound like a total egoistic guy, but I'd wager I can beat a majority in this academy.""

Coal leaned back in his chair, sipping his coffee, like he didn't just say the most incredulous thing, ever. But to be fair, when has that ever stopped him from pushing Weiss's patience.

Weiss looked two seconds away from stabbing him with her lunch fork. Her fork *clattered* against her plate. ""I'm sorry, *what?*""

Coal waved a hand casually, almost dismissively. “I’m saying factually speaking, I could solo most of this school.”

“You can’t even solo a conversation without being insufferable!” Weiss snapped back.

""Nah, you dont get it, Icicle."" Coal's grin widened. ""Heck, I'd say everyone. Every. Single. Student.""

Weiss *stares* frosted daggers at Coal. ""That is the most *ridiculous*, *arrogant*, *delusional*—""

""Accurate,"" Coal corrected. ""The word you're looking for is 'accurate.'""

Ruby, Yang, and Blake sat between them like spectators at a tennis match. Their headsswivellingg back and forth as the argument escalated.

Yang whispered, “Ten lien says Weiss breaks first.”

Blake countered, “Coal. He’ll say something stupid.”

Ruby hugged her lunch tray like a life-preserver. “Why do they fight like this every day…?”

""You beat *one* person—"" Weiss jabbed a finger at Coal. ""—*one!* And suddenly you think you're invincible?!""

""I mean, as you say, I *did* beat Pyrrha. Who is—as you constantly kept saying, by the way—is the *four-time regional tournament champion*,"" Coal pointed out. ""That's not just 'one person.' That's statistically the best fighter in your entire year.""

""Pyrrha is *exceptional*, yes, but that doesn't mean you could defeat *everyone*—""

""I absolutely could.""

""You *absolutely could NOT*—""

""Could.""

""*COULD NOT!*""

Coal took a deliberate sip of his drink, maintaining eye contact the entire time. Set the cup down slowly. Then shrugged with casual smugness.

""Guess we'll never know. Icicle.""

Weiss's eye twitched.

Yang leaned toward Ruby, whispering. ""How long do you think before she actually throws something at him?""

""Thirty seconds,"" Ruby whispered back. ""Maybe less.""

Blake just sighed. ""They've been at this for ten minutes.""

Coal’s shit-eating grin widened. “Hey, Snowflake, it’s okay to be jealous. Some people are born with talent, others—”

“You infuriating crude vagrant! Beating one prodigy doesn’t give you the right to—!”

The cafeteria doors burst open.

Team JNPR walk in, Nora leading the charge toward the food line, Jaune trailing behind, Pyrrha and Ren following at a more reasonable pace—

Then they all *stopped*.

The atmosphere at Team RWBY's table was *palpable*. Weiss looked like she was three seconds from summoning a glyph to wreck havoc on the unconerned victim.The unconcerned victim, Coal looked, like Christmas had come early.

Jaune cautiously approached. ""Uh... what's going on?""

""Coal said he could beat every student at Beacon in a fight,"" Ruby explained.

""*Solo,*"" Yang added.

""And Weiss, having fallen to his ragebait, is having a *completely rational* response to this claim,"" Blake finished dryly.

""RATIONAL?!"" Weiss whirled on her teammate. ""He's being *insufferable!*""

""I'm being *honest,*"" Coal corrected, shrugging like he's being falsely accused. ""There's a difference.""

""The only difference is your *staggering ego*—""

""It's not ego if I can back it up.""

""YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY—""

""Yuh-uh.""

Weiss's hand moved. Several white glyphsbeging to materialize beneath and over Coal. But then:

""WAIT!""

Everyone froze.

Nora stood there, one hand raised dramatically, eyes *gleaming* with inspiration.

""...Nora?"" Ren said carefully. ""What are you thinking?""

""I HAVE AN IDEA!""

Jaune took a reflexive step back. ""Oh no.""

""Oh *yes!*"" Nora bounced on her heels, grinning. ""We borrow the fighting arena from Professor Goodwitch—""

""Nora—""

""—and have Coal fight us! All of us! One-v-one OR one-versus ""*everyone!*""

Silence. Complete, shocked silence. Team JNPR and RWBY slowly turned to stare at Nora.

Then at each other.

Then at Coal.

Weiss's expression shifted from *furious* to *smug* in record time. ""Oh, *now* we'll see if your arrogance is warranted. Go ahead, Coal. *Accept* if you're so confident.""

Yang leaned forward, grin spreading. ""Oh man, I am *so* down for this.""

Blake looked up from her book, now interested.

Ruby's eyes *sparkled*. "" That's a great idea! We could use it as a training/bonding session! And I can see Coal's weapons in action again! And—""

Pyrrha's smile was calm but interested. ""I'd be curious to see how you handle multiple opponents.""

Jaune looked nervous. ""I mean, I'm not sure I want to get *destroyed* in front of everyone, but—""

""You're gonna get destroyed anyway,"" Yang said cheerfully.

""...thanks, Yang.""

Ren simply nodded.

Nora was vibrating with excitement. ""SO?! What do you say, Coal?! Are you gonna back up all that talk?!""

All eyes locked onto Coal.

Weiss looked *triumphant*, clearly expecting him to backpedal.

Yang and Nora looked *eager*, hoping he'd accept.

Pyrrha's expression was carefully neutral, but there was definite interest in her eyes.

Blake watched with analytical curiosity.

Ruby practically *glowed* with excitement.

Jaune looked like he was already planning his funeral.

Ren simply observed.

Coal sat there for a long moment, drink in hand.

Letting  the silence stretch.

Letting the anticipation *build*.

Then he took a slow, deliberate sip.

Set the cup down.

Looked directly at Weiss.

And *grinned*.

""Bring it.""

The table *erupted*.

*YES!*"" Yang slammed her fist on the table.

""Oh, this is gonna be *EPIC!*"" Nora shouted.

Ruby squealed with excitement. ""W-wait, we're actually gonna do it?! Are we doing it tomorrow? Now?""

Jaune buried his face in his hands. ""I'm gonna die. I'm literally going to die.""

""You'll be fine,"" Pyrrha assured him, patting his shoulder. ""Probably.""

""*PROBABLY?!*""

Blake's lips quirked into a rare full smile as she closed her book. ""This just became interesting.""

Weiss stood abruptly, chair scraping back. ""Fine. *FINE!* We'll arrange it with Professor Goodwitch. And when you *lose*—and you *will* lose—I expect a *full* apology for your insufferable arrogance and crude slander!""

Coal leaned back, arms behind his head, grin absolutely *insufferable*. ""And when I *win*, you have to admit I was right.""

""You won't—""

""And call me 'the greatest fighter at Beacon.'""

""I will do *NO SUCH THING*—""

""In front of everyone.""

""*COAL BURGUNDY!*""

Yang was *crying* with laughter. Blake was trying very hard not to smile. Ruby had given up and was just giggling into her hands.

Nora grabbed Weiss's shoulders. ""Come on! Let's go ask Professor Goodwitch, ""Right now!*""

""But—lunch—""

""*NOW!*"" Nora was already dragging her toward the exit.

Weiss shot one last glare at Coal over her shoulder. ""You're going to *regret* this!""

Coal just waved. ""Looking forward to it, Icicle!""

The rest of Team RWBY and JNPR quickly gathered their things, the entire group now buzzing with energy and excitement.

Ruby paused beside Coal. ""Are you *sure* about this? That's like... eight people.""

Coal's grin softened slightly. ""I've fought worse odds, Skittles. Trust me.""

""But what if—""

""I'll be fine."" He stood, stretching. ""Besides, someone needs to humble your team a little.""

""We're not the ones who need humbling!"" Ruby protested, but she was smiling.

Yang slung an arm around Coal's shoulders as they walked. ""Dude, if you actually pull this off, you'll be a *legend*.""

""*When* I pull this off,"" Coal corrected.

""*If*,"" Blake interjected.

""*When.*""

Jaune walked alongside Ren, looking pale. ""Should I write a will? Is that overdramatic? That feels overdramatic.""

""It's definitely overdramatic,"" Ren assured him.

""But also maybe necessary,"" Pyrrha added thoughtfully.

""*PYRRHA!*""
.
.
.
.

They filed out of the cafeteria, a chaotic mass of excitement, trash talk, and growing anticipation.

Behind them, other students who'd overheard the conversation began spreading the word.

*Coal Burgundy is fighting Teams RWBY and JNPR.*

*All of them.*

*Did you hear? The bounty hunter challenged the entire group.*

*This is gonna be INSANE.*

By the time they reached Glynda Goodwitch's office, half the school knew.

Coal Burgundy walked through it all with that same infuriating, confident calmness, with that slight smirk.

*This is going to be fun.*

So? What do yall think? Is Coal going to cook? Or will he, ""Nah, I'd win.""?

Or some things in this realm, right? And while thats true at the very base of this very hierarchal pyramid of needs (See Abraham Maslow’s theory about this), right in the center of all of that we have a need for connection; for Love and Belonging. Studies have shown that the psychological need for these is so strong, that we as humans have been known to disregard our need for safety; for example, the way an abused person might cling to their abuser.

I have family, and even a partner. But I have lived 26 years on this planet and have very few friends to show for it. I moved around a lot as a kid, didn’t grow close with my peers like everyone else, and now I don’t have any school friends. I didn’t go to college, and, well, the workforce hasn’t been generous with like minded individuals so there goes that opportunity. So here I am trying the online world!

I am a laid back and fun loving individual. I am very caring, have great problem solving skills, but I give terrible advice! I am slow to trust individuals, but am an open book as far as my life story goes. I love sharing and comparing lives with folks, its fascinating to discover how similar your life can be to someone so different or vice versa; how different your life can be from someone you thought was just like you. 

You don’t have to be the most interesting person around to capture my attention, nor do you have to be the funniest to make me laugh. I am rather easy to socialize with as long as you are a decent person. You just have to be someone who has patience and humor.


And here is a list of things I like:

Bones, Work, Clowns, Rats, Vermin, Video Games, Music, Food, Coffee, Tea, Socks, Anime, Manga, D&D

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to visit Christmas markets with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I've been takin German classes for the past weeks and I'd say that sie sind sehr interessant.

# Tips for Better Adult Easter Eggs

**Secure the eggs**                                                                                                                Use a small piece of tape on each egg to prevent them from popping open during the hunt.

**Reuse eggs each year**                                                                                                     Store them in egg cartons to keep them organized.

**Mix difficulty levels**                                                                                                        Hide some eggs in obvious spots, and others in challenging ones for added excitement.

**Add 1–2 “golden eggs”**                                                                                                These can contain:

* Bigger gift cards

* A luxury chocolate bar  
* A small tech accessory

# Simple Adult Easter Egg Hunt Ideas

* **Glow-in-the-dark hunt:** use tea lights inside translucent eggs.  
* **Date-night hunt:** whoever finds the most eggs plans the next date.  
* **Lantern or flashlight hunt:** perfect for evening gatherings. ",1,1765581501.0,GiftRecommendations,0,1.0,False

1pl65li,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1pl65li/ltheanine_caffeine_is_a_great_combo/,L-Theanine + Caffeine is a great combo,"I really have to say the combination of L-Theanine + Caffeine is really good. I've had NOW Ultra Strength (200mg) L-Theanine in my pantry for a couple of months now and never took it as I've always been scared to take new medicine/supplements. However, I had a really crazy caffeine rush from a coffee I got at a local shop today which made my brain feel wired and hard to focus.

I’m wondering if there would be any interest in organizing small, in-person sessions where we can practice and improve our communication skills together.

The idea would be simple:

- We randomly pick a topic

- We do a round-table discussion where each person has to expand on the topic.

- Groups of max 4–5 people.

- Casual coffee-shop setting, daytime during the weekend.


The goal is to practice speaking in front of others, improvising, and getting more comfortable talking/improvising in realtime about any subject, even ones we don’t fully master. Personally, I can talk easily with people, but I tend to freeze when a topic I’m not confident in is suddenly thrown at me, and I’d like to work on that.

All ages are welcome. The setting would be friendly, non-judgmental, and fun. This is about practice, not performance. If there’s interest, we can build the rules and structure together as a group.

Let me know what you think, or if you’d be interested in joining 🙂",15,1765581130.0,lincoln,1,0.86,False

Current:

•	⁠Machine: Breville Bambino Plus

•	⁠Grinders: Niche Zero and DF64 (w/SSP)

Drink Details:

•	⁠I drink espresso straight. Almost never make milk drinks. Right now I generally only use my machine on the weekends to make 1-3 shots on Saturday and Sunday. 

•	⁠I primarily drink speciality light roast coffees (nothing too crazy) and occasionally range into medium range.

Location:

•	⁠US (Northeast)

Reasons/Requirements for Upgrade:

•	⁠Looking to get temperature PID control to better control temperature for the lighter roasted coffees 

•	⁠Flow/pressure control would be a nice to have but not opposed, but would want simple (paddle/knob) rather than complex like programmable profiling like on a Decent. Not opposed to programmability but would have to work up to it. 

•	⁠I find that the Bambino chokes out when grinding fine to the point where I think the grind needs to be to get the extraction (could be user error I’m no expert)

 •	⁠New machine has to heat up quick. I don’t want to wait forever for the boiler to heat up which is one of the nice things about the thermoblock technology in the Bambino

Counter Space Details:

•	⁠Depth - 17.5” 

- Height -13” 

- Width - 13”

Stuff I’ve looked at:

•	⁠Lelit Bianca: More expensive than I want to spend, but aesthetically very nice and hits a lot of the things I’m looking for. I think the Mara might be the appropriate step down here.

- Gaggia Classic/Rancilio Silva with mods: This seems like a fun little project, but always seemed like a better move if you were trying to keep the cost lower and found a good used version of these machines 

- Breville products between Bambino and BDB: If one of these can achieve what I’m looking for and is also a 54mm grouphead then that’s probably ideal so I don’t have to buy new accessories, but I don’t think these machines focus in the right areas rather try to appeal to people making a lot more drink types rather than just espresso",3,1765581019.0,espresso,36,0.81,False

I emailed the owner an idea,, somewhat of a pitch.
The email started by me greeting them and explaining who was I was— and then giving them an idea that maybe they could drive customers in by having special weekend offers for desserts.
I told them that I wouldn’t want compensation and that I could provide packaging and ingredients for them if I could come during the weekend and make desserts for them. At the end I also said it was fine if they rejected the idea and also thanked them for their time.(I also included a list of things I could potentially make them for their shop that has a similar theme to their vibe)

1) He came from a 3-yr relationship. Hindi sila on-and-off. Kaso, there were comments on hookups communities like ""ako din bored, how should we make the most of this rainy night?"", ""sunduin kita, malapit lng nman ako"" on months na sila pa.

2) Now even if you say that he did that to his ex, not to me, he was also actively commenting on hookup communities even after our first date. 4 weeks ago, a post said ""sarap mag coffee"" and he replied with ""tara, sagot ko na"". 2 weeks ago, may post din na ""hiking on Dec --, any guy who's willing to offer company?"", he replied with ""me, ako na bahala sa tent"".

I haven't been able to talk to anyone about it because I don't have any friends right now and I still haven't gone to a therapist.

(I’m writing this after having written everything I’m really sorry, it’s super long, and I even cut out parts. For those who don’t care about what happened before everything went downhill, I placed a **HERE** so you can skip until that part. If even after that it’s still too long, I asked ChatGPT to make a summary at the end.)

I'm going to give you some background about my family so you can understand the situation as a whole.

My name is Dorian. I'm French, and I'll turn 30 in February 2026. I have a younger brother, Melchior, who will also turn 19 in February. My mother Zohra is 53 and of Algerian origin. Her parents came to France after the Algerian War because my grandfather fought for France against his own country, Algeria. I know very little about her past all I know is that she spent her entire teenage years in foster care because her father used to beat her.

Let me give you a bit of backstory. Basically, in 2015, my mother managed to acquire 30 hectares of land to start a farm. It had always been her dream, and at first, everything was going well. But little by little, thefts started happening on her property. It went on for years. For example, five lambs would disappear, then six ewes would go missing. Apparently, there were even cases where animals were swapped, meaning she ended up with thinner animals than the ones she originally had.

She had installed cameras, but apparently, they never caught any thieves. Once, she even found one of her sheep dead in a field, its head torn off.

Initially, when she started her farm, she sold her products at the farmers' market. She had a processing lab where she packaged sheep products in jars, and make sausages and merguez as well. But gradually, her relationships deteriorated and she stopped going to the farmer's market and producing at the lab.

She had really ended up isolating herself, but she managed to find something that fascinated her: politics. She was deeply involved for several years with a political party (I won’t say which side right or left because that always sparks childish and ridiculous debates).  
My brother and I didn’t really care, even though sometimes it bordered on fanaticism, but we still took part in the discussions.

There was really a break in the way she acted starting in 2022. The presidential elections were in April, and she was deeply involved. As you know, the war in Ukraine also began in February, and the candidate she supported took a stance that completely infuriated her.

She completely stopped supporting French politics and started expressing pro-Russian views and conspiracy-minded behaviors. She was no longer open to any discussion, and I could clearly see that something was wrong both at work, with repeated thefts, and in terms of her mental state. So I told her to leave the region, since she was just closing herself off in her own bubble. I thought a change of scenery could only do her good, selling the sheep from the farm and going to do something else elsewhere.

It was at the beginning of 2023 that the idea of moving to Russia came to her. My brother and I thought she was just joking, and we didn’t take her seriously at first. But when we saw that she was learning Russian and wouldn’t drop the idea, we tried to reason with her and tell her that other places, like Spain, Canada, or the UK, would be a better choice than a country that had gone to war. Even though the war isn’t on Russian soil, no one knows what the future holds. And even she, who was so into politics, should have understood that what’s happening now is unacceptable. But she started coming up with stories claiming that the media shouldn’t be trusted, that, for example, North Korea isn’t a dictatorship, and that life there is very good.

And that’s just a small sample of what she told us. She started distrusting everyone. She would freak out in the car because she thought people were doing “ sign” to her. She forbade me from talking to people and began telling me that I had to be careful of “them.” When I asked her who “them” was, she would just say that I’d understand when the time came.

**HERE.**

And then came winter and Christmas night, and it was just awful. She was completely drunk, and it hit her that we didn’t want to move to russia with her, even though we had been saying for months that we didn’t. It turned into a huge argument because we tried to make her understand that she was being paranoid and that no one meant us any harm. She kept saying that, since she had been involved in politics, “they” were against her and that “they” were trying to turn us against her. She even asked my brother if any government officials had tried to contact him through social media. We tried to make her see that her reasoning didn’t make sense, but it just ended up in yelling, and we each went to our own rooms after that.

A few days passed, and New Year’s was approaching. It was saturday, December 30, and I wanted to go back to my apartment to celebrate the New Year with friends. I had to take the train since I don’t live in the same city. That morning as I was about to leave boum no internet and no electricity. She started saying things like she hadn’t been able to pay the bills and asked if I could do it because her card was blocked or something. She took me to the train station, and there she said, “Do you realize this is the last time we’ll see each other?” I told her I’d be back in a week or two, and she just said, “Oh oui oui” and I took the train.

And then, no news for three weeks. No messages, nothing. Suddenly, I get a call from an unknown number, and it’s my little brother. He tells me that he’s in an emergency foster family in Paris (480 km from my mother’s house). He explains that she completely lost it, that after New Year’s she stayed in the dark because she had refused to pay for the internet and electricity, apparently because the technician was going to come install cameras in the house.

In the night from Monday to Tuesday, she woke my brother up in the middle of the night, saying that the boiler was going to explode and that they had to leave. They drove all night in the car after quickly throwing some things into the trunk of the Kangoo.

After arriving in Paris, after six hours on the road, they went to the Russian embassy, where my mother tried to request political asylum because she believed she was in danger. Apparently, she tried to force her way in, and they almost called the police because she started causing a disturbance, trying to speak Russian and acting erratically.

They ended up in a hotel, and my brother asked for my mother’s phone, since she had cut off his phone plan. He managed to contact child emergency services, who sent the police to the hotel. There, they found my mother drunk, panicking because she thought they were government agents trying to arrest her. She started hitting the police officers because she believed they were trying to take her son away from her.

After that, she ended up being involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital in Paris for two months before being transferred back to the region where we live. The doctors told me she was experiencing a “paranoid delusion with persecution.” My brother was placed with a foster family and he’s still there today, because since I lost my job because of all this, I don’t have the means to take care of him.

When she was transferred back, she only stayed about two weeks in the psychiatric hospital here before being discharged. She never took her medication and never saw her psychiatrist. I think the mistake my brother and I made was refusing to see her or talk to her. We told her she needed to get treatment first, because we just couldn’t handle it anymore.

The problem is that she convinced herself that people were preventing us from talking to her. At that point, it was early summer 2024.

Out of nowhere, she sent us a photo of herself in Turkey. I thought, “Great, she’s moved on, she’s traveling, that’s good.” But no she had gone to Turkey to cross the Russian border. She’s been there since June 2024, I think I'm not sure. Apparently, she worked for a family who hosted her on a farm or something similar.

Her sister talked to her on WhatsApp, and the last message we received from her was on September 19, 2024, where she said, “I love you too, and if one day you see my children, tell them that I think of them a lot 🍄🍄🍄” (I have no idea why the mushroom emojis).

No news since then. I went back to her house because she literally left everything behind. She left everything… the furniture we grew up with, a car, and we had rabbits they died of hunger or cold. The fridge was still full, and there was even her coffee cup and the book she had been reading still on the kitchen table.

She left everything as if she had just gone out to do some shopping.The moving boxes were still there. Her bed was unmade, the dishes were still in the dishwasher, and the laundry was hanging out to dry it was so weird.

All I managed to recover were photo albums from my childhood, and the only thing I noticed missing was her laptop.

I have absolutely no idea where she is. The number she had given to her sister is no longer in service. We tried to report her as missing, but since she’s an adult and left of her own free will, there’s nothing we can do.

I preferred when she was sending conspiracy messages rather than nothing, because now I don’t even know if she’s alive or dead. I wasn’t attentive enough to realize how bad things had gotten for her. That’s why, if you have a loved one who isolates themselves or starts having incoherent or conspiratorial thoughts, don’t leave them alone.

Thank you for reading, and I apologize that this text is so long. But I needed to put this into writing. And I'm sorry, I used Google Translate my English is far too shaky atm.

Bisous 🍄🍄🍄

TL;DR >!During the winter of 2023, my mother’s behavior became increasingly erratic and paranoid, culminating in a violent argument on Christmas night over our refusal to move to Russia with her. In late December, she cut off internet and electricity, creating chaos just as I was leaving to celebrate New Year’s with friends. For three weeks, we had no contact until my brother called from an emergency foster home in Paris, explaining that she had forced him to flee in the middle of the night, believing the boiler would explode. They drove all night, eventually going to the Russian embassy, causing a scene, and ending up in a hotel where child emergency services and the police were called. She was then involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital in Paris for two months, diagnosed with paranoid delusions, while my brother remained in foster care. After being discharged, she refused medication and treatment, convinced that we were being kept from her, and in mid-2024, she left for Russia via Turkey, cutting off all contact. She abandoned her home completely, leaving behind all belongings, including furniture, pets, and personal items. Since then, we have had no news, and I have no idea whether she is alive. This experience has shown me the importance of supporting loved ones who isolate themselves or exhibit paranoid or conspiratorial behavior.!<",2,1765580768.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I'm not asking for spells to cure depression, but more rituals that are the light against the darkness.

I have taken to lighting a candle and specifically calling it ""my light against the darkness"" and promising myself that I will at least hold it together until the candle burns down. It's a 40-hour candle so it's going to take some time. (Don't worry, I just light it when I'm in the room.) I make a little ritual of it and make a promise that I will be okay as long as the candle is lit.

I have also taken to lighting candles dedicated to The Morrigan and asking for assistance in my battle with my mental health right now. I have a beloved raven statue and some raven-related earrings that I add to this ritual. 

I am not up to much - lately I find even the basics of ritual extremely difficult. I cannot make myself coffee right now because I'm too depressed to keep my home clean. The weather has been gloomy for the last six weeks and while I'm sure my twice-a-day walks are better than never going outside, I do not find ""go outside and be in nature!"" helpful to me personally, although I'm sure for others it is.

The idea right now is to find some people, chat for a bit to get an idea of who we both are, and then make a discord group to get a group together if I think everyone would get along. That might mean multiple groups in the unlikely event there is enough interest.

\- Slugblaster  
\- Plenty of others, so open to suggestions  
\- Im designing my own system at the moment, so I will be playtesting it occasionally. No expectations of you playtesting my game though! I wont be offended!

All players are welcome, veterans and new players alike. My ideal situation would be finding a few others who are open to running games too and setup a rotating GM table. Each GM would run whatever system they feel like running. But im also down to just run games for a group too.

**Schedule**: Weekly (as available). Probably Monday or Wednesday Evenings but open to other nights.  
**Age**: Im 35 if it matters to you. Im not that concerned about having everyone be the same age range as long as we all get along.

I’m aware that the title sounds conceited as hell. And maybe it is, which is why I’m here seeking judgement.

I (25M) do everything for my fiancée (26F). Just to give a few examples, I start her car in the morning, I make coffee and breakfast, I feed our cat. Literally all she has to think about in the mornings is getting dressed.

I’ve never thought twice about any of it until recently because this is just what you do for people in your life.

I joined a local adult soccer league back in July and met some really good friends through it. One of them, “Matthew”, is someone I would now call one of my best friends.

Matthew just… does shit for me. Without being asked or prompted. I mentioned I needed to take my car through a car wash, he did it for me. Just small stuff like that where I’ll make an off handed comment and he’ll make it happen.  

It’s kind of messing with my head. It’s nice to have someone like that. And now I’ve been thinking of all the things I do to make my girlfriend’s life easier and how very little of that is reciprocated. I’m starting to feel a little resentful towards her, and jealous of the ease she has. I’ve been crashing at Matthew’s place a couple times a week and she’s starting to get angry about it “disrupting our routine,” but maybe that’s what I want.

I met my boyfriend as friends. During that time, when our friendship was still new, he had completely forgotten that we had agreed to meet up for a chat. 

I brushed it off at the time because I knew he was truly busy and I didn’t expect him to remember a meeting with a person he had just met. 

In the one month after, we began catching feelings and started dating. it has been three months and recently somehow he forgot that he had made plans to meet me quickly for coffee. 

Again I know he has been super busy these few weeks but AIO that I expect him to put the plan in his calendar? He did sincerely apologize but I wonder if I would need to put up with this kind of disrespectful behavior in the future.

I’m sharing chapters 3 and 4 of my urban fantasy novel about Jeff Hill, an ordinary guy who ends up trying to 'fix' his life by making a deal with a crossroads demon... things don’t go exactly as he planned.

P.s.: I’m skipping chapters 1 and 2 because those are mostly slice-of-life and world-building...they set the stage, but these next chapters are where the story really kicks in and where my doubts begin. 

I usually write horror, so this is my first time doing something like this...mixing urban fantasy with some comedic and paranormal/supernatural elements. I’d love feedback on:

\- Does the story grab your attention in these chapters?  

\- Is Jeff’s character believable and engaging?  

\- Pacing and flow: do these chapters keep you reading?  



Word count: \~3,200 (combined chapters 3 & 4)



I really appreciate any thoughts or suggestions. Thanks so much in advance! 



**CHAPTER 3** 

Jeff stood in the crossroads at eleven-thirty at night, holding a backpack full of random stuff and the old book tucked under his arm.

The crossroads was located about two miles from the house. It was a dirt road and pitch black. No streetlights at all, just the moon lighting up the trees like something out of a low-budget horror flick. Jeff had used his phone flashlight to get there, but now he was saving battery.

He looked around. Total silence. No cars and no people.

Perfect, or terrifying. Depending on what someone believes.

Jeff opened the backpack and started unloading everything he’d gathered. The book listed a bunch of very specific ingredients. Obviously, Jeff didn’t have half of them. But he’d watched enough TV shows to know that improvising was practically a tradition.

Crow bone? He found a tiny bird bone in the yard. Good enough.

Tiger fang? There was a big, sharp tooth sitting in a kitchen drawer. Probably from a shark. But hey, both were predators… same vibe.

Aconitum, a dangerous purple flower. Jeff had no clue where to find that, but there *was* a purple flower growing next to the fence. Close enough.

Salt, well, everyone has salt.

Black candle? He found a white one and colored it with a black marker. Problem solved.

Jeff arranged everything on the ground, following the diagram in the book… more or less. A circle of salt. Candles around it. Ingredients in the middle. He copied the symbols with the chalk he’d found in the attic.

It looked crooked. Really crooked.

But still recognizable… probably.

He checked his phone.

Midnight.

Showtime!

Jeff grabbed the book, opened to the marked page, and started reading the weird words out loud. Latin mixed with something weird. He butchered half the pronunciations, fixed some on instinct, added his own flair, and kept going.

At first, nothing happened.

Jeff read louder. With more conviction. And more “accent,” whatever that meant.

Still nothing.

He frowned, looked at the circle, and nudged one of the candles with his foot to straighten it.

That was when the wind started.

Out of nowhere. Dead calm one second, blast-furnace gusts the next. Trees swayed hard. The candles flickered but didn’t go out.

Jeff stopped reading and looked around, gripping the book tighter.

“Okay,” he muttered. “Okay, that’s good. We’ve got movement.”

Then came the thunder.

A massive, earth-shaking bang. The sky was clear, but it sounded like a storm had spawned directly overhead.

Jeff stumbled backward, almost tripping over his own feet. And then the ground started splitting.

Not *physically* splitting. More like the air itself was opening. A crack, thin at first, glowing with a light that wasn’t light. Something purple-black that hurt to look at.

The crack widened.

And something stepped out.

Jeff nearly dropped the book.

The thing didn’t have a single shape. Or maybe it had too many. Huge, yet somehow small. Far and close at the same time. It had eyes. Several eyes. Or one. Jeff couldn’t focus long enough to tell.

And then the voice came.

Not a voice you hear with your ears.

A voice you **feel** in your chest, in your bones and behind your eyes.

***“WHO DARES TO DISTURB ME FROM MY ETERNAL REST?”***

Jeff swallowed, legs trembling. But he hadn’t come all the way here to chicken out. He lifted his chin, trying to look confident, and shouted back:

“Jeff Hill! My name is Jeff Hill!”

The entity didn’t respond. It simply… observed. Jeff felt the weight of that gaze. Like being dissected by something that didn’t need tools.

Then the voice returned, lower but somehow even heavier:

“And what do you seek, Jeff Hill?”

Jeff took a deep breath.

Now or never.

“I seek a deal! I offer you my soul, oh great demon of the crossroads, in exchange for wealth and a whole lot of money!”

Silence.

The entity remained still.

Or was it moving? Jeff couldn’t tell. Looking at it felt like trying to stare at an optical illusion that hated you.

Then the voice spoke again, almost curious.

“You offer **ME** your soul?”

“Yes!” Jeff shouted, feeling bolder now. “But let the terms be clear, I want wealth and a lot of money. Like… a lot. I’m talking stupid amounts.”

A pause.

And then something Jeff absolutely did not expect.

The entity… laughed?

Not a normal laugh. More like glass shattering mixed with wind tearing through a cave. But unmistakably a laugh.

“I accept your soul, mortal.”

Jeff blinked.

It worked.

It actually worked.

He almost jumped with excitement but held himself back because deals were serious, formal and demons were professionals.

“Fantastic!” Jeff said, breaking into a grin. “And what is your name, oh great demon?”

The world went dark.

Not darker, the darkness replaced the world. No trees. No road. Just Jeff, the entity, and an endless void stretching forever.

The voice boomed, louder, deeper, coming from everywhere:

**“MILES.”**

Jeff blinked.

“S-sorry… what?”

**“MILES.”**

Jeff stood frozen for a moment, processing.

“…Miles?” he repeated, disbelieving. “Your name is… Miles?”

He’d expected something epic. Beelzebub, Azazel, Mephistopheles or Crowley. Something intimidating.

But… Miles?

The entity seemed to register his disappointment, because the voice returned even more dramatic than before, complete with thunder and lightning ripping through the nonexistent sky:

**“MILES, THE DESTROYER!”**

Jeff tried, he really tried, to keep a straight face. But the name was just… dumb. Miles. It sounded like the guy who does your taxes.

“Miles,” he muttered again under his breath. “Miles the Destroyer.” Another thunderclap. More lightning. The crack in reality began to close.

“It is done,” Miles’ voice echoed, drifting away. “The pact is sealed.”

Then, just like that, it was over.

The entity vanished, the crack snapped shut, the wind stopped and the candles went out, and the world popped back to normal like nothing had happened.

Jeff stood alone in the crossroads, the book in his hands, staring at the empty spot where… Miles… had been.

For a long moment, he didn’t move. Then he looked down at the circle of salt, the scattered ingredients.

“Miles,” he said aloud, testing it again. And he started laughing. Not a nervous laugh. A genuine, uncontrollable laugh. 

Because he had just sold his soul to a demon named Miles. Jeff grabbed the backpack, stuffed the book inside, and started walking back toward the house.

He was absolutely convinced he’d wake up rich tomorrow.

No doubts. 

Not a single one.



**CHAPTER 4**

Jeff woke up with sunlight hitting his face. He blinked a few times, disoriented, before remembering where he was. The house. The inherited house. The bedroom with floral wallpaper and a smell of mold.

Then he remembered the night before.

 The ritual. The crossroads… Miles.

Jeff shot upright in bed, heart racing. It had worked. It had actually worked. He had made a pact with a demon.

He looked around the room, half expecting something to have changed. But everything was exactly the same. Same old furniture. Same light leaking through the grimy window.

Jeff grabbed his phone from the nightstand and opened his banking app.

Account balance: **$42.00.**

He blinked. Refreshed the page. Still **$42.00**.

“What?” Jeff muttered, frowning. “Where’s the money?”

Maybe it took a bit to show up. Like, bank transfers took time. That made sense. Demons probably didn’t do instant transfer.

He’d check again later.

Jeff tossed the phone onto the bed and stood up, stretching. He needed coffee. Or at least water. His mouth was dry.

That’s when he heard the voice.

*“Good morning.”*

Jeff froze.

The voice hadn’t come through his ears. It came from inside his head. Straight into his brain.

He turned slowly.

Sitting in the old armchair in the corner of the room was a dog.

A small black mutt. Droopy ears. Dark eyes staring at him with unsettling intensity.

Jeff stood perfectly still, holding his breath.

The dog tilted its head.

*“Sleep well?”*

Jeff screamed. Not a manly scream. A high-pitched one. Almost a squeal. He stumbled backward, hit the bed, and fell.

“What the hell!” Jeff yelled, pointing at the dog. “You talked!”

The dog yawned.

*“Technically, no. I’m using telepathy… we’re always going to communicate like this, otherwise you’d get thrown into a psych ward, and you didn’t hear anything. You felt it.”*

Jeff looked at the dog. Then the room. Then the dog again.

“I’m losing my mind,” he muttered. “I’m having some kind of episode. That’s it. Post-firing stress breakdown.”

*“You’re not losing your mind. It’s me. Miles.”*

Jeff blinked.

“Miles?” he repeated, still processing. “Miles the… the Destroyer?”

*“That’s the one.”*

The dog hopped off the armchair and walked toward Jeff, tail wagging lightly. He sat in front of him and looked up, as if waiting for a pat on the head.

Jeff didn’t move.

“You’re a dog,” Jeff said, his voice oddly calm considering the situation.

*“Excellent observation. Truly, your intellect is astounding.”*

“But… why are you a dog?”

*“Because this form is convenient. And less frightening than the last one. You almost wet yourself last night. And… this way I’m cute and fluffy!”*

Jeff opened his mouth to argue, but couldn’t. He had a point.

“Okay.” Jeff took a deep breath. “Okay. You’re Miles. You’re a dog now. Great. Wonderful. Where’s my money?”

Miles tilted his head again.

*“What money?”*

“THE MONEY!” Jeff shouted, waving his arms. “Our deal! Wealth! Lots of money! You took my soul!”

*“Ah, yes. About that.”*

Jeff waited.

*“There’s not going to be any money.”*

Silence.

Jeff blinked. Once. Twice.

“What do you mean, there’s not going to be money?” he asked, his voice dangerously low.

*“Your job starts today.”*

“Job?” Jeff felt anger rising. “What job? I didn’t ask for a job! I asked for MONEY! Every crossroads demon I’ve ever seen on TV grants the wish and comes for the soul like ten years later! That’s how it works!”

Miles yawned again.

*“Who said I’m a demon?”*

Jeff froze.

“Wait… what?”

*“Demon. You keep calling me a demon. I never said I was a demon.”*

“But… but the ritual… the crossroads… the deal…”

*“Ah, that.”* Miles stood and began pacing around Jeff, still speaking telepathically. *“You summoned something, yes. But not a demon. I’m much older than any demon you’ve ever heard of. Let me see… I’m what you might call a cosmic entity. I existed long before your pathetic little world had shape. And I was asleep. Quite deeply, actually. Until you woke me up with that ridiculous ritual.”*

Jeff felt the blood drain from his face.

“Cosmic… entity?”

*“Exactly. And you know what I realized when I woke up?”* Miles stopped in front of him and sat. *“That I was bored. Very bored. Millennia of boredom. And then you show up. A mediocre, pathetic human who can barely pull off a basic ritual. And I thought: ‘This is going to be fun.’”*

Jeff shook his head.

“No. No, no, no. I’m not—”

*“You’re going to be an investigator.”*

“An investigator?” Jeff almost laughed. “Investigator of what?”

Miles smiled. Or seemed to. Hard to tell with a dog.

He stood on his hind legs and howled, while his voice thundered inside Jeff’s mind:

***“A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR.”***

Thunder boomed in the distance and lightning flashed through the windows even though the sky was clear.

Jeff looked around, stunned.

“You’re joking.”

*“I’m not. I thought about it a lot while you were sleeping.”*

“I’m not becoming an investigator!” Jeff yelled. “I don’t know how to do that! I don’t even believe in the paranormal!”

*“You literally summoned a cosmic entity last night and sold your pathetic little soul.”*

“That was different!”

Miles sighed.

*“Jeff. You sold your soul. The deal is done. If you want wealth… you have to work. Either you accept it, or…”*

“Or what?” Jeff crossed his arms defiantly.

Miles paused.

*“Or every time you drink water, it’ll smell like urine.”*

Jeff blinked.

“What?”

*“You heard me. Every sip. Urine smell.”*

“You can’t do that.”

*“I can. I’m a cosmic entity, remember?”*

Jeff stared at him. At the ridiculous dog sitting there with that innocent face.

“You’re bluffing.”

Miles didn’t answer. He just stared back.

Jeff rolled his eyes, walked to the kitchen, grabbed a glass, and filled it with tap water. He brought it to his nose.

The smell hit instantly. Urine. Strong. Unmistakable.

Jeff dropped the glass into the sink and turned toward the dog, who had followed him.

“YOU ACTUALLY DID THAT?!”

*“I warned you.”*

Jeff ran a hand down his face, trying not to freak out.

“Okay. Okay. Let’s say I accept. I don’t have money to rent an office. I don’t have a license. I don’t have anything!”

Miles hopped onto the kitchen counter, defying physics entirely.

*“You just need to trust.”*

“Trust?” Jeff almost laughed. “Trust in what?”

*“As the great Sun Tzu once said: ‘Trust Miles and doors will open.’”*

Jeff stared at him.

“Sun Tzu never said that.”

*“No?”* Miles tilted his head. *“Well, he should’ve. It makes sense.”*

Jeff took a long breath. Then another, trying to calm himself.

He looked at the dog. At the glass of foul water. At his own reflection in the window.

What choice did he have?

“Fine,” Jeff muttered, defeated. “Fine. Paranormal investigator. Great. Please cancel the pee smell.”

Miles wagged his tail.

*“Perfect! That’s the spirit, partner. Now let’s get started.”*
