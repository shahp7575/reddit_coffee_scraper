1mziwxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mziwxr/aitah_for_not_wanting_custody_of_my_granddaughter/,AITAH for not wanting custody of my granddaughter,"My son is an addict. Hes been on and off drugs for the last 15 years. He has a serious gaming addiction also. He had 3 children with his ex. He went to jail and the mother was severely addicted. The children were taken into CAS (CPS) custody. I applied for kinship and lost midway through the process because 1, the children are half native and they wanted the kids to stay within the community and we were 4 hrs away. 2, i said my son could come home after jail (so he could continue the progress hed made and he had nowhere else to go) but told Cas id kick him out of need be. They ghosted me but not before twlling me that everytime i had a video chat with my Granddaughter, after she would have a fit, so i let go to let her heal and adjust to life with her maternal granmother. 

Fast forward 4 years and my son and girlfriend were homeless in active addiction, they get pregnant. Found a place to live. Seemed to be sober. I was resistant to become involved in the baby's life and knew they were in no position to take care of a child given their history, but i always had hope my son would find his way. In the last few weeks of pregnancy they had an argument and she took off. Ended up in the hospital and tests came back positive for drugs. 

Fast forward one year, i have come around to having contact with them all. Have bonded with my Granddaughter. Knew they still had their issues. And now, last week, they asked if we could take her for a few days because they're stressed out.  We're like ""of course"" next thing i get a call from CAS asking how long we'll be taking her for and activities etc as my son and SO asked for ""respite"" we were asked to drop her off at her great grandmothers 40 minutes away. Had a convo with her and found out that they made comments that ""they cant take care of the baby"" ""that they dont have enough food for themselves"". My sons SO unfriended me on facebook and the both have been MIA for 4 days. Not responding to my messages. 

I remeber my son, 5 years ago, calling me and saying he called CAS and told them they couldnt take care of the babies and told them i would take them. I told him then that we were in no position to take care of 3 babies. I would have to quit my job and even with the money the agency would give us it still wouldn't be emough to provide for them, pay for rent amd food for everyone, including our younger daughter. 

This time, (as both my husband and the maternal great grandmother feel they're giving up custody of her) i am unemployed, laid off after 6 years and and finding work in my feild is borderline impossible. We still have our daughter to look after. And honestly, after being a parent since 18 (now 47) i want to be a grandparent, not a parent. I have medical issue and my own mental health issues to contend with. Just having her for 2 days im exhausted and i can see myself falling into bad parenting habits of letting her sit in her high chair a few minutes longer so i can have a smoke (i can see her constantly and am at the door only 10 feet away) i put her to bed with a bottle (apparently you're not supposed to do that anymore) when i wake up i have a smoke, get my coffee ready and her food and then get her up...i feel guilty and ill equipped to parent a 1 year old properly 24/7 365 for another 18 years. Im at an age where i want to be selfish and be an adult. I never had that, going from a child immediately into parenthood. I wasnt a bad parent, but i wasnt the best...AITAH for not wanting this.",1,1756102769.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

And I'm still not entirely sure if I have or not.


Last Halloween, I met a girl my age and from my area on the bus home at the end of the night. We hit it off pretty great and spoke the whole way home. Found out we have a lot of common interests, and that she goes to a weekly D&D night in the next city over that I was also about to start going to.


Unfortunately, I currently work out of the country, so I'm only back home 1 week per month. And even more unfortunately, she doesn't use social media all too often, so my communication with her is mostly limited to when I'm home. However, every Wednesday on the bus home, we still end up chatting the entire 40 minute journey. So in total, I've spoken to her in person about 7 or 8 different times now.


In June, we were supposed to both be going to the same local nerdy convention, but she had to pull out last minute. It just so happened to also be her birthday that same weekend, so when I was at the con I grabbed her a set of D&D dice and a little necklace that also had mini dice inside. I gave them to her in July, and she seemed to be thrilled with them. And then next time I was out of the country for work, I began to get a few more replies on social media than usual.


Finally, a week and a half ago, I mustered up the courage to ask her on the bus home if she'd be free to grab a coffee before I went away again, and she said yes. The following day we met up in a local cafe and ended up talking non stop for about 4 hours, only ending because we were cut short by the cafe closing for the evening. I had some shopping to do before I went home, but offered to drop her back to her house beforehand. However, she actually offered to join me on my shopping trip instead, and heavily insisted when I tried to tell her that wasn't necessary.


Now, to whoever's reading this, maybe that sounds like the most date-like date to ever be dated. But unfortunately I think my lack of dating experience at my age has set a deep rooted doubt into my head that I'll never actually go on one, and that this is just a really good friendship instead.


I completely understand that the best thing to do would likely be to simply talk to her directly about this, however she's still a little hard to reach online and I won't be home again for another 2 weeks, and the thought of waiting that long is absolutely torturing my brain.


So for the time being, I'll accept a little bit of outside perspective from some internet strangers to help settle my mind and heart. 
I've most likely forgotten to include some details so please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. I'll edit this if anything further come to mind.

So here’s the deal — I’m 30m, and recently landed in Guelph when I bought a house in North Guelph. Great city, but my social life here is basically me, the gym, and the guy at Tim Hortons who already knows my order. Time to change that.

About me:
	•	Work in cybersecurity (yes, I’m the guy who says “don’t click that link” while secretly clicking random memes myself).
	•	Into lifting, climbing, and staying active — but equally down for good food, lazy coffee shop hangs, or Netflix marathons.
	•	Love road trips, random deep convos, and trying new spots around the city.

If you’re also in Guelph and think “making friends as an adult is harder than parking downtown,” then we’re already on the same page. Let’s grab a coffee, hit the gym, or just complain about the traffic circle at Stone & Edinburgh.

He got up and walked up to my car and told me to roll the window down and I locked the car and kinda ignored him because I didn’t feel safe. He was banging on the window telling me to roll it down and he punched the window hard but didn’t break it. I eventually got pissed off so I rolled down the window and asked the dude what the fuck he wanted. 

He then tried to open my door to get inside and i grabbed his hand and yanked it out the window so he doesn’t get inside my car and then I rolled up the window and flipped him off and locked the car again.

He then decided to kick my car in anger and then I got out the drivers seat and into the passengers seat I rolled down the window and I pushed him hard to the ground and then I crawled into the drivers seat as he got up and yelled “WHAT THE FUCK DUDE!” and I sped off

Nintendo’s on some next-level control freak nonsense. First they wiped **Yuzu** off the face of the earth, then came for **Ryujinx**. Poof. GitHub gone, Discord nuked, devs probably sweating through their Joy-Con-colored hoodies.

But plot twist, Ryujinx is **back**. Not on GitHub, not on Discord, but on their own site now: [https://ryujinx.app/](https://ryujinx.app/). Fully open source, fully working, and still running **better than a real Switch** in a lot of cases. You can throw *Tears of the Kingdom* on a Steam Deck and it plays smoother than the console it was made for.

So here’s my idea. Let’s rally up all the **casual gamers** out there, the ones who just wanna play games and don’t care about legal drama. Show them how easy it is to run stuff like Ryujinx on Steam Deck or PC. No piracy needed. Just your own game dump, real hardware keys, clean setup, and boom, you're good.

If enough people stop using official Switch hardware, **the Nintendo executives are gonna cry into their Mario-themed coffee mugs**. They want full control over what you play, how you play, and when you play it. And they really hate that we have options now.

So yeah, let’s spread the word. Not like “hacking tutorial” level stuff, just real talk. Casual-friendly guides. Chill tone. Maybe some memes. Just enough to get people asking “Wait, I can play that on my Steam Deck?”

Let the lawyers cry. Let the suits cry. Let the Karens cry.  
We just wanna play games without getting babysat by a EULA.

I’m curious by nature and a little explorative by heart, whether it’s discovering a hidden café or getting lost in a deep conversation about life, art, or the human mind.

I’m 5’6”, slim, stylish, and confident—with a soft spot for guys who embrace their masculinity but can still be kind, witty, and attentive. The type who can handle a little sass, match my curiosity, and maybe even teach me something new.

Also, I’m a transwoman—just putting it upfront, because honesty is the best filter. (My photos/video on my profile) 

You: Fit or within a healthy BMI, clean, and effortlessly charming. If you’ve got a strong presence, a warm smile, and that I’ve-got-this energy—oh, I’m listening. Adventurous and youthful in spirit? Even better.

When you message, drop your ASL, a short intro, and something unique about you. Surprise me.

Let’s skip the small talk and explore what happens when creative meets masculine. Could be coffee… could be more. 🌙💬",0,1756101470.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.5,False

Hello folks, it’s me again.

During the process of building [**Clipboard Manager Pro**](http://clipboard.extensionbooster.com/), I ran into a bunch of funny, sad, and interesting things, so I thought I’d share them here.

# Motivation to build the extension

At first, I built this extension mainly because most other ones felt so “hard to use.” I’m a heavy Clipboard Manager user myself. I just wanted to build something that worked exactly how I liked — classic builder’s syndrome.

But then I wondered: why are other extensions so ugly and clunky, yet still have tons of users and even big paid plans? Turns out, they were *first movers*, that’s why.

# Releasing the MVP

The code was done, thanks to a lot of help from Claude (pretty reliable, kept me on pace). At first, I only planned to use Claude for coding the extension and server. But then I realized, “Wait, it even understands this better than me — why not have it make the landing page too?” Boom, landing page done.

The release was smooth: published on the store, posted in groups, did some seeding. Users started coming in — a few dozen. Good signal, I got hyped, added more features, and waited for the “magic” to happen.

# After the MVP release

But after 2–3 weeks, the launch effect faded. Posts disappeared, users in communities forgot. I kept adding new features, tried sharing in new ways, but only got a handful of new users.

So I went with “hard work makes up for smarts” — kept adding side features, redesigned the UI to be easier, added hotkeys… all just guessing what users wanted. Features piled up, users fluctuated. Not stable. I started feeling drained.

# Magic #1

That old intro post was still there, not deleted, not updated. Every day I checked analytics to see new users and churn: +2, +5, -2, -10.

Then one day, I checked new users — holy crap, an email ending in u/amazon. And they were using it *a lot*.

Wow. My crappy little extension, and even Amazon people noticed and trusted it? Maybe they installed by mistake? Fake email? Nope — verified. Their workload data kept increasing steadily, proving they were really using it.

That gave me energy again.

# Challenge #1

But joy never lasts forever. With a good signal, I tried posting to other groups/communities. As you know, making a clipboard extension with sync between devices immediately raises a “sensitive data” red flag.

People asked: *“Hey, if you sync across devices without sending data to a server, then how do you sync? Unless you invest in full end-to-end encryption, this is risky, right?”*

I had to explain, calm them down.

Another challenge: competitors noticed me growing and started running ads to crush me.

Instead of spending money on ads too, I decided to wait until they burned out their budgets. 😏

# Solving Challenge #1

Users are picky — like trying to please women 😅.

So I built **two modes**:

* **Online** → sync works normally.
* **Offline** → all data stays local, nothing is sent or stored except a login identifier.

That settled it.

# Magic #2

Another sunny morning, I was analyzing user data over coffee. I spotted some business emails. Wait — companies are using my extension too?

Filtering emails, I found whole groups of users from the same corporate domains. Turns out, not only do people use it individually, but they even recommend it to colleagues. Pretty fun to see.

Maybe I should think about some **B2B features** one day. Still brainstorming…

# Lessons learned

Turns out, no matter how big or small, simple or complex — tools always have users if they solve the right problem.

Problems always exist; the only way is to find solutions instead of avoiding them. Treat users well, and they’ll treat you well. Don’t fear criticism — people only complain because they care, and that feedback makes you smarter.

This rambling story has gone on long enough. Hopefully, **Clipboard Manager Pro** lives long enough to help people improve their productivity in small ways — and give me more stories to tell.

Thanks for reading this “no beginning, no end” story. See you in the next one.

And of course — the purpose of this post is also to “market” the main character 😅

1mzih7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mzih7c/aio_for_wanting_my_ex_to_move_out/,AIO for wanting my ex to move out?,"My (30M) ex (30F) and I are still living together and it is causing me a lot of discomfort in our home. We dated for about a year before her lease was up and we decided that she would move in with me. I spent months searching and found a great place at a pretty good price for our housing market and have spent the year+ living here making it a very nice space to live in. Admittedly, while dating, I ignored some major red flags including always hanging out at my house, where I would do all of the cooking and cleaning (I value my home time and do a lot of work from home so I like to keep a nice space). It was different when she was a ""guest"" and I minded a lot less being the one to treat her to a home-cooked meal and cleaning up afterwards. When we went to her place, she would either ask that I wait outside, or give her 5 minutes to ""tidy up"" before I came in. We'd really only hang out there after she ""had cleaned,"" but I'm now assuming that it was her roommates that had been doing the cleaning. She has a high-energy dog that never really gets walked or played with, so he is a little neurotic (barks at any noise outside, will chase shadows around the house, and run around the house barking and whining whenever a plane flies over-- which is frequently in my city). When she is out of the house, her dog will follow me from place to place and is obviously anxious when no one is home. I have two dogs that get long daily walks, more or less, and are a lot less dependent and a lot more chill. I can't manage walking 3 dogs at a time or otherwise would take hers with when I take mine.   
  
In the months before she moved in, I had multiple conversations with her about how when we lived together the chores, etc. would need to be divided and even had a few ""trial runs"" of her contributing more to the cooking and cleaning, doing more chores, etc. when she would stay over. It would go for a week or two, but then slowly regress into me doing everything. But she promised that when she moved in it would be better. On the last two days of her lease, she haphazardly moved her stuff into our house and it just sat in the common area (living room/dining room) for months before I had to organize a weekend for us to ""get the house back to normal"" by selling excess furniture or finding a place for it in our shed. I offered to sell my overlapping stuff (dressers, TV stands) but she said to keep mine because it was nicer. Living together really damaged our relationship. Like with the trial period before moving in, I would express that I needed more help keeping the house clean and it would improve for a week or two before going back to me doing all of the work. In the 6 months that we lived together while dating, I don't think that she ever cleaned a bathroom or wiped down kitchen counters and would instead do chores that she found less gross, like sweeping or taking out the trash, or emptying the clean dishwasher. When I brought up the subject she would say we needed to compromise on how clean the house was and that she was forgetful, so I should make her a chore chart if I wanted any help. This and general inconsiderateness like forgetting our anniversary, my birthday, etc. led me to end things with her. I was her first real long-term relationship and I really tried to end things compassionately, emphasizing that it wasn't the end of the world-- that she was still secure in the house until she found a new place, that we could take time to decouple things, and we could stay friends if that was her preference. Thankfully, it is a larger house and we both have separate bedrooms and bathrooms. 

After about 4 months of living together post-breakup, I had a mutual friend who was looking for a new lease and asked if I was looking for a roommate. I talked to my ex about her moving out, how it would give us both space, make things less awkward, and probably be better for our friendship generally. It would have worked out well, as I traveled for work over the summer and it would give her \~5 months to find a new place and offset the cost of rent until then, since our mutual friend would be paying for one of the rooms while I was away for 3 months. She said that she had no interest in moving and that because she was added the lease she was going to stay until it ended. So I moved away for the summer, taking my dogs with me. It was a great little escape.

While I was a away, however, she was worried that her dog was going to miss mine and without asking started fostering a dog from our local shelter. Part of the foster agreement is that you do the work to get the dog re-homed so that he (hopefully) does not need to return to the shelter. So now there are two dogs that don't get regular walks or enrichment. Also, I do not think that the house was cleaned a single time while I was away for the summer. I came back to clutter, cakes of dust, roaches, and food rotting in the fridge, on the counters, and in my rice cooker. She had also used a number of my things and left them out in the summer sun for the months that I was away. They're either cosmetically damaged (sun fading) or damaged (electronics). The weekend after I came back she was out of town and I just could not live like that and spent hours cleaning up the house and killing roaches (have not seen a single once since). When she got back I had a conversation with her about treating my things with respect and needing to keep the house cleaner now that we are sharing it again.

Also while I was away she started dating someone (38M), which I am genuinely happy for her about. I am really trying to check in with myself and reflect on if any of my emotions are coming from the little pangs of jealousy that come with first seeing any ex dating again, especially when sharing a space. I got the impression that they did not hang out much at our place while I was away because of how dirty the house was. But as soon as I came back and had cleaned the house, she started having him over more frequently without giving me any heads up. This led to very awkward first interactions, like walking outside to a random guy standing on my porch waiting for her, walking into my kitchen late at night in my pajamas (boxers and a t-shirt) to the same guy in my kitchen, or coming back home late at night from a 14-hour drive visiting family to his car in my parking spot and chilling in the living room right as I walked in. I had a conversation with her about giving each other a heads up about having people over so that we are at least aware of who is in our shared space. I tried really hard to emphasize that she didn't need permission or anything, but to shoot me a text so I can at least have pants on  when meeting people. I also mentioned that things would be a lot less awkward if she were to actually introduce us, since the ""uh... who are you?"" I got out in my kitchen wasn't as friendly as I would have tried to be under better circumstances. During the conversation, she suggested that we not have ""partners"" over after 10:30pm while the other might be coming home. I agreed and have previously made sure that anyone I have had stay the night was when she was out of town or knew she wouldn't be home. That conversation seems to have backfired, as it went from random, awkward encounters about once a week to now them hanging out here \~5 days a week at our place. The few times that they have stayed at his place, I get texts like ""hey we are coming over in 10 to make coffee and hang out,"" which is better than nothing but leaves me a bit miffed. I have a nice espresso machine (that we split the cost of nice coffee for), but there are plenty of cafes in the city that are closer and don't have the backdrop of your ex making breakfast in the kitchen. In the boyfriend's defense, he has made an effort to chat a bit when he's over and I genuinely appreciate that even if he (and the situation) are a little awkward. The heads up about company that the roommate had agreed to lasted about a week. Last night I came back home to them hanging out after the 10:30pm curfew that she had suggested without any notice.

When it is just the two of us hanging out things are really nice and amicable. We have a good friendship, but we do not live well together. It's a large part of why we broke up. Between being the only one regularly cleaning, dealing with 4 dogs (2 of which are rowdy and practically attached to my hip while I work from home), and the weird situation for both of us trying to date again I am really at the end of my rope. I have already asked her to move out when I had a replacement and she refused. Our mutual friend has since found a different living situation and it would be very financially straining to pay the full rent on my own even if she agreed to leave. I have seriously thought about finding another place for myself, but the current rent situation in my city would mean that a smaller place for just me and the dogs would be only marginally cheaper than paying for the whole place by myself. I have spent a lot of time making the space a nice place to be in and if I were to leave with all of my stuff it would be her, alone, in a large house with a mattress (no bedframe), her clothes, and a TV.  Any conversation that I have with her leads to a week's change at most and I am tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. AIO for wanting her to leave? Am I being unreasonable asking for more help with the house or a heads up about company? Am I missing anything obvious to improve the situation? Or should I cut my losses and spend the time and money to move to a less nice place that costs more? ",2,1756101145.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

(I know I need to just get better school and homework habits and im in the process of doing that i swear)

The only problem is I dont have any energy drinks and I ran out of coffee. Not sure if the caffeine from green tea will be enough to keep me going. Idk if this matters but I am a freshman in highschool also i volunteered today for 4 hours at a festival so im a bit tired. not sure if this makes anything better but im used to feeling tired since i have a history of being deficient in stuff and having poor health so sleepiness isnt that bad

You're in the middle of work or doing something fun, and you get the strange feeling you're being watched, only to turn and see maybe a mere glimpse of a shadow of something before it disappears into the deepest nooks of your cornea. 

Yeah, in my case there’s a man. Well, I can’t actually prove there’s a man, but I know he’s there, watching me from where I can’t see. It’s like I can sense him watching me. Like when I’m alone, I’m not really…alone. It all started maybe about a month ago. 

I work in a school as a night shift janitor, usually from 2pm to 12am. Not the best job in the world, but hey, someone’s gotta do it. It’s not a hard job; it’s basically what you’d expect: cleaning off desks, sweeping up dust, and mopping up any poor kid’s regurgitated lunch. Like I said, not the best job. Anyways, it wasn’t a particularly exciting night, to say the least. I just did what I normally did on every other day I had work. I’d usually get up around noon after sleeping in for so long because of all the gaming I did the night before. Then I’d make myself breakfast—well, I guess it would technically be lunch? Doesn’t matter, I’d make myself cereal and coffee regardless. After that I’d get dressed in my work clothes, which is usually something I wouldn’t mind getting dirty. 

After that it’s about a long and painstaking 40-minute drive to the high school. I won’t say the high school’s real name for the sake of privacy, but let’s just call it Hillcrest High School. Before I continue, let me describe to you what type of school Hillcrest is, so you know what I deal with every day. You see, Hillcrest isn’t one of those normal suburban schools you find lying off the side of some random highway in a populated area that has a grand football field behind it packed with life every Friday night. It’s an old, quiet, poor, rundown school that doesn’t even have a football field or a football team for that matter. And when I say old, I mean old as shit, like built in the 1850s and placed in the middle of nowhere by an idiotic politician in charge of education. And trust me, it shows. Wonder why it takes me so long to get to work? Because there is no main highway that leads to it, just a beaten-down gravel road that stretches on for miles. The outside? A foundation that consists of nothing but crumbling red bricks used to replace the molding lumber underneath, smothered in decaying concrete, resting in a large open field that spans 1 or 2 long grassy, weed-filled, and insect-infested miles. The inside? Hallways filled with scuffed yellow (used to be white) tiles and thin paper drywall walls that make up every room. The dim white lights that flicker from time to time (which means I’ll have to replace them soon) wrap up the whole vibe and give the school a nice eerie, unsettling feeling as soon as you step foot into the building. Only about 100 to 200 people attend Hillcrest because really that’s the max capacity the school has space for. It’s not big in the slightest, and I’m surprised it’s still open, but I’m not complaining; the fewer kids, the easier my job is. 

I’d arrived at Hillcrest High School at around 2:30 that day. I remember the time clearly because I kept cursing myself for being late. I hurriedly jumped out of my car and headed inside to clock myself in; I couldn’t really afford to be a second later. I was never the best at showing up on time, but today I showed up a lot later than normal. I don’t know what it was, but I just didn’t want to be there. As I reached the entrance to Hillcrest, I put my hands on the dead cold handle of the steel door in front of me, the metallic surface stealing every ounce of warmth in my body. 

Swinging open the door, a gust of even colder ventilated air hit my body, making every hair stand up on its tippy toes. I took a deep breath before walking down the crooked halls and into the break room that looked like it was held together with a couple of glue sticks and hope. A familiar ding sounded off as I used my punch card (I told you the school was old) to clock in. Since the school was so small, it was relatively easy for one person to manage by themselves, so there was only one daytime janitor and one night time janitor. At this point it should only be me in the building by myself…it should’ve been anyways. Now I don’t remember the exact way these events went down, so I’ll break it down the best I can. 

3pm. There are only 3 hallways in Hillcrest High School: one hallway for freshmen and sophomores, one hallway for juniors and seniors, and finally one hallway for elective classes, you know, stuff like band and choir. You get the gist. I would normally start with the freshman and sophomore hallway and kind of work my way around to the others after. First I’d wipe down all furniture in each classroom, then I’d go back around and dust mop all the rooms, then spot mop any mess that was left behind by the kids, before finally taking out all the trash and leaving for the night. Easy but definitely time-consuming. 

5pm. Almost finished with the freshman/sophomore hallway now. It took about 2 hours, but I finally did it. Unfortunately for me, the freshmen/sophomores today decided to be unusually messy, throwing anything they could find on the floors, which is why it took me so long to clean up. They don’t normally do that; you wouldn’t expect a freshman/sophomore in high school to act like a 5th grader, but sure enough it happens. Pencils, folders, books, and even things from the teachers' desks were thrown on the floor, like it was done specifically to spite me. It’s never THIS bad; I even know the teachers of this hallway, and they’re super friendly, even picking up students’ things off the floor before I even get to it to help me out. So why was it so bad today? I shrugged it off, trying to just ignore the strange occurrence, but in the back of my mind a feeling of unease started to make itself comfortable. Better get back to cleaning so I can finish on time. 

7pm. Almost done with the junior/senior hallway; nothing strange to report there. In fact, there was barely anything to clean up at all. So I guess the freshman/sophomore was really just messy after all? I was pretty disappointed in the disrespectful way the teachers let their kids trash their rooms today. I get it’s my job to clean up messes, but they shouldn’t intentionally leave one; it’s just so rude, you know? It pisses me off. Anyways, I only have one room left in the junior/senior hallway, but I’ll be sure to have a little chat with the teachers in the morning. 

7:24pm. The sun is starting to set on the horizon, disappearing with a yellow and orange glow. While taking out the trash of the last room in the junior/senior hallway, I suddenly heard a loud BANG coming from the other side of the school in the hallway where the electives are held. Now don’t get me wrong, this scared the absolute crap out of me and made my stomach drop about 6 feet below, but I wasn’t exactly surprised either. Being the old school that Hillcrest is, there are many cracks and crevices for animals of many kinds, like birds, rats, raccoons, and even cats, to try and sneak their way in and wreak havoc on anything they could find. I remember a particular time where the biggest animal I’ve ever found in the school, a large dog, was jumping around in a classroom tearing up colored paper while managing to flip over multiple desks. It took awhile for me to get him out and even longer to clean up the mess he made, but eventually I did. I took a deep sigh of annoyance, knowing that whatever animal got in this time, I would have to get out again and hopefully not contract rabies. I loosened my shoulders and hung my head as I slowly dragged myself to the final hallway of the night where the animal was. I truly don’t get paid enough for this. 

8:32pm. At this point it’s completely dark outside, and I’ve checked every single room in the elective hallway for any sign of animals without luck, except for the band room. As I stand outside looking at its large steel doors covered in colorful sheet paper spelling out “BAND” with a little down tuba on the side, I gulp nervously, bracing myself for any type of creature to be behind these doors. I reach out for the handle, twisting the knobs and opening the large steel doors that give out a drawn-out shriek due to their rusty hinges. I then flicked the light switch, waiting for the delayed lights to flicker on with the same white hue that every other classroom has. “Just 3 and a half more hours; just gotta make it to 12,” I said, taking slow, cautious steps into the band room. 

You see, the way the band room is set up is like this. It’s an extremely large room, probably the biggest in the entire school; it has grey cracking concrete floors and very tall, thin white walls that reach towards the sky covered in soundproofing barriers. Across the dirty concrete floor rest a bunch of black desk chairs for students to sit in, as well as black music sheet stands sitting right in front of them. The music room is so big it also has narrow, small carpeted stairs that lead up to a balcony with several small noise-canceling rooms in the back of it for students' private practices. The rooms upstairs are no bigger than a closet and can only really hold one student at a time, but with 3 of those types of rooms up there, multiple students are able to practice at once. Although it’s nothing special, it’s probably where most of the funding went when building the school. 

As I took steps deeper into the band room, I noticed a large beige filing cabinet that had been tipped over on its side and was now resting in the middle of the floor, knocking over several chairs and stands on its way down. Great, it must be a pretty big animal then. I walk over to it and try to lift the filing cabinet back up, pulling at it with all my strength as I let out several grunts of struggle. I then stop trying to lift it as a sudden shocking realization hits me. Wait a minute…there's no way an animal could knock this thing over, even if it was big. This thing weighs at least over 200 pounds; a HUMAN could barely move this thing. How the hell did it fall over? My eyes then quickly survey the surrounding area and manage to wander up to the balcony. What I saw next made my soul nearly leap to hell from how scared I was. 

I only saw it for a split second before it disappeared from my sight, but I swear I saw two large, thin, shadowy legs disappear around the corner of one of the doors of the small open rooms upstairs on the balcony. “Holy shit,” I’d said to myself, frozen in fear. Great, so there’s a squatter in the school, and he’s hiding upstairs. What should I do? Should I call the police? It’s the most logical option, but there’s no way they’ll make it here in time. At this time of night in the middle of nowhere? This guy will be gone by the time they’re even halfwayhere. Should I just run? No, I can’t; the school would definitely fire me for not doing my job and maintaining it at night. Great, more shit to handle, and by myself too. Although I didn’t want to, I somehow scraped enough courage into my soul to start to walk towards the upstairs. 

Every step I took made the wooden carpeted steps creak. One step, then another, creek, creek, creek, until finally I reached the top, facing 3 smaller steel doors, all completely pitch black on the inside. I take a look at my watch; it reads 

10:02pm. Ok, game plan here: kick the guy out, then finish the rest of my shift in peace, and let the school know about the incident in the morning. All I need to do is confront the man behind one of these doors, and hopefully he’ll leave without a fight. Just please, please be a harmless homeless person looking for shelter and not some deranged lunatic wanting to kill me. I’d decided to open up the first door on the left. As I place my now shaking hand on the knob of the first door, my whole body shudders. I’ll do it quickly, on 3. 1……2……3! I slam open the first door so hard it makes the walls shake. I quickly flip on the light switch, fully preparing myself to see someone there, but…there isn’t anyone there. Just a black chair and a music sheet stand, as there should be. Which means the man is in one of the other two doors. I shut off the light and closed the door of the first door while mentally bracing myself to open…. 

The second door. My heart was racing at this point; it’s a 50/50 shot that he’s either in this one or the other one over. I brace myself against trying to put on the most authoritative and intimidating face I can, preparing myself to yell my lungs out at some poor homeless fool that wandered his way inside. On 3, just like last time. 1……2…….3! I slam open the door and flip on the lights as fast as possible with a fierce look in my eyes, only to see…no one. Again, I’ve found no one, which means I now know which door this guy’s hiding behind. Part of me was glad that I haven’t been able to find anyone yet, because who really wants to come face-to-face with someone crazy enough to break into a school at 10 o’clock at night, but the other part of me was annoyed and fed up and wanted this guy out of here as soon as possible. 

You know what, screw it, it’s late, I’m getting this over with. I rush up to the final door on the right and bash into it with my fist. “HEY, WHOEVER IS IN THERE NEEDS TO GET OUT RIGHT NOW, OR I’M CALLING THE POLICE! ” I scream, trying to put on the most masculine voice I can. No response. Shit, I really am going to have to take this guy out by force. On three then. 1……………..2………..I stop hesitating for a moment, 3! I burst open the door, already swinging my fist around like a madman, not even bothering to turn the lights on. I then trip and fall over something before swiftly tasting the floor. I lay there for a moment in pain before jumping up and flipping the switch. Wait…no one? No…they can’t be; there was no one up here? But…no, I know what I saw; there has to be someone up here. Could it really be my imagination? 

I stood in front of the third door facing the inside with absolute confusion. Then I heard a cough. It was subtle and not very loud at all, but the room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, so it was pretty easy to figure out where the cough came from. Right behind me. I turn with the speed of lightning, so fast my eyes don’t even adjust, only to see no one. Seriously? No one? Am I going crazy? Insane? Or is the night shift finally catching up to me after all these years? Whatever it was, something strange was going on, and I was NOT going to be part of it. I quickly turned off the lights and made sure all three doors were shut, then rushed down the stairs as fast as I could without tripping. I then ran out of the band room, slamming the large metallic doors behind me. 

Wait, shit…. I completely forgot my cleaning supplies in there. Sure, I could just leave them, but without them I wouldn’t be able to finish cleaning the rest of the rooms. How am I going to explain why I didn’t finish my job to a bunch of angry teachers whose rooms weren’t clean? What? Say that I maybe saw something and was too scared to finish, and I would easily get fired on the spot. I decided against my best judgement to go back and at least retrieve my cleaning supplies, then in the morning explain to the band teacher what happened to the filing cabinet. As I headed back in, a gut-wrenching feeling hit me; every voice in my head screamed at me to turn around, but I continued regardless. As I turn the corner to face the large open band room once more, I notice all my cleaning supplies somehow neatly stacked on top of the filing cabinet lying in the center of the room. I speed walked over to it, trying to leave as soon as possible, but as soon as I went to pick everything up, I felt it. Someone was staring right at me, and then I noticed who it was. 

I dared not to turn my head toward it, but up on the balcony I could see it out of the corner of my eye. A large, thin, shadowy man with long, unnatural appendages and a twisted figure. The man was easily over 6 feet tall but hung his head low and to the side, just starting down at me. I couldn’t see every detail since I could only see him through my peripheral vision, so I couldn’t make out any facial features or human-like appearances, if he even had any. Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t human, but it was trying to be. I couldn’t move, frozen in fear of the thought that any second this creature…this oddly shaped man would sprint down to me and swallow me whole. I closed my eyes, praying that when I opened them it would disappear. That it really was in my head and I was just really tired. Whatever the case, real or not, I had to make a decision to move. On 3 I would open my eyes and look at that thing, then run to my car as fast as my legs would carry me. On 3 then…1, my heart began to race, its tantalizing rhythmic beat filling my eardrums. 2. I began to sweat drastically, pools of it forming at the base of my feet. Please don’t be real, please don’t be real, please don’t be real. 3! 

I opened my eyes and twisted my head towards that gong so quickly that I almost gave myself whiplash. As I opened my eyes in its direction, I then saw…nothing. I let out a nervous laugh of relief, just staring at the spot where the man once was. So I am just losing it after all. For moments I just stood there in disbelief that the man actually wasn’t there. Then I felt something on my shoulder, a hand; I could see it in the corner of my eye. Oh fuck, a hand is resting on my shoulder. A large hand, black as night, with different-sized fingers and long, sharp nails. The hand felt rugged and heavy, almost making me tip over. Fuck, fuck, fuck, this thing’s standing right behind me, and worst of all, it’s actually real. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? I need to run now; I need to run. I fried my head as my flight or fight instincts kicked in. Although as soon as I threw the punch, it connected with nothing but the air, because as soon as I turned my head all the way round, nothing was behind me. I couldn’t miss this chance; I ran straight out of the band room, forgetting all of my cleaning supplies. As I ran, I only looked straight back to make sure the man was chasing after me. I needed to get—WHAM—my head burst against the blue rusted lockers that sit on the other side of the hallway parallel to the band room doors. I fell to the floor with a large crash. As I held my head in pain, my instincts kicked back in again, and I got back up to run. 

I ran down the crooked hallways, my shoes squeaking across the scuffed tile floors. This time I kept my head straight forward to see where I was going, only looking back occasionally. I looked back expecting the man to chase me, but as soon as I looked back, nothing was there. I let out more crazed laughter as I sprinted towards the nearest exit. I look back again instinctively, barely turning my head over my shoulders. This time I wasn’t so lucky. Out of the corner of my eye there was the man, large, twisted, and terrifying, sprinting at me on all fours like some rabid animal. It let out an ear-piercing scream that was so high-pitched and loud it shattered the dusty trophy case I sprinted past, the glass flying out into the hall. I lost it, screaming in absolute fear and pissing myself. I ran as fast as I ever had. Warm teardrops fell down my face as I started to hyperventilate. Then I started to slow down. No, no, no, my stupid body had reached its limits. I guess that’s what not working out for years gets you. I then tripped up on my own feet and fell face first into the hard, cold tile floors. At this point I was so tired and out of breath I had just accepted my fate. I lie there waiting for the creature to devour me or do whatever it was going to. 

But it never did….. I had been lying there for multiple minutes, definitely enough time for the man to catch up to me, but he never attacked me. I got back up on my feet and turned around, and again there was no one. Again the man had seemingly disappeared out of thin air. Was he really real? No, he had to be; the glass from the trophy case was still shattered, lying out in the middle of the hallway floor. As I looked around frantically, I slowly took steps backwards towards the exit. Then I backed up right into a wall. Wait, a wall? In the middle of the hallway? There couldn’t be one; the exit was supposed to be right behind me. But there I was, my back to a wall. I reached my hand behind me without trying, feeling around the wall. It was stiff and rugged and warm and organic and…it wasn't a wall. It was the man. 

He was standing right behind me, and I had just backed straight up into him. As I stand there frozen, my hand still on the man, I could feel his warm breath brushing the hairs on the top of my head. He let out another ear-piercing screech, and I used both my hands to cover my ears as they started to slightly bleed. Some light bulbs shattered around us, making the atmosphere darker, as if it wasn’t scary enough. The man wasn’t attacking me; he was just standing behind me, almost as if he was taunting me. Like he was just out of my range of sight, and no matter how hard I tried to see him, I couldn’t. Like he wanted me to be in constant fear of him. I slowly lowered my arms to my side. 

The exit. The exit is right behind me, and the man is only about 30 feet away. All I have to do is make it to the exit. I gathered up the rest of the remaining strength I barely had and closed my eyes. Then I turned towards the exit and opened my eyes. Of course the man wasn’t in front of me anymore, but I could still feel his heavy breath and relentless gaze on the back of my head. I took each step carefully as to not make any sudden movements to invoke the man into attacking me. Every step I took, he took, like he was walking right on top of me. Slowly but surely I made it to the exit. 

I cautiously opened the metallic exit door and stepped outside; the cool night breeze brushed against my face. Then I sprinted as fast as I could to my car. I fumbled with the keys before finally unlocking my grey 2001 Kia Spectra. I hopped in, started the car, and hit the gas. My car’s tires made a screeching sound much like the man’s as I burst out of the school parking lot, leaving tire marks in my tracks. I had done it. I’ve successfully avoided the man and gotten away alive. I don’t know what he wanted from me, if anything at all, but I didn’t have to worry about that now. I’m calling in first thing tomorrow and quitting; I’ve had enough of this shit. 

The school lights that I had left on grew faint as I drove farther and farther away from it. The tension that had been overwhelming my soul had faded away, and relief washed over my body. I went to adjust my rearview mirror when something caught my eye. There in the corner of my eye, I had seen it. 

THE MAN, sitting in the back seat of my car. I screamed the loudest I’ve ever had before. The man screamed too, his scream shattering my windshield. I closed my eyes before hearing an even louder BOOM as everything went dark. 

The next thing I remembered from that night was the blinding lights of the hospital and the subtle beep of the vital monitor. Apparently I had crashed my 2001 Kia Spectra head-on into a tree. Thankfully I didn’t have any major injuries, just a few cuts and bad bruises. I was discharged about 2 days after the crash, doctors clearing my case as a mental breakdown. Soon after I got a call from the school, I was fired for vandalism and failing to do my job. I’d have to pay for any broken or damaged property too. I know I didn’t cause any of the damages; I know it was the man, but to be honest I was fine with that. I didn’t want to work there anymore anyways. I let out a large sigh of relief as the sun hit my face, spreading its golden rays across my skin. The nightmare is finally over. Or at least that’s what I thought. 

I thought the man was somehow connected to the school and that once I left, the man would disappear. But he didn’t. He was always there. I could feel his gaze, feel his breath, and sense his presence. Every time I went to brush my teeth and looked in the mirror, I’d see a glance of him. Every time I’d rinse my hair in the shower and had to close my eyes, I knew he was watching. Every time I would go to sleep, he’d be there in the corner of my eye at the end of my bed watching me. In my rearview mirror, in back of my car seat, behind me everywhere I went, IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE, he was there.  

I went to anyone who would listen. 3 therapist, 5 doctors, 2 psychologists, but everytime they would just come up with some excuse that I was crazy or schizophrenic or even just imagining the man.

I don’t know what the man is. I’m not sure if he’s a curse, I’m not sure if he’s a demon, and I’m really not sure why I’m the only one who can see him. But if there’s one thing I am sure of, I’m sure the man’s real. He has to be real. Because today was different. There was no man in the corner of my eye today, only one standing right in front of me, staring right back at me.",1,1756100943.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I wanted to add a crafting space for myself and my current setting does not have enough room for it. The crafting include but not limited to Lego set/Crochet/water painting (whatever I am interested). So initially I was thinking to have a new desk with shelf where the shelf can be used for storage&display. However my friend told me I can have the L-shaped desk as she will be moving and don't want it. the L-shaped desk is 75cm high and two arms are 175cm and 130cm in length, its black, modern style and has no storage area, and I came up with idea 2 ( I would need a shelf or draws for sure but idk where to put them yet...)

  
My issue is, I have hard time to make place cozy, the two design is more of ""how can I fit all of those furniture"", and I would like to have more cozy looking space. I would like some idea on how to place my furniture and what is the best working desk for me. 

  
1) Window side I have plants, they can not be moved as that's the only place I have some sun for my plants

2) Wanted to keep my sofa and coffee table

3) I don't have a TV and currently don't need one

4) My kitchen has a bar counter so don't need a dinning table

5) I have duel monitors for work purpose

It got me thinking: wouldn’t it be cool if Scott and Dave went on a buddy tour to university campuses (or anywhere else for that matter) to talk about this? Scott and Dave also align quite a bit on the problems facing college campuses. 

Scott comes from a left of center view (also as an atheist) and Ramsey is a Christian conservative. Their life and career journeys also mirror themselves in many ways too. 

It reminds of when Christopher Hitchens went on tour speaking and debating with Pastor Doug Wilson back in 2009 (those guys were even more polar opposites) but it really endeared each to the other side’s respective “side.”

Medical background:
	•	Blood pressure usually 130/80–150/80, with occasional spikes up to 170/90 (likely during periods of stress/anxiety).
	•	Diagnosed with mitral regurgitation.
	•	Not currently on medication. Cardiologist appointment is already booked.
	•	Health anxiety.

Current concerns:
	•	Episodes of pounding heartbeat, sometimes reaching 140–150 bpm, especially after eating or with caffeine/alcohol (both recently quit).
	•	Heart rate feels regular during these episodes, and can settle with deep breathing.
	•	About 10–20 PVCs per day (uncomfortable but not debilitating).
	•	Chest pain for the last couple of weeks: usually right-sided or center, not crushing, not radiating.
	•	No chest pain during exercise (weights, calisthenics, cycling).

Lifestyle:
	•	Used to drink coffee daily (1–2 espressos), now quit.
	•	Minimal alcohol, no smoking (previous social smoker).
	•	Diet improved recently; previously high in sodium and processed foods.
	•	Regular exercise without limitation or exertional symptoms.

Supplements:
	•	L-Citrulline Malate 2:1, about 2.5 g daily or every second day.

Additional notes:
	•	I’m a paramedic student, so I understand a BP difference of ~10 mmHg between arms can be normal, but ~20 mmHg might suggest LV hypertrophy or PAD
	•	Otherwise, I have no ongoing symptoms: no dizziness, no fatigue, no syncope. Dizziness only if I’ve been to the gym and had coffee.

Main question:
Could the combination of my anxiety, PVCs, and mitral regurgitation explain my symptoms, or do these features raise concern for something more serious (like structural or ischemic heart disease)?",1,1756100881.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I imagined quiet mornings with coffee and warm evenings reading a book outside. For the first few months, it was exactly that. Peaceful, private, and honestly the best part of my day.

But a few weeks ago, my upstairs neighbor decided to turn their balcony into what I can only describe as an extension of their kitchen. At first, I noticed the smell of fried food drifting down. I figured it was just once in a while, no big deal. Then it became almost daily, usually around dinner time. The smell is so strong that even with my sliding door shut, the scent clings to my curtains and sometimes even lingers in my living room.

The odd part is that I’ve never actually seen them cook with any large appliance outside, but I hear clattering pans and sizzling noises that don’t sound like a small portable grill. Last night, the smoke from whatever they were making actually drifted down and made my balcony unusable. I tried sitting out there with a fan on, but the air just felt greasy.

I’m stuck between not wanting to be the neighbor who complains and genuinely feeling like I can’t use the one feature I loved most about this apartment. I’ve considered knocking on their door to have a friendly conversation, but I also don’t want to start something awkward if it turns into a long-term conflict.

So now I’m wondering: is this just one of those things you accept in apartment living, or is it reasonable to bring it up with management if it continues? I don’t want to come off as picky, but I also don’t want my balcony turning into a deep fryer zone.",1,1756100114.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

He is also a surgeon so maybe someone could use that to attract more matches. But we met on Tinder last year in the spring. He didn't use his real name, but a random word. Let's say that random word was Night. 

So this account I found has the same few photos he had last year when we met but also 2 brand new that I know are knew because I took them 2 months ago. He has the same nickname Night. The profile is verified! (my friend said that its entirely possible to  verify a profile, then delete all pics and put fake ones of the person you have stolen them from. but still...). Some details are not the same as they were last year. But the hobbies he listed are the same, he is half French and the favourite song he put there (spotify connected) was a French song. He listens to French music a lot, but I don't remember this one. The age is hidden though. Which I know is a paid feature, to hide your age. 

I didn't find him in our city.  My cousin is on Tinder and went on vacation in Prague. She found his profile in Prague, near a hospital he visits occasionally.

Is there an chance it isn't him? I mean he is a good looking guy but nothing out of ordinary. If I would want to scam someone using a surgeon profile I would choose more professional pics. One of the pics there was a selfie (he has that selfie on facebook too though). But its the kind where in background one can see food, half empty coffee mug and its not a flattering pic.

I went to AA for many years before I got sober. Trying to get something to click. Unfortunately, both apply. I wanted to get sober, but wasn't on 100%, still had dreams of becoming a social drinker, and 2, I didn't take AA as serious as I should have. Regardless, I am sober now.

Anyways, I recently moved to a place in Southern Ontario, Canada. For some reason or another, I decided to check out a local AA meeting. It was Saturday night, I had no temptations, but I figured going to an AA meeting would benefit me more than anything.

I found one, it was in the basement of a church. I  met all the locals before the meeting, chatted, and then we proceeded with a ""proper"" AA meeting, preambles, anniversaries, things happening with the local group and announcements, and then we read a part from the big book.

Half way through the meeting one of the members scratched himself and needed a tissue or paper towel. I got up because I noticed some where they had the coffee pot earlier and went to grab the member some. Anyways, to my surprise, there was a 24 case of beer, with a few empty bottles in it and some missing, and the rest full.

Safety, let's talk about it. For me, in my state, it only offered disgust. And not for me, for the other members. Surely I don't need to say anymore, we all know how dangerous and irresponsible and questionable this is.

I  will not go back to this group, but  my question is, how do we address this? I know all groups take care of themselves, but this stains the name.

Edit: I  honestly didn't expect all these negative and snippy replies. I thought this was a group that looked out for one another and tried to help their fellow alcoholic. This is honestly, a reflection of how I feel about the meeting in question. 99% have already broken rule #1.",0,1756099691.0,alcoholicsanonymous,16,0.33,False

It's funnny, sometimes I sit in my favorite char, with a warm mug of coffee and just... breaghe. Lately, I've been feeling this profound sense of appreciation for these simple, peaceful moments. It's like the chaos of life kinda fades into the background. You know, all that hustle and bustle just doesn't seem as important when you take a second to just be.

There's something magic about the quiet, about the way it wraps you up like a soft blanket. I'm learning to cherish these instances where I can just listen to my own thoughts and not be bombardd by a thousand notifications or demmands. Maybe it's that I'm growing older, or mabye it's just the woorld we're in now, but these moments have beome pretty vital for my sanity.

So here I am, feeling really thankful and wanting to shaare it with someone I don't know. Doesn't that feel knida nice, the idea that we might all be finding little pockets of peace and gratitude no matter where we're at?

Take care, Stranger. I hope you find your quiet moments, too. 😊",9,1756099633.0,LettersToStrangers,0,1.0,False

1mzhw4q,https://youtu.be/p9ysJuLmPkQ,4 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Texas Road Trip Horror Stories,"# ""Nowhere to Run"":

My friend Anna and I had planned this trip for months. We wanted to escape the city noise in Houston and head south to the coast for some quiet time at a little beach rental in Galveston. It was just the two of us, no big group, no rush. We packed snacks, playlists, and drove off in my old sedan, laughing about work and old memories as the highway stretched out.

The drive started smooth. Anna fiddled with the radio, switching between stations until she found one playing old country tunes. ""This fits the vibe,"" she said, turning it up. ""Open road, no worries."" I nodded, gripping the wheel, watching the flat land roll by. Billboards for gas stations and fast food dotted the sides, but as we got farther from the city, things thinned out. Fewer cars, more empty spaces. We talked about stopping for food soon.

About halfway, the engine made a weird sputtering sound. I glanced at the dash— the gas gauge looked fine, but something felt off. ""Pull over?"" Anna asked, her voice casual but with a hint of concern. I eased onto the shoulder, a narrow strip beside the interstate. Tall grass waved on one side, and beyond that, open fields that seemed to go on forever. No houses in sight, just distant oil rigs like silent guards.

We popped the hood, but neither of us knew much about cars. Anna pulled out her phone. ""No signal,"" she muttered, holding it up. Mine was the same—dead bars. ""Great. We're in the middle of nowhere."" She tried to laugh it off, but I saw her glance around. The road was quiet now, only the occasional truck rumbling past without slowing.

We waited maybe twenty minutes, hoping someone would stop. Then a pickup truck appeared in the distance, slowing as it approached. It pulled up behind us, and a man got out. He looked middle-aged, wearing worn jeans and a faded shirt, his face rough from sun or hard living. ""Need help?"" he called, walking over.

""Yeah, the car just died,"" I said, trying to sound calm. Anna stood close to me.

He peered under the hood. ""Looks like the alternator or something. I can give you a tow to the next exit. Got a shop there.""

We exchanged looks. Anna whispered, ""What do you think?"" I shrugged. Options were slim. ""Okay, thanks,"" I told him.

He hooked up a chain from his truck to my bumper. ""Hop in my cab. Safer that way."" His tone was flat, no smile. We climbed in, Anna in the middle, me by the door. The cab smelled like old cigarettes and something metallic. Tools rattled in the back as he started driving, towing my car behind.

""Where you headed?"" he asked after a bit.

""Galveston,"" Anna said. ""Just a quick trip.""

He nodded slowly. ""Nice area. Quiet. Lots of space out here."" He kept his eyes on the road, but I noticed how he gripped the wheel tight.

The exit he mentioned didn't come. We passed a sign for League City, but he kept going, turning off onto a smaller road that led away from the highway. ""Shortcut,"" he explained when I asked. The pavement turned to dirt, bumping us around. Fields spread out on both sides, empty and wild.

""This doesn't feel right,"" Anna whispered to me, her hand on my arm.

The man glanced over. ""Problem?""

""No,"" I said quickly. But doubt crept in. Why take us this way? No shops in sight, just endless grass and patches of woods.

He pulled over suddenly, near a cluster of trees. ""Let me check the chain."" He got out, and we sat there, tense. Anna reached for her phone again—no signal still. ""We should get out,"" she said softly.

Before we could, he came back to the window. ""Chain's loose. Come help hold it while I fix."" His voice had an edge now.

I hesitated. ""We can wait here.""

""Need an extra hand,"" he insisted, staring.

Anna opened her door first. ""Fine, let's just get this done."" I followed, my legs shaky. We walked to the back, where my car sat hitched. He bent down, tinkering, then stood up fast, holding a wrench like a weapon. His face changed—no more helpful stranger. ""Get in the field,"" he said, low and mean.

""What?"" Anna backed up.

He lunged at her, grabbing her arm. She screamed, pulling away, but he swung the wrench, hitting her shoulder. She fell, crying out. I grabbed a rock from the ground and threw it at him, hitting his side. He turned to me, eyes wild. ""Run!"" Anna yelled, scrambling up.

I bolted into the tall grass, hearing him chase. Branches scratched my face, mud sucked at my shoes. Anna's footsteps pounded behind me, then a thud—she tripped. I looked back; he was on her, dragging her by the hair toward the trees. ""Help!"" she gasped.

I froze for a second, then ran at him, kicking his leg hard. He stumbled, letting go. Anna got up, and we both sprinted deeper into the field. He followed, cursing, but slower now. We hid behind a thick bush, breathing hard, listening. His footsteps crunched closer, then stopped. ""Come out,"" he called. ""I know you're here.""

We stayed still, minutes dragging. My mind raced—stories I'd heard about this stretch of road, girls vanishing, bodies found later in places like this. Was this one of those killers? The thought made me shake.

Anna whispered, ""We have to move."" We crept low, toward what looked like lights far off. He must have heard; footsteps started again. We ran, weaving through the grass. He caught up to Anna, tackling her. She fought, scratching his face. ""Get off!"" she shouted.

I picked up a branch and swung it at his head. It connected with a crack. He groaned, rolling off. ""Run, Anna!"" We dashed away, him staggering behind.

We reached a ditch, jumped it, and kept going until we hit a fence. Beyond was another road, a car passing. We climbed over, waving wildly. The car stopped—a woman inside. ""Please help!"" I yelled. ""He's after us!""

She let us in, locking doors. ""What's wrong?"" As we sped away, I looked back—he stood at the fence, watching, then turned back to the field.

At the police station, we told everything. They searched, found my car abandoned, but no sign of him or his truck. Days later, they mentioned similar cases—girls picked up on that highway, never seen again, bodies dumped in fields. One officer said, ""You're lucky. Most don't make it out.""

Anna and I don't talk much now. The fear lingers, especially at night. I drive different routes, avoid empty roads. But I wonder about the others, the ones who didn't escape. What happened to them out there in those fields?





# ""The Border Road"":

I had just crossed into Texas from Mexico, heading north on a backroad near Laredo to avoid the crowded highways. My old pickup truck was loaded with camping gear for a solo off-grid trip through the brush country. I planned to camp in the remote spots along the Rio Grande, fish a little, and clear my head after a rough year at work. The sun was dipping low, turning the flat land orange, when my engine started coughing. I pulled over on a dirt track off Highway 83, miles from any town. No signal on my phone. Just scrub brush and silence all around.

I popped the hood and stared at the mess of wires and hoses, not knowing much about fixes. After a few minutes of poking around, I heard tires crunching on gravel. A white SUV with green stripes pulled up behind me – Border Patrol. The driver stepped out, a tall man in uniform, badge shining. He looked about forty, clean-shaven, with a serious face.

""Having trouble?"" he asked, walking over slow.

""Yeah, engine died. No idea why,"" I said, wiping sweat from my forehead.

He nodded and looked under the hood. ""Let me see. Name's David. I patrol these roads all day. Seen a lot of breakdowns out here.""

""I'm Alex,"" I replied. ""Thanks for stopping. I'm on a road trip, trying to stay off the main paths.""

He fiddled with a few things, then straightened up. ""Might be the fuel pump. Hard to say without tools. Nearest garage is back in Laredo, but it's getting dark. You got anyone coming?""

""No, phone's dead out here."" I felt a bit uneasy, but he seemed official, helpful even.

David glanced around, like he was checking for something. ""These backroads can be dangerous. People go missing sometimes. Coyotes, smugglers, you name it. Hop in my truck. I can give you a ride to town, call a tow from there.""

I hesitated. My truck had all my stuff, but leaving it alone felt risky too. ""Appreciate it, but maybe I can wait it out.""

He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""Suit yourself. But last week, a guy like you broke down nearby. Never made it home. Folks found his car empty.""

That made me pause. ""What happened to him?""

David leaned against my truck. ""Who knows? This border area's full of bad types. Women mostly, but men too. They vanish quick."" He paused, staring at me hard. ""You armed?""

""Just a knife in the glove box,"" I said, trying to sound casual.

He chuckled low. ""Knife won't do much against what's out here at night."" He walked back to his SUV and grabbed a flashlight, shining it around the brush. ""Tell you what, I'll stay a bit, see if we can jump it or something.""

We talked while he worked. He asked about my trip, where I was from – Austin, I told him. He shared stories about his job, catching crossers, the long hours. But something felt off. His questions got personal: Was I traveling alone? Did anyone know my route? I answered vague, but my gut twisted.

After twenty minutes, he slammed the hood. ""No luck. Come on, get in. I'll drive you.""

By now, the light was almost gone. No other cars had passed. I grabbed my backpack and knife, locked the truck, and climbed into his passenger seat. The SUV smelled like bleach, sharp and clean. We drove slow down the dirt road.

""You ever hear about the killings around here?"" David asked after a quiet stretch.

""No, what killings?""

""Women found shot, dumped on roads like this. Four in the last couple weeks. Police think it's random.""

I shifted in my seat. ""That's awful. You think it's safe?""

He glanced over, eyes narrow. ""For most. But out here, alone... easy to disappear.""

The road got bumpier, heading away from the highway instead of toward it. ""Isn't town the other way?"" I asked.

""Shortcut,"" he said flat. ""Trust me.""

I didn't. My hand slipped to my pocket where the knife was. He noticed. ""Nervous?""

""Just tired,"" I lied.

He pulled over sudden, in a dark patch of mesquite. ""Need to check something."" He got out, walked around back. I heard him open the trunk. My mind raced – why stop here? I quietly opened the door, slipped out, and ducked into the brush.

""Alex?"" he called, voice calm but edged. ""Where'd you go?""

I crouched low, heart racing, thorns scraping my arms. I saw him with a flashlight, sweeping the area. In his other hand, a gun glinted.

""Come out. It's not safe.""

I stayed still, barely breathing. He searched for minutes, cursing soft. Then he got back in the SUV and drove off slow, lights scanning.

I waited an hour in the dark, shaking, before hiking back to the highway. Flagged down a trucker who called the cops. Turns out, David was Juan David Ortiz, a Border Patrol supervisor. He'd killed four women that month, picking them up, shooting them execution-style on rural roads. I was lucky – the fifth potential victim who got away.





# ""The Killing Fields"":

Jake and I had been arguing a lot lately, mostly about small things like work stress and not spending enough time together. One weekend, we figured a quick getaway might fix that. We packed light, just some clothes and snacks, and jumped in his old pickup truck. The plan was simple: drive south from Houston, stick to the quieter roads, maybe find a spot by the coast to relax. No big itinerary, just us and the open highway.

We left early, cruising down I-45 at first, but Jake wanted to avoid the traffic. ""Let's take the back ways,"" he said. ""See the real Texas, you know? Farms, fields, that kind of thing."" I agreed. It sounded peaceful. We turned off onto smaller roads, the kind with long stretches of nothing but grass and occasional oil pumps bobbing up and down. The radio played country songs, and for a while, it felt good. We talked about our future, laughed about old memories.

About an hour in, the truck started making a weird noise, like a rattle under the hood. Jake pulled over to check. We were in the middle of nowhere, no houses in sight, just flat land and a ditch running alongside the road. He popped the hood, tinkered around, but couldn't figure it out. ""Must be the belt or something,"" he muttered. ""We'll need a tow."" My phone had no bars, and his was the same. We waited, hoping someone would drive by.

Time dragged on. A few cars passed, but none stopped. Then, after maybe half an hour, we heard the low rumble of a big rig approaching. It slowed down, pulled up behind us. The driver hopped out, a tall guy in his forties, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. He had a mustache, looked like any regular trucker. ""Having trouble?"" he called out, walking over.

""Yeah,"" Jake said, wiping his hands. ""Engine's acting up. No signal out here either.""

The man nodded, glanced under the hood. ""Looks like your alternator might be shot. I can give you a lift to the next town, League City ain't far. Got a CB in the cab, can call for a tow from there.""

I looked at Jake, and he shrugged. ""Sounds good, man. Thanks.""

""I'm Bill,"" the trucker said, shaking Jake's hand. He glanced at me, smiled politely. ""Hop in. Cab's big enough for three.""

We grabbed our bags and climbed up. The inside was clean, but something felt off right away. There were little things: a faint smell, like old sweat mixed with something metallic. Tools scattered on the floor, chains and hooks hanging from the wall behind the seats. Bill noticed me looking. ""For securing loads,"" he explained. ""You never know what you'll pick up on the road.""

We started driving. Bill chatted easily at first. ""What brings you two out this way?"" he asked.

""Just a little trip,"" I said. ""Getting away from the city.""

He nodded. ""Smart. City's full of noise. Out here, it's quiet. Real quiet."" He asked about our jobs, where we were from. Jake told him we lived in Houston, and Bill said he passed through there a lot. ""Pick up hauls all over. Been driving these roads for years.""

As we went, the conversation shifted. Bill started talking about hitchhikers. ""See a lot of 'em,"" he said. ""Young folks, runaways mostly. They think the road's freedom, but it's dangerous. You hear stories.""

""What kind of stories?"" Jake asked, trying to keep it light.

Bill's eyes flicked to the rearview. ""Girls gone missing. Bodies turning up in fields. You know about that stretch along I-45? They call it the Killing Fields. Over thirty women dumped there since the seventies. Unsolved, most of 'em.""

I shifted in my seat. ""That's awful.""

""Yeah,"" Bill said, his voice dropping. ""Some say it's one guy, others think more. Truckers see things, you know? Lonely spots, easy to hide.""

Jake tried to change the subject. ""So, how long till League City?""

""Not long,"" Bill replied. But he didn't speed up. Instead, he turned off the main road onto a narrower path, gravel crunching under the tires. ""Shortcut,"" he explained. ""Saves time.""

The landscape got emptier. No lights, no signs. My stomach tightened. ""This doesn't look right,"" I whispered to Jake.

Bill heard. ""Relax. I know these roads like my own hand."" He chuckled, but it didn't sound friendly.

We drove in silence for a bit. Then Bill started again. ""Ever wonder why people disappear? Sometimes they just want to start over. Other times... well, someone makes 'em."" He glanced at me, his eyes lingering too long.

Jake tensed. ""Hey, man, maybe pull over. We can walk from here.""

Bill ignored him. ""Nah, we're almost there."" But we weren't. The truck slowed near a patch of overgrown field, the kind with tall grass and abandoned oil rigs in the distance.

I grabbed Jake's arm. ""Something's wrong.""

Bill stopped the truck, turned off the engine. ""End of the line,"" he said quietly.

Jake reached for the door, but Bill moved fast, pulling a handgun from under the seat. ""Don't,"" he warned. ""We can do this easy or hard.""

My mind raced. This couldn't be happening. ""What do you want?"" I asked, voice shaking.

Bill smiled, cold now. ""Company. It's lonely out here."" He told us to get out, pointed the gun. We did, hands up. The field was dark, isolated. No one around for miles.

He marched us toward the grass. ""Been doing this a while,"" he said, like it was casual talk. ""Pick up strays, have some fun. Then... gone. Like those girls in the fields.""

Jake lunged at him, grabbing for the gun. They fought, rolling on the ground. I froze for a second, then ran to the truck, searching for something—anything. I found a wrench on the floor, heavy and cold.

Behind me, a shot rang out. Jake yelled in pain, clutching his leg. Bill stood over him, gun aimed.

I swung the wrench as hard as I could, hitting Bill in the back of the head. He stumbled, dropped the gun. I hit him again, and he went down.

""Jake!"" I screamed, running to him. Blood soaked his pants, but he was alive. ""Come on, we have to go.""

I helped him up, got him to the truck. Bill groaned on the ground, starting to move. I jumped in the driver's seat, keys still there. The engine roared to life, and I floored it, gravel flying.

We made it to a gas station, called the cops. They came quick, took Jake to the hospital. Turned out Bill was wanted—real name Robert, a trucker with a history. They'd found photos in his rig, evidence linking him to missing girls from Texas. Regina, a teen from Pasadena, one of them. Her picture, taken before he killed her, haunted me.

Jake recovered, but we never took another road trip. Those fields, those roads—they hide monsters. And sometimes, you barely escape.





# ""Lost on Calder Road"":

I always loved the idea of getting lost on purpose. Alex and I had been together for two years, and we needed a break from the city noise in Dallas. We packed our old SUV with snacks, a tent, and a map that promised hidden spots off the main highways. ""Let's skip the interstates,"" I said one morning over coffee. ""Find some real Texas, the quiet parts."" He grinned and agreed, his hand squeezing mine. We headed south toward the Gulf, planning to camp in rural areas where stars filled the sky and no one bothered you.

The first day went fine. We drove through flat lands dotted with oil pumps and small towns where folks waved from porches. By afternoon, we were on I-45, the long stretch between Houston and Galveston. Signs warned of construction, so we took a detour onto a smaller road, Calder Road, according to the map. It wound through League City, a place I'd never heard of, with houses giving way to empty fields and thick woods. The pavement turned rough, then gravel. ""This is off-grid alright,"" Alex joked, turning down the radio. Our phones lost signal soon after.

We stopped at a gas station on the edge of town, an old building with flickering lights and a single pump. The clerk, a thin man with a faded tattoo on his arm, filled our tank while staring at the horizon. ""You two heading far?"" he asked, his voice low and flat.

""Just exploring,"" I replied, handing him cash. ""Any good camping spots around?""

He paused, wiping his hands on a rag. ""Fields out there are quiet. But stick to the road. People go missing sometimes."" His eyes met mine for a second too long. Alex laughed it off as local flavor, but I felt uneasy as we drove away.

The sun dipped low, turning the sky orange. We found a pull-off near a wooded area, a spot that looked perfect for our tent. No one around, just tall grass swaying and distant refineries glowing like distant fires. We set up camp quickly, built a small fire, and shared sandwiches. ""Hear that?"" Alex said after a while. Crickets chirped, but something else rustled in the brush, like footsteps circling. ""Probably deer,"" he muttered, but he added more wood to the fire.

Night fell hard. We climbed into the tent, zipping it tight. I lay awake, listening. The rustling came again, closer. Then a low whistle, almost human. Alex sat up. ""What was that?"" We waited, hearts pounding. It stopped. He grabbed the flashlight and unzipped the door a crack. The beam swept the field—nothing. But in the distance, headlights flashed on the road, then vanished.

Morning brought relief. We packed up, ready to move on. But the SUV wouldn't start. The engine clicked uselessly. ""Battery?"" I suggested. Alex popped the hood, tinkering. No luck. We were miles from anywhere, no signal. ""We'll flag someone down,"" he said. The road was empty, though. Hours passed. A truck finally appeared, slowing as it approached. An older man in overalls stepped out, his face weathered and expressionless.

""Need help?"" he called, walking over. His truck was rusty, tools scattered in the bed.

""Yeah, won't start,"" Alex explained. ""Mind giving us a jump?""

The man nodded slowly. ""Happens out here. Fields eat cars sometimes."" He hooked up cables from his battery. While waiting, he leaned against his truck. ""You folks from up north?""

""Dallas,"" I said. ""Just passing through.""

He glanced at the woods. ""Pretty girls like you shouldn't wander alone. Lots of stories 'round here."" His tone was casual, but his eyes lingered on me.

""What kind of stories?"" Alex asked, trying to sound light.

""Missing ones. Women, mostly. Found in fields like this."" He pointed to the tall grass beyond our camp. ""Dogs dig 'em up sometimes. Skulls and such."" I swallowed hard. The engine roared to life then. ""There you go,"" he said. ""Follow me to town if you want. Safer.""

We thanked him and pulled out behind his truck. But something felt wrong. He drove slow, too slow, glancing back in his mirror. The road narrowed, veering away from the main path into denser woods. ""Where's he going?"" I whispered. Alex frowned. ""Maybe a shortcut.""

The man's brake lights flashed. He stopped ahead, got out, and waved us over. ""Problem?"" Alex yelled through the window.

""Road's bad up here. Come see."" He stood by the edge, peering into the brush.

Alex hesitated, then turned off the engine. ""Stay here,"" he told me. I locked the doors as he walked up. The man pointed at something in the grass, talking low. Alex leaned in, then stiffened. I couldn't hear, but his face changed—pale, eyes wide. He backed away, shaking his head.

""Get in the car!"" Alex shouted, running back. The man followed, slow at first, then faster. ""What's wrong?"" I yelled, unlocking his door.

""Just drive!"" Alex jumped in. I hit the gas, tires spinning on gravel. In the rearview, the man stood watching, a strange smile on his face.

""What happened?"" I demanded as we sped away.

""He showed me bones. In the grass. Said they were from 'the last ones who got stuck.' Like it was funny."" My hands shook on the wheel. We didn't stop until we hit a real town, Webster, with lights and people. At a diner, we asked about the area. The waitress leaned in. ""Calder Road? That's the Killing Fields. Bodies turn up there. Women, vanished off the highway. Cops think it's one guy, maybe more. Never caught.""

We reported it to the police—a sketchy encounter, the bones. They took notes, said they'd check, but their faces said it all: happens too often. No follow-up came. We ditched the off-grid plan, stuck to interstates home.

That night haunts me. The rustling, the whistle, the man's eyes. What if we hadn't started the car? What if we'd followed him deeper? Texas hides dark places, and we brushed one. I don't drive rural roads anymore. The quiet isn't peaceful—it's waiting.",1,1756099003.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to understand what’s the easiest way these days to build a full-stack application (backend + frontend) with the potential to launch on iOS—something along the lines of a Notion-like app.
For context: I used to be a Rails developer from 2011–2016, working mostly with Rails 4 and Backbone on the frontend. I didn’t enjoy writing JavaScript at the time, so I leaned on CoffeeScript. Since then, I’ve been working in product management and I miss writing Ruby, so I’m getting back into coding.
Right now, I’m brushing up on Rails and Ruby using Pragmatic Studio, but I’d love guidance on:

(1) What modern tech stack I should use for the frontend alongside Rails, with the least friction (based on my background).
(2) Good resources to help me get back up to speed and build a full-stack app.

He caught my eye a while ago because he’s got some really neat tattoos and we have a similar music taste. A few days ago he started hanging around my counter and talking with me, it wasn’t for a long time but it’s what made this go from thinking “wow he’s pretty” to “holy fuck I can’t stop thinking about him” . He’s really sweet and I like him a lot, the only problem is that I’m still in my teens and he’s almost definitely above the age of 25. It’s definitely a passing thing but I genuinely can’t stop thinking about this guy. Like, I only took a 10 minute (out of a half hour paid) break because I wanted to be the one to get his coffee incase he came in (he did). And I know I don’t want to peruse anything with this guy even if he was interested bc as it is *technically* legal, I don’t want to be with an adult who’s interested in dating someone that’s under 20.

1mzhq7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mzhq7f/angel_falls_by_kristin_hannah/,Angel Falls By Kristin Hannah,"Okay, folks, I just finished reading **Angel Falls By Kristin Hannah**, and wow, what a journey it was! If you're looking for a book that will make you think and feel, you might want to check out [Angel Falls By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/angel-falls-by-kristin-hannah/). Kristin Hannah is known for her deeply emotional stories, and this one is certainly no exception. I wanted to share my honest thoughts about it, as if we were just chatting over coffee about our latest reads.

This book tells the story of Dr. Liam Campbell, whose beloved wife, Mikaela, mysteriously falls into a coma after a tragic accident. The doctors have little hope, but Liam, a neurosurgeon himself, refuses to give up. As he desperately tries to find some way to wake her, he starts delving into her past, uncovering secrets about Mikaela, and even their life together, that make him question everything he thought he knew. It's a gripping tale about memory, unconditional love, and the complex lines we draw between past and present. No spoilers, of course, but it truly pulls you into its mystery from the very first page!

What I truly loved about *Angel Falls* was how incredibly well Kristin Hannah crafts her characters. Liam's desperation felt so real, and you genuinely rooted for him to find answers and bring Mikaela back. Mikaela, even in her comatose state, becomes a fascinating character through the vivid flashbacks and the discoveries Liam makes about her. The emotional depth here is powerful; you really feel Liam’s grief, his hope, and his growing confusion as he uncovers hidden truths. Hannah has a way of making you care deeply about what happens to these people. Her writing style is simple enough to flow smoothly, but rich enough to paint vivid pictures and evoke strong feelings without being overly dramatic. The pacing was excellent for the most part, slowly revealing clues that kept me turning pages late into the night. It genuinely felt like solving a deeply personal puzzle alongside Liam, piece by piece.

If there was anything I found myself contemplating, it was that sometimes the emotional intensity could feel almost overwhelming. Not in a bad way, mind you, but it’s definitely a book that asks you to invest fully in its characters’ pain and struggles. There were a few moments where a character's actions might feel a little frustrating, but in hindsight, it perfectly fit their journey and the complex human nature Hannah was exploring. It's not a light read; it tackles heavy themes, so be prepared for that emotional dive.

So, would I recommend *Angel Falls*? Absolutely, yes! If you enjoy psychological dramas, stories about family secrets, and incredibly moving explorations of love, loss, and memory, this book is definitely for you. It's a fantastic read for anyone who appreciates a deep, character-driven story that stays with you long after you've finished the last page. You can easily find it and start reading [Angel Falls By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/angel-falls-by-kristin-hannah/).

For my new reader friends out there, or anyone looking to dive into more books, here are a few simple tips that have helped me:

1.  **Don't Feel Obligated to Finish:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it's perfectly okay to put it down. There are millions of amazing stories out there; find one that truly sparks your interest!
2.  **Read at Your Own Pace:** There’s no rush or competition to finish a book quickly. Enjoy the journey, whether it takes a few days or a few weeks. Reading should always be a pleasure, not a chore.
3.  **Explore Different Genres:** Don't stick to just one type of book. You might be surprised by what you enjoy! This book, for example, is a psychological drama, but many people love thrillers, historical fiction, or even fantasy. Broadening your horizons can lead to wonderful discoveries.
4.  **Join a Community:** Talking about books makes reading even more fun! Find a local book club, or join online communities like this one on Reddit. It’s a great way to discover new titles, share your thoughts, and connect with other book lovers.

Reading is an amazing adventure, and every book opens a new door to different worlds and ideas. Don't be afraid to try something new, and remember that every expert reader started exactly where you are now. The most important thing is to simply enjoy the story.

If you're ready to get lost in a compelling narrative that will tug at your heartstrings and keep you guessing, I highly recommend picking up [Angel Falls By Kristin Hannah](https://pdfhive.com/angel-falls-by-kristin-hannah/). Happy reading, everyone!",1,1756098437.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

I can vent to her and get the advice to “ignore it” or stay positive but when it’s her, she does the exact opposite. I am 32… why am I still constantly seeking her approval anyways? My relationship is so toxic with her, it’s best when we can “bond” over basically gossip. She drinks way too much wine each night, and always has. She has always been a functioning alcoholic, and I have always felt responsible for her happiness. I broke away from that 6 years ago when I moved out of state.

I was way too involved in her and my dad’s divorce, and the triangulation and enmeshment in our family of 4 was so bad looking back.  She has always treated me like a friend and confided in me in ways that you would with a girlfriend over coffee. 

I can’t vent or bring up something  from the past without her making a comment about how she somehow had it worse or was also struggling, basically anything to somehow make her involved. She is so materialistic but tells me I buy too much for my kids. She doesn’t make me feel good or seen or loved. Then why, WHY, am I still always seeking her approval or hoping “this time will be different” with needing her?! When I go to her for help, she isn’t there for me.

Being a parent and parenting differently than I was parented is mentally one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. It’s exhausting in a new way. It’s so confusing to think of my memories of my mom that make me nostalgic, while at the same time remembering how NOT to act towards my 5 year old daughter because I remember those moments too.

I know this is all over the place and might not make sense, but I needed to get it out.

I was up early, enjoying a fresh cup of coffee. My wife was asleep upstairs after working a long night shift. It was her day off, so I decided to work from home and let her rest. Not wanting to wake her, I brought my gear downstairs to the basement to set up for my podcast, The Afterthought Lounge.

While prepping, I skimmed through yesterday’s audio logs. That’s when I saw it—an unfamiliar voice memo.

Only two minutes long.

Timestamp? 2:30 AM.
I didn’t remember recording anything at that time. My last saved file ended around 9:30 PM.

Curious, I threw on my headphones and hit play.

Nothing.

Just a full minute of silence.

I figured it was an accidental recording—maybe background noise or mic interference—but something about it itched at the back of my skull. A weird pressure. I hit play again.

That’s when I heard the voice.

My voice.

Faint, glitching under heavy static. I ran it through my editing software—noise reduction, volume boost—and replayed it.

What I heard chilled me:

⸻

“Listen to me. The life you’re living isn’t real.
You don’t have a wife. You never did.
You need to wake up. Before it’s too late—”

(bitter, shaky laugh)
“She’s coming. I don’t even know why I still call it she.
That thing wearing her skin? It’s watching. Learning.
It doesn’t bleed. It doesn’t blink.
But it knows your habits. Your tells. Your guilt.”

(gunshots. a scream. something slams hard—like bone hitting concrete.)

“It lets you feel safe long enough to forget.
You’ve done this before. Don’t you feel it?
The patterns? The same words. The same coffee. The same lie?”

(panic rising)
“You think this is the first time we’ve had this conversation?”
“You don’t remember because it wants you to forget.
It feeds off the forgetting.”

(deeper static. heavy breathing.)

“Whatever you do—don’t go upstairs when it calls your name.
Don’t look at it. Don’t answer. Don’t believe its face.
It’s not real.”

(sobbing now—shaky, desperate)
“Please… just get out. You can still escape.
Don’t let it touch you. Don’t let it speak your name—
It doesn’t kill you.
It keeps you.”

(wet gurgling. dragging sounds. one final voice—yours—screaming through tears:)
“I think I loved it once. Or maybe… it loved wearing her.”

(A sharp snap. Metal bending. Something wet drags away.)

(Then: silence. Sticky. Heavy. As if blood soaked the tape itself.)

⸻

I ripped the headphones off. My heart was pounding. Was it a prank? Some messed-up audio experiment I forgot I ran?

And then—
I heard my name.
From upstairs.

Soft. Familiar. Too familiar.

“Hey…? Where’d you go?”

Then again—closer.

“Babe?”

I stood frozen. My blood felt wrong in my veins.
If that wasn’t my wife… then what the hell was it?

I turned toward the basement window. My hands fumbled with the lock. I had to get out. I was about to open it when—

“There you are, silly. I was wondering where you were.”

She stood at the top of the stairs, smiling sweetly. But her voice—it had no weight. Like it was mimicking something human.

She walked down slowly.

“What are you doing by the window?”

I forced a calm smile.

“Just… getting some air.”

I turned back to the glass.

And that’s when I saw it.

Her reflection.

It wasn’t human.

Distorted. Twisted. A grotesque mockery of her face—like it was learning what people should look like and almost got it right.

Then I felt it.

A hand gripped mine. Cold. Wrong.

“Let’s not do that, okay?”
Her voice was right behind me.

And then—

Everything went dark.

⸻

I woke up this morning.

Coffee. Birds. Quiet.

She’s still asleep upstairs.

And I’m just here, sipping coffee like nothing ever happened.

But something did happen.

I checked my laptop. The voice memo is gone.

But I swear…

I hear faint static in my headphones.

And sometimes, just barely—

I think I hear myself calling.

He has such an ""I didn't sign up for this shit"" attitude, he's fumbling his way through the plot, and it's beautiful.  
The ""kid brother (adult)"" dynamic is sweet yet hilarious.

I didn't think it could get better than that scene where he ends up in Bryce's bed instead of Hunt, but then we get chapter 18.  
He plays warrior swinging around his ""big sister's"" cool sword and gets so into it (with a sunball-like announcer, even) that he jumps up on the coffee table in triumph. Right as Bryce walks in. And he crushes the table and discovers the plot.  
I was in hysterics.  
That scene was right on par with Syrinx biting Hunt's ass right before Bryce opened the shades. And also Hunt tailing Bryce into traffic and almost getting sideswiped by a car.  
\* chef's kiss \*

And then he makes some of my favorite contributions to what I now consider to be the best sex scene in an SJM book:  
(not him, but still amazing)  
""Your chest is as big as mine."" - Bryce  
""That's the least sexy thing anyone has ever said to me."" -Hunt  
\---  
""Please: have sex a little louder! I didn't hear everything that time!"" -Ithan (shouting from the other room)  
\---  
""I'm going to fuck you senseless."" -Hunt (to Bryce)  
""That sounds medically dangerous."" -Ithan (still shouting)

And then of course there's the follow-up, in which Hunt dreams of the Prince of the Pit and his first conclusion is that Bryce blew him so good that his mind shattered and he's seeing Hel.  
I can't even begin to decide what to make of this, but it's hilarious.

In conclusion, Ithan is wonderful.  
(And Hunt needs to have his head checked)

====

On to the complaints.

I feel bad for Emile, but I'm not actually mad that the rebels want to use his powers to their advantage. I find it hard to apply real world morals regarding child soldiers to a fantasy setting where humans are a powerless, severely oppressed class and most Vanir are either apathetic or antagonistic toward their plight. If the Vanir were to turn on the Asteri en masse, *then* I would be more critical of the occasional terrorism and/or child soldiers. But while their forces are mostly magicless and fighting ""gods,"" they get a pass on ruthlessness.

I am so tired of SJM's fixation on ""training."" That said, I appreciate Apollion's offer to send ""appetizers,"" and I hope that's how it actually plays out. It sounds fun.  
At the very least, I better not get any training montages or lectures about ""lactic acid.""

A bit of a tangent, but the code names (Silverbow, Daybright) sound like elf names, which has me thinking that SJM should have just called the Fae elves instead. Fae have specific lore around them that she's barely even acknowledged, which was a huge letdown.

**😂📖 TLDR:** 2/4 picks hit, 2/4 props hit, app dropping next week!

\--

Good evening, friends! Tonight’s write-up is powered by my trusty *extra-large* coffee cup ☕️. I've decided to start posting my full ""Post-Game Recap (+ Nightcap)"" to Reddit for those who like the deep dive into how my betting day went! Get cozy, I’ve got a few things to run through.

Today was a fairly even one for me — **Picks finished 2/4, and Player Props also landed 2/4.** The silver lining? Every single prop was plus money, so those of you who tailed likely ended up hovering around even. Here’s how it shook out:

**Picks (2/4)**

* BOS Red Sox v NY Yankees Over 8.5 (-115) ✅
* BAL Orioles ML (-130) ✅
* BAL Orioles Team Total Over 4.5 (-110) ❌
* WAS Nationals v PHI Phillies Over 9.0 (-120) ❌

**Props (2/4)**

* TOR Blue Jays v MIA Marlins: Kevin Gausman Over 5.5 Ks (+120) ✅
* HOU Astros v BAL Orioles: Gunnar Henderson Over 1.5 TBs (+110) ✅
* KC Royals v DET Tigers: Kerry Carpenter Over 1.5 TBs (+105) ❌
* HOU Astros v BAL Orioles: Colton Cowser Over 1.5 TBs (+145) ❌

I’ve gotta admit… I’m still choked that *Pick of the Day* didn’t cash. Why do these normally abysmal pitchers suddenly wake up and decide to pitch like Cy Young when we’re fading them? 😂 Ah well — tomorrow’s a new day.

On a brighter note: the **Belle’s Picks App** is officially dropping just in time for NFL season! 🏈🤩 I can’t wait to share it with you all. By downloading the app, you'll receive push notifications to your device whenever new picks, props & parlays post! I've also put a few other fun things in there as well 😉 I’ll have the App Store link for you late next week.

Alright everyone, that’s it from me tonight. Rest up — tomorrow, we go again!

1mzhc2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1mzhc2i/voyagers_fundamental_flaw/,Voyagers' fundamental flaw...,"I actually like Voyager. But there's no denying it pales in comparison to some of the other series, and I think I know why.

It's no secret that Voyager struggled until they decided to focus more on the two breakout stars, Seven of Nine and the Doctor. Part of the problem is that Voyager is more episodic than probably any Star Trek since TOS.

But that's not the real issue. The real issue is that Voyager doesn't do much to build up the backstory of its characters. Contrast Voyager to TNG, another show that was highly episodic.

While TNG also avoided many continuing plot arcs, the main characters felt much more fleshed out. We have:

Data - Mysterious origins, the only one of his kind, found in the ruins of a colony attack.

Worf - Orphaned and raised by humans, father accused of treason, secret brother, past lover who gives him a secret son.

Picard - Artificial heart from his reckless youth, conflicted relationship with his brother and his father, rich family history, his continued interest in archeology, the Maxia incident that led to Daimon Bok's feud with him.

Unsurprisingly, these are the breakout characters of TNG, probably the ones people remember the most.

Now, look at Voyager. Most of the crew members don't really give us much to work with beyond their job descriptions.

Tom Paris is the disgraced Starfleet officer seeking redemption, but to be honest, that plotline lasts like a day. He settles in really quickly as a pretty reliable character. They mixed it up a little bit with his fake-out rebellion in S2, but for the most part, he's just the pilot. His backstory rarely impinges on the present.

What is Harry Kim other than a somewhat passable clarinet player? He has no backstory other than that he had a girlfriend. He actually has so little backstory that at one point the writers toyed with the idea of making him secretly an alien from the Delta Quadrant all along.

Chakotay gets lip service to his Native American heritage, but it often feels superficial rather than genuinely explored. He ends up being a doormat and the guy who lacks any clear sense of self. (Seriously, I didn't want to go there about him ""going native,"" but this is the main plot of so many of his episodes. He falls in with any group that he's known for more than a few days and immediately adopts their culture. He's like a chameleon. The Krenim, the Voth scientist, breakaway Borg faction, etc. It's one of the reasons that episode about him being brainwashed into becoming a soldier worked, because I genuinely thought he was just identifying too much with their culture.)

Janeway herself is just a woman who had a fiancé, likes coffee, and has a dog named Mollie. For seven years, we get nothing much about her previous life or really any hobbies that aren't fleeting. Even her friendship with Tuvok, while endearing, isn't fleshed out much. How did they meet? Why is he so loyal to her?

It's not that the crew of Voyager don't get character development. It's that their characters mostly boil down to what they're doing on Voyager, what their jobs are, what their hobbies are, if they get one, and no, I'm not counting the sporadic references to Clarinet that we never really see you play, Harry.

When you strip it down, Voyager only has a few dynamic characters: Seven of Nine, the Doctor, Tuvok, and B'Elanna in the earlier seasons.

Tuvok's backstory is really fascinating, but we don't see as much of it as I'd like.

B'Elanna is an interesting character because she's clearly very conflicted with herself about her heritage, and we get some really good character development in the first few seasons. Then, she settles down with Tom, and that conflict mostly disappears. I actually didn't mind that. I thought it was good for her character to find what she's been looking for. It just didn't provide much grist for stories after she became more domestic.

That leaves the Doctor and Seven of Nine. Little girl kidnapped by the Borg with issues surrounding her parents and sentient hologram struggling with identity pretty much write themselves. We even got a bit of backstory for the Doctor through the Zimmerman episodes.

It's no wonder the writers decided to focus on those two so much.

One thing I'd add: Voyager's premise - being stranded far from home - actually should have made character backstories more important, not less. When you can't easily bring in guest characters from someone's past or return to familiar locations, the backstories become your primary source of dramatic material. DS9, running concurrently, showed how you could mine character histories extensively even in a relatively confined setting.

What are your thoughts?

Instead, I spent the last few years becoming specialized in copying information from one tab to another.

It wasn't a sudden change. A new customer comes in, you handle it. A new client signs up, you onboard them and send mail manually one by one. At first, it's manageable. But as the business grew, It became the repetitive and It consumes my important time that I can use in some productive tasks.

My breaking point was a Sunday night. I was on my third coffee, manually sending the same ""just checking in!"" email for the tenth time, and I thought, **""This is insane. I started a business to be free, not to be a digital slave.**

I knew I needed to automate my tasks But I don't know how to code and I didn't have the budget to hire an assistant just for this So, I tried some popular automation tools Like Zapier and n8n, but they felt like building a Complex machine — they are so difficult for a simple task. I needed something that is simple and easy to use.

I started using with some of the new AI tools that can understand simple prompt and interact with your other software or tools. It Take some time but I’ll find one that worked best for me:

**Emails →** Now my automation send email automatically when a client signs up, Now I don't have to worry about If I send the email or not.

**Payments →** It checks, if payments cleared and stored them for me.

**Reminders →** Before I have to send reminders to client to send their details but Now It send a gentle reminder automatically if client don't send the details on time.

Just these three things gave me back my important time and it saves about 10 hours a week. More importantly, Now I can focus on important tasks of my business. I don’t wake up thinking “ugh, I forgot to send that email.”

**The lesson I learned is this:** Your time is the most valuable asset you have. If you're spending it on repetitive manual tasks, you're being a digital slave, not a founder. Automating these stuff isn't about being lazy; it's about being smart with your focus. you don’t need to automate everything at once. Even automating 2–3 repetitive tasks that save you time and reduce stress. Start small.",1,1756096960.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1mzh9b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mzh9b1/give_him_a_blowjob_every_day/,Give him a blowjob every day,"I get one every day. Okay, so almost every day. Probably about 300 days out of the year, and that is how I wake up. Even then, there will be days where I get 2-3 blowjobs, and she always gives me one after sex. And she has never spit my semen. She always swallows my load....always. I've never spoken to anyone about it, but I may be the luckiest man alive. 

A little background: It wasn't always like this! We've been married for 20+ years. High school sweethearts. I am 43, she is 40. We have 3 kids and a relatively loving home. I am a very involved and loving father. We have been through alot, but no infidelity issues. Our sex life has had its ups and downs, especially through postpartum depression and other life issues. But I've been good to her. And it really paid off.... Because sometime around 2020, my wife decided to start every single day by sucking me off. One day it just started, and never ended. Let me explain. 

It isn't always just head. Sometimes we have sex instead, but I'm getting the follow-up blowjob with that too. And if I don't want a blowjob (very rare) she acts like she is mad. I don't know if she read something about the benefits of semen; but it has changed our lives. It's not quite every day: There are a few days per year where we are arguing; or not getting along, or she is tired. Plus we all get sick sometimes. Those days are skipped, but she will make up for it!  Otherwise, I just have to simply exist, and her lips will make their way around my penis every 12 to 24 hours, without fail. Even more when she is on her period. I recently counted and I got 18 blowjobs in 7 days. And I don't push her.....she initiates almost all of them. I don't have to ask. 

As far as the details, she doesn't deepthroat me or anything, and she is petite with a very small mouth. She does that tandem ""hand and mouth"" motion, with a fast cadence that could wake the dead. When she sucks me, you can tell that she loves her man, and she wants me to feel good. She is like a semen extraction machine. Then she'll snuggle up next to me and lay her head on my chest. What a feeling that is! And there is no rushing to the sink. Sometimes she will fall asleep right after I finish. She simply loves my flavor. On occasion she will keep going after I cum the first time. That shit makes me grip the sheets, folks. It's pure agony for about a minute, until I am ready again. That junk will make you fall in love all over again. Sometimes, I'm still shaking in my vehicle on the way to work. And all it makes me want to do is treat her better. 

All married women listen up. I know this is not for everyone. But there have been zero cons to this, as far as my relationship goes. It has helped me as a person. I have more patience. And when she yells or gets overstimulated, I respond with more stability and understanding. I used to be more emotional and insecure. Not only am I calmer, but I am happier and more in love with her than ever before. If she's having a rough time, I easily stay present for her and have patience with her. It's not that I didn't before, I'm just more aware now, because this woman starts her day by pleasing ME. How could I not improve myself? And I'm not a simp, I still lead our family and provide a secure household. The reciprocation is natural: I have always given her respect, quality time, good dick, back rubs, sweet treats, coffee, flowers, dates, vacations, long conversations, and just overall companionship. And I still fuck her well, about 2-3 times per week, and I absolutely, 100% make sure she gets off FIRST, and multiple times if possible. It definitely won't work for every couple, but it has worked for me. I don't expect it to last forever, but I will be forever grateful for the years of pleasure.

It was a beautiful relationship and I never felt so loved, accepted and appreciated until I met him. The breakup sent me into a spiral of grief and we did try to mend it a bit later, with no success and went no contact until early this year. I never went no-contact, but he did. Until January. I never stopped loving and missing him, for many reasons I shall not name. I thanked God when he did reach out again. We've been in contact since, with the once or twice a month of us meeting and, obviously, still sleeping with each other.

Recently he has admitted to me, after denying for so many months, that he did still love me. 

Early last year, I was diagnosed with PCOS. A condition that left me with an 80% chance of never having my own children. I was okay with it to start with, as I never wanted kids of my own. However, as time went on, it started to tear me down as I realized only very recently that I did in fact, wanted kids at some point and even opened up to my best friend (M25) who is gay, that I could never go through an abortion as I knew I'd regret it later down the line. I knew that the chances of me having my own were slim and I didn't want to minimize the chance even more. Who would've thought though - I was already with child as on Thursday (21st August 2025), my guts told me to take a pregnancy test. My breasts felt tender, my ovaries hurt (which is normally quite normal with my condition) and my period was late, which I was also used to with PCOS. But I couldn't ignore my guts. I went to a store, bought two tests, went home and immediately used both tests. In the meantime, I went to make myself a coffee, some food and washed the dishes. I came back into the bathroom, only to find myself screaming around the flat once I saw that indeed - I am pregnant. 

I panicked. Since knowing him, I knew he never wanted children either. However, with seeing both tests positive, it only even more confirmed that indeed I was ready to welcome a child into this world. I am starting to call my Mother and my two best friends. No one picked up. So I called a best friend of mine and S (my ex), who immediately picked up. I showed him the picture of both positive pregnancy tests and he was over the moon, and for all the right reasons, worried with and for me. After our discussion, I managed to talk to my other two best friends and my mother and all were also happy and again, worried over how he would react. 

I knew I needed the whole day to process it. I was in shock, I was in denial, I knew he's a busy guy and I felt like it was best to tell him the next day. So I did. And his reaction was far from nice or supportive.

Since knowing him, he never once raised his tone at me, he never said mean things to me - he was just this super chilled out guy.

Indirectly I'm being told to get rid of it.
""You drink and you smoke"" - I am not an alcoholic and don't drink to get drunk. When I get tipsy, I turn to water or coca cola. I've already quit smoking weed. Cigarettes will be next. 

""You're not in a financial place to have this child, nor am I, this pregnancy will cause you complications, our careers will be over, we're not even back together"", and so on. Throughout the conversation, I felt belittled. Judged. Even worse. But I don't want to make things longer. 

It was once I said I wanted to keep the pregnancy that he went crazy. What hurt the most is that he accused me of betrayal, simply because I realized that I wanted a child. But even when I told him that it wasn't the case, he brushed whatever I said off. It was painful being accused of it. He's betrayed me many of times, but he didn't even focus on what he did to me in the past and I didn't want to waste another breath to go into the details of what he did to betray me. I simply hung up on him as I will not have a stressful pregnancy. 

I will keep it, even if it means I will have to raise it myself. I just hope he will get his head around it. I don't NEED him, but I'd like him to be there. In the meantime, I will focus on me and what's best for the pregnancy. I will also give him that space and allow him to reach back out whenever he is ready to do so.

I’ve been seeing this question *a lot*: *“Is it better to study in the morning or at night?”*

The truth is… science says it depends on **your brain, your body and your habits**. Let me break it down with some research, sprinkle in my own data from **Michiko StudyHub**, and show you how to figure it out for yourself.

# 🔬 What Science Says About Focus + Timing

The whole “morning vs night studying” debate isn’t really about discipline — it’s about biology. Specifically, something called your **chronotype**. That’s just science-speak for whether your body naturally runs on a “morning person” or “night owl” rhythm. It’s controlled by your circadian rhythm, the 24-hour cycle that affects alertness, hormones and brain activity.

Researchers usually figure out someone’s chronotype by looking at their **sleep-wake cycles**: what time they naturally fall asleep, wake up and when they feel most alert. You can self-check this by noticing things like: *Do you feel groggy and useless before 10am no matter how much sleep you get? Or do you start fading by 9pm while everyone else is wide awake?* That’s chronotype at work.

Here’s where it gets interesting:

* **Morning-types (“larks”)** – A systematic review by [Chauhan et al. (2025)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-12074-001) looked at how chronotype and time of day affect thinking skills. They found that people often performed better on attention, memory, and reasoning tasks at their *optimal time of day* — for example, morning types did better earlier in the day. 
* **Evening-types (“owls”)** – The same study showed night owls showed sharper performance later. Their brains weren’t “lazy” — they were just wired to peak later.
* To double-check this, another study by [Schmidt et al. (2007)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5781075_A_time_to_think_Circadian_rhythms_in_human_cognition) investigated circadian influences on cognitive performance and brain activity, using neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI to observe how brain activation patterns correspond with individual chronotypes and the time of day. They found that night owls’ brains lit up with activity in the evening, while morning types lit up in the morning. So the preference isn’t just psychological — it’s baked into your neural activation patterns.

🌓 **What About Everyone Else?**

Not everyone is an extreme lark or owl. Many people fall into the **“intermediate” chronotype** (sometimes called “third birds”). These students tend to have more flexible study peaks, often around **early afternoon**.

📖 **Study insight**: [Roenneberg et al. (2003)](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/14504057/2003JBiolRhythmsRoenneberg1.pdf) surveyed over 25,000 people and found chronotype distributions fall along a bell curve. Only a minority are “extreme” larks or owls; most people sit in the middle.

👉 **What this means:** there’s no single *“golden study time”* that works for everyone. Your biology pushes you toward your own peak. If you fight it (say, a night owl forcing 6am study sessions), you’re basically working *against* your brain’s wiring.

# 🧪 How Do You Know Your Chronotype? (and Why Guessing Doesn’t Work)

* **Questionnaires**: The most validated is the [Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire](https://sleepsurge.com/morningness-eveningness-questionnaire#:~:text=The%20Morningness%20Eveningness%20Questionnaire%20below%20is%20a%20popular,below%20and%20press%20calculate%20to%20receive%20your%20result) **(MEQ)**, which asks about sleep habits, alertness, and preferred times.
* **Behavioral Clues**: When you naturally feel alert without coffee or an alarm clock.
* **Tracking tools**: This is where **Michiko’s** **StudyHub analytics** come in. By logging your study minutes across the day, you can literally *see* your patterns.

You can read 50 articles about whether to study at sunrise or midnight, but the *only real way* to know is to:

1. **Record your study sessions** (minutes, focus, how you felt).
2. **Look at patterns** over weeks, not days.
3. **Adjust accordingly.**

That’s why I’ve been relying on StudyHub’s analytics — it literally graphs out *my chronotype in action*. Even if two people are both “night owls,” their *exact* peak times (say, 8 PM vs. 11 PM) can differ hugely.

# 📊 My Example (using Michiko StudyHub)

This is where tools like Studyhub become game changers. You can track *your own* study sessions, see when you’re most focused, and compare across weeks/months.

For example, my **Time of Day Activity bar graph** showed:

* **2 PM → 1006 minutes studied (all-time)**
* **5 PM → 854 minutes studied (all-time)**

[Time of Day Activity \(using Michiko StudyHub\)](https://preview.redd.it/8aucd9cb3sjf1.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=84827e46937171e727f71e0914edf4951527fa75)

And my **Peak Performance Hours** analysis literally told me:

* **3 PM to 5 PM → 10% more productive than my average**

[My peak performance \(using Michiko StudyHub\)](https://preview.redd.it/w1gpbp8h2sjf1.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c47de1117cfa26b1c388b5d68a3ee8a338ed479)

What does this mean? For me, it suggests **I’m not truly a “morning” person** — I get more done in the mid-afternoon. So now I *plan my heaviest, most focus-intensive study tasks between 2–5 PM*. Lighter review or creative brainstorming, I leave for evenings.

# 🎭 Different Study Styles, Different Best Times

Your study style also influences when you should ideally study. Michiko has a cool system with mascots that represent **different learning styles**, and I think they actually map well to time-of-day preferences:

* 📜 **Sovarius (Analytical Thinker)** → Best in **mornings** when working memory is fresh and distraction is low.
* 🎇 **Luminara (Visual Dreamer)** → Often thrive in **afternoons/evenings**, when the brain’s creativity peaks.
* 🎶 **Virellis (Auditory Scholar)** → Late morning or evening, since discussions and rhythmic repetition benefit from mental “alert zones.”
* 🦊 **Aurelix (Adventurous Explorer)** → Any time, but do best **switching environments** — a morning field study or late-night deep dive.
* 📚 **Archivus (Enduring Scholar)** → Consistency > time of day. They should stick to a set schedule daily.
* 🐺 **Valtorius (Strategic Mastermind)** → Likely benefit from *tracking data first*, then optimizing based on peak performance windows (like my 3–5 PM).

The important bit: **these aren’t fixed rules**. Even if two people are both Sovarius types, their chronotypes can make one peak in the morning and the other late at night.

Being a vampire sucks. It used to suck blood but now it just plain sucks.

Back in the day if any other vampire heard me blurt out such a statement, they would have thought me mad. These days there might be many that feel much the same way as I do, even if they might not state it as bluntly.

When I was first turned, it was all about hunting, stalking, flying and of course, sucking; specifically the sucking of human blood. For chaos was us, fear our fuel and blood our greed. Now, although, it’s skulking in dark corners, making broody expressions and updating our Goth wardrobes.

To further elaborate why I harbor such a negative opinion of the current state of vampirism, I would have to start at the beginning.

A long time ago, I used to live in a village called Borca in Wallachia. It was a small unassuming, sleepy village about 30 kilometers down south from Dracula’s castle. I herded sheep. Not even my own sheep. Someone else’s sheep, for the least amount of coin one could possibly obtain. Yes, life sucked then too.

Then one fine night, one damn sheep wandered off into one creepy forest and I was tasked with bringing it back. Of course, I didn’t, as the sheep was found lifeless and drained of its blood. Moments later, in those last horrifying moments, so was I.

Here began my journey into the world of darkness. The year was 1475 and I arose, craving blood. Also, I can’t recall what month it was but I’m pretty sure it’s not that important.

On the night of my rising, I was in the presence of a rather regal looking woman. Pale, beautiful and with skin that glistened in the moon light. At the sight of her I’d thought my heart skipped a beat, but actually it was the fact that my heart wasn’t beating at all, being undead and all. Not that it changed anything; I still thought I was looking at the finest vampire maiden one could encounter.

She introduced herself as Katarina, a high vampire loyal to the ranks of Dracula. That’s right, the Dracula. She had personally arranged an introduction. At that time Dracula had lost a fair share of vampire servants and Katarina was out on a turning and recruiting spree.

The next couple of years were a fantastic blood fest of horrors. Villages near and far, towns all around and even fortified cities weren’t safe from the carnage we would bring.

Unfortunately though, it wasn’t long after, that news reached our ears of Dracula’s demise. I still don’t believe it. I recon he went into hiding, biding his time. Others think he is keeping a watchful eye from some unholy abode. Needless to say I hadn’t seen him since.

Katarina swears I missed the height of his power. She often liked to tell me tales of Dracula. The story of how he struck down a Danesti lord in the blink of an eye, numerous impalement stories, stories of his battles, stories of his vampire lieutenants, stories of his hunting down of individuals of select ethnic groups, which I thought was a little racist. All epic stories none the less.

Now, everything is different. Today I live in a hotel apartment called ‘Villa Haunt Studios’ in the town of Rasnov. It belongs to a financier turned vampire who is a friend of mine.

He had recently redesigned the basement turning it into a hotel café for tourists and guests that stay here. We call it the ‘Café of Eternal Darkness’.

Tourists love it. I don’t.

Our menu list is bloody Marys, black coffee of the night, espresso of damnation, Batty for tea, the Transylvania fog, impaled donuts and stake steaks.

 I’d been convinced to become a barista. In this era keeping a low profile was important for a vampire. Still, serving food and drink to a rambling herd of human cattle was not what I had in mind.

Keep getting asked if I want a ‘smal’ or ‘large’ flat white - when I seem confused they tell me a small only has one shot of coffee. 

I thought the whole concept of the flat white was that it has two shots of coffee as opposed to a latte which is more of a coffee flavoured milk drink rather then a coffee with milk like the flat white.  

So you now have to pay extra to get a ‘large’ size with two shots which is what the flat white actually is. It would be like ordering a cocktail with a set ratio of ingredients and being asked if you want ‘small’ or ‘large’.
