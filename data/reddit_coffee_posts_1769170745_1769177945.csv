1qkrz8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/dicegames/comments/1qkrz8z/from_bottom_to_top_my_free_solo_dice_game/,From Bottom To Top - my free solo dice game,"Hello dice enthusiasts! I have written a small solo dice game for the [48-word RPG jam](https://itch.io/jam/48wordrpgjam). It is called [From Bottom To Top](https://ka1ikasan.itch.io/from-bottom-to-top) and it is a (kinda) simulationist game about mountain climbing.

My game uses a set of six polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20) which are rolled to generate climbing ""holds"". You choose one and reroll others. The one you choose next mostly depends on whether you want to play safe or to take some risks, to optimize your current situation on to bet on a long term success. The higher you climb, the more challenging it becomes. Of course, there's a lot of luck involved and you might scream ""I was *that* close!"" quite a few times in a session.

It's not a difficult game by any means but there are some decision making that can make your session incredibly long or, on the contrary, help you in the long run. There are some obvious strategies that may help but they are maybe not as obvious for people who do not play with dice a lot or for some young folks. But above all, this game was created because I like rolling those nice and shiny polyhedral pebbles while my coffee brews in the kitchen.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

1qkrxo4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkrxo4,I'm 99% sure these listing photos are AI due to the unrealistic mannequins and the nonexistent laws of physics being applied,"To preface - I saw these listings on Depop, but since then I found these images are actually all taken from other sites e.g. Shein and just random no name brands lol

I'm pretty sure that this is AI at this point, but everyone who comes on here is always so sure only to be proven wrong LOL  - would appreciate your thoughts (and also appreciate if you guys could find these pics and report them too if AI). I think it's AI generated because:

* first pic the sweater shoulder area doesn't hang on anything and is suspended -  thought it must be some metal frame but doesn't look like mannequin has that without it (could be some removable frame but I doubt it)
* The items fit the mannequin too perfectly, and ngl buyers wouldn't be able to tell especially if the fabric is stretchy lol- [shein listing with 5 stars and 100+ reviews ](https://us.shein.com/Soleia-Women-s-Striped-Knit-Off-The-Shoulder-Wrist-Length-Sleeve-Top-In-Coffee-Brown-With-Unique-Hem-Unique-Tops-For-Women-Off-Shoulder-Sweater-p-228704557.html?mallCode=1&pageListType=4&imgRatio=3-4&detailBusinessFrom=0-1_228704557%7C0-2&pageListType=4)
* Last 2 pics...LOL, the fit is crazy and the mannequin is insane
* Last pic arms just hanging at a 45 degree angle , looks like no frame in sight so should be impossible

POINTS FOR NOT AI if u can call it that:

* Mannequin neck strain lines look the same so you could say  the mannequin was consistent
* Background semi consistent with lines on right hand side and wallpaper bloom effect on left

The reason this shocked me so much is that I didn't expect to come across AI organically (outside of pinterest) while I was literally shopping for clothes in such a blatant way. If this isn't AI somehow Im gonna be so glad",1,1769177739.0,isthisAI,1,1.0,False

last week friday i ended up remembering and taking my meds,i was fine on friday.

then comes saturday half way through the day i was at coffee with a friend and i started feeling a panic attack coming on it lasted for a bit but then when it was time to go home i felt completely fine came home went to sleep like normal.

then fast forward a few days,i have been so unbearably anxious every single seconds of the day the heart palpitations and shaking are unbearable and i can barley sleep at night,the worst anxiety ive ever felt in my life.

i contacted my doctor on tuesday they said stop taking the medication (cold turkey btw) obviously i wasn’t happy with this but i carried on not taking it cold turkey anyway.

fast forward to today (friday) ,i could not sleep at all my anxiety is unbearable,i feel so cold,im shaking and i feel hopeless.

i just need some advice do i start taking my medication again or not and if i should start taking it shall i take halves or the full 10mg?

These friends treat me kindly, just as they do their other female friends, so I’ve never felt concerned about our interactions.

In the past, I’ve noticed that some people who expressed romantic interest in me were already married or in a relationship, which has made me even more confused about my situation.

I’m currently in graduate school, and I’ve met two men whom I became friends with because they seem like genuinely nice people. However, I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking things, but they often ask me out for coffee or for academic-related discussions—something they don’t do with our other friends in our circle. They also share personal matters with me that I wouldn’t normally expect a friend to disclose.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

You all know I meditate, you've seen me in my yoga gear doing my thing, but this playlist is NOT meditation music. This is what happens after you finish your practice and you're still in that slightly elevated state but you're not sitting still anymore. You're making coffee, stretching in your living room, maybe getting ready to go out, and you need something that keeps you there without putting you to sleep or snapping you back to regular programming. That's the frequency shift.

I made that cover photo with the color blocking thing (I think it's called a triptych? Whatever, I just kept applying different filters until it looked trippy) because that's kind of the whole point. Same person, same room, but the light's different so everything looks different. That's what this music does. It's not about escaping reality, it's about seeing the same reality through a slightly different lens. The playlist is neo-soul (modern soul music with jazz and R&B, really lush and introspective), trip-hop (basically atmospheric beats with soul, kind of moody and hypnotic, very 90s but it's having this whole revival right now), and downtempo electronic stuff that sits right in that sweet spot between too chill and too energetic. The combination keeps you in motion without being aggressive about it. Like you can move around your space, you can think, you can be in your body, but you're still elevated. 

And we're in Aquarius season right now, so there's something Nicolas Tesla said that keeps coming back to me: ""If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."" That's why it's called FREQUENCY SHIFT. Music literally changes your vibration, and right now with the Sun, Venus, and Mercury all in Aquarius, the whole cosmic frequency is shifting toward innovation, new perspectives, different ways of seeing.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Whether you're streaming on public Wi-Fi, accessing geo-blocked content, or just want an extra layer of security, using a VPN on your phone is one of the smartest moves you can make. The good news? It’s easy, fast, and requires no technical background. Here’s a simple guide on how to get started with a VPN on both Android and iPhone devices.

# Why Use a VPN on Your Phone?

* **Privacy Protection:** A VPN hides your IP address and encrypts your internet connection, making it much harder for websites, apps, or hackers to track your online activity.
* **Secure Public Wi-Fi:** Coffee shops, airports, and hotels often have unsecured Wi-Fi. A VPN ensures your data isn’t being watched or stolen.
* **Access Blocked Content:** Want to watch something that’s not available in your country? A VPN can help you bypass those annoying restrictions.
* **Avoid Data Throttling:** Some mobile providers slow down your internet speed after you reach a certain limit. A VPN can help avoid that by hiding your activity.

# How to Set Up a VPN on Android

1. **Go to Settings:** Open your phone's settings and tap on “Network & Internet.”
2. **Tap VPN:** If you don’t see it directly, tap “Advanced” and then find “VPN.”
3. **Add VPN Profile:** Tap the “+” or “Add VPN” button. Enter the required details like the server address and type of VPN.
4. **Save and Connect:** Once saved, tap on the VPN profile, enter your login info, and tap connect.

*Tip: Make sure to allow the VPN to always stay connected or auto-connect for better protection.*

# How to Set Up a VPN on iPhone

1. **Open Settings:** Tap on “General,” then scroll down and tap “VPN & Device Management.”
2. **Tap Add VPN Configuration:** Choose the type of VPN (usually IKEv2 or L2TP).
3. **Enter Server Info:** Fill in the server, remote ID, and authentication details.
4. **Save and Connect:** Once you’ve saved it, toggle the VPN switch on.

*You can also set your VPN to connect automatically when needed.*

# Final Thoughts

Using a VPN on your phone is one of the easiest ways to stay private, secure, and free online. It takes just a few minutes to set up, and the peace of mind it brings is well worth it. Whether you're browsing, streaming, or working on the go, you’ll know your digital life is protected.

A few months passed and I turned 18. The 22 year old was flirting with me (he first called me 'my love') and I was telling my friends (at the time) and they were encouraging me to reciprocate the feelings so I flirted back. He drew hearts on my coffee, invited me to a party with other 20+ year olds (I never went to the party), his friend would tell me to check up on him as if he was hinting something. This went on for months. I then received a massive paragraph from the 23 year old saying that the 22 year old didn't mean it and that he was just being nice. I then found out the 22 year old got a girlfriend who changed her whole aesthetic - she was a copy of me (she was 20). The 22 year old then became more distant and cold, where as the 23 year old got closer to me. The 23 year old said he had a girlfriend but they have not seen each other in person since 2020 and they only met up once in real life. Over the summer holidays the 23 year old kept asking if I would like to go on 'adventure time' and explore different areas around; he would drive and I would pick music. We would always end up in children's parks. I also have an interest with 'littlest pet shops' and he started to get into them and buy them for me and himself. He also sent me an instagram post of when people would show their outfits with LPS and said we should do that; so we did. His favourite music is metal music and he for some reason likes Melanie Martinez too - Melanie is my favourite and she's not metal. He also saw I wore a carabiner and bought one himself so we could 'match' - why was he looking there? And he would tie pink bows on his jeans - pink is my favourite colour. He would also buy me random gifts often and remember every small detail I told him. He bought my best friend a Rodd's coffee without even really knowing her and he drove 40 minutes away to buy it for her. He remembered every little detail I or anyone told him. Time passed I was 19, he was 24, I then moved away and he would constantly visit - from like 7am up until 2am. He would cook for me and we would watch films. Like I said, he would stay until very late and he wanted to cuddle for hours on end. I also recently got a boyfriend around this time. He acted really cold towards my boyfriend and he stopped messaging as much. On my birthday card he had marshmallows hugging and he also drew hearts. Recently he asked to come up and visit, I asked if he could bring my best friend up too but he asked an hour later if he could come up by himself. He did come up on his own and he kept making jokes about the twin towers and that my boyfriend would say the 'N' word - he would never. He also made jokes about my height that I was as tall as an 11 year old. We spent the day in shops and the plan was not to go back to mine once he left but he was adding games to my boyfriends Nintendo and said he could not do it without signal and he would finish it when we get back to mine - essentially inviting himself over. My boyfriend then gave him a hotspot and it worked - we did not need to go back to mine. He also gave me christmas presents - £25 worth of chocolates, a lego which he mentioned once that I looked like a certain animal months ago, and a hot wheels - hot wheels is his favourite thing and NOT MINE.

AI “memory” right now is going through the same phase databases went through before indexes and schemas existed. Early systems just dumped everything into logs. Then we realized raw history isn’t memory, structure is.

Everyone seems to be betting that if we just stuff 1M+ tokens into a prompt, AI 'memory' is solved. Honestly, I think this is a dead end, or at least, incredibly inefficient for those of us running things locally.

Treating Context as Memory is like treating RAM as a Hard Drive. It’s volatile, expensive, and gets slower the more you fill it up. You can already see this shift happening in products like Claude’s memory features:

* Memories are categorized (facts vs preferences)
* Some things persist, others decay
* Not everything belongs in the active working set

That’s the key insight: memory isn’t about storing more , it’s about deciding what stays active, what gets updated, and what fades out.

In my view, good agents need Memory Lifecycle Management:

1. **Consolidate**: Turn noisy logs/chats into actual structured facts.
2. **Evolve**: Update or merge memories instead of just accumulating contradictions (e.g., ""I like coffee"" → ""I quit caffeine"").
3. **Forget**: Aggressively prune the noise so retrieval actually stays clean.

Most devs end up rebuilding some version of this logic for every agent, so we tried to pull it out into a reusable layer and built **MemOS (Memory Operating System)**. It’s not just another vector DB wrapper. It’s more of an OS layer that sits between the LLM and your storage:

* **The Scheduler**: Instead of brute-forcing context, it uses 'Next-Scene Prediction' to pre-load only what’s likely needed.
* **Lifecycle States**: Memories move from Generated → Activated → Merged → Archived.
* **Efficiency**: In our tests (LoCoMo dataset), this gave us a 26% accuracy boost over standard long-context methods, while cutting token usage by \~90%. (Huge for saving VRAM and inference time on local setups).

We open-sourced the core SDK because we think this belongs in the infra stack, just like a database. If you're tired of agents forgetting who they're talking to or burning tokens on redundant history, definitely poke around the repo.

I’d love to hear how you guys are thinking about this:

Are you just leaning on long-context models for state? Or are you building custom pipelines to handle 'forgetting' and 'updating' memory?

Earth: ease, grounding, natural fabrics, low impact fashion, prints, embroidery & textures to add visual interest, approachability. Accessories like wood, leather, leaf, flower, bird or feather earrings. Earthy perfumes as well, often with patchouli, coffee, musk...

He was the ceo of the company I worked at, I was just a middle manager. We met and hit it off instantly, he was kind, smart, funny and just an incredible person. We started off as friends, went for coffees and walks, eventually he asked me out and we went for dinner a couple of times. We first kissed on valentines day. Eventually I called it off because he would become very unresponsive, not talk to me for days on end and would go weeks without seeing me. He said it was because he was busy with his child (a single father) and obviously work keeps him very busy and stressed. I told him I understand and respect that, but I need to focus on myself because I feel neglected. He asked for time to sort his life out and put a couple of things in place, I said of course. 

There was a sudden switch up in July, he became way more available, affectionate, would take me out every week and made it clear he wanted a commitment. He asked me to be official and exclusive on the 9th of August. After that things changed. He became very dominant, gets upset about every small thing. I kind of brushed it off because I tend to let people walk all over me and treat me like garbage. 

He had a bit of a health scare while he was traveling for work and needed insurance information. He gave me the log in details to his email so I can find a copy of his ID and insurance that he needed urgently and did not have on him. While I was trying to find the info through searching his received and sent messages I uncovered that he was in fact in a relationship when we met in January, ended the FOUR YEAR relationship in August just before asking me out. This explains why he all of a sudden had more time and also now that his ex was gone he directed all his jealousy and aggression towards me. 

I confronted him and he claimed it wasnt even a ""real relationship"" anyway we still fight over it and I still feel betrayed. Despite this I am still with him, he gave me a ring, asked my mom's permission to marry me we moved in together. 

He does a lot for me, says the sweetest things, and gives me gifts. However if I dont act in a way that he approves of he turns really nasty. I cant even type out all the arguments we have had because it will take the entire night. Our final fight was a week ago. It was a close friend's birthday and she wanted to go for a hike followed by a brunch. He was working in the morning, so I suggested that I go on the hike with my friends and then after work we all meet up for brunch. When he found out that my friend's husband might also attend he completely lost it, said the only reason I wanted to go was to wear my tight gym pants around my friend's husband. He went on for hours, calling me rubbish, a slut, called me a f-ing idiot, fat and ugly etc etc it was really harsh. The next morning while he was at work I packed up my stuff and I am now with my mom (it is not the first time he blew up at me like that but it was def the worst). 

I think anyone reading this will basically say that I should leave him and stay by my mom. The thing is, his health took a serious turn and he now needs to go in for a very serious operation, there is a big possibility that he may pass away on the table, or pass away if he doesnt go. He phoned me shaking and crying, asking forgiveness. 

I know that he has good in him, and he did not have a great childhood and faced a lot of abandonment and rejection. He currently has no one really there for him, no close friends. His mom and brother are in the picture I guess, but not really active. 

  
Do I stay? I would feel awful having him go through the operation alone. But I fear it will continue and just get worse if I stay. ",2,1769176228.0,relationship_advice,8,0.75,False

I remember when I first got them, I thought it would be a fresh start, but nobody tells you what it’s like to live with a piece of plastic in your mouth for decades.

The thing that’s really getting to me lately is the **loss of taste**. I feel like I haven't truly enjoyed a meal in years. I can’t feel the heat of my coffee or the texture of my food because the roof of my mouth is always covered. It’s like there is a wall between me and everything I eat.

Even worse is this **persistent metallic taste**. It’s like I’m sucking on a dirty penny all day long. No matter how many mints I use, that ""old metal"" flavor is always there in the back of my throat. It ruins my morning coffee and makes me feel like my mouth is just... stagnant.

And then there’s the **morning routine**. Every single day I wake up with this thick, sticky mucus in the back of my throat. It’s sour and I have to spend ten minutes in the bathroom just clearing it out before I can even talk to my husband. I try to keep them clean with the usual tablets, but I still feel like I have this ""unclean"" smell that I just can't get rid of.

I wear them 24/7 because I'm too embarrassed to let anyone see me without them, but I’m starting to wonder if I’m just making myself sick.

On my wedding night, I thought I was marrying Merrick, the man I truly loved—only to discover it was his older brother Garrett, paralyzed for six years.

Garrett deeply resented himself because I had once been with Merrick.

Five years later, when Garrett asked me to retrieve his lost ring, I accidentally fell into the sea and drowned.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself back on the day I went to search for that ring.

\-

Priscilla returned to the Crawford's villa, her body battered and soaked through.

She clutched a diamond ring tightly in her hand.

Entering her room, she saw her husband, Garrett, seated in his wheelchair, dressed in a finely tailored dark suit.

He ignored her disheveled appearance, his voice cool as he inquired, ""Did you find it?""

Priscilla handed him the ring.

""Don't lose it again.""

She couldn't go searching for him anymore.

A flicker of something unrecognizable passed through Garrett's eyes at the sight of the ring, yet his words were curt. ""You were slow.

""Go kneel in the chapel.""

Priscilla was accustomed to his mercurial temperament. She simply fetched a blanket and carefully draped it over his legs.

""All right. I'll go in a moment.

""It's getting colder now. Don't catch a cold when you go out.""

A car accident eleven years ago had damaged Garrett's legs, abruptly ending the promising future of the family's golden boy and leaving him wheelchair-bound.

His health had never fully recovered, leaving him vulnerable to illness.

Her concern drew a scornful laugh from him. ""Five years of this charade. Doesn't it wear on you?

""It's my brother you love, yet you play the devoted wife for the world to see.

""It's disgusting.""

Priscilla wasn't angry. ""You should rest. I'm going to the chapel.""

She turned and left without another word.

Watching her slender, retreating figure, Garrett finally registered that she was soaked through.

He frowned slightly and summoned a maid. ""Have the floors cleaned wherever she walked.""

His gaze fell to the blanket on his lap.

""And dispose of this.""



\---

On her knees in the Crawford family's small chapel, Priscilla felt cold to her core. Her eyes were fixed on the somber pictures of the family's ancestors.

""So it was true. There is an afterlife,"" she thought.

She had drowned while searching the sea for Garrett's ring. The Grim Reaper told her, ""Your marriage was never consummated. The path ahead is closed to you.

""Sever the tie within three days. After that, you may proceed.""

Her options were stark: consummate her marriage with Garrett or divorce him. Only then would her soul find rest.

But Garrett felt nothing for her but disgust. Affection was out of the question.

Five years ago, the Burnett family was drowning in debt, pursued relentlessly by creditors.

Then Merrick—Garrett's younger brother, and also a celebrated racing driver—had arrived with an offer: 1.6 billion dollars for her hand.

On her wedding night, the deception was revealed.

The man waiting was not Merrick, her boyfriend of three months, but his older brother, Garrett, who had lived with paralysis for six years.

Garrett's hatred for her was rooted in her past romantic relationship with Merrick.

When Priscilla sought a divorce from the Crawford family, Merrick warned, ""Divorce Rett if you wish. Just return the 1.6 billion dollars.""

But her mother and brother had already used the money to settle their debts. Repayment was impossible.

Seeing her helplessness, Merrick had laid down her new duty.

""You're part of the family now. Your role is to care for Rett.

""Our family will manage the Burnett family's affairs.""

For her family's survival, she forced down her bitterness about the deception. Tending to Garrett became her duty—the only way to settle the immense financial obligation of 1.6 billion dollars.

Somewhere along the way, her feelings for Garrett had begun to change...

Just then, a maid's voice carried from the hallway.

""Welcome home, Mr. Merrick.""

Merrick's voice, tinged with happiness, followed. ""Mm.

""Cara and I are to be married soon. Replace all the flowers with the roses she loves.""

Caroline Murphy was the cherished heiress of the powerful Murphy Group.

She was not only Merrick's fiancée, but also Garrett's ex-girlfriend.



\###Chapter 2

The staff murmured their assent.

Once Merrick was gone, their hushed conversations resumed.

""Caroline is a piece of work. Engaged to marry Mr. Garrett, then she breaks it off after his accident.

""She's set to marry Mr. Merrick.

""Both brothers fell for her...""

Someone sighed softly. ""Poor Priscilla.

""I heard Mr. Garrett made her search for a ring—the very one he used to propose to Caroline.""

A sharp pang shot through Priscilla's heart when she heard their conversation.

She had long known that Garrett's true love was Caroline, and she knew the profound significance that ring held for him.

That was precisely why she had risked her life to retrieve it for him, never imagining it would cost her own.

Priscilla knelt in the cold chapel all night. Soaked through, she felt no chill.

Early the next morning, she rose stiffly.

It took her a long moment to steady herself before she could walk, trembling, out of the chapel.

Once outside, she saw her mother, Monica Burnett, standing in the courtyard as if she had been waiting.

""Mom, what brings you here?""

Seeing her daughter's disheveled hair and wrinkled, soaked clothes, Monica frowned.

""You look nothing like a young lady of the Crawford family.""

Priscilla lowered her gaze and explained, ""I searched for a ring for Rett yesterday and accidentally fell into the sea...""

She wanted to tell her mother about her own death, but Monica cut her off.

""I came today because I need your help with your brother.

""His investments failed again. We've already mortgaged the family company. You must ask Rett for help.""

Priscilla hesitated before finally voicing the thought that had taken root.

""Mom, I want a divorce from Garrett.""

Monica stared at her, momentarily speechless.

Then her expression hardened. ""Don't be absurd!

""A divorced woman? Who would marry you then?

""And what would become of our family without the Crawford family?""

Priscilla's heart constricted. ""What if I said I'm dying, Mom?""

Monica dismissed the notion outright.

""If you die, you die as his wife!""

Then, with a final statement, she turned and walked away.

""I have to go. Remember what I said about helping your brother.""

Priscilla stood for a long time, watching her mother leave, before finally returning to her room.

Once there, she took a hot shower.

Even immersed in the steaming water, she felt no warmth.

Her blood no longer flowed, her skin deathly pale. She applied heavy rouge after bathing to make her look normal.

When she was finished, she retrieved the document from a drawer—prepared long ago for this moment.

She made her way to the study.

Garrett was seated behind the desk, reviewing documents.

He glanced up as she entered. ""Here to ask for more money for your brother, I suppose.""

Priscilla was momentarily speechless.

Before she could respond, he continued, his voice laced with scorn, ""Tell me, did I marry you, or your entire family?""

Steeling herself, Priscilla explained, ""You're mistaken. I need you to sign a document.""

She placed it gently on the desk before him.

Garrett's gaze fell upon the bold text printed on the cover: Divorce Agreement.



\###Chapter 3

A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes. In five years of marriage, this was only the second time Priscilla had mentioned divorce.

The first time, she couldn't produce the 1.6 billion dollars, so she had to let it go.

Now she dared to bring it up again.

Garrett couldn't help a cold laugh. ""Using divorce to threaten me for money?""

Without waiting for her reply, he tossed the divorce agreement into the wastebasket.

""You chose to marry a cripple for money. Now you get to live with that choice for the rest of your life.

""Get out.""

Priscilla instinctively took a few steps back. When Garrett was angry, he refused to listen to anything.

Discussing divorce was impossible now.

""We'll talk when you've calmed down,"" she said.

With that, she turned and left.

Leaving the study, Priscilla quietly closed the door behind her, only to turn and bump into a solid chest.

She looked up and saw Merrick's defiantly handsome face.

Dressed in his red-and-white racing suit, Merrick instinctively took a step back, putting distance between them.

""Priscilla.""

Priscilla was about to respond when she noticed Caroline standing behind him, wrapped in a crimson coat.

She was radiant. With her impeccable makeup and rare, high-end jewelry, Caroline carried herself with elegance and wealth.

""Ms. Burnett, it's been a while.

""You look terribly worn out.""

Her eyes swept over Priscilla, filled with pity.

In the past five years, Priscilla and Caroline had crossed paths many times, but Caroline never addressed her as ""Mrs. Crawford"", always sticking to ""Ms. Burnett"".

""I haven't been sleeping well lately,"" Priscilla replied calmly.

""I have things to attend to. Excuse me.""

She hadn't gone far when Caroline's voice, faint yet clear, carried from behind. ""Don't forget, she became Rett's wife through a transaction you facilitated.

""But she looks so pitiful...""

Their voices gradually faded away.

A self-mocking smile touched Priscilla's lips as she continued toward the main living room.

Upon entering, she saw her mother-in-law, Chloe Crawford.

In an elegant dark dress, she was trimming rose stems and arranging them in a vase.

Chloe's expression cooled the moment she noticed Priscilla.

""Cara and Rick will discuss their wedding plans over lunch today. As the eldest daughter-in-law of this family, must you present yourself like this?

""You're deathly pale. Who are you trying to impress?""

Without waiting for a response, Chloe looked at Priscilla's flat stomach.

""Five years, and still no sign of a child. Did we spend 1.6 billion dollars to bring a decorative piece into this house?""

A bitter taste rose in Priscilla's throat.

""Chloe, the truth is, Rett and I have never been intimate in these five years.""

Chloe was visibly startled, her words catching in her throat.

""Could it be that Rett is...""

Priscilla understood her mother-in-law's unspoken suspicion and shook her head.

""Rett is perfectly healthy. He simply doesn't want me.""

She continued, ""Chloe, I want to divorce him. Can you help me?""

Chloe's brow furrowed deeply as she studied Priscilla.

The woman looked ghostly pale and frighteningly thin, as if a strong gust could topple her—hardly the picture of a woman fit for motherhood.

Yet she seemed skeptical. ""Do you truly wish to divorce Rett? Your family would actually give up the Crawford family's backing?""

Priscilla nodded.

""You're a woman too. You must understand what it's like to live as a wife in name only for five years.""

The moment the words left her mouth, Chloe laughed.

""Who would have thought that behind that gentle, virtuous facade, you're so desperate.

""If you're that desperate for a man, fine. I agree. I'll see to it that you get your divorce.""

Priscilla ignored the scorn in her mother-in-law's words, relieved only by the promise.

This lifetime had brought her only misery.

Once she divorced Garrett, she could finally find peace.



\###Chapter 4

Soon, the luncheon began.

It was then that Priscilla fully understood the stark difference between people.

She, the so-called eldest daughter-in-law of the Crawford family, and Caroline, the soon-to-be second daughter-in-law, were treated worlds apart.

Seated beside Garrett, Priscilla watched as Chloe—who never did any domestic chores—personally sliced fruit for Caroline.

She watched as her father-in-law, who had seldom spoken to her in five years, instructed the staff to place all of Caroline's favorite dishes before her.

Merrick peeled shrimps for Caroline.

Even Garrett's gaze remained fixed on Caroline throughout.

For the first time, Priscilla learned what it truly meant to be a cherished daughter-in-law in the Crawford family.

The agonizing luncheon finally ended two hours later.

As usual, Priscilla wheeled Garrett to his study for a video conference with the Crawford Group's senior executives.

Once in the study, as she helped him transfer from his wheelchair, his hand accidentally brushed against hers.

He paused.

""Your hands are freezing.""

Priscilla was momentarily taken aback. ""I guess what I'm wearing isn't thick enough.""

At her words, Garrett withdrew his hand, his usual detached manner returning instantly.

""My meeting is about to start. You may go.""

""Alright.""

Priscilla turned and left the room.

Garrett disliked being interrupted while working. As always, she waited outside the door, staring out at the snow that had begun falling quietly at some point.

Though she barely felt the chill, she instinctively wrapped her clothes a little tighter.

For a moment just now, she had almost believed Garrett was showing concern for her.

Suddenly, laughter drifted up to her.

She glanced out the window.

Down below, Caroline had her arm through Merrick's, the two of them admiring the snowfall.

""Rick, enjoying the first snowfall with you at your home means we're meant to grow old together,"" Caroline said.

Merrick had always been cavalier, yet this simple statement brought a deep blush that crept from his ears to his neck.

""We will,"" he answered, his voice uncharacteristically shy.

Priscilla had never seen Merrick blush before.

Five years ago, before she married Garrett, Merrick had pursued her with relentless intensity.

He'd skipped a major race he'd trained six months for, just to go shopping with her.

He'd confessed his feelings for her on live television after winning a championship.

Sweet words flowed effortlessly from him when they were together.

But he'd never blushed.

It seemed a man only grew truly shy around the woman he genuinely loved.

Just then, Caroline's voice pulled Priscilla from her thoughts.

""But I'm feeling a bit nervous.

""Priscilla is so capable. I worry I won't live up to that, and you'll all slowly start to dislike me.""

Merrick laughed fondly and drew her into an embrace.

""You and Priscilla aren't the same.

""She came into our family as part of an arrangement to look after Rett. You're joining us because you're loved and wanted.""

Reassured, Caroline nestled into Merrick's arms, and they stood quietly watching the snow.

Priscilla couldn't quite define the ache in her chest.

Although Merrick stated a simple fact, hearing it aloud left her feeling unsettled.

At four-thirty in the afternoon, Priscilla went to the kitchen.

Every day at five o'clock sharp, Garrett required a cup of Americano, brewed by her personally.

Though he disliked her, he enjoyed the coffee she prepared.

Today was almost over, leaving her with only one day remaining. After that, she would no longer make coffee for Garrett.

She jotted the coffee-making steps on a sticky note and attached it to the machine.

Then, she found herself adding a second note.

""Helps you focus, but rest is important too.""

Putting the pen down, she placed this note beside the coffee mug.

Once the coffee was ready, Priscilla checked the clock: 4:50.

Her limbs stiff, she carried the mug to the study.

The door stood partly open.

Caroline's words reached her clearly. ""Rett, my wedding to Rick is in two days. I don't want to marry him. If you can divorce her, I'll back out today.""



\###Chapter 5

Priscilla froze in place.

Caroline and Merrick had just been sharing a sweet moment in the snow...

Yet, she needed to hear Garrett's response.

Through the gap in the door, she saw a rare flicker of anger in Garrett's usually impassive eyes.

""Caroline, what game are you playing with Rick and me?

""You broke off the engagement the minute I was injured. Priscilla stayed.

""I'm not divorcing her. You should go.""

Caroline wasn't ready to yield.

""Did you know my parents made me break it off?

""I tried everything to fight them—refusing to eat, hurting myself. Nothing made a difference.""

She paused before continuing, ""Everyone knows Priscilla's brother burns through money. She only stuck around for your family's wealth.""

Garrett said nothing, as if accepting the statement.

At her explanation, his face lost some of its earlier severity.

Then Caroline asked, ""If you won't divorce her, is it because you love her?""

""I never loved her.""

Garrett's answer came instantly, without hesitation.

At the words, Priscilla's hand trembled, making the cup rattle on its tray.

The door swung open immediately.

Caroline went pale seeing her.

""How long have you been standing there?""

Priscilla pushed down the swell of emotion inside. ""Since you asked him to divorce me.""

Hearing that, Caroline dropped all pretense of politeness. Her parting words were a direct order.

""Don't you dare repeat any of this.""

Once Caroline was gone, Priscilla stepped into the study.

She placed the tray down and handed the coffee to Garrett.

""Your coffee, Rett.""

Garrett knocked the cup over. ""Did you make a habit of eavesdropping?""

It hit the floor with a sharp crack, shattering.

Hot liquid splashed over Priscilla's hands and clothes, her skin reddening.

She felt no pain, only murmured, ""I'm sorry. It won't happen again.""

Then she bent to pick up the broken pieces.

At that moment, Garrett threw a blank check onto the floor in front of her.

""Write whatever your brother needs.

""I don't want a single word about this getting out.""

The sight of the blank check struck Priscilla as deeply ironic.

""Is this for my silence?""

""Think whatever you want,"" Garrett said, his voice icy.

Priscilla looked down. For a second, when Garrett spoke of her staying by his side, she had actually thought he recognized her loyalty.

But it was just to get a reaction from Caroline.

Priscilla stayed quiet, focusing on cleaning the spill.

Then, dark blood began to drip from her nose. She wiped at it with the back of her hand, but it kept coming.

She had no choice but to take the check and go back to her room.

In the room, as Priscilla was cleaning the blood from her face, she heard the door open.

""It's done. You and Rett are legally separated.""

Chloe's voice came from behind her.

Priscilla turned. Chloe held out a formal document.

It was a divorce certificate.

Five years ago, the Crawford family had obtained the marriage licenses for her and Garrett without either of them needing to be present.

They had ended it the same way.

Seeing her silence, Chloe spoke again, mistaking it for regret.

""When do you intend to leave?""

Priscilla gathered herself. ""Tonight.""

Tomorrow, she would be gone for good...



\###Chapter 6

Chloe gave a cold laugh. ""In such a rush. Your family isn't just social climbers—the women in your family seem absolutely desperate to land a man.""

She continued, ""Go if you must, but Rett doesn't hear a word about this until the wedding is over.

""I don't want your presence putting a damper on our family's happiness.

""And once you leave, stay away from us. For good.""

With that final remark, Chloe left.

Priscilla put the certificate away and, as usual, saw to Garrett's dinner.

Heavy snow fell outside. Instead of their walk in the gardens as usual, Priscilla helped him back to his room early.

When he was ready to retire, Priscilla assisted him to bed.

But after two days, her body was stiff and unresponsive.

As Garrett lay back, she lost her balance and fell against him.

For a moment, she seemed to hear the sound of his heartbeat.

The subtle, clean scent of his skin surrounded her.

""Sorry.""

Priscilla pulled away quickly, her fingers stiff and awkward as she tried to smooth his clothes.

Garrett noticed her clumsiness and frowned.

""Five years, and you still can't manage this properly?""

The words left Priscilla momentarily disoriented.

""Five years, yes...""

She heard herself ask, ""There's something I've always wanted to know.""

""What?"" Garrett's tone was flat.

Priscilla looked directly at him and asked, ""Did you ever love me a little?""

Silence hung in the air.

Garrett met her gaze, then looked away.

""Never.""

She had expected that.

A faint smile touched her lips. Her hand, resting on his chest, moved to undo the buttons of his pajama tops.

""Since you never truly cared for me, just be with me tonight.""

Garrett's brow furrowed. ""What did you say?""

Priscilla held his gaze.

""I want to sleep with you as your wife.""

Garrett stared, taken aback, as she continued unfastening the buttons.

Only when her hand moved lower did he catch her wrist.

""Priscilla, I don't sleep with women I feel nothing for.""

Seeing the complete lack of desire in his eyes, Priscilla paused. Shame washed over her, her cheeks burning.

She pulled her hands back and pushed herself up with effort.

""Get some rest.""

Garrett said nothing more. He turned on his side and closed his eyes.

Priscilla quietly drew the covers over him.

She turned off the light and went back to the sofa she'd used for five years.

Only when Garrett's breathing became slow and even did she finally rise and go to the study.

She didn't see his eyes open the moment the bedroom door shut.

In the study, Priscilla smoothed a sheet of writing paper on the desk.

She picked up a pen and began to write.

""Rett, by the time you read this, I'll be gone.""

""You might not believe me, but these last five years, my feelings for you were real.""

""I know you never stopped caring for Caroline. Now that we're divorced, you're free of a wife you never wanted.""

""May you spend your life with someone who truly matters to you.""

Her handwriting was clumsy, her fingers too stiff to hold the pen properly.

When she finished, she carefully placed the letter, along with the blank check and his divorce certificate, into the second drawer on the left side of his desk.

That drawer held all his keepsakes of Caroline: photographs, letters...

When she was done, Priscilla couldn't help one last look at Garrett.

She returned to the bedroom.

In the faint light from the streetlamp outside, she watched him sleep soundly and murmured silently in her heart, ""Goodbye, Garrett.""



\###Chapter 7

Then, taking only her own divorce certificate, Priscilla left the Crawford's villa.

She stepped outside the gates, snow still falling steadily.

Priscilla looked at the document in her hand, brushing off the flakes that had settled on it.

Now she was no longer a daughter-in-law of the Crawford family, nor Garrett's wife.

She was just herself.

She was finally free to leave.

But first, she wanted one last look at her mother and brother.

Her movements were more stiff as she made her way to the curb and hailed a taxi.

""Westheimer Road, number fifty-nine.""

Thirty minutes later, she arrived at her parents' house.

She approached the front door and keyed in the security code she knew by heart.

The door stayed shut. A cold, automated voice responded.

""Invalid code. Please try again.""

Priscilla paused, then tried several more times. The same message greeted her each time.

They had changed the code without telling her.

Snow settled heavily on her, dusting her hair and eyelashes white.

She felt no physical cold, but a deep chill settled in her heart.

She understood it then. For a woman, adulthood meant being without a true home. Neither her parents' house nor her husband's house was really her own.

Priscilla remained standing there through the night.

The sky gradually lightened at dawn.

Muffled voices reached her from inside—her mother and her brother, Raymond Burnett.

She was about to knock when Monica's voice grew louder as she moved closer to the door. ""Ray, I saw your sister yesterday. Can you believe she told me she wants a divorce?""

Raymond sounded stunned. ""A divorce?

""The Crawford family paid us 1.6 billion dollars for her to marry Garrett, that invalid.

""If she leaves him, how are we supposed to pay that back?""

At his words, Priscilla's hand froze mid-air. Disbelief washed over her.

She had always blamed Merrick for the arranged marriage. She never knew her own family had sold her.

Everyone knew. She was the only one kept in the dark.

Her knuckles turned white.

A sudden, overwhelming fatigue hit her.

Just then, the front door swung open.

Monica, standing behind it, stared at the sight of Priscilla—deathly pale and blanketed in snow.

""Lurking out here in silence! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?""

Priscilla looked at her mother, eyes growing moist. ""I'm back, Mom.""

Monica frowned.

""You're married. What are you doing here?""

Priscilla didn't answer.

She carefully pulled the formal document from inside her coat and held it out.

""Mom. Garrett and I are legally separated.""

Monica stared, speechless for a moment.

She snapped back to reality and struck Priscilla with a sharp, stinging slap.

""Who said you could do that?

""Didn't I make myself clear? You die as a Garrett's wife!""

A metallic taste flooded Priscilla's throat. Dark red blood seeped from the corner of her lip.

Drop by drop, it stained the pristine snow at her feet.

She looked at her mother numbly. ""Mom, I am dying.""

Rage flashed in Monica's eyes. She shoved Priscilla backward.

""Then go die somewhere else!""

Priscilla landed hard in the snow. The hand she braced against the ground was so pale that it was almost indistinguishable from the snow.

She looked up at her furious mother, unable to speak.

Monica glared down at her.

""If you're not dead, get back to the Crawford's villa on your knees. Apologize to his parents. Apologize to Garrett.

""Beg for their forgiveness. Beg him to take you back.

""Or I swear, I'll disown you. Don't you ever come back here.""

Any last hope Priscilla held for Monica died then. She pushed herself up with great effort.

""Don't worry. I won't come back.

""I just wanted to see you both one last time.""

Wiping the blood from her mouth, she added, ""Dad supported you when he was alive. The Crawford family has supported you since he died.

""You'll have to manage on your own now. No one is coming to support you.""

With that, she turned and walked away into the relentless storm.



\###Chapter 8

In the Crawford's villa, Garrett woke to an empty room.

Priscilla was gone.

The staff entered to help him begin his day.

Seeing them, he frowned slightly.

""Where's my wife?""

A maid answered promptly, ""The housekeeper said Mrs. Crawford returned to her parents' house, sir.""

Garrett said nothing.

His expression remained cold as they assisted him.

Priscilla knew he disliked being helped. She always made sure he was settled before attending to anything else, no matter how urgent it was.

""Is it because I turned her away last night?"" he wondered.

After breakfast, Garrett went straight to his study.

He had just opened his laptop when Merrick walked in without knocking.

Garrett looked up, puzzled. ""What is it?""

Merrick hesitated, then spoke his mind.

""Rett, my wedding is tomorrow. I need to hear you say it. That you feel truly happy for Cara and me.""

He knew about Caroline and his brother's past.

He needed this settled before he married her.

A chill entered Garrett's eyes.

""I wish you both happiness,"" he said slowly.

Hearing that, Merrick finally relaxed.

""Thank you, Rett.""

As he turned to leave, he noticed Garrett's pallor.

""You look awful. Are you okay?""

For a second, Garrett seemed uneasy.

""Didn't get much rest. I've got work to do. Leave me alone.""

In truth, he hadn't slept at all, only closing his eyes briefly near dawn.

""OK.""

After Merrick left, Garrett took out his phone.

He opened a private, locked album containing 1,390 photos of Caroline.

He selected all and deleted them.

Then he blocked her number and all her WhatsApp account.

Finished, he looked out the window.

The snow continued to fall, heavy and unceasing.

Almost without thinking, he picked up his phone and sent a message to Priscilla.

""When are you coming back?""

An hour passed. No reply came.

His frown deepened. He sent two more.

""If you like it there so much, then stay.""

""If you're not back today, don't bother coming back at all.""

He set the phone aside and focused on his work, ignoring it completely afterward.

Priscilla never replied.

That evening, Merrick's bachelor party filled parts of the house with friends, while everyone else there bustled with his wedding preparations, except Garrett.

He stayed alone in his room, reading.

Suddenly, he heard his door open quietly. Assuming it was Priscilla, he asked coldly, ""Decided to return?""

But when he turned, it was Caroline standing there, her eyes red.

""What are you doing here?""

Caroline asked, the question sharp with accusation, ""You blocked me on everything. Why?""

""I'm marrying your brother tomorrow. Do you really want to stand there and watch?""

Garrett saw the hurt in her eyes. His fingers tightened around the pages of his book.

""Everyone lives with their choices.

""You'll be my brother's wife. We should keep our distance.""

Caroline's heart sank at his words.

""If that's how it is, at least make sure Ms. Burnett keeps our secret.""

Garrett looked away, avoiding her gaze.

""Priscilla isn't one to gossip.""

Caroline watched him for a long moment, then offered a bitter smile.

""You know, Rett?

""The way you just defended her reminds me of how you used to defend me when you loved me.""

Garrett closed his book and looked at her, his expression blank.

""You should go.""



\###Chapter 9

Caroline gave him one long, last look, then left.

Only after the door clicked shut did Garrett look toward where she had been standing, then back out the window, watching her figure disappear into the distance.

He took out his phone again. Still, no reply came from Priscilla.

What he didn't know was that Priscilla had already purchased a burial plot for herself.

After leaving the Burnett's residence, she had gone to the funeral home.

She bought a plot next to her father's, then paid the staff to arrange her own funeral service.

By the time she finished, it was evening.

Priscilla stopped at a florist for a bouquet of white roses, then hailed a taxi.

""Evergreen Cemetery, please.""

The driver hesitated for a moment at the destination, then replied, ""Sure.""

On the road, the driver's wife called. He spoke to her gently.

""Sweetheart, I'll be home for dinner after this ride.

""If it gets too late, don't wait up.

""I love you.""

Through the rearview mirror, Priscilla saw his smile linger long after the call ended.

That sort of happiness was something she'd always yearned for.

Garrett would never speak to her with that kind of tenderness.

Catching her pale reflection in the mirror, the driver asked, ""It's late, miss, and snowing hard.

""Are you sure your family knows you're going to the cemetery alone?""

Priscilla tried to smile, but her face had grown too stiff.

She answered slowly, ""I don't have any family left.

""Last night, my husband and I separated legally.

""This morning, my mother and brother disowned me.""

""I'm sorry..."" The driver was taken aback, quickly apologized, and fell silent.

Watching the snowy landscape pass by, Priscilla felt she finally understood why she hadn't been able to move on—her ties to this world weren't fully severed.

In this world now, she had no one left to miss and nothing left to care for.

Two hours later, they arrived at the cemetery.

The driver dropped her off and drove away.

Priscilla walked through the gates and laid the roses at her father's headstone.

She checked the time: 11:30 PM.

She had fallen into the sea at midnight. Only half an hour remained...

Her gaze lifted to her father's portrait on the headstone, a gentle smile captured in the monochrome image.

""Dad, I'll be with you soon.""

Speaking to the air, she dragged her rigid body to her own adjacent plot.

Leaning against the headstone, she took out her phone and sent a WhatsApp message to the funeral director.

""Please come to Evergreen Cemetery first thing tomorrow.""

""Bury me deep. I don't want to be walked over.""

Only then did she notice Garrett's three messages.

""When are you coming back?""

""If you like it there so much, then stay.""

""If you're not back today, don't bother coming back at all.""

After a long moment, she decided to say goodbye.

She dialed his number. When he answered, his voice was icy.

""It's 11:45. What do you want?

""If you're done being my wife, then stay gone.""

Fifteen minutes remained.

Blood rose suddenly in Priscilla's throat, spilling onto her white coat.

She wiped at it clumsily.

""Don't worry,"" she managed. ""I'm already somewhere you'll never find.""

Garrett let out a cold, dismissive sound.

""What are you talking about? Get back here.

""Or don't ever come back.""

She kept wiping the blood from her mouth as he spoke, but it kept coming.

""Garrett, I can't come back.""

She struggled to speak, but Garrett said nothing in return.

A long silence passed before Garrett's voice returned. ""Fine. Stay with your family, then. I don't want to see you again.""

With a sharp click, the call ended.

Priscilla listened to the dial tone with a faint, pained smile. Her thoughts began to blur. ""But my family doesn't want me either...

""I picked a good spot right next to Dad. He dedicated his whole life to the family. Now I can keep him company.

""Finally, I'm only my own.""

She murmured as the blood flowed freely, too weak to wipe it away.

Slowly, her stiff body grew still, the faint rise and fall of her chest fading.

The moment her consciousness faded, the phone slipped from her hand.

The screen still glowed, showing the time: 00:00.",1,1769175951.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1qkr68l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkr68l,"[Review] Honest Ratings on 9 Items: Eric Emanuel, Moncler, Gucci, Ami, MM6, Polo RL & Accessories (187cm/72kg)","\### 1. Eric Emanuel EE Basic Short (Black/Bone)

\*\*Review:\*\* Classic EE mesh shorts. The fit is the standard boxy cut, sitting just above the knee which is exactly what I wanted. The mesh is breathable, making it perfect for the humid weather here. However, the ""bone"" print feels a bit thick and rubbery compared to other EE pairs I've owned; I’m a little worried it might crack after a few washes.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 8/10

\### 2. Moncler Large Logo T-Shirt

\*\*Review:\*\* The cotton feels premium and smooth, definitely heavy enough to not be see-through but not too hot. The fit is true to size for a slim fit. My main gripe is the large embroidered logo—it’s quite stiff. When you sit down or hunch over, the logo bunches up awkwardly on the chest and feels a bit like a cardboard plate. It looks great standing up, but comfort takes a hit.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 6.5/10

\### 3. Gucci Interlocking G T-Shirt

\*\*Review:\*\* Honestly, a bit disappointed with this one. The print looks decent from a distance, but the blank itself feels surprisingly thin for a ""luxury"" tee. It doesn't hold its shape well around the collar after wearing it for a few hours. For 180cm, the length is okay, but the sleeves flare out weirdly. It’s okay for a flex, but the quality doesn't match the hype.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 5/10

\### 4. Ami Paris Heart Logo Sweatshorts

\*\*Review:\*\* These are a highlight. The french terry material is super soft and comfortable. They have a nice relaxed fit without looking sloppy on my legs. The embroidery on the red heart is clean with no loose threads. Great for lounging or a casual coffee run. No complaints here.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 9/10

\### 5. MM6 Maison Margiela Numbers T-Shirt

\*\*Review:\*\* Very solid tee. The print is crisp and the placement is centered perfectly. It has a slightly oversized/boxy fit which suits my build well. The cotton feels durable. It’s a simple piece, but executed well. Nothing crazy to report, just a good daily driver.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 8.5/10

\### 6. Polo Ralph Lauren ""London"" Big Pony Polo

\*\*Review:\*\* I love the color, but the design is a bit ""busy"" in person. The embroidery is heavy, and combined with the metal vents under the arms, the shirt actually feels quite heavy to wear. The collar is also a bit stubborn and doesn't lay completely flat. It fits well (custom slim fit usually works for me), but it’s not the most comfortable Polo I own.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 7/10

\### 7. Vivienne Westwood Orb Socks

\*\*Review:\*\* Can't go wrong with these. They are nice and thick, and the Orb embroidery is detailed. They add a nice subtle flair to an outfit when wearing low-top sneakers. They stay up well and don't slide down the calf.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 10/10

\### 8. Polo Ralph Lauren Cap (Navy)

\*\*Review:\*\* Standard dad hat. The wash on the navy is nice, giving it a slight vintage look. The brim came a bit flat, so I had to curve it myself, but that’s standard. Fits my head shape well. It’s a basic staple, does exactly what it's supposed to do.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 8/10

\### 9. Alo Yoga District Trucker Hat

\*\*Review:\*\* I wanted this for gym runs. The material is lightweight and synthetic, so it doesn't soak up sweat like cotton. However, the crown is a bit high/boxy for my taste; it sits kind of tall on the head. The logo application is clean, but the shape just isn't 100% right for me.

1qkr5zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qkr5zp/what_would_call_this/,what would call this ??,"I was at a very low point in my life a few months back—all alone, depressed, bored, hopeless, not wanting to live anymore. So I decided to fuck around a little bit to cheer myself up. I was working during the day and driving all around the city with loud music and reckless speed, not returning till it was bright, and continued doing this for 2 weeks straight. I work 7 days a week, so no sleep and no break—mornings on black coffee and nights on Red Bull and cigarettes. I would circle the entire city at least twice every night 😂, blasting my playlist and giving no fucks. I skipped sleep for 2 weeks straight, and before I realised it, I was starting to take microsleeps at work or would miss out on a few minutes of conversation without realising it.

After a week, I sensed people around me were starting to notice weird changes in me. I was always listening to music, working, or playing video games, waiting for the night desperately. Night brings complete freedom—no one around to notice my weirdness, just a fast car and loud music bringing a sense of euphoria. I would take a questionable amount of caffeine, Red Bull, and nicotine to keep my eyes wide open.

Even after realising that people around me were getting concerned about my strange behaviour and sudden change, I decided to keep doing it and test my limits. During the second week, voices got blurred; I was not able to read, write, or even talk properly. My brain basically shut down. I was like a zombie roaming around. My face started to turn black, my body shivered, and I felt very cold and shaky. I would zone out anywhere, anytime.

It was only during driving that I was fully concentrated and could feel the music—cigarette after cigarette, caffeine over caffeine—taking my life unseriously, completely forgetting the difference between night and day. I was taking dumps irregularly, like most of the organs in my body had stopped. I could feel my heart beating painfully hard at one point. But strangely, after the first week, I was so habituated that I lost the habit of sleeping. I knew I was going into microsleep without realising it, mostly when I was sitting idle. By the 10th day, my face started to turn black.

I knew I was destroying myself, but I never felt so euphoric before and wanted to continue as long as I could. But it had to end. I was embarrassing myself at work—people thinking I had gone mad. I completely lost my senses and logic during this phase, but it was the only thing bringing peace to me. Soon people started avoiding me at the workplace. No one knew what was happening and thought I might have gone mad.

I lost my appetite after the first week. I only had black coffee, cigarettes, and dates or some fruits—had no energy even to chew. But the only motivation that kept me going was the extreme sense of freedom over time. I completely lost the sense of time. Sometimes an hour would pass without even realising it (maybe I slept during that time without knowing).

But during those two weeks, I lost the world and found myself laughing and screaming in joy during those lonely nights. It gave me a sense of realisation that I am enough alone. Trust me, when you are alone, magic happens, and you experience life without any influence—that’s the raw reality. It holds joy, laughter, tears, anxiety, and all other feelings that can be described mixed up together, and you laugh crazy. You lose the world and find yourself in the truest form.

I never wanted to break this cycle until it started showing on my body—my face turned black, I started seeing things blurry, walking weirdly, sleeping while standing. On the 14th day, I gave up. This experience felt like a rebirth to me.",1,1769175860.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

\*\*Review:\*\* Classic EE mesh shorts. The fit is the standard boxy cut, sitting just above the knee which is exactly what I wanted. The mesh is breathable, making it perfect for the humid weather here. However, the ""bone"" print feels a bit thick and rubbery compared to other EE pairs I've owned; I’m a little worried it might crack after a few washes.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 8/10

\### 2. Moncler Large Logo T-Shirt

\*\*Review:\*\* The cotton feels premium and smooth, definitely heavy enough to not be see-through but not too hot. The fit is true to size for a slim fit. My main gripe is the large embroidered logo—it’s quite stiff. When you sit down or hunch over, the logo bunches up awkwardly on the chest and feels a bit like a cardboard plate. It looks great standing up, but comfort takes a hit.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 6.5/10

\### 3. Gucci Interlocking G T-Shirt

\*\*Review:\*\* Honestly, a bit disappointed with this one. The print looks decent from a distance, but the blank itself feels surprisingly thin for a ""luxury"" tee. It doesn't hold its shape well around the collar after wearing it for a few hours. For 180cm, the length is okay, but the sleeves flare out weirdly. It’s okay for a flex, but the quality doesn't match the hype.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 5/10

\### 4. Ami Paris Heart Logo Sweatshorts

\*\*Review:\*\* These are a highlight. The french terry material is super soft and comfortable. They have a nice relaxed fit without looking sloppy on my legs. The embroidery on the red heart is clean with no loose threads. Great for lounging or a casual coffee run. No complaints here.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 9/10

\### 5. MM6 Maison Margiela Numbers T-Shirt

\*\*Review:\*\* Very solid tee. The print is crisp and the placement is centered perfectly. It has a slightly oversized/boxy fit which suits my build well. The cotton feels durable. It’s a simple piece, but executed well. Nothing crazy to report, just a good daily driver.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 8.5/10

\### 6. Polo Ralph Lauren ""London"" Big Pony Polo

\*\*Review:\*\* I love the color, but the design is a bit ""busy"" in person. The embroidery is heavy, and combined with the metal vents under the arms, the shirt actually feels quite heavy to wear. The collar is also a bit stubborn and doesn't lay completely flat. It fits well (custom slim fit usually works for me), but it’s not the most comfortable Polo I own.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 7/10

\### 7. Vivienne Westwood Orb Socks

\*\*Review:\*\* Can't go wrong with these. They are nice and thick, and the Orb embroidery is detailed. They add a nice subtle flair to an outfit when wearing low-top sneakers. They stay up well and don't slide down the calf.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 10/10

\### 8. Polo Ralph Lauren Cap (Navy)

\*\*Review:\*\* Standard dad hat. The wash on the navy is nice, giving it a slight vintage look. The brim came a bit flat, so I had to curve it myself, but that’s standard. Fits my head shape well. It’s a basic staple, does exactly what it's supposed to do.

\*\*Rating:\*\* 8/10

\### 9. Alo Yoga District Trucker Hat

\*\*Review:\*\* I wanted this for gym runs. The material is lightweight and synthetic, so it doesn't soak up sweat like cotton. However, the crown is a bit high/boxy for my taste; it sits kind of tall on the head. The logo application is clean, but the shape just isn't 100% right for me.

1qkr4i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1qkr4i2/what_if_your_nervousness_around_women_is_actually/,What If Your Nervousness Around Women Is Actually Intelligence? A Reframe That Changed Everything For Me.,"I used to think I was broken. Bullsh\*T

Every time I'd see an attractive woman at a coffee shop, a party, or even just walking down the street, the same thing would happen. Heart racing. Mind going blank. That familiar tightness in my chest. While other guys seemed to glide through conversations effortlessly, I'd be standing there like a deer in headlights, convinced something was fundamentally wrong with me.

Then my therapist said something that completely rewired how I see this.

""You know what your nervousness actually is? It's your brain doing exactly what it's supposed to do. You're not broken you're perceptive.""

She explained it like this: Nervousness around women you're attracted to is your brain rapidly processing an enormous amount of social information. You're reading micro-expressions, anticipating outcomes, weighing risks, analyzing context. Your mind is running a thousand simulations per second because *you actually care about the interaction going well*.

The guys who feel nothing? They're often not thinking at all. They're running on autopilot. They're not reading the room they're just *in* the room.

Your nervousness isn't weakness. It's pattern recognition firing on all cylinders.

Think about it. Anxiety is fundamentally about *anticipation*. And anticipation requires imagination, memory, and the ability to model future scenarios. These are marks of intelligence, not deficiency. Studies have actually shown correlations between social anxiety and higher verbal intelligence, greater empathy, and more accurate threat detection.

Your brain isn't malfunctioning. It's doing advanced calculus while other people are doing basic arithmetic.

The problem isn't the nervousness itself it's *how you interpret it*. When you label it as ""I'm a nervous wreck,"" you spiral. When you label it as ""my brain is working hard right now,"" you can actually use that energy.

Here's what changed for me:

I stopped trying to eliminate the nervousness. Instead, I started *expecting* it and reframing it as preparation, not panic. That racing heart? That's energy I can channel. That blank mind? That's my brain clearing the cache for something important.

I also realized something crucial: Women aren't looking for someone who feels nothing. They're looking for someone who feels *and acts anyway*. Vulnerability isn't the absence of fear it's the presence of courage despite it.

The most charming people I know aren't fearless. They're people who've learned to dance with their fear instead of fighting it.

So the next time you feel that familiar wave of nervousness, don't curse yourself. Recognize it for what it is: your intelligent, perceptive brain doing its job. Then take a breath and move forward anyway.

Your nervousness isn't the enemy. Your interpretation of it is.",2,1769175752.0,LockedInMan,1,0.67,False
1qkr467,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qkr467/am_i_overreacting_or_is_she_lying_to_me/,Am I overreacting or is she lying to me?,"So a few months ago, I met this girl at a party, and honestly, things were going great. Easy chemistry, good vibes, no obvious red flags. I knew early on that she’d been on dating apps before we met, and maybe even right at the start of us talking, but that didn’t bother me at all.

Fast forward a bit. One night we’re lying in bed together, just talking, and out of nowhere she asks if I’m seeing anyone else. I tell her no, then ask her the same thing. She says no too. I even make it very clear that I genuinely don’t care if she’s still using dating apps or meeting other people, as long as she’s honest and upfront about it. She swears she isn’t. Cool. Conversation over. Everything feels solid.

A few weeks later is where things start to feel...off.

She’s sitting next to me on her laptop, casually doing her thing, when I catch a glimpse of her messages. One of the chats is saved as “XY tinder"" Instant pit in my stomach.

Later on, I bring it up. She tells me they met up “just as friends” and that nothing happened. They’ve apparently known each other for a while, yada yada, and it was just a quick coffee. Okay. Maybe.

So I ask her why she never mentioned it, especially since she usually gives me detailed, excited play by plays of her entire week. Her answer is that she thought it was irrelevant and didn’t think I’d find that story interesting.

That answer really didn’t sit right with me.

Now I’m stuck here seriously considering ending things, not because of the coffee itself, but because the trust I thought we had suddenly feels shaky. Am I overreacting here, or does this whole thing feel off to you?

edit:

one thing I also forgot to mention is how weird she started getting after I spoke to her about that thing. she kept mentioning stuff like how she'd be happy to have a threesome with another girl and me (something she said she would never do at the beginning of our meetups and not that it interests me anyways). how she would love for us to go on a trip together and she'd even pay for it. it all feels like she is trying to bribe me or something. it all feels off...",2,1769175728.0,whatdoIdo,9,0.75,False

2. I tell them I’m Korean (I’m half Japanese too but they don’t need to know that hehe) and I don’t understand
3. and they say like oh you’re really pretty, can we have some tea, coffee or Line

Best case, they just stare in silence. Worst case, they interrupt you with questions and advices you didn't ask for, while you’re trying to actually fix the problem. Seconds feel like hours, and every eye contact feels loaded with disappointment and contempt.

IT Security had once again messed around with policies and dumped a pile of unnecessary problems on users who rely on multi-user MS Office setups on a single device, like the one in this meeting room. Took me a while to explain that they would have to use their own devices for the meeting. To make the setup as painless as possible, I urgently needed a dock station. We have a guy in the team responsible for purchasing and handing out hardware, but nothing is ever urgent with him. I grabbed a used dock from the storage cabinet and hoped it still worked. Voila — it did.

Everything looks fine. Problem solved, or at least postponed, and the meeting continued. So why do I still feel useless?

I created a ticket for documentation, closed it, and moved on to the next task: printer issue.

# Coffee Beans Reddit: Elevating Your Daily Brew Beyond the Forum

That Reddit thread about the perfect coffee beans, right? We get it. There’s a tangible excitement that builds with the anticipation of a fresh bag of coffee – the aroma that fills the kitchen, the bloom as hot water hits the grounds, that first perfect sip. But the truth is, the quest for truly exceptional coffee often leads beyond online discussions to the source and the roast.

At Intelligentsia, we’ve been at this for a long time. Before ""Direct Trade"" was a buzzword, we were building genuine, long-term partnerships with farmers, paying premium prices for coffee that pushed the boundaries of quality. This isn't about simply buying beans; it's about investing in people and their craft. What does this mean for your cup? Unparalleled flavor clarity and a traceable story from farm to roaster.

The secret to coffee that truly sings, whether you’re brewing a pour-over or pulling a shot of **Black Cat Espresso**, lies in freshness and intentionality. Our **Roast-to-Order** model ensures your coffee is never sitting on a shelf. It's roasted precisely for you and shipped immediately, capturing peak flavor. For those seeking the pinnacle of fresh, ethically sourced beans, we offer:

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Your coffee is roasted within days of shipping, guaranteeing vibrant aromas and dynamic flavors.

1qkqwpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qkqwpl/a_life_spent_waiting_for_you/,a life spent waiting for you,"Hi. It’s me. I’m sorry for blocking you last year. I just needed time. I know I had a specific amount of time to speak to you and that was on me but I just didn’t want to wait around to hear from you again. I wasn’t ready to speak to you then. I didn’t expect you to decide to message me after half a decade on a random Saturday. I shouldn’t have responded but I did because I couldn’t ignore it. 

I probably shouldn’t but I do miss you. I’ve never met anyone like you and I’ve been upset that we just ceased to exist in eachother’s lives when that’s not what I chose. But I don’t think that I can be friends with you. I think I told you this. Maybe I can. I’ve been basing any assumptions that I have on the person I knew 6 years ago. Maybe you’re not half as charming now.

I never thought I’d hear from you again and that took me an awful long time to recover from and you kind of came and tore that all up with a nonchalant apology like you’d spilt coffee on me once. Not that you’d broken my heart.

I think I’m on my third rewrite of this because I don’t know what the perfect thing to say is. I don’t want to say too much but I also don’t want to not say enough. 

I believed that one day we would encounter eachother again. I’d stand behind you in a queue. I’d catch a glimpse of you crossing the road. I’d see you at your window when I drove past your flat. All by chance, never intentional. It’s sad that I thought I’d only ever be reminded that you’re real by sheer coincidence and not because you would contact me. But you did. And it punched me straight in the face.

I don’t know how you feel, I wish I did. I’ve felt silly all these years for regarding you so highly. For thinking of you all of the time. But you must feel even slightly similar, right? I mean, 6 years? That’s written off. No contact. Radio silence. Nothing. But you were thinking of me. And I take some validation from that, that I wasn’t crazy for still wondering because you were thinking of me, too.

Maybe I’ll never send this. Not because I don’t want to but because I know that I’d be protecting my peace if I didn’t. Saving myself from a wash of old emotions that I’d be best spared of. Reminders of all of the silly, immature things that I did to just feel closer to you then. All of the nights that I spent crying and you were with her. When you drove me home for the last time and I foolishly begged you to stay with me. The things that you did that tore my soul from my body.

I try to convince myself that talking to you would be closure. Maybe I’ll understand why you did what you did as if it matters. But that won’t happen. You’ll give me a sheepish answer, I’ll believe it and I’ll be more confused than I was before. I almost have to minimise my upset over what happened because in the long run, why does it matter? But it does for me. I don’t know why. So we shouldn’t talk. 

But it’s you. It’s you and I want nothing more than to speak to you. I’d like to know who you are now and to just, have a conversation with someone I cared about so much. To see how you are. To tell you how I am. To clear stuff up that’s been sat on me for years. I’m not angry or upset. I’m just… exhausted by my own inability to stop thinking about the opportunity to talk to you. 

So, I’m here. Probably waiting for you. As always. ",2,1769175183.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

Psychology says YES and here’s why it works,"Every week someone says, “I just didn’t feel a spark…” after a first date. It’s become the modern dating death sentence. Blame swiping culture, TikTok therapists, or rom-coms. We’ve been taught that real love should feel like an instant dopamine hit  fireworks, butterflies, a click. If it doesn’t? Move on to the next. But here’s the truth: most people are terrible at judging connection on the first date.

This post is for anyone who’s unsure if they should go for that second coffee. It’s not your fault. A lot of what we call “chemistry” is actually **anxiety, novelty, or even trauma bonding packaged as attraction**. Real compatibility unfolds over time. So let’s unpack this with what actual research says  not what your For You Page told you at 2am.

Here’s why you shouldn’t over-trust the “spark” test:

- **Early chemistry is often misleading.** According to biological anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher (Match.com’s lead science advisor), that electric spark is usually a result of heightened dopamine from novelty and uncertainty, not actual connection. In fact, initial fireworks can blind you to deeper incompatibilities.

- **Love, especially secure love, often starts slow.** Psychologist Amir Levine (author of *Attached*) notes that “anxiety-driven connections” are often mistaken for deep chemistry, but they’re unstable. People who are securely attached AKA the people who make great partners often come off as boring or flat at first. Their calmness doesn’t light up your nervous system, so you dismiss them.

- **Judging attraction too early is unreliable.** A 2020 meta-analysis in *Psychological Bulletin* found that **interpersonal attraction increases significantly through repeated exposure**, especially when the other person is warm, responsive, and consistent. The more time you spend, the more likely you are to feel that elusive “spark” later.

- **Your brain confuses adrenaline with attraction.** Neuropsychologist Louann Brizendine explains this in *The Female Brain*: if your first date was high-stress (crowds, nerves, awkward vibe), your body might interpret anxiety as disinterest. But that doesn’t mean there’s no potential.

- **You’re not auditioning for a movie role.** In real life, attraction evolves. Studies from Stanford’s sociology department found that **couples who felt “meh” initially often grew into stronger, more fulfilling relationships** than those who had instant fire.

Bottom line? The spark is sexy but unreliable. Warmth, curiosity, and consistency are better long-term predictors of connection. If they were kind, interesting, and aligned with your values, that’s more than enough reason to see them again. The second date is where real connection often starts.",1,1769175147.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

When i came back from the store, I just realised, the privilege of just walking out across the street and getting what I want at like 10 in the night. 

No shops closing by 8pm. Not having to put on 30 layers of clothes just so my fingers don’t become numb from cold. Not having to hike up a huge incline for 1km straight just to reach a shop. If there’s an emergency I can literally just use blinkit and someone will deliver the item I need at any time of day. 24x7 365 days no exception. 

All this while i was missing the mountains like hell from the moment we took off from Bagdogra. 

I still miss them tho. I just have this huge hangover of the trip 😭😭. 

Also genuine question, why haven’t we invested as much in these places that these amenities are a luxury there while its just mundane for us. ??? Is it like purely logistical issue? Or is it something geopolitical? Cuz like when I mentioned 24 hour open restaurants our driver literally went like “reallyyy?” Like he’d never heard of it. To him it was a luxury.

*Before we continue, I’d like to address a few questions that come up now and then:*

***""Can’t you make these shorter?""***

*1. Believe it or not, the original source material is longer and more disorganized, especially with the irrational types. I select excerpts related to the chosen Information Elements and sort them by topics. I can cover less topics at a time, if that helps.*

*2.Vague generalizations in type or self-descriptions like ""they like helping people and don’t express negative emotions toward them"" are useless because they mean different things to different types. Real-life examples illustrate the ""how & why.""* 

*3. Hearing different people describe the same concept from various angles creates an immersive effect. You begin to see the underlying mechanisms of their words and actions. Eventually, you start recognizing these same patterns in every other topic they discuss.*

*4. These examples don't just show the IE mentioned in the post title; they reveal ""tails and ears"" of other elements, dichotomies and small groups. Think of these texts as a safe playground to practice your identification skills.*

***""What if I don't perfectly relate to these examples?""*** 

*That’s normal. Upbringing, environment, and personal choices all play a role. Even two people of the same type, who grew up in the same city, will tell different stories.*

*Look for the underlying mechanisms. This brings us back to why I keep the texts long.*

**Perception of Time and Change: A Constant, Ever Changing Flow**

**Alexey R.**: “Time is a stream, a river. It flows through us and along with us, changing everything—usually irreversibly. I love watching the flow of passing people; in such moments you acutely feel the passage of time, like the analogy of “sand slipping through open fingers.””

**Anna M.**: ”In a single minute, many interesting thoughts can come, and you can feel so much. Time is what we feel, think, and do.

<…> I sense time in different ways. Time can stop, flow slowly, or race swiftly. It is a river that can be full-flowing, or it can turn into a trickle, become a quiet backwater or a swamp. That is how I feel it.

If I think about the physical nature of time, I realize that time does not exist. There is the Universe, and it is constantly changing its state. The sensation of time is the sensation of the change of states. There is no time; there is only a sequence of events.

A slowing of time means few events, few impressions.

An acceleration of time means many events, many changes of state.

When time is running, it means many events are happening and life is rich, with many changes inside and outside—and that is when time runs. If nothing changes, time slows down, and a state of complete stillness is death, one could say.

I want time to move like a full-flowing river. The river of time flows through me; I am filled, life is abundant, full-blooded. The river of life, and I am within it—then I fully open up. All my abilities and possibilities unfold. If time slows down, I am closed, doing nothing, and stopping altogether is death.”

**Development and Temporary Nature of Life and Processes, A Global Perspective on the World Destiny, Life Purpose**

**Alexey R.**: “Understanding the meaning of life depends on many factors: upbringing, faith, previous experience. From my point of view, the answer is contained in the very phrase “the meaning of life.” Life over time is evolution. Therefore, the meaning of life is the meaning of evolution, or the meaning of development.”

**Anna M.**: “To live, one must develop. Everything has its beginning and its end—every phenomenon and every person. This is something you can feel. But you don’t always understand when the end is coming, and that’s why you want to know in advance. Every person’s life has a beginning, a peak, and a completion. This is an objective reality. Nothing is infinite. Everything has a beginning and an end. It was a great revelation for me to learn that our universe will disappear. And humanity will disappear too. But then you realize that it transforms into some other quality.

We will all die—we will move into another quality. All processes have both a beginning and an end—this is something I feel very clearly.

The sense that a certain process is coming to completion comes from within: that’s it, now it will end, it’s finishing now.

Development is life, and life is development. If I am not developing, I am not living. Moreover, it’s as if fate itself pushes me to develop. Sometimes everything seems fine—work suits me, everything is good at home: a state of bliss, of pleasure—wonderful. And suddenly fate starts arranging some troubles—something happens at work that pushes you, or some problems arise at home—and then I know that I have stopped developing. That’s it, it means I need to do something; I’ve noticed this about myself. And my inner state is such that I want peace and calm. But peace leads to death—I understood that very clearly.

And when troubles happen in my life, I understand that I have stopped developing. When you live in a state of pleasure, it seems that everything is fine, but in reality, stopping is death.”

**Elya G.**: “The feeling that life is transient and finite has always been very strong in me—a strong sense of the vanity of earthly life and its futility. Sometimes I watch people fussing about and think: “Why are you all fussing over trivial things, worrying so much? You’re all going to die anyway—better think about your soul.”

That’s why I don’t want to waste time; I want to do something good, kind, and eternal in life. I want to do something good for people, even if only for one person—not because of official or family ties, but simply because he is a human being and you are a human being. Then life has not been lived in vain. Then you have lived life not only to eat, drink, and grab.

I really liked a line from a film, spoken by the main character: “No matter what happens in life, a person must love and hope. Always.”

The most important thing for me is, in any situation, to remain a Human Being, to act in accordance with the dictates of my soul.”

**Ekaterina N.**: “Sometimes I think about what the future will be like. Mostly there is a feeling that everything will be fine for me. Of course, sometimes a mood comes over you and you draw scary pictures in your head—about the emergence of some illness, or scenarios of global warming, the extinction of animals due to human fault. Then you think that anything can happen at all: a comet could collide with the Earth, and our form of life would disappear—and so what? There will be something else; there is nothing scary about it.

If you go deeper and deeper into your consciousness, you will understand, roughly speaking, that you are a grain of sand in the Universe. And people—what about them? They rush somewhere, hurry, and there is no meaning in it at all; we will all die anyway. And when some difficult circumstances arise, when everything presses on you, when a life situation becomes tense in a bad way, at that moment it seems to me that you need to relax a little and say to yourself: “Why are you actually twitching like this? What will change because of it?” And then, in that relaxed state, everything will somehow go by itself, and it will become easier. If you don’t do something here, it means you didn’t need to do it. Then it naturally turns out that you will do it later. Everything will be fine anyway. I don’t have a feeling that everything will be bad; I have a feeling that everything will be good!

Even if an asteroid collides with our Earth—well, there will be no Earth, no humanity, but there will be something else.

Our planet is 4.5 billion years old; humanity is about 2 million years old, of which we have been developing consciously for, at most, 50 thousand years. Sometimes you think that on the scale of the Universe our fuss means absolutely nothing.

In general, if all people thought about this, it would be easier to live. For some, this awareness would remove the “crown from their head,” and for others, on the contrary, it would give determination—there is nothing scary in our world, and one should not be afraid to take action.

In general, I live by the principle of King Solomon: “This too shall pass,” and “There is only a moment between the past and the future…”—and from this it follows that everything will be fine, and one’s “moment” should be lived with dignity and meaning. I would only like my family and loved ones to be with me throughout my life. For me, I suppose, one of the fundamental components of life happiness is not to outlive my children and grandchildren, and to communicate into old age with friends, interesting people, and like-minded souls.”

**Love of History, Reconstruction of the Past, Spirit of the Time/Era**

**Alexey R.**: “It’s easy to feel the spirit of an era if you have the appropriate props or a book—if you take historical books where a historical epoch is well described. In a film with a convincingly reconstructed historical setting, I feel that time very clearly.”

**Ekaterina N.**: “I liked history at school; I studied it. I would learn it and retell it to my grandmother. I really liked the pictures in the history textbook. The pyramids, and other things—I loved looking at everything. I imagined how things were back then and told everyone how people lived there. I remember we went with my parents to a holiday resort; their friends were with us, and I kept talking and talking about all the pyramids. It was a bit of a shock to me when one woman said that she had never heard of the Pyramid of Cheops at all.”

**Anna M.**: “The spirit of the time. I really like walking around our Kremlin: when I go there, I feel that spirit of the time.

It seems to me that I can even see how people lived there at the time when the Kremlin was being built. Sometimes I suddenly imagine how battles took place there—how they climbed the walls, shot, returned fire. In the Kremlin, historical time can be felt.

I love the historical part of the city: walking along the streets with old, dilapidated buildings—there I feel that time. Then I understand that I live in a rich city, rich in historical events, and that is very important to me. Before, I lived in military towns—they are empty, there is no history there. And where it’s empty, it’s not interesting.

I really love looking at old paintings in museums. I immerse myself in that time. There is a person in the painting, belonging to some era. I try to look closely and understand what they felt, how they lived, their facial expression. Their lives were completely different from ours. It was harder then, harsher, more brutal. Perhaps simpler in some ways—we have more complexity now; there was also the animal world then, but the strongest survived. I look at paintings and think: if a person was painted, that means they were one of the best representatives of that time.

<…> I really love reading historical books. But preferably factual material, not invented. When I read *Peter the Great* as a child, I sincerely believed that everything happened exactly like that. And when I later read actual history and realized there was a lot of fabrication, I experienced deep disappointment. That’s why now I want to read documentarily accurate works, so that impressions are formed on the basis of correct facts.”

**Dreaminess, Retreat into a World of Fantasies**

**Elya G.**: “I loved sewing outfits for my doll; I enjoyed it very much. All kinds of dresses. What I liked was not so much the sewing itself as inventing all sorts of stories in my head while I was sewing—stories with this doll. Her whole life unfolded in my mind: what she was like, who her prince was, what conversations they had. There were many fantasies. Dreams. An entire story took shape in my head, with all the little details. When I finished sewing the dress, I was no longer interested in it; I would just put it away in the closet. What mattered to me was the story of that dress.

The same thing happened when we went to the dacha with my parents. I didn’t like it there, it was boring, so I kept myself occupied by imagining stories. For example, that I had ended up in Koschei’s castle.

I was very interested in being alone with myself. I was a dreamy child.

As for books, I mostly loved adventure stories, historical novels, melodramas, and fairy tales. I don’t like horror stories, and I never did.”

**Good Memory for Past Events, Reliving and Analyzing Them (Te - Logic of Actions), Forecasting**

**Alexandra M.**: “In my memories, I always replay events like a movie, with successive actions changing one another. I remember them down to the smallest details. For example, recently my colleagues and I went to Vyksa. Separate episodes of the trip and my thoughts stuck in my memory like frames from a movie:

Here I am at home, getting ready.  
Here I am running out of the house.  
The sun is very bright.  
Here I am at the bus stop.  
Here a car pulls up.  
Oh, happiness—I’m not late!  
We’re driving. The car is beautiful, a silver Volga. The seat is soft, it’s not hot, the windows are tinted, the sun shines through them without being too bright—that’s good already.  
We’re going fast. Cool. Outside the window, the landscape. Trees that are just starting to turn green replace one another. In some places, however, there’s still snow.  
The driver, unfortunately, is not attractive at all—kind of gloomy, and the dark glasses really don’t suit him. Oh well, as long as he drives well. And he seems to be driving fine. So let him look however he wants. It’s his business, after all.  
And anyway, as long as no one bothers me. Otherwise, we’re driving nicely, with the breeze, even pleasantly.

<...> If I watch the film a second time, I can do something useful in parallel (a manicure, for example). That way, I kill two birds with one stone—my nails are done and I get a pleasant impression, or rather even three birds—plus I can stroll through my memories. I always immediately recall thoroughly:

* my state while watching the film the first time;
* all the circumstances of the viewing (where, when, with whom).

I can even name the exact date—for that I need to recall some event from that day, link it to a nearby event, and thus a chain of events is built. Among them there will surely be at least one whose date I remember exactly, and from there it’s not hard to count back.

Sometimes it seems to me that I would be a good witness, because I remember small circumstances and details well.

However, examining details often prevents me from grasping the essence of events.

For example, during my student years I could get distracted from the essence of a lecture by examining the sheets on which the lecturer’s text was written: yellowish—so he doesn’t use a computer, so the lectures are quite old, and so on.

In general, I always remember the circumstances of events better than the events themselves, and I mostly remember all sorts of little things that have nothing to do with the matter.”

**Alexey R.**: “Anticipation of what is to come and the aftertaste of what has already happened are felt more sharply over time than the present moment.

I feel well in which temporal slices (childhood, school…) what was happening. I clearly feel that in childhood there was this and that, at school—this and that… at university—this and that happened. The time periods of childhood, youth are clearly felt. I sense several lives, where one flows into another.

One could say that you live partly in the past.

All sensations and the analysis of understanding a situation come most fully only after some time. It turns out that the past sort of layers itself onto the present, partially pushing you out of the “here and now.” For example, we discussed some problem, and the most competent thoughts about ways to solve it come when you replay the situation in your head—that is, when you mentally move into the past. The same is true of the feeling from rest or vacation—it is always delayed in time; it is not perceived as sharply in the “here and now.” All the time it turns out that in the present you are reliving the most important moments from the past.

My memories are always in motion; there are actions there (I see them before my eyes, on an inner screen): how I lived, how it went—so it goes there. The image—how everything looked there—and my internal state are remembered. The sequence of actions is remembered well.

I can immerse myself in memories by association: you come across something familiar, and by association you begin to remember, immerse yourself, and simply drop out. When I have deep memories, I try to put things that evoke them far away. You can drop out. You’re walking down the street—a bush looks like something, or a puddle with a streetlamp reflected in it—and an image arises.”

**Ekaterina N.**: “I ""visit"" the past a lot. There are very many memories. In general, as a matter of fact, I was only recently thinking that right now I am here. On the one hand, all of this is being recorded; in principle, I track what is happening around me, but at the same time, at that very moment, I can be thinking about something that happened long ago.

I can recall some vivid event from the past, remember it there, imagine what happened, how I behaved, how I could have behaved differently, why people behaved in exactly that way, what they were thinking, what guided them. If later, after some time, someone asks me, “You were riding in a bus—do you remember anything there?”—then I recall those events in my memory. I know what was around me during that period of time, but at the same time my thoughts could have been in a completely different place, in some moment of my past.

You always analyze what you did, what it led to, what it will lead to. I often can’t fall asleep because these thoughts keep spinning in my head, spinning. If the day was intense, you constantly think about what happened, how you behaved, how you could have behaved, what people said, what they feel toward you… Analysis. It’s constantly going on in my head; I can’t even fall asleep. <...>

And today I had a dream: I was hurt in that dream, and I woke up angry at the people who hurt me. I woke up, my eyes were open, but I was still thinking through how, in the dream, I couldn’t respond to what was done to me there.”

**Anna M.**: “Nothing is ever accidental. Everything follows from something. There is always a reason for what has happened. It’s not always possible to see it, because there may not be enough data, but there is always a cause for everything.

Analysis is ongoing all the time. I know that a person has committed some act. I don’t understand why. I ask them: who are their parents, where are they from, what have they been doing—everything. I put all this together, and then it becomes clear to me why they committed that act. Or what state they were in, what was happening to them, why they did it—that is, this analysis is constantly going on for me. Of course, when there is no information, there is nothing to analyze—it’s like floundering in a void, with nothing to hold on to. I need a lot of information.

Then it can all be structured and understood. It’s very important for me to understand why all this is happening, where it begins, what it starts from. I ask myself, “Why do you need this?” So that I can predict what will happen next.

If I know a person—especially if that person is part of my circle, my family, for example my daughter-in-law—it is very important for me to understand what kind of person she is, how she lived, how she was brought up. Because if I don’t understand, I might get angry with her. And I cannot be angry with her, because my son loves her. But if I understand why she acts the way she does, I can forgive her, accept her, and understand her. In order to forgive, you need to understand the person.”

**Elya G.**: “The process of reflection is ongoing. I constantly analyze my life, my behavior, my emotions and feelings, trying to get to the root cause and to anticipate how it will all end.”

**Filtering and anticipating future trends (mostly negative ones)**

**Alexey R.**: “From my point of view, it is actually visible to the naked eye that, in general, things are getting worse rather than better year by year all over the world. The number of wars, cataclysms, and problems is increasing (this interview was recorded in 2007). A global crisis will definitely happen; even analysts say that oil is running out, and accordingly the modern economy itself is very unstable—any influence can trigger a collapse. The modern world is literally walking along a razor’s edge: one wrong move, and the world will start sliding downhill.

When in New York—I don’t remember what year—they cut off the electricity, there was a collapse there, and the entire city was plunged into darkness, terrible things were happening: looting, murders, and so on. The layer of civilization on the modern human being is very thin, and a very small push is enough for the planet to slide into crisis—you won’t be able to stop it.

The situation is very unstable. Global phenomena—broad strokes—are easy to trace. Smaller details are harder to figure out.”

**Anna M.**: “If a lot of information comes in, it’s possible to predict approaching events. If there is no information, I won’t predict anything. And sometimes I anticipate trends in art, or sense that certain ideas are in the air.

<...> ILI has a finely developed intuitive sense of approaching events. Shortly before the crisis, I periodically started feeling the urge to find another job.

I felt that I wouldn’t have enough money. Even though I was very lazy. I really enjoyed working only two days a week.

I kept persuading myself: “You have to, you have to!” I needed to enter that state of searching for a job. I knew that I had to find one—somehow I understood that I had to. It formed clearly in my head: I know that I must. I felt that it was vitally necessary for me and for my family. And so I began looking for a job.”

**Inner States**

**Anna M.**: “A premonition of events is the sensing of such states in the world that are bound to erupt into changes and lead to events. Negative changes can be avoided if one changes the states. This applies to the material world, the economy, and psychology.

Sometimes it seems to me that I can influence states. To do this, one must tune oneself to the desired event or state and want it very strongly. That is how wishes come true. Unfortunately, in a negative state, desires also lead to events that one subconsciously wants; therefore, it is very important to maintain a positive mood, feelings, and thoughts. When one remains for a long time in a state of emotional pain, irritation, or disagreement with fate and with life, the body perceives this as a command for self-destruction, and illnesses begin, bad events are attracted into one’s own life and into the lives of loved ones. Therefore, for the common good, one must maintain the purity of feelings, thoughts, and desires.

<..> ILIs have their own inner understanding of how one should live properly:

* to be in harmony of soul, body, and mind;
* to be in harmony with the surrounding world.

The most important thing is the state of the soul. A calm joy of life, the feeling that everything that happens is exactly how it should happen, the desire to live regardless of the events that occur to me, my loved ones, or other people.

It is better to struggle with one’s own shortcomings and to help another person if they ask for it.

It is important to love the world: people, animals, nature, the weather, and even an economic crisis (we created it ourselves for our own development).

An interest in life, in people, in the sciences—even at a popular-science level—adds bright colors to the quality of life.

<...> My most comfortable states are: a state of divine love for people and for the entire world; a state of bliss—*I live, life is beautiful*; I also really enjoy the state of working.

Inner states during the day, of course, change for many different reasons:

* first, because of one’s physiological condition: when you’re healthy, everything is fine;
* second, because of the weather: if there’s sunshine outside the window, everything is great. If it’s gloomy outside, the mood is bad.

There are methods to lift one’s mood: a contrast shower—immediately the whole body starts to react and the mood changes; drinking coffee—things immediately feel better.

It is very important to live at one’s own pace, in one’s own state, because only I myself should change my state.

<...> It is easier for me to maintain a good mood in solitude, listening to good music—classical or jazz. A good book, a good conversational partner also give an influx of pure energy...

<...> I love reading books that create comfortable states of mind. States are very important to me, and I like a light, pleasant state. Therefore, I find a pleasant book and can read it several times, because for me it is not information—it is a state. I enter into a state. As Pushkin once said: if you’re in a bad mood, “uncork a bottle of champagne and reread *The Marriage of Figaro*.”

I reread a good book, and my mood becomes good.

I remember from childhood: I read Jack London a great deal. After rereading one of his books, I felt such mobilization—I wanted to do everything. A person can do anything. That state of physical activity was transmitted to me very strongly, and I liked that state. I felt such mobilization: a person is capable of everything, will accomplish everything—just do it. And I began to do, do, and do. I understood that if you want to achieve something… I am as if under hypnosis when I read such books.”

**Perception of Atmosphere**

**Anna M.**: “The companies were completely different. When I walk in, I try to understand the state this team is in—my attitude toward the work and, accordingly, my success depend on that. One resonates with a sense of decay, another with a sense of rigidity: surveillance of employees, perfect renovations, strict admission regulations.”",2,1769174659.0,Socionics,0,1.0,False

price alerts? (market research)","Hey [r/commodities](https://www.reddit.com/r/commodities/),

I'm a software developer. Recently I've been thinking about a small side project, mostly for personal development, but ideally something that could grow into a tool that's genuinely useful for people working in commodities.

Very early idea: a simple, focused commodity price tracking & alert tool, aimed more at small desks / small teams than large enterprises - with alerts oriented around specific contract months rather than generic spot prices.

For example: instead of just ""Sugar price alert"", you could set ""Sugar Mar26 > $21"" or ""Coffee May26 drops 3%"". Plus some basic team visibility (see what your colleagues are tracking) without everyone getting flooded with each other's alerts.

The team angle I'm exploring: everyone has their own workspace (you track sugar, colleague tracks coffee), but you can see what others are watching AND occasionally share a critical alert with specific teammates, without everyone getting flooded with each other's daily alerts.

Before building anything, I'd love to hear from people who actually use these tools every day:

* How do you currently track prices and contract months in practice?
* What annoys you the most about your current setup?
* If you work with colleagues, how do you handle alert sharing? Does everyone track separately, or is it more collaborative?
* Does this problem even exist for you, or are current tools ""good enough""?
* If you were to design a price alert tool from scratch, how should it work?
* What features would be must-have vs nice-to-have?

Brutally honest feedback is very welcome. Even ""this already exists / this is a bad idea"" is helpful 😄

Happy to chat more in DMs if you prefer, or I can share more details once I hear your initial reactions.

Chapter 1


On Christmas Eve, eight months pregnant, I waited at home for my husband Wilfred Gallagher to return, my heart filled with anticipation.


But he burst through the front door in a panic, cradling his childhood sweetheart. When I stepped forward to help, he shoved me hard to the ground.


My belly hit the edge of the coffee table. Pain instantly shot through me, cold sweat slicking my skin, but Wilfred didn't even spare me a glance.


""Out of my way! Someone drugged Annie at the bar. If I don't help her, she'll die!""


Clutching my belly, I grabbed my phone. 


""I'll call 911 for you...""


Before I could finish, he ripped the phone from my hand and smashed it to pieces, then wrapped his fingers around my throat.


""Are you trying to ruin her reputation? If word gets out, how is she supposed to live with it?""


To prevent me from ""causing trouble,"" he ignored my desperate pleas and locked me out on the balcony, leaving me there in a thin nightgown.


""Stay out there and cool your head. Don't come back in until you've learned how to behave!""


I pounded the glass door in despair, tears streaming down my face.


Helpless, I watched as they carried out their shameless acts on the living room carpet, Christmas carols playing cheerfully in the background.


That night, heavy snow fell without pause.


Till the next morning, he finally remembered me.


He tried calling, but no one answered.


Furious, he cursed aloud, ""Delicia Kearney! Where the hell did you go? Annie's stomach hurts. Get your ass in here and make her some soup!""


What he didn't know was that I was still right outside the door. And the dead don't answer phones.


\*\*\*


Wilfred gripped his phone, his face dark with anger.


He stared through the floor-to-ceiling window at the balcony and sneered.


""Delicia, how long are you gonna keep up this act?


""Are you done playing the victim?""


He strode up to the balcony door.


The moment he held the doorknob, my soul, hovering in midair, trembled.


If he opened the door, he would see me curled up in the corner, frozen stiff like an ice sculpture.
But he didn't.


His gaze slipped through the gap in the half-drawn curtains and landed on the escape rope tied to the railing.


I had tied it there the night before, desperately trying to save myself.


But my hands and feet were already numb with cold, I had no strength left to climb.


Wilfred's eyes traced the rope downward, stopping at the delivery guy's footprints in the snow.


""Well down, Delicia. Quite the acrobat, huh?
""Even pregnant, you still managed to climb down two floors on a rope. Guess that belly pain yesterday was all an act, too!""


Shaking with rage, I swooped down to slap him, but my hand passed straight through his head.


Just then, Daily, the golden retriever lying by the glass door, let out a mournful whine.


It clawed at the glass frantically, nails screeching against it.


It caught my scent, knowing I was out there.


Annoyed by the noise, Wilfred lifted his foot and kicked Daily hard in the stomach.


""Shut up! Stupid dog!""


""Awoo!"" Daily whimpered, tumbling across the floor from the kick, but still tried to crawl back to the balcony.


""Wilfred, stop!"" I cried hysterically, lunging forward to shield Daily. ""How can you be so cruel?""


A memory came rushing back.


Three years ago, I was depressed after a miscarriage. I couldn't sleep at night and constantly thought about ending my life. One day, Wilfred returned home with a fluffy little golden retriever and gently placed it in my arms.

 He knelt beside my bed and wiped away my tears. ""Della, this is Daily. It means I'll love you every single day. ""When I'm not home, let Daily keep you company and protect you in my place.

 ""If anyone bullies you, I'll have Daily bite them.""

 Back then, his eyes had been full of love and care. But now, he had kicked my ""protector"" away, his gaze filled with nothing but disgust.

 Wilfred ignored the dog and headed into the kitchen for honey water, but returned empty-handed. A trace of discomfort crossed his face.

 Just then, Annetta Reeder emerged from the guest room, wearing my silk nightgown. Her neck was marked with hickeys from the previous night. ""Fred, what's wrong?"" she purred. Wilfred wrapped his arm around her waist and snorted coldly. ""Nothing. Just someone acting up.""

 Annetta glanced at the kitchen and said playfully, ""Since your wife isn't here, I'll get you some water. 

""By the way, she's got some real skills. Can you believe she actually climbed down the building while pregnant? ""I was worried she would be freezing outside last night. Guess I was worrying for nothing."" 

Hovering in the air, I glared at the hypocritical woman. For the past three months, it was she who had been chipping away at my marriage with nothing but, ""You're the only one I have left, Fred.""


 All it took was a slight frown or a whispered complaint of pain, and Wilfred would immediately assume I was being unreasonable. ""Annie only sees me as family. How could you think that way? It's so gross!"" ""Delicia, look at yourself. You're acting like a total shrew right now."" He had spent the past three months talking my ears off with those same words. From then on, in his eyes, I was nothing more than a crazy woman desperate for attention—even while eight months pregnant.


 Wilfred drained the water in one gulp, grabbed his phone, and called the property office.


 ""Change the access code to my front door. Delete the old fingerprints."" His eyes wandered to the balcony, sparkling with the thrill of revenge. ""Since you left, don't think you can just waltz back in! ""Let's see how long you can keep this little runaway act going."" I watched him hold Annetta in his arms, smiling affectionately.


 Wilfred, I wish I could leave, too. But the dead couldn't walk. Chapter 2 The next day, to force me to show up, to humiliate me, Wilfred intentionally paraded Annetta at the company.


 He drove the Porsche that was supposed to be mine and stepped into the private elevator, hand in hand with Annetta. At lunch, they went to his favorite restaurant. With an ingratiating smile, Annetta placed a braised pork into his plate.


 ""Fred, try this."" Wilfred took a bite, his brows knitting tightly. The greasiness of the meat made him nauseous. Subconsciously, he picked up his phone, opened the pinned ""Mrs. Gallagher"" chat, and hovered over the input box, hoping I would send him the medicine.

 In those days, whenever he felt queasy, I would deliver his medicine along with some soup to warm his stomach. He always gushed, ""Della, what would I do without you?"" Now, he froze in place. It dawned on him that I had ""run away"" from home.


 He slammed his phone down on the table and thundered, ""Forget it! I'm not eating this!""


 Annetta was startled, her eyes flickering nervously. Then she made up an excuse to use the computer to send an email. A few minutes later, she feigned surprise and exclaimed, ""My goodness! Fred, look! Isn't that your wife?"" On the screen was displayed a photoshopped image of two people hugging at the airport. The pregnant woman looked exactly like me, and the man was my senior from college.



 That single glance of his was the straw that broke the camel's back. 


""Good... Good!"" He stared at the screen, his eyes blazing red. ""No wonder she argued with me yesterday! She has a rebound guy all along!""


 I floated across from him, screaming, ""Wilfred! Are you freaking dumb? That photo is fake! The lighting is all wrong! And I wore a nightgown yesterday, not a trench coat! Just look at it!"" But jealousy and hatred had consumed him. 


That senior of mine had always been the one he couldn't get past. No matter how many times I had explained that we were only friends, he mulishly believed I was playing the field. Even though nothing was going on between us, he still couldn't let it slide. I used to think his jealousy was proof of his love for me. 



But now, it had turned into a knife, stabbing straight through my heart. ""Freeze all of Delicia's bank accounts! Recover the money paid for her mother's dialysis!"" 


The assistant hesitated over the phone. ""Mr. Gallagher, that money keeps Madam Kearney alive..."" ""Do as I say!"" He roared toward the speaker, ""If she's bold enough to elope with another man, then she can forget about spending my money! Let her sickly mother die!""


 ""Wilfred! If you want revenge, come at me! Leave my mother out of it!"" I flew off the handle, reaching for his phone, shoving at his hand. But my hand passed through the object again and again. I couldn't grasp anything. A wave of helplessness washed over me. All I could do was watch him hang up the phone, his face alight with the satisfaction of revenge. 


""Delicia, this is the consequence of betraying me."" Then he shared a post on Instagram, captioning it: ""A family disgrace."" 


Seeing those clueless friends hurl insults at me while showering him with words of comfort, Annetta smiled, savoring her victory. 


Wilfred summoned his assistant and gestured toward the guards at the door. ""Tell them. ""If Delicia comes back begging, don't listen to her. Throw her out at once!"" I floated behind him. I could only witness as he sentenced my mother to death over a photoshopped picture. 


As he stripped me of all worth with his words.


 Chapter 3 


After work, Wilfred drank himself into oblivion, and Annetta escorted him home. The moment they stepped inside, Daily dashed over.

 Its front paws were already mangled from clawing at the glass door. Then, Daily bit into Wilfred's pant leg, dragging him toward the balcony. With every desperate bark, it tried to draw his attention, hoping he would help its master, who could no longer speak.


 I watched Daily's bloodied paws, my heart breaking into pieces. ""Daily, enough. Don't beg him... Don't beg that monster..."" 


Wilfred staggered from the pull, his eyes burning with wraith. ""Scram! Are you thinking about that bitch again?"" With one merciless kick, he sent Daily flying. 


Daily crashed into the wall, groaning in agony, yet stubbornly fought to stand again. Even my soul was shaking. I rushed over and shielded Daily, shouting at Wilfred, ""Stop! Stop hurting Daily!"" Somehow, the dog reminded Wilfred of me, the woman who ""betrayed"" him. 


He pointed at Daily and hissed, ""Ungrateful dog! Just like your master!"" He didn't want to see the balcony or the rope that I had used to ""escape"".


 Spinning around, he stumbled into the nursery. We had spent six months meticulously arranging and decorating this room. The walls were painted in cerulean blue, adorned with white lamps, shaped like clouds. Toys filled every corner. He casually picked up a tiger toy on the bedside. I said that if it were a boy, he would grow up strong and fierce, like a little tiger.


 Holding me close, he kissed my forehead and whispered, ""Honey, thank you for everything. I'll love our child just the same, whether it's a boy or a girl."" That moment remained vivid in my mind.


 But now, staring at the plush toy, Wilfred thought not of our child but only of that photo of me with my senior at the airport.


 Annetta leaned against the doorframe, a piece of paper clutched in her hand. ""Fred, look what I've found in the trash bin!"" She approached Wilfred and handed the paper to him. It was an abortion request form. The date was a month ago. Obviously, it was forged. 


""Has she already planned to get rid of the baby and run off with someone else? ""This child might not even be yours..."" Those remarks became his last straw. He completely lost his marbles. ""Go to hell!"" He screamed hysterically, overturning the crib in a fit of rage. 


He snatched a pair of scissors and charged at the unopened baby clothes. He cut them into pieces. He tore them apart. ""Stop! They're still new! ""Are you out of your damn mind, Wilfred?"" In the depths of my despair, I watched the scene unfold before my eyes.


 I watched as he cut the socks I had prepared for my baby and the little hat that I had knitted for so long. I sank to my knees, crying my heart out, trying to use my intangible form to stop his rampage. 


But he couldn't see me. ""You don't want the baby, do you? ""You want to abort it, don't you? ""Then none of it stays! Get it all out of my sight!"" 


He brutally drove the scissors into the tiger toy.


 Tufts of cotton swirled through the room. Then its head was severed, tumbling to the ground.


 After lashing out, Wilfred felt hot and out of breath. He marched toward the balcony in big strides. ""Air... I need some fresh air...""


 He reached for the door handle. I was just standing outside. Seeing what he was doing, Daily grew excited and sprinted over to help. 


But its bloody paws stained Wilfred's expensive suit pants. ""So dirty!"" Disgusted, Wilfred yanked his hand back and viciously kicked Daily, forgetting all about opening the window. 


He went into the kitchen to find a stick to beat the dog. A trace of warmth from his touch still lingered on the door handle. 


On the night of Christmas, Wilfred hosted a lavish party at his home. To shame me, he projected that edited ""elopement photo"" on the living room screen and played it on a loop.


 The guests were buzzing about it. ""Honestly, I didn't expect Delicia to be this kind of woman.""

 ""After everything Mr. Gallagher has done, she actually cheated on him?"" Annetta wore my red gown, gliding among the guests like the hostess.


 Suddenly, the door was thrown open. My parents, white-haired, stumbled inside. ""Wilfred! Where is Della? Where is she? ""She didn't pick up our calls. There's no news from the hospital. What have you done to her?"" 


My mother cried her eyes swollen. Wilfred stared at them coldly and sipped his champagne. ""How the hell am I supposed to know? She eloped with another man. Didn't you know that?"" ""Elope?"" My dad trembled with rage. ""The baby is due! How could she possibly run away? Give her back to us!"" 


My parents charged over, trying to grab Wilfred's collar. Wilfred pushed them away and hissed, ""Step back! Don't mess up my clothes!"" 


Old and weak, they lost balance and fell heavily to the ground. My mother's head hit the floor, and a huge lump formed instantly. ""Dad! Mom!"" I screamed, leaping toward them, but my incorporeal body went right through. ""Wilfred! I'm gonna kill you!"" 


I sank to my knees, bellowing at the ruthless man. Just then, Daily broke loose from the ropes and careened out of the storage room. 


Instead of going for Wilfred, it plunged headlong toward the balcony. It banged its body against the thick glass door again and again, desperate to call its master.


 That was the only way it could think of. 


Crimson blood stained the glass. Annetta wrinkled her nose in disdain and kicked Daily away. ""Back off! Stupid dog!"" Daily whipped around and sank its teeth into Annetta's calf.


 ""Ah!"" Annetta shrieked. ""My leg! Fred, help!"" Enraged, Wilfred snatched up a stone figurine from the coffee table. He strode forward and smashed it down onto Daily's spine.


 The cracking of bones echoed in the living room.


 ""No!"" I howled, my voice tinged with despair. Daily let out a wail and slumped to the ground, unable to move again. But its eyes were still locked onto the balcony. 


Wilfred threw the figurine down, seized Daily's hind legs, and dragged it toward the balcony, leaving a trail of blood in its wake. 


""If you're so eager to be with that bitch, I'll let you! ""I'll show everyone how that bitch managed to climb the rope and escape!"" 


He hauled the dying Daily and marched toward the balcony.


 With a cruel and twisted grin, Wilfred gripped the curtains. ""Everyone, watch!"" With a forceful tug, he drew the curtains aside and opened the door to the balcony. 


Bang! A corpse, long stiffened, fell straight into the living room.",1,1769174428.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Nothing moved, not even a bit. It just gurgled and sloshed. I considered actually going to the ER. For what? I’m not sure. Then I remembered I’m a nurse and water in your intestines is in fact not an emergency. I finally said enough and gave up on sleeping and had a cup of coffee (took a risk with this).

The one where we talk daily, text, call, FaceTime, hype each other up and are just there for each other’s big and small life’s milestones.  Only ask that you’re also in the U.S. as it would make potentially meeting up in real life easier. Happy to swap face pics too, so be ok with that. ",1,1769174284.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Our talks were mostly professional like health, fitness, workout, food, office, etc. and sometimes pets and music but i started liking her vibe 

I asked her out for a date and she respectfully told me that she's already in a relationship and I respectfully backed out, we were still talking but mostly over text but a few days ago we both went out on a coffee and this was the first time we were outside the gym walls or behind the phone, we both talked a lot over coffee and talking to her I slowly realised she is probably the most perfect person i could have asked for in my life

When it comes to our likes and dislikes, our values, our ambitions, our career path, our stance on social topics, what we demand from a partner emotionally, physically and as a person almost everything aligns perfectly (not just for me but for both)

She's like a literal twin of mine but it kind of hurts to think that we can't be together...",2,1769174209.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

Made this super simple Jalapeño Cheese Eggs for breakfast today.

Soft, creamy eggs with melted cheese and a gentle jalapeño kick — honestly didn’t expect it to taste this good.

Ingredients:

3–4 eggs

1 tbsp butter

2 tbsp grated cheddar (or any cheese you like)

Fresh jalapeño slices

Salt & black pepper

Chives or herbs (optional)

How I made it:

Melt butter on low heat (important for creamy eggs).

Whisk eggs with a pinch of salt.

Add eggs to the pan and stir slowly.

When eggs are almost set, add cheese.

Top with jalapeño slices and black pepper.

Turn off heat while still slightly soft.

Most people know coffee and red wine can stain teeth, but there are some much less obvious culprits too. 

Common things like balsamic vinegar, curry, and even beets can leave color behind on your enamel over time. Some sports drinks and brightly colored candies are also guilty of this - not just because of the color, but because acidic stuff can actually soften your enamel and make it easier for the pigments to stick. 

If you have dental implants or restorations, it's worth knowing that while the implant itself doesn't stain, resin-based prosthetic teeth can discolor differently than natural enamel does. Zirconia and porcelain don't usually have that issue since they're non-porous. Your [ClearChoice](https://www.clearchoice.com/?utm_source=moderation&utm_reddit=ownedsocial&utm_campaign=clearchoice_ownedsocial_homepage) dental team can tell you what material your restoration is made from if you're not sure.

Kamusta lasa vs sugar?,"Nagta-try ako magbawas ng sugar intake lately, especially sa coffee at homemade desserts, and napansin ko yung Naturals Stevia Zero Calorie Sweetener na gawa from monk fruit and erythritol. What caught my attention is 1:1 daw yung sweetness niya compared sa regular sugar, so mas madali siyang gamitin without doing extra math kapag nagluluto or nagba-bake.

Here’s their official online shop —> https://s.shopee.ph/9AIbJWDmJn

From what I understand, this sweetener is zero-calorie, zero sugar, and zero carbs per serving, kaya madalas siya irecommend for keto, low-carb, or diabetic-friendly diets. Since granulated siya, mas malapit yung texture sa actual sugar compared sa liquid or tablet sweeteners, which makes it more practical for baking and cooking. Pwede rin siyang gamitin sa coffee, tea, smoothies, and even desserts like brownies or cheesecake.

Mukhang plant-based din siya, vegan, non-GMO, and gluten-free, which is a plus for people na may dietary restrictions. Of course, may mga tao na sensitive sa erythritol, so curious din ako kung okay ba siya sa tiyan kapag regular use, especially kung araw-araw ginagamit.

This looks like a good option for those na ayaw tuluyang bitawan ang sweetness pero gusto mag-control ng calories and blood sugar. Curious ako sa actual taste profile niya. May aftertaste ba like other stevia products, or mas malapit siya sa lasa ng sugar?

May naka-try na ba nito long-term? Kamusta siya sa baking and daily coffee use?",1,1769173325.0,u_popparapapoplabkoto,0,1.0,False
1qkq7iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/1qkq7iz/what_its_like_to_live_in_an_area_with_ice/,What it’s like to live in an area with ICE presence and being indigenous,"I (F, 34) live in Michigan and as a border state, ICE has always had a presence. Not too much-but you would see the occasional vehicle. For obvious reasons, ICE makes me a bit nervous as a darker skinned native. Now, I might not be in a large urban area where we have witnessed ICE horrors in the news, but ICE has been seen more and more around where I live.   Many tribes (including mine) put out PSAs regarding ICE. 

Last week there was reports of more ICE coming to our area, so I was a little on guard. I work across the street from a coffee shop so I will run across the street sometimes to grab a drink. Last Friday, I did just that.  While I waiting for my coffee, I looked outside the big window to space out, but instead I just caught the moment two officers tackled a man to the ground. I didn’t get a good look at the officers because it happened so fast and they were being obstructed by a parked car once they were on the ground. In that split second, I had a wash of anxiety come over me. My thought process in 30 seconds of witnessing this went like  “ where are the cop cars? is that ICE? Fuck I left my ID at my work. I’m wearing a ribbon skirt, will this make me a target? Do I wait in the coffee shop until it’s all over or do I risk going outside?”  I desperately looked around for cop cars, and couldn’t get see anything.  I finally did see it was cops and not ICE. (Not that I enjoy cops either) It was a weird experience. When I went back across the street to my job where all my coworkers are white, I thought about how they have the luxury of not feeling in danger when they see something like this. I can’t imagine what it’s like to be in Minneapolis right now as  an indigenous person or any other minorities. This is our reality right now, what a wild time to be alive. Stay safe relatives.

They walked the pirates back to their ship, which was surprisingly close to the ambush point. Feebee allowed them a couple of the feedstock bricks. That way they didn’t leave entirely empty clawed.

 

She then got directions from Kirr to get back to her room and fell into bed.

 

Before she could fall asleep, she got a gentle nudge from the AI.

‘We have an AAR to attend. Standard procedure after an incident. Now.’

‘I wanna sleep.’

‘Later,’ was all Kirr said. The lights came on.

 

She dressed in her service uniform and noted a new merit badge. It was small, smaller than the others and a dull blue colour. Hardly visible. It was square with a diagonal stripe through a crate icon. She touched it and a dialogue opened in her overlays.

*Material Denial Commendation.*

‘Is that it?’

‘No. A line was added to your file in the citation section.’

‘You gonna tell me?’

‘*For effective action in the preservation of strategic assets during hostile incursion.*’

 

‘Wow’

Kirr wasn’t sure if Feebee was impressed or being sarcastic. She let it go.

 

As they left, Feebee asked Kirr, ‘Where’s the After Action Review?’

‘In the rest area.’

 

Feebee was tired but walked straight and tall. She was the boss, had to behave like the boss. The route took her past the armoury.

Peas sat at a bench. In front of her was a rifle, broken down. She was cleaning the parts. Seeing Feebee she jumped up and saluted.

‘I’ll be along to the AAR in a minute. Almost done.’

 

In the rest room, the two coffee boys sat with Sparky. Their cups full and some biscuits were on a plate in the middle. Bench press and Spotter were already back in their corner pressing weights and spotting.

 

Feebee crossed and joined the coffee gang. Peas arrived and sat down. The gym junkies ambled over making the team complete.

Feebee started. “I don’t want this to be long and drawn out.” She looked around, the others nodded.

“We had three objectives. Preserve the Seed-arc. Prevent the pirates from stealing our stuff and neutralise the pirates. And, do it without destroying the ship. Anything else?”

“That’s four.” Sparky smiled as he said it.

Feebee shook her head. “Anyway, we achieved all *four* objectives with no fatalities or injuries. Good job. I want you to think on lessons learnt and send them to me. Any questions before we wrap-up?”

Sparky spoke, “Why did you let them live. It was a risk to safety. We could have easily killed them.”

“They stopped. Killing wasn’t required.”

 

She was about to end the AAR, if you could call it that, but wanted to add more.

“Our use of drones was effective for both recon and shaping. Our fire discipline was excellent. When we needed to shoot, we did so highly effectively. When we exercised stillness and restraint we did so with discipline and precision. Well done team. Dismissed.”

They all stood and saluted her, “Ma’am.”

 

Her schedule popped up. The AI’s way of reminding her she had to earn her keep.

 

16:00 REPORT TO: SSOCOM Engineering.

 

Sparky got up at the same time as Feebee.  As she started walking to Engineering, he was behind her, like a shadow.

She spun round, “What? You following me?”

“Yes, No. I mean Yes, Ma’am. Engineering. I’m there too.”

“Oh. OK. Good.”

 

They walked to Engineering, neither speaking. It was an uneasy quiet. They tried once but both started talking at the same time. Awkward.

 

“We’re here.”

“Yes. Do you know who’s taking this session?”

Sparky laughed, “I am.”

“Oh. OK. Good.”

 

“This is a cyber course. Practical Cyber Security.”

Sparky sat at a terminal; a single cable led from it into the wall.

‘Surely that’s not really, just for show?’

‘Hard to tell.’ Was Kirr’s response.

‘I can hear you.’

It was Sparky and that shocked Feebee. *How was he doing it*.

‘I can also read your thoughts.’

 

Feebee had never felt like this before. Violated. Sullied.

 

‘This is part of today’s lesson.’

It didn’t make Feebee feel any better. *This isn’t fair. If he can do that, can others? Am I an open book?*

‘Good questions. Now stop me. Push back. We'll start with...’

Before he’d even finished she cut across him. ‘I don’t know how.’

 

Sparky smiled, but ignored them, “Ok, let’s try this a different way. Lesson One – Think of your body as a network. Imagine a battle space with attack surfaces. Find the systems, their controls. Find points of interaction.”

Feebee stood up, overwhelmed.

Sparky continued, “Any way an attacker can get at you, interact with you, is an attack surface.”

 

They were alone in the rest room. Everyone else gone. Petulance was replaced with a stubborn resolve.

She sat down, cross legged on the floor and closed her eyes.

 

Thought of inputs came to her, “Do you mean the eleven senses?” she asked Sparky.

“That’s one dimension but others include your nanites, neural links, enhanced reflex loops. Then there’s consciousness and trust. You must think beyond your base senses.”

“How?”

Sparky smiled, “I look at the world differently. I see three broad attack surfaces. Consciousness is one. Then there’s convenience and trust. Think on these and the vulnerabilities they open up.”

 

He paused.

Then continued, “Search within. Find noise.”

 

Feebee remembered the chatter of systems from her early memories. She reached deep down inside, listening.

 

At first, all she heard was her heart hammering. Fast, almost out of control. 

 

Then she started feeling at a lower level, on the smallest of scales.

 

Slowly chatter returned.

 

Not the prattle she’d heard from the ship’s systems and processes. These were short sharp bursts of information. Directional, local. They talked of position, of task status, of error states and vibrated through her bones and muscle.

 

Realisation dawned. *It’s my nanites.*

‘Yes.’ It was Sparky, he’d been listening. She didn’t mind anymore.

 

There were millions of them, each reporting its status, each responding to damage, growth and the environment. Inside Feebee but outside too.

 

It sounded like the buzzing of bees. Old memories told her this. Her nanites were ‘thrashing’ in response to her state.

 

‘Nanites are optimisation machines.’ It was Sparky again. ‘They reduce entropy. Reduce waste. Reduce conflict and redundant effort.’

 

Feebee understood, intuitively but then she began to feel it. She was agitated, hyper-up and mentally scattered. Her nanites were trying to optimise her state. Signals spiked, corrections multiplied and feedback loops that should have dampened, intensified.

 

Kirr then ‘spoke’, her voice distinct from Sparky’s.

‘Remember. Stillness is the only weapon that never misses.’

Feebee then focused on the noise within. Calmed herself. Brought an inner stillness to her state. Her breathing slowed and she found she could read her nanites.

 

Not at an individual level but their intent. 

 

She began to sing to them, and the gentle rhythm of the tune helped her control her beathing; brought peace. Feebee was able to set her tune to a rhythm and tone that resonated with her body, with her bones.

 

Then, without thinking she shifted to a Stylorian sequence that calmed her further, brought calm, induced stillness. The guttural clicks and hisses were elements of their language. Ancient memories were released and made available to her. One saw a man with long white fingers singing on a mountain top. He held back the forces of nature with notes so pure they froze in the air. Another saw angry seas calmed, coaxed by tunes so filled with stillness that they became mirror smooth.

 

*If I remember doing it, then I have done it.* It was a mantra that helped her unravel the complexity of her memories and what was, was not.

 

And as these memories resolved the buzzing from her nanites reduced. Separating into three layers each with its own tone. The layers focused on a different aspect of her being, or so it seemed.

 

She stopped singing and Sparky explained, “Thinking of your nanites in layers is a good framework. Like a hierarchy, each with different objectives. The Body layer heals you without being told. The Pulse layer ‘twitches’ when somethings wrong and The Silent layer waits and listens, doing nothing but can deliver deadly intent.”

 

Kirr explained it differently.

‘Some keep you alive; life continuing. Some keep you safe; life defending. Then there are a few that are life deciding. They wait to be used and must be given permission, never hurry these.’

 

Feebee heard what they said but didn’t really understand.  What she knew was that when she sang, she was able to reach inside. Deep inside and talk to her inner selves. She thought of them as echo-selves. She talked in song, in resonance and connected. Connected to her nanites that sometimes responded through chatter or it’s absence; to a bright echo-self that talked of righteous paths and the moral good. And somethings there was a connection to a dark echo of herself that challenged her natural path.

 

What were they expecting of her?

 

Sparky heard all of this inner monologue and smiled; she was ready.

1qkq4mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qkq4mq/how_to_pursue_without_chasing_why_they_lose/,"How to pursue without chasing, why they lose interest, and making the first move like a PRO","Way too many people confuse genuine interest with desperate energy. You’re told to “be confident” and “just shoot your shot” but what you end up doing is chasing. Constant texting. Over-investing. Trying to “win them over.” It's not just men. Everyone does it. And it kills attraction fast.

This post is your no-BS guide to pursuing without chasing, why people lose interest even when they seemed obsessed at first, and how to make the first move without creeping them out. All backed by psych research, real-world dating data, and deep-dive relationship science. Tired of social media fluff that turns you into a clingy meme. This is the fix.

Let’s clear the biggest misconception: Pursuing = showing interest. Chasing = trying to convince them to like you. Know the difference or suffer.

Here’s what the best science and dating experts actually say:

- **People like what feels like a reward, not what’s handed to them.** According to Dr. Helen Fisher, biological anthropologist with the Kinsey Institute, romantic interest is heavily tied to dopamine — the brain’s “motivation” chemical. You don’t get dopamine from things you already have. You get it when there’s *some* uncertainty. Chasing kills that tension. Pursuing keeps it alive.

- **Attachment styles matter.** The book *Attached* by Amir Levine breaks this down clearly. Anxious people over-pursue. Avoidants pull back. Secure people know how to show interest without projecting neediness. Understanding your attachment style helps you avoid the “love bombing then ghosting” cycle.

- **People lose interest when they feel overwhelmed or “won over” too fast.** A 2016 OkCupid study showed that aggressive messaging (double-texting, early confessions, over-commenting on looks) leads to 70% drop in reply rates. Not because they don’t like you, but because your energy screams insecurity.

So how do you show interest without turning into a simp or a try-hard?

- **Don’t mirror desperation. Mirror investment.** If they text back fast, match that. If they take hours, stop triple texting. Keep the energy mutual. Clinical psychologist Dr. Ramani calls this “reciprocal consistency” — people feel safest when energy isn’t imbalanced.

- **Make the first move with clarity, not pressure.** Instead of “you’re so hot, we should do something sometime,” say “Hey, you seem like someone I’d like to get to know better. Want to grab coffee this week?” Clear, low-stakes, respectful. Studies from Psychology Today show that direct invitations with a stated *intent* had 2x higher success than vague flirty banter.

- **Let go of the outcome.** Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck says people who focus on “growth” over “validation” perform better in dating too. You’re not trying to *win* someone, you’re trying to *connect* with someone. The need to ""get them"" is what makes you chase. Focus on showing up as a whole person.

- **90% of attraction is subconscious cues.** Your tone, pacing, posture, eye contact. The book *What Every BODY Is Saying* by Joe Navarro (FBI body language expert) explains how confident micro movements are more persuasive than words. Being calm and grounded when you speak is more attractive than scripted lines.

- **Don’t fill silence with validation.** Especially in early convo. Let the tension breathe. If they like you, they’ll lean in. Harvard research on interpersonal resonance shows that high self-monitoring (aka over-explaining yourself) actually makes people like you *less*. Communication = 80% vibe, 20% content.

- **Date from easy energy, not strategy.** No one wants to feel like prey. If you’re exhausted trying to keep them interested, they’re not the one. Real attraction flows when you’re still being *you*. Numbers from dating app Hinge revealed that most matches that turn into relationships had 4–6 exchanges per day, not 20+.

When I started feeling better earlier this week, I suggested getting coffee over the weekend. He said it wouldn’t work for him this week because he was very busy, but he didn’t suggest an alternative.

I replied that it was no problem and that he could let me know when things calmed down. I also asked him another question to keep the conversation going. He only replied that he was going through a pretty chaotic time and didn’t answer my question.

Later, I sent a short “good luck <3” message, which he replied to with “thank you <3”. That was three days ago, and since then the conversation has gone quiet.

I haven’t started another conversation because I was disappointed that he didn’t suggest an alternative and I didn’t want to come across as desperate. To me, the ball felt like it was in his court.

I do feel a bit disappointed, because we had a nice online connection and he did take initiative in the beginning. So now I’m wondering: should I put in more effort, or not?

1qkq1qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentSync/comments/1qkq1qk/studying_hard_without_destroying_your_mental/,Studying hard without destroying your mental health,"Intensive studying has a way of slowly taking over your life. At first, it’s “just a busy period.” Then suddenly you’re tired all the time, constantly stressed, and feeling guilty whenever you’re not studying.

I learned the hard way that stress doesn’t make you more productive - it just makes everything heavier. Here are a few habits that helped me study consistently without burning out.

# 1. Stop treating stress like motivation

A little pressure can help, but constant stress kills focus and confidence. When everything feels urgent, nothing gets done well. Creating a rough plan for the week - not a minute-by-minute schedule - helped me feel more in control.

# 2. Study in sprints, not marathons

Long, unbroken study sessions sound impressive, but your brain checks out faster than you think. Shorter sessions with breaks in between work much better.

Even stepping away for 5–10 minutes to stretch, drink water, or look outside helps reset your attention.

# 3. Eat like your brain depends on it (because it does)

Skipping meals or surviving on snacks and coffee made my stress levels way worse. Real food with protein, healthy fats, and slow energy makes studying feel less exhausting.

Sugar and caffeine give quick boosts, but the crash isn’t worth it - especially when you still have hours of studying ahead.

# 4. Move, even when you don’t feel like it

Exercise doesn’t need to be intense to be effective. Walking, light workouts, or stretching can reduce anxiety and clear your head.

Some of my best problem-solving happened *after* moving my body, not while staring at my notes.

# 5. Protect your sleep

Sleep deprivation makes studying harder, not more productive. Poor sleep affects memory, mood, and stress tolerance.

Keeping a regular bedtime, limiting screens at night, and cutting caffeine in the evening helped more than I expected.

# 6. Do something that isn’t “useful”

Rest doesn’t have to be earned. Watching a show, listening to music, cooking, or spending time outside helps your nervous system calm down.

Time in nature especially helps - even short breaks outside can make you feel more balanced.

# 7. Try mindfulness (no, you don’t have to be spiritual)

A few minutes of slow breathing or mindful attention can stop stress from spiraling. It’s not about emptying your mind - it’s about noticing when you’re overwhelmed and giving your brain a pause.",1,1769172899.0,StudentSync,0,1.0,False

1qkpzwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyStorm/comments/1qkpzwn/how_i_manage_stress_while_studying_intensively/,How I manage stress while studying intensively,"Studying for demanding exams or professional qualifications can be brutal, especially if you’re juggling it with work or a busy daily schedule. Stress creeps in fast, and if you ignore it, it doesn’t just affect your grades - it messes with your health, sleep, and motivation too.

I used to think stress was just “part of the process.” Turns out, unmanaged stress makes everything harder. Here are some practical things that actually helped me stay sane while studying hard.

# 1. Structure beats chaos

Stress skyrockets when everything feels out of control. A clear study plan doesn’t mean being rigid - it means knowing *what* you’re doing and *when*.  
Breaking large topics into small, realistic chunks makes studying feel achievable instead of overwhelming.

One thing that helped a lot: **regular breaks**. Short pauses every hour or so keep your brain fresh. Studying non-stop sounds productive, but it usually backfires.

# 2. Don’t underestimate food

Your brain needs fuel. Skipping meals or living on junk food makes concentration worse and stress higher.  
Balanced meals with real nutrients (not just sugar and caffeine) make a noticeable difference, especially during long study days.

Late-night studying is tricky - heavy food can mess with sleep, but studying hungry is just as bad. Simple, easy-to-digest foods work best.

And yes, coffee helps… until it doesn’t. Too much caffeine increases anxiety and ruins sleep, which creates even more stress the next day.

# 3. Move your body

Exercise is one of the most underrated stress relievers. You don’t need to become a gym addict - even walking, stretching, or light workouts help.

Physical activity improves mood, clears your head, and helps you sleep better. Bonus points if it’s social or outdoors - both are great for mental health.

# 4. Sleep is not optional

Lack of sleep turns small problems into big ones. Poor sleep affects memory, mood, focus, and stress levels.

Studying late every night feels productive, but it catches up with you fast. A consistent sleep routine, less caffeine in the evening, and keeping screens out of bed make a huge difference.

# 5. Schedule time to relax (seriously)

Rest isn’t wasted time - it’s recovery. Whether it’s music, a hobby, time with friends, or just doing nothing, stepping away from studying helps your brain reset.

Spending time in nature is especially effective. Even short walks or having plants around your study space can noticeably improve mood.

# 6. Mindfulness actually works

I was skeptical about mindfulness at first, but even a few minutes of focused breathing helps calm racing thoughts. You don’t need anything fancy - just sit, breathe slowly, and bring your attention back when your mind wanders.

It’s simple, free, and surprisingly effective.",1,1769172753.0,StudyStorm,0,1.0,False

He comes to my door and flirts with me and asks when I’m free to go for coffee. I keep telling him “no thank you I am very busy and I do not want to go for coffee with you.”
He makes claims of being a man of god so I can “trust him” but will try to lean into my door way when handing me parcels.
He takes photos of me and not the parcel for proof

I told him I am not interested and he has become quite aggressive with me this past delivery and tells me “why not?”

I have explained I am not interested but he does not “believe me” and says I will change my mind if I think??

He’s clearly double my age and I am very nervous.

I am worried because he knows my address. Evri phone number is awful to navigate past parcels and the website/app is even worse…

1qkpy5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedlnMen/comments/1qkpy5i/why_quitting_tiktok_feels_impossible_the/,Why Quitting TikTok Feels IMPOSSIBLE: The Neuroscience That Actually Works,"okay real talk. i've been researching digital addiction for months now, diving into neuroscience papers, listening to every podcast about dopamine detox, reading books on behavioral psychology. and here's what nobody wants to admit: tiktok isn't designed to be quittable. like literally, the algorithm is engineered by some of the smartest computer scientists to hijack your reward system. that's not conspiracy theory stuff, that's just silicon valley.

i'm not here to shame anyone. i watched my screen time hit 6 hours a day before i even realized what was happening. but here's the thing that changed everything for me, understanding that this isn't a willpower issue. it's a design issue. the app exploits evolutionary biology that kept us alive for millennia. your brain literally cannot tell the difference between a genuinely important notification and some random video about a guy making miniature furniture.

the real problem with tiktok is variable ratio reinforcement, the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. you never know when the next video will be incredible, so you keep swiping. neuroscientist Dr. Anna Lembke explains this perfectly in her book Dopamine Nation. she runs stanford's addiction medicine clinic and basically argues that we're all living in an era of dopamine overload. the book won tons of awards and lembke is literally one of the top addiction researchers in the world. what hit me hard was her explanation of how our brains need pain to feel pleasure, like actual biological pain. when you're constantly stimulating your reward circuits with tiktok, you're basically numbing yourself to real life. insanely good read that made me understand why i felt so flat and unmotivated all the time.

here's what actually works for quitting. first, you need to understand the triggers. dr cal newport talks about this in his podcast deep questions, he's a computer science professor who studies focus and digital minimalism. most people open tiktok during transition moments: waiting for coffee, sitting on the toilet, before bed, when work gets boring. these are predictable. so you need replacement behaviors that are equally easy but less destructive.

i started using an app called one sec which creates a forced pause before opening social media. sounds dumb but it breaks the autopilot behavior. you have to take a breath and it asks if you really want to open the app. that tiny intervention stopped about 60% of my mindless opens.

the other thing that saved me was motion, it's a calendar app but with AI that actually plans your day in realistic chunks. when you have structure and can see what you're supposed to be doing, you're way less likely to fall into tiktok holes. costs money but honestly worth every penny.

there's also this app called BeFreed that turned out to be a solid replacement for mindless scrolling. it's a personalized audio learning platform built by columbia alumni and AI experts from google. basically you can listen to content from books like Dopamine Nation, expert talks, and research about dopamine detox while you commute or work out. you pick the voice, smoky and calm or energetic, whatever keeps you engaged, and adjust how deep you want to go, quick 10 minute summaries or 40 minute deep dives with examples when something really clicks.

what made it stick for me was the customization. you can literally ask their AI coach Freedia what you're struggling with and it'll pull together relevant content. way more engaging than trying to force yourself through a physical book when your attention span is fried. it's like having duolingo for personal growth but actually useful.

but here's the actual secret that nobody talks about. you can't just remove tiktok and leave a void. nature abhors a vacuum and so does your dopamine system. dr andrew huberman, he runs a neuroscience lab at stanford and has this massive podcast, he explains that you need to retrain your dopamine baseline. that means doing hard boring things intentionally. reading physical books. going for walks without your phone. sitting with discomfort.

i picked up atomic habits by james clear during this process. dude sold like 15 million copies for a reason. he breaks down exactly how to build new behaviors using cue, craving, response, reward. the book helped me understand that quitting tiktok wasn't really about tiktok, it was about building systems that made the alternative behaviors easier than opening the app.

the withdrawal is real though. for about two weeks i felt genuinely anxious and bored. couldn't focus on anything. kept reaching for my phone like a phantom limb. this is your dopamine receptors downregulating, basically recalibrating to normal stimulation levels. dr lembke says this happens with any addictive substance or behavior. you just have to ride it out.

one more thing that helped: struthless on youtube. he's an australian artist who makes videos about productivity and creativity without the toxic hustle culture bs. his video on ""the easiest way to change your life"" completely reframed how i thought about behavior change. instead of trying to be perfect, just aim for slightly better than yesterday.

here's what didn't work: deleting and reinstalling the app 47 times. telling myself i'd ""just watch for 5 minutes."" blocking it with screen time but knowing the password. using willpower as my only strategy. shaming myself for relapses. you need actual systems and you need to address the underlying needs the app was meeting, boredom, stress relief, connection, entertainment.

also consider what you're actually afraid of losing. for me it was feeling culturally relevant, like i'd miss out on jokes and trends. but honestly? nobody cares. the world keeps spinning. you can still see the actually important stuff through other channels.

last thing. when you quit, your time doesn't automatically fill with productive stuff. you'll probably just switch to youtube or instagram or whatever. that's fine initially. progress not perfection. but eventually you want to build in friction for ALL infinite scroll apps. make your phone a tool again, not a pacifier.

the people who successfully quit aren't more disciplined than you. they just designed their environment better. they made it harder to fail than to succeed. that's it. that's the whole game.

your brain is plastic, it can rewire. but it takes actual time and conscious effort, usually around 2 to 3 months before new habits feel natural. tiktok trained your brain over months or years. you can't undo that in a weekend. but you can start today, and that's legitimately all that matters.",1,1769172613.0,LockedlnMen,0,1.0,False

In the ever-evolving collaboration between Travis Scott and Jordan Brand, few colorways have achieved the instant, iconic status of the **Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low ""Mocha.""** Officially dubbed the ""**CQ4277-001**,"" this sneaker transcends its simple ""Mocha"" nickname, offering a rich, layered palette that redefined neutral-toned sneakers.

While the ""Reverse Mocha"" and ""Olive"" iterations grab headlines, the original ""Mocha"" is the foundational piece. Its genius lies not in loud branding, but in a sophisticated, wearable color story. The upper is crafted from premium white leather, providing a clean canvas. The signature ""Mocha"" brown then takes center stage on the oversized reversed Swoosh—the hallmark of Scott's AJ1 collaborations—as well as on the heel overlay and the durable suede mudguard. This rich, dark brown is more than just ""brown""; it's a deep, warm hue reminiscent of its coffee namesake, adding immense depth and luxury.

The sneaker's true uniqueness, however, is amplified by its **contrasting accents**. Hits of University Red on the tongue's ""NIKE Air"" tag, the inner liner, and the outsole stitching provide a vibrant ""pop"" that breaks up the earth tones without overwhelming them. The final touch is the dual-language branding on the heel: ""Cactus Jack"" on one side and the Nike Air logo on the other, a subtle nod to the collaborative effort.

Beyond the colorway, the sneaker is packed with **trademark Travis Scott details**. The lateral side panel features a discreet zippered stash pocket, a functional and quirky element beloved by fans. Underfoot, the sole features a mix of the traditional herringbone pattern and solid rubber, finished with the co-branded icy blue outsole.

The Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low ""Mocha"" was more than just a release; it was a cultural moment. It proved that hype could be built on sophistication rather than sheer flashiness. Its versatile, layered ""Mocha"" palette makes it a grail for both sneaker collectors and fashion enthusiasts, cementing its place as one of the most influential and sought-after collaborations in modern sneaker history. It's a low-top legend, defined by the rich, earthy tones that started it all.

First things first, I'm going to go ahead and list some ""rules"" before you get any further since they tend to be what disqualify potential partners the most. All of these are hard requirements, mind you. I know that starting off with a list of requirements saying what you need to be or aren't allowed to do/have isn't exactly the best for attracting people, but it's genuinely intended to save you time since I've had a good few folk before message me telling me that they wish I would have put these at the top. So, here I am, putting them at the top.

* You need to be 18 or older. Preferably 24-34.
* You need to be a cis-gendered woman. Born a girl, still a girl, no plans on being anything but a girl. Not trans. Not nonbinary. Not genderfluid. A girl who is happy being a girl.
* You need to live in the United States.
* You need to have a computer to game on.

That aside, let me just say that I'm only here for romance, not to make platonic friends. I'm flattered if you want to be friends with me, but if that's your only intention, I'm not interested.

Alright. Before I start yapping about a bunch of things, let's go over some good ol' bullet points about myself first.

* I'm 32, male, asexual but heteroromantic, and I live in the USA.
* Agnostic and firmly against Abrahamic religions, but accepting of non-Abrahamic beliefs.
* I don't have children and will never want children. Pets are a maybe.
* I'm 5'11"" and fine dating shorter, equal to, or taller than myself.
* Physically, I'm very dad-coded. What I mean by this is that girls with daddy issues tend to find me attractive. Girls without daddy issues tend to be neutral about my looks.
* I'm asexual, but still open to and can enjoy having sex. I just prefer fiction over the real thing. Still very touchy and physically affectionate, though.
* I like to be boring and predictable. I'm the type of guy who can eat the same food every day, play the same game for hundreds of hours straight, rewatch my favorite anime and movies repeatedly, etc.
* But I do have a ton of interests and a wide variety of interests. Most games I play nowadays are survival crafters, indie games, and ""friendslop"" games, but I also love colony sims, 4x games, co-op shooters, and more. I have watched probably 200 anime series (an amateur number to some, I know) and at least 100 movies. My favorite genres are fantasy, sci-fi, horror, thriller, comedy, and romance. Sci-fi horror is an especially powerful combo for me.
* I also like to cook, bake, ferment my own food, and homebrew my own alcohol. I can make dishes from pretty much any nationality, whether that's American, Mexican, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, or whatever else. I would love to cook for someone, to be cooked for, and to cook together. I also keep a gallon of homemade cold brew coffee in the fridge at all times, so you'll never be without cold brew with me.
* I love to write and read, and am especially fond of text roleplaying. I've even had one of my books professionally published before, and I don't mean via vanity publishers.
* I've DMed TTRPGs before and would love to DM something with my friends plus my (currently non-existent) partner.
* I like to discuss philosophy, ethics, politics, etc, but only with people who can be chill about it.
* And on the note of politics, I'm left by American standards, right by most of the rest of the world's standards. But for a very tl;dr of things, I'm economically progressive but socially conservative.
* I value cleanliness and try my best to keep a clean environment in the home. That being said, I can be pretty lazy about dusting. I'll do all the other cleaning if you do all the dusting. Deal?
* I value and require emotional monogamy, but don't really care about sexual monogamy in a partner. Maybe it's because I'm asexual and don't care about sex in the first place, but as long as I'm the only person you have romantic feelings for, I'm happy.
* I prefer staying inside. And when I say I prefer staying inside, I mean my idea of a romantic date is grinding together in a game for 8 hours instead of going out somewhere. When I say I prefer staying inside, I mean I can easily go months without ever stepping foot outside.
* I'm self-employed. Most weeks, I only need to work about 5 or so hours for the entire week to sustain my quality of living. This leaves me with tons of free time.

Alright. That's that for the bullet point list of random things about myself. Now I can get into the regularly scheduled rambling.

First, since I call myself a hikikomori in the title, I'll ramble about that.

When I was a teen, I was objectively the stereotype of hikikomori. Terribly socially anxious, only went outside a couple times a year and only when I needed to, would feel sick just from the idea of being seen by other people, etc. Now, I'm confident to the point where I'm a narcissist at times, and I'm intentionally hikikomori. I'm educated and self-employed, working from home and only needing to work for 5 hours a week most weeks to sustain my living style. I'm not opposed to going outside and even enjoy nature trails and walking at the beach, but I rarely ever do that and often go weeks without stepping one foot outside since I have no need to. Admittedly, my record for not going outside at all last year was only two months. It's not that much, but I'm sure normies would disagree.

I sit at my computer, every day, for at least 12 hours. Most of that time is spent playing games, browsing the internet, writing/roleplaying, or watching anime / reading manga. I have a bunch of great friends, but they are all strictly online. Only my mom and the government know me offline.

All those ""tests"" always come back positive confirming that I'm a hikikomori, but perhaps not as intensely as others are. I'm hikikomori by choice. I'm happy this way. I tried out change and didn't like it. Ideally, I would like to live in the middle of nowhere where the nearest neighbors are at least a mile away and I can go outside without ever seeing another person. With a partner, of course.

I might be asexual (but with no problem with having sex), but I'm still heteroromantic and very much a hopeless romantic, so that's why I'm here.

But I'm also here because my ideal type of girl would be a NEET/hikikomori or obsessive girlfailure. Yes, I'm fetishizing them, but I also know what it's like to be with them and accept them for who they are. I can fetishize a concept while also being aware of the reality of it and being fine with that. Anyways, I've dated girls who enjoyed going out before and doing all that normie shit, and it wasn't for me. You know what's romantic to me? Spending 8 hours straight grinding in a game together. You know what would make me happy and feel loved? Not getting flowers or being taken out to a nice place, but me spending four hours straight chopping trees in Valheim while you build us a nice cabin to live in using the wood I've collected for you. Note: I'm not *that* crazy about Valheim or anything, but it's the first example that came to mind for the kind of game I love to sink hours into with others.

Asking me to watch anime with you would make me feel nicer than asking to have sex. Sending me a cute anime girl gif on Discord would be cuter to me than handwriting me a letter (though, I would still display the letter on my desk if you did). Being in a voice call rotting in bed together since we're both too lazy to do anything sounds like an infinitely better way to spend a day together than going out on some romantic date. I mean, to me, the bed rotting *is* a superior romantic date in the first place.

Yeah, sometimes, I like going out. Once we live together in the future, if I want to go walk on a nature trail, but you don't want to, that would be 100% okay. I'd just take a bunch of pictures and/or videos to share with you later. I would rather have a girl who never leaves the house and just wants to stay home all day every day than a girl who always wants to go out. And if I have to sedate you and put you in a cage like a cat just to take you to the doctor once a year, so be it.

Ideally, I would have a girl who I can take care of and provide for (even if I can't do that quite yet). But despite this, I'm not looking for some girl who just wants to be taken care of and mooch off some guy who simps for her because she's a girl who gives him attention. I'm pretty picky and have high standards. There is a lot that I want out of a relationship, it's just that everything I want can be provided without ever leaving home.

I don't want kids. I don't want (but might be open to having) pets. I don't want some submissive tradwife who cooks and cleans for me. I want a girl who I own and have control over. A girl who I can treat like a customizable doll. Someone who wants someone else to tell them how to live and what to do to be happy. I might be asexual, but I'm still a dominant person both in and outside of the bedroom the majority of the time. I want a girl who is 50% my equal partner, 50% my doll / pet dog.

I'm not always dominant, and I'm certainly not some smooth and mysterious male lead from a woman's smutty romantasy novel. I can even be, as we used to say back in the day, a ""goofy goober"" at times. I can be silly, act cringe, be stupid, and just mess around. Sometimes, I might even be the one acting like a dog. But in general, I'm dominant and crave submission.

There is just something incredibly romantic and appealing to me about a girl who chooses to submit to me. I don't want a girl I have to force to obey me, who I have to groom, who I have to manipulate or gaslight, who I have to punish, etc. I want a girl who sees me for everything I am and *chooses* me. Like most humans, I want to be wanted. Choosing to submit in body and mind is like the ultimate expression of that to me.

And no, this isn't just a sex thing. Is it true that I would probably buy you a bunch of outfits and cosplays to wear for me, and I may make you dress like a cute anime maid on a regular basis? Yes. Is it because I want to fuck you? No. I just like cute things and want to make you look cute for me.

Aside from that, honestly, you would mostly just be treated like a normal girlfriend and an equal partner. I enjoy cooking, so I would like to cook for you, be cooked for, and to cook together. I have no problem cleaning and splitting that responsibility evenly. Even if I'm the one providing for you and making all the money in our future living situation, I would still do my fair share of things unless you *want* to do it all.

Now for the next part of yapping.

I call myself a yandere since many of the ways that I can express love and feel attached to partners would be considered unhealthy. I'm not some stereotypical stabby jealous yandere who is going to ruin your life if you hurt my feelings. Really, if you ever decide that we're not working out, then I'll just block you on everything in an instant and never think about you again. You'll never have to worry about drama if we don't work out. Tell me you want to break up and I won't even ask why, I'll just immediately block and ghost.

So, how am I yandere then?

I can literally spend 24/7 with a partner who I love and never get tired of them. I will *want* that, even. There is no need for ""space"" with me. I will want to be together 24/7. Now, I know that's not possible. When I was younger, it would be a problem if a girl couldn't do that, but I've matured and am in control of my feelings. Even when it comes to things like getting jealous over stupid things, which I know I do sometimes, I control that, don't show it, and don't let it cause problems nor take it out on my partner.

I just want to be with you 24/7. At the start, there might be times where I go play games with my friends for a few hours. But once we're officially together, I would have no problem dragging you into every single thing I do with my friends, whether we're playing games or watching anime. Everything I do with my friends is in a server I own that you would be a part of, so you would *never* need to be away from me. I would either always be in call with you or in a public group chat you can join in on. I would invite you to play games with us, I would run a TTRPG that I DM that you can be a part of with my friends, etc. I would want to make my friends your friends as well.

But here's where I get a bit yandere. I don't care about your own friends. I don't care about your family. I only care about mine. I want to adopt you into my life. I want a girl who has nothing and I want to give her everything.

Now, you might say, ""Wow, how original. You sound just like every white knight with a savior complex who gets bored of a girl after he has fixed her.""

Hah. Funny. If anything, the problem is that after I've ""fixed"" my exes, they were the ones who moved on from *me*. My longest relationship was for four years. How I treat you in the first three days is how I will still treat you four years into the future. I am safe and predictable. I don't get bored or lose interest if I genuinely love you. But also, I don't want to fix you. I want to make you dependent on me. I want you to not know how to live without me. I want you to do anything for me. I just also want to take care of you, pamper you, shower you in praise, call you a good girl so often you get sick of it, and do my best to make you as happy as possible.

And I want a girl who will want to make me as happy as possible as well.

Anyways.

This yap of a post should be enough proof of my 'tism and how delusional my preferences might be. But I'm not going to hide these things. What's the point in presenting myself as more normal only to reveal who I truly am later and find out that I've been wasting time? If I'm going to try and attract a partner, I'm going to do it by being as unhinged as I can be upfront to scare away as many people as possible. Anyone who makes it through all of that and still chooses to message me if the type of girl I'm looking for, not all the ones who get scared off.

I don't care if you're a NEET or a hikikomori. I don't care if you're some girlfailure femcel who dropped out of high school, never went to college, is in debt, doesn't have a job, lives with her parents in their basement, etc. As long as like everything that you read in this post and the other posts on my profile (which you should seriously read all of before you consider messaging me, my type of the girl is the type who would read every single thing I've ever posted before messaging me), then I'm interested in you. You might think you won't live up to my standards, but just try. Just keep in mind that while this will obviously start off as long-distance, I'll expect to voice chat with you, know what you look like, and we will eventually be living together.

That's all for now. Thanks for reading if you actually read all of this. If you're interested and decide to message me after you read everything else on my profile, just keep in mind that the more you yap about yourself when you message me, the better. After all, if it isn't obvious after reading this, I love yapping.",0,1769172306.0,NEETr4r,1,0.25,False
1qkpt0n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkpt0n,Prep Closet Eval/Input,"Hey everyone, just wanting some input on my “prep closet”. It only takes up a few shelves and I’ve worked for the last few weeks on it. I do not intend for it to get me through a nuclear holocaust. My goal is that if something happened we (gf and I) could live (almost) solely off this closet for 2 weeks without electricity. Not everything is stored in this closet but it mostly is. I also have access to some things within the house. I have a shelving unit in there that’s a game changer. Also on top of these I have 4 vials of Zofran that are 4mg each, hence the injection needles at the end.

Notes relevant to my situation:

\- I live in southern Louisiana where our infrastructure doesn’t handle winter well, summers are hot as hell, and hurricanes happen.

\- Guns: I have a Glock 17 Gen 5 and an AR-15, both have 950+ rounds of ammo in boxes. I’ve had these guns for years with plenty of practice and cleaning. They work well for me. I also have knives of different sizes and utilities

\- I live in an apartment complex with multiple buildings that surround a large, dyed, man-made pond with a fountain. I am planning to also get coffee in quart sized Mylar bags to trade and a months supply of baby formula to be able to help out any newborns that are within the population.

\- I am unsure of how many calories this is. I assume 100k (plus or minus \~ 20k)

\- My girlfriend and I are both nurses and our apartment neighbors are also nurses we work with and are close with

\- I have this document to closely monitor our supply and Best Buy dates so we can rotate as needed",2,1769172217.0,prepping,12,0.75,False
1qkpshj,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qkpshj/housemate_has_no_concept_of_others/,Housemate has no concept of others,"So I live with my girlfriend, her mom, her mom's fiance, his daughter and the daughter's boyfriend.

6 People, 3 sets of 2.

this post is about the fiance. for the sake of simplicity he'll be referred to as X.

X is not a bad person I don't think. he is a very hard worker and is always doing things to fix the house (we had a flood a few years ago and things are still getting fixed).

but X has some tendencies that feel downright insane.

the one that is least impactful is he always speaks at maximum volume. we both we up 5:30-6:00 am on weekdays. but for some reason whenever I whisper hello, or even just wave he always goes ""GOOD MORNING \[NAME\] ARE HAVING A SUPER AMAZING GREAT DAY"" or something along those lines. not yelling but like he's talking to someone across a room full of people. this also happens late at night, when I see him if we get a snack or something at the same time. he has no volume control at all.

the next thing is he's constantly taking up swaths of space everywhere. normally I wouldn't have a problem with a person's stuff being in any given since it has to go somewhere. but for some reason he NEEDS his stuff to go in very specific places even if that place is 5 feet from where it would go otherwise.

the biggest example of this is in the kitchen. he has taken over a corner of the counter space for ""his stuff"" like the coffee maker (no one else drinks coffee) which is fine. what gets me is that he stores cups, and seasoning and vinegar there, when it's only two steps from where all the other seasonings and vinegar is. it literally sits under the cabinet with cups in it. why doesn't he store it with the rest of them.

the second example is with fruit. this will tie into a point later too. he has aquired an INSANE amount of star fruit. like a good 500 star fruit. to the point that there were grocery bags FULL of star fruit. ok, fine, whatever, you can have your star fruit I guess. that was my sentiment until he washed and laid out star fruit on every surface in the kitchen. you couldn't use the counter, there was star fruit EVERYWHERE.

this ties into the fact that he is borderline unhealthy with food. that is not to say he isn't healthy, he exercises and heats lots of healthy foods. but he has not limits to the food he's willing to eat. he refuses to throw away food for ANY reason. stale chips, out of date bread, and the worst one, leftovers from two weeks ago. he just microwaves it and mixes them together. it genuinely makes me a little nauseous just thinking about it. this ties into the star fruit thing because while they were laying out everywhere they were green. then they all slowly turned yellow, the dark yellow, then brown, THEN he started to make smoothies and put them in dishes to eat. like, at that point why do you even have that many in the first place. not to mention he keeps dishes covered in food bits in his room, for days. and he drinks out of cups without washing them for days.

the third-ish problem is he is extremely pedantic and underhanded. imagine i have finished my jug of juice, and I put it not in the kitchen trash, but the bin outside. he will go out pull it out bring it back inside then send a picture to the house group chat talking about how we should be conserving space in the trash cans. if I put something in the trash where it goes and he doesn't like it he'll just take it back out. this 4 year old backpack I just got rid of because of the holes it had worn into it? back on the back patio, twice. it's gotten to the point that he labeled which recycling bins we need to use for each type of recycling. they sort it at the plant. he knows this, and yet he still sends passive aggressive images to the group chat when we put plastic in the one of 3 (there are 4 recycling bins) cardboard bins. he's so bad about it his fiance, my girlfriend's mom literally acknowledges that he does it and just tells us to hide it into the bins to avoid the confrontation (he digs through them by the way, so that doesn't work)

lastly he has some of the worst communication skills I've ever seen. it's hard to describe it but it's like he is never being serious. like you ask him a serious question and he won't answer honestly with an ""I don't know"" he'll make up an answer that is just impossible instead. he is also constantly coming up with little pet names for everyone, it's cringe.

bonus round: he has a serious temper, but doesn't ever confront anyone. we hear X and My girlfriend's mom talking about things he a

has a problem with but he never just says the problem. he once EMAILED my girlfriend about how she was manipulating her mother and was a generally bad person. my girlfriend has clinically diagnosed depression and bipolar disorder, not that he would even know or care what those are.

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

1qkppvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qkppvo/ghosted_dont_think_i_did_anything_wrong/,"Ghosted, don’t think I did anything wrong.","I made friends with a coworker almost 10 years ago. We started off as acquaintances and grew close at the start of Covid and she started referring to me as her “bestie” shortly after lockdown. We took trips together, talked to each other daily, helped with each others kids/pets etc.. the bond was there.

Starting 2 years ago I went back to school. I made it clear from the beginning that my end game was to eventually find a better job and have more marketability in the field we both work in (healthcare) I never hid this fact. It’s always been known I would look for and take a new job away from my friend once I graduated. I didn’t want to quit my job that I had with my friend but after 5 years of working the same schedule and getting a bigger workload with no pay raises of any significance I knew a change was needed. At first I asked my friend and other coworkers if they would be willing to work with me so I could just change my schedule I wanted different days off etc..  the first 2-3 months following graduation my friend said “Yeah sure we can work something out.” I have a voice note of this and my husband heard her say it. Once I passed my boards and was officially graduated and licensed with my new degree I came up with some mock schedules and ideas for change this was about 6 months after graduation. Immediately my friend blew me off and said she didn’t like any of the schedule ideas I had and she wasn’t going to change. Other coworkers also refused. I began a job hunt 6-8 months post graduation.

At month 9 I was offered a job. The pay wasn’t better but they gave me the schedule I wanted and it was a job where I would get exposed to higher complex work and learn more. I really wanted said job so I took it. Immediately my friend told me I was making a mistake, told me my current job was best for my family and lifestyle, and that I was being overly dramatic with needing to change things. I took the job and quietly exited my old employment where I had been for 13 years. Between starting my new job and months 11/12 my friend and I talked a little less because I have 3 kids, a husband, and I had to train at said new job. My friend is a single mom of an adult kid, with a lot less responsibilities than me. I reached out as often as I could and tried to keep the lines of communication open.

My birthday happened in month 12 and the night of my

Birthday my husband took me out for dinner and drinks. 1/2 way through the night my friend started texting that she had a gift for me at work and I needed to pick it up from her that night in person. I had been drinking and over did it. My husband had to bring me home and take care of me. The next morning I woke up and messaged my friend and apologized for not going to get my gift, explained what happened and left it at that with plans to get the gift later on.

Fast forward my friend messaged me upset, I hurt her feelings terribly, how dare I not open her gift and immediately show a reaction. The whole thing was weird and my husband even agreed it was almost like she picked a fight. She brings the gift by my house a few hours after I apologized and leaves it on my porch. I open the gift and it’s a thrifted coffee mug and some hot cocoa mix. A nice gift but nothing over the top. I had gotten her some really nice perfume and had it sent to her home and never got any kind of acknowledgment or even a Thankyou. The next week was her daughter and mines birthdays. I wished her child happy birthday. She ghosted my child.

It’s now been 45 days since we last spoke and she has ghosted me. I messaged her at Xmas and I got a “merry Xmas” text back. That’s it. I’ve sent a few voice notes since with no response. Mutual friends have said she is deeply hurt and I have upset her. We are still connected on socials but she has simply stopped talking.

I am ND and throughly confused. I was always taught that expecting reactions to gifts is rude and having strings attached. I feel she was looking for a reason to end the friendship because I no longer served a purpose for her. I’m feeling very used but also confused. I really don’t feel I was that rude. But maybe I was?

A side note to this is my friend has had a few health setbacks this last year and her memory has suffered quite a bit. When working together I frequently had to go behind her and fix things she forgot or messed up and I had been doing this for awhile. I tried addressing it with her and never got anywhere. On top of this I found out she had been diagnosed as bipolar before I met her and she hid it from me, now she isn’t required to tell me her health issues but my husband and I had suspected she was bipolar for awhile based on behaviors and things she does. She told me casually she was once diagnosed bipolar but quickly told me “That doctor was wrong, I’m not really bipolar.” My friend has insomnia that lasts 6-7 days at a time and she self medicates with various things to cope. I feel like my switching jobs effectively ended our friendship and it wasn’t my intention. My kid runs into her kid all the time and has said that she is rude to her. I see her sister regularly and the vibes are off there as well. Everyone is treating me like I’m a bad boyfriend who broke up with her and I don’t get it.

I’m sad about it but also lost on how to just let go and walk away. How can a person be mad at you for doing exactly what you told them you would do for over a year and following through with my goals/dreams?",1,1769171959.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Choosing Aguadilla and the west coast isn’t about doing less — it’s about doing things better, slower, and closer together.

Here’s why honeymooners fall in love with the west 👇

🌊 The ocean is ALWAYS close

You don’t have to: 
❌ Drive an hour
❌ Sit in traffic
❌ Fight for beach access

On the west coast, the beach is minutes away — sometimes steps from your room. Morning walks, sunset swims, spontaneous beach moments… effortless.

🏝️ Natural, uncrowded beaches

West coast beaches are: ✔️ Easier to access
✔️ More natural
✔️ Less commercial
✔️ Less crowded

That means romantic photos without strangers, no need to Photoshop people out, and real “just us” moments.

🏨 Boutique beachfront hotels > mega resorts

In places like Rincón, Aguada, and Cabo Rojo, you’ll find: 
✨ Small, intimate beachfront hotels
✨ Ocean views from your bed
✨ Quiet mornings + golden sunsets

You won’t need to leave unless you want to explore.

💕 Easy to elevate the romance

The west coast makes it simple to arrange: 
🌸 Welcome decorations in your room
🍽️ Romantic luxury dinners by the beach
👨‍🍳 Private chef experiences
🕯️ Sunset setups made just for two

No stress. No crowds. Just intention.

📸 Picture-perfect without the chaos

Want barefoot walks at sunset?
Quiet mornings with coffee by the water?
Golden-hour photos with no interruptions?

The small-town feel creates an atmosphere that’s cozy, intimate, and deeply romantic.

🌙 Quiet doesn’t mean boring

Yes — it’s peaceful.
But there’s still: ✔️ Amazing food
✔️ Night spots
✔️ Live music
✔️ Sunset bars

You can enjoy the night… and still come back to silence when you want it.


💍 Why the west is better for honeymoons
Less traffic.
Less noise.
More connection.
More moments that actually feel like yours.

When I first moved in I asked if I could hang my tv, I explained I’ve done alot of renovations and painting at my current job, as I work at a homeless shelter with a housing program, & long running renovations in the main building I have been a big part of. I told them I could fix any holes and paint after. They told me I could not. 

My daughter pulled down the tv on herself a few months later, luckily she dodged it and it fell on the coffee table. This freaked me out, and I did end up hanging the tv. 

Fast forward, my neighbour who was my friend is moving out, they have a bigger unit. I talked to the landlord and they were willing to work with me for my budget to get into the bigger place for $240 more than I pay now. I’m very gracious and I’m very excited. 

I patched the hole from the tv and other holes from past tenants, and the walls look perfect. (Better than when I came in.) They of course never noticed. 

As for my unit next door, my old neighbour had lots of animals and had been there for 6 1/2 years. The walls have a lot of ware, understandably. 

I asked the landlord if I could paint the new unit, if I use any colour they would like, and again referenced my experience. They told me no, but could split the cost of “professional painters.” (These walls are absolutely not professionally done in the first place.) 

So now upon visiting my neighbour at my new place, the walls are covered in scuffs and things that would drive me nuts. Could I get in trouble for painting the walls in a colour almost identical? And ofcourse I will be hanging my tv… 

Could I get in big trouble for these things? I’m a very responsible, clean tenant. I’m never loud, I keep my unit in great shape! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",3,1769171800.0,OntarioLandlord,7,0.81,False

So I pushed myself to socialize, to gain friends and to protect myself from the eyes of bullies. With that, na-figure out kong mabilis ako ma-lowbatt as a person. Things were really new to me that time pero nae-enjoy ko.

I enjoy talking to people, and be with people.

More than 10 years have passed, sa loob ng mga taon na ‘yon maraming beses na akong na-lowbatt na hindi ko iniisip bakit. Not until now na adult na ako.

Napansin ng mga ka-work ko na tahimik ako. So iniisp nila if malungkot ba ako? I asked myself, malungkot ba ako? Or lowbatt lang talaga ako? So I told them, lowbatt lang ako. And that’s normal.

Ngayon lang ako na-curious bakit ako na-lowbatt. Sa dinami na ng taon na nangyayari ‘yon. Iniisip ko lang ganun lang naman ang tao. Dahil napapagod tayo. Or maybe because I used to be so quiet kaya mabilis ako maubos. But now—gusto ko magka-idea bakit ako lowbatt, mukhang malungkot, matamlay—ubos.

Naisip ko bigla na may pinagdadaanan ang employees ngayon sa company. Pangit currently ang system sa admin at operations. Sa trabaho ko mismo, wala masydong problema bukod sa AI— bearable pa. Pero sa kada pasok ko na we always talk about the same shits sa company, kung sino ang problema, at sa takot namin sa bosses, na-absorb ko ata siya. Naiuuwi ko pala siya.

Napansin ko rin na simula noong nagka-work ako last year, hindi na ako masyado nagpapakita sa mga friends ko. Mga ka-work nalang lagi kausap. Iba pa rin pala kapag bonding with friends. Wala na akong gala masyado, as in little to none. Naging aggressive ako mag-ipon. As much as possible, hindi ko ginagalaw ang sahod ko, rumaraket ako para may pambayad ng bills at allowance ko. Monday to Friday, nasa corporate ako. Saturday to Sunday, rumaraket ako mula pa noong college. Hindi man madalas, pero occupied ako. Most of my days I think about my career, my savings, and comparing myself to other people same age as me.

Sa araw-araw na naging ganoon ang mundo ko. Feeling ko ‘yon ang dahilan bakit ako na-lowbatt. Hindi ko inalam. Hindi ko chine-check ang sarili ko. Basta lowbatt lang ako. Basta nagkaka-malfunction lang ang utak ko.

Now I’m thinking about having a break. Kahit isang weekend na wala akong raket— to spend money to treat myself. Not worrying about my career, the future, and learn to balance my life. No more aggressiveness. It’s time to remind myself na walang finish line. Walang deadline. Cool ka lang.

Kaya pala nami-miss ko bigla maging 23 years old. Kasi noong time na ‘yon, college student ako na rumaraket tuwing weekends. At ‘yong kinikita ko doon? Nagco-coffee shop ako. May dalang libro. O kaya tamang scroll lang at kunyaring nag-aaral. Nakakabili ako ng mga gadgets at equipments na gusto ko. Masaya ako nung mga panahon na ‘yon. Hindi ganitong pressured sa buhay.

Iyon ang bagay na kaya ko naman gawin lalo ngayon pero tinanggal ko sa sarili ko.

I deprived myself too much.

Nakapag-ibang bansa pa rin naman ako. Upgrade ng equipments. Pero laging nasa utak ko ngayon, again, as mentioned— aggressive savings. Na para bang may deadline. Kaya kahit na nabibigyan ko naman sarili ko, feeling ko deprived pa rin ako. Feeling ko nakakulong pa rin ako. That’s because I deprived myself to meet my friends, to socialize, to feel the ground and grass. For the past months I keep seeing the same environments—our house, my room, my jogging path, my workplace, my way home. All the same things. Kapag nilibre ko ang sarili ko, parang for granted lang, may guilt feeling.

Hays. Kaya pala na-lowbatt ako. Kaya pala naubos ako. That’s because I’m depriving myself to feel and experience things that ignite me, that fuels me, that give me sparks—that make me alive.

Hindi ko alam ang rason bakit ako nalo-lowbatt nung bata-bata pa ako. Pero at least sa nangyari ngayon, alam ko na. May idea na ako.

Sorry sa sarili ko. Sorry for putting you to so much pressure. Ang iniisip ko lang kasi, bading ka eh, pagtanda mo wala kang kasama. Walang mag-aalaga sa’yo, kung hindi ikaw at pera mo lang. Kaya nakakalimutan naman kitang alagaan ngayon. Sana makabawi ako sa’yo.",11,1769171719.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

All I'll say here is.. Good Luck. All I had in mind when I thought this up was ""Damn, grandma got hands"". You are allowed to go to the shop before leaving Snowdonia. Make use of that.

\-------------------------------------------

You awake in Snowdonia the day after calming down Abomasnow, and news comes in early saying that the tunnels are cleared, so you waste absolutely no time and get to Cragmere. The way was pretty straightforward, a relatively short tunnel before reaching Cragmere.

The.. town? Village? Sits atop a plateau, just a handful of stone houses battered by the wind. You waste no time and reach the larger building that is the gym. You inspect it from outside, expecting perhaps a Rock or Ground type challenge but the first thing you see is a greenhouse with a diminutive old woman inside, tending to some plants.

You open the door to the building and call out ""Hello?"" and here a voice calling from the back ""Oh yes please come on in..""

You get into the greenhouse, and the old woman stands up and approaches you ""Oh you're such a young one, what brings you to this old place?""

You start answering but before you can, she cuts you off ""Oh but where are my manners. Can I offer you a coffee? A tea? It's lunchtime, maybe I can make you some food.. Come, come""

You follow her into a small room, fitted as a kitchen and she quickly takes out a big pan

""My name is Margareth. My husband.. He was the gym leader here, years ago. He since passed on and I picked up his role.. I asked the League to eventually move the Gym somewhere else.. I'm not apt with Pokémon battles you know? I'm just an old lady..""

She starts preparing a traditional pasta dish with a creamy mushroom sauce and some sausages, while she recounts old anecdotes about her life. You sit there quietly, listening to the old lady ramble on, it's clear she hasn't had visitors for a while because of the cave in and is eager to chat and pass the time.

After lunch, she sets up an old percolator to prepare some coffee.

""Oh but how rude of me.. What's your name darling? I suppose you're here for the gym badge right? Oh if it was for me I would just give it to you.. But that's not how the league works.. I'm even supposed to give you a challenge but there's nothing here..""

""Listen, why don't you help me with the plants? I got a couple plants to repot. Help me out and I will then battle you for the badge. Would that be ok?""

You help out Margareth with her plants for most of the afternoon, again happily conversing. Finally, it's all done and Margareth agrees to a battle with you.

""Alright, I guess it's time to have our battle.. I only have 3 Pokémon, I can see you have more.. Would you like to do a 3 on 3? I can offer you a bit more money if you do, or so does the league say..""

It is a high-volume call center environment. If you’ve worked in one, you know the vibe: giant TV screens on the wall showing the ""Calls Waiting"" number in bright red, hold music that sounds like distorted jazz from 1995, and people screaming because they forgot their passwords.

Most of my coworkers get incredibly stressed when the queue hits double digits. My manager starts pacing the floor like a nervous chihuahua.

But me? I honestly find it soothing.

There is something about seeing that red number go up that puts me in a state of Zen. I like knowing that 15 people are currently listening to smooth jazz, seething with rage, and they are all waiting on me. It feels like a power move.

The Incident:

Yesterday, we were slammed. The board was bright red. A new hire (20s F) was sitting next to me, literally hyperventilating. She looked at me and asked, ""How are you so calm? Everyone is screaming at us. I feel sick.""

I laughed and told her: ""Don't stress. Look at the board. They need us. We don't need them. Honestly, I think it’s entertaining. The angrier they get, the slower I sip my coffee. It’s like a spectator sport.""

She looked at me like I had three heads. She told me I sounded ""sociopathic"" and that it’s ""cruel"" to enjoy people being frustrated when their tech is broken. She’s been cold to me all day and told another coworker I’m ""heartless"" for not rushing to clear the queue.

The Defense:

I’m not not doing my job. I solve the tickets. I just don't let their lack of planning become my emergency. I treat the queue like a game, and I refuse to panic just because a Sales Bro locked himself out of his email.

1qkpf6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honor/comments/1qkpf6r/want_to_know_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,want to know ultimate perfection of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qkpd5x,https://i.redd.it/66kfwoogd3fg1.jpeg,"Do you prefer fully custom brand visuals, or stock / AI imagery everyone else is using?","I’m genuinely curious where people land on this, especially small business owners 🫧

I work in marketing and design, and for a long time I relied, and still occasionally do, on stock imagery too, Canva, Freepik, the usual places. It’s fast, affordable, and often really well shot.

A moment that shifted my thinking was when I was working for a coffee business, creating digital menus and printed marketing materials. Coffee is a pretty universal visual language, so stock made sense at first. But a few months in, I started noticing the same images appearing again and again, not just across different sites within the same business, but across completely different independent cafés and restaurants.

**One specific photo of coffee beans in particular seemed to be everywhere.** *(The Image* 👆*)*

It’s a beautiful image (which is why it gets used), but it made me realise how quickly brands can blur together through repetition and pattern recognition. When customers see the same visuals over and over, it becomes harder to remember who is who, right? 

Since then, I’ve been thinking a lot about the trade-off between, investing in custom visuals (photography, illustration, bespoke graphics), and using stock or AI-generated imagery because it’s quicker and cheaper

**So I’m curious:**

\- As a business owner, would you rather invest in visuals that are uniquely yours, or stick with stock/AI because it’s “good enough”?

\- Does originality actually matter to you, or is speed/cost the deciding factor?

\- Have you ever noticed competitors using the exact same images as you?
