As interest in health and wellness products continues to surge, it is crucial to evaluate Java Burn’s effectiveness, ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects. This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Java Burn, exploring user experiences, scientific backing, and overall efficacy.

**Understanding Java Burn**

Java Burn is marketed as a revolutionary weight loss solution that works synergistically with coffee to boost metabolism and facilitate fat burning. It is a tasteless, powdered supplement designed to be mixed with coffee. The product is the brainchild of John Barban, a renowned fitness expert and nutritionist. According to Barban, Java Burn leverages the natural properties of coffee and enhances them with scientifically proven ingredients to promote [weight loss](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d).

**Key Ingredients of Java Burn**

The effectiveness of any dietary supplement largely depends on its ingredients. Java Burn boasts a blend of natural, clinically-backed components known for their health benefits. Here are the primary ingredients found in Java Burn:

Green Tea Extract: Rich in antioxidants, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), green tea extract is well-known for its metabolism-boosting properties. Studies suggest that EGCG can enhance fat oxidation and improve metabolic rate, aiding in weight loss.

Chromium: This trace mineral plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity. By stabilizing blood sugar, chromium helps reduce cravings and control appetite, which can contribute to weight loss.

L-Carnitine: An amino acid derivative, L-Carnitine is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This process can help increase fat burning and improve energy levels.

L-Theanine: Found in tea leaves, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without causing drowsiness. When combined with caffeine, it can enhance cognitive function, improve focus, and reduce the jittery effects of caffeine.

Chlorogenic Acid: Present in coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is known for its ability to slow down the absorption of carbohydrates, potentially aiding in weight management and reducing blood sugar spikes.

Vitamin D: This essential vitamin supports bone health, immune function, and has been linked to improved mood. Some studies also suggest a connection between vitamin D deficiency and weight gain, making it a valuable addition to the formula.

**How Does Java Burn Work?**

Java Burn is designed to be taken with coffee, leveraging the natural thermogenic effects of caffeine. When combined with the supplement’s ingredients, coffee’s fat-burning potential is purportedly enhanced. Here’s how Java Burn is believed to work:

Metabolism Boost: The combination of green tea extract, chromium, and caffeine can stimulate thermogenesis, the process by which the body generates heat and burns calories. This can lead to an increased metabolic rate, helping the body burn more fat.

Appetite Suppression: Ingredients like chromium and L-Theanine can help regulate hunger and reduce cravings. By stabilizing blood sugar levels and promoting relaxation, these components may aid in controlling calorie intake.

Enhanced Energy and Focus: The caffeine in coffee, combined with L-Theanine, can provide a balanced boost in energy and mental clarity. This can help users maintain their activity levels and focus throughout the day, supporting their weight loss efforts.

Fat Oxidation: L-Carnitine plays a crucial role in the transportation of fatty acids to be burned for energy. This process, combined with the fat-burning properties of green tea extract and chlorogenic acid, can enhance fat oxidation and contribute to weight loss.

**Benefits of Java Burn**

Java Burn offers several potential benefits, especially when incorporated into a healthy lifestyle. Here are some of the key advantages reported by users and supported by the ingredients’ properties:

Weight Loss: The primary benefit of Java Burn is its potential to aid in weight loss. By boosting metabolism, suppressing appetite, and enhancing fat oxidation, it can help users achieve their weight loss goals.

Increased Energy Levels: The caffeine and L-Carnitine in Java Burn can provide a sustained energy boost, helping users stay active and engaged throughout the day.

Improved Focus and Mental Clarity: The combination of caffeine and L-Theanine can enhance cognitive function, improve focus, and reduce the likelihood of experiencing caffeine-related jitters.

Enhanced Metabolic Health: Ingredients like chromium and chlorogenic acid can help regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, promoting overall metabolic health.

Antioxidant Support: Green tea extract and chlorogenic acid are rich in antioxidants, which can help combat oxidative stress and support overall health.

Caffeine Sensitivity: Individuals sensitive to caffeine may experience jitteriness, increased heart rate, or difficulty sleeping. It is advisable to start with a lower dose and monitor your body’s response.

Digestive Issues: Some users may experience mild digestive discomfort, such as bloating or gas, particularly when starting the supplement. These effects often subside as the body adjusts.

Chlorogenic Acid: Research published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry showed that chlorogenic acid can reduce the absorption of glucose in the gut, potentially aiding in blood sugar management and weight loss.

**Conclusion**

Java Burn appears to be a promising supplement for individuals looking to enhance their weight loss efforts and improve overall metabolic health. The blend of natural, scientifically-backed ingredients offers several potential benefits, including increased metabolism, appetite control, and enhanced energy levels. User reviews are generally positive, with many reporting noticeable improvements in their weight loss journey and overall well-being.

However, it is essential to approach any supplement with caution. While Java Burn may provide significant benefits, it should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to health, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and consultation with healthcare professionals. Individual results may vary, and it is crucial to listen to your body and make informed decisions about your health.

So id like to try getting into tea but I've really only had success being able to drink the Snapple peach tea. I tried about 2 times previously but the 1st attempt didn't last long and the 2nd one the brand i picked up (online) didnt go very well since I wasn't sure what to get. Everything I've tried was either too much of an aftertaste or leaning too bitter- can't deal with the 'zero sugar' or Steevia sweetener. Not much of a coffee drinker either except for a single frap from Starbucks (same reasoning) if that gives any indication of taste preference.

Family likes teas, though they don't drink them often and usually only when sick. They have a few blends (from tea stores) and I like the smell but could never drink them.

I'm extremely sensitive to bitter/bitter leaning flavors (no dark chocolates and such) so I'm not sure which teas would fit. Ive tried basic black tea (in a small teacup) with a TON of sugar but I couldn't get it to a neutral or sweet level I could drink.

The main thing I drink is basic water or Dr Pepper. (Mr Pibb otherwise. Sprite or Mountain Dew if there's nothing else- i dont so those water packets. Most ive done is letting strawberries sit for infusing). I do like cherry (syrup) lemonade, sometimes a basic lemonade, and will drink orange juice but it's not preferred. I like strawberries and watermelon but find that they're often mixed and I'm a bit weary to try some of the pre-made combos (family has an extreme allergy to kiwi so the strawberry ones I've seen are automatically out since i dont want to risk accidentally trigging their allergy).

Any suggestions on mixes or brand flavors to try? Something beginner friendly? +suggestions to make a good iced/cold tea?
(I have not tried milk teas/milk in my previous tea attempts since I'm a bit sensitive to it, but I've swapped from regular milk to a lactose free milk so I'm willing to try any milk tea recipes as well if those are actually sweeter than basic tea)",1,1729824163.0,tea,0,1.0,False

It contains 7 different tiers and offers some examples to clarify what they can look like in real life. Let me know what you all think. I realized that most of my relationships hovered around the Associate/Colleague tier. How about you guys?

1. **Stranger** Definition: Individuals you have never met before or have minimal to no interaction with. Characteristics: No recognition or familiarity; relationships are undefined, with endless possibilities for connection. Examples: A person you pass on the street during your daily commute; someone seated next to you on public transportation; a visitor at a public event you haven't interacted with.
2. **Familiar Faces** Definition: Individuals you encounter regularly in various contexts but do not engage with deeply. Characteristics: Recognition exists; interactions remain casual and surface-level; there’s a sense of comfort in shared spaces. Examples: Neighbors you wave to but rarely speak with; colleagues in your office you see daily but don’t engage with beyond small talk; regular attendees at a local coffee shop who recognize each other but don’t converse.
3. **Associate/Colleague** Definition: Individuals you interact with primarily due to shared environments, such as work, school, or social groups. Characteristics: Relationships are context-dependent and based on convenience; casual interactions often revolve around shared activities or circumstances. Examples: Classmates you see frequently but don’t interact with outside of school assignments; people you sit next to in a recurring training session at work; members of a book club you attend, engaging in discussions but not outside that context.
4. **Acquaintance** Definition: Individuals you know and interact with occasionally, often in social settings, where interactions are voluntary and balance leisure and purpose. Characteristics: Some familiarity; interactions are friendly and can be purposeful or casual; relationships offer a mix of leisure and meaningful engagement. Examples: A workout partner you meet regularly for exercise but don’t share personal details with; a colleague you grab coffee with occasionally for casual chats; someone you engage with during community activities, like volunteering or local events.
5. **Buddy** Definition: Casual friends with whom you share enjoyable activities but may not have deep emotional ties. Characteristics: Focused primarily on having a good time without deep emotional sharing; interactions are often spontaneous and don’t require an overarching purpose. Examples: A friend you hang out with frequently to watch movies or go out to eat; someone you enjoy attending concerts or social events with, without specific plans; a friend you often call to play video games or hang out but don’t discuss personal issues with.
6. **Friend** Definition: Individuals with whom you share a deeper bond characterized by mutual support and understanding. Characteristics: Emotional connection and genuine interest in each other’s lives; regular interaction and meaningful conversations that foster trust and support. Examples: A friend you confide in about personal struggles or achievements; someone you plan regular outings or hangouts with, such as movie nights or road trips; a childhood friend with whom you’ve shared significant life experiences.
7. **Confidant/Soulmate** Definition: The deepest level of connection, characterized by profound trust, intimacy, and emotional support. Characteristics: Unconditional trust and acceptance; you can be your true self without fear of judgment; mutual vulnerability, allowing for deep emotional sharing and support. Examples: A romantic partner who understands your deepest fears, dreams, and insecurities; a lifelong friend who has been by your side through significant life events, offering unwavering support; a mentor who not only guides you professionally but also understands your personal journey and challenges.",1,1729824137.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

**What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a weight loss supplement uniquely designed to integrate with your morning coffee. This approach sets it apart from traditional fat burners. By blending Java Burn into your coffee routine, the supplement aims to enhance metabolism, boost energy levels, and support fat burning throughout the day. This design seeks to offer a practical solution for weight management without requiring significant changes to your daily habits.

**The Science Behind Java Burn**

**Ingredient Analysis**

Java Burn’s effectiveness relies on its combination of natural ingredients, each playing a role in its intended benefits:

1. **Chlorogenic Acid**
   * **Psychological Impact:** Chlorogenic acid, derived from green coffee beans, may influence your body’s metabolism by reducing carbohydrate absorption and enhancing fat metabolism. This can contribute to more stable energy levels, potentially impacting mood and cognitive function positively.
2. **L-Carnitine**
   * **Psychological Impact:** L-Carnitine facilitates the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy conversion. This process can boost physical performance and energy levels, which may positively affect mood and overall psychological well-being by supporting a more active lifestyle.
3. **Green Tea Extract**
   * **Psychological Impact:** Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract may enhance metabolism and promote fat oxidation. The increase in metabolic rate and energy levels can contribute to improved cognitive function and mood stability.
4. **Chromium**
   * **Psychological Impact:** Chromium helps regulate blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings and support balanced energy. Stable blood sugar levels are associated with improved mood and reduced irritability, contributing to overall psychological stability.
5. **Caffeine**
   * **Psychological Impact:** As a well-known stimulant, caffeine boosts metabolic rates and energy expenditure. Its stimulating effects can enhance mental alertness and mood, although excessive intake may lead to jitteriness or anxiety in sensitive individuals.

**Mechanism of Action**

Java Burn is designed to enhance the effects of caffeine in coffee. By combining its ingredients, the supplement aims to:

* **Elevate Metabolic Rates:** Boosting your body’s calorie-burning capacity.
* **Improve Energy Levels:** Supporting an active and engaging lifestyle.
* **Assist in Fat Oxidation:** Facilitating fat breakdown for energy.

This dual benefit not only amplifies the effects of your morning coffee but also supports overall metabolic health, potentially influencing your psychological and emotional state.

**User Reviews and Experiences**

**Positive Feedback** Users often report:

* **Enhanced Energy and Metabolism:** Improved energy levels and more efficient metabolism, contributing to better mood and psychological well-being.
* **Convenience:** The ease of integrating Java Burn into a daily coffee routine is appreciated, making it a manageable addition to their lifestyle.
* **Gradual Weight Loss:** Many users experience gradual weight loss when Java Burn is combined with a balanced diet and exercise, contributing to improved self-esteem and overall mental health.

**Neutral to Negative Feedback** However, some users have experienced:

* **Variable Results:** The supplement’s effectiveness can vary based on individual factors such as metabolism and lifestyle.
* **Minimal Changes:** Individuals who do not maintain a healthy lifestyle may not see significant benefits, which could affect their motivation and psychological outlook.

**Comparing Java Burn to Other Supplements**

**Java Burn vs. Traditional Weight Loss Pills** Traditional weight loss pills often rely on stimulants or synthetic ingredients, while Java Burn uses natural components to enhance coffee’s effects. This natural approach may appeal to those who are cautious about synthetic compounds and are looking for a more integrated solution.

**Java Burn vs. Meal Replacement Shakes** Meal replacement shakes offer a structured method for weight management by providing controlled nutrition. Java Burn, on the other hand, enhances your existing coffee routine and supports weight management through metabolic support. Individuals who prefer integrating supplements into their current habits might find Java Burn more suitable than meal replacement shakes.

**Scientific Support and Research**

**Green Tea Extract and Metabolism** Extensive research supports the benefits of green tea extract in boosting metabolism and supporting cardiovascular health, which can positively influence mood and cognitive function.

**Chlorogenic Acid and Weight Management** Studies indicate that chlorogenic acid can aid in reducing fat absorption and support weight management by influencing carbohydrate metabolism, which can help in maintaining psychological balance by stabilizing energy levels.

**How to Use Java Burn for Optimal Results**

**Dosage and Administration**

* **Mixing Instructions:** Combine one packet of Java Burn with your morning coffee.
* **Consistency:** Incorporate Java Burn into your daily routine for the best results.
* **Dosage:** Adhere to the recommended dosage to avoid potential side effects.

**Complementing Java Burn with a Healthy Lifestyle**

* **Balanced Diet:** Pair Java Burn with a nutritious diet to support overall well-being.
* **Regular Exercise:** Incorporate physical activity to enhance the benefits of Java Burn and support psychological health.

**Potential Side Effects and Safety**

**Safety Profile** Java Burn’s ingredients are generally safe when used as directed. However, potential mild side effects include:

* **Jitteriness:** Due to caffeine content, which can affect mood and anxiety levels.
* **Digestive Discomfort:** In some individuals, which may influence overall comfort and well-being.

**Interactions with Medications** Consult a healthcare provider if you have underlying health conditions or are on medications to ensure Java Burn’s compatibility with your current treatments, and to address any potential psychological or physiological impacts.

I’ve got that work meeting tomorrow morning with the boss and some fellow coworkers where I’ll most likely be totally irrelevant? Better have a few to take the edge off.

Put two liters of water in two separate bottles on the nightstand cause I know I’ll constantly wake up feeling dehydrated and take a few chugs and go back to sleep. Then have to wake up and hit the bathroom and chug water while I calculate in my head how many drinks I had compared to how much water I had, and what time I went to sleep. Wake up and chug water sweating and feeling dehydrated and do that a few more times.

So when I’m half asleep, through terrible sleep if it can even be called sleep, I’m constantly thinking about how much I drank, how much water I drank that day, how much water I’m drinking throughout the night, and what time I went to sleep to get this terrible sleep anyways.

So then I wake up feeling “ok the hangover isn’t that bad” and make coffee, keep slamming water, and about 20 minutes into it the hangover and hangxiety hit hard.

All the anxiety was caused by myself, I’m literally paying money to have horrible sleep, feel like shit, and have terrible anxiety in the morning. And get fat as fuck, people pay so much money for ridiculous fad diets and I’m paying $25 a day to feel shitty, get anxiety and get fat as fuck.

I have a boiler that the transformer relay clicks like a MF.  Video attached.

[https://youtube.com/shorts/g5jCS0qxhP4?si=rS6H1iZ4LYsp2HV\_](https://youtube.com/shorts/g5jCS0qxhP4?si=rS6H1iZ4LYsp2HV_)

Long story is my wife bought a nest thermostat about 8 years ago.  Didnt have a c wire so I just put the project on the back burner like many get put.  Well, early this summer I got around to running a c wire from my ac transformer to the thermostat, got the nest installed and all was good.

Two separate systems.  Central air, and baseboard heat (2 wires for heat).

Occasionally over the summer I would come home from work and noticed that the air handler was running but the compressor unit outside was not.  I thought the nest was being silly, would pull it off the wall, put it back on, and it would reset and be fine.  Until one day I pulled it off the wall and it didn't reset.  Only way to get the air handler to turn off was to disconnect the green fan wire from the base.  And it started working fine again.

Fast forward to the end of august.  Im making coffee on a saturday morning, the ac is pumping cold and all of a sudden I hear this crazy clicking from the basement coming from the heater.  WTF.  I flick the boiler switch and it shuts off.  The only way to get it to stop doing this is to disconnect the R wire on the back of the thermostat. So I do some research and find out that the back of the nests are junk and short out.

Throw it out, get an eco bee, run the ac the rest of the summer and now I'm here in a cold house trying to figure out the head.

When I turn the heater on sometimes it just buzzes straight, sometiems buzzes for a few seconds, then stops, then starts.  Eventually it lights.  Once the system is warm it lights no problem and there is no crazy buzzing.

I checked for 120v at the back of the transformer.  Good.  So I figured the relay was bad.  Ordered relay and transformer assembly same thing.

I check to make sure im getting 24v out of the relay.  Good.

\-If i unplug the wires going to the gas coil valve things, same thing

\-If i unplug the probe wire it does the same thing

\-If i jump the temp switch thing (that reads the water temp to turn the burner off) it does the same thing

\-it is 100% the relay on the transformer bracket making the noise and clicking

If I unplug the red and blue wire from the bottom of the ignition box I get one solid click like I got for the last ten years but it obviously doesn't light.  So I think the ignition box is bad.  Order a used one, does the same exact thing.  No different at all.

I don't know what to do. I build race cars, rewire boats, put bathrooms in from scratch, run sub panel to detached garage, understand wiring diagrams ok.  But I need help.

I dont really see how a bad nest backing plate would cause something in the heater to take a shit (heat worked fine when i tested when installing the nest in June), but I also dont see how it randomly took a crap when the nest called for it when the ac was running.

*Meet Me in the Middle* is a 65,000-word YA LGBT contemporary novel with elements of magical realism. *Orlando* with a genderfluid twist, this novel will appeal to fans of the delayed self-realization of Becky Albertalli’s *Imogen, Obviously* and the reality-defying romance of Dustin Thao’s *When Haru Was Here*.

According to his friends and especially his bullies, 18-year-old Tallahassee “Tali” Miller has always been in touch with his feminine side. Thus, Tali is more curious than disturbed after waking up as a girl. Even his dad acts like this has always been the case. At school, the impossible happens. Gui, a longtime crush and typically stoic giant, bashfully asks Tali on a date.

As Tali begins shifting between boy and girl versions every morning, other’s memories adjust to fit his current gender. Tali feels like himself in either body. Navigating how others change their behavior provides the real challenge. After Gui’s distorted romantic confession, Tali fears he wants nothing to do with his original self. Instead, Gui confronts his repressed demisexuality.

Not everything proves so easily rationalized. When people start to question reality, the world glitches. Chickens transforming into emus is only the beginning. Tali must blur the line between boy and girl before the world turns into a surrealist nightmare. This will be difficult when his boyfriend wants to hold hands one day and cower in his closet the next. Worse, Tali has been talked into replacing Juliet at the last minute, and this year’s Romeo treats women like trophies.

Abandoning the school play would eliminate the biggest risk. But having come out once already, Tali refuses to silence his evolving identity by playing it safe.

This novel draws heavily from my experiences as an agender person raised in rural Illinois.

  
A couple logistical questions:

1. Genre - I feel 90% confident in this being contemporary and not fantasy because the focus is on the everyday events, but let me know if I should reconsider

2. I picked out When Haru Was Here as a comp and then started reading and realized the protagonist is 19, so I guess it's technically New Adult? But I imagine a story about the last semester of high school and the period right after has audience overlap. Should I find something else or am I overthinking this?

  
First 300 words:

I woke up in the wrong body this morning.

Scratch that. I woke up in a different body this morning.

Somehow, I’m only realizing now, half-awake and standing over the toilet. And, no, not for the obvious reason. As I reached down to go about my business, a woolen barrier blocked my access. Pajama bottoms. Never in my life have I owned pajamas.

Stranger still, I’m wearing a plain black tee. For me, shirts exist as an annoying social obligation. Unless we have guests, I toss mine in the hamper immediately after school.

I pull my waistband to brave a peek, needing visual confirmation of what I can clearly feel. Yep. I have lady parts now.

Though my anatomy has defied all known laws of science, I’m more distressed by my delay in recognizing these changes. I obliviously scrolled through a gaming forum for fifteen minutes before dragging myself out of bed. My jokes about needing coffee to function carry a sliver of truth.

Relief surges through me as I study myself in the mirror. Flat-chested! Or rather, not any bigger than my somewhat chubby norm. Turning into a girl does not scare me. My friends and especially my bullies insist I’m in touch with my feminine side. But a small chest means I can pass as myself while figuring out why this has happened.

I made a girlish boy and now a boyish girl. Other than my missing stubble and what hides beneath my clothes, nothing meaningful has changed.

1gbk3d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gbk3d1/the_night_i_met_a_time_traveler/,The Night I Met a Time Traveler,"It was a rainy Friday evening, and I found myself at my favorite coffee shop, trying to escape the dreariness of the world outside. The warm light and the smell of coffee wrapped around me like a blanket. I was engrossed in my book when the door swung open, and a chill swept through the place.

In walked a man who looked completely out of place. He wore a long, tattered trench coat, his hair wild and unkempt. His eyes seemed to hold a darkness that made my skin crawl. He caught my gaze and smiled—a wide, unsettling grin that sent a shiver down my spine. It was like he knew something I didn’t.

After ordering a drink, he took the seat next to mine. I tried to ignore him and focus on my book, but I could feel his eyes on me. Finally, he leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. “You know, this café is a hotspot for time travelers.”

I chuckled nervously, thinking he was just a quirky guy. “Time travelers? Seriously?”

He didn’t laugh. Instead, he nodded gravely, scanning the room. “You just have to know how to spot them. Like her.” He gestured toward a woman in the corner, dressed in a flapper-style dress that looked straight out of the 1920s. She was tapping her foot, lost in a rhythm that didn’t belong in this time.

I glanced over, a sense of unease creeping in. “What about you?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light. “You from the future?”

He leaned even closer, his breath cold against my ear. “Let’s just say I’ve seen things that would make you question everything. But I’m here for a reason.” He looked at his watch—an ancient, ticking piece that seemed to echo in the silence of the café. “I have to warn you. I don’t have much time left.”

My heart raced. “Warn me about what?”

“People don’t realize how precious time is until it’s too late. There are forces at work here, unseen and powerful.” He straightened up, eyes darting to the door. “You need to be careful.”

Suddenly, he stood up, adjusting his coat like he was preparing for a storm. “Remember: every moment counts.” He shot me a final, haunting smile and stepped out into the rain.

I sat there, frozen. Was he serious? Was he really a time traveler, or just a madman? I could feel the weight of his words settling in my chest. I looked at the woman in the corner, and she caught my eye, her expression blank and eerie.

The next morning, I woke up to a world that felt different. My phone buzzed with notifications—everyone I knew was talking about the mysterious disappearances happening in the city. People had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only confusion and fear.

And that’s when it hit me. What if he was right? What if time really was slipping away, and I was next? Now, every time I sip coffee at that café, I look over my shoulder, half-expecting to see him again, warning me to cherish every second before it’s too late.",2,1729823758.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I was medicated for anxiety around 6-7 years ago for 2 years and ever since, I have felt like I don’t react or don’t have natural emotion. I think about my reaction and how to react rather than just simply react. I sometimes feel like I live in a 3rd pov or as if I were playing a video game and controlling my character. 

I also cannot learn new things to save my life. It takes so much for me to learn. I can sit and study if I force myself but the information will not stick. I wasn’t the brightest in school but hahaaaa when it comes to problem solving i am there and on it. I am literally the person in the office/job that everyone goes to when they have a problem or want to improve something. (Also in the family) 

I wouldn’t say I have focus issues but yes I do get easily distracted but I will circle back soon. 

Anyways, it’s so embarrassing I can’t remember what I ate yesterday, what I did at work this past week or even the beginning of an article. I am so so so slow at reading and I’m lucky if I don’t have to read something twice. Also I would pass away without autocorrect I can’t spell the simplest words and someee days I will look at words when I read something and it just won’t click. I just can’t make the word out sometimes.

I get headaches everyday, whether i do or don’t have coffee, water, enough food, enough movement/exercise. 

I have no insurance and would love to just either be told if I neeeeed to see someone or if this is just normal/common. ",4,1729823383.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Most of the time I feel like they don't even kick in at all. Then other days, I maybe get an hour or a few if I'm lucky. Sometimes I will get a burst of concentration energy in the evening. 

For those of you who have dialed in a routine or have found something that works for you, I’d really appreciate hearing your best tips! Anything that helps you stay focused or makes your meds more effective would be amazing to know about.

I'm also a woman with PMDD. As you know, research is now showing that there's less efficacy of psychostimulants during this time. Felt important to share as I would also love tips catered towards this if available!

All I really want is a group of people to hang out with on the weekends or before work, like grabbing coffee or seeing the landmarks. If we become friends? Great!

DO NOT USE UBER FOR GROCERIES! ,"You know what, shame on me. This is the 3rd time now. I’ve used Uber for groceries 3 times total now. All 3 times without fail. I’ve been let down miserably. 

First time… I try it out. I ordered the weeks groceries from work and was hoping to get home to all my groceries on my door step. First off they took over and hour to grab 12 items and drive them 15 minutes from the grocery store to my doorstep. So I was waiting for them to get stuff to my door step anyways…. It probably would have been faster to just do it myself….. Second, every breakfast item I had placed on the order got completely messed up …. I ordered bagels and cream cheese, cold brew and oats. Get this …. I get pre-ground coffee as a replacement for a 1L jug of cold brewed coffee. What a slap in the face ….. I also get a loaf of bread and some weird cheese dip as the other replacements …. Excuse me what the heck?!

Order 2: now I am just being petty to be honest. I order those same 3 items again. Stok Cold Brew, Philly cream cheese and a bagel. This time coffee is in stock. Cream cheese and bagels get completely take off the order. So I payed like 15$ for a 4$ jug of coffee….. wooow 

Order 3: I recently got into a car accident so I’ve been without car for a while and unable to really walk/take public transport. I figured I would try Uber again to help me out. Wow …. What a mistake. I was sitting on the app…. Half my items needed replacements and I was sitting there on the app saying “no those replacement are unacceptable, get something else”. Like hummus. I went through this cycle like 4 times. A replacement came up and I picked 4 different brand/flavors of hummus and this jerk shopper just keeps picking some garlic dip… LIKE WTH!!!!! I DONT WANT THAT!!! It’s going in the garbage now!!!! Again, cold coffee was out of stock, at least they didn’t force me to accept pre-ground coffee grounds this time 😑 … Also ordered a bunch of other things that I would have rather they just removed from the order but they kept forcing my replacement to be some shitty thing that isn’t even the same type of product 😓

This app is GARBAGE. 

Guess what…. Ubers customer service says if I would like I can change the tip amount to reflect the shoppers service….. this … 3 times in a row was Ubers solution … punish the shopper and take zero responsibility….

I really wish Uber would hold the stores responsible for doing a garbage job with their inventory…. And that when your order gets really messed up, their dumb services charges get dropped…. They are ravenous to steal every penny possible out of your wallet though. Stop using them… forever. ",3,1729823101.0,UberEATS,2,1.0,False

i (22f) started my first “big girl job” in february at an early childhood education center. i work monday-friday 8am-5pm every day and a 30-40+ minute commute both ways. it can be stressful but i love my job and i love the kids, i don’t want to quit, this has been a dream of mine my entire life but jfc i am just so TIRED.

i wake up at 6:30am, feed my cat, get ready, make coffee and small breakfast that i will eat in the car, leave my house by 7:10am to get to work by 8am (sometimes i’m STILL late and penalized just because traffic is unpredictable bad even using maps to find the best route), work until 5pm, arrive home around 5:40pm-6pm. make dinner which is done by like 7pm-7:30pm depending how much time i take to relax. if i want to get 8 hours of sleep i need to go to bed by like 10:30pm which gives me 3 1/2 hours of free time a night. which doesn’t include any chores or errands i may have to do. i’ve been staying up later, but the lack of sleep has been adding up and making me even more exhausted. 

its like never have time to do anything and even when its the weekend im so exhausted from the work week that id rather just not. i dont get summers off, i dont have much PTO (not allowed to take unpaid time off), and we get off the occasional federal holiday and weekends. i know that this is how basically every single adult job is and i just need to suck it up but HOW?? where do you get the energy to do anything? i’m happy with my job but i feel like im becoming unhappy in every other aspect of my life. does anyone have any advice on how to come back from feeling like this?",3,1729822693.0,Teachers,2,1.0,False
1gbjrdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1gbjrdb/careless_employees/,Careless employees,"Hey espressoheads!

For some background: I am a professional barista (10yr experience and certified). I have been managing a high traffic coffee shop just outside a cruise port for 5yr and have been hiring and training my baristas since the beginning. My health recently forced me to take over a year off of working to kick cancers a*s, so I’m slowly trying to get back into a regular life, starting with a part time barista position at a company I worked at a few years ago. I only left this job due to boredom and a need for benefits, which is impossible to get through an employer, in my area. 

I started back at this coffee shop a month ago and have cringed every shift. They have a wonderful espresso machine ( Nuova SImonelli Wave ) and grinder, the owners keep it well maintained with the work of our roasters. But, this machine is looks 10x older than it is. In the time I was gone, they’ve had years of people not purging the wands, not tamping the espresso, not properly cleaning, I can go on. I expressed my concern to the owners and they have scheduled for me to meet with the roasters to ensure I’m content with the maintenance they provide.
Here’s my issue, I don’t like to work with other people behind the bar, so I only take shifts that allow me to comfortably work alone. In some shift change overlap, I have had to physically stop other employees in their tracks, and guide them through doing things properly. For example, one barista filled the pitcher with whole milk, put the steam wand alllll the way in, until it was against the pitcher side, then placed the setup on the drain grates, started the steaming and tried to walk away. So ya know…. It’s screeching, my ears are bleeding. I stopped the steaming soooo fast, and gently showed the barista how to steam properly. She giggled, said “oh”, rolled her eyes and that was that. Next day I walk in, she’s working, milk is screeching. 
Another example, this company has been using a distributor, and no tamper. When I educated the owners on the importance of properly tamped espresso, they were surprised as they had no idea, and asked me to let the barista group chat know of the same information. I did so, got no responses, and have come in each day (mid shift) to no tamper being out, and the ground dump being full of obviously untamped burnt espresso grounds. 

I understand that these people do not know of the importance of these things to the production of proper espresso drinks, and they do not know how deeply my knowledge runs, but I am so frustrated with this. I do not want to work at a place that serves hot water and milk. I do not want to work with people that disregard everything I say. And, I do not want to see this machine go through this abuse. I’ve been sure to communicate with the owners of these issues, in which they said “the baristas obviously need retrained”. I have offered to do the training, as long as it is one on one with each person, and that I’m properly compensated for it. 

I need some recommendations on how to get through to these people. How do I get them to have a heart? I have a burning passion for what I do, and you have to have at least a little care in this industry. ",2,1729822650.0,barista,1,1.0,False
1gbjqpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gbjqpc/best_friend_changed_plans_last_minute_and_now_im/,"Best friend changed plans last minute, and now I’m suspicious. ","
Whenever I’m overthinking, I come here for advice. So, my best friend and I are currently on a 3-day vacation. We made all the plans together and everything was going smoothly. I told her beforehand that I’d pick her up from the train station, and we’d go straight to the Airbnb where we’re staying.

This morning, I picked her up as promised. When we greeted, she asked, “What are our plans for today?” I said we’d check into the Airbnb and then head out to another spot we had planned to hang out at. That’s when she tells me she can’t make it to that location because she told her coworker that she would meet her daughter, who lives in [dash] place, for dinner. I was confused and asked why she didn’t mention this before because I could’ve adjusted my own schedule for the day. Plus, if she had planned on meeting someone, she should’ve told me ahead of time and I wouldn’t have booked the Airbnb for 3 days—I would’ve just booked for 2 and gone home earlier.

I asked why she didn’t tell me sooner, and she said her coworker just mentioned it yesterday. I then suggested she cancel her plans and stick to ours because this is our time together. I even said she could just make up a reason like missing her bus or something, but she insisted she’s bad at saying no to people, which feels off to me because she’s never had trouble saying no to people before.

We checked into the Airbnb, grabbed coffee, and then she left for the train station to go to her coworker’s daughter’s place. Now, I’m just sitting alone at the Airbnb for the rest of the evening.

My initial thought is that she’s lying. It feels like she’s meeting someone she doesn’t want me to know about, especially since she didn’t invite me to the dinner and the last-minute change of plans feels really suspicious.

What do you think?

1gbjonu,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1gbjonu/messy_friendship_breakup/,Messy friendship break-up,"I lost my best friend of 8 years. I’m a senior in high school now, and I met her in middle school. She was, quite literally, my everything. I genuinely loved her, and I really thought we’d be friends forever. Our friendship wasn’t typical—it was different. We were incredibly close, did everything together, and never fought. There was never a dull moment between us.

She had a tough home life, so I did my best to include her in everything. I took her to family dinners, birthdays, and switched my schedule around just to have classes with her. I even skipped classes that I didn’t have with her, just to hang out. When she had panic attacks, I helped her through them. When she had concerns about her body or eating habits, I gave her advice on taking care of herself. (For context, She’d often compare herself to me because I played sports, exercised five days a week, and ate well. It was a big part of our friendship—I’d have to uplift her almost daily, which I understood, everyone has insecurities.) I also had a little more money than her—not a crazy amount, but my mom and I could afford to go shopping or get our nails done on weekends. Most of my closet consists of expensive brands. Her mother, on the other hand, would never go out and practically refused to buy her new clothes, even though she’d been wearing the same clothes from elementary to high school. She’d use her own savings to buy from places like Temu or Shein but still felt bad because she couldn’t have the kind of clothes I had.

Whenever she came over (which was almost every weekend, every break, and sometimes for weeks in the summer), I’d cook for her and try to make it an enjoyable experience. My mom and I aren’t rich by any means—my mom works two jobs as a single parent to support us. But she’s generous. Whenever we went out, my friend never paid for a thing. We went to the beach every week during the summer, out to eat, shopping—you name it—and she didn’t pay a dime.

This summer, I got my first job and my driver’s license. I was looking to buy a car, so I often called my friend to talk about my options. She expressed jealousy, especially about the car, telling me how lucky I was. I tried to explain that I had my own problems. I just didn’t share them with her. I guess she saw my life as perfect and assumed I never struggled. When I got my job, that was another big issue. For months, she complained that we didn’t hang out anymore because I worked weekends, and she could only see me at school. I rearranged my schedule to have almost all my classes and lunch with her, but she still complained. I talk to my mom about it and she generously offered to let her work with me at my job so we could ride together. I helped her apply, prepared her for her interview, and she got it. I gave her a job, essentially. But after a couple of days working together, things fell apart. One day, we were rushing to get ready, and I told her we needed to hurry, and she started stressing out, eventually telling us to leave without her. She left without saying goodbye, texting me, “I’m sorry.” My mom was mad, justifiably, at how disrespectful it was. At work, she was distant, and when I asked if she was mad at me, she said she wasn’t—just disappointed that I stood my ground and told her that she and my mom deserved an apology. She texted me a rant about how she never felt appreciated in our friendship and always put in more effort than I did. She said she felt we should distance ourselves. I cried, apologized, but told her I’d stay away if that’s what she wanted. No response. Over time, I realized that what my friend did was toxic, I’m better off without her. But I still miss her. I miss laughing with her and having someone to connect with. The truth is, I abandoned all my other friends for her—I even switched schools to be with her. Now, I’m lonely.

My mom has always been my best friend, and I love that I’ve grown closer to her since I don’t have many other people to talk to. I have two good friends at work who I stay close to. They may not be forever friends, but they’re nice, and I laugh with them. I don’t have anyone at school to talk to, but that’s okay. I’ve always been an extreme introvert, so I’m comfortable being alone. I love my quiet time—getting coffee, listening to my favorite music, and reading. I’m not as busy with her anymore, worrying about whether she thinks I’m mad if I’m quiet.

At school and work, I don’t speak to her, but I’ve noticed she’s different. There was one day at work, we talked the whole day, and I realized she’s not the same person I once knew. She’s friendlier, laughs louder, and hangs out with people we used to talk shit about. She’s become close with girls she used to tell me she hated. It’s like everyone is suddenly her friend.

I’m about to graduate, and once I move on from my job, I’ll never have to see her again. I’ll be in college and meet new friends. I can’t help but think about the plans we had—moving into an apartment together, going out, and doing all the things we dreamed of—but it’s fine. I’m ok. I’m not depressed or anything like that. I still go out with my mom and live my life. I like my quiet life, and there’s nothing wrong with it. Of course, I miss her. I want to talk to her like we used to, but I can’t because she’s not the same, and I honestly don’t like her anymore. In fact, I hate her. But it still sucks.

I guess I just needed to rant and get some advice. I don’t even know what kind of advice, but maybe just your thoughts on the situation? Sorry if this is a waste of your time. I just needed to talk.

Hey there,

I intentionally made the title straightforward, I’m currently looking for a healthy companionship now because I’m not sure if I’m ready to be in a relationship as of now but I’m open to the idea of it. I have fairly decent life, work’s pretty decent, friends are great, I have healthy relationships with my family, but I just don’t have anyone to connect with on a deeper level. I’m looking for someone to unwind and let go of all the pressures of the world and be the real me with. 

I mean wouldn’t it be nice to be the real you with someone where you don’t feel judged or schooled or something. Someone to live in the moment with and just enjoy life and be happy? I want that. 

I wanna hangout with someone where we support eachother emotionally, be each other’s accountability partner, help eachother from drifting off from sanity haha. I am a very outgoing person, I explore the city on weekends, I’d wanna explore with someone like minded where we can truely compliment eachother with our aura. I wanna hold hands and go for long walks and do stupid things and make some memories. 

Maybe I’m just too lonely these days? I don’t know. 

I’m looking for someone, nice, someone who’s single and moved on from any previous relationships, someone who’s in the right headspace to invest their time and energy, and hopefully someone who’s lives in Bangalore. I don’t mind your past, your present or future I want this to be a non judgemental connection where we can truely be genuine. I hope you’re from the age group 24 - 30, if you want something more someday, something final.

So I’m a southie, little dusky guy with messy hair, and I’m rocking a well groomed beard. Just like every other human being I enjoy binging shows, listening to music, gaming, anime, and what not. Currently I’m an elden ring player, obsessed with it. I’m a huge fan of horror and fantasy genre. I enjoy rap music, be it English or punjabi, or even hanumankind. I love sci-fi, and thought provoking content, anything that makes my mind busy. I’m a huge coffee lover (but I don’t drink excessively). I’m into spirituality and mindfulness, this year I’ve taken that seriously and it has done wonders to my life, so it goes without saying it would be amazing if you’re into it too. As for my height I’m 186cm, so that would be 6ft and 1in I guess anyways. So let’s get to know eachother more as we interact so I’m stopping my self intro here. 

If you think what I’ve said here resonates with you then hit me up. I’m on the chat waiting for like minded souls hoping something great will happen this time.

When I was home I was retouching with a lot of people seeing how many people I knew still around this friend was one of those people. I went to his house to chill we played gta, smoked, and shot the shit. Eventually he began to say some weird things like that he's been being followed by someone or a group. I legit thought he was becoming a ""gangstalking"" mental crisis archetype. I just went along and listened. Went home it slipped my head.


Well... later my friend asked if I wanted to meet him for coffee at the old spot with his friend. We met there, and I'm zoning out then my attention is brought to someone a few city blocks literally hunched over still standing by a trashcan and a stack of littered reusable grocery bags. The only reason I saw him was I was staring into the distance there and saw a big telephoto lense face dead at our table then disappear. Another time two days later I gave my friend a ride to go pray in the morning, and out of nowhere, like they literally spawned I was being tailgated by a black suburban all tinted out so dark I can't see. It quickly peeled off down another street after tailgating the way cops who are about to run tags do. That is how people drive in this city so I didn't connect that to all of this until, throughout the 5 blocks surrounding my friends place of worship on the route I took him were the exact same looking cars parked with the other cars on the street Parallel to curb. No lights (early am) yet can see exhaust running.

Wtf is going on? I'd guess it's worth noting my friend is a Muslim student who campaigned to get people to donate to doctors without borders and used his education connections to get a lot of prestigious donations to this. Like he raised a lot of money. He became way more political than when I saw him too, like he follows nothing but socialist and religious pages. Would the government really target him for this? Is he about to have something bad happen to him if the usa starts going Adolf on immigrants? Is this far right nut jobs of the private kind? What the heck could possibly be going on. I don't think my government is targeting people based on religion or political ideas so who is doing this? If there was a boxtruck near my friends house in a park with a dhs ""for official use only"" plates could that be related? Wtf would that even be. The truck was there for 4 days never moved then gone. We have pics.",5,1729822306.0,RBI,12,0.67,False

Could it be something else?,"Hi so recently my mom and I got some lion's mane mushroom powder to add to coffee in the morning and each time I've had it (not many times, it's disgusting) I've gotten a fuzzy throat feeling and not long later threw up a little bit. 

I have a shellfish allergy (have had my whole life, know it inside and out, this is nothing new) and about a month ago was recently retested for mushroom, zucchini, and avocado: the contents of a fried appetizer I had at a restaurant I go to often and love...but they changed up the menu somewhat recently and I ended up needing my epipen not long after eating this. I figured because there was a little more shrimp on the menu that maybe despite them knowing about the allergy there was some cross contamination in the fry oil or something, but allergist quickly tested me for the other stuff just to be sure. Came up as not allergic, as expected just some unfortunate cross contamination. 

That said I've had this Lion's Mane mushroom powder maybe \~2x before and had the same reaction both times now that I think about it, and very similar to a very very mild version of my shellfish reaction (mild anaphylaxis for shellfish allergy a lot of the time looks like throwing up A LOT ALL NIGHT). Today I had it again and 2 gulps in and throat was fuzzy feeling and I threw up. Didn't last long, pretty fast, said something to my mom about how I think maybe I can't have this and SHE said she's had the same reaction. She's not allergic to anything at all. 

And I just had confirmed that I'm not allergic to mushrooms. 

Is it possible to be allergic to just one type of mushroom? This powdered form was packaged \~20mins from where I live, and I know this mushroom farm weirdly....there's absolutely no chance of shellfish cross pollination going on there. Is this just a non-allergic reaction people might have to it in powdered form (from...grossness? I'm not sure)?

I feel crazy for typing up this post, but mainly just confused by the added layer of mystery that my mom had the same response despite 0 allergies to anything. Any insight is appreciated, at this point I'm just curious.",1,1729821994.0,Allergies,1,1.0,False

You could tell in the podcast how much he really cares about the cases he covers. His voice is so much more soothing than Stephanie’s. Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard and she is so aggressive for no reason and cuts Derrick off constantly. However, Derrick and Kendall together felt like a very professional well put together podcast that really does advocate for the victims which I prefer this style when it comes to true crime. It made me realize that Derrick literally never gets to speak on CW and that is really sad honestly. I hope he breaks away from Stephanie altogether. I am not a fan of his podcast detectives perspective because I think he’s someone that does better with a co host and having conversations with them. Would like to see a podcast in the future with Derrick and a different host. If you didn’t listen to the podcast I definitely recommend it. The commentary Derrick gave was awesome and I was so confused about his business with the criminal coffee but he explains it well and it seems like the money is going to good use which makes me feel better after the sesh podcast where they were talking about money in an uncomfortable way.

I wanted to say that I really love you in a series of people that slipped my grasp. I don’t think about it just because i had a crush on you, I think about you because in the mornings there’s this phrase i use carved into me by an old friend.
“no house with a mood disorder is quiet in the mornings.”

i agree with that wholeheartedly. i wake up and scream a lot of days, and it’s usually something like “f off” “i hate being alive” oh you know, the usual morning scaries. I say it because this is caused by the several rabid coyotes i dare call my friends and children and system. I enjoyed taking two seconds to be two of us in a room and not me in a box with eight of the ‘scallions, even if it was just for coffee or ten minutes. 

I’m sorry for telling you i was leaving so excitedly and brazenly. I was far from understanding how people work, so you see how I often let people escape without knowing I cared. I also have anxiety though, and I know you were so damn upset. I never forgot how you told me those things. I never forgot the depth of the pit in me when I realized you weren’t just, comin’ along sometime soon. I wanted to talk to you, so forgive me for writing when you might have moved on. 

I hope you have. I hope you have an AMAZING boyfriend or girlfriend or parnter. I hope you have a cup of coffee and it doesn’t bother you like it bothers me, because I…I wasn’t well either, or as close to escaping all that as i thought. I know it sounds cruel but after our lives and specifically maybe yours, the kindest thing I feel I might want for you is to not remember me at all as someone that was bound there. That my smiling, dopey grin did not fade after I was readmitted for the ninth time. 

I escaped. I hope you did too, and if you didn’t, I still think about you over coffee most mornings. 
I’m so sorry life wasn’t better to someone as astute and kind (and keen) as you.

i cant help but get super angry when i think about my parent doing things that feels like 'injustice' to me. i think thats the root of my anger is when someone else sees or treats me badly because they think i deserve it. for example, i constantly wash the dishes, his dishes. he will leave plates and cutting boards overnight to become dried up without soaking them, and i scrub and scrub until they finally are clean. but when i slack off on the dishes for a couple of days (as in a plate and a cup) he will wash them but not wash my waterbottle. this is something he constantly does regardless but he will take my dirty waterbottle out of the sink and wash everything else. when i wash the dishes, i think of this and it makes me super pissed because i always wash his stupid disgusting cups that are stained from coffee and tea but he can't quickly rinse my water bottle? and then i wake up at 5am for work and realize i cant fill my bottle because it's dirty so i have to take a dirty bottle to work and wash it before my shift. 

my cat had dental surgery a while ago and she wasnt supposed to eat hard foods for a while. he kept feeding it to her and her gums kept bleeding even tho i literally told him details that it puts her in pain and keeps her from healing. yet he kept feeding her dry food. it made me so angry because this is literally a CAT. it's OUR responsibility to keep her well, not hers, and he just kept making her mouth bleed and i kept having to take her to the vet many times. (she's doing great now) 

i get so angry that it builds up quickly and i randomly scream or throw something hard as i can. i've never been violent to anyone else but i have slammed doors and screamed at people. my dad did do some things to me growing up that my entire family doesn't believe me and keeps me completely out of the loop because of it. they exclude me from things AND let me know about it, like groupchats or important conversations (didn't know my grandpa was dying from CANCER and liver diease until way later). i feel resentful and angry and i keep thinking terrible thoughts. i know that i was a happy, loving person but i feel like i've turned into this disgusting ugly girl who makes other people feel bad because i feel bad.

We are a married couple, we're both bi, we have had partners come and go over the years, but I swear, I have yet to meet another actual ""bi"" guy.
Every time, like, without fail, someone will say something like, ""yeah for sure I'd like to be with both of you!"" 
All enthusiastic, and then when things start to progress, turns out they aren't really into bi stuff, or they're on the fence, or they're wanting to explore, Mayne slowly some other time, regardless of how specific we are, and it's pretty fucking specific, 
It turns into ""I'll gladly take a shot at your wife, but this bisexual thing, well, turns out, insert bullshit here"" 

Like every time. 
Has anyone else had this happen? Get to know someone over a period of weeks or months, have them repeatedly say the same thing, video chats, all is well, when we finally meet its like I'm offering them a cup of coffee while I go sit in the corner, 
Not like I'm sharing the best thing I've ever been a part of. 

For clarity, I am deeply in love with my wife, and she loves me just as much, it's been 11 wonderful years, and I wouldn't change a thing, she's my soulmate, and changed my life forever instantly when I met her. 

As I say, we're both bi, and to ask another to deny a part of themselves just isn't how we roll. We want each other to have everything and anything that they want. 
We're pretty open, we like to be straight up, and in response it's usually some underhanded workaround, 

I'm really hoping that everyone else has had a much more positive experience and that it's just a me thing, 
Or are we really akin to some kind or endangered species?

What is your highest survival time? (Excluding the weird bug that gives insanely high numbers)

It's called ""infinite mode"", but before the DRDR added in the Cultists and Spec Ops, it was just the Survivors and Psychopaths you could get items from in the original. So you were quite literally dealing with finite resources and couldn't keep going after a certain time because you eventually run out of the 50 Survivors and however many Psychopaths. Now, with the Cultists and Spec Ops added, you have more chances for randomized loot to hand you some good healing items to keep going. That makes it seem truly like an infinite mode where it's up to you (and RNG) to keep it up for as long as possible.

My second question—Is there any possible max out for this if that's truly a possibility?

Side note—As of right now, I've just finished the 8 day requirement for the two rewards. I went out for one last hurrah and unloaded my guns into Spec Ops and Cultists, looking to cash in with only a pack of frozen veggies in my inventory.

I read people's testimonies about how much better life is without social media. I want to quit it, but I CANNOT. I've tried deleting apps, only to reinstall them 2 days later. I've tried app blockers, to block/time my usuage, but I keep on changing it so I have enough time to access everything I need to during the day. I have also tried putting my phone in a designated spot... But that lasted a few hours. I walk with my phone in my hand everywhere I go in the house. If we go somewhere with no reception, I will still be using the phone for anything. When I have deleted social media, I then start using my phone looking at photos, editing photos, using the calculator, checking my banking app. It's almost like I just need to do something... anything on my phone. 

I have been addicted to my phone since 2008. I would say that the last 6 years have just been addiction on another level. When I downloaded the app blocking app, it said that I use my phone for 6hrs a day!! Imagine 6hrs x 365, x several years. How productive I could have been. I feel like this addiction has consumed me on every level. I feel like it's affecting my life, my marriage, my relationship eith my kids, and completely removing any motivation from creating a success of myself. 

I deleted TikTok 3 years ago and haven't looked back. I stopped posting on Instagram 2 years ago. Stopped using Instagram a few months ago (besides the posts I do for my job's account). All of this felt easy because I was just over it, and it wasn't contributing any value to my life. I have now also quit another 10 + year addiction recently... I don't eat anything with sugar. It was hard for the first 3 weeks, but it's easy now and just a part of life! 

In saying all of this Facebook has me in a chokehold. I cannot get off FB. I frequently post photos, comment and like on friends and family posts. Interact on neighbourhood and shared interest groups. I watch videos now and then. I use it to keep up with birthdays, and I love seeing memories pop up from years ago.I feel like I get so much joy from Facebook. TikTok and Instagram were just so broad and international, but FB still has that small town community vibe. I also use FB to do posts for my job, as well as my own side-business. My side-business would not exist if it weren't for FB - Marketing it on my page and groups. I am also obsessed with FB Marketplace, although I only buy/sell something like 5/6 times a year. I'm checking it every day! 

Then there is Reddit. I can get lost on Reddit for hours. I love it. 

I know this is all bad for me though. As much as I get enjoyment out of this, I feel like my mental health is poor, despite exercising everyday, eating well and getting good sleep. I feel like I'm constantly buzzing with anxiety (I don't drink coffee, so it's not that). 

My current job is SO easy. I'm alone 95% of the time and I literally get paid to be here and do my own thing. I should be using this opportunity to make more money or do something productive, but as soon as I get to work, I will spend the first two hours at least, just doomscrolling. My attention span is nowhere. I don't remember being bored since 2008. 

How do I get my life back?? I use social media for fun, to avoid boredom, and to definitely to avoid uncomfortable feelings. I feel like I have an internal dialog asking 20 questions a day, and I need the answers NOW, and then I can Google a topic for the next hour. I love getting lost in reading comments and people's experiences. I also love chatting with friends over WhatsApp. We send voicenotes to each other everyday, so I'm probably spending 1hr chatting with friends a day. 

Please, any suggestions big or small that could help me, I would deeply appreciate it. It feels something I have to quit entirely, but because I still find value in it, is it even possible to keep it, and just reduce usuage to 30mins a day? Or do I have to go cold turkey?

Hi all, I just picked up this pair of Park Aves on eBay for a steal of $120. They are brand new Park Aves in coffee.

The fit on these feels good overall. Toes aren’t pinched, can wiggle them around and long enough without the flip flop effect. No heel slip whatsoever but not extremely tight, no excess space in the back or sides of heel. Flex point is right under the widest part of my foot. 

However my feet are a bit oddly shaped: I have a normal heel, a slightly WIDER but not wide midfoot, and normal width toes/forefoot.

1gbj4yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gbj4yv/fall_for_me_grace/,"Fall For Me, Grace","It started innocently enough. A glance here, a smile there. Grace sat two rows ahead of me in that stuffy lecture hall, her head tilted in concentration, fingers twirling a strand of dark hair. But it was her lips, painted a deep, velvety red, that I couldn’t shake from my mind. They were always perfect, like they could leave an impression on everything they touched. I couldn’t focus on anything else.

I tried to talk to her every chance I got. We bumped into each other after class, at the library, and once even outside the dining hall. Each time, she’d smile, those red lips drawing me in like a moth to a flame. For weeks, I made excuses to be where she was. After a couple of months, I finally worked up the nerve to ask her out.

“I thought you’d never ask,” she said, her voice soft but playful. The way she smiled at me, the way those red lips curved, sent a chill down my spine, but I wrote it off as nerves.

We went out for coffee, and soon that turned into late-night walks, study sessions that lasted way too long, and eventually, we were dating. Things were good at first. She was beautiful, smart, and mysterious in a way that kept me hooked. But as the semester ended and summer rolled around, things began to change. Grace began to change.

It started small. She became possessive, always wanting to know where I was and who I was with. At first, I thought it was cute. She cared, right? But then it escalated. If I didn’t respond to her texts fast enough, her replies would turn nasty. She’d accuse me of ignoring her or seeing other girls. Sometimes she’d show up at my dorm, unannounced, demanding to go through my phone. It was unsettling, but I still told myself it was no big deal. Relationships had rough patches, right?

One night, I woke to a soft tapping on my bedroom window. It was a ground-floor dorm, so I assumed it was a branch or maybe the wind. Groggy, I got out of bed and pulled the blinds open.

There she was. Grace, hanging upside down, her body dangling from the roof above. Her hair fell toward the ground, her eyes wide with an eerie calmness. And her lips, still painted that deep red, split into a grin.

""Gotcha,"" she whispered, her breath fogging the glass.

I screamed, falling back and scrambling for the door. She laughed as she climbed back up, disappearing into the dark. I couldn’t sleep the rest of the night. The next day, she acted like it was just a prank, something silly to mess with me. But there was something in her eyes that chilled me, something cruel.

It didn’t stop there. She started messing with me more often. One weekend, we went on a trip to the lake with my family. It was supposed to be a relaxing getaway, but Grace had other plans. She found my dad’s shotgun in the cabin, loaded it, and pointed it directly at me.

""Bang,"" she said, smirking.

I froze. My parents were out on the water, and it was just us. Her finger hovered over the trigger for a second longer than it should have before she set the gun down, laughing like it was all a joke. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that she had been just a fraction of a second away from pulling it.

She wasn’t the same Grace I had fallen for. Or maybe she was, and I had just ignored the signs.

The final straw came one night after she chased me around the house with one of the kitchen knives, her face twisted in something that was both rage and joy. I managed to lock myself in the bathroom, but she stood outside the door, banging on it, screaming my name.

""You think you can leave me?!"" she shrieked. ""You think you can get away from me?!""

The police arrived after I finally managed to call them. When they got there, the house was quiet, and Grace was gone. They searched everywhere, but she had vanished without a trace. They didn’t believe me about the shotgun, or the knives, or the time she dangled from my window like a nightmare come to life. Of course they didn't.

That was two weeks ago. They still haven’t found her.

Some days she (25F) doesn't look at me (24M) at all, and others she comes up to talk. ","To preface, I come up to her a lot to talk to her. It's just that sometimes she comes up to me to talk and there's times where she wouldn't even look at me the entire shift. I'm very confused :/. I so badly want to ask her for coffee but I guess the anxiety of rejection is really stopping me. 

I (24M) have a crush on my coworker (25M). I’ve known her for 2 years now and my crush developed in the last year or so. She’s gorgeous, soft-spoken, intelligent, and very feminine. I started realizing I really liked her because I’d start getting nervous around her and because I’d think about her outside of work. Between us, we have kind of a professional relationship, it's getting a bit more personal though. We both are tutors. 

Usually when I’m in public, I put on a mask that I’m very confident, but deep down I’m not. I’m currently going to therapy for this so I can change how I talk to myself. Anyways, at the end of my shift yesterday I was feeling very tired and drained, I didn’t feel like talking to anybody. All of a sudden at the end of the shift, she approached to talk to me. She's been coming up to me to talk recently and is very receptive to when I initiate too. So I'm just lost as to why she didn't even want to make eye contact with me today, she just immediately left work. Maybe she had something on her mind? Was she shy? Does she get nervous around me? She doesn't like me? 

I feel like I get signs from her though. The other day she told me that I’d be such a good “girl dad” (I usually give off like big brother vibes to my students, I’m funny but also strict with them). Btw I’m not sure what exactly that means tbh. She's also been getting into deeper convos with me.

I’ve been feeling off. Not sure if it’s anxiety or a deeper issue. I get this faint feeling where my head slightly drops, slightly light headed and sudden need to take a deep breath. There is also pressure in my ear especially my right ear. Happens randomly , usually when I’m sitting or feeling stressed.


It started all the way back to the end of 2022 and beginning of 2023. I was truck driving for work. Under a lot of stress everyday I wasn’t eating much or sleeping and actually almost fainted once or twice but I pushed through it everyday. (No caffeine no stimulants) I was living almost in a fog and on non work days no matter how much I ate I still felt empty.   Driving big rig wake up 3 am get home 9 pm terrible sleep barely eat through the day. Hold in my bowl movements when I can’t use the restroom and shit my brains out in the morning. I pushed myself past my physical limitations and feels like I broke my natural helpful internal signals. I felt myself become more and more tired/angry everyday.
Once I had Quit I felt relief but that’s when the vertigo really started to happen. I waited a bit to go to doctor and once I did I got meclizine . I started to take it everyday it helped a bit but I started to feel really tired and anxious. I finished up all the medicine and I felt like I was “normal” again until it came back but it felt worse than before. I became even more anxious and started to have constant headaches/ migraines everyday. Felt completely nauseous . I went back to that same doctor and said there’s nothing he can do . Something was up with a simple blood test but I retook it and didn’t bother going over it with me why I had to retake it. So I spent the whole year in pain. (2023 I worked for about a month while on the vertigo medicine but quit cuz I supposedly had another job offer that didn’t pan out, this was maybe March-April) Experiencing stomach pains,migraines/headaches, nausea, titnitus, dizziness, lack of focus and confusion.
Maybe it was a combination of stomach issue, sleeping, breathing?
I would wake up with headaches sometimes the dizziness woke me up in the middle of the night. Doing any simple easy task made me stressful, anxious and nauseous.( it felt like super ultra anxiety without mental spiraling) It also felt like there was someone pushing a finger into the right side of my brain. No matter how relaxed or chilled whatever I was i still felt like shit. I would get nauseous and dizzy when I was hungry and find a second of relieve when I would eat but then I would feel nauseous after eating as well.
No matter how much rest at night or breaks during the day I felt sick and getting up in the mornings were very difficult.
Going to the gym would make it worse. I had constant acid reflux as well. I do not drink or smoke or any drugs but It felt like I had a hangover everyday and nothing would help. I was always tired and couldn’t recover. 
Before driving professionally I would regularly go to the gym 2-4 times a week but my diet did get a little bad over time. I was still going to the gym when I started driving but I got significantly more fatigued barely finish and almost fainted once. (Probably from lack of nutrition and sleep though I did not lose weight throughout this time)
I got a seasonal gig around holiday time driving and delivering packages. I was a bit more able to push myself but I had some bad mornings where I puked on an empty stomach which never happened to me before.

Come around to the beginning of this year I started to feel little better. I had almost fainted again for no reason but then the headaches stopped hurting or I became numb to it because I would still feel my head pulsing but it stopped hurting. 

In March 2024 I went to get checked again  by a different doctor but apparently my symptoms are too vague to do anything. The week Before going in I had some sort of vertigo attack. I was stretching on the floor and slowly started to feel bad so I went to rest on my bed as it was time to sleep anyways. I was feeling sick and dizzy but slowly feeling ok as I tried to sleep but once I did a big good stretch in bed it hit me very hard. A bad ringing started in my ear and I went to the bathroom wanting to either throw up or go number 2. I went number two and I was feeling dizzy. I then started to puke a lot as   Well which has never happened to me before. Puking and going #2 at the same time. I saw many different things in my vomit and at the end it seemed kinda like tar. Blackish brownish coffee grounds. I brought this to my doctors attention but it’s too vague I guess. Blood and urine tests suggested I had a fatty liver, protein in my urine and need vitamin d but I noticed other weird results I didn’t ask about it.
I picked up another seasonal gig that lasted longer for spring summer fall season.

I was still dealing with this issue so I went again in May 2024 and doctor chalked it up to depression.  I received escitalopram that I have not taken because I’m concerned of worsening symptoms. Each day I was slowly feeling a little better but randomly would feel light headed and have sudden anxiety attacks.

Working the seasonal thing was an easy job but having these sudden symptoms made me anxious at first but it became a lot more manageable even though I unintentionally lost some weight in the process. 

I don’t know what to tell my doctor to get them to help me. I did try mentioning syncope as my friend suggested I ask about but I was dismissed.
Is my brain fucked or is this extreme accumulated fatigue? It seemed like it was a bunch of things that fed into each other making me feel worse and worse. As of today I do feel more normal and kinda feel maybe it’s just anxiety now but the whole ordeal feels like it really messed with my head. I sometimes get slight dizzy without the pain but I get pressure in my ears. I never fainted before but I sometimes do get this weird feelin where my head slightly drops and down and my eyes close a little and then I get this urge to take a big deep breath. I sometimes get random ringing in my ear. My acid reflux isn’t as bad but kinda doesn’t feel normal. I cleaned up my diet it feels better but doesn’t feel normal as in before I had all these problems.
It feels difficult to simply exist.
Am I just over reacting? I feel like I’ll just get dismissed again. I’ve gone through moments/phases in my life where I felt anxious and depressed. I’m familiar with different feelings of these and different triggers but this is something completely different that I could barely push through.

Is it possible I fucked my brain up from pushing myself too hard? Thinking or talking about this experience is a little difficult for me it was just overwhelming so some things might not make sense or a little all over the place.",2,1729820101.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I bad bullying problems back then so i couldn't beat the bullies but i took it on the dog. I wish instead of the dog that i tortured my bullies by gouging their eyes, setting them on fire, etc... you imagine.

I never felt i had a place in that word anyways, that's been the way since practicly as far as i remember. Iv'e not been much happy in my life.

I've had racist views during my late teens and my early tweenties then they lowered and then it started towards an hatred towards women and incel beliefs i'm now 30. I've never had much success with women, but incels beliefs make it much worse.

Autism, cptsd, aspd, low social skills, and negative and hateful ideas, not very much attractive to women, they want thoses funny charismatic, positive chads, which are the majority of men atleast they're ahead compared to me. Is me having a bad relationship overall with women and being late to the race and competition a valid reason to hate women? Cause that's what i think.

Today i left the communataty group cause i coundn't handle it anymore women not enjoying my presence, then when leavind and towards my home, i avoided women like changing sides and running away from them on the sidewalk and even saying bad stuff to some of them just to get at them.

Also huge procrastination, addiction to alcohol and coffee, not doing positive thinking exercises much or other stuff, sometimes watching violent content or gore stuff occasionaly. Not much of a lifestyle or learning new stuff.

I am writing about a question that has really been nagging at me for the past several weeks, and I guess I'm looking for some consolation/thoughts on the matter.

I've recently started biking with LO (10 months, almost 11) using a Thule bike seat that sits comfortable right in front of me as a bike; he wears a baby helmet, and I try to be extremely careful. There is a lovely urban area near where I live with a bike path, greenery, coffee shops, everything a millenial could wish for - except in order to get there, I have to cross some very very heavy traffic. We have to go along a clogged highway for a bit (on the sidewalk) and then bike along a highway ramp (on a bike path, separated by a short wall nonetheless) before we end up in the paradisical area. And this is what is causing my mental blockage.

I guess it boils down to, how bad is 10 minutes or so of heavy traffic for the LO? I have tried to research this question as much as I could, and it seems that for adults the exercise I am getting will definitely outweigh the effects of bad air (according to one study, you'd have to cycle in London for hours on end to outweigh the benefits of exercising).

Obviously, once we get to the town, we go to a playground or frolic in the grass... so I do my best to entertain him, look at the doggies, say hello to the other babies etc. But my guilt is nagging at me because I feel like I'm mostly taking him along so that I could get some exercise while watching him. Admittedly, moving about like this really helps my mental (and physical) health!

I have tried seeking alternative routes and going around, but no matter what you do, you have to cross the beltway somehow. Sigh. This is also a reminder of how highways really do cut up neighborhoods and make something not too far away feel pretty inaccessible.

I have a bike rack for the car, but it's a simple one that you attach to the back only when using it, so when I start to think of pushing my bike w/baby in seat downstairs (we are in an apartment) while somehow holding bike rack in one hand, the whole outing just becomes too much.

In sum, is it okay that I am taking LO on this? Should I try to get him an infant N95? I have no idea how he would keep it on if they do make them his size, I can barely get him to be okay with the helmet. Should I suck it up and somehow figure out how to carry bike rack and bike? Get different rack? Or just try to get over it, because in the pre-baby era I would bike this way on my own without giving it second thought...

Fortunately with the sun/heat last week and a kind suggestion from a friend to use one of the desiccator packs they make for closets it dried without obvious mold/mildew.

BUT the interior of my car now smells of rich dark roasted coffee goodness which while enjoyable I need to get rid of. 

AND as a second note my oldest spilled some chum from one of his fishing trips onto the carpet in his car that dried.  We've washed it a few times and it's 100x better than it was but we'd still like to try to get the dead rotting fish smell out of the car too if possible.

Anyone have any suggestions?  Worst case I could always use a spray bottle of Oxyclean I guess...

1gbiiqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1gbiiqg/biking_with_baby_suburb_problems/,Biking with baby - suburb problems…,"Hello hive mind!! I am writing about a question that has really been nagging at me for the past several weeks, and I guess I'm looking for some consolation/thoughts on the matter.

I've recently started biking with LO (10 months, almost 11) using a Thule bike seat that sits comfortable right in front of me as a bike; he wears a baby helmet, and I try to be extremely careful. There is a lovely urban area near where I live with a bike path, greenery, coffee shops, everything a millenial could wish for - except in order to get there, I have to cross some very very heavy traffic. We have to go along a clogged highway for a bit (on the sidewalk) and then bike along a highway ramp (on a bike path, separated by a short wall nonetheless) before we end up in the paradisical area. And this is what is causing my mental blockage.

I guess it boils down to, how bad is 10 minutes or so of heavy traffic for the LO? I have tried to research this question as much as I could, and it seems that for adults the exercise I am getting will definitely outweigh the effects of bad air (according to one study, you'd have to cycle in London for hours on end to outweigh the benefits of exercising).

Obviously, once we get to the town, we go to a playground or frolic in the grass... so I do my best to entertain him, look at the doggies, say hello to the other babies etc. But my guilt is nagging at me because I feel like I'm mostly taking him along so that I could get some exercise while watching him. Admittedly, moving about like this really helps my mental (and physical) health!

I have tried seeking alternative routes and going around, but no matter what you do, you have to cross the beltway somehow. Sigh. This is also a reminder of how highways really do cut up neighborhoods and make something not too far away feel pretty inaccessible.

I have a bike rack for the car, but it's a simple one that you attach to the back only when using it, so when I start to think of pushing my bike w/baby in seat downstairs (we are in an apartment) while somehow holding bike rack in one hand, the whole outing just becomes too much.

In sum, is it okay that I am taking LO on this? Should I try to get him an infant N95? I have no idea how he would keep it on if they do make them his size, I can barely get him to be okay with the helmet. Should I suck it up and somehow figure out how to carry bike rack and bike? Get different rack? Or just try to get over it, because in the pre-baby era I would bike this way on my own without giving it second thought...

","Aliens lately are called Spiritual, multidimensional, timeless and spaceless. Please think about this words. They describe entities that only partially exist or penetrate our reality. Keep in mind their “other part” is in realm unimaginable to us. Like an iceberg underwater.

   How is that possible? Thought experiment: Downscale our 3D world to 2D as if we are people on a flat sheet of paper, and higher dimension, represented by a cube can go through our flat world and at every moment of time there would be only a single “slice” of a cube inside the sheet of paper fabric.

[Our \\""flat\\"" world-reality is a blue sheet inside. And the 3D cube here resembles the \\""body\\"" of \\""aliens\\"" that penetrate our reality as they wish\/can and creat this simulation.](https://preview.redd.it/eiw7makmwswd1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=710d80d616d416799f5087ccd33665efa706a904)

But that’s not exactly it! Aliens are not material higher dimensional cubes. They are something “3D” that feels in our imaginable “2D” world as narratives, events, stories only when it ""goes"" through us in a certain manner! 

Do you get it? This is very hard to grasp but please try. Any Events visible by us ARE this penetration. Event types like walking to school or drinking coffee, browsing reddit - it is something you can imagine and something you can put as a goal and live through your life toward it. So the event like “drink coffee” is timeless and spaceless itself, fundamental as math. It happened to many people before you and will happen again. And for aliens that is one single moment and place!

**“Drinking coffee” and all that leads to and from it is a single case that is a “body structure part” of an alien in our reality. Same as all other ever existed in past and existing in future TYPES of narratives and events.**

You have the illusion that you run your body. It is run by some aliens from higher realms that propagate through your consciousness that consist of narratives created and detected in time. It's probably true because neither you nor I understand for 100% what we live for, what is the goal? You live and understand reality only because you follow some ideas and goals. And their fundamental meanings are a mystery to us.

It is obvious as bees that don't see beekeeper but suspect he exists.
