\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`

SO MY WIFE and I arrived back in what felt to be the lap of luxury at the Detroit Hare Krishna Temple, at least compared to what we had just experienced at the Dallas Temple. We were taken back, ‘forgiven’ and even ended up getting an apartment without much trouble. We had been part of that temple for a while and were like family, granted it was a cult family with cult family boundaries that would give us shit for wanting to be together like an ordinary man and wife or even for having furniture.

When the Fischer Mansion was purchased by Alfred Ford and we were finally done moving everything from the older Jefferson Street Temple to the new Fischer Mansion, my wife and I were given an apartment close by. It was a cute little place with some character and we naturally wanted to make it as nice as possible, of course nothing too extravagant as we were Hare Krishna devotees who lived a very minimalist lifestyle and were expected to by the temple authorities even if we were not single monks pretending to be celibate.

My wife and I had bought a small inexpensive unstained pine coffee table when we moved into our apartment, we stained it together and were happy with the outcome, it felt good to be doing something together for a change something for ourselves. It was one of the very first things we ever bought together for an apartment, it was nice to have something to eat on instead of the bare floor as well as a piece of furniture in our otherwise mostly empty apartment.

All monthly expenses we incurred as householders living outside the temple had to be submitted and approved by the Temple Management. When it was my turn to submit our maintenance expenses for the month of the coffee table purchase I told them about it and was immediately given a hard time in return, them telling me that it was Maya, sense gratification and an unnecessary material attachment.

So here we were my wife and I devotees of that Temple, we had gone out into the streets, parking lots and malls selling Bhaktivedantas books for years before, my wife was 18 when she joined and had never lived outside her home before moving into the temple. We had sacrificed so much of our lives and time and were now being given a hard time over a simple coffee table that we had bought for our apartment, insinuating that we had done something wrong in buying and possessing it.

This was coming from the temple management who had just moved into a fucking mansion. They were sitting across from me telling me how this coffee table was Maya with a huge ornate over-sized desk sprawled out in front of them, having the finest of everything on it, pen set, calendar, nice desk lamp you name it. It was the Fischer Mansion no expense spared everything had to be ‘First Class’ to attract the ‘Topmost Class’ of men to these teachings of Bhaktivedanta.

And here I was a one time very good book seller and money collector who had been around long before this Mansion ever popped up, way before anyone ever heard the name Alfred Ford I was out collecting money to keep the heat on in the dead of winter at that old Jefferson Street Temple and now they were giving me shit for having bought an unfinished small coffee table for our apartment.

So now I was annoyed at them for giving me a hard time about the coffee table on top of still being extremely annoyed by what happened right before my wife and I were sent away to Dallas.

At the old Detroit Hare Krishna Temple on Jefferson Street, right before our Dallas Temple exile we had been waiting for Bhaktivedanta to arrive for the past couple of months. He was to give 2nd initiation to several of us my wife and I included. We had already received 1st initiation (called Harinam which is initiation into chanting Hare Krishna plus a Spiritual name) and were now waiting for our 2nd initiation or ‘Brahmin initiation’ as they called it in Iskcon.

We would be given a Brahmin thread to wear and say Gayatri mantra which was also given at this initiation. This initiation was said to bring you closer to the spiritual master, in Iskcon it was considered the primary initiation or diksha although none of us at that time had any idea what diksha was.

In Iskcon and Gaudiya Math everyone receives this Brahmin initiation (if they stick around long enough) I was to find out years later that this Brahmin initiation I was about to be given, was surrounded in controversy. This so-called Brahmin initiation given in Iskcon has it’s origins in Gaudiya Math the organization that was founded by Bhaktivedantas Guru Bhaktisiddhanta who himself introduced this Brahmin initiation into his mission.

The controversy is where did Bhaktisiddhanta get his Brahmin initiation from, and where did he get his brahmin-thread from ? His Guru, Gaurakisora did not wear one because he was born a Vaisya and neither did his father Bhaktivinode, you can clearly see this in photos.

The truth is Bhaktisiddhanta didn’t get it from anyone and took it upon himself to introduce this at the time of diksha (initiation) for one reason or another. Gaudiyas who come from Brahmin families you see wearing Brahmin threads yes, but to introduce it as a standard practice that is given to everyone as part of diksha is Bhaktisiddhantas brainchild and with good reason questionable.

Bhaktisiddhanta also gave himself Sannyas (Monkhood) in front of a photo of his Guru which is as well quite unusual and certainly not acceptable by any spiritual tradition in India as a legitimate means to take formal Sannyas. I want to emphasize here that Bhaktisiddhanta introduced these innovations of Brahmin initiation and Sannyas into ‘HIS’ mission and his mission alone, and this needs to be understood in it’s proper context.

Iskcon and Gaudiya Math see Bhaktisiddhanta as an empowered acharya or teacher who was sent by Krishna himself to save humanity with his teachings, they think that because he made these innovations in “His Mission” the Gaudiya Math that it was now officially part of the entire Gaudiya religion across the board, like he was the head of the religion or something and was setting a new standard that was to be adopted by all, a new dispensation for the entire Gaudiya religion, this is not true, not at all.

Gaudiya Math was like a Jehovah’s Witness or missionary version of the older traditional Gaudiya Vaishnava religion and Bhaktisiddhantas innovations were seen as radical and questioned right away even by some of his own people. When he gave himself Sanyass and came out on the veranda to greet and show all the devotees afterwards that had gathered, they themselves were in shock, taken back, some even cried like what has he done!

Back at the Jefferson Street Temple my wife and I were waiting for Bhaktivedanta to show up to give us this controversial initiation that his Guru introduced, he was to arrive in about two weeks. A huge elaborate ceremony would take place where my wife and I along with several other devotees would get this initiation, we were completely clueless about the controversy that was behind it as well as so many other things in the Gaudiya religions past.

Right around this time is when our temple president complained to our GBC Jagadish that my wife and I were having difficulty in following and they decided it would be a good idea to send us off to the Dallas Temple to get ‘Fixed Up’ and stop falling down into ‘sex life’ as Hare Krishnas often call it, just having normal sex is equated to a life of sex very strange.

In sending us off to Dallas Temple at that time they made us miss our 2nd initiation ceremony with Bhaktivedanta that we had been waiting for and it left us completely devastated as you may imagine. They sent us away because we were basically acting like normal married people, however, sex can never be a normal thing in the Hare Krishna world, it is only treated like a toxic poison to be avoided at all costs, however Hare Krishnas seem to be some of the most sexually messed up people on the planet.

Bhaktivedanta endlessly rants on and on in his books about the evils of sex and women as his own Guru ranted on and on against association of women and men who associated with them. This says one thing to me and that is Fear, these so-called acharyas and big preachers are ‘Fearful’ of sex and women, thus they are always ranting against them. Telling people to stay away, keep your distance, don’t talk to them, don’t talk to other men who talk to them, don’t sit where they sat.

It’s about fear of sexuality, their own sexuality and fear of being attracted by a women and loosing control. Fear and fascination and the fear is what keeps them condemning, speaking out against women and sex otherwise why bother, if you are free and on such a high level of prem as a pure devotee, why are you so bothered by sex and women that you have to endlessly rant in your preaching about them.

What was strange was that they sent my wife and I away to that Snake Pit Dallas Hare Krishna Temple that years later was found out to be infested with child abuse.

What a Joke, Really?! That was where my wife and I would learn how to act properly, that was where we would get ‘Fixed Up’ and free from sex desire? These were crazy people we had given our lives over to and were allowing them to control us, sending us here or there according to their whim. We were so damn lucky we had the guts to just up and leave that place after a month and never look back.

My wife and I felt betrayed, we had done more work, sold more books, collected more money than many of the other devotees put together, my wife would go out in the parking lots, get harassed and propositioned by men when selling Hare Krishna books putting herself in risky situations and I was continually being put into unsafe situations as well.

Bhaktivedanta had already accepted us as his disciples, our names were on the letter that was sent from him accepting us for the 2nd or ‘Brahmin’ initiation. Sending us away two weeks before Bhaktivedanta was about to come was complete and utter bullshit to us at the time and it was only because we were acting like normal married people who wanted to be together.

After the coffee table incident we realized that it had all changed in Detroit, new Temple Management was coming in, a new Temple President and GBC as well, big money people were now in charge and it was out with the old in with the new. Not too long thereafter Bhaktivedanta passed away and we were done with Detroit Temple and headed west, away from the cold and depressing parking lots of Detroit into the warm sunshine of Los Angeles California…

Dont know if that one-sentence structure adds to anything.,"https://preview.redd.it/mgx6mvrw64gg1.jpg?width=652&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c3ef994359daae1c4f83d03005d589539cbbb18

Hello! I'm back with my next one. I know I was to share a review of *Origin* by Dan Brown first. But it's such a tome, and finishing it has been such a task, that I decided to pick up something light in the meantime. This novella, however, is only light in size.   
  
Laszlo Krasznohorkai is a writer who deals in the weight of the world: the slow, inevitable fading of nature and the heavy silence that follows. In this novella, featuring *The Last Wolf* and *Herman*, we are given two very different windows into this darkness. While the book is undeniably powerful, it is also a frustrating experience of two halves. It wasn't clear to me though as to why these two stories were put together, besides a loose overarching theme of beasts and humanity.

# The Burden of Style

The first story, *The Last Wolf*, is written entirely as one single, winding sentence. It follows a washed-up philosopher in a Berlin bar who recounts his trip to the Spanish region of Extremadura to find the last wolf. While this ""marathon"" style is Krasznohorkai’s trademark and granted, this is my introduction to his works, it felt a bit like a gimmick to me in this book at least. The constant stream of clauses makes you focus more on the mechanics of the writing than the tragedy of the story. You find yourself watching the prose rather than feeling the extinction it describes.

When the narrator notes that he ""...didn’t want to look at anything anymore, he didn’t want to see anything, because everything he saw was a joke,"" the technical difficulty of the long sentence actually blunts the sharp edge of his despair. It’s an exhausting choice that begs the question: does this structure add anything, or is it just a barrier?

# The Raw Impact of Herman

In stark contrast, the second part of the book, *Herman*, is a complete gutpunch. Herman is an expert trapper hired to clear a forest of ""harmful"" predators. Unlike the first story, this narrative is sharp and direct. When Herman’s moral compass finally breaks and he begins to see the humans as the true predators, the impact is visceral. It lacks the self-conscious density of the first half, opting instead for a cold, piercing tragedy. One wonders why the first part couldn’t have shared this devastating clarity, the story of the trapper feels much more grounded and haunting because it doesn't hide behind a stylistic trick.

# A World Fading to Black

Philosophically, the book explores the deep rift between humanity and the natural world. Krasznohorkai presents a bleak view: once we destroy the wild ""holy"" elements of our world, like the wolf, human consciousness becomes a lonely, meaningless mistake. It is a meditation on the fact that we cannot return to nature once we have corrupted it.

Despite my issues with the one-sentence structure, this book is itself pretty great. Krasznohorkai’s ability to describe desolation is pretty intense. 

I finished the final page feeling deeply unsettled, and I am desperate to read more of his haunting work. Richard Yates' description of the moribund and the desolate comes close to what I read here in this extremely short representation.

Place - Revere PD station

Murphy and Corso return from the Rawdogging murder scene. They look worn out , shocked at the gore and the undeniable reality that not only do the Revere Riders still suck but to make matters worse a serial killer is at large. As the two detectives enter the station they are met by Officer Dillon who suffered a near career ending injury in a car accident years ago, rather than medically retire he chose to stay on at the station and handle the duties of the desk officer which largely amounts to giving kids stickers and telling people how to evict deadbeat roommates. “Murph, Corso, shit , good thing you guys are back. There is a student who just showed up about an hour ago. His name is Sam Ellerbe and he is waiting for you in the interview room , you're going to want to hear what he has to say.”

The detectives look through a glass window into the interview room and see a young male in his early 20's who can't seem to sit still. Murphy turns back towards Dillon “Hey Dilly is the microphone and recorders running? Has he said anything yet?” 

Dillon nods, shuffling some papers on his desk before taking another sip of his coffee “I told him just to wait, I didn't want to crowbar my way into this shit show of an investigation.  The only thing he said is that someone tried to attack him last night in the same alleyway and the retarded kid got killed.” 

Corso looks at Murphy excited to have their first witness “ Fuck me…Dillon is that pot of coffee got anything left in it?” 

Dillon stands to walk revealing his prosthetic leg and responds “I'll get a new pot going guys”

Murphy enters the interview room and looks over Mr.Ellerbe , he appears unharmed but is clearly terrified, he can't sit still and keeps looking around as if someone else, perhaps Batman will just appear in the room and beat the shit out of him for fun.

Murphy sits down across from the young man and begins to speak while Corso stands off to the side “Heard you had a rough night ? Can we get you anything?”

Sam Ellerbe quietly replies “Water would be nice.”

Corso walks towards the door to kill two birds with one stone for coffee and water “No, problem, just so you know this is being recorded , do you want to talk about what happened?”

A minute or two later Corso returns and sets the Styrofoam cup down in front of Sam who then begins to speak in a hushed tone “I went to a Halloween party at Duck Butters bar last night down by the river. I don't know what happened but I started feeling really sick so I left early about 1145. I wanted to get back to the dorms because I had some serious bubble guts and took a shortcut through the alleyway behind Rawdogging.”

Murphy takes a few notes to remember to ask follow up questions “ What time do you think that was?”

Sam's eyes look up and to the left as he tries to recall the event “ Maybe just after midnight, anyway I got almost halfway down the alley and saw his creepy as fuck looking clown..at first I thought it was some students fucking with me, you know a prank or something.”  

Corso takes a swig from his coffee “Did he say anything at all to you?” 

Sam starts to become visibly emotional “No...not a thing.. he just stood there and stared right thru me, not really even at me, like he was in a trance. He had a big ass mallet..and his costume was filthy..I could tell even in the dark. Then suddenly he starts coming towards me. I froze up, I thought I had to shit before I left the bar but my asshole puckered up so tight.. I was so sure I was about to die.”

Murphy skeptically replies “But you're not dead..  how did you get away?” 

Sam takes a deep breath and slowly begins to recount the event “The guy ran at me, he had the hammer over his head like he was gonna drive a rail spike into the ground. I was paralyzed. I wanted to run but my legs wouldn't work. Just as he got close enough to squash my melon, that retard who works inside opened the door. I guess that creepy psychopath got surprised because the retard let out a battlecry or something  and I just ran as fast as I could. I didn't want to see what happened next. I never turned back but I heard a blood curdling retarded scream and then nothing ... .I was so scared man.” he says, his voice shaking with emotion.

Murphy turns to Corso who just rolls his eyes before responding to Sam once more “ You're pretty lucky Sam. What can you tell us about this clown? What does he look like?”

Sam pauses a moment then continues “I really can't say.. I mean it was pretty dark , he was about my height.. thin. That's really all I could see, the clown costume went head to toe”

Murphy gestures to Corso to meet him in the hallway “ Ok ...thanks Sam. We will be back in a few minutes.”

Murphy and Corso exit the room and walk a few extra feet down the hall before turning to each other.” Corso speaks first stating the obvious “ We gotta find out who this clown is...that's our guy.”

Murphy laughs “ No shit, Sherlock, detective school really paid off for you , Ok..let’s think about this.We have a basic time frame, this clown didn't just teleport there. He had to get there somehow. Let's check all the cameras in a 1 mile radius.  Let's see if anybody else reported a weird clown last night... This is the break we have waited for. Let's also look at the costume shops and see if any sold killer clown costumes, with any luck we get this guy on camera or a credit card receipt.”

This one was my letter and I loved CA's advice as well as some comments!

What Happened Next: I met ""Doug"" for coffee again for a work meeting and he shook hands and then held my hand between his again and pressed it. He said that he had a client (a well known organisation) who had commissioned him to write a detailed report on Our Shared Topic of Expertise. Doug said that I would be paid a certain amount of money to write this report and I asked him (a) would my name be on it and (b) can I meet the Important Client to get more details about what they wanted. Doug said no, everything had to go through him and the report would be in his name and I would be a sort of graduate student type researcher. So I said nope.

Obviously. OBVIOUSLY I SAID NO.

Then, Doug went bonkers. I was speaking at a conference that he had sort of been involved with organising and he told me I could still speak but he would ensure that I never got any involvement with the organisation behind the conferences again and then at the conference itself he blanked me despite being the chair of the panel I was speaking on.

If this were now, I would email the conference organisation and inform them about this threat but back then I was far too shy and not as confident.

So yeah, Doug. What did Doug want? Free labour and to pass my work off as his.",1,1769617273.0,captainawkward,0,1.0,False

I know most people go there just to show their face, collect badges and pretend it’s ’brand building’, but if u r already spending money on flights, hotels and overpriced coffee, you might as well try to actually hit quota from it.

So here’s how we usually do conference lead gen without relying on ‘let’s just vibe and network’

1/ Start with the conference website

Literally the most underrated growth hack ever. Every conference has some kind of participants/attendees page. And that page is basically a free lead database that everyone ignores because it’s too obvious.

We just parse everyone from there. Names, companies, roles, sometimes even emails. Usually this is stupidly easy and there are a ton of tools that do it - Octoparse, Crona extension, Browserflow - honestly anything that can grab structured data from a page works.

If you can scroll and click, you can build a list.

2/ Enrich n segment like a normal person

Raw list is useless, it’s just a bunch of names that look good in excel and do nothing for your pipeline.

So we enrich it - get company domains, linkedIn, emails, firmographics, all the boring but necessary stuff. Tools don’t really matter here, use whatever - Apify, Crona, Wiza, Clay, just pick your favorite toy.

So we enriched the dataset with Crona to add the missing pieces like company domains, linkedIn profiles, emails, basic firmographics. Then we filtered it down to something actually workable and kept fintech & B2B only, plus real decision-makers (CEO, Heads, Ops), not ‘marketing Intern - Web3’ - that’s your actual ICP, everything else goes to the trash.

3/ Automated outreach (but not in a psychotic way)

Then we wrap it up with short automated messages right inside the conference networking app or wherever makes sense.

We used Octoparse for that, but you can choose whatever you want (again). Any tool that lets you record your manual clicks once and then replay the whole thing on autopilot works great.

The key is not volume, it’s timing. You’re not spamming the internet, you’re just making sure that by the time you both land at the same event, your name already looks familiar instead of ‘random stranger #247’.

That’s basically it for the outbound part. You’re done n you’re already ahead of 80% of people attending.

Now the second part - surviving the actual conference without losing your mind

1/One of my SDRs was literally watching replies in real time, booking meetings through the in-app calendar and duplicating every slot into my google calendar with names, time, location, notes, everything.

2/At the conference itself my SDR basically saved my life. Navigation, rescheduling, all the ‘where the hell am I supposed to be right now’ stuff. Highly recommend having someone on backup during heavy meeting days, otherwise you just drown in chaos and missed slots.

3/Another thing that works surprisingly well: I load the first half of the day with prebooked, confirmed meetings, and leave the second half for pure chaos mode (networking, random convos, side events, people you meet in line for bad espresso)

!!! Side events are underrated by the way. On one hand they’re great for networking, on the other they’re just mentally healthier than back-to-back pitch mode for 10 hours straight. Sometimes your best deal comes from a rooftop beer, not a meeting room with a logo wall.

That’s pretty much it.

Worst case: you get a few extra meetings Best case: you stop flying across the world just to drink hotel coffee and call it ‘strategy’

P.S Soon there’s a massive iGaming conference coming up (won’t name it so mods don’t delete this), we’re going as an agency and running this exact playbook again, so you can try as well!",1,1769617158.0,GrowthHacking,0,1.0,False

They focus on light roasts, and in my experience their coffees are extremely clean, juicy, and sometimes very sweet, with no noticeable flaws at all. I think anyone who has tried Prodigal will understand what I mean by that style.

Because of this, I’m thinking about trying something from September, but I wanted to hear your honest opinions first.

For those who have tried them for a long time:

	•	Do you recommend September Coffee Roasters?

	•	How would you describe their roasting style?

	•	Is it similar in any way to Prodigal (clean, juicy, light roast), or is it different?

Also, I brew exclusively filter coffee and sometimes soup , not a fan of the espresso world .

Based on that, would you recommend September for my brewing style?

Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences.",0,1769617058.0,pourover,6,0.4,False

My partner (27) and I (28) are moving to Wisconsin in the next few months for job opportunities. I’m in public health and my partner is a social worker. We’re queer, love art/music scenes, exploring food, don’t have kids, and have an anxious 3 year old pup. We’ve visited Milwaukee a few times in the past and love the lake, small/moderate sized city vibe, and coffee/food variety.

We’re debating between living in Milwaukee’s downtown area for easy access to the city while we’re still young and somewhat enjoying nightlife or Tosa. We have a friend that lives in the Brewer’s Hill neighborhood and she really enjoys it. There’s plenty of bus lines that seem to be able to take you to different areas so I enjoy that aspect as well. We mainly worry about crime/loud city things, lack of grass for our dog, and high prices. If there’s certain neighborhoods you’d recommend in Milwaukee, what are they and why?

We’re also thinking about Wauwatosa because it’s where my partner’s job will be (easy commute), is known to be quieter and “safer”, and seems like a cute little area. But I know nothing about Tosa and have never visited.

I know this is fully opinion based, but what is your input based on the info I provided at the top? Is Milwaukee proper all that bad or is it overhyped? Is Tosa underrated/overrated? 

For additional info, we currently live in Colorado and hate it. My partner is from Chicago and we lived in Seattle for a bit, so we’re familiar with big cities but are thinking a smaller city like Milwaukee may be a different/better vibe. We’ve also really enjoyed smaller/mid-sized towns. Our combined monthly income will probably be between $5,000 and $8,000.

1qpfq8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1qpfq8b/video_editing_on_surface_pro/,Video Editing on Surface Pro,"Hey guys! 

I bought a Surface Pro 9 on a CRAZY deal a couple years ago, it was a i5 with 8gb ram and keyboard for 500 USD, and I absolutely love that thing, except for the fact that it feels underpowered compared to my cellphone.

It's great for checking social media and watching youtube, but not really for doing anything heavy. Or kinda heavy. Well, let's just say I avoid opening more than three tabs at the same time.

I'm a full time content creator, and I often need to edit videos while traveling, so I have a laptop able to do that. The Surface Pro 9? Oh dear god no, it can barely *open* Premiere Pro, let alone render a video. So whenever I travel for work, I take my gaming laptop, whenever I travel for leisure, I take the Surface Pro. And I don't like that. I don't like that most of the time while I'm traveling for work I'm lugging a huge laptop and power brick, and I don't like that when I travel for leisure I have to commit to not make any videos and not get any work done.

A magical Surface Pro that's as small and light as mine and powerful enough to to some light video editing would be my dream device. I see that the Surface Pro 11 wasn't quite there yet because Premiere Pro didn't use to run right on ARM, but I see that now they have a native version of the Adobe suite for ARM? Is that good enough?

Mind you, I don't do crazy edits. My content is mostly 1080p talking head with some graphics overlays here and there, no crazy effects or anything, so I don't need a crazy powerful CPU. But my videos are *long*, sometimes over one hour, so the rendering process can take a while. I'm not looking to replace my desktop video editing rig, I just want to be able to do a quick touch up or maybe fix a rendering glitch from a coffee shop or hotel room!

So, how *usable* is the performance of the Surface Pro 11 with Premiere Pro currently?",1,1769616938.0,Surface,1,1.0,False

I have several sales licenses and Series 24 (https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/series24) if that means anything to anyone. 

I live & work in WI and am looking to transition to legal services. I've always wanted to go to law school, but I really want to understand what the profession looks like and give myself time to save if I end up deciding to go that route. 

**The things I like about my current job:**

\- SEC regulation is complex and ever moving, I have a good understanding of it and feel competent explaining it, even to layman although their eyes tend to glaze over😂😂

\- I SOMETIMES get to be investigative and figure out problems

\- Finagling how to phrase a certain piece of discipline to help the person understand what the rule is and why to follow it can be fun

**The things I wish I got to do more:**

\- Reading and writing

I never wanted to do data analytics. Although I appreciate a success/exception report for certain things, it seems like this is increasingly becoming just data parsing using AI and Power BO dashboards. 

The best parts of my job are reading through case notes/client meeting notes and getting and understanding of what happened and formulating questions based off what I see. I like to use language to really paint a picture and tell a story. This is a very very small part of my job

\- Talking with clients 

I pretty much only interview financial professionals to see if they're compliant or not. I would love to have to feedback showing I actually helped someone that person can see I'm competent and further trusts me/my team/the firm. 

I used to talk with clients day in and day out and as much as sometimes the conversations would drag on unnecessarily, the unnecessary meetings with compliance officers are WORSE. 

\- Case work that is open and shut

Back to the data analytics thing...it is the same pieces of discipline/education almost every single time and the places I inspect/people I interview don't change that much. It feels a little like Groundhog Day

In my former job as an AFA, I worked on a special team where all the clients whose main advisors abandoned them/didn't want them anymore ended up. The goal was to get them to close their accounts with us or pay us a crazy fee. The goal was not to maintain any type of client relationship that required a lot of work from us. I was giving advice but I was not really required to schmooze anybody. I gave competent, good financial advice and most of the clients moved on with their lives to find someone to work with long term. 

 \- Corporate theater

The people in my line of work seem to lean HEAVILY on talking about the work instead of just doing the work. I don't want to manage anybody, have any more coffee chats, or go on a goose chase for an ""initiative"" that won't last longer than a year. 

I would love to be in a more outcomes oriented environment as opposed to ""visibility"" and constant small talk.

I've had my stoma for a year and 2 months now, and in the past when I've eaten fiber, I've chewed like a cow. I steer clear of mushrooms, corn, and if I have heritage carrots, I bake them in the over until they're nicely tender. Same with chopped and quartered zucchini. With bok choy, I've minced it and boiled it in water.

But this past Monday, when I made a vegetable stir-fry of zucchini and bok choy together, well that was clearly a bridge too far! I had watery output all through the night (woke up about 7-8 times to empty my bag), and then halfway through my work day, as my small intestine is cramping and twisting under my left ribcage. Every time I stand up, the pain is there and radiates out towards my stoma. Sitting down (I work in dental, so we have to contort into odd positions to get where we need to be), the pain begins to flare worse. 

With my last patient before lunch, I lean over and there's a lance of nail-digging-jabbing pain that moves from left to right. I decide ""Yup, gotta get home!""

I rotated like a rotisserie chicken on my heating pad, drank lots of mint tea and water, even had some more black coffee to try to push this plug through. At some point during the evening/overnight, it must have worked but dang it, still up and down to the toilet to empty. Talk about the physical fatigue! I've had to call out from work today, too, which makes me mad because if I hadn't eaten the bok choy (or the vegetable stir-fry itself) I wouldn't be in this mess.

I really want to eat healthy, and I do, though when you're doing medical shift work it's nearly impossible to get the smaller meals recommended when you are on a tight turnaround. People want to be seen for their appointments. They (the patients) don't like to be kept waiting. I like being on time for my patients.

It started with his brother leaving. Not storming out, not slamming doors just walking away and saying the kind of things that stay lodged in the body long after the sound fades. The brother had been more than a sibling. He’d been a stand-in father, a fixed star. When he left, something essential went with him. The cowboy didn’t talk about it much. He just learned how to carry the weight quietly.

On the same day everything fell apart, the cowboy sent a video by accident. A dumb clip an Invincible edit, Omni-Man with bees, absurd and loud and meaningless. Or at least it should have been. It was meant for no one in particular. Certainly not for Circe.

But Circe replied.

That should have been the end of it. A brief exchange, a laugh, nothing more. Instead, it became something steady. Conversations about comic books and stupid jokes and nothing at all. About everything, sometimes. About survival, without ever naming it. The cowboy hadn’t realized how close he was to disappearing until Circe gave him a reason to stay present.

They talked every day. Not dramatically. Just consistently. For over two hundred days, there was at least one message, one tether back to the world. While grief and anger churned underneath everything else, Circe became constant. Not a savior in the grand, cinematic sense but the kind that keeps someone breathing without realizing that’s what they’re doing.

The cowboy hated being called a hero after that. He wasn’t one. Heroes save people. Heroes pull others back from ledges. The cowboy had just been trying not to fall.

Circe never knew the full weight of it. She talked. She listened. She understood jokes no one else ever seemed to get. That was enough. That was everything.

Somewhere along the way quietly, unwillingly the cowboy fell in love with her. Not the way stories usually describe it. There was no first sight, no hands brushing, no shared space at all. He didn’t even know what she looked like. The feeling crept in slowly, disguised as gratitude, admiration, relief. When he noticed it, it already felt shameful. Unfair. Circe hadn’t asked to be someone’s anchor.

Later, change came. An internship. A new city. A chance to move, to breathe somewhere else. The cowboy took it because he needed distance from the wreckage his brother had left behind. The fact that it was Circe’s city was coincidence. At least, that’s what he told himself.

He debated whether to say anything. Silence felt kinder. But honesty won out, eventually. When he told her, something shifted. Not immediately. Just enough to notice. The replies slowed. The interest thinned. The streak once effortless started to feel like obligation.

Circe mentioned a coffee bar once. Said she wanted to try it someday. The cowboy invited her. She said maybe. Then didn’t show. Later, she said she was busy. And that was when he understood.

It wasn’t rejection that hurt most. It was the fear that wanting anything at all had damaged something fragile and rare. That by existing too loudly, he had pushed away the person who had kept him alive when he didn’t know if he wanted to be.

The cowboy never blamed Circe. He never could. She was just a person. A normal one. She didn’t owe him love, or presence, or responsibility for his survival.

That was why he never told her the truth.

He carried it quietly instead: that he believed he wouldn’t be here without her, and that knowing that made him careful to the point of silence. Writing it down was the only way to honor what she had been to him without placing the weight of it in her hands.

Some heroes never know the lives they save.

I don’t get sick days and a primary parent to a young child so can’t afford illness.

1. Any issue with coffee/caffeine with the pills? Huge caffeine addict with poor sleep so caffeine is a MUST.

1. How often did you need to see a Dr while on it?

Again no time off so frequent Dr visits (more than once every 3-4 mos) is hard. If I take off I don’t get paid. Plus the cost of the visit.

These questions influence whether or not I will try it.

Still watery and still not getting up to pressure. I just tested this grinder on my home machine this morning and it worked perfectly fine. Unfortunately, I think it just has to do with the machine itself. I’ve tried descaling and back flushing it. Ive tried taking the shower screen out and cleaning that as well. I’ve tried everything that everyone has suggested to no avail. It is so confusing because it does get up to pressure when back flushing so I didn’t originally think it could be the machine itself.

In terms of an in person experience, do you prefer beans arranged by roaster or roast level? Or by roaster with signs indicating roast level etc? Any other things you either like or dislike about in store coffee beans displays?

Same question re: online shops. For example somewhere like Beanz: are there enough options to find what you want or would you prefer to search by variety of bean or processing method etc? I personally find fruity/chocolatey/caramely kind of vague categories because you could have a anaerobic processed lactic chocolate coffee for example and it would be too weird for lots of people. I do like that they have a espresso or filter/pour over option though. I also like “find your coffee” quizzes, thought the Phil & Sebastian one was really good recently:) don’t necessarily need them, but i enjoy seeing what roasters suggest & sometimes the questions are quite clever.

**NioCorp**'s **Momentum Is Real — 1,000 Strong and Growing!!**

**Big milestone today:** the NioCorp Mine Reddit community just crossed **1,000 members**. Huge credit to **Mr. N** for building, maintaining, and curating the page, and to everyone contributing research, insights, and real-time updates. This isn’t just another stock forum anymore — it’s becoming a serious knowledge hub tracking one of the most strategically important critical minerals projects in North America.

And the timing couldn’t be better. With the **Elk Creek Project advancing toward EXIM FID and anticipated ground breaking in 2026**, the broader picture is coming into focus: not just a mine, but the foundation of a **fully integrated U.S. critical minerals platform**. Niobium, scandium, titanium, rare earths — plus downstream potential in **Sc-Al alloys, magnet supply chains, defense materials, and advanced manufacturing**. This is about onshoring strategic materials the U.S. cannot afford to import anymore.

**As the community grows, so does the conviction: we’re watching the early formation of something much bigger than a single project. The buildout, the vertical integration, the partnerships, the national security relevance — this story is still in its early chapters. And this community is documenting it in real time!**

Mining might be making a big comeback in America, but it’s time to expand our imaginations about what rare-earth minerals can be — and that they might be found right in our home offices.

Electronic waste from phones, laptops and more contains high concentrations of valuable metals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, copper, gold and silver. In 2019, [discarded e-waste globally was valued at more than $57 billion](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-report-time-seize-opportunity-tackle-challenge-e-waste).

This presents an opening for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will host an inaugural Critical Minerals summit on Feb. 4 with foreign ministers from dozens of “international allies.”

The meeting aims to establish a reliable supply chain for critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and rare earth elements while reducing U.S. dependence on China, which controls roughly 70% of global production and 90% of rare-earth processing.

The inexhaustible hunt for critical minerals typically focuses on mining in regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo, South America and Greenland, and the Trump administration on Monday [announced](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/usa-rare-earth-shares-surge-report-trump-administration-investment-2026-01-26/) it would invest $1.6 billion in USA Rare Earth and help the company build a new mine in Texas that focuses on primary sources of materials.

But secondary raw materials — recycled critical minerals recovered from discarded electronics — represent an underexplored opportunity.

Rubio will likely focus on Pax Silica, the Trump administration’s initiative to secure supply chains for silicon, semiconductors, AI infrastructure and critical minerals to ease China’s dominance in these industries, as well as a revised version of the Biden-era Minerals Security Partnership that would shift the focus from climate-oriented goals to national security priorities and emphasize bilateral deal-making with resource-rich partners.

But if Rubio is serious about breaking China's grip on critical minerals, his summit should devote equal attention to building up the secondary market for recycled materials. Investing in domestic mining is necessary but insufficient—recycling infrastructure offers a faster, less geopolitically fraught path to supply chain resilience that has historically been overlooked by previous administrations.

# Why Recycling Deserves Equal Billing

The founder of Cyclic Materials, which has a recycling facility in Arizona, told the Wall Street Journal that the old gadgets people throw out every year could comprise the world’s largest “aboveground deposits” of rare-earth minerals. Besides USA Rare Earth, the federal government is also backing domestic companies such as ReElement, Vulcan Elements and MP Materials through loans, equity stakes and partnerships. Lawmakers have also proposed a new $2.5 billion agency to strengthen U.S. access to critical materials.

According to the International Energy Agency, recycling could reduce new mine development needs by 40% for copper and cobalt and by 25% for lithium and nickel by 2050.

# China’s Recycling Lead

China dominates not just primary mineral extraction and refining but also recycling infrastructure. Battery recycling capacity grew 50% year over year in 2023, and China is expected to maintain more than 70% market share in pretreatment and material recovery. Beijing has also announced a new state-owned enterprise dedicated to recycling end-of-life batteries and other materials.

# The Basel Convention Barrier

But policymakers must also address recycling efforts beyond U.S. borders.

The [Basel Convention](https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/international-agreements-transboundary-shipments-hazardous-waste), a global treaty governing hazardous waste movement across borders, shapes how e-waste is recycled worldwide. Because the U.S. is not a party to the treaty, 191 member nations are prohibited from trading controlled waste with the U.S.

American companies can obtain recycled materials from other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members such as many European Union countries, Japan and South Korea. But they cannot easily access recycled materials from non-OECD countries in Southeast Asia, Africa or South America, where much of the world's electronic scrap ends up. Without specific bilateral agreements, those countries are barred from sending waste to U.S. recycling facilities.

This puts American battery and mineral recyclers at a competitive disadvantage against recyclers in Basel member countries — including China.

# The Business Case for Recycling Critical Materials

Recycled critical minerals can strengthen corporate supply chains by reducing exposure to volatile global markets, lowering procurement costs and building resilience against geopolitical disruptions. By recovering rare earths, lithium, cobalt and nickel from end-of-life electronics, companies can supplement primary mining with a more stable, circular source of materials.

U.S. technology firms depend heavily on global recycling networks to collect discarded electronics, extract high-value minerals and process waste at lower cost than domestic alternatives. These systems help ensure steady supplies for semiconductors, batteries and advanced manufacturing when trade restrictions, export controls or price shocks strain primary sources — allowing companies to manage costs and stay competitive.

Restrictions on cross-border e-waste movement will be actively debated at the Basel Convention in 2026, and U.S. companies have a direct stake in the outcome. Technology, battery and manufacturing firms rely on global recycling networks to recover critical materials at scale—often more cheaply and reliably than through primary mining alone. Continued U.S. engagement is essential to ensure American companies are not locked out of secondary material flows while competitors, including China, gain ground.

For the Rubio summit to be successful in breaking China’s grip on critical minerals, recycling cannot be an afterthought. Bringing recycled critical materials into the discussion would give U.S. companies faster, cheaper and more resilient access to key inputs—while reducing geopolitical risk. Mining matters, but recycling is the quickest way to strengthen supply chains now.

# Jan. 27th, 2026~ NioCorp (NASDAQ:NB) - H1/26 Financing with Strong US Government Support (PLUS TRANSCRIPT**)

[NioCorp (NASDAQ:NB) - H1/26 Financing with Strong US Government Support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQH67NFsy8c)

# I'm Thinking~ 🚨 The U.S. Is Buying the Supply Chain — NioCorp Is About to Be Repriced!

January 27th didn’t come with fireworks, but it may go down as the moment U.S. critical-minerals policy crossed a point of no return. With Washington now openly taking equity positions in strategic materials companies, the signal is unmistakable: these assets are being reclassified from “commodities” to **national infrastructure**. That shift reframes NioCorp entirely. Elk Creek isn’t waiting for policy to catch up — it already fits the model the government is actively moving toward.

Mark Smith’s back-to-back interviews (RedChip and Crux) confirmed that NioCorp is no longer talking about potential, but executing on milestones. The company raised **$370 million in 2025**, still holds **over $300 million in cash**, and has board approval for **$45 million in early construction**, with portal work beginning **around February 1**.

# That is real capital moving into real ground. Companies do not accelerate underground development unless they believe financing is coming. Smith was explicit: EXIM engagement has intensified dramatically, and binding news could arrive as early as Q2 2026!!

**The timeline is no longer vague:** **February** marks the beginning of physical construction and is widely expected to coincide with meaningful progress on the **scandium metal and Scandium-Aluminum (ScAl) alloy pathway** tied to DoD priorities, Lockheed engagement, and the NAMA ecosystem. **This is the piece the market still doesn’t grasp. Scandium isn’t just a byproduct — it is the key that unlocks aerospace-grade alloys, margin expansion, and customer dependency. For decades, industry was stuck in a loop: no supply meant no demand, no demand meant no supply. NioCorp is now breaking that loop by building both simultaneously.**

[The \\""Chicken-and-Egg problem froze the entire sector.\\"" NioCorp just broke it!!! \*\*\*I speculate\~ LOCKHEED & the DOD want it NOW at SCALE!!!](https://reddit.com/link/1qpf77o/video/5ldizido14gg1/player)

* ***We can’t design with Sc-Al alloys without reliable supply.”***
* ***“We can’t build supply without guaranteed demand.”***
* ***That chicken-and-egg problem froze the entire sector. NioCorp just broke it!!!***
* ***With the launch of NAMA, the acquisition of FEA’s IP, work on scandium-aluminum master alloys, and engagement with defense-adjacent partners,***
* ***NioCorp is no longer positioning itself as a seller of oxide — but as a producer of engineered materials. That moves them up the value chain into margins, lock-in, and strategic relevance.***

Then comes **March**, when the updated **feasibility study (DFS)** is expected to drop mid-to-late month. This version incorporates a new process flow sheet, updated engineering, and rare earth contributions priced at non-Chinese levels. Smith stated clearly that while capex may rise, revenues rise more — with approximately **$700 of payable metals per ton of ore against $225–250 in processing costs**. That DFS is not just a technical update; it is the document that underpins offtake, financing, valuation, and institutional credibility.

But the real story extends beyond mining economics. What yesterday’s interviews quietly confirmed is that NioCorp is architecting something much broader: a **vertically integrated critical materials platform**. The flowsheet supports rare earth separation. The scandium pathway supports advanced alloy manufacturing. The mine-to-magnet vision naturally enables **future magnet recycling and circular supply chains**. While policymakers debate mining versus recycling, NioCorp has already designed for both. That positions Elk Creek not as a single-asset mine, but as a hub capable of hosting downstream processing, advanced materials production, and eventually secondary feedstock loops aligned with DoD, OEM, and national security mandates.

This is the strategic asymmetry the market continues to miss. Most miners are price-takers with one product and one risk profile. NioCorp is building an ecosystem: niobium, scandium, titanium, magnet rare earths, advanced alloys, offtake relationships, federal partnerships, and potential recycling integration. That is exactly the type of asset Washington ends up funding, fast-tracking, and protecting once the importance becomes undeniable. The precedent has already been set.

The market still prices NioCorp like a speculative development-stage miner. The trajectory now looks very different: early construction underway, DFS imminent, offtakes expected, EXIM negotiations accelerating, and policy tailwinds strengthening by the week. Elk Creek is not evolving into “a mine.” It is evolving into a **cornerstone of U.S. materials sovereignty**. And once that recognition becomes widespread, the repricing won’t be gradual — it will be structural.

# 💥 PLUS- Mark Smith Just Telegraphed the Real Scale of Elk Creek — and the Market Still Isn’t Listening

In the Crux interview, Smith casually revealed the math most investors haven’t processed yet: **\~1 million tons of ore per year, roughly $700 per ton in payable metals, and only $225–250 per ton in processing costs** — implying **$450–500 per ton in operating margin**. That’s **$450–500 million in potential annual operating margin** at steady-state, *before* the updated rare earth contribution is fully baked into the March DFS. **Smith explicitly said REEs will “meaningfully enhance economics” under non-Chinese pricing, meaning the revenue side is likely to rise, not fall. That’s not hype — that’s the CEO quietly signaling the scale of what’s coming!**

**IMHO\~** What most people still aren’t grasping is the sheer scale already being implied — We might potentially be looking at **$700–800 million+ in annual revenues at steady-state from the mine alone!!!**, based on management’s own throughput and payable metal commentary, **before** you layer in any upside from scandium-aluminum alloy vertical integration, downstream processing, or future recycling loops. **That’s just the base case!**

The ScAl pathway, DoD-aligned materials strategy, and potential engineered products represent **entirely separate revenue streams** that aren’t reflected in today’s models. **The market is still pricing NioCorp as a small developer. Eventually, when execution milestones stack up — portal construction, DFS, offtakes, financing — investors won’t be debating potential anymore. They’ll be forced to price in scale.**

[ALL Aboard!  Full Speed Ahead!....](https://reddit.com/link/1qpf77o/video/4u4rhojf34gg1/player)

**Waiting for more material news as it becomes available!** The upcoming February ScAl alloy reveal with Lockheed and the DoD could be the moment NioCorp stops being viewed as a miner and starts being recognized as **a classified-tier defense materials supplier hiding in plain sight**!

My Answer and Base Building Advice.,"This was something I asked myself a lot when I was getting started, how big of a base did I really need?  What size rooms should I be planning to try and future proof for future needs?  Well, thought I'd take a moment to sit back and help the next generation that Googles this question!

*Note: This is my opinion and is what I do.  If you want to go bigger, you are free to!  I wouldn't recommend going much smaller though.*

**Bedroom(s): 3x3**  
You get an increasingly hefty bonus to xp for sleeping at night, and you increase that bonus by having lots of decorations up.  Now, depending on if you're playing solo or on a server will dictate how many bedrooms you have.  You should always have at least one.

My bedrooms are 3x3 tiles.  Thats big enough for a fireplace on the back wall, one to two beds in one tile over in a corner, and then plenty of room for nightstands, table and chair, dresser, wardrobe, and bookshelf.  Also lots of wall space for trophy mounts.

You can make just a large barracks if you want because you have a lot of people on the server, but I prefer bedrooms.  Especially on servers, just minimal decorations in each room add up to a high cozy score really fast without you having to cram a bunch of stuff in every available nook and cranny so that it looks cluttered.

**Primary Workshop: 3x4**  
This will be plenty of room for all your work benches early on so that grabbing stuff from one to use in another (like grabbing refined wood from your carpentry bench to use in your decoration bench) is quick and easy.  Later on, the back wall being 2 tiles high in the center will give you enough room for the massive Foundry bench with room on the sides for furnaces.  I personally use an electric and keep a concrete furnace for overflow.  Then you have room for things like your masonry bench, your carpentry table, your cement mixer, etc.

Early on, this is your everything room.  Later on, it becomes your heavy construction workshop.

**Storage/Secondary Workshop: 3x4**  
Same size as your primary workshop.  It should be big enough for you to put 5 cupboards lined up across each short wall end, and 6 trunks in the middle of the floor, 3x2, with enough space to get around them.  Make some signs and label each one of these as a different primary resource, like Iron/Copper/Steel/Fur/Leather/Silica/etc.  Leave the long walls open.

Let me stress this now, no matter how much you think you are struggling to get the resources you need early on, later you will be SWIMMING in them.  Tons of storage space is a necessity.  Just plan for it and build it now and get used to your layout.  Early on, this is the only thing you'll use this room for.  Later on, you'll be moving some of your secondary workbenches in here as well as your primary workshop fills up.  I put things like my decorations bench, my trophy bench, my fishing bench, etc. in here.  Even my alteration bench and my textiles bench!

I like to connect this room directly to the workshop to make grabbing materials easier.

**Kitchen/Livingroom Greatroom: 3x7**  
This is a glorified hallway that all the previous rooms connect to via doorways.  I put the kitchen on one far side.  3 tiles there means a big stone/brick fireplace for cooking early on in the middle tile against the back wall with a tile on either side for later on when you start getting into the kitchen blocks.  Also gives plenty of room on the sides for stuff like your salting station, your skinning bench, your icebox, etc. while still putting a dining room table and chairs in the middle.

On the other end, you can put couches, coffee tables, and your ""Oops, I need this right now!"" stuff like your oxidizer and water purifier near the front door.

This room may feel redundant because other than the kitchen benches all that furniture doesn't really *do* anything, but thats not really true.  For one, it makes the base look like a house so it feels better to be in, but more importantly those are a lot of decorations that will up your comfy score, and lots of long walls for mounting trophies on.

**Greenhouse: 4x5**  
Really you can't make this big enough, but this will give you plenty of space for your essentials.  Generally speaking I don't make any single structure more than 4 tiles wide simply because of how tall they become, they look rather silly to me.  Plus you run into stability issues trying to span larger rooms.  Make sure to leave an open spot for a beehive!

And yes, go ahead and lay out the foundations for this early on, even when you know its going to be a while before you can actually build it.  Better to work it into your design early on than to scramble later trying to make it fit with everything else that sprang up as you went.

**Stable: 2x4 > 4x5**  
This is going to depend a lot on how many people are in the game with you, and how much you want to tame.  At the smallest, I make mine 2x4 tiles with a double door in the middle of one of the long walls.  This is enough room for the ranching table, a couple of small sheltered feed troughs, and 2-3 pet beds.  Watering troughs go outside to collect rain.  This is fine for Olympus where a deterrent will keep your animals safe, or even on Prometheus if you've built a spiked palisade around your base.  If you aren't wanting to go to that much effort, build it bigger so that you can close your mounts up so wildlife can't get to them.

And there you go, that base should be enough to keep you going from digging up rocks with your bare hands all the way up to running great hunts in composite armor!

**Tips for a better looking base, for ease of upgrades later on:**

First off, as soon as you land, build yourself a little survival hut off to the side somewhere.  This is temporary, because its gonna be a while before you're in your pretty perma-base.  But the more time you put into it early on, the better off you will be for the rest of the game, so take it slow and deliberate!

0) Before you start anything else, get a good spot to build on!  Things to look for are relatively flat, open ground.  Flat is the most important part, because the flatter it is the less work you will have to put into making it flat.  As open of a spot as you can start out with helps later on when there's a big game update that resets the map.  If you hacked a clearing out of a deep forest, one day you WILL wake up to that forest having magically regrown inside your house, and nobody wants that.  The less clearing you have to do, the better!  Also, make sure you are near water.  Not just a pond or a lake, try to be near a stream.  Early on, running out to fill your waterskin up from the purifier is a hassle, make that run as short as possible.  Later on, waterwheels are the best and easiest way to get an early jump on electricity.  Not only do you not want to run wires across half the map, those waterwheels require constant cleaning out or they stop working, so make the run as short as possible.

1) Get your shovel out, and make dirt foundations.  Foundations are ALWAYS better than not having foundations, even if they're just dirt.  The trick here is that you only need those foundations under your walls.  As such, its also a great way to lay your base out early on.  Find a spot where you want to make your full sized compound, make some dirt foundations, and lay out the exteriors of the rooms.  You want to start with your 3x3 bedroom?  Make a 3x3 set of foundations (with the middle area being open, we'll get to that later).  Remember, if you find that the land isn't as flat as you thought, you can pick your foundations back up with Y and lay them back out.  Don't get frustrated if you have to change your location or where you start your foundations multiple times to get everything flat, it happens to the best of us!  Plan out your *entire house* this way before you do anything else.

2) Leave the interiors of rooms without foundations.  Foundations support weight, so you want them under your walls.  You don't need them under the flooring though.  If your space in the middle is particularly large, put some posts in there to hold the floor up, but for a 3 tile wide floor with foundation on the 2 outside tiles?  That middle floor can float just fine.  There are two reasons to do this.  First off, it saves you time and effort having to make a ton of foundations.  Cutting that amount you need in half is always a good thing, especially later on when you're upgrading them.  Less expensive new foundations you have to make, the better!  Secondly, later on you will get electrical wiring and plumbing that you need to install that will have pipes and wires going EVERYWHERE.  If your foundation is hollow under the house, you can run those pipes and wires under your floor in a kind of crawlspace.  Just pick the floors up with Y, run your stuff around the edges of each room, run some connection points up through the foundations and onto the bottoms of your walls like real life electrical outlets, and then seal your floor back up.  Now all your wires and pipes are hidden out of sight and your base will look MUCH cleaner!  Also, when you're having to run power or pipes along the outside of the house, run them along the sides of the foundation.  Then later when you've gotten everything upgraded, make some wall pieces and cover the foundations up, which will cover up your exterior wiring as well!

3) Line everything with supports!  They not only will help later on when you switch to heavier materials, they will make your build more visually interesting as well.  Your 3x3 rooms?  Vertical posts in each corner, and then horizontal posts running around the tops of the wall tiles under your roofing.  Again visually this will make it look like you framed your house out and will make even boring little boxes look nicer, and later on it will go a long way to supporting heavier roofs that were fine when made of wood, but can get dicey when switched to stone or brick.

4) Upgrade as you go with the repair hammer.  Go ahead and build this magnificent mansion of yours out in wood early on, its fine.  Then when you can upgrade to stone, make your replacement parts, put them in your inventory, pull out your repair hammer, and hold down R.  That brings up the selection wheel.  Pick the material you want to upgrade to (that you have the pieces of in your inventory already).  Now right click on things to upgrade them without having to tear anything down first.  Do this every time you get access to stronger materials.  Upgrade that wood to stone ASAP so you can stop worrying about storms.  Upgrade the stone to brick or concrete once those become an option.  Upgrade your foundations too, the fact that you only put them under the walls means you should be able to access almost all of them from the outside, making even upgrading your foundations quick and easy.  Don't be afraid to build big with inferior materials early on!

5) Aesthetics to Layout.  I like to make mini-corridors between rooms.  I have my big central hall that is 2 full wall tiles high, with the roof above that.  To get to the next room, I put a single tile between them.  Doorway wall on each end of that mini-hall tile.  The reason I do this?  The 2 tile tall central hall with a 3 tile wide room on the other end means you can cap the hallway off with just a single /\ roof piece that butts up to flat walls on either side (because the 3x3 wall is 2 tiles high in the middle).  From the outside, this breaks your giant box of a house up into a more connected looking multi-room compound that is just really nice looking (IMO).  Then I put leather or cloth curtain doors in the doorways to the great hall so that they have some privacy without having to stop and open/close a solid door (just run right through!).

6) Don't forget the windows!  No, they don't really serve any purpose, and early on you're gonna be keeping those chonky wooden shutters closed all the time so you can't even see out of them.  But later you'll be replacing them with glass, and it just makes the place feel better from both the inside and the outside.  I try to keep 1 window looking out of each bedroom, a window on either side of the front door, a window in the kitchen, and a window or two in the workrooms.  Again, they aren't functionally required, and they don't really even add to your cozy score, but they're nice.  Make some leather curtains to go over them and open the curtains up, and its just a pretty little detail.  Remember, your goal is to surthrive.  And nothing says surthriving like making strawberry jam in your kitchen while looking out the window past your curtains at the sunrise!

7) Also don't forget to improve the terrain outside of and around your base!  Build bridges over streams so you aren't having to swim or get stuck in there where you can't easily get out.  Build staircases up nearby cliffs.  If you do fishing, build a pier out into the water, the better fish are usually in the deeper sections you can't reach from shore.  Just run around, do your stuff, and any time you find yourself thinking ""This is so annoying"" while trying to get around a landscape feature, go build some stone pieces and build a way over/around the obstacle.  That trip going 10 miles around a cliff to get to your cave or deep mine node can become a short skip and a hop if you have a staircase!  If you have to swim for 5 minutes to reach something, just build a walkway over the water.  30 minutes now to save 5 minutes later sounds like a bad deal until you realize how many times you're going to make that 5 minute detour for the rest of the save!",4,1769615746.0,ICARUS,5,1.0,False

## When Adults Pick Up the Crayons Again 🖍️✨  

Let’s be real — adulting is basically juggling deadlines, bills, and an emotional support water bottle. Somewhere between grocery lists and email chains, we forgot what it feels like to just *color outside the lines.*  

I used to think coloring was only for kids — until I tried an adult coloring book during one of the most stressful weeks of my life. Ten minutes in, my thoughts slowed down. My breathing shifted. The noise of “shoulds” and “musts” disappeared into shades of emerald and rose.  

That’s when it hit me: coloring isn’t childish. It’s meditative art therapy disguised as fun.  

Here’s what I’ve learned (and what science backs up too):  
• Repetitive creative motions (like coloring) calm the amygdala — the brain’s stress hub.  
• Choosing colors strengthens focus and gives the dopamine boost you get from small wins.  
• You don’t have to “be artistic” — you just have to *start.*  

That inspiration led me to curate something special: a printable **Coloring Book for Adults PDF** that’s perfectly designed for unwinding anywhere, anytime. Mandalas, nature scapes, mindful patterns — all ready to print and fill with color.

Howdy, I made a post about a week-ish ago about an incident I had with the religious medic. I got let go, with the option to just resign. Reason being was dozing while driving...I didn't pull over because I assumed the ""figure it out "" position. Sucks to suck, get through it thing. Like what I should be doing when someone is actively dying and I'm fighting for my life trying to untangle the leads. You do it, and figure it out. 

I sure did mess up there. I know. With the extent of the incident the same day though with the altercation I wonder if that was just a cushion to let go of the trouble maker in the face of someone with a long history of just being the way they are. I didn't get to hear if it was resolved. I'm just gone.

Owning up to this I will say, nobody got hurt. Yes they could have. It kills. Now I've tried coffee, an energy drink, caffeine gum. This was a single isolated incident. I was progressing fine through my training but alas didn't last a month. On top of that I do work a second job. I wasn't sleeping well due to that.

So I did screw up, and I'm mad that I got let go within 3 weeks of starting a journey I was so excited for. 

How do you wake your ass up when odds else? Should I take time Way and get back to it later...I can't work for that company again. I can't afford just EMS. I need two incomes if I want to make it somewhere. 

I'm a phlebotomist now. Love it. Should I switch to ER tech to get my shit together? Lot of questions! I don't know I've never been let go before.",1,1769615639.0,NewToEMS,0,0.67,False

We wanted to get married for our 30th birthday but didn't have time to plan a very big party so we did a ""small"" ceremony with our parents, sisters, brothers, their spouces, their kids (7 kids) and some really close friends. We were 25 pleople present. We chose the 3rd of january in order for my sister to be here (she lives on another continent). Considering some guests had to come a long way, we wanted to have a whole day of activities to have quality time with everyone. So we told (by message) all our guests that in the morning will be the official wedding (in city hall), then we invite (and pay) them in the restaurant and in the afternoon we go on a game of tresor hunt close to our appartement and the restaurant, before having tea or coffee at our appartment to close the day (and warm each other). I wanted everybody to have a great time so I worked hard to make the game interresting for adults and kids and spent quite a lot of time and money buying small gifts to fill the tresor chest. In the week before the wedding, my family demanded a few things (inclusion of their dogs, adjustment of menu) and I made it possible. 2 days before the wedding, my fiance and I went to my mother's to celebrate christmas with my whole family. No one asked anything, so I supposed everything was ok. The evening before the wedding, we sent everyone a message repeating all the informations, and the loose schedule of the day of the wedding, emphasizing the need of confortable shoes for the game. On the day of the wedding, everything went fine until the end of the meal when my mother tells me that herself, my brother, his spouse, my sister and their kids (total of 4 adults and 4 kids) are leaving so that  the kids can be rested for school on monday (my brother and his family has 5 hours to go back home) or go see spend time with their dad (in my sister's case, she is divorced). I was really shocked so I then asked my mother why they didn't say this sooner and she said that they didn't understand that the tresor hunt was for all and that they didn't plan to partake. I then said (loudly but not screaming) that them leaving was disrespectful of my partner and me. My mother and my sister then flipped out that I can't yell at them in public, that I am ungrateful for the effort they put to be here, that I shouldn't expect them to do what was planned, and that I have no reason to be mad and shoudn't blame them for my disappointment as they were NOT disrespectful to me.

I wanted to practice languages with real people in my city — not just chat online, but actually meet up, grab a coffee, and practice together. But almost every language exchange app I tried put this feature behind a paywall.

Instead of complaining, I decided to build LingoRadar — a free language exchange app that helps you connect with people near you who speak the language you want to learn.

I worked on it in my free time and got it live on the Apple App Store after a couple of months.

**Small wins so far**

* 10 ratings worldwide
* Average rating of 5.0 stars
* Currently #4 in “Language Exchange” in the IOS App Store (Germany)

Not huge numbers, but motivating for a solo side project next to my full time job.

**What I’d love feedback on**

* If this is still a prototype, where would you focus next?
* Would you use this instead of bigger apps like HelloTalk or Tandem with paywalls? Why or why not?
* Any ideas on early user growth?

1qpes7h,https://i.redd.it/2b2aiu7804gg1.jpeg,Vegetarian anti-wank chervil soup - from 1897,"This Vegetarian Chervil Soup from 1897 is from a recipe book from the Dutch Vegetarians Society (*De Nederlandschen Vegetariërs-Bond*).

On 30 September 1894 this Dutch Vegetarians Society was founded, and it still exists today. Vegetarianism looked very different back then, then it does now.

It was inspired by the [Vegetarian Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_Society) founded in the United Kingdom.

Vegetarian Societies in the 19th century were heavily influenced by religion. Most often Christian branches that believed in temperance. A lot of ideas how to live “pure” were inspired by Buddhist monks visited by doctors and Christian pilgrims and/or missionaries. These ideas fit well with the Christian branches of religion that believe in a plain and simple life and humility to please God. For example many Protestant branches like the seventh-day adventists that Dr. John Harvey Kellog was a member off. He created his famous Kellog’s anti-wank cereals as part of late 19th century vegetarianism ideals.

The first members were doctors that believed eating meat-free was the healthiest diet, Christian religious leaders that believed it was spiritually the most healthy diet and people that just did not like hurting animals.

Members were often also member of; total absence societies (teetotallers a.k.a. people that do not drink alcohol) and anti-tobacco societies. Also groups regarding diverse Christian divisions, socialism, anarchism, women’s emancipation, antimilitarism, naturism, mysticism, neo-Buddhism and esperantism.

The vegetarian diet was also often used to try to prevent or cure indigestion, cancer, tuberculosis, ADHD, eczema, asthma, anaemia, diabetes and many other illnesses and bodily inconveniences. It promised living to an old age and easy births.

This lead to a bunch of rules and visions that we might frown upon today.

# The rules of the vegetarian diet in 1897.

The following ingredients and actions are named by the Dutch Vegetarian Society to “maim your organs”:

*Meat (also fish), alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, ice cream and sorbet or anything frozen, soup, leaving less than 5 hours between meals, eggs, milk, salt, morphine, butter, nutmeg, mace, letting the neighbours smell what you are cooking.* W*hite pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, lombok pepper, Spanish pepper, ginger, mustard, vinegar, cinnamon, cumin, cloves, baking powder, bitter almonds, rowan berry’s, vanilla, all oils, sugar, syrup, figs, raisins, currants, drinking during a meal and finally fresh bread.*

The reason so many spices and salt and sweet products were forbidden is because the Christian protestant influence saw anything tasty as a gateway drug for worse sins. You start with a pinch of Himalayan pink salt and before you know it you are doing bath salts. A little bit of black pepper and BOOM! the kids are doing black tar heroine.

Everything that is enjoyable: tasty food, art, fashion, dancing, music, alcohol, drugs, make-up, games, fantasy books and movies, etc. can eventually lead to the worst sin of all: **lust, the sin of the flesh**.

# The visions of the vegetarian diet in 1897.

These following visions are found in their books and leaflets. They explain a lot of the thought process about the ingredients that you are not allowed to consume as a vegetarian:

“*Spices contain poisons that cause temporary and chronic illnesses.*“

“*Humans, our instincts and our sense of smell are rotten due to flawed science (all science is flawed) false cookery and the slow-wittedness of most humans.*“

“*Parents force children to swallow food and drinks they are naturally disgusted by. If these children grow up they yearn for stimulants like cigars and alcohol.”*

“*Meat, even from an healthy animal, contains poison. Butchered animals are noticeably decomposing; but we can’t smell the decomposing cadaver because of our rotten sense of smell.*“

“*More and more mothers can’t wean their baby’s because they eat meat, milks, eggs and broth.*“

“*It is proven that salt is poison because when you drink one glass of water with 1 tablespoon of salt you get sick and need to puke.”*

“*If there did not excist salt, cancer would not excist****.”***

“*Vinegar makes women less able to wean their baby’s, and if young girls consume vinegar it ruins their most precious virgin blossoming****.”***

“*It is normal to have pain and a fever when you start a vegetarian diet.”*

“*People who convert to a vegetarian diet and fail or cheat, harm the vegetarian community in the most worst way possible.*“

“*Spanish and German vegetarians are not allowed in the community because they want to use the vegetarian diet to create vegetarian colonies to breed a vegetarian master race.”*

So yeah.. they sound fun at parties. Some of their visions definitely give vegetarians/vegans a bad name today, and also in their own time.

# Ingredients

* 1 liter Buttermilk
* 50 gram Raisins
* 50 gram Currants
* 1 hand of crushed Oats or Oatmeal
* 2 hands of chopped Chervil
* 1 tablespoon Sugar

# Directions

* Cook the raisins and currants for 10 minutes in the buttermilk.
* Add the oats and cook for another 5 minutes.
* Add the chervil and the sugar, and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
* Done! Time to enjoy this feast!

I will never make this again and I would have absolutely not survived being a vegetarian in the 19th century. I would be bored to tears and become one of those “most hurtful” cheaters that yearns for alcohol and cigars and lusts after the sins of the flesh. So basically end up who I am today lol.

All sorts of different coffees: Hydrangea, Rising Star, ModCup, B&W.  The primary note I'm getting from almost everything (looking back over my notes the past month in Beanconqueror) is tealike.  Some fruitiness, some acidity, some other stuff in there if I look for it.  But everything definitely has a pretty strong tea character.    
  
I don't know if it's in my head or for real.  Or even if it was always like this, and I'm just noticing now.

Maddeningly, as much time as I've spent in here (and as much $ as I've spent on beans and gear), I'm not even sure if these flavors mean I'm going under or over on extraction.  Which makes me feel like a moron.  How can I not know that?  And how do I tell the difference?

Hello!

My husband got me a DeLonghi Stilosa Manual machine for Christmas. We are pretty low income so this was a big investment financially for us at the time and something he was incredibly proud to gift me. I want to appreciate the thoughtfulness of this gift by getting the most out of it 🥺💜 I’ve been watching YouTube tutorials and reading this Reddit and wiki but something’s still elude me.

I’ve never been a barista and am going in maybe even below novice level of understanding. Apologies for incorrect terminology or flare!

I do not have any fancy equipment besides a very basic coffee grinder, the plastic tamper it came with, the single or double baskets it came with and a small little metal poker it came with. I’ve just been using our regular kitchen scale and my watch and poor judgement.

I do want to get better accessory equipment but it’s one of those, in a few paychecks situations.

So I’ve been doing about 16g of coffee and that pours around 20-25 seconds. The grinder doesn’t have options for how fine (it seems), just how long it grinds time wise, so I’ve been doing the longest time setting (30 seconds.) The portafilter (?) it came with does not sit level on a table, so I really struggle to evenly tampering. I had to cut a couple pieces of cardboard and tape them together and use a leveler to find a way that it rests level and flat. Maybe there is a better way?

The portafilter (?) has two spouts, and no matter which position I tamper or how I put the espresso in, it always comes out the left spout only. It doesn’t splash thankfully. When I tried to put more coffee in the basket, grounds would get stuck to the top of the machine and overflow. When I tried to put less coffee in the basket, the pucks became VERY soggy and wet.

I don’t expect my shots to ever be perfect given the circumstances, and the coffee does taste \~good\~, I think? There is very little “crema” from what I can tell. Can any experts help a wife who just wants to make her husband proud?

\* I read online someone said Costco will grind coffee for you if you need finer grounds. Has anyone tried that?

\* what about a puck screen or whatever it’s called?

\* is my machine just going to always go to the left and that’s okay? Or is there something repair/mechanical I should be doing like tightening something or loosening something?

(I am aware some of you are going to say ""why dont you focus on getting more commercial contracts"" and that's not the advice I am looking for.

The Technology:  I am looking at purchasing a Microbial Imaging device (used in food manufacturing to prevent outbreaks like Listeria).  It visually identifies Microbial biofilms (mold, bacteria, fungi, yeast, viruses) in real-time.  Essentially, it sees the biological colonies that standard cleaning and ATP swabbing miss

The problem it solves:  Most businesses (surgery centers, Dr. offices, daycares, gyms, Senior living facilities) simply rely on a visual clean or ATP swabs that are random spot tests.  This leaves massive blind spots when it comes to contagions and other nasty things that can be spread around.

The Business Model:  Use this device as an independent auditor.  Build a brand around being ""clean verified"". 

How the service works:  A scan on your business facilities.  This scan can reveal many potential hotspots for things such as E. coli on a coffee pot handle that is making employees sick,  mold on the carpet that is making a room smell ""musty"", a lingering virus in the customer waiting area of a Dr. office.  We are then able to ATP swab the areas and find out what it is, why it was missed and have a plan to remediate in the future.

This can be setup as a one time audit, maybe as a re-active situation, but would best work to be a pro-active monthly service.

Deliverables:  A report with pictures and details of biofilm found. An action plan, maybe updated cleaning SOP's if that's what needs to be fixed, and a badge on your front door claiming your facilities to be ""verified clean"".  

The pitch: I am thinking of a ""no-find, no -fee"" model.  If i scan the facility and find nothing (a near impossible task), the client pays nothing.  If I find a biofilm, they pay for the audit and corrective action plan.  

The logic behind this is simple: I don't like to work for free so I am going to look.  This should keep the facilities on their toes.  I am basically providing a risk mitigation service to facilities that cannot risk a bad outbreak or infection.  

Other implications this business model has:

Helping businesses fix issues of 1 star reviews due to clean complaints, the data showing what may be spreading around town, reducing employee sick days and plenty more.

My questions for you:

As a business owner, would this be something you would like at your facilities at a good price (priced at around $200, less than the cost of a sick day)?

As a consumer would you like to see this service in the businesses you visit?

I’m Iris, I’m 27 and I work in dance as well as a personal assistant and e-commerce business owner (I stay busy lol) I’m originally from Germany and lived in South Carolina before moving to the city a year ago

I love to read, go out dancing, travel, ski, explore new places and hobbies, and I’m always down for a karaoke night.

My sweet cat Binx is snuggly and very playful. He has lived with all kinds of cats and dogs, so if you have a furry friend he’s a great companion.

1qpelg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qpelg9/looking_for_advice/,Looking for advice.,"I am looking for advice on a new business model.  I am considering a pivot from my current commercial cleaning business into ""cleaning audits"" at a Microbial level and want to know your advice.

(I am aware some of you are going to say ""why dont you focus on getting more commercial contracts"" and that's not the advice I am looking for.

The Technology:  I am looking at purchasing a Microbial Imaging device (used in food manufacturing to prevent outbreaks like Listeria).  It visually identifies Microbial biofilms (mold, bacteria, fungi, yeast, viruses) in real-time.  Essentially, it sees the biological colonies that standard cleaning and ATP swabbing miss

The problem it solves:  Most businesses (surgery centers, Dr. offices, daycares, gyms, Senior living facilities) simply rely on a visual clean or ATP swabs that are random spot tests.  This leaves massive blind spots when it comes to contagions and other nasty things that can be spread around.

The Business Model:  Use this device as an independent auditor.  Build a brand around being ""clean verified"". 

How the service works:  A scan on your business facilities.  This scan can reveal many potential hotspots for things such as E. coli on a coffee pot handle that is making employees sick,  mold on the carpet that is making a room smell ""musty"", a lingering virus in the customer waiting area of a Dr. office.  We are then able to ATP swab the areas and find out what it is, why it was missed and have a plan to remediate in the future.

This can be setup as a one time audit, maybe as a re-active situation, but would best work to be a pro-active monthly service.

Deliverables:  A report with pictures and details of biofilm found. An action plan, maybe updated cleaning SOP's if that's what needs to be fixed, and a badge on your front door claiming your facilities to be ""verified clean"".  

The pitch: I am thinking of a ""no-find, no -fee"" model.  If i scan the facility and find nothing (a near impossible task), the client pays nothing.  If I find a biofilm, they pay for the audit and corrective action plan.  

The logic behind this is simple: I don't like to work for free so I am going to look.  This should keep the facilities on their toes.  I am basically providing a risk mitigation service to facilities that cannot risk a bad outbreak or infection.  

Other implications this business model has:

Helping businesses fix issues of 1 star reviews due to clean complaints, the data showing what may be spreading around town, reducing employee sick days and plenty more.

My questions for you:

As a business owner, would this be something you would like at your facilities at a good price (priced at around $200, less than the cost of a sick day)?

As a consumer would you like to see this service in the businesses you visit?  

What is the biggest blind spot you see in this model? 

Do you feel this is a solid ROI business model?

A few intermittent breaks here and there, but no more than 3-4 days, usually when traveling.  But I've been gradually increasing the intensity of my routines and bulking up more over Winter.

This past weekend I was traveling for work with my company to a franchise show in New Jersey.  Got stuck there for 5 days because of the weather, and the company guys I was with....well they like to party, HARD.  I seldom drink anymore, and have a pretty strict diet.  Well, it goes without saying that it got completely thrown out the window the past 4-5 days.  I was up late every night, drinking, eating whatever.  I felt like I was in college again.

I was so fed up with the travel delays, at the airport getting ready to come home I had a couple of Old Fashioneds and a big ol' slice of New York pizza before I got on the plane.

About halfway through the flight, I started to feel warm, so I took my jacket and long-sleeve outer shirt off.  I started sweating profusely and feeling like I was gonna pass out.  Thankfully I had a set of two seats to myself and I sort of just curled up and laid down for a minute.  I then ran to the lavatory and took a massive shit, returned to my seat afterward, and just started to level out a bit.

It got me thinking back to what I'd had to eat and drink that day, and I realized I hadn't had virtually any water.  Not only that day, but very little the past 3-4 days, just coffee and booze.  I'm positive I was dehydrated AF!

Tl;dr: for the caffeine lovers how do you work it into your day around meds? Any side effects or none? Best timing? With food? 

  
So my husband leaves me a coffee when he goes to work at 630am. It's one of the highlights of my day and helps get me out of bed before my kids. A coffee in a quiet dark house is a real treat. 

  
I'm also 20 years into this habit so kicking it will be difficult. I realize zero people would suggest starting the day with a coffee as any kind of good habit to have. But here I am and it brings me joy. 

  
But I'm realizing maybe having a coffee in my system could potentially have side effects? My dose is low compared to many (20mg dex) but still. 

Have I felt side effects? No but I'm still semi irregular. Sometimes with food later like 9am, sometimes I forget, sometimes first thing. Sometimes I skip my afternoon coffee, sometimes I don't. I haven't spotted a pattern yet But I do feel like there are days the meds do nothing. 

  
 could I be making meds less effective? 



Options: 

1 - wait to take my meds but hard to push through the morning 

  
2 - chug protein before the coffee and meds

  
3 - take my meds while still in bed and give them 15 minutes in an empty stomach. Then dump coffee on top. 

  
4 - have my husband make me decaf and save the caffeine for later in the day

1.) Coffee Lip Balm from Summer Friday 

2.) Pearl Liquid Highlight from Iconic London

3.) Fairy from Soft Glam Palette 

4.) Romantic Heroine Eyeliner from MQN

5.) Dusty Mauve from Soft Glam Palette 

6.) Peachy Orange color that I have from a Colour Pop palette.

I have 6 month twins and we’ve been dealing with frequent night wakes (every 45–60 minutes) for months. They often wake screaming and need help settling back to sleep. This happens even when the schedule seems appropriate. My daughter will consistently wake every 45 minutes, but has done long stretches of sleep. My son will do better with 2-3 hour stretches. They used to sleep at least 6+ hours before the 4 month sleep regression. 

I am not emotionally able to do any cry it out methods right now, but I also feel like our schedule is solid and we need to do something. Any advice is appreciated. 

Current schedule (approx):

	•	Wake: \~7:30–8:00 am

	•	Wake windows: 3 / 3 / 4

	•	Nap 1: \~1–1.5 hrs

	•	Nap 2: \~1–1.5 hrs

	•	Day sleep: \~2–3 hrs

	•	Bedtime: \~8:30–9:00 pm

What’s confusing me:

	•	They nap well during the day without waking up     

so they can link sleep cycles.

	•	Nights are rough regardless of tweaks.

	•	Both babies struggle similarly, which makes me feel like we’re missing something.

I also wonder if they struggle with gas? Sometimes when they wake they are burping or passing gas. We do gas drops at bedtime but it doesn’t seem to help. We put them to sleep by rocking or nursing and this is the only way to get them back to sleep. Otherwise their crying will escalate. I’m aware we’ve probably created a strong sleep association here. We’ve tried two nights of pick up put down and it’s almost made them cry more, even though it’s supposed to be a “gentle” approach. 

If you’ve been through this (especially with twins), I’d really appreciate any advice.

I am looking for someone to learn with, code with, or even work on a project with to keep one another motivated.

So far, none of my classes have formally taught coding yet. Before starting school, I learned some **Python, C#, and basic web development**, but nothing too advanced—mostly small console projects like a coffee machine or a choose-your-own-adventure game.

I’ve taken a break from coding for the last 4–5 months, and I’m looking to get back into it. I’m debating between starting a Udemy course or jumping straight into a project. My goal this year is to step up in complexity and build something more substantial using object-oriented programming and data, like a web-based task manager or inventory system.

I usually have about **2 hours on weekdays** to code and more time on **weekends**, depending on my study workload. My typical availability is **6:00 PM – 11:30 PM EST.**

What I’m really looking for is accountability—someone to keep each other on task, study/code together, or possibly even collaborate on a project. If that sounds interesting, feel free to comment or DM me.",2,1769613388.0,ProgrammingBuddies,0,1.0,False

“Ron, we need to talk.” 

 

Ellie is seated at her kitchen table, phone to ear, feet tapping out floor rhythms. Freely spilling tears smear her eye shadow Dalíesque.  

 

“Whatta you mean?” Ron aggressively slurs. 

 

She’d hated him all along. With his whiskey breath and perpetually bloodshot oculi, only her loneliness permitted his actions—the things she’d actually allowed him to do to her. Only solitude keeps her from terminating his iniquitous seed. 

 

“Remember that night at the plant…when I visited you at work? Remember the heat of the reactor as you violated me? You said you were infertile, Ron. You’re not.” 

 

“The fuck? How would you know that?” the man warily enquires. There’s cruelty in his cadence, threats unspoken. Still, she presses on.

 

“How, you ask? I’m pregnant, that’s how.” 

 

“Well…shit, girl. You’re such a slutbag, it could be *anybody's* baby. Remember that time you let me—”

 

“There were no other men, Ron. The child is yours.”

 

Both fall quiet. Ellie hears a familiar clink: a shot glass striking countertop. Not Ron’s first, she reckons.

 

“You at home?” 

 

“Where the hell else would I be?”

 

“I’ll be right over.”

 

Hearing the dial tone, Ellie shivers. Pastel blue walls, speckled with splotches of indeterminate origin, seem to constrict all around her. Five minutes and thirty-two seconds pass before she pulls the receiver from her ear. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Lingering in the parking lot, Ron mutters to himself, “Pregnant, she says. As if I don’t have enough problems in my life. *Fuckin’ bitch.* I’ll show her what’s what.”

 

Slowly, he shuffles forward, a beast in a faded red trucker cap. The pits of his green button-up are soaked, as is the crotch of his jeans. He knows that Ellie is lying. She has to be.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron blinks…and finds himself on Ellie’s front porch. *Did I drive here or walk?* he wonders. Dim animal instinct brings his hand to a rusty doorknocker, to savagely thump it—one, two, three.  

 

A shuffling…and the door swings open. Perspiration-sheened, Ellie now stands afore him, her abdomen drastically protruding. *When did I last see this bitch?*

 

“You’re here,” she tonelessly remarks, visibly disgusted as she eyes him. Smelling whiskey wafting out his own pores, Ron nearly retches, then thinks, *Like I’d give her that satisfaction.*  

 

He pushes his way inside, until they’re face-to-face at the foot of the staircase. Ron smiles now, wolfishly. “Of course I’m here. Did you think I’d abandon you with our child on the way? Let’s go upstairs, and I’ll massage those swollen feet of yours. You look exhausted.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ellie is shocked. This man is not to be trusted. He’s dumb and vindictive, and bites during intercourse. But she’s so damn tired, and her mother won’t be arriving for days. “My feet…really? You always said they were fugly, more hoof than human.”

 

“I’m a changed man, sweetheart. C’mon, let me show you.”

 

Somehow, she finds herself linking hands with the six-and-a-half-foot brute. He pulls her up the stairs, breathing heavily. 

 

At the top of the staircase, Ron turns to her. In her ear, he whispers, “You’re so beautiful right now, Ellie. Like an angel…or a…Super Bowl ring. How ’bout a kiss for Daddy?”

 

His lips terminate her protests, assaulting her with whiskey effluvium. When Ellie begins to gag, Ron pulls away, now unsmiling. Empty-eyed, he outthrusts his arms. 

 

Suddenly, without warning, Ellie is flying through the air, staring up at her own two swollen feet. She hears a sharp *CRACK*, the sound her neck makes while snapping.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron saunters into midnight. *Problem solved*, he reasons. *Now back to the bar. If anyone asks, I never left it.*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, Ellie’s corpse starts to twitch. From betwixt her thighs, a head slowly emerges, trailed by a strangely muscular upper physique, terminating in a pair of crushed legs, all dripping blood and other biofluids. 

 

The fetus pulls himself upright. His lower limbs being useless, cobra-like, he then slithers. It’s impossible, yet some uncanny force draws the boy onward. 

 

One-handedly, the escapee tears away his umbilical cord. Passing into night’s unsympathetic chill, he spares no backward glance for the corpse he’d emerged from. A gust of wind slams the door closed behind him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Chapter 2: In Which We Meet the Pierces**

 

As his ancient blue Oldsmobile rattle-lurches itself homeward, Elmer Pierce struggles to keep both eyes open. It is nearly six A.M., with the sun yet to rise. 

 

Out of coffee, his wife had impelled him toward the nearest convenience store. In fifty-plus years of marriage, never once had Joanna volunteered for predawn errands, but Elmer doesn’t mind. *Mostly.* They love each other, after all.

 

Battling the Sandman, he accelerates. Only when a sudden figure crosses his headlights—some pink, bloody thing wobbling its way across the street—does the oldster fully awaken. 

 

Elmer makes with the brake screech, but it is already too late. He hears a metallic crunching: his vehicle making contact. Though his head rocks forward, prompting a pain flare, the geriatric wastes no time in hopping from the car.  

 

Squinting through green-framed glasses, his stomach heaving forebodingly, Elmer checks his front bumper and finds it crumpled. Beneath it lies the stricken: a male infant, or at least a rough approximation of one, underdeveloped, aside from a strangely muscular upper body. His legs are crushed, but otherwise the child seems unharmed—no scratches, no contusions. 

 

*How did his legs get so messed up?* Elmer wonders. *If anything, his face should be caved in. That’s where the bumper struck.* 

 

The child regards him with a grin, his sky-blue eyes sparkling. Though he’d survived an impact that would’ve annihilated any other child, he isn’t crying, isn’t reacting at all. 

 

To the enigma, Elmer says, “Well, you appear unharmed, which is a miracle in itself. But what shall I do with you? If only I knew where you came from, I could take you back there. For the time being, I suppose that you’ll come home with me. We’ll call the authorities and have you collected. Come along, little one.”

 

Wondering how his wife will react, Elmer hefts the boy up and transfers him to the Oldsmobile’s passenger seat.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Joanna pauses her dishwashing—towel in one hand, wet plate in the other—to study the fetus, intently. A stray lock of hair has escaped her otherwise immaculate bun. Her eyes blear behind frameless glasses.   

 

“You say you hit him with your car—*your car!*—and he wasn’t killed? Well then, I just have to ask: What the hell is this thing? What are we supposed to do with him? He looks like an abortion that lived, for cryin’ out loud.”

 

“Don’t worry, dear. I’m calling the cops, and they’ll have him out of here in no time. Keep an eye on the boy while I grab the phone, *if ya don’t mind*.”

 

Elmer departs for phone retrieval. A shriek brings him rushing back. Hearing Joanna’s plate shatter, he reenters the kitchen to see her face gone shock-ghostly. Speechlessly, she points to the child—what’s left of him.

 

Much of the fetus has turned invisible, leaving only a hovering eye, a hand, and fragments of his torso perceptible. Beholding him in amazement, Elmer wonders, *Might this child be an underdeveloped superhero?* 

 

Eventually, Joanna finds her voice: “Look at him! He’s some kinda demon, Elmer! Get him out of here, fast, before he murders us both!”

 

Absentmindedly rubbing the peak of his bald, liver-spotted cranium, Elmer replies, “Change of plans, Joanna. I can’t dial the police now. They’ll dissect the poor bastard. I guess we’ll just have to adopt him.”

 

“What? No!”

 

 

**Chapter 3: An Aborted Superhero**

 

*From the journal of Elmer Pierce:*

 

The calendar says it’s been months. All that time, and he hasn’t changed one iota. The boy remains just as I found him: a human fetus, roughly thirty weeks old. By all accounts, he should be deceased. Yet somehow he persists, grinning that vacant grin of his, wearing a neon blue shirt—previously Joanna’s—that drapes down to his poor mangled feet. 

 

He stands sixteen inches tall and weighs three-and-a-half pounds. A light lanugo fringe tops his head, downy hair that doesn’t grow. 

 

The boy never sleeps. It’s as if his body died in the womb, and only his powerful will keeps it from rotting. When he eats, which is seldom, the child grabs whatever’s at hand and toothlessly gums it to pulp. It’s quite unnerving to observe. 

 

If he produces waste, I’ve yet to see it. Our limited budget doesn’t cover the cost of diapers, anyway. 

 

Once upon a misbegotten time, I was a research scientist. Remember? Back then, sequestered in the lab day after day, staring into a microscope, I never imagined that I’d end up studying the partially-formed powers of an aborted superhero. It’s fortunate that I keep some old equipment down in this basement—my calorimeter, spectrophotometer, and operant conditioning chamber. 

 

Thus far, simple tests have revealed that the fetus is highly intelligent for his age. Though he doesn’t speak, he understands me well enough to follow simple directions. Just yesterday, he retrieved my bathrobe when I asked for it, like a well-trained dog.

 

I know that he possesses extreme strength and durability, and can turn the majority of his body invisible. If the boy had been carried to term, he most likely would have been able to fly. Presently, however, all he can do is keep his upper body hovering upright, while his crushed legs drag uselessly behind him.

 

Last week, quite by accident, I discovered another capability of my young ward. You see, we’d been in the basement for some time, and my orange juice had warmed considerably. I complained about that with much petulance, I must admit, which prompted the fetus to focus his gaze upon my glass—just for a moment, really. With my next sip, I found the juice to be ice-cold. 

 

Who knows: if not for his premature birth, there could at this very moment be an infant freezing folks into ice sculptures, using only a loaded glance.

 

 

**Chapter 4: How Does Your Garden Grow?**

 

At the kitchen table, they sit: Elmer—fishing cap on, tackle box set before him—and Joanna. Empty coffee cups convene atop antique walnut, aside plates bestrewn with ketchup-streaked scrambled egg remnants. Joanna grins. The fetus is nowhere in sight. 

 

“Your fishing trip’s finally here,” she says. “Once a year…regular as clockwork. Are you excited, Elmie?”

 

“You better believe it.”

 

“That’s nice. Make sure to remember your heart pills.” 

 

“Naturally, my dear.” Patting his pocket, Elmer rattles the medication in question. “Now, I should be back before dark. Please look after the boy while I’m gone.”

 

“Well…okay, but he still makes me nervous.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*Night rolls over the household…*

 

Crossing the threshold, Elmer shapes his sunburnt countenance into a lopsided smile. He clutches a cooler—a tackle box set atop it—with a fishing pole under one elbow. Multicolored lures decorate his vest. 

 

“Joanna, I’m home! Come see what I caught us!”

 

There’s no answer. *She must be sleeping*, he reasons. Entering the kitchen, he sets the cooler upon faded linoleum.

 

Leaning against the refrigerator, bathing in its soothing hum, the fetus regards him with vacant acknowledgement. *This kid needs a name, pronto*, Elmer decides. 

 

“Where’s Joanna, boy?”

 

The fetus raises an arm, indicating the sliding glass door, and what lies beyond it. 

 

“In the backyard, you say? She must’ve been gardening and lost track of time again. *That woman*.” 

 

Elmer steps outside, onto the patio. “Joanna? It’s getting late…and chilly. Why don’t you come inside? The flowers will still be there in the morning. Jo…Joanna!”

 

She sprawls amidst the tulips, both eyes pointed skyward. Her tools are scattered—a toppled watering can flooding rosebush roots, shears nestling among lilacs. She doesn’t breathe, doesn’t move at all.

 

“God, no! Not my wife! Not now! I can’t live without her. Get up, Joanna. Puh…*please*.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Dirt-kneeling, Elmer cradles his wife to his chest, his tears splashing the soil. Suddenly, he gasps. For one transitory moment, he seems to hallucinate a verdant physiognomy—hideously smirking, formed in the shadow space between rosebush leaves. It disappears just as fast as he notices it. 

 

Eighty-four minutes later, he reenters his residence, swollen-eyed, biting his lip to stifle screams. His temples throb; his right hand clenches and unclenches. Unnoticed, soil spills from his pant legs.   

 

The fetus remains in the kitchen. Now slouching afore the sink, he grips the handle of one drawer, making no effort to open it. Sighting the boy’s empty grin, Elmer snaps. 

 

“You…this is entirely your fault,” is his toneless declaration. “You were supposed to save us all, and what did you do? You…you extinguished my sole reason for being. I don’t know how it happened, but you killed her.” 

 

Ever so slightly, the fetus tilts his head, mutely expressing confusion. Now Elmer is shouting, his voice cracking. “Get out of here…and don’t come back! I never want to see your monstrous face again!”

 

He scoops the child off the floor. 

 

Trustingly, the boy hugs Elmer’s neck, just as he’d done countless times prior. Head rested against a bony shoulder, he allows the geriatric to carry him out into the night. 

 

Curb-tossing the fetus, Elmer then reenters his house, realizing that he has a call to make. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Having waited many minutes—glancing from the house to the street, back to the house—the fetus slithers down the sidewalk, his destination unknown. Under soft streetlight illumination, the boy’s tear trails gleam sorrowfully. 

 

 

**Chapter 5: Nathaniel and the Cosmic Womb**

 

*From the journal of Nathaniel Rusk:*

 

*July 5:* I place my pen to paper this time, just like the last, unsure where to start. What I hope to accomplish…indeed, that’s a mystery, even to myself. It exists in a cloud, a rarefied region far too distant to grasp.

 

Here I sit with blood in my eyes, wishing to dig past my corporeal form and pour my soul upon these pages, but my mind is forever traveling faster than my weary hand can scrawl. Still, I do what I can to snatch ideas from the ether, to consign them to paper before they’re lost, knowing that no eyes but mine own shall ever read this sad memoir, anyway.

 

Life can be grand sometimes, those sparkling instants that make me feel as if I can finally peel off this mask I wear to hide my frailties, and show the world that I’m still alive, still kicking. Those moments never last, though.

 

The things we’ve done and endured, both good and bad, never leave us. They may retreat into the shadow realms of our subconscious, but all it takes is a certain scent or song to bring them rushing back. The past never fades completely. It bides its time patiently, until it can reemerge for maximum discomfort.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I dream a lot. Sometimes it seems as if dreams are the only things keeping me Earth-tethered, lead anvils anchoring my hot air balloon soul.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The deliveryman came today. He visits often, twice or thrice a week. 

 

Just after lunch, I detected a subtle shift in my home’s ambiance, heralding something amiss. I arrived at the peephole in time to see boot heels fleeing the vicinity. As always, my dread was interwoven with morbid anticipation. 

 

The package bore no return address, as per usual. No delivery address either. Not even a stamp for legitimacy, just a nondescript brown box. Therein, I discovered a photograph.

 

The snapshot featured an elderly woman, her faded hair tied in a loose ponytail. Her face was old leather, her smile nearly a wince. 

 

On the back of the photo was scrawled, *Henrietta Adams. Delaney Park. 1:35 P.M. Ask her about the pigeons.* I pocketed the picture and discarded the box.

 

I sat around the house until the appointed time, and then took the bus to Delaney Park. As I claimed my seat, my fellow passengers spared me no glances, an occurrence I’ve grown quite accustomed to. With an exhaust blast, the dingy vehicle hurled itself forward. Three stops later, I’d arrived, albeit three minutes late.

 

Frantically, I whipped my head left to right, right to left, seeking the woman from the photograph. 

 

Initially, I believed the park empty, its grassy stretch unmarred by blanket, basket or Frisbee. But there she was, fifty feet leftward, readying herself for a departure. Before a splintery bench she stood, breadcrumbs scattered at her feet, wearing a tattered pink shawl over a yellow sundress. Not a single bird pecked at those breadcrumbs.

 

“Miss Adams,” I shouted, “we need to talk!” Closing the intervening distance, I noticed a profound suspicion nestled within the wrinkle-folds of her face. 

 

“How…do you know my name?” she asked.

 

“Sit down for a minute, and I’ll tell ya,” I pleaded, motioning to the bench. Reluctantly, the woman complied. 

 

“Henrietta, I was sent here to speak with you.”

 

“Who sent you? The government?” She was growing agitated. I knew that I was treading on eggshells.

 

“I don’t rightly know, ma’am. A package showed up on my doorstep. Your photograph was inside of it. On the back of that picture, your name was written, as was the name of this park and the time you’d be here.”

 

“Why me?”

 

“That’s what I’m hoping to find out. I’m supposed to ask you about the pigeons.”

 

She relaxed. “Ah yes, the pigeons,” she sighed. “I used to feed them healthy breadcrumbs, but now I give them poison. I watch them sicken and perish, and it’s so…delightfully cathartic.”

 

I noticed a paper bag in her hand, and snatched it away. Within it, breadcrumbs reeked of ammonia. 

 

“Where are all the pigeons, Henrietta?” Not one was in sight. Usually, Delaney Park is full of ’em, filthy creatures that will shit on you if ya don’t keep an eye out—comfortable in their elevation, knowing you can’t retaliate. 

 

“Look behind that bush there.” With one gnarled forefinger, she indicated an area roughly twenty feet distant, a profusion of oaks and shrubbery. Trudging to that vicinity, I realized that she’d been truthful. 

 

Henrietta must’ve been a very busy woman, for there were dozens of pigeon corpses there, piled behind a bush in varied stages of putrefaction. Glassy eyes stared with no intelligence behind them; inert wings had flapped their last flaps. Coldly, I wondered how her bounty had gone undiscovered.

 

Returning to her, I saw that Henrietta now had drool spilling down her chin. “Did you see ’em?” she asked, her eyes glistening with excitement.

 

“Yeah, I saw them. So what?”

 

“So…nothing. There is no greater significance, none whatsoever. They exist to be slaughtered, as do all of God’s creatures.”

 

“Do you wish to die, Henrietta?”

 

Her lined, leathery brow contracted as she pondered that query. After a lengthy pause that seemed to span hours, she replied, “Sometimes.”

 

That was all I needed to hear. Taking the old gal by the hand, I escorted her over to her dead bird collection. In the shadow of an imposing oak tree, she seemed older than time. 

 

I looked around the park, ensuring that we were still alone. “Look at your pigeons one last time, Henrietta. What do you see?”

 

“They are beautiful, better in death than in life.”

 

“Goodbye, Henrietta.” Gripping her face, I violently twisted it rightward. Her neck broke with a loud crack, but she voiced not an utterance. 

 

Carefully lowering her until her head met the pigeon mound, I noticed that Henrietta’s yellow sundress had wrinkled up on itself. After carefully smoothing it out, I plucked a pigeon from the corpse heap. This, I settled upon Henrietta’s chest, and folded her arms over it. The effect was a skosh surreal, evocative of a little girl snoozing with her favorite stuffed animal.

 

With a sigh, I walked back to the bus stop.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 7:* Another morning, another package. Again, no postage stamp. I brought the thing to my battered desk—where I’m currently seated, writing this. Tearing past the cardboard, I discovered a wooden frame bordering a picture of yours truly, age five. Sharing that photo space, my parents proudly beamed behind my young self, as I exhaled upon birthday cake candles. 

 

I considered the image for a moment, adrift in my own history, and then shattered the glass. On the back of the photo was a message:

 

*Nathaniel,*

 

*Your father and I are so proud of you. Congratulations on your big promotion. I found this in the attic, and thought you might want it. We’ll see you soon.*

 

*Love,*

*Mom*

 

I crumbled the photo, then consigned it to the trashcan. Its frame I smashed to splinters. I was trembling, nearly convulsing, unable to believe that anybody could be so cruel as to use my dead parents against me.

 

They died years ago in a house fire, a freak accident springing from an old toaster. I remember awakening upon our front lawn, retching, under a sickle moon. Stupefied, I saw my parents wheeled past me, zipped into black body bags, pushed by uniformed men with stone faces. 

 

Though I was only seven at the time, I never escaped the doom shroud that enclosed me that night. It drifted in through a thousand pores, entered my blood stream, and coated my heart. Sadly, that was my life’s defining moment. 

 

Beyond a doubt, I now know that the deliveryman is evil. Why else would he stir up such wretchedness? After all the strange and exalting quests that his packages have led me to—years upon years of ’em—the man’s true colors are finally revealed. But if he seeks to profit from my misery, he’s destined for disappointment. Something will have to be done. Soon. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 9:* Today was an unhinged one. I spent all of last night in my front yard, crouching behind its unruliest perimeter hedge. I didn’t move, didn’t sleep, only peered between leaves to monitor my doorstep, hoping that the deliveryman would come. 

 

I wasn’t disappointed.

 

Around 5:30 A.M., a time when most sane folks are still in bed, a white Dodge van pulled up to the curb and ejected a man. Resembling a member of a Christian rock band, he was dressed all in white. His short black hair was parted on the left side. 

 

The deliveryman’s nose was crooked, his beady eyes close-set. Standing well over six feet tall, he clutched the customary brown package. Here was a fellow I’d never seen clearly, having caught only paltry glimpses as he hurried back to his van. At last, I was to confront the bastard.

 

As his loping gait carried him porchward, my careful steps brought me up behind him. Lacing my fingers together, I raised my arms overhead. 

 

The very moment that he set down the package, I bashed the back of the deliveryman’s neck. Surging forward, his forehead collided with the door, knocking him unconscious. 

 

I could have stopped there, but my adrenaline proved overwhelming. I stomped the man’s head, kicked his ribs, and stomped his head again. When I finally ceased, he was no longer breathing. His noggin was a bloody, misshapen mess. 

 

With no better recourse, I dragged the deliveryman indoors and laid him in my living room, at the foot of the couch. I then returned to the porch for the package. Noticing the mess that we’d made, I unrolled the hose from my garage and sprayed all the gore away. It was so early, I’m fairly confident that no neighbor observed me. 

 

As my subsequent search of the fellow revealed no identification, I turned to his last package. Therein was a note, scrawled on a sheet of computer paper. It read, *Take the van. Heed the directions taped to its dashboard. When you reach the cave, follow the lizard with a red spot on its tail. Don’t worry about the body; it will be taken care of.*

 

The last sentence startled me. The deliveryman had apparently arrived at my residence well aware that I’d kill him. Why he would do such a thing, I couldn’t fathom. 

 

I considered ignoring the note, but ultimately elected to heed it. It alleged that the corpse would be taken care of—my paramount concern at the time. At any rate, I couldn’t leave the deliveryman’s van parked at my curb without rousing neighborly curiosity. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

My thoughts racing, I entered the unlocked vehicle, clambering up into its driver’s seat. The spotless interior was permeated with new car smell. The glove box was empty; the key was in the ignition. Taped to the dashboard were directions, which I carefully studied. 

 

Wasting not a moment, I departed my neighborhood, preoccupied with the darkest of forebodings. My journey carried me from the suburbs to the countryside, from the countryside to the forest. I drove for hours, without music to amuse me. 

 

At one point, the unpaved road was overhung with cypress trees—enormous, gnarled sentries flanking both its sides—blocking all sunlight, making my smallest hairs rise. The lane tilted up in the darkness; I realized that my elevation was rising exponentially. 

 

Regaining daylight, I discovered that I’d reached the cave.

 

White mountainside rock, its entrance was tiny and would have to be crawled through. Just a few yards beyond it, a cliff plunged down into an abyss of foliage and bark. The air was so clean and pure that my head swam. 

 

A feeling of great contentment washed over me then, perhaps emanating from the cave itself. I felt as if I could sleep undisturbed for thousands of years, and awaken to a world free of technology and sin. Something tickled my leg; glancing down, I saw the lizard.

 

Its eyes met mine; it seemed that we wordlessly communicated. Its tongue flicked to accent an unspoken point. The lizard wore a camouflage pattern: scales of white, black, brown, and grey intermingled. Clashing with that design was the red blotch on its tail, which resembled freshly spilled blood. 

 

When the lizard bolted into the pitch-black, I reluctantly followed. The cave mouth, tightly rimmed with jagged rocks, tore at both my clothing and the flesh underlying it. Much claret flowed out of me, along with curses and angry mutterings. 

 

Though I should have lost the lizard in the darkness, its tail blotch somehow emanated a faint luminescence. Serpent-like, I wriggled through the narrow passage in pursuit, vexed by a sulfurous stench.

 

Whether my slow ingress went on for minutes or hours, I have no idea. Time lost all meaning as I crawled through the mountain’s vein. Eventually, my frustration became unbearable and I shrieked at the reptile, promising that I’d bite its head off if ever I caught up to it. 

 

Then I noticed the water, liquid which glowed the same hue as the lizard’s tail blotch. The blotch entered that agua, and the two became one. 

 

What strange chemical made the water glow crimson? Beats me. Suddenly, it flowed up around me and I was submerged.

 

Though I backed up the way I’d arrived, the water traveled with me. When I attempted to scream, it poured into my mouth—warm, thick and sugary. With it arrived a numbing sensation, ceasing the pitiful flailing of my arms and legs, leaving me immobilized, helpless. Closing my eyes, I accepted the certainty of my own demise.     

 

\*          \*          \*

 

A cocoon of dreams wove around me. Stars and comets filled my vision. Amidst them, an orb of red liquid grew skin of soil and water, becoming planet Earth. The skin erupted into blemishes and orifices—mountaintops and canyons. 

 

Falling earthward, I encountered bizarre creatures gliding across the landscape. More smoke than flesh, these organisms interlocked to form new shapes, and then vanished entirely. One solidified, growing features identical to mine own. It smiled through my lips and winked with my eyelids. Then it was smog again, windswept into nihility. 

 

Furiously, bricks erupted from the soil—houses blooming upward. Within their walls, phantoms capered, their braying mirth like gargled razor blades. My mentality shrieked, *No!* even as my feet dragged me within one such dwelling. Its walls, floor, and ceiling were brick-paved. On the floor, a crude bed of straw and deerskin accommodated a bearded man and an unshaven female, clutching each other as they slept. Like a storm cloud, a smoke creature hovered over them, sending out vaporous tendrils to caress their exposed flesh. 

 

Her lips parting to moan, the woman stirred in her sleep. Seizing the opportunity, the apparition surged into her body, a smokestack in reverse. Rigidly, the woman sat up and retrieved a sizable rock from beneath the blanket. Her eyes were blank, her bare breasts prodigious. 

 

The rock came crashing down, again and again, obliterating her lover’s features. Blood sprayed profusely, as my legs finally permitted me to flee.

 

Outside, the sky was flaming, the sun no longer spherical. Elongated, it stretched from one end of the horizon to the other. Clouds shriveled and blackened like campfire marshmallows. Trees wilted, their leaves blazing. In succession, the brick buildings were sucked back underground, swallowed by the soil. 

 

The mountains caught on fire, too, as did the ground itself. Curiously, the inferno left me untouched. I saw blue oceans reduced to steam, as terra firma flaked apart underfoot. 

 

Soon, red liquid was all that remained. Gratefully, I tumbled into its embrace. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I awakened inside the white van. Outside, it was dark. My clothes were gone, replaced with a white button-up shirt, white pants, and white boots—the deliveryman’s outfit. My skin was dry. 

 

The keys remained in the ignition. Ergo, I started the Dodge up and drove homeward, headlights blazing in the night.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The return drive was quicker. Mentally berating myself with unanswerable questions, I scarcely perceived the road. Had I really entered the cave, or was it all just a dream? The abrasions on my arms and legs suggested the former. But how had I escaped the place? Where did the clothes come from? Did someone assist me while I was unconscious?

 

Entering my residence, I realized that the deliveryman’s corpse had been removed. The note hadn’t lied. Not even a blood drop remained. 

 

Spotting this journal on the coffee table, I tucked it into my waistband. Then I visited the garage, which remained a mess: newspapers piled head-high, a splintery workbench cluttered with miscellaneous tools, bicycle parts strewn about old baseball equipment, everything permeated with the scent of oil. I watched a kitten-sized rat scurry diagonally, from one corner to another, to disappear into a raggedy wall crater. 

 

After several minutes of fruitless searching, I found what I was looking for: a gas can brimming with processed petroleum—perfect for what I had in mind.

 

I splashed some gasoline around the garage, careful not to waste too much, and then visited my bedroom. Therein, I considered my bed—a king-sized, flannel-draped behemoth—feeling melancholic. My body was three steps ahead of my mind, however, soaking the sheets, carpet and walls.

 

In the bathroom, I filled the toilet with gasoline, and the plugged-up sink, too. In the kitchen, I soaked the refrigerator and stove. I spotted a spider on the countertop and took special pleasure in drowning it. Patting my journal to ensure that it remained in my waistband, I trudged to the front lawn, leaving a gasoline trail in my wake.

 

I’d forgotten to grab a lighter, so I hurried back inside for my Zippo. When I returned, the sky was spilling light rainfall. Hoping that the precipitation wouldn’t thwart my plan, I tossed flame toward petrol.

 

Crying grateful lacrimae, I watched the conflagration spread, a singularly exquisite sight. With an unexpected rapidity, the flames entered my abode. 

 

Soon, the place was illuminated from within, evoking a jack-o-lantern. The roof shingles surrendered, freeing flame tongues to lick the firmament. Hallucinating my parents’ ghosts in the inferno, I bade them rest in peace, as heat scorched my flesh, eight hundred degrees Celsius, at least. 

 

The grass wilted and whitened. Hedges erupted in flames, reminding me of that old Bible story: God speaking through a burning bush. Thus, I lingered there for a moment, both my ears open. Hearing nothing but crackling, I climbed into the van and accelerated down the road. 

 

As pajama-clad neighbors emerged from their houses, I glanced into the rearview mirror and saw my erstwhile home caving in, its walls buckling, collapsing into ash. Then I was gone, my destination unknown.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 11:* This morning, upon awakening, I found myself in the van’s backseat—body aching, psyche aglow with neon purpose. A vision had arrived while I slept: a lonely girl plucking discarded notes from a middle school trashcan, after her classmates and teacher have left the room for their lunch break. 

 

The unassuming young brunette, wearing large, crooked glasses and an ancient patchwork dress, sits mostly invisible to those around her. Silently, she watches her classmates exchanging messages behind the teacher’s back. 

 

These girls, and sometimes boys, seem so blissful, covertly communicating while everyone else sits in boredom. Sometimes they take their notes with them—tucked into a pocket, purse or notebook—but most of them end up discarded.

 

This is when Annabelle strikes. Snatching the papers with trembling fingertips, she stashes them in her plain blue folder, before heading out for a solitary meal at the schoolyard’s edge. 

 

In the safety of her bedroom, Annabelle inspects each day’s catches, leisurely devouring every opinion and factoid. She learns secrets few are privy to: who Linda Martel is “in love” with, why Brian Eckles’ dad rots in prison, and dozens more tidbits, glimpses into a world she’ll never comprehend fully. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Parked outside of a supermarket, I’m now putting together a package for young Annabelle. Within it, she’ll find a note, guaranteed to imbue purpose. 

 

Tomorrow morning, I’ll visit Elm Middle School, to deposit the package in her targeted trashcan before any faculty arrives. Seeing her name on the cardboard, Annabelle will forget all other messages. She’ll take the box home, tear it open, and read the note several times before grasping its meaning.

 

Eventually, she’ll figure out what to do.  ",0,1769613156.0,horrorstories,0,0.5,False

“Ron, we need to talk.” 

 

Ellie is seated at her kitchen table, phone to ear, feet tapping out floor rhythms. Freely spilling tears smear her eye shadow Dalíesque.  

 

“Whatta you mean?” Ron aggressively slurs. 

 

She’d hated him all along. With his whiskey breath and perpetually bloodshot oculi, only her loneliness permitted his actions—the things she’d actually allowed him to do to her. Only solitude keeps her from terminating his iniquitous seed. 

 

“Remember that night at the plant…when I visited you at work? Remember the heat of the reactor as you violated me? You said you were infertile, Ron. You’re not.” 

 

“The fuck? How would you know that?” the man warily enquires. There’s cruelty in his cadence, threats unspoken. Still, she presses on.

 

“How, you ask? I’m pregnant, that’s how.” 

 

“Well…shit, girl. You’re such a slutbag, it could be *anybody's* baby. Remember that time you let me—”

 

“There were no other men, Ron. The child is yours.”

 

Both fall quiet. Ellie hears a familiar clink: a shot glass striking countertop. Not Ron’s first, she reckons.

 

“You at home?” 

 

“Where the hell else would I be?”

 

“I’ll be right over.”

 

Hearing the dial tone, Ellie shivers. Pastel blue walls, speckled with splotches of indeterminate origin, seem to constrict all around her. Five minutes and thirty-two seconds pass before she pulls the receiver from her ear. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Lingering in the parking lot, Ron mutters to himself, “Pregnant, she says. As if I don’t have enough problems in my life. *Fuckin’ bitch.* I’ll show her what’s what.”

 

Slowly, he shuffles forward, a beast in a faded red trucker cap. The pits of his green button-up are soaked, as is the crotch of his jeans. He knows that Ellie is lying. She has to be.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron blinks…and finds himself on Ellie’s front porch. *Did I drive here or walk?* he wonders. Dim animal instinct brings his hand to a rusty doorknocker, to savagely thump it—one, two, three.  

 

A shuffling…and the door swings open. Perspiration-sheened, Ellie now stands afore him, her abdomen drastically protruding. *When did I last see this bitch?*

 

“You’re here,” she tonelessly remarks, visibly disgusted as she eyes him. Smelling whiskey wafting out his own pores, Ron nearly retches, then thinks, *Like I’d give her that satisfaction.*  

 

He pushes his way inside, until they’re face-to-face at the foot of the staircase. Ron smiles now, wolfishly. “Of course I’m here. Did you think I’d abandon you with our child on the way? Let’s go upstairs, and I’ll massage those swollen feet of yours. You look exhausted.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ellie is shocked. This man is not to be trusted. He’s dumb and vindictive, and bites during intercourse. But she’s so damn tired, and her mother won’t be arriving for days. “My feet…really? You always said they were fugly, more hoof than human.”

 

“I’m a changed man, sweetheart. C’mon, let me show you.”

 

Somehow, she finds herself linking hands with the six-and-a-half-foot brute. He pulls her up the stairs, breathing heavily. 

 

At the top of the staircase, Ron turns to her. In her ear, he whispers, “You’re so beautiful right now, Ellie. Like an angel…or a…Super Bowl ring. How ’bout a kiss for Daddy?”

 

His lips terminate her protests, assaulting her with whiskey effluvium. When Ellie begins to gag, Ron pulls away, now unsmiling. Empty-eyed, he outthrusts his arms. 

 

Suddenly, without warning, Ellie is flying through the air, staring up at her own two swollen feet. She hears a sharp *CRACK*, the sound her neck makes while snapping.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron saunters into midnight. *Problem solved*, he reasons. *Now back to the bar. If anyone asks, I never left it.*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, Ellie’s corpse starts to twitch. From betwixt her thighs, a head slowly emerges, trailed by a strangely muscular upper physique, terminating in a pair of crushed legs, all dripping blood and other biofluids. 

 

The fetus pulls himself upright. His lower limbs being useless, cobra-like, he then slithers. It’s impossible, yet some uncanny force draws the boy onward. 

 

One-handedly, the escapee tears away his umbilical cord. Passing into night’s unsympathetic chill, he spares no backward glance for the corpse he’d emerged from. A gust of wind slams the door closed behind him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Chapter 2: In Which We Meet the Pierces**

 

As his ancient blue Oldsmobile rattle-lurches itself homeward, Elmer Pierce struggles to keep both eyes open. It is nearly six A.M., with the sun yet to rise. 

 

Out of coffee, his wife had impelled him toward the nearest convenience store. In fifty-plus years of marriage, never once had Joanna volunteered for predawn errands, but Elmer doesn’t mind. *Mostly.* They love each other, after all.

 

Battling the Sandman, he accelerates. Only when a sudden figure crosses his headlights—some pink, bloody thing wobbling its way across the street—does the oldster fully awaken. 

 

Elmer makes with the brake screech, but it is already too late. He hears a metallic crunching: his vehicle making contact. Though his head rocks forward, prompting a pain flare, the geriatric wastes no time in hopping from the car.  

 

Squinting through green-framed glasses, his stomach heaving forebodingly, Elmer checks his front bumper and finds it crumpled. Beneath it lies the stricken: a male infant, or at least a rough approximation of one, underdeveloped, aside from a strangely muscular upper body. His legs are crushed, but otherwise the child seems unharmed—no scratches, no contusions. 

 

*How did his legs get so messed up?* Elmer wonders. *If anything, his face should be caved in. That’s where the bumper struck.* 

 

The child regards him with a grin, his sky-blue eyes sparkling. Though he’d survived an impact that would’ve annihilated any other child, he isn’t crying, isn’t reacting at all. 

 

To the enigma, Elmer says, “Well, you appear unharmed, which is a miracle in itself. But what shall I do with you? If only I knew where you came from, I could take you back there. For the time being, I suppose that you’ll come home with me. We’ll call the authorities and have you collected. Come along, little one.”

 

Wondering how his wife will react, Elmer hefts the boy up and transfers him to the Oldsmobile’s passenger seat.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Joanna pauses her dishwashing—towel in one hand, wet plate in the other—to study the fetus, intently. A stray lock of hair has escaped her otherwise immaculate bun. Her eyes blear behind frameless glasses.   

 

“You say you hit him with your car—*your car!*—and he wasn’t killed? Well then, I just have to ask: What the hell is this thing? What are we supposed to do with him? He looks like an abortion that lived, for cryin’ out loud.”

 

“Don’t worry, dear. I’m calling the cops, and they’ll have him out of here in no time. Keep an eye on the boy while I grab the phone, *if ya don’t mind*.”

 

Elmer departs for phone retrieval. A shriek brings him rushing back. Hearing Joanna’s plate shatter, he reenters the kitchen to see her face gone shock-ghostly. Speechlessly, she points to the child—what’s left of him.

 

Much of the fetus has turned invisible, leaving only a hovering eye, a hand, and fragments of his torso perceptible. Beholding him in amazement, Elmer wonders, *Might this child be an underdeveloped superhero?* 

 

Eventually, Joanna finds her voice: “Look at him! He’s some kinda demon, Elmer! Get him out of here, fast, before he murders us both!”

 

Absentmindedly rubbing the peak of his bald, liver-spotted cranium, Elmer replies, “Change of plans, Joanna. I can’t dial the police now. They’ll dissect the poor bastard. I guess we’ll just have to adopt him.”

 

“What? No!”

 

 

**Chapter 3: An Aborted Superhero**

 

*From the journal of Elmer Pierce:*

 

The calendar says it’s been months. All that time, and he hasn’t changed one iota. The boy remains just as I found him: a human fetus, roughly thirty weeks old. By all accounts, he should be deceased. Yet somehow he persists, grinning that vacant grin of his, wearing a neon blue shirt—previously Joanna’s—that drapes down to his poor mangled feet. 

 

He stands sixteen inches tall and weighs three-and-a-half pounds. A light lanugo fringe tops his head, downy hair that doesn’t grow. 

 

The boy never sleeps. It’s as if his body died in the womb, and only his powerful will keeps it from rotting. When he eats, which is seldom, the child grabs whatever’s at hand and toothlessly gums it to pulp. It’s quite unnerving to observe. 

 

If he produces waste, I’ve yet to see it. Our limited budget doesn’t cover the cost of diapers, anyway. 

 

Once upon a misbegotten time, I was a research scientist. Remember? Back then, sequestered in the lab day after day, staring into a microscope, I never imagined that I’d end up studying the partially-formed powers of an aborted superhero. It’s fortunate that I keep some old equipment down in this basement—my calorimeter, spectrophotometer, and operant conditioning chamber. 

 

Thus far, simple tests have revealed that the fetus is highly intelligent for his age. Though he doesn’t speak, he understands me well enough to follow simple directions. Just yesterday, he retrieved my bathrobe when I asked for it, like a well-trained dog.

 

I know that he possesses extreme strength and durability, and can turn the majority of his body invisible. If the boy had been carried to term, he most likely would have been able to fly. Presently, however, all he can do is keep his upper body hovering upright, while his crushed legs drag uselessly behind him.

 

Last week, quite by accident, I discovered another capability of my young ward. You see, we’d been in the basement for some time, and my orange juice had warmed considerably. I complained about that with much petulance, I must admit, which prompted the fetus to focus his gaze upon my glass—just for a moment, really. With my next sip, I found the juice to be ice-cold. 

 

Who knows: if not for his premature birth, there could at this very moment be an infant freezing folks into ice sculptures, using only a loaded glance.

 

 

**Chapter 4: How Does Your Garden Grow?**

 

At the kitchen table, they sit: Elmer—fishing cap on, tackle box set before him—and Joanna. Empty coffee cups convene atop antique walnut, aside plates bestrewn with ketchup-streaked scrambled egg remnants. Joanna grins. The fetus is nowhere in sight. 

 

“Your fishing trip’s finally here,” she says. “Once a year…regular as clockwork. Are you excited, Elmie?”

 

“You better believe it.”

 

“That’s nice. Make sure to remember your heart pills.” 

 

“Naturally, my dear.” Patting his pocket, Elmer rattles the medication in question. “Now, I should be back before dark. Please look after the boy while I’m gone.”

 

“Well…okay, but he still makes me nervous.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*Night rolls over the household…*

 

Crossing the threshold, Elmer shapes his sunburnt countenance into a lopsided smile. He clutches a cooler—a tackle box set atop it—with a fishing pole under one elbow. Multicolored lures decorate his vest. 

 

“Joanna, I’m home! Come see what I caught us!”

 

There’s no answer. *She must be sleeping*, he reasons. Entering the kitchen, he sets the cooler upon faded linoleum.

 

Leaning against the refrigerator, bathing in its soothing hum, the fetus regards him with vacant acknowledgement. *This kid needs a name, pronto*, Elmer decides. 

 

“Where’s Joanna, boy?”

 

The fetus raises an arm, indicating the sliding glass door, and what lies beyond it. 

 

“In the backyard, you say? She must’ve been gardening and lost track of time again. *That woman*.” 

 

Elmer steps outside, onto the patio. “Joanna? It’s getting late…and chilly. Why don’t you come inside? The flowers will still be there in the morning. Jo…Joanna!”

 

She sprawls amidst the tulips, both eyes pointed skyward. Her tools are scattered—a toppled watering can flooding rosebush roots, shears nestling among lilacs. She doesn’t breathe, doesn’t move at all.

 

“God, no! Not my wife! Not now! I can’t live without her. Get up, Joanna. Puh…*please*.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Dirt-kneeling, Elmer cradles his wife to his chest, his tears splashing the soil. Suddenly, he gasps. For one transitory moment, he seems to hallucinate a verdant physiognomy—hideously smirking, formed in the shadow space between rosebush leaves. It disappears just as fast as he notices it. 

 

Eighty-four minutes later, he reenters his residence, swollen-eyed, biting his lip to stifle screams. His temples throb; his right hand clenches and unclenches. Unnoticed, soil spills from his pant legs.   

 

The fetus remains in the kitchen. Now slouching afore the sink, he grips the handle of one drawer, making no effort to open it. Sighting the boy’s empty grin, Elmer snaps. 

 

“You…this is entirely your fault,” is his toneless declaration. “You were supposed to save us all, and what did you do? You…you extinguished my sole reason for being. I don’t know how it happened, but you killed her.” 

 

Ever so slightly, the fetus tilts his head, mutely expressing confusion. Now Elmer is shouting, his voice cracking. “Get out of here…and don’t come back! I never want to see your monstrous face again!”

 

He scoops the child off the floor. 

 

Trustingly, the boy hugs Elmer’s neck, just as he’d done countless times prior. Head rested against a bony shoulder, he allows the geriatric to carry him out into the night. 

 

Curb-tossing the fetus, Elmer then reenters his house, realizing that he has a call to make. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Having waited many minutes—glancing from the house to the street, back to the house—the fetus slithers down the sidewalk, his destination unknown. Under soft streetlight illumination, the boy’s tear trails gleam sorrowfully. 

 

 

**Chapter 5: Nathaniel and the Cosmic Womb**

 

*From the journal of Nathaniel Rusk:*

 

*July 5:* I place my pen to paper this time, just like the last, unsure where to start. What I hope to accomplish…indeed, that’s a mystery, even to myself. It exists in a cloud, a rarefied region far too distant to grasp.

 

Here I sit with blood in my eyes, wishing to dig past my corporeal form and pour my soul upon these pages, but my mind is forever traveling faster than my weary hand can scrawl. Still, I do what I can to snatch ideas from the ether, to consign them to paper before they’re lost, knowing that no eyes but mine own shall ever read this sad memoir, anyway.

 

Life can be grand sometimes, those sparkling instants that make me feel as if I can finally peel off this mask I wear to hide my frailties, and show the world that I’m still alive, still kicking. Those moments never last, though.

 

The things we’ve done and endured, both good and bad, never leave us. They may retreat into the shadow realms of our subconscious, but all it takes is a certain scent or song to bring them rushing back. The past never fades completely. It bides its time patiently, until it can reemerge for maximum discomfort.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I dream a lot. Sometimes it seems as if dreams are the only things keeping me Earth-tethered, lead anvils anchoring my hot air balloon soul.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The deliveryman came today. He visits often, twice or thrice a week. 

 

Just after lunch, I detected a subtle shift in my home’s ambiance, heralding something amiss. I arrived at the peephole in time to see boot heels fleeing the vicinity. As always, my dread was interwoven with morbid anticipation. 

 

The package bore no return address, as per usual. No delivery address either. Not even a stamp for legitimacy, just a nondescript brown box. Therein, I discovered a photograph.

 

The snapshot featured an elderly woman, her faded hair tied in a loose ponytail. Her face was old leather, her smile nearly a wince. 

 

On the back of the photo was scrawled, *Henrietta Adams. Delaney Park. 1:35 P.M. Ask her about the pigeons.* I pocketed the picture and discarded the box.

 

I sat around the house until the appointed time, and then took the bus to Delaney Park. As I claimed my seat, my fellow passengers spared me no glances, an occurrence I’ve grown quite accustomed to. With an exhaust blast, the dingy vehicle hurled itself forward. Three stops later, I’d arrived, albeit three minutes late.

 

Frantically, I whipped my head left to right, right to left, seeking the woman from the photograph. 

 

Initially, I believed the park empty, its grassy stretch unmarred by blanket, basket or Frisbee. But there she was, fifty feet leftward, readying herself for a departure. Before a splintery bench she stood, breadcrumbs scattered at her feet, wearing a tattered pink shawl over a yellow sundress. Not a single bird pecked at those breadcrumbs.

 

“Miss Adams,” I shouted, “we need to talk!” Closing the intervening distance, I noticed a profound suspicion nestled within the wrinkle-folds of her face. 

 

“How…do you know my name?” she asked.

 

“Sit down for a minute, and I’ll tell ya,” I pleaded, motioning to the bench. Reluctantly, the woman complied. 

 

“Henrietta, I was sent here to speak with you.”

 

“Who sent you? The government?” She was growing agitated. I knew that I was treading on eggshells.

 

“I don’t rightly know, ma’am. A package showed up on my doorstep. Your photograph was inside of it. On the back of that picture, your name was written, as was the name of this park and the time you’d be here.”

 

“Why me?”

 

“That’s what I’m hoping to find out. I’m supposed to ask you about the pigeons.”

 

She relaxed. “Ah yes, the pigeons,” she sighed. “I used to feed them healthy breadcrumbs, but now I give them poison. I watch them sicken and perish, and it’s so…delightfully cathartic.”

 

I noticed a paper bag in her hand, and snatched it away. Within it, breadcrumbs reeked of ammonia. 

 

“Where are all the pigeons, Henrietta?” Not one was in sight. Usually, Delaney Park is full of ’em, filthy creatures that will shit on you if ya don’t keep an eye out—comfortable in their elevation, knowing you can’t retaliate. 

 

“Look behind that bush there.” With one gnarled forefinger, she indicated an area roughly twenty feet distant, a profusion of oaks and shrubbery. Trudging to that vicinity, I realized that she’d been truthful. 

 

Henrietta must’ve been a very busy woman, for there were dozens of pigeon corpses there, piled behind a bush in varied stages of putrefaction. Glassy eyes stared with no intelligence behind them; inert wings had flapped their last flaps. Coldly, I wondered how her bounty had gone undiscovered.

 

Returning to her, I saw that Henrietta now had drool spilling down her chin. “Did you see ’em?” she asked, her eyes glistening with excitement.

 

“Yeah, I saw them. So what?”

 

“So…nothing. There is no greater significance, none whatsoever. They exist to be slaughtered, as do all of God’s creatures.”

 

“Do you wish to die, Henrietta?”

 

Her lined, leathery brow contracted as she pondered that query. After a lengthy pause that seemed to span hours, she replied, “Sometimes.”

 

That was all I needed to hear. Taking the old gal by the hand, I escorted her over to her dead bird collection. In the shadow of an imposing oak tree, she seemed older than time. 

 

I looked around the park, ensuring that we were still alone. “Look at your pigeons one last time, Henrietta. What do you see?”

 

“They are beautiful, better in death than in life.”

 

“Goodbye, Henrietta.” Gripping her face, I violently twisted it rightward. Her neck broke with a loud crack, but she voiced not an utterance. 

 

Carefully lowering her until her head met the pigeon mound, I noticed that Henrietta’s yellow sundress had wrinkled up on itself. After carefully smoothing it out, I plucked a pigeon from the corpse heap. This, I settled upon Henrietta’s chest, and folded her arms over it. The effect was a skosh surreal, evocative of a little girl snoozing with her favorite stuffed animal.

 

With a sigh, I walked back to the bus stop.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 7:* Another morning, another package. Again, no postage stamp. I brought the thing to my battered desk—where I’m currently seated, writing this. Tearing past the cardboard, I discovered a wooden frame bordering a picture of yours truly, age five. Sharing that photo space, my parents proudly beamed behind my young self, as I exhaled upon birthday cake candles. 

 

I considered the image for a moment, adrift in my own history, and then shattered the glass. On the back of the photo was a message:

 

*Nathaniel,*

 

*Your father and I are so proud of you. Congratulations on your big promotion. I found this in the attic, and thought you might want it. We’ll see you soon.*

 

*Love,*

*Mom*

 

I crumbled the photo, then consigned it to the trashcan. Its frame I smashed to splinters. I was trembling, nearly convulsing, unable to believe that anybody could be so cruel as to use my dead parents against me.

 

They died years ago in a house fire, a freak accident springing from an old toaster. I remember awakening upon our front lawn, retching, under a sickle moon. Stupefied, I saw my parents wheeled past me, zipped into black body bags, pushed by uniformed men with stone faces. 

 

Though I was only seven at the time, I never escaped the doom shroud that enclosed me that night. It drifted in through a thousand pores, entered my blood stream, and coated my heart. Sadly, that was my life’s defining moment. 

 

Beyond a doubt, I now know that the deliveryman is evil. Why else would he stir up such wretchedness? After all the strange and exalting quests that his packages have led me to—years upon years of ’em—the man’s true colors are finally revealed. But if he seeks to profit from my misery, he’s destined for disappointment. Something will have to be done. Soon. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 9:* Today was an unhinged one. I spent all of last night in my front yard, crouching behind its unruliest perimeter hedge. I didn’t move, didn’t sleep, only peered between leaves to monitor my doorstep, hoping that the deliveryman would come. 

 

I wasn’t disappointed.

 

Around 5:30 A.M., a time when most sane folks are still in bed, a white Dodge van pulled up to the curb and ejected a man. Resembling a member of a Christian rock band, he was dressed all in white. His short black hair was parted on the left side. 

 

The deliveryman’s nose was crooked, his beady eyes close-set. Standing well over six feet tall, he clutched the customary brown package. Here was a fellow I’d never seen clearly, having caught only paltry glimpses as he hurried back to his van. At last, I was to confront the bastard.

 

As his loping gait carried him porchward, my careful steps brought me up behind him. Lacing my fingers together, I raised my arms overhead. 

 

The very moment that he set down the package, I bashed the back of the deliveryman’s neck. Surging forward, his forehead collided with the door, knocking him unconscious. 

 

I could have stopped there, but my adrenaline proved overwhelming. I stomped the man’s head, kicked his ribs, and stomped his head again. When I finally ceased, he was no longer breathing. His noggin was a bloody, misshapen mess. 

 

With no better recourse, I dragged the deliveryman indoors and laid him in my living room, at the foot of the couch. I then returned to the porch for the package. Noticing the mess that we’d made, I unrolled the hose from my garage and sprayed all the gore away. It was so early, I’m fairly confident that no neighbor observed me. 

 

As my subsequent search of the fellow revealed no identification, I turned to his last package. Therein was a note, scrawled on a sheet of computer paper. It read, *Take the van. Heed the directions taped to its dashboard. When you reach the cave, follow the lizard with a red spot on its tail. Don’t worry about the body; it will be taken care of.*

 

The last sentence startled me. The deliveryman had apparently arrived at my residence well aware that I’d kill him. Why he would do such a thing, I couldn’t fathom. 

 

I considered ignoring the note, but ultimately elected to heed it. It alleged that the corpse would be taken care of—my paramount concern at the time. At any rate, I couldn’t leave the deliveryman’s van parked at my curb without rousing neighborly curiosity. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

My thoughts racing, I entered the unlocked vehicle, clambering up into its driver’s seat. The spotless interior was permeated with new car smell. The glove box was empty; the key was in the ignition. Taped to the dashboard were directions, which I carefully studied. 

 

Wasting not a moment, I departed my neighborhood, preoccupied with the darkest of forebodings. My journey carried me from the suburbs to the countryside, from the countryside to the forest. I drove for hours, without music to amuse me. 

 

At one point, the unpaved road was overhung with cypress trees—enormous, gnarled sentries flanking both its sides—blocking all sunlight, making my smallest hairs rise. The lane tilted up in the darkness; I realized that my elevation was rising exponentially. 

 

Regaining daylight, I discovered that I’d reached the cave.

 

White mountainside rock, its entrance was tiny and would have to be crawled through. Just a few yards beyond it, a cliff plunged down into an abyss of foliage and bark. The air was so clean and pure that my head swam. 

 

A feeling of great contentment washed over me then, perhaps emanating from the cave itself. I felt as if I could sleep undisturbed for thousands of years, and awaken to a world free of technology and sin. Something tickled my leg; glancing down, I saw the lizard.

 

Its eyes met mine; it seemed that we wordlessly communicated. Its tongue flicked to accent an unspoken point. The lizard wore a camouflage pattern: scales of white, black, brown, and grey intermingled. Clashing with that design was the red blotch on its tail, which resembled freshly spilled blood. 

 

When the lizard bolted into the pitch-black, I reluctantly followed. The cave mouth, tightly rimmed with jagged rocks, tore at both my clothing and the flesh underlying it. Much claret flowed out of me, along with curses and angry mutterings. 

 

Though I should have lost the lizard in the darkness, its tail blotch somehow emanated a faint luminescence. Serpent-like, I wriggled through the narrow passage in pursuit, vexed by a sulfurous stench.

 

Whether my slow ingress went on for minutes or hours, I have no idea. Time lost all meaning as I crawled through the mountain’s vein. Eventually, my frustration became unbearable and I shrieked at the reptile, promising that I’d bite its head off if ever I caught up to it. 

 

Then I noticed the water, liquid which glowed the same hue as the lizard’s tail blotch. The blotch entered that agua, and the two became one. 

 

What strange chemical made the water glow crimson? Beats me. Suddenly, it flowed up around me and I was submerged.

 

Though I backed up the way I’d arrived, the water traveled with me. When I attempted to scream, it poured into my mouth—warm, thick and sugary. With it arrived a numbing sensation, ceasing the pitiful flailing of my arms and legs, leaving me immobilized, helpless. Closing my eyes, I accepted the certainty of my own demise.     

 

\*          \*          \*

 

A cocoon of dreams wove around me. Stars and comets filled my vision. Amidst them, an orb of red liquid grew skin of soil and water, becoming planet Earth. The skin erupted into blemishes and orifices—mountaintops and canyons. 

 

Falling earthward, I encountered bizarre creatures gliding across the landscape. More smoke than flesh, these organisms interlocked to form new shapes, and then vanished entirely. One solidified, growing features identical to mine own. It smiled through my lips and winked with my eyelids. Then it was smog again, windswept into nihility. 

 

Furiously, bricks erupted from the soil—houses blooming upward. Within their walls, phantoms capered, their braying mirth like gargled razor blades. My mentality shrieked, *No!* even as my feet dragged me within one such dwelling. Its walls, floor, and ceiling were brick-paved. On the floor, a crude bed of straw and deerskin accommodated a bearded man and an unshaven female, clutching each other as they slept. Like a storm cloud, a smoke creature hovered over them, sending out vaporous tendrils to caress their exposed flesh. 

 

Her lips parting to moan, the woman stirred in her sleep. Seizing the opportunity, the apparition surged into her body, a smokestack in reverse. Rigidly, the woman sat up and retrieved a sizable rock from beneath the blanket. Her eyes were blank, her bare breasts prodigious. 

 

The rock came crashing down, again and again, obliterating her lover’s features. Blood sprayed profusely, as my legs finally permitted me to flee.

 

Outside, the sky was flaming, the sun no longer spherical. Elongated, it stretched from one end of the horizon to the other. Clouds shriveled and blackened like campfire marshmallows. Trees wilted, their leaves blazing. In succession, the brick buildings were sucked back underground, swallowed by the soil. 

 

The mountains caught on fire, too, as did the ground itself. Curiously, the inferno left me untouched. I saw blue oceans reduced to steam, as terra firma flaked apart underfoot. 

 

Soon, red liquid was all that remained. Gratefully, I tumbled into its embrace. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I awakened inside the white van. Outside, it was dark. My clothes were gone, replaced with a white button-up shirt, white pants, and white boots—the deliveryman’s outfit. My skin was dry. 

 

The keys remained in the ignition. Ergo, I started the Dodge up and drove homeward, headlights blazing in the night.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The return drive was quicker. Mentally berating myself with unanswerable questions, I scarcely perceived the road. Had I really entered the cave, or was it all just a dream? The abrasions on my arms and legs suggested the former. But how had I escaped the place? Where did the clothes come from? Did someone assist me while I was unconscious?

 

Entering my residence, I realized that the deliveryman’s corpse had been removed. The note hadn’t lied. Not even a blood drop remained. 

 

Spotting this journal on the coffee table, I tucked it into my waistband. Then I visited the garage, which remained a mess: newspapers piled head-high, a splintery workbench cluttered with miscellaneous tools, bicycle parts strewn about old baseball equipment, everything permeated with the scent of oil. I watched a kitten-sized rat scurry diagonally, from one corner to another, to disappear into a raggedy wall crater. 

 

After several minutes of fruitless searching, I found what I was looking for: a gas can brimming with processed petroleum—perfect for what I had in mind.

 

I splashed some gasoline around the garage, careful not to waste too much, and then visited my bedroom. Therein, I considered my bed—a king-sized, flannel-draped behemoth—feeling melancholic. My body was three steps ahead of my mind, however, soaking the sheets, carpet and walls.

 

In the bathroom, I filled the toilet with gasoline, and the plugged-up sink, too. In the kitchen, I soaked the refrigerator and stove. I spotted a spider on the countertop and took special pleasure in drowning it. Patting my journal to ensure that it remained in my waistband, I trudged to the front lawn, leaving a gasoline trail in my wake.

 

I’d forgotten to grab a lighter, so I hurried back inside for my Zippo. When I returned, the sky was spilling light rainfall. Hoping that the precipitation wouldn’t thwart my plan, I tossed flame toward petrol.

 

Crying grateful lacrimae, I watched the conflagration spread, a singularly exquisite sight. With an unexpected rapidity, the flames entered my abode. 

 

Soon, the place was illuminated from within, evoking a jack-o-lantern. The roof shingles surrendered, freeing flame tongues to lick the firmament. Hallucinating my parents’ ghosts in the inferno, I bade them rest in peace, as heat scorched my flesh, eight hundred degrees Celsius, at least. 

 

The grass wilted and whitened. Hedges erupted in flames, reminding me of that old Bible story: God speaking through a burning bush. Thus, I lingered there for a moment, both my ears open. Hearing nothing but crackling, I climbed into the van and accelerated down the road. 

 

As pajama-clad neighbors emerged from their houses, I glanced into the rearview mirror and saw my erstwhile home caving in, its walls buckling, collapsing into ash. Then I was gone, my destination unknown.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 11:* This morning, upon awakening, I found myself in the van’s backseat—body aching, psyche aglow with neon purpose. A vision had arrived while I slept: a lonely girl plucking discarded notes from a middle school trashcan, after her classmates and teacher have left the room for their lunch break. 

 

The unassuming young brunette, wearing large, crooked glasses and an ancient patchwork dress, sits mostly invisible to those around her. Silently, she watches her classmates exchanging messages behind the teacher’s back. 

 

These girls, and sometimes boys, seem so blissful, covertly communicating while everyone else sits in boredom. Sometimes they take their notes with them—tucked into a pocket, purse or notebook—but most of them end up discarded.

 

This is when Annabelle strikes. Snatching the papers with trembling fingertips, she stashes them in her plain blue folder, before heading out for a solitary meal at the schoolyard’s edge. 

 

In the safety of her bedroom, Annabelle inspects each day’s catches, leisurely devouring every opinion and factoid. She learns secrets few are privy to: who Linda Martel is “in love” with, why Brian Eckles’ dad rots in prison, and dozens more tidbits, glimpses into a world she’ll never comprehend fully. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Parked outside of a supermarket, I’m now putting together a package for young Annabelle. Within it, she’ll find a note, guaranteed to imbue purpose. 

 

Tomorrow morning, I’ll visit Elm Middle School, to deposit the package in her targeted trashcan before any faculty arrives. Seeing her name on the cardboard, Annabelle will forget all other messages. She’ll take the box home, tear it open, and read the note several times before grasping its meaning.

 

Eventually, she’ll figure out what to do.  ",1,1769613144.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1qpdz2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qpdz2v/i_remember_the_exact_moment_i_realized_i_loved_him/,I remember the exact moment I realized I loved him.,"I remember the exact moment I realized I loved him.

It wasn’t anything dramatic. He was tying his shoes on the edge of my bed, running late for class, complaining about how his alarm betrayed him again. The sunlight hit his face just right, and I thought, *This is it. This is the person I want all my ordinary moments with.*

We were young—too young to understand how fragile happiness can be when you believe it’s guaranteed.

I loved Noah in all the quiet ways. I memorized how he took his coffee, the way he rubbed his thumb against his palm when he was nervous, how he pretended not to care when he lost but sulked for hours after. He made me feel safe in a world that constantly felt too loud, too fast.

We planned everything.  
Our apartment.  
Our dog.  
The names of children we weren’t ready for but talked about anyway.

I thought love was enough.

Then my body started betraying me.

At first, it was exhaustion. The kind sleep didn’t fix. I’d cancel plans and joke about being “dramatic,” but Noah’s eyes always lingered on me a second too long. Then came the pain—sharp, quiet, persistent. Hospital rooms replaced coffee shops. Test results replaced love notes.

I watched fear slowly move into his face, like a guest who overstayed their welcome.

The day the doctor said the word *terminal*, I stopped listening after the first sentence. All I could think about was Noah sitting beside me, gripping my hand so tightly I couldn’t feel my fingers anymore. I wanted to scream, to beg the universe to take anything else instead—but all I did was smile at him and say, “We’ll be okay.”

I lied.

What broke me wasn’t dying.  
It was watching him grieve me while I was still alive.

He tried so hard to be strong. He still made jokes, still held me like I might shatter, still told me I was beautiful even when I didn’t recognize myself anymore. But I saw it in the way his voice cracked when he thought I was asleep. In the way he lingered at the door before leaving for work, like he was memorizing me.

I started pulling away—not because I loved him less, but because I loved him too much.

I didn’t want to be the reason his world stopped.  
I didn’t want to be the ghost he carried forever.

One night, while he slept beside me, I cried into his chest and whispered goodbye. He never heard it. Maybe that’s for the best.

When I finally told him he should go—really go—he looked at me like I had stabbed him.

“I’m not leaving you,” he said.  
And God, I wanted to believe him.

But love isn’t just holding on.  
Sometimes it’s letting go before you destroy the person you love.

The last thing I remember clearly is his forehead pressed against mine, his tears falling onto my face as he begged me to stay. I told him I’d always be with him. I told him he’d find happiness again. I told him he had to live enough for both of us.

When I close my eyes now, I don’t see hospitals or pain.

I see that rainy afternoon.  
The café.  
The spilled coffee.  
The boy who laughed with me on the floor and accidentally became my whole life.

And if I could choose again—  
I’d still love him.

I was also lucky that i reacted quickly and put my hand to cover my head and step to the side, so only some light scratches on my arm.

I realised that the cupboard was drilled in a drywall. Is this...normal in the UK? who drills heavy cupboards on a drywall?! Now im concerned that all the other cupboards might fall off as well.

As this is a safety issue, any advice on how to proceed? I already emailed my agency with details and photos. I just dont know for sure where do i stand and what are my rights.

She does not think she has a problem and thinks I am trying to parent and control her. How can I approach this situation without pushing her further away?

My partner and I have been together around 3 years. We have built a life together. We live together, have pets together, share a car. Our lives are very intertwined. I work a normal day job 8-4, and a couple nights a week at a hotel. She manages a coffee shop in the mornings/evenings and works in a restaurant/bar part time some nights.

When she started working at the restaurant I could see she was starting to drink more. It quickly progressed into every night she works there (2-3 nights a week) turns into her getting drunk and staying out all hours of the night with people I don’t know,  and driving home intoxicated. I expressed my concern of her crossing my boundaries staying out with people I don’t know and being generally unsafe to herself. She took It well and said she was going to make better decisions and didn’t want that for our relationship.

Well, she did not do that and kept going out and things kept getting worse between us. Then something terrible happened. She was blackout drunk 2 weeks ago and taken advantage of by someone we both considered a friend. I fully understand this is not her fault and It was someone we both trusted. I found out second hand (not from her) and don’t really know any of the details. She refuses to talk to me about what happened.

She has continued drinking more and more. She worked at the restaurant tonight, then picked me up at my work after and I could tell she was wasted and had made the 20 minute drive back home to me (I work right near our apartment) like that. She drives home drunk pretty much any night she works there, in an area where the dui arrests are very high. I asked her if she was okay and if she could be more mindful and careful about drinking and driving. She flipped on me, as usual when I try to talk to her about substance problems (there have been others before).

Her drinking is not nightly yet, but multiple nights a week having several drinks, even when she’s not working at the bar. I have tried telling her just because it’s not daily does not mean It is not a problem. I feel she does not realize the problems alcohol is creating in her own life and for our relationship. She refuses to believe it is the main thing causing her issues and a putting her in unsafe positions. I understand that is typical for someone with an alcohol problem. She thinks I am trying to parent and control her when I ask her to make better decisions for our relationship and her own well being.

I am sure she is trying to drown the recent sexual with alcohol instead of facing what happened, which has made everything way worse. She won’t talk to me and I have no idea where to go from here.

* How do I make it so these match my other businesses? 
* Do I just manually build the page and then add it to my business? 
* Or do I just edit the business name on the page after I do this?

1qpdtgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/1qpdtgy/after_6_months_of_rejections_i_finally_got/,"After 6 months of rejections, I finally got interviews at DeepMind, FAIR, and OpenAI.","Been getting auto-rejected from every AI role for half a year. Mid-tier PhD, mediocre research, never worked at FAANG.

Last month I landed interviews at:

* Google DeepMind
* Meta FAIR
* OpenAI

No offers yet (still interviewing), but figured I'd share what changed since I was probably doing everything wrong before.

**The keyword thing is real**

Turns out these places literally filter resumes by keywords before anyone reads them.

You need these exact words:

* LLM or Large Language Models
* RLHF
* Post-training or Fine-tuning
* Transformer, RAG, etc.

Not ""I worked on ML stuff"" or ""familiar with AI."" The actual terms.

I changed this:

""Improved recommendation system using machine learning""

To this:

""Optimized LLM recommendation system using RLHF, improved scores 23%""

Went from zero responses to three interviews in a month.

**Name-dropping is sketchy but it works**

If you're at a big company and talked to someone from an AI team even once, put it on your resume.

Like you're at Google Ads and sat in one meeting where a DeepMind person presented. You can write:

SWE, Google Ads (worked with DeepMind Research)

The difference between ""Google Ads"" and ""touched DeepMind once"" is huge for these applications.

If you don't have this yet, go make it happen:

* Message people in AI orgs for coffee chats
* Find cross-team projects to help with
* Go to their talks
* Submit literally one bug fix to their code

Just need something real you can point to.

**They want a 2000-word writeup (nobody mentions this)**

DeepMind, FAIR, OpenAI, Anthropic all asked me for this. Not code, not a demo—a long written explanation of your best project.

First time I sent in 3 paragraphs like:

""Built backend system with microservices, worked with team, shipped on time""

Rejected everywhere.

What worked was 1800 words structured like:

* Problem (150w) - what sucked and why
* How you solved it (900w) - architecture, why you picked it, alternatives you considered, actual implementation stuff
* Results (400w) - numbers, impact, metrics
* Problems you hit (250w) - bugs, issues, how you fixed them
* What's next (100w) - how you'd improve it

Took me a week to write. Annoying but it's what got me the interviews.

Write it like a paper. Be technical. Show you actually think about tradeoffs.

**Apply to the specific AI teams, not general SWE**

Wasted months applying to:

* ""Google Software Engineer""
* ""Meta ML Engineer""
* Random teams

Got interviews from:

* ""Google DeepMind Research Engineer""
* ""Meta FAIR Research Scientist""
* ""OpenAI Applied AI Engineer""

cause:

* Their recruiters actually know what RLHF means
* Way fewer people apply (most don't think they're qualified)
* They care about depth not LeetCode grinding

**System design prep is different for AI roles**

LeetCode is still needed but system design matters way more. And it's not just memorizing patterns—they drill into every decision.

Been practicing with Screna AI and it's actually helpful because it keeps asking follow-ups:

Me: ""Use Redis for caching""  
It: ""Why not Memcached?""  
Me: ""Need data structures not just key-value""  
It: ""What if Redis crashes?""  
Me: ""RDB snapshots every 5min""  
It: ""Recovery process? How much data loss?""

Real interviews are apparently like this—they keep pushing on every choice you make. Most prep stuff just gives you the answer, doesn't simulate the back and forth.

We'll see if it actually helps. Interviews are next week.

**Current status**

* DeepMind: system design round Tuesday
* FAIR: scheduling tech rounds
* OpenAI: Thursday

No offers. Still very much could bomb these. But after half a year of instant rejections this feels like progress.

Will update if I actually get offers.

She does not think she has a problem and thinks I am trying to parent and control her. How can I approach this situation without pushing her further away?

My partner and I have been together around 3 years. We have built a life together. We live together, have pets together, share a car. Our lives are very intertwined. I work a normal day job 8-4, and a couple nights a week at a hotel. She manages a coffee shop in the mornings/evenings and works in a restaurant/bar part time some nights.

When she started working at the restaurant I could see she was starting to drink more. It quickly progressed into every night she works there (2-3 nights a week) turns into her getting drunk and staying out all hours of the night with people I don’t know,  and driving home intoxicated. I expressed my concern of her crossing my boundaries staying out with people I don’t know and being generally unsafe to herself. She took It well and said she was going to make better decisions and didn’t want that for our relationship.

Well, she did not do that and kept going out and things kept getting worse between us. Then something terrible happened. She was blackout drunk 2 weeks ago and taken advantage of by someone we both considered a friend. I fully understand this is not her fault and It was someone we both trusted. I found out second hand (not from her) and don’t really know any of the details. She refuses to talk to me about what happened.

She has continued drinking more and more. She worked at the restaurant tonight, then picked me up at my work after and I could tell she was wasted and had made the 20 minute drive back home to me (I work right near our apartment) like that. She drives home drunk pretty much any night she works there, in an area where the dui arrests are very high. I asked her if she was okay and if she could be more mindful and careful about drinking and driving. She flipped on me, as usual when I try to talk to her about substance problems (there have been others before).

Her drinking is not nightly yet, but multiple nights a week having several drinks, even when she’s not working at the bar. I have tried telling her just because it’s not daily does not mean It is not a problem. I feel she does not realize the problems alcohol is creating in her own life and for our relationship. She refuses to believe it is the main thing causing her issues and a putting her in unsafe positions. I understand that is typical for someone with an alcohol problem. She thinks I am trying to parent and control her when I ask her to make better decisions for our relationship and her own well being.

I am sure she is trying to drown the recent sexual with alcohol instead of facing what happened, which has made everything way worse. She won’t talk to me and I have no idea where to go from here. How can I confront this situation without pushing her away even more?",1,1769612628.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

Whether it’s a surprise leak under the sink or a mysterious gurgling sound from the toilet, ignoring your home's plumbing can lead to bigger, messier, and way more expensive issues. But the good news? With just a few smart habits and some basic knowledge, you can prevent most of these problems before they even start.

First things first—**watch what goes down your drains**. It might be tempting to rinse off dinner plates straight into the sink, but grease, coffee grounds, and food particles can quickly cause stubborn clogs. Try using a drain strainer and never pour oils down the drain. The same goes for the bathroom—flush only toilet paper, and avoid flushing wipes, even the so-called “flushable” ones.

Another tip: **keep an eye on water pressure**. High water pressure might feel amazing in the shower, but over time, it can stress your pipes and lead to leaks or even bursts. Installing a pressure regulator is a small investment that could save you thousands later on.

**Routine checks are key**. Inspect visible pipes under sinks or in the basement for signs of corrosion, moisture, or leaks. If you notice water stains on walls or ceilings, don’t ignore them—this could be a sign of a hidden leak. Catching these early can prevent serious water damage.

Your drains deserve regular TLC. Every few weeks, flush them with a mixture of hot water, baking soda, and vinegar to keep things flowing smoothly. This eco-friendly combo breaks down buildup and can help prevent nasty odors too.

One of the best pieces of advice? **Know where your main water shut-off valve is**. In an emergency, shutting off the water quickly can make all the difference in minimizing damage.

If you’re heading out of town, turn off the water and drain the pipes to avoid frozen or burst pipes in the winter months. It’s a simple step that’s easy to forget, but can prevent a major disaster while you’re away.

When in doubt, trust a professional. A qualified **plumber** can spot problems you might miss and offer solutions before they escalate. Annual inspections are a smart way to catch hidden issues and keep everything running like it should.

Taking care of your plumbing doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Just a little effort here and there can go a long way toward keeping your home safe, dry, and stress-free.",1,1769612552.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

I've had coffee almost every day of my life since age 17 or 18.  I've drunk all kinds of concoctions, and in my earliest days had ""campfire"" coffee - as my Mom always made on the stove in a Revere ware coffee pot.

A couple of years ago I tried Chameleon brand bottled cold brew espresso.  I don't know why.  It's expensive.  But it probably only took one bottle to get me addicted.  I seriously wonder if they put something in it besides coffee LOL.   

I mix it 1:1 with RO water and add a little heavy cream - and zap it in the microwave..  I've never used sweetener, but this coffee tastes like it has a sweetness that makes my former coffees taste bitter.  Starbucks tastes like cigarettes compared to this.  (although no insult overall, because if I'm out and about and need some, Starbuck's Americano will still do nicely).

But seriously, I am carrying home bottles from the store every week.  I feel so deprived if I have to go without it, even if I've got what should be considered high-grade at home.

1qpdmft,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qpdmft/rach_liz_torres/,Rach Liz & Torres,"The waves rolled in with their familiar steady hush, foam spreading thin across the wet sand before pulling back. Rachel and Elizabeth sat near the water’s edge, legs stretched out in front of them, still glistening from their morning swim. Towels lay bunched beside them, and the town’s rooftops—New Town’s quiet cluster of habs, Anna’s vibrant flower beds, the low hum of quarry machinery in the far distance—felt comfortably close yet far enough away to let the beach breathe.

Elizabeth shook water from her hair, droplets catching the early sun. “That last set of laps nearly killed me. You were flying today.”

Rachel grinned, flexing her feet in the sand. “You kept up just fine. Legs still attached?”

“Barely.” Elizabeth reached for her datapad, propped against an empty water bottle. “So… tomorrow. Full beach south to the cliffs. We’ve talked about it enough—let’s actually do it.”

“Agreed.” Rachel pulled her own datapad from the small dry bag. “Most of the day, easy pace. Food, that new Black Rifle dark blend you scored, the works. We’ll need security, though. Council’s still twitchy about the outer stretches.”

Elizabeth nodded. “Torres or Sergeant Lili Bauer. Torres is solid—quiet, steady. Lili’s probably already up plotting sniper drills or something.”

Rachel laughed softly. “Knowing Lili, she’s been awake since 0400 running drills. Let’s see.”

She started typing.

Rachel to Lili Bauer:

Lili – Liz and I want to walk the full beach tomorrow, south to the cliffs and back. Most of the day. Can you come? 0930 start at town access? Or Torres if you’re already booked?

They waited, watching a pair of seabirds skim low over the water, wings almost touching the surface.

The reply came fast.

Lili Bauer:

Already locked in tomorrow—sniper training on the beach 0800-1500. Observation eval for Torres too. She’ll escort you and Elizabeth instead. How long exactly?

Rachel glanced at Elizabeth, who mouthed most of the day.

Rachel:

Most of the day—out to the end and back. Liz and I are supplying food and she just mentioned Black Rifle dark blend coffee. Have Torres reach out today to coordinate. We’re drying off now—talk soon.

Send.

Elizabeth smirked. “You’re really leaning into that coffee. It’s going to ruin her for regular stuff.”

“It’s weapon-grade. She’ll survive.” Rachel’s datapad pinged again.

Lili Bauer:

Wish I could tag along—sounds ideal. Next time for sure. Torres will ping shortly. Enjoy drying off.

Rachel typed back.

Rachel:

Deal—maybe join us for a morning swim here one of these days. We’ll drag everyone eventually.

Send.

Elizabeth leaned closer, shoulder brushing Rachel’s. “Add the evening idea too. We could do a relaxed night swim sometime—grab drinks after, see if Jeff wants to come out of hiding. He’s been in that brewhouse way too long, tinkering with his latest batches.”

Rachel’s fingers moved again, a small grin tugging at her mouth.

Rachel:

Liz says evening swim sometime soon—maybe see Jeff first. He’s buried in the brewhouse again.

Send.

Seconds later:

Lili Bauer:

Evening works better. Soon. I’ll drag Jeff out—he owes me a tasting session anyway 😂

Rachel laughed outright.

Rachel:

Go get him. Tell him the sisters demand a new brew for the next hike.

Send.

She set the datapad down and leaned back on her hands, sand warm beneath her palms. “Lili versus Jeff the brewer. I’d pay to watch that showdown. He’s probably got a new stout fermenting and hasn’t seen daylight in days.”

Elizabeth chuckled. “Poor Jeff. Between Lili calling in favors and us wanting samples, he’s doomed.”

A new chime—Torres.

Torres:

Miss Rachel, Miss Elizabeth—Sgt. Bauer assigned me escort tomorrow. 0930 at town beach access. Bringing patrol kit and extra water. Looking forward to trying that Black Rifle blend. See you then.

Rachel showed Elizabeth the screen. “We’re locked in. Torres is game.”

Elizabeth stood, brushing sand from her legs. “Perfect. Breakfast now—I’m starving. Then you can check those orders for Dad. Mom messaged you yesterday, right? Something about clothing catalogs?”

Rachel rose too, slinging the dry bag over her shoulder. “Yeah—Patricia wants help picking new stuff. She’s frugal as ever, but I’ll send her the catalogs I know. Maybe throw in a hint about Jeff’s next seasonal ale while I’m at it.”

“Agreed,” Elizabeth said, bumping her fist lightly against Rachel’s. “To full-length adventures, sis—and to whatever Jeff’s got on tap.”

They started up the gentle slope toward town, wet footprints already dissolving behind them. The sun climbed, warming salt-streaked skin, and the ocean kept its endless rhythm—like it knew they’d be back tomorrow, ready to follow it all the way to the end.

As they walked into New Town, the familiar smell of fresh bread and coffee pulled them toward Checkers, the central eatery that had become the unofficial heart of the colony. Aino and Marcus were already at the council table, the same sturdy four-seater in the middle of the room, not tucked away in a corner but right where anyone could approach if they needed to speak to a council member. It was deliberate: open, accessible, part of the quiet promise that New Town ran on trust and conversation, not closed doors.

Aino spotted them first and waved them over with a grin. “The swimmers return. Sit, Marcus just ordered the usual stack. Plenty for four.”

Marcus, massive as ever, gave a small nod and a rare half-smile as he pushed out chairs. “Coffee’s hot. Black, no frills. Figured you’d want it strong after the laps.”

Rachel slid into her spot. “You know us too well.”

Breakfast unfolded the way it always did at that table: easy talk about the quarry schedule, Anna’s latest flower hybrids, a quick update from Marcus on the street-sweeper brush motor holding up perfectly. No one minded the occasional New Town resident stopping by—a quick question about shipment timing, a thank-you for the new playground equipment, a kid shyly showing off a drawing. The council table stayed open, the conversation flowing around interruptions like water around rocks.

When plates were cleared and mugs refilled one last time, Rachel and Elizabeth stood. “Duty calls,” Rachel said. “See you both later.”

Aino raised his mug. “Tomorrow’s the big walk. Don’t get lost out there.”

Marcus rumbled, “Torres’ll keep them straight.”

They stepped out into the bright morning and walked the short minute to Elizabeth’s place—her office below, living quarters above. Rachel kept a small stash of clothes there: practical shirts, leggings, the new workout gear from the last shipment. They changed quickly, salt rinsed skin traded for clean, dry layers, hair still damp but tied back.

The day drew down in its usual rhythm—messages checked, orders confirmed for Tornel, a quick call with Patricia about clothing catalogs (“Send the practical ones first, Rachel dear, but maybe one pretty dress wouldn’t hurt…”). By late afternoon, Elizabeth’s datapad chimed with her own message to Rachel.

Elizabeth:

Pizza ordered. Torres just pinged—she’s on her way. Come over. Garden’s calling.

Rachel smiled at the screen and typed back.

Rachel:

On my way. Save me a slice.

Minutes later she arrived, slipping through the side door into Elizabeth’s garden. The moonlilies were just starting to glow in the fading light, purple starblooms nodding gently. Torres was already there, off duty now, light armor swapped for casual clothes, sitting cross-legged on a cushion with a water bottle in hand.

The young Ykanti delivery girl arrived right behind Rachel, pizza box warm and fragrant—extra mushrooms and cheese, as always. They thanked her, tipped generously, and spread the box on the low table in the garden.

The three of them settled in, legs stretched, pizza slices in hand, the day’s tension melting away in laughter and gossip. Torres told stories from sniper training—how Lili had made the privates run laps with full gear just to “build character.” Elizabeth recounted her latest botanical find near the quarry edge, some stubborn little vine that refused to die. Rachel teased them both about their coffee tolerances after tomorrow’s Black Rifle adventure.

“Torres,” Rachel said between bites, “you sure you’re ready for that blend? It’s basically rocket fuel.”

Torres grinned. “Bring it. If I can survive Lili’s 0400 PT, I can handle your murder-coffee.”

Elizabeth laughed, leaning back against a cushion. “Best part of the day. Pizza, garden, good company. Tomorrow’s going to be even better.”

As the pizza dwindled and the twin moons climbed higher, Rachel leaned forward, a mischievous glint in her eye. “Liz, Torres—I ordered you an assortment of seeds and cuttings today. Free sample from the last supply run. They’re coming in the next drop.”

Elizabeth’s eyebrows shot up. “What kind? Mainly flowers? Fruit tree cuttings?”

“Bit of everything,” Rachel said. “Flowers for Anna’s beds, some fruit trees… even persimmon. And , leaning into the two of women she whispers, tobacco seeds.”

The garden filled with laughter. Elizabeth covered her face with her hands, shaking her head. “Tobacco? I’ll need to do research. That’s… ambitious.”

Rachel’s grin widened. “Imagine a glass of bourbon with a nice Haego cigar. We could be onto something.”

Elizabeth snorted. “There’s a market for cigars. I used to sneak my dad’s every now and then when he wasn’t looking.”

Torres burst out laughing, pointing at herself and then at Rachel. “Me too!”

“Me three,” Rachel admitted, raising her hand. “Guilty.”

They dissolved into giggles again, the kind that made their sides ache.

Eventually the laughter tapered off. Rachel stretched, looking up at the moons. “This is a good day. I’ll have more than work to write in my journal tonight.”

Elizabeth tilted her head. “You keep a journal? Then you have me in it.”

Rachel smiled, soft and teasing. “That’s private, sis.” She winked. “Nothing bad.”

Elizabeth laughed. “Well then, you can quote me tonight.”

“Shush, you.”

Rachel stood, brushing crumbs from her lap. “Heading home. See you both bright and early tomorrow—don’t be late for the coffee torture.”

She waved and slipped out of the garden, the door clicking softly behind her.

As she walked the short path to her own hab under the glowing moons, Rachel’s thoughts drifted. I wonder what Clara, Cynthia, and her— her eyes sparkled just a bit in the dark —Wyatt would say about all this. Seeds, cigars, beach walks, and sisters who keep journals. She smiled to herself, the night air cool and full of promise. Tomorrow the sand would stretch long, the coffee would bite, and the day would be theirs, And  then a tear came to her eye as she thought of her dad and a cigar . ",3,1769612346.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False

1qpdlg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyInTheNetherlands/comments/1qpdlg2/i_feel_like_im_not_really_living_student_life/,I feel like I’m not really living student life,"Hi! Sorry in advance, the text can seem a little bit long.

I’ve been studying at Utrecht University for about six months now, the same amount of time I studied in Kyiv, Ukraine. In both places, I had a similar tutorial group size (around 20-25 peeps) but the atmosphere here feels so different.

Back in Ukraine, I studied program “International Communications” in Kyiv University of International affairs/relations. My program was amazing for me:full of creative activities, decorations, events, guest speakers, opportunities and multiple departments like Partnerships and Information, where we worked on the program’s page, design and other projects. In tutorial group we celebrated each other birthdays with cakes and flowers, kept in touch in group chats about all sorts of topics, helped each other with homework and even divided the work for exams to make it easier and to help everyone cope. We went together to coffee or lunch and even ran hackathons.

Despite the war and constant missile and drone attacks, I could see students tried to live fully, study actively and support each other in every possible way .It was energizing and fun. it made me feel alive and motivated and helped me grow a lot inside.

Here in Utrecht, I’m studying Economics and Business and it feels very different. Usually it’s one class per day at most, math is very hard for me (which is my problem ofc), and the program doesn’t feel like it fits me. I know nobody’s going to hold your hand  during studies here which is fine (different system), but it feels strange when 20% of the grade is midterm, 80% is final exam and there’s almost no coursework, projects or checks during the semester. Back from where I am, it was usually 60% active work throughout the course and 40% exam. It felt fair, engaging and most important- motivating. Here it just feels slow ,like I’m not really studying or living in the moment.

I also totally don’t feel any desire from people to socialize. It’s already been one semester, the group chat is mostly silent, only a few messages in the beginning , and when I once asked a question about an assignment, nobody replied :( People leave immediately after tutorials and almost all social interactions seem to be about partying and beer on Fridays and Saturdays. Also sometimes it feels like alcohol is not an attribute but a center of a meeting for people.

I just don’t feel the student energy, creativity or engagement I loved back there. I feel like I’m losing my potential and wonder if maybe I’m doing something wrong, or if I just haven’t found the right way to engage yet.

🫶🏽I don’t mean to offend anyone. I’m genuinely curious, because this part of student life was incredibly important to me and shaped my experience, character and at some point - my future.

Is this normal at Dutch universities or is it just my experience? What should I change in myself? My vision? Just accept differences in mentality and studying style?

How do students here actually socialize and find energy in their academic groups?",8,1769612283.0,StudyInTheNetherlands,6,0.9,False
1qpdlds,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1qpdlds/model_possibility/,Model possibility,"When we say “I could have done otherwise”, what we really mean is that I could have done otherwise relative to an abstracted functional model. In other words, we can define some functional model that maps to a particular situation. We could call the possibilities relative to the model, **model possibilities**. These possibilities are properties of an information system, not ontological actualities.

This makes no conflict with determinism. All it means is that we can logically say something like “If offered coffee or tea, I can have coffee or I can have tea.” This is a model that repeats itself over and over in reality. It only seems to contradict determinism if we confuse the abstract model with a particular instantiation of the model.

Model possibilities don’t need to be real in the same way a physically thing existing is real. It’s real in the same way math is real. I can say 1 + x = y . We could call this a simple model where the possible values of x and y are a set of ordered pairs. We can say the same thing about abstract logic, like “*p* or *q*, but not *p* and *q*” is basically saying I have to choose only one of two options, like coffee or tea. The set of model possibilities is those two options.

The point is that when we say I could have done otherwise, it’s meaningful because we abstract the real situation into a model and recognize different model possibilities. It seems like there’s a lot of confusion about what we mean by “possible”, again because we are confusing an abstract model with a specific instantiation of a model.

I’m not going to say this supports free will or not, just that when we choose over a set of possibilities, we really mean model possibilities (regardless of whether the model is accurate), not the kind of possibility (which really becomes synonymous with actuality) that many free will skeptics insist on. We are making choices in this way regardless of what we decide about moral responsibility, justice, etc.

Also as a fun aside, this is very similar to how AI pioneer François Chollet describes intelligence: He describes an ability to create models on the fly that map to novel situations. Without the model, we really can’t make intelligent choices. We create these models that aren’t perfect pictures of real situations, but map to some functional piece of a real situation. This is essentially how learning happens: By recognizing patterns and creating mental abstractions that define model possibilities we can choose from. More intelligent choices use more complex models, by cobbling together pieces of smaller models learned of through experience.",4,1769612279.0,freewill,8,0.83,False

After months of late-night coding sessions fueled by way too much coffee (and instant noodles, ironically), I'm finally ready to share Chef Pip - an AI-powered cooking companion!

The idea: We've all been there - staring at random ingredients in the fridge wondering ""what can I even make with this?"" Or endlessly scrolling through recipe sites that require ingredients you don't have. I wanted to create something simpler: a friendly  chef you can just chat with, that gives you recipes based on what you actually have.

That's how Chef Pip was born! 

What Chef Pip does:

Snap a photo of your fridge or pantry and get instant recipe ideas. Chat with Chef Pip about cooking tips, ingredient substitutions, or meal inspiration. The app is family-friendly with allergy support and dietary preferences built in. Available in 8 languages (EN, NL, DE, FR, ES, TR, IT, PL) with a beautiful UI featuring dark/light mode and fun animations.

What I need:

20 testers for Android (closed testing on Google Play). Keep the app installed, created account and use it for 14 days. Send me a screenshot of the app with your logged-in account as confirmation. Any feedback is welcome - bugs, UX issues, feature ideas!

What you get:

1qpddzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1qpddzh/a_formal_apology_to_charlottemecklenburg_schools/,A Formal Apology to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools,"On the eve of Monday, January 26th, esteemed news publication *The Charlotten* published a report titled **“**[CMS Cancels School For Remainder Of Year.](https://thecharlotten.com/cms-cancels-school-for-remainder-of-year/)**”** At the time of publication, the district’s official position was that classes would resume on Wednesday.

Our report contained several detailed observations, including:

>“...After consulting with emergency management, the district has determined that reopening before June presents an unacceptable logistical risk,” the statement read. “**Until the sun’s angle changes significantly in late April, we cannot guarantee that a bus will not encounter a damp patch of pavement in Mint Hill**.”

>“...Superintendent Dr. Crystal Hill noted that the choice to scrap the spring semester was weighed carefully against academic standards. 'The decision to forfeit the remaining five months of the curriculum was difficult, but **was made easier by the fact that no one attends classes anyway**,' Dr. Hill told reporters.”

The post subsequently reached over one million people on [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DT-ja1MDcNP/). But while the community responded with warmth, CMS leadership did not. A district spokesperson soon reached out with a formal request to **“remove and correct”** the content, labeling it as ""false"" and ""inaccurate"":

https://preview.redd.it/nlyltnwqq3gg1.png?width=274&format=png&auto=webp&s=c769b1f4d04ae56e5becf742802e4cf142b92fc9

**However, we must now apologize.**

Less than 24 hours after being told our information was ""false,"" CMS released an official announcement: **School was, in fact, cancelled for Wednesday**. And probably will be after that too.

We sincerely regret that our satirical ""misinformation"" became the district's official policy before they even had a chance to finish their morning coffee. It was never our intent to be so accurate that we rendered the district’s own communications department redundant.

It is truly unfortunate that while a $1.7 billion institution was tasked with navigating a city-wide weather event, they were forced to divert resources toward managing a satirical article. To assist in rectifying this situation, we have taken the following steps:

* **Educational outreach**: we have provided the district with a formal definition of ""satire"".
* **Administrative transparency**: We have filed a **Public Records Request (FOIA)** to review internal Slack logs and emails. We wish to see exactly how much taxpayer-funded time was spent discussing *The Charlotten* during a period of ""localized glitches"" and winter storms.

We promise to try and be less prophetic in the future. In the meantime, you can follow the full saga of our ""correction"" [here](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18056402969373331/).

In the interest of civic duty, we’ll be sure to share the results of the Public Records Request once they arrive. We believe the taxpayers deserve to know if their district is being run by a school board or a dedicated team of *The Charlotten* readers.

Until then, stay safe, stay warm, and remember: if the district calls it misinformation, it’s probably happening tomorrow.

Respectfully,

**The Editor-in-Chief**

I had a c section Dec 4th, in my hometown as thats where I was living when I got pregnant and chose to keep my prenatal care and delivery there as both of our families are there - this hospital being a 3 hour drive from where we now live. 

Fast forward to my post-op appointment 6 weeks later. I was sooo nervous about having her on the highway because in my area it’s a really bad highway (I live in Northern Ontario and highway 11N is absolutely terrible). The night before my appointment I suggested that my partner stay home with our LO since he’d already booked the day off. I had some random bags of frozen BM from the odd pump, plus we have formula as that’s what she takes before bed. Otherwise she is EBF. 

That being said, he agreed. And him, my mom, and his mom all tried to convince me that I’ll be okay (I really didn’t want to leave my baby, but I knew she was safer at home) and tried convincing me that after being cooped up in the house for 5 weeks, it would do me some good to get away. Unpopular opinion: I’m a smoker. They all told me to use this time to enjoy the drive, listen to my music, drink the coffees and smoke

My cigarettes in peace. Lo and behold - I had an alright day, I miss being on the road, I miss blaring my music. 

Fast forward to now, I talked to my partner a few days ago about going back to my hometown to continue to see “my” nail tech instead of finding a new one here in our area. I have a really bad problem with an ingrown toe nail and she’s always been super good to me and the pain is now becoming unbearable. He thinks it’s a good idea, gives me some “me” time and gives him his quality time with his daughter. 

My problem now: the first trip was a necessity, it was a doctors appointment. Going forward it’s leisure. 3 hour drive one way, plus 2-3 hours while I’m there between doing a Walmart run (we don’t have one here), plus my nail appointment. 

Now I feel guilty… he’s still trying to tell me it’s a good thing, and that I deserve a breather like that. To take care of me, pamper myself… and I just can’t seem to actually let go of the guilt… the what ifs.. every possible bad scenario that I can’t simply rush home for…

I just want to share but I’m not advocating that anyone go start stinging themselves with bees willy nilly style. 

I began bee venom therapy (stinging myself with bees) to heal from Lyme disease. Bee venom causes a very strong anti-inflammatory response in the body. Since I began in the summer I have not had a serious flare. I’ve even experimented trying some of my trigger foods. 

I had an accidental bee sting summer ‘24 and for 2 weeks I had zero IC symptoms. 

Bit by a tick and contracted Lyme in May ‘25. IC also amped up. After doing the standard medical Lyme treatments and remaining very sick I turned to bee venom to treat the Lyme (I’m aware it sounds insane, but I was desperate). 

It has been months since I’ve experienced a debilitating flare. A cup of coffee could ruin a week. I’ve had well over 40 stings since the summer. I’m on my second cup of coffee this morning. 

I did find an article that bee venom has been used to treat IC in eastern medicine. This isn’t a cure, but I wanted to share just in case it could help someone.

I am a student in the UK and I am working on an idea for a social app, and I wanted some honest opinions from people here.

The concept is a Tinder-style app, but instead of swiping on people, you swipe on local events and activities. Things like coffee meetups, gym sessions, study groups, walks, museum visits, casual football, pub quizzes, etc. Once you join an event, you are added to a group chat with everyone attending so you can talk beforehand and actually show up knowing people.

The goal is to make it easier to make friends without the awkward one-to-one pressure of dating apps, especially for:

* people new to a city
* students

I am not trying to sell anything, just genuinely testing whether this is something people would actually use.

Would this appeal to you?  
What would put you off?  
Does something like this already exist that works well (that you use)?

Any thoughts (positive or negative) would really help. Thanks ",1,1769611283.0,MakeFriendsUK,2,1.0,False

1qpd472,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qpd472,North Quincy Food Pantry: Can we put a donation bin on your porch?,"Hi everyone! I’m with **Good Neighbors Food Pantry**, a community food pantry effort serving North Quincy and surrounding communities. Right now, we’re 70+ families every month, but, as we grow, our small and mighty donor base can’t alone guarantee our continued work. 

We are launching a **Neighborhood Leads** program. Instead of huge food drives, we’re looking for people who are willing to host our donation bin on their porch, engage their personal networks to do the same, and bring our mission to doorsteps throughout the community. 

We want to build a community of volunteers, leaders, and activists within our larger mission of providing dependable, nutritious food to those in need.

**The Goal:** Make it so easy to donate that neighbors can just drop off a can of soup, bag of flour, winter clothes, or non-food essentials while they're out for a walk and heading to work.

**How to help:**

* **Host:** Comment below or email me at [**goodneighborsne@gmail.com**](mailto:goodneighborsne@gmail.com) if you can host a bin!
* **Donate:** Drop off items at our partner bins that I plan to setup today at Roxie’s and Roots & Roasts coffee shop.
* **Share:** Have a friend looking to get involved? Share this opportunity with them!

What we’re looking for: non-perishable food (flour, oil, canned protein), non-food essentials (toilet paper, soap), and gently used winter clothes.

Let’s keep our community fed, one porch at a time!

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

“Fuck.” I breathed.",1,1769611108.0,scifishorts,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone,
This is a bit hard for me to post, but I’ll keep it real.

I’m a 22-year-old guy living in Wakad. I’ve been feeling extremely low and mentally exhausted for a while now. I don’t really have anyone I can talk to or meet, and it’s been getting heavy lately.

I’m not looking for dating, hookups, or anything like that. Not looking for girls or boys specifically. Just a genuine human conversation. Even a simple walk or coffee is fine. Silence is also okay  sometimes just not being alone helps.

If you’re an introvert, feeling stuck, lonely, or just need to vent without judgment, we might understand each other. I may not open up easily, but I’m trying.

We can meet in Wakad for a short walk or coffee.
If anyone’s up, 

Please don’t judge. I’m genuinely struggling and just trying to cope the right way.

Thanks for reading.

1qpcy56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Generator/comments/1qpcy56/keep_champion_55004000_watt_or_exchange/,Keep Champion 5500/4000 watt or exchange?,"I had been dragging my feet getting a generator, and finally broke down last week due to the impending storm and my wife being pregnant (she’s tough to argue with normally, impossible to argue with now lol). One of the few options available was a Champion 201470 (gas only, 5500 surge, 4000 continuous with remote start). I haven’t opened the box and am within the generator return window, so I’m torn on what to do. 

House is all electric.

What we absolutely need: Fridge, garage freezer, charge phones, maybe a space heater in winter or some fans for summer (I know, propane heaters are great and we have one, but I’m concerned about carbon monoxide), a drop light or two, sporadic microwave use, coffee maker, pellet grill.

I have a propane camping stove and a few small tanks for cooking, and plenty of pellets for the grill. 

Part of me would love the convenience of plugging into the house instead of running cables through a window, but I wouldn’t be able to do that with a 120v unit, correct? Most 240v inverters I see are higher output, and would use more fuel, correct?

I don’t have a receptacle or a transfer switch in my house, and have no desire to spend the money to get those installed. We might buy a larger house at some point though, and if the house already has a receptacle, I’d love to plug in instead of running cables through a window.

Where I’m at: The non-remote start version (still has electric start) dual fuel unit could be had for $15 more than I paid. A larger 6500/5250 watt dual fuel Champion with pull start only would be the same $15 up charge. A smaller unit that is more portable, uses less gas and still gets the job done would save a few bucks. 

What is your recommendation? 

Is duel fuel worth exchanging for? Did I go too large for my current needs? Would I burn through significant more fuel with a larger inverter that can at some point connect to a house? Sorry for the long-winded post. ",2,1769610779.0,Generator,14,1.0,False

We hadn't really spoken much recently, so I figured he was ready to settle down.  Here's where things get really weird, tho. In the days and weeks leading up to the wedding, Mark started acting...off. He was sending me flirty messages, complimenting me, and generally being a bit too friendly. I brushed it off, thinking maybe he was just excited or something. Then, the day before the wedding, he was really pushing to meet up. Like, persistent. He kept suggesting we grab coffee or ""catch up."" I was completely taken aback. I mean, the guy was getting married the next day! Made an effort to even travel a different city just to meet  Now, his social media is flooded with wedding photos, And I'm just here scratching my head trying to make sense of it all. Why the last-minute flirting? Why the sudden attempts to hang out right before he got married? Was he just looking for a last-minute ego boost? Did he have cold feet? I have no idea.

It is the morning of the 20th of January. eight days since my operation.

In precisely two hours, a lovely, lovely nurse is going to come into my room and remove a catheter from my body, after which I will attempt my very first wee all by myself. To say I have some trepidation about this is a slight understatement. Still, we have successfully managed a number of poos so far, which feels like an important early milestone. No messes, no disasters. A quiet, dignified success. Sorry if that was too much information, but if you are reading a diary entry, you know what you signed up for.

Yesterday, after what I can only describe as a misinterpretation of the phrase “short walks”, I returned to my hospital room and lay down on the bed, only to notice that my legs had swollen to a degree that could generously be described as comic. My feet, in particular, had taken on the appearance of small, little piggy trotters. The nurses came in, looked at them, took photographs, exchanged concerned glances, and firmly instructed me to get back into bed, remove all compression items, elevate everything, and most importantly, stop moving.

It turns out that crossing sixteen lanes of traffic and doing a leisurely circuit of a shopping mall does not qualify as “a little walk”, no matter how persuasive one’s internal logic may be at the time.



So today I am confined to bed. The legs are up. The world has narrowed to the view from my hospital window and the gentle, regimented rhythms of recovery. Having exhausted the available news cycle, including the increasingly surreal business of Donald Trump musing about Greenland and complaining that Norway never gave him a Nobel Peace Prize, I find myself with time. And with time comes reflection.

I realised this morning that I have not written a proper diary entry in a while. Not a piece with an argument, or a framework, or a thesis. Just a record of how things have been. How we got from the 12th of January to now. What this experience has actually felt like, day by day, body and mind together.

And if you are ever going to write a diary entry, surely this is the moment.

My original plan had been to stay at the W Hotel right up until the morning of the 12th. Check out, get a taxi, check into hospital, surgery. That was how it had worked with my previous FFS, so I had simply assumed this would be the same. I had not, as it turns out, checked this assumption with the surgeon.

Bollocks. It was not the same.

He wanted me admitted on the afternoon of the 11th. There are a number of things you have to do before a vaginoplasty that you very much do not have to do before facial surgery, chief among them the rather undignified business of completely emptying out your system. Think colonoscopy-adjacent. Medications, preparation, waiting, and the slow dawning realisation that this is all happening whether you feel ready or not.

So I packed myself up and traipsed from the W Hotel to WIH International Hospital in a taxi. Bangkok taxis continue to confuse me. You sit there watching the meter tick up thinking, surely this cannot be right. Forty-eight? Forty-eight Baht, apparently? Which is basically nothing. I could live like a little princess here, I think. A Cork taxi driver would want €40 euros for this, this cost around €6. I never quite get used to that.

I arrived, checked in, and was taken up to my room. It was exactly the same room I had for my FFS. I vaguely recognised the room number. The view was identical, yes this was the room. The sense of déjà vu was so strong it was almost comic. Saying “déjà vu” doesn’t really cover it. It was more like stepping into a loop.

I walked into the bathroom and there they were: those funny little containers for the shower gel and shampoo. I remembered them instantly. Months ago, after my FFS, I had sat on that very toilet making little videos, slightly swollen, slightly stunned, saying over and over again, “wow… just fucking wow… wow.”

Standing there now, I had this strange, quiet moment of recognition. Same hospital. Same bathroom. Same containers. Entirely different surgery. Entirely different stakes.

After a few hours of settling in, unpacking, and laying out the frankly heroic quantity of food supplies I had brought with me, reality began to set in. This was partly because I know the WIH hospital menu very well by now, and it is not what one might generously describe as expansive.

Each day, a very pleasant woman comes around with a small iPad and invites you to select from the same dreary list of options. The difficulty, for me, was that whenever you are having anything facial done, you are restricted for the first few days to bone broth. Literal bone broth. So even though something like pork fried rice is hardly a culinary event, it shines like a Michelin star when compared to the prospect of three uninterrupted days of broth.

This time, however, there was no ambiguity. Bone broth it was.

“Can I have a smoothie?”

No.

“Can I have a different flavour of bone broth?”

Yes.

Progress.

I was delighted to discover I could choose between chicken and vegetable. I made my selection with the solemnity of someone choosing wallpaper they will be forced to stare at for days.

[Chicken broth and water, 3 days of this](https://preview.redd.it/t4e1l29an3gg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05c0537b6a978a7bb852484a7066a10b16642525)

Shortly afterwards, a nurse appeared carrying two small bottles and a set of instructions on exactly when to take them. This was colonoscopy-adjacent territory. Clean-out territory. The sort of thing that comes with a tone of voice that says, you may not enjoy this, but it is happening regardless.

And dear reader, this stuff works.

I was under strict instructions that by 10 p.m. that night, everything needed to be, shall we say, complete. So complete, in fact, that I was required to take a photograph of the final visit to the toilet. By this point, I had a clear aesthetic target in mind. Chardonnay. That was the goal. Anything darker, and they were going to have to resort to more extreme measures to clean me out, so I was determined.

[Too much information?](https://preview.redd.it/4376qm2dn3gg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6a4c0126245fafe99f6b1acb2f4299a23c7debb)

For the first three hours after taking the prep, nothing happened, which briefly made me anxious that perhaps I was immune. Then the action began. And when I say began, I mean it committed.

I was up and down to the toilet roughly every three minutes for the next three hours. I am not entirely sure I achieved Chardonnay. I definitely, definitely achieved something closer to pear cider. Made with real pear.

Apologies. That was a Stuart Lee reference. But it felt accurate at the time.

I tried, desperately, to get some sleep.

But the clock was ticking, and I knew I was scheduled for surgery at 10 a.m. the next morning. For the first time in days, there was nothing left to do. No logistics. No packing. No instructions to follow. Just me, alone in a hospital room, with my thoughts finally given free rein.

And my mind went everywhere.

Not in the crude, internet sense of “will I regret this?”, because it isn’t that simple. It really isn’t. The question was more fundamental than that. Do I fully understand the profundity of what is about to happen? Am I actually grasping the magnitude of this change, the scale of the shift in my body, my identity, my lived experience?

And then, inevitably, my thoughts narrowed to the most blunt, unpoetic question of all.

How alive is this thing going to be?

Is it inanimate? Is it responsive? What does it feel like? What is it? What am I actually waking up with? I realised, quite suddenly, that I had no reference points at all. No internal model. No analogue. Nothing in my lived experience that could be used as a comparison.

The result was not panic exactly, but something adjacent. A tightening. A slight sense of becoming overclocked. I don’t do this often, but I could feel myself tipping into a kind of internal hyper-alertness. Sleep was now impossible. Absolutely zero chance.

So I got out of bed, trotted down the corridor to the nurses’ desk, and said, very plainly, “I can’t sleep. I’m going to need something.”

They nodded, as if this were the most unsurprising request in the world, and a short while later I was given a tablet. Some sort of benzodiazepine. Xanax, I think. One of those drugs you usually only encounter via adverts for deeply questionable online pharmacies.

Whatever it was, it worked.

The edges softened. The thoughts loosened their grip. And not long after, I fell asleep.

I woke on the morning of the 12th with one very clear priority. I wanted a shower. Desperately. I did not want to spend the next however many days feeling dirty, and if I could claw back even one day of feeling clean, that felt like a small but meaningful victory

[I brought in an armada of food for both the cupboard and the in-room fridge that I remembered from the last time. There was no way I was gonna rely on hospital food this time.](https://preview.redd.it/detg3z9nn3gg1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7eb06df1920db84f8023808b43180c1dffec358)

The staff had already anticipated this. A nurse brought in a tiny bottle of orange liquid labelled Hibiscrub. I recognised the word instantly. I have no idea why, except that my mother is a retired nurse and was extremely verbose about her work when we were young. Certain words clearly lodged themselves somewhere deep and never left.

So I showered. Carefully. Thoroughly. Washed myself down with the orange liquid and stood there for a moment afterwards, clean and human. I wanted to put on moisturiser, maybe do a few other small rituals, but I hesitated. With cheek implants happening as well, I wasn’t entirely sure what was allowed, so I left it. This was not the morning for improvisation.

Not long after, a nurse returned with a surgical gown. To my mild surprise, it was actually rather decent. None of the humiliating backless nonsense we’re used to at home, with strings that promise dignity but never deliver it. This one was a front-crossover, almost kimono-like, with the hospital logo embroidered on the chest. Proper cotton. Nicely made. I remember thinking, well, this is quite civilised.

On it went. Then the hairnet.

I went into the bathroom, carefully tucked every last inch of hair inside it, and looked at myself one final time. Then I returned to the bed and lay down.

I thought I had a little longer. It was around 9:30, maybe 9:40. I started frantically texting people. “Thirty minutes to go.” “Fifteen minutes to go.”

[I recall sending this image out to a few people 30 minutes before surgery....](https://preview.redd.it/y3lywbzrn3gg1.jpg?width=3011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=891624d602ac107fd08d59826d60bba223dcaa31)

It was not fifteen minutes to go.

The nurse appeared early. “We go, go, go.”

Honestly, that was probably a blessing. Had I gone right to the wire, I think I’d have been far more nervous.

I was wheeled onto the first trolley, taken to the lift. I smiled at the nurses, said goodbye, and we went down from the eighth floor to one of the lower levels, I think the fourth, where the operating theatres live. There’s always that little bump-bump as the trolley crosses the threshold of the lift. I remember staring down the corridor as operating doors slid past, one after another.

This was the fourth time I had gone under for transgender surgery, and I felt calm. Ridiculously calm. I know how odd that sounds, but it felt like, we know this path. I have walked this corridor before. I am prepared for this.

Writing this now, I can feel myself welling up a little.

I knew what was coming.

They wheeled me into the holding area just outside the theatre. The familiar drill began. In came my surgeon. Then the surgical assistant. Then the anaesthetist. Exactly as before.

I recognised the anaesthetist instantly.

“Do you remember me?” he asked.

“Your face is etched into my memory,” I said. “The eyebrows. The smile.”

His English was astonishingly good, which meant I could explain everything in detail. That I wasn’t nervous. That I was fine. That I understood what was happening. And they were, as always in this hospital, incredibly tactile. Someone was stroking my arm. Someone else was reassuring me. “You’ll be fine. We’ve got you.”

I think someone hugged me. I’m not entirely sure, but it wouldn’t surprise me. There is a deep, human warmth here that always catches me slightly off guard.

Then, in the way hospitals always do, something baffling happened. A second trolley, identical to the one I was already lying on, appeared next to me. I shuffled across onto it, thinking, is this some sort of departmental boundary thing? A costing thing? No idea. This always happens. And then off we went.

Inside the theatre now. Things become a little blurrier.

The gown comes off. My arms are extended out to the sides. You always feel vaguely like Jesus on the cross at this point, or a patient in an old asylum being restrained. I give my usual warning about my right shoulder, which has had surgery in the past. It can’t go fully horizontal. They adjust it without fuss. I’m always grateful for that. Otherwise, I live in fear it’ll dislocate mid-procedure.

Then I feel the anaesthetic enter my left arm.

It is icy cold.

And then comes that first heaviness. It’s very hard to describe. Almost like metal flowing over you. Dense. Smothering. A weight that gently presses your consciousness down and away.

And then I’m asleep...



When I came back to myself, it was 10 p.m. I think there must have been a clock on the wall opposite me, but I registered the time very quickly, and with it a single, slightly dislocated thought: that was a long time. It felt as though an enormous stretch of time had passed, and yet nothing had happened at all.

I didn’t feel altered. I didn’t feel different. I didn’t feel like anything had been done to me.

I remember falling back asleep, then waking again, over and over, with the persistent conviction that nothing had occurred. That I had simply been unconscious, paused, parked somewhere outside of time. At some point, perhaps a couple of hours later, I became aware of vague sensations in my face. A sort of scrunching feeling around my cheeks. Slight numbness. A hint of pain. And I remember thinking, oh, they’ve at least done my cheeks.

Then I noticed something else.

My lower body wasn’t moving. It couldn’t move.

And then I remembered the nerve block.

This had been optional. An extra. I had paid for it. The explanation was that it would make the first couple of days dramatically easier in terms of pain, and that I wouldn’t feel anything from the waist down. Knowing that intellectually and experiencing it are two very different things. The absence of sensation was total. Not numbness exactly, but absence. As though that entire region of my body had been politely switched off.

I don’t have much conscious memory from this period, and I’m very keen not to do it an injustice by inventing detail where there is none. What I do vaguely remember is being wheeled back into my room, and that deep, unmistakable sense of stillness when the trolley finally stops rattling through corridors and lift shafts and comes to rest.

IVs were connected. More morphine was administered. After that, everything becomes foggy again.

The 13th of January exists mostly as a blank.

My only clear memories from that day are oddly abstract ones. The knowledge that I felt nothing. That the pain was entirely blocked. That I couldn’t really move. And that I was safe. We’ve been here before, I remember thinking. This is familiar territory.

There was a nurse with me constantly, twenty-four hours a day. In the early stages, this is a godsend. I always come here alone. There is no family member sitting by the bed, no partner, no relative. Nobody. And so, quietly and kindly, the hospital assigns someone to fill that role. She did everything a loved one might have done. Watching. Helping. Being present.

I drank water constantly. I’m very good at that. And she was equally good at replenishing it. Another bottle. More water. Another bottle. More water.

Then came the bone broth. So thin it could be drunk through a straw.

I have very little memory of any of this now.

The 14th of January is also hazy, though I do remember Dr Sahatad coming in with an enormous bunch of flowers and a card that read, Happy birthday, lovely Stevie. He smiled at me, stayed for a while, and brought photographs taken by a professional photographer during my previous visit to Thailand. They are extraordinarily kind to me here.

https://preview.redd.it/r9yiedr5o3gg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e6f1592b5a64b626a3bd7e9f0eb56b3ec8b222d

I remember being told that the nerve block was wearing off now, and that morphine was beginning to take over pain control. If I’m being completely honest, the level of pain remained quite low.

By the 15th of January, things began to sharpen. I started to become Stevie again. Impatient. Restless. Eager to get out of bed. I knew this was the day it would happen, and I was genuinely excited.

I don’t recall the exact time, but I do remember nurses coming in and explaining very carefully how I was to move my legs. They had to stay together. Knees almost pinched. No spreading. That would be very bad for the stitches. I had a vivid mental image of a cushion being torn apart if I did the wrong thing.

I was incredibly tense.

When my feet finally touched the ground, the sensation was extraordinary. My legs felt useless. Heavy. Profoundly fatigued. As though they belonged to someone else. A kind of semi-paralysis.

Nonetheless, I managed to walk unaided, much to the alarm of the nurses. “Careful, careful, careful,” they kept saying as I shuffled towards the bathroom.

All I wanted was the mirror.

https://preview.redd.it/f9c4pef8o3gg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d047da0725167634b88a389ac43196cc50769d5d

I needed to see what state I was in. What they had done to me. This felt like a liberation. It meant I could brush my teeth properly. Stand. Exist upright.

Over the next couple of days, normality returned slowly. Incrementally. By the 17th of January, I was no longer acutely ill. I was… killing time. That odd phase of hospitalisation where you are neither patient nor person, just someone waiting.

That was also the day my nurse asked, “Is there anything you want from the shop?”

Coffee. Oh my God, coffee.

The fatal mistake was noticing the word coffee on the hospital menu once it reopened a little. I ordered one. It arrived. Ice cold. Thai-style iced coffee. I hate cold coffee. I was devastated.

She eventually managed to secure me a packet of instant Nescafé, a slightly elevated version rather than the absolute bottom rung. I asked her to put about five spoons into a small cup. It tasted terrible. It was glorious. Caffeine had returned to my bloodstream.

From there, I began to improvise. I remembered the tricks from my last visit. You can order boiled eggs. If you are clever enough to also acquire a green salad and some dressing from the 7-Eleven around the corner, you have instantly hacked together a respectable meal.

By the 18th, I was probably consuming far more calories than I ever would at home. That’s hospital life. There is nothing else to do, so you make friends with the packets of Werther’s Originals on the bedside table.

I got my laptop open. Worked out YouTube on the TV. The days blurred together. Endless Harry and Paul. Far too much Sky News. Tiny Desk concerts. David Bowie. Prince. A failed attempt to rewatch Three Body Problem before remembering halfway through that it descends into utter nonsense.

At some point, I started thinking about Substack. About doing something marginally more constructive than this endless YouTube festival. I began drafting a few pieces. Some too esoteric. Some simply not very good. The drugs were clearly still interfering.

And then, on the 18th of January, the nurses came in and told me the drain was coming out.

I hate drain removals.

I have hated them ever since I was sixteen and had one removed from my shoulder after reconstruction surgery. It was agony. It was Live Aid. Francis Rossi was singing Rockin’ All Over the World. I was screaming all over the ward. Ever since then, drains have lived in my nervous system.

This one, thankfully, wasn’t too bad.

But it gave me my first proper view of what was there.

And that was the day everything was unveiled.

Once everyone had left the room, I sat there and began to write. Immediately. Almost frantically. I wanted to capture the moment because it was the most profound thing that has ever happened to me. And, if I’m honest, because I was quietly terrified of what I now had downstairs, and of the overwhelming significance of it all.

I realised that if I spent a couple of hours writing, I could delay looking again for a little while longer.

What follows is a separate, standalone essay, written at the time, about the great reveal. It is deeply personal. I hope it isn’t too much. I’ve read it back many times since.

This is it...

# Today was the day I was finally going to meet my vagina.

It didn’t begin ceremonially. It began with lunch.

I was sitting in my hospital room, eating, when a nurse came in and asked if I’d finished. I said yes, and she said, very simply, “I’ll call the surgeon now.” There was no buildup, no dramatic pause. And then, within what felt like barely two minutes, the door opened and in they all came.

The surgeon first, followed by a small group of nurses, calm and purposeful, and with them Sally. She was there in a professional capacity, part of a medical consultancy making a film, something I had already agreed to be part of. I knew her already. We weren’t strangers. She came straight to my side and took my hand, and encouraging me the whole time. That mattered more than I realised it would.

As they came in through the door, I already knew the drill. When you first arrive in hospital, you’re a bit coy about getting naked. That disappears quickly. I didn’t hesitate. I just said, “Shall I get naked?” They said yes.

So I did.

I stood there with three nurses, completely unselfconscious, while they admired my boobs and told me how fucking amazing they were. They are pretty fucking amazing. I’m much less coy now because I know that when I get naked, there isn’t going to be a penis anywhere. That knowledge changes everything.

They instructed me to lie back on the bed and spread my legs apart, so I did.

This was my hospital room. My bed. My lunch tray was still nearby. And this was apparently the moment.

And then they began removing the dressings.

There was something wrapped around me that reminded me vaguely of what a sumo wrestler wears, a broad, crescent-shaped band holding everything in place. There were plasters running all the way up my stomach, and as they peeled them back it actually hurt. Not sharply, but insistently. I noticed it.

https://preview.redd.it/721xuqveo3gg1.jpg?width=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dfe78cda056b473bb3446407cfda0bf263925ba

Then I felt the whole moon-shaped band come away.

And with it came something I hadn’t expected at all. I felt fresh air there. Down there, in a place I had never felt fresh air before.

Then I felt a finger touch something I had never felt before either. “Wow”, “jesus”, “THAT’s sensitive”.

At that point, the number of holy fucks increased. I was just repeating it over and over, quietly and uncontrollably, holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck, as sensation arrived before I had any words for it.

And then someone handed me a mirror.

At first all I could see in it was the bed. I lifted it slowly, inch by inch, almost ceremonially, as if I might frighten something if I moved too quickly. The whole time, without planning to, I kept repeating the same words under my breath, like a mantra that had arrived fully formed: holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck.

As the angle changed and the mirror finally caught my body, I realised something unexpected. You don’t really see your own vagina the way you imagine you will. You don’t see everything. From that vantage point, what you see is the smooth rise of the pubic area, the gentle mound of bone and flesh, the suggestion of something deeply intimate rather than a clear, explicit view of it. That surprised me. I see now how little of your own vagina you ever truly see.

Nothing looked shocking. Nothing looked like a war zone. It was swollen, yes, tender and new, but unmistakably a vagina. My body did not recoil. My mind did not panic. I just lay there, still murmuring holy fuck, trying to understand that this was no longer an idea, no longer a future hope, but something real and attached to me.

As they cleaned me, they touched a place near the top, and my breath caught before I could stop it. I gasped. It was completely involuntary. The surgeon said, “That’s your clitoris. Can you feel everything?” And I said yes, because I could. Holy fuck I could feel it clearly. He said I had very good sensation, and I believed him immediately, not because he said it, but because my body already knew. Oh wow!!

What surprised me most was how diffuse the sensation was. It wasn’t just one point. It wasn’t sharp or isolated. It spread. The skin around it felt alive, responsive, warm. A kind of glowy, cosy pleasure that didn’t demand anything from me. It simply existed. I could already sense where pleasure lived, and that recognition alone felt extraordinary.

They put a small panty pad in place, almost comically ordinary, and that was it. Apart from the catheter, there was nothing dramatic about the moment. I was just lying there, in my hospital room, with a pad, in my body.

Later, even thinking about it, I noticed something else. Just imagining being touched there made me feel warm again. Not aroused in a frantic or external way, but lit from within. A quiet, glowing sexual happiness that seemed to come from my centre rather than from something happening to me. Pleasure no longer felt like something hanging off me, separate and awkward. It felt integrated. On me. In me. Part of my core.

I had been surprisingly ambivalent about vaginoplasty before all of this. I knew it mattered, but I hadn’t allowed myself to imagine loving the result. Now I think I am going to really like having this body part. It feels like a lovely thing to have. Not because of what it represents, but because of how it feels to exist with it.

What changed most, though, wasn’t anatomical. It was something quieter and deeper. I no longer felt like I had to excuse my femininity, justify it, explain it, soften it for others. I wasn’t trying to be feminine. I simply was. I have a feminine body. I have feminine genitalia. My body was no longer arguing with my mind. Something long unresolved went quiet.

I don’t yet have perfect language for what that means. I keep wanting to say it was profound, and maybe that word is overused, but I don’t have a better one yet. What I know is this. Something fundamental settled. Something that had been suspended for decades finally came to rest.

And I met myself there.

# I’ve just read that back. Wow

And I’ll be honest, there is a slightly vertiginous feeling in having to continue after something like that. How do you follow a moment that profound without trivialising it? That was an extraordinary day for me. One I suspect I will never really top. And yet time, inconveniently, does not stop.

Since I wrote those words, life has continued. The catheter has been removed. And with all the knowledge in the world that this is a far less poetic moment, I can report, with some confidence, that having a catheter removed from a vagina is noticeably less unpleasant than having one removed from a penis. There is simply less distance for it to travel. This feels like an important data point.

The first thing I wanted to do afterwards was put on knickers that did not look like they belonged to my nana.

I had a matching black Victoria’s Secret bra and bottoms set tucked away, and I put them on together, quietly, like I was getting away with something. I stood in front of the mirror and just stared. I genuinely could not believe this was me. A huge, almost incandescent glow came over me. This can’t be real. And then immediately, what if it is?

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!19bG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F196bc9ee-fc51-4456-aafb-06ffce14bf0a_3024x4032.jpeg)

A small, suspicious part of my brain went looking for the downside. Maybe I look ridiculous. Maybe I actually do look ridiculous. What if this is some sort of elaborate dream? What if it isn’t as good as I think it is?

And then another, calmer voice answered: I don’t care. You can’t take this away from me.

I took a few photographs. Just for me. For posterity. I sent a couple of silly videos to people I trust. And then, inevitably, reality knocked on the door again.

The nurses returned with a reminder. I had about four hours to produce some urine. No wee-wee meant catheter. And at that point, I had barely drunk anything, because earlier I’d been trying to avoid the exact opposite problem. I had only just started properly hydrating.

And then I remembered something else I had completely forgotten.

I had agreed to be filmed.

https://preview.redd.it/06k9m9nlo3gg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d49040490d251bcd426ddc8740368cf49b90fe0

In marched a small documentary crew, which in 2026 terms means a few people, some very compact equipment, and an astonishing ability to fill a hospital room. For the next ninety minutes I answered questions, smiled, and did that peculiar documentary thing where you are asked to walk slowly from one place to another so they can cut it in later, all while a small, increasingly anxious part of my brain was thinking, I really need to drink some water or someone is going to reinsert a tube into me.

Once they left, I got serious.

Bottle after bottle of water. I think I was on my fourth 500ml bottle when I noticed something. Not a desperate urge, not the old familiar alarm bell, but a subtler signal. Do I want a wee? I genuinely wasn’t sure.

Someone explained to me that everything down there is rewired now. The old signal might not fire the same way. You may not feel it, but you probably should try.

So I did.

I sat on the toilet. And within about thirty seconds, I was weeing.

Holy God.

If yesterday was profound, today was its strange, absurd little cousin. I am one of the few people on earth who has spent decades standing up, holding a penis, and weeing out of it. And now the sensation was coming from somewhere entirely different. Much lower than I expected. Nearer to my arse than seemed anatomically plausible. I briefly found myself wondering how women’s bodies fit all of this into such a small area. There doesn’t seem to be the real estate.

What surprised me most was the sensation of relief, or rather the lack of it. As a man, the relief begins immediately. As a woman, it didn’t arrive until about halfway through. It felt unfamiliar. Odd. Not worse, just different. And since then, every trip has been the same. I’m sure I’ll learn it. I already feel like I’m beginning to understand the new signals.

I also noticed something else. When I went for a short walk outside earlier, I wanted to go afterwards, but I felt I could hold it. Properly hold it. There was no panic. No urgency. That alone feels like a small miracle.

And that brings me back to the present.

It’s 19:58 on the 20th of January. Donald Trump is still talking about Greenland. I am as baffled now as I was this morning. Is the President of the United States genuinely contemplating invading the territory of another sovereign NATO member and simply taking the land? It feels no different, in principle, from what Russia has done in Ukraine. I find myself rubbing my eyes at the news, wondering how this can possibly be real. The world appears to have lost its grip on itself.

In more immediate terms, I have two more full days in hospital.

After that, I move to the apartment I’ve rented. I’ve just been sent the access details: passwords, codes, instructions, all very automated. It turns out it’s on the thirty-third floor of a tower. The view, I’m told, should be spectacular. I hope so. My vertigo is already bracing itself. I hope I can actually enjoy it rather than spend a week clinging to the walls.

Work resumes on Thursday. I have a presentation to give to what is still called the Design Authority on the 28th, trying to get a piece of software over the line. My attention will turn back to diagrams, arguments, trade-offs, and delivery schedules. Life, such as it is, reasserts itself.

Normal life begins.

Only now, it begins with me fully inside it.

I went because my friend wouldn’t stop talking about “the town.”

He said it the way people say the mall, the diner, the spot. Like everyone’s supposed to know. Like it’s a rite of passage if you live within driving distance of the mountains.

“It’s not even that far,” he told me for the third time that week, leaning on my passenger window while I was trying to pump gas. “Old mining town. Abandoned. Still has stuff left behind. Tools. Cans. Maybe signs. And it’s supposed to be haunted.”

I made a face. “Haunted by what. Miners with pickaxes?”

He grinned like I’d walked into it. “Exactly.”

He was the kind of guy who could make you say yes to things without trying that hard. Not in a manipulative way. More like… he’d already decided it was going to be fun, and you didn’t want to be the person who wasn’t fun.

Also, if I’m being honest, I’d had a rough month. Too much screen time, too many nights falling asleep with my phone on my chest, the usual modern rot. A day in the mountains sounded like a reset.

So on a Saturday morning, we met up with coffee and a cheap breakfast sandwich, and we drove.

The last stretch was gravel road and patches of snow in the shade even though it was spring. The kind of road that makes your car sound like it’s complaining. The kind of place where you pass one rusted “NO SERVICES” sign and you start doing mental math on how far you are from cell signal.

He had the directions on his phone, but when it dropped to no bars he didn’t even blink. He’d printed a screenshot like it was 2009.

“See?” he said, tapping the paper. “We’re basically there.”

The abandoned town wasn’t marked with a sign. There was just a break in the trees where the road widened into a flat, rocky area—like a turnout that used to be a parking lot before the forest decided it wanted it back.

From there, you could see it: low shapes half-swallowed by brush, collapsed roofs, the dull angle of a corrugated metal building, a line of poles that used to carry power but now just stood there like dead matchsticks.

It didn’t look haunted.

It looked forgotten.

We parked and stepped out. The air was cold enough to bite your ears, but the sun had that bright, clean mountain glare. Everything smelled like pine and damp earth, and somewhere far off there was running water.

He hopped around the car, already excited, like we’d just rolled up to an amusement park.

“You ready?” he asked.

“I’m ready to be disappointed,” I said, and he laughed.

We started in what used to be the main strip, if you could call it that. A dirt road cutting between a handful of buildings. Most of them were just frames now. Weathered boards, broken windows, doors hanging from one hinge.

There were old goods, technically. Empty tin cans. Rusted nails. A cracked wash basin. An iron stove with its door open like a jaw.

He kept pointing things out like artifacts. “Look at this—branding iron. Old bottles. Dude, that’s a ledger.”

He was right about the ledger. It was wedged in a drawer that had half-fallen out of a desk inside one of the buildings. The pages were swollen from moisture. The ink had bled into soft lines.

He didn’t touch it. He just leaned in and took pictures, like he knew the unspoken rule: take only photos.

That’s when he mentioned the hiker.

He did it casually, like he’d been holding it back until the mood was right.

“You heard about that guy that went missing?” he asked.

I glanced at him. “What guy.”

He tucked his phone away and lowered his voice, like the trees might listen. “Last summer. Hiker went off-trail near here. They did a search. Dogs and everything. Nothing. People online said he’d been posting photos, like… ‘I found a ghost town,’ stuff like that.”

I snorted. “People go missing in the woods all the time.”

“Yeah,” he said, and his tone shifted a little. Less excited. “But this one was close enough to this place that—”

“That you wanna LARP as a rescue mission,” I finished.

He smiled, but it didn’t quite land. “I just wanna see if it’s real. Like… if there’s anything here. Any sign someone’s been camping or—”

“Or you wanna be the guy who finds the spooky clue,” I said.

He held up his hands. “Okay, yeah. Maybe.”

We kept moving.

There was a general store with the front wall mostly gone. Inside, shelves were tipped over. A cash register sat on the floor, half-buried in dust and mouse droppings. The glass display cases had been shattered long ago.

As we walked through, I felt that quiet pressure you get in places that used to hold a lot of voices. Like the air remembers.

Then I saw something that made me stop.

A handprint.

Not on a wall. On a pane of glass still clinging to a window frame. Dust-covered, but the print was clean, as if someone had pressed their palm there recently.

Five fingers. Normal size. A smear at the base, like someone slid their hand downward.

“Hey,” I said. “That—”

My friend leaned in. “Sick. Someone’s been here.”

“Recently,” I added.

He shrugged like that didn’t matter. “People explore. That’s the point.”

We moved on, and I told myself not to start doing that thing where my brain manufactures a threat because it wants the story to be better.

But then I saw the first thing that didn’t fit.

It was just a flicker in my peripheral vision. To the left, between two buildings, deep in the shadow.

It looked like… fingers.

Longer than they should’ve been.

And dark at the tips, like they were stained.

I turned my head fast and saw nothing.

Just a slat of broken fence and brush and a hanging strip of cloth that might’ve been part of a curtain.

“You good?” my friend asked.

“Thought I saw something,” I said.

“A bear?” he said, sounding excited again.

“No,” I said, because the word bear didn’t match what my body had done. My body hadn’t gone “predator.”

It had gone wrong.

We kept walking, and I kept glancing at the gaps between buildings like I’d left something behind.

We found the school after about twenty minutes, farther down the dirt road where the town thinned out. It was a low building with a collapsed roof on one side and a busted bell tower that leaned at an angle that made me want to step away from it.

The front doors were gone. Inside, the hallway was open to the sky in places where the roof had caved. Sunlight fell in hard rectangles on the floor.

We walked in anyway, because curiosity is a disease.

There were old desks—some stacked, some broken. A chalkboard still clung to one wall, stained and blank. A row of hooks for coats. Someone had painted a faded alphabet above them.

It felt like the kind of place that should’ve had kids’ voices, and not having them made the silence heavy.

We sat outside the school on the broken front steps to drink water and snack. He pulled out his phone and started taking pictures like it was a tourist stop.

“Hold up,” he said. “Get in one.”

“No,” I said. “I’m not posing in front of a haunted school.”

“It’s not haunted,” he said, smiling. “It’s history.”

I rolled my eyes and stood anyway, because he wasn’t going to let it go.

He stepped back and framed the shot. “Okay, look just past me. Like you’re thinking about how sad it is.”

“Shut up,” I said, but I did it.

He snapped a couple photos. Then he did one of us together, leaning in with his arm around my shoulder, both of us grinning like idiots.

“Perfect,” he said, scrolling.

Then his smile faded slightly.

“What?” I asked.

He turned the screen toward me.

At first I didn’t see it. Just us, the school behind us, the hallway dark.

Then I saw the two white dots.

They were in the background, deep in the hallway darkness, symmetrical like eyes. Not reflective like animal eyes that catch a flash. These looked like they were lit from inside. Clean white circles, too round.

My throat tightened.

“Probably a raccoon,” my friend said quickly.

“In a school hallway,” I said.

“They’ll go anywhere,” he said, but it sounded like he was trying to convince himself. He tapped the screen, zoomed in, and the image blurred. The dots stayed.

“Maybe it’s dust,” he said. “Or like, lens flare.”

“It’s in the shadow,” I said.

He locked his phone and shoved it into his pocket with too much force. “Okay. So we leave. Happy?”

I was about to say yes—yes, let’s leave, let’s go back to the car and pretend this was just a creepy photo—when I heard it.

Not a scream.

A sound like crying.

Soft, broken, like someone trying to breathe through it.

It came from deeper in the town, beyond the school, where the trees were thicker and the buildings were less intact.

My friend froze, mid-step.

We looked at each other.

“Did you—” he started.

The crying stopped.

The silence that followed felt… staged. Like someone had turned the sound off.

Then we heard it again, farther away. Softer. Like it was moving, or like it wanted us to think it was.

My friend swallowed. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, we’re leaving.”

We started walking back toward the main strip, fast but not running. Running would’ve felt like admitting we were scared, and pride is another disease.

As we walked, I kept catching glimpses of movement at the edge of the buildings. Not clear shapes. Just a shift. A shadow that didn’t line up with the sun.

Then we heard something else.

A scream—this time not a woman. It sounded like pain. Like a person being hurt.

It was short and jagged, cut off abruptly, like someone had been grabbed mid-sound.

My friend stopped and turned his head like he was trying to triangulate it. “That’s… that’s not—”

“It’s not real,” I said, but it came out weak.

Because the scream had sounded real in the way your brain recognizes whether something is performed or not.

My friend’s hand went to his pocket like he was checking his phone. No signal, obviously, but he did it anyway. “We should call—”

“Later,” I said. “Get to the car.”

We hit the general store again, and I saw something that made my blood go cold.

The clean handprint on the glass was gone.

Not smeared.

Gone like the dust had been disturbed over it, wiped away.

As if someone didn’t want us staring at it anymore.

I kept walking.

We rounded a corner between two buildings and I saw it again—this time not just fingers.

A hand, fully, gripping the edge of a wall.

Long knuckles. Pale skin, almost gray in the shadow.

And the nails—

They looked like claws. Not sharp like a cat’s. Thick and cracked, dark at the tips like dried blood.

I saw it for less than a second.

Then it withdrew.

I stopped so hard my friend almost bumped into me. “Did you see that?”

He looked at me, eyes wide. “Yeah.”

That was all he said.

That “yeah” had weight.

We didn’t talk after that. We just walked faster, trying not to look like we were running, even though every nerve in my body wanted to explode into sprinting.

The crying started again behind us.

Closer.

Not loud. Just persistent. Like it was following at a pace that didn’t require effort.

We passed the school again and I looked into the hallway without wanting to.

The two white dots weren’t there.

The hallway was darker than it should’ve been for this time of day, like the light had drained out of it.

I could smell something faint and sour—like wet pennies, like meat left too long.

My friend whispered, “Don’t look.”

We walked.

We walked.

Then the town went quiet in a new way, like even the wind stopped moving through the gaps in the buildings. The silence pressed in so hard it made my ears ring.

And then I heard footsteps behind us.

Not ours.

Not crunching like boots on gravel.

More like something dragging its weight through dirt, then pausing. Like it was listening.

My friend’s breathing changed. He glanced over his shoulder and didn’t slow down, but his whole body tightened.

“Don’t,” I whispered.

“I have to know,” he whispered back.

He looked over his shoulder again.

Whatever he saw made his face drain.

He didn’t scream. He didn’t swear. He just whispered, “Oh my god.”

Then he ran.

He broke into a full sprint, and my body followed before my brain caught up, because when the person next to you bolts, your survival instinct doesn’t ask questions.

We ran toward the turnout where the car was parked. The path wasn’t straight. We had to weave between buildings and brush and fallen beams.

Behind us, the crying became a sound I can’t describe without my stomach turning.

It wasn’t crying anymore.

It was something mimicking crying, like it had learned the shape of that sound but not the meaning. It turned into a wet, breathy thing with these little jerky breaks, like laughter trying to be sorrow.

Then, above it, that screech.

The same kind of screech you hear in horror movies and roll your eyes at because it’s too much.

In real life, it’s not “too much.”

It’s too true.

My foot caught on a piece of wood and I stumbled, catching myself before I fell. My friend was ahead of me now, maybe fifteen feet. He was looking back, running blind.

“Don’t look!” I yelled.

He looked anyway.

That’s when it hit him.

It didn’t pounce like an animal. It didn’t tackle him like a person.

It came out of the gap between buildings like it unfolded from the shadow, and it moved with this awful smooth speed, like it didn’t have to obey the same rules of momentum we do.

My friend went down hard.

He hit the dirt on his side and rolled, trying to scramble up, his hands flailing for purchase.

He screamed then—one sharp, shocked sound.

I stopped, because my brain did the stupid heroic thing where it tries to rewrite the ending.

I ran toward him.

I saw the creature, full, for the first time.

It looked like an emaciated deer, but not in any way that felt natural. No fur. Skin stretched tight over bone, pale gray like old ash. Its spine and ribs were too visible, like it had been starving for years. Its legs were long and jointed wrong in places, and its hooves—if they were hooves—were split and cracked like they’d been forced into shape.

Its head was the worst part.

It was deer-like in outline, but the face was wrong. The muzzle looked peeled back, too much bone showing. The mouth opened wider than it should have, not full of neat teeth, but jagged, uneven teeth like broken glass set into gum.

And the eyes.

Not animal eyes.

Those two white dots I saw in the photo weren’t reflections. They were the thing’s eyes, and they were blank and bright like dropped coins.

It looked at me and held my gaze for a second too long.

Like it was deciding if I was worth the effort.

I shouted. I don’t even remember what I shouted. Something useless.

It didn’t flinch.

It snapped its head toward my friend, who was trying to crawl backward on his elbows.

Then it moved again.

One fast step.

A blur of pale limbs.

My friend’s scream turned into a sound of pain that cut off halfway through like someone had shut a door on it.

I saw his legs kick once. Twice.

Then nothing.

I stood there frozen, my brain refusing to accept that the person I’d eaten breakfast with an hour ago was suddenly… gone in the most final way.

The creature’s head turned back to me.

It tilted, like it was curious.

And then it came for me.

I ran.

I ran so hard I couldn’t feel my lungs. I ran like the ground was pulling away under my feet. I ran toward the turnout, toward the car, toward any place that wasn’t behind me.

Something hit my back.

Not a full body slam.

Just the tips of those claws raking across me like it was testing how deep it could cut.

Pain exploded across my shoulder blades. Hot and tearing. It stole my breath and made my vision blur.

I stumbled but didn’t fall. I kept running.

I heard the creature behind me—its footsteps didn’t sound like hooves. They sounded like wet wood snapping.

I made it to the turnout and saw the car like a miracle, parked where we left it. Sunlight hit the windshield and for a stupid second it looked normal, like this could still be a story about exploring an old mining town and laughing about a creepy photo later.

I fumbled the keys out with shaking hands.

I hit the unlock button. The car beeped.

I yanked the driver’s door open and dove in.

My friend—his seat—was empty, the way it should be, and that made my throat tighten because it shouldn’t be.

I slammed the door, shoved the key into the ignition, and turned.

The engine coughed once, like it was offended at being asked to work.

Then it started.

I threw the car into reverse without looking and backed up hard enough that gravel sprayed. The tires spun, then caught.

As I swung the car around, I looked up.

The creature stood at the edge of the turnout, half in the trees. It wasn’t charging the car. It wasn’t frantic.

It was watching.

Its ribs rose and fell slowly, like it had all the time in the world. Like it could wait for me to make a mistake. Like it knew roads didn’t matter as much as people think.

Then it opened its mouth.

And the sound it made wasn’t a screech this time.

It was a sob.

A perfect sob.

A human one.

The same type of broken cry I’d heard earlier.

It came out of that mouth like a practiced line.

I hit the gas so hard my foot cramped.

The car lurched forward and I tore down the gravel road, bouncing over ruts, not caring what it did to my suspension. My back burned with every movement, and when I lifted my shirt at the first straightaway, my fingers came away wet.

Blood.

I drove until I hit cell signal and didn’t even realize I’d been holding my breath the whole time until my phone chimed with a notification like it had just woken up.

I pulled over and called 911 so fast I fumbled the digits.

When the operator answered, my voice came out wrong—too high, too tight.

I told them where we were. I told them my friend was gone. I told them something attacked us and I knew how it sounded and I didn’t care.

They asked what the attacker looked like.

I said, “Like a deer,” and I hated myself for it, because it sounded insane.

But then I added, “No fur. Gray skin. Wrong mouth. Eyes like… like headlights.”

I heard the change in the operator’s breathing. That moment when someone is trying to stay professional while their brain goes “what.”

They said deputies were on the way. Search and rescue, too.

I sat on the side of the road with my shirt pressed to my back, shaking, watching the tree line like it could step out anywhere.

Hours later, a deputy took my statement and an EMT cleaned and bandaged the claw marks. Four long cuts across my upper back. Not deep enough to kill me. Deep enough to prove I wasn’t just making it up.

Search and rescue went out there that afternoon.

They didn’t find my friend.

They found the town, of course. They found our footprints. They found the school.

They found the spot where he went down.

There was blood.

There were drag marks.

Then the drag marks stopped in a patch of brush like the earth had swallowed him.

They also told me something else, quietly, like they didn’t want me to hear it.

There was a missing hiker report near that town. More than one, if you went back far enough. People who stepped off trail. People who followed a sound. People who went looking for “a place.”

I asked if they thought the mining town had anything to do with it.

The deputy didn’t answer directly. He just looked at me for a long second and said, “Don’t go back.”

I haven’t.

But sometimes, when my phone shows me old photos the way it likes to—little “memories” it thinks I want—I see that school picture again.

And I zoom in.

And I look at the two white dots in the dark.

And I think about how my friend said, Probably a raccoon.

And I think about how fast “probably” becomes “too late” out there.

Because the last thing that creature did—before I hit the gas and left my friend behind in that town—was cry like a person.

Not because it was sad.

Because it knew it worked.",0,1769610655.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,0.5,False
