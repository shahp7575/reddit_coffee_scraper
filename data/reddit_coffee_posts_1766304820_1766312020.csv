I’ll find it strains and tightens my voice to the point where I’m not speaking from a relaxed place so have to just push through loud social situations. When the hernia feels okay I notice my voice is deeply relaxed and sonorous. So it’s almost like I have two personalities and can make socialising a bit hit and miss. It also just tenses up my body if it’s bad. After observing my diet and lifestyle over many years I haven’t found any key triggers other than potentially anxiety which causes
 it to flare. I can drink 3 coffees and still not have a serious flare. I’m in good shape, always been healthy weight. 30 year old guy but I’ve dealt with this for as long as I can remember.

I'm so tired. I'm so burnt out. Nothing is going right. Nothings working.


I tried to clean out my room today and just stood in front of my dresser for an entire hour opening and closing drawers because I couldn't make any decisions and my brain was spinning and a million miles a minute and I couldn't focus and j just got nothing done. I kept thinking about making more coffee but I have already had 4 today and it was only 3pm by that point.


My acne is terrible, my hair is falling out. I haven't had a period in almost 2 years. 


My brother called me today and I yelled at him for calling me. I hate how I look in the mirror but my workouts never go well because I'm always exhausted and im always starving so I always want to eat and then the cycle repeats.


In the past year I've had severe food poisoning (reached a high of 26 occurrences of diarrhea in 24 hours), was robbed, get catcalled daily, fractured a bone in my foot and had to limp for 2 weeks, and have gotten an average of probably 5 hours per night of sleep (usually I go to bed at around 8 or 9, wake up 3ish times, and then wake up at around 3).


It's like the stress just comes from all directions and it never ends. I have severe anxiety that often feels very physical and painful, usually in my chest like I need to just start running or something.


I really don't know whats wrong with me or how to stop this.


What can I do??

1ps343l,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1ps343l/parents_that_dont_respect_your_belongings_rant/,parents that don’t respect your belongings (rant),"this is mostly about my mother, but my dad enables it. one thing that happened recently is for a rare instance, we were gonna have company over. my mother absolutely lost her mind cleaning the house, and even started paying for a storage unit that very day just to shove a bunch of stuff into… because she was that embarrassed of the house. (which is quite gross.) anyway…. she does that shit. she’ll gripe about how there’s “so much” clutter and nonsense everywhere, but it’s like… most of this stuff is yours? also, the house isn’t unreasonably filled with stuff, it’s actually a pretty healthy amount of stuff. but still she will just move shit around and won’t tell you where anything is.

i had a bin of clothes my partner gave to me and i just went to wash them, and now the bin is gone. i have no idea where it is. they probably shoved it in the storage unit when i wasn’t looking, and then will act like im completely unhinged if i get upset because they blatantly disrespect me and and mess with my stuff all the time. i tell them don’t mess with my laundry, they still do. i say please dont move that, and they do. i can only be polite about it for so long

also, my mother threw away an old (useable) coffee pot of mine (that was gifted to me, mind you) and excusing it by saying “oh well it was gross, you weren’t gonna use it” when i, in fact, was gonna clean and use it. i was cool about it but thinking back on it, how entitled and fucking cruel does someone have to be to just throw your shit away and assume how you feel about your own stuff? they constantly violate your requests and boundaries, and then act like you’re crazy if you get upset or show any negative feeling. my parents (but especially my father) get uncomfortable when i’m upset, and will say or do anything to avoid the actual core of any issue

generally though, staying with them fucking blows. i might go and try to stay with a friend or move in with my partner again (but that situation involves other people and it’s complicated.) i’ve been doing anything i can to just cope with all this. realizing all this emotional neglect stuff only happened this year, and i get these waves of feelings and i really just need to get stuff off my chest. it’s a lot to carry. and it’s lonely. not to mention most of my relationships feel destabilized at the moment, including my romantic relationship

i can now see how even i can have a tendency to be dismissive or unengaged during times i should be, but i really do care and i try. i feel like a lot of my family are really judgmental and just stuck in the pattern of being miserable externalizers, while feeling obligated to people and dynamics that only worsen it. a weird thing ive realized is the sort of “role”, or almost “character” that they paint me as. i’m the “golden” one. but also, when convenient, the narrative is that i’m smart, but lazy or unmotivated, that i’m completely reliant on my parents, etc. they give the occasional positive but hollow feeling compliment, only for them to treat me with no respect. they don’t see my progress. they will distort anything to view me negatively",2,1766311313.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

Sharing my real experience using the Scapia Credit Card, especially while travelling.

I’ve used this card on multiple domestic trips recently and the unlimited lounge access alone makes it worth it for frequent flyers. Entry was smooth — no confusion, just show the card and walk in. Helped a lot during early morning and delayed flights.

What I liked more is the new airport privileges they’ve added. On one trip, I redeemed benefits for free coffee, and on another, I saw options like dining vouchers and even spa access at select airports. It’s not flashy marketing — it actually worked for me.

Other things worth mentioning:
	•	❌ No joining fee
	•	❌ No annual fee
	•	Rewards are given as Scapia coins, which I could directly use while booking flights

If anyone is planning to apply, here’s my referral link:
👉 https://apply.scapia.cards/landing_page?referral_code=jg5xu9

Using this link gives 1,000 coins on joining. Also, for December sign-ups, there’s a ₹1,000 discount on your first flight booking (you can book anytime within the first month).

Not forcing anyone — just sharing because it’s been genuinely useful for me.

1ps3344,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ps3344,Touched Starved & Intellectually Starved w/a question - Do Asexual Men Exist?,"** only those who really care about you can hear you when you're quiet**

I am married and so touched deprived that I’ve considered paying someone for a hug. I googled that and that’s when I found out ‘professional cuddlers’ exist. They don’t exist in my area and where they do exist, they don’t come cheap - $150 - $300 hourly.

This might sound weird but it really shouldn’t. Men usually get their emotional needs met through sex. However they feel - stressed, depressed, upset, angry, happy, dopey, bored, hype - sex will temporarily solve it, dull it, or enhance it. This is why the loneliest and depressed guys are usually single and in want of a girlfriend, because they want regular and consistent access to sex. They think their barriers to that lies in looks and money (or lack thereof).

For women, sex (and regular access to it) doesn’t mean she’s getting the intellectual and emotional stimulation she needs. Many (like me) aren’t getting that and men don’t understand why or how it’s related. I tried to be FWB (friends with benefits) to men but that never worked out. Men aren’t interested in women they aren’t physically and sexually attracted to so everyone and anyone who was interested in a FWB with me was sexually attracted, physically attracted, or both. That means they wanted to have sex at some point and the sex (‘benefits’) become more important than the friendship I wanted and needed. I let them go but it was during this time  I learned I’m demisexual and sapiosexual which is on the asexual spectrum. I never fell for anyone based on looks and horniness, I fell for them based on how well we talked, got along, empathized and related to each other. I often bond with folks through shared trauma.

I don’t have male friends for the aforementioned reason. I don’t have female friends for a different reason. Despite matrimony, I’m bereft and marriage comes with certain unwritten rules and stipulations about the company we can keep, especially opposite sex company.

I’m not divorcing. I don’t want to have sex with anyone. I’m no longer looking for friends. I just want more of the experience of having great random conversations with people and immediately continuing that over a cup of coffee and a pastry (my treat) with no other intentions (in Sweden they do this often and gave it a name - fika https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/all-about-swedish-fika/ ). I don’t want to see them anymore after that initial socializing.

Wondering - do asexual men exist who feel the same? No friends, lonely, tired, just want to socialize with someone they can talk to and relate to without the awkwardness and expectation of sex and physical attraction?",2,1766311217.0,BlackMentalHealth,0,1.0,False

One word - habits

The idea that I can shape my life from habits I create was an absolute game changer and the realisation of how effective they can be came when listening to Stephen coveys - the 7 habits of highly effective people 

 

I have followed on in reading many self help books many to do with starting and maintaining habits.

Tiny habits (currently reading really good, I’m about 3/4 through)

Atomic habits

Power of habit 

 These were the best ones I read

Goal setting 

Follow your North Star - Martha Beck 

Can’t recommend this highly enough 

Plenty of books on business and money too 

My habits most effective to me that I’ve managed to make stick

Sleep habits #1 priority

\- off phone and in bed at 9pm

\- set alarm out of arms reach 

\-charge phone downstairs 

\-read a book in bed

\- use sleep mask 

\- drink night time tea

\-use lavender spray on pillow

\-shower before bed

\-no late meals

These aren’t in order and I don’t always use all of them but it definitely helped me to write all this down and it’s on a small whiteboard on my bedroom side. 

Morning routine

Up out of bed (assisted by alarm being other side of room) 

Shit

Wash hands

Turn on shower

Brush teeth (while water warms up)

Shower (nice clean bum) 

Scrub nails in shower after cleaning privates

Dry 

Make bed 

Take last nights clothes off floor

Get dressed

Take vitamins 

Make high protein breakfast (good for meds to last longer)

Take meds 

Take phone

Ready for work 

That routine starts at 6 and I am taking my meds at 7. I’ve had that routine for a while and taking meds fitted in well with breakfast (now high protein) 

Diet 

This isn’t so much a routine but I have found a keto diet was really good for me this correlates with studies in the book ADHD- a hunter in a farmers world. This book says our brains are derived from hunter gatherer societies and the “symptoms” we experience of ADHD are in fact crucial advantages for human survival in the wild. Constant alert for threats and opportunities never solely focusing on one thing so we can go straight to another potentially better solution. Eg. Hunting a boar that runs into bushes and a rabbit runs out, we go straight to the rabbit and our brain is always prepped and ready for that switch of focus. 

So sorry off that tangent on cavemen(sorry about that change in direction my brain went) 

back to diet 

It correlates that a caveman diet is effective I found this in a combination of experiencing it for myself with keto and having the benefits of being more switched on and the idea that we have cavemen brains which work best on a diet rich in protein and fat. 

My diet since seeing this correlation has changed from keto to being what I call a brain boosting diet focusing on foods which are high in brain boosting vitamins and minerals. Funnily enough when you google brain boosting foods, you guessed it, they’re mainly high fat and protein. So here’s my list:

\-Avocado - potassium and fibre

\-Chicken, turkey, beef - tyrosine rich for dopamine

\-olive oil, coconut oil - stable brain fuel

\-full fat yoghurt protein and calcium

\-spinach, kale, broccoli - iron, magnesium, b vitamins

\-berries - improve memory

\- oily fish - omega 3 fatty acids

\- eggs - b6, b12, choline

\-whole grains - steady glucose for focus and concentration 

\-dark chocolate - boost concentration, improve blood flow to brain

From this I often have yogurt and berries for breakfast as it’s quick but salmon and veg is good or split an avocado and put a boiled egg in each pit hole. 

Then main meals are whole grains (brown rice, oats, brown bread etc.) with meat and green leafy veg. Obviously I’m not always restricted to only these foods but it’s a really good base of my diet. 

I often have dark chocolate as a snack or a little treat with some berries. I drink decaf because I don’t do well with caffeine but coffee can be good too. (Can’t remember the benefits as it’s not on my list) 

This info is the best things I can think of that have helped me on this crazy journey so far and I hope it will be supercharged with the medication. I’ve spent so much energy processing everything and hyper focusing or Reddit threads 🤣 I’m not sure what’s going on right now but I’m giving myself Christmas to relax and get my head straight then in the new year I’m aiming for the stars.

The salt is easier because I've always craved salt, but I've always had horrible trouble with hydration. Drinking basically any liquid makes me physically nauseous especially if it's very much at a time, and plain water is the absolute worst. 

Sparkling water is easier and some flavoured waters help a bit. Milk and juice are somewhat easier, as are very sweet coffee/some teas and sodas but I know none of those are the best options, and even then it's very hard to drink large amounts.

I've been trying to make bullion broth more often to help with water and salt both, and it's easier than plain water but still difficult.

Does anyone else have this much struggle, and do you have advice?

(I do want to be clear it's really not just being picky or disliking tastes, trying to push through the nausea just results in throwing up a lot of the time. I also have talked to my dr about it and will continue to do so, I just want to hear what helps for other people.)

To remove the stone, which was stuck quite hard, I opened the machine, and removed the top grinder. Then I cleaned everything well, and closed the machine. 

The grinder assembly rotates as expected without any beans in it (ending with the no beans error). When I add beans, it grinds 2-3 beans and then stops spinning. The brew process finishes without error, but the coffee brewed is of course just some brown water. 

So then I thought, maybe the motor is broken because ot is no longer spinning (strange because I hear the motor still). I have changed the grinder motor, but the problem is still not solved. Grinder will not grind beans. 

I read on Whole Latte Love that machine may need to be ‘reprogrammed’ by brewing 18-24 shots. So I tried that, but the issue still persists. 

I wonder what else might be causing this issue: is the white plastic gear whee linking worm drive to grinder assembly? Although it looks to be quite ok and undamaged. Is the Hall effect sensor faulty?

I just published my first independent paper from my former PhD advisor.

I began writing this paper over half a year ago. I explicitly asked him whether he believed it was a good idea working on it, and he was fully supportive, saying I had to start being more independent. I also explained in detail what the content, ideas and organisation of the manuscript would be. Not asking for feedback, since I considered this to be a trial of fire for myself, but rather to be fully transparent with him. Again, he was supportive. I've casually chatted with him over the review rounds, the journals and every step of the process. He had not read the manuscript, but he did not seem concerned about it, nor did he ask me to send it to him at any given step. He even insisted he would retire in 1 or 2 years and he didn't care about publications that much anymore.

Fast forward to the day I had the proofs, he congratulated me. And today, the preprint of the manuscript is published, and he got mad and broke up with me. Apparently, I had published ideas we've talked about while having coffees, and working on this was unethical. Whether this is true or not is beyond the point here, because I too could make a very strong point that many of these ideas where matured by myself. After all, the chosen narrative, methods, data and basically everything related to this specific paper I did completely on my own.

Everyone I've talked with about this is shocked. On the one hand, they find the change of mind confusing to say the least. Regardless of having read the manuscript or not before, as I mentioned he was fully aware of the contents of the manuscript. And on the other hand, most people believe that new papers from a fresh PhD having affinity with the ideas from the PhD advisor is to be expected and trivial. Also, that having a coffee and saying ""something could be done"" without being specific or showing no plans to do it is miles away from building a full study on that matter.

This conflict seemed to scale down when I said I would acknowledge that many of these ideas were developed during my PhD in the acknowledgement sections through discussions with him. I have no problem on that, I was transparent through the whole process. But due to health issues I haven't been able to finish the final proof in a week. What surprised me the most is that I assume he got anxious about the lack of updates (he is aware of my current state and decided to ignore it) and he wrote the editor explaining the problem and asking for an acknowledgement change. I immediately answered the editor saying that I was of course willing to change the acknowledgements, and the editor said this would solve the problem. He is my former PhD advisor, I never intended to take credit away from his influence on my development, it is obvious he was influential. The first thing I did in my new university (first postdoc) was having him invited, he knows that.

I am confused by all of this, and seriously concerned about my new postdoc, which of course has thematic affinity with my PhD, and whether he will claim every time I used his ideas on anything new that I make. I am also concerned about what he said to the editorial board and what the editorial board thinks. This situation, which I absolutely tried to prevent by being transparent during the whole manuscript evolution (from conception to publication), is making me very stressed. Also, I feel like every time I discuss this with some colleague I significantly stain the public perception of my former PhD advisor, and that conflicts with my need to vent.

I am not sure how to act in this kind of conflicts, and would appreciate hearing the experience from people that took their first step towards independence, potentially smoother than I did.",3,1766309160.0,AskAcademia,7,1.0,False

I am pretty lost about my throat condition and I don’t know what to do, what it is, and how am I supposed to fix it. It would immensely help if u could help me or advise me... It’s going to be quite long so sorry ahead...

  
It all started around 3 or 4 years ago. I used to be a smoker since my 19. At the time and still now actually, I was dealing with some anxiety and health issue, smoking was stupid ( only smoking tabacco to be precise ) but it was one of the way for me to calm down instantly when I d have a high stress moment. Even though I fought against it to find a way to stop , struggling multiple times. I was not a huge smoker , like around 7 to 12 a day I'd say with multiple times smoking ""only"" 3 or 4 or not smoking at all.  Then one day I felt like my throat was sore and I had some ball around my adam’s apple. I stopped smoking immediately and the feeling disappeared instantly 2 or 3 days after. Fast forward to 2 or 3 months, I started smoking again and a month after the feeling came back. Once again I stopped smoking and it disappeared in a week. Fast forward again to 3 or 4 months and we arrive at around 2 years ago. I started AGAIN , and the feeling came back instantly and as stroong as before. I smoked throught it ( so freaking stupid ) and dealt with this for months then I tried to stop once again in November last year but it didn’t do any difference.

By that time I had another bunch of symptoms, pretty strong ones for someone smoking ""only"" that amount, here they are : I was coughing so much. Especially in the morning. It was not a cough coming from my lungs and high in mucus, but a cough to clear my throat. I also couldn’t move my head left or right without feeling pressure on my throat and so coughing or struggling to maintain the position for more than 30 seconds ( sleeping on the side was a no-no). If something was to touch my frontneck , even slightly, I d feel like choking and someone strangling me. I had to give up wearing necklace, rested headphones on the shoulder, not large sweatshirts. Then I also started to have random chest pains left or right that would come and go for a few seconds/minutes. One more was struggling with my voice , it would crackle if I spoke for too long or when I tried to whisper. Finally, I felt like my swallowing mechanism was not smooth anymore , only like water or saliva was not making a sound, but if I ate something solid I d hear the sound of me swallowing it and sometimes it would be made in two times, like literrally hearing the mecanism down my throat activating to make it pass. I want to add that I never felt stomach pain or acid down my throat, burns.

Being like I m fucked anyway both in anxiety and health, persuated I d die , I smoked again but like 5 a day up until May of this year. Then a beacon of hope appeared in my life and I felt like life had a purpose for me. It was small but I had a plan for the future , something positive, and so finally gathered the courage to stop and I haven’t smoke a cigarette since the 31th of May of this year.

 I didn’t see ANY differencies at first, then yes , but in bad things. I was coughing brown/black mucus for a month or two and got a ton shit of infections or colds in the next 2 to 3 months. Back then after stopping smoking, if Id do sports I would feel like my lungs function were back in a week, here even 3 months after I felt like sports was so hard, I was sweating more than ever and catching my breath all the time. I had my first lung infection in July and my throat got so bad then it was like trying to live with a constant 6/7 discomfort.

Then I told myself I needed to get this checked out and went to my doctor. She tried to find nodes on my neck or in my mouth but found nothing. We tried some medecine for the throat but it would only help when it was irritated sometimes, not for the discomfort and like ball thing feeling. She told me to do an echo of my thyroid and all neck , which I was persuated they’d find a cancer, but I got lucky and it came back negative. Then I went to an ENT to do a laryngoscopia and he told me my throat and vocal cords were good, didn’t give me any advise thought.

Think it was over ? No we're going in the worst part. But first some hope. I started around end of september / early october to feel better on a few things. Especially when looking right or left Id feel less pressure, still here but at least I could sleep on the side. Then I d cough less, way less. Only 3 to 4 times a day. I also had a few times where this ball would almost disappear before coming back in the evening.

Then one day I had to go on a buisness trip for work and two days prior to that felt like I had muscle pains starting, then the night before we left I couldn’t sleep , like insomnia at it’s peak with a mix of discomfort in the body, anxiety and so on. When we came back from the buisness trip I immediately started to have a fever and felt cold af , went to bed and tried to sleep throught it and the day after I felt good. Then the night after I woke up with chest burning and it wouldn’t go away, I could still walk and talk but it was impossible to sleep ( like a 6 or 7/10 pain). I went to ER and was diagnosed with viral myocarditis.. At least that’s what they think. My troponine ( heart inflammation marker) went 100 times above the limit and I had to stay in hospital for 2 days. We did an echo and a MRI that luckily showed no inflammation or fibrosis and I was told to go back home with bisoprolol 1.25 mg 2 times a day. No sports or alcohol for at least 3 months. The first week I felt like shit. I went back to work but from home and anxiety of it coming back went throught the roof. I was exhausted climbing a few stairs and wouldn’t go out for a walk. My pace was like divided by 2 . But my throat pain didn’t left me and kept me good company also ;). My wisedom teeth started to grow for some reason and now my mouth felt like brikstones being crushed at times too.

After a few weeks I went to pay a visit to a friend and I had maybe the worst time of my life. One day I felt like my throat had tripled in size , I couldn’t move my head left or right again, eating or talking was impossible, high high discomfort like 8/10 and my wisedom teeth hurt so bad I felt like someone was crushing my teeth between it’s hands. It was like I had a fever dream, they were all enjoying their evening and I was fighting for my life on the chair just to stay in the moment. I tried to force a cough and almost puke nothing worked. Then it went away... for a week. Boom agaiin at some friends , felt like my neck doubled in size and when I ate I felt like the food was stuck in my throat. I had to rest on their couch and I took a gaviscon that slightly helped but still. It’s like I couldn’t be 100% in the moment , always focused on how my throat is functionning. I talked to my cardiologist , suggesting maybe it was from the medecine , and she told me I could try to stop it but wasn’t convinced it was because of that ( I also started to have problem catching my breath and waking up at night sweating which were related to the medecine ). I booked an appointment with my dentist and got 2 of the 3 wisedom teeth removed. And last but not least got another ENT appointment. Since I was so afraid to eat I simply didn’t and lost like 5 kgs in 4 days. The other ENT told me the same thing as back then and tried to make me swallow a cookie , I did and she say she saw nothing wrong with my swallowing function. It was November the 26th. I told myself I was cursed, like the only time I try to fix my shit , life is making me pay 10 times. Then I said well, time to try a diet anyway, let’s see if I can fix it with what I eat. I stopped cheese , coffee, tea, soda, acid food , only eating bland food with no spice, lost a couple more kgs ( around 7 total now ) and I also tried PPI  as the ENT suggested.

To be honest I feel 0 difference. I have some days where I feel like my throat symptoms are here at 3/4 , sometimes I m lucky I don't feel them for 2 or 3 hours and FORGOT about it since Im focused on another fear, sometimes it’s around a 5. I told myself , hey it takes times for it to come and work so be patient , but I m about to it the 4 weeks mark and I don’t see ANY difference. Diet did nothing, IPP did nothing. I had another crisis 15 days ago but I took paracetamol and gaviscon and it vanished. Gaviscon is actually the only thing slightly working. It doesn’t make the discomfort disappear but helps reduce the pain when I feel like my neck double in size. 

I told myself it was all from my wisedom teeth from the bottom because I was told it was a bit infected and inflammed , but removed it 10 days ago and nothing changed. I'm doing yoyo between a 1/2 and 4 discomfort all day long , scared of the new crisis. Lastly I checked my lungs Monday with a scan and once again thank god, it came back negative for anything.",1,1766308964.0,LPRSilentGerd,2,1.0,False

I like the colours, which happens to be the colours I naturally gravitates towards. I believe they look good on me.

The problem is lipsticks. Every recommendation for soft autumns seems either too dark, too light too warm, or too ""meh"". 

So I wonder, what lipsticks do you use out there?

Here are the ones I have tried:

  
Mac Chili: Veeery dark on me. 

Mac Velvet teddy: My everyday lipstick. Looks good but very neutral. Almost like no lipstick on me.

Mac creme in your coffee: Nice but tend to be on the darker side. If I use it lightly it could be used as a everyday lipstick. 

Bobbi Brown crushed: Italian Rose: Nice but could look a tad too warm at winter when I am at my palest. Better as a summer lipstick. 

Mac Mehr: Not terrible but look a tad too cool. Makes me look pale. 

Mac Twig: Oh what a wonderful memory. I have been looking for its replacement ever since it discontinued.

From the rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence in Sydney’s financial districts to the burgeoning biotech scenes in Melbourne, the landscape is shifting. For professionals and recent graduates alike, navigating this terrain can feel like trying to solve a puzzle where the pieces are constantly changing shape. While technical certifications and university degrees provide the foundation, there is a secret ingredient that often separates those who struggle from those who land high-paying roles: the presence of a seasoned Tech Career mentor.



In a market where ""who you know"" is often as important as ""what you know,"" finding a guide who has already traversed the path you are on is invaluable. This article explores the secrets to connecting with the best mentors and why professional guidance is the most effective tool in your career arsenal.



The True Value of Professional Guidance in Tech

Mentorship is more than just a series of casual coffee chats; it is a strategic partnership designed to accelerate your professional maturity. When you engage with a personal career mentor, you aren't just getting advice—you are gaining a shortcut to years of trial and error.



The tech industry is notorious for its ""hidden job market."" In Australia, many of the most lucrative positions are filled through internal referrals or professional networks before they are ever listed on public platforms. A mentor for career development provides you with a bridge into these exclusive circles. They offer insights into company culture, help you decode complex job descriptions, and provide the technical validation that gives recruiters confidence.



Furthermore, the benefits of having a career mentor include a significant boost in professional confidence. For many, ""imposter syndrome"" is a major barrier to applying for senior-level roles. Having a tech mentor to validate your skills and challenge your weaknesses allows you to walk into interviews with a clear sense of your own value.



Key Advantages of Mentorship:

Targeted Skill Acquisition: A mentor helps you identify which tools are actually used in the industry, preventing you from wasting time on outdated frameworks.



Strategic Goal Setting: Moving from a generalist to a specialist requires a plan. A mentor helps you map out the next three to five years of your career.



Negotiation Support: Knowing the salary benchmarks for your city—whether you are looking for a career mentor sydney or a career mentor brisbane—ensures you don't leave money on the table.



If you are an Australian student or professional looking to transform your career, it is essential to look for platforms that specialize in these connections. Emergi Mentors is an Australian digital platform designed to connect students and professionals with seasoned global mentors in fields like AI, data science, and tech careers. The platform offers tailored 1:1 mentorship to help individuals navigate the Australian job market, particularly in competitive sectors. This specific focus on the local landscape makes it a powerful resource for those aiming for the top tier of the industry.



Regional Nuances: Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane

Australia’s tech hubs are not identical. Each city has its own pulse and preferred technologies. To make the most of your career, you should seek guidance that is geographically relevant.



For example, a career mentor sydney will likely have deep ties to the banking and fintech sectors. They understand the rigorous compliance and high-performance requirements of firms operating in the CBD. Conversely, a career mentor melbourne might focus more on the creative tech scene, startup ecosystems, and the growing ed-tech industry that thrives in Victoria.



Even in Queensland, the demand for a career mentor brisbane is rising as the city prepares for major infrastructure projects and a surge in government-led tech initiatives. By working with career mentors Australia-wide, you ensure that your career strategy is aligned with the specific economic drivers of your region.



The benefits of a career mentor are most apparent when they can say, ""In this specific city, Company X values this specific trait."" This level of granular detail is something you cannot find in a generic online tutorial.



Specializing in the Future: The AI Revolution

Perhaps no field is as competitive right now as Artificial Intelligence. Every major corporation is looking for an ai specialist to help them stay ahead of the curve. However, the path to becoming one is often unclear. Is it enough to know Python? Do you need a PhD?



This is where an ai specialist career mentor becomes essential. They can help you understand the difference between being a user of AI tools and being someone who can architect AI solutions. Landing a high-paying ai specialist job requires a portfolio that demonstrates real-world problem-solving, not just academic exercises.



If you are looking to build a sustainable ai specialist career, you need to understand the nuances of the Australian market's data privacy laws and ethical frameworks. A career mentor ai specialist can provide the necessary context to ensure your work is both innovative and compliant.



For those who are ready to seek careen in ai specialist roles (to use the industry term for rapid career movement), the guidance of a senior professional can cut your learning curve in half. (Note: Many students find that having a roadmap for their ai specialist career allows them to focus on high-impact projects that catch the eye of top-tier employers).



To truly understand how this works, consider the following link for a detailed roadmap: seek career in ai specialist. This resource helps clarify the steps needed to transition into this high-growth field effectively.



Case Study: Sarah’s Transition to AI Leadership

To illustrate the real-world impact of finding the right tech mentor, let’s look at a case study based on a typical journey through the Emergi Mentors ecosystem.



The Candidate: Sarah, a Senior Data Analyst in Sydney with seven years of experience. The Goal: Transition into a dedicated ai specialist role with a focus on machine learning operations (MLOps). The Problem: Despite her experience, Sarah’s applications for an ai specialist job were being rejected because she lacked specific ""end-to-end deployment"" experience.



The Mentorship Journey: Sarah connected with a career mentor sydney through a specialized platform. Her mentor was a Lead Data Scientist at a major Australian airline.



Gap Analysis: The mentor identified that Sarah’s technical skills were strong, but her resume didn't speak the language of ""business value.""



Portfolio Pivot: Instead of general projects, they worked on a case study involving predictive maintenance for industrial equipment—a high-value area in the Australian market.



Career Mentor Consulting: They held mock interviews specifically focused on the ""behavioral technical"" questions common in Australian senior roles.



Network Access: Her mentor introduced her to a peer looking for a specialized ai specialist career mentor to join their new innovation lab.



The Outcome: Within four months, Sarah secured a role as an AI Lead. Not only did she achieve her career pivot, but she also negotiated a 30% salary increase. Her mentor provided the ""insider knowledge"" that allowed her to position herself as an expert rather than a learner. This highlights the benefits of having a career mentor who understands the local landscape.



How Mentorship Helps You Land High-Paying Jobs

Many people assume that hard work alone leads to high salaries. In reality, it is a combination of hard work, visibility, and strategy. Here is how career tech mentors Australia help you secure those elite positions:



1. Career Guidance and Goal Setting

A mentor helps you set clear, achievable career goals. They provide insights into the Australian job market, helping you identify high-paying industries and roles that align with your skills and interests.



2. Building Essential Skills

Mentors help you identify and develop the skills that employers value most. From technical expertise to soft skills like communication and leadership, they can guide you on how to be job-ready for competitive roles. This is particularly important for those in mentor tech relationships where the technology changes monthly.



3. Networking Opportunities

Mentors often have established professional networks. They can connect you with influential people in your industry, increasing your chances of accessing unadvertised roles or exclusive opportunities.



4. Boosting Confidence

Having a mentor to guide you through challenges and decisions can significantly boost your confidence. This can make a big difference in interviews, performance reviews, and negotiations for higher salaries.



5. Learning from Their Experience

A mentor’s personal career experiences and insights can help you avoid common mistakes and fast-track your progression. Their tried-and-tested strategies can be a blueprint for your own success.



6. Access to Hidden Job Markets

Many high-paying positions in Australia are filled through referrals and internal recommendations. Your mentor can help you tap into these networks and get access to opportunities that are not openly advertised.



Actionable Tips for Leveraging Mentorship

If you are ready to find a career tech mentor, you must be proactive. Here are several actionable tips to ensure your mentorship is successful:



Be Proactive: Take the initiative to reach out to potential mentors within your network or industry. Clearly communicate your goals and explain why you seek their guidance.



Set Clear Expectations: Work with your mentor to establish a structure for your relationship. Decide how often you’ll meet, what you’ll discuss, and what outcomes you're aiming for.



Be Open to Feedback: Accept constructive criticism with an open mind. Use it to improve and grow in your career.



Think Long-Term: Perspective is everything. Understand that mentorship is not about quick fixes but about sustainable career development that prepares you for long-term success.



Apply What You Learn: Don’t just seek advice—implement it. Follow through with the tips and strategies your mentor shares with you to achieve tangible results.



When you engage in career mentor consulting, you are treating your career like a business. This professionalized approach ensures that you are always moving toward the most lucrative and fulfilling roles available.



Why Choose Professional Career Mentors in Australia?

The Australian tech scene is small enough that reputation matters immensely, but large enough that you can get lost without a map. Whether you are looking for career mentors in Australia or more specifically a career tech mentors Australia expert, the focus should always be on quality over quantity.



Using a personal career mentor allows you to navigate the specific cultural nuances of the Australian workplace—such as the ""tall poppy syndrome"" and the importance of a ""fair go."" A mentor who has succeeded here knows how to help you stand out without being overbearing.



Furthermore, for those interested in mentor tech or specialized fields, the guidance of a career tech mentor ensures that your technical trajectory is sound. You won't just learn how to code; you'll learn how to build systems that scale within the constraints of Australian enterprise environments.



Conclusion: Your Future Starts with a Connection

Mentorship truly is a game changer. With the right guidance and a proactive approach, you can unlock incredible opportunities in Australia’s job market! The transition from a junior role to a senior ai specialist or a tech lead is rarely done in isolation. It requires the insight, support, and network of someone who has been there before.



If you're an Australian student or professional looking to transform your career, consider joining a dedicated community. Platforms like Emergi Mentors connect you with experienced mentors across multiple fields who can help you achieve your goals, gain industry insights, and secure high-paying jobs.

Chapter 1
I stared at the white plastic stick in my trembling hand, the two pink lines unmistakable. My heart thundered in my chest as I grabbed the second test from the counter, finding the same result. Pregnant. I was pregnant.
Tears sprang to my eyes as I pressed a hand to my still-flat stomach. A baby. Our baby. After three years of marriage, Ryan and I were finally going to be parents.
""Oh my God,"" I whispered, my voice echoing in our marble bathroom. The morning light streamed through the frosted windows, casting everything in a dreamlike glow. This moment—this perfect, beautiful moment—deserved to be shared.
I grabbed my phone from the counter, my fingers fumbling as I pulled up Ryan's contact. He had left early for work, kissing my forehead while I was still half-asleep. Now I understood why I'd been feeling so tired lately, why certain smells in our penthouse had suddenly become overwhelming.
The phone rang three times before he answered.
""Claire,"" Ryan's voice came through, clipped and professional. ""I'm in the middle of a board meeting. Can this wait?""
I hesitated, my excitement faltering. In the background, I could hear what sounded like clinking dishes, not the usual murmur of voices that accompanied his meetings.
""It's important,"" I said, trying to keep the hurt from my voice. ""I have something to tell you.""
""I really can't talk right now,"" he insisted, his tone growing impatient. ""I'll call you back in an hour.""
Before I could respond, the line went dead. I lowered the phone slowly, staring at the darkened screen. The joy that had been bubbling inside me moments ago now felt hollow.
A board meeting? Something didn't feel right. Ryan's investment firm rarely scheduled meetings before ten, and it was barely eight-thirty. The background noises I'd heard weren't consistent with the conference room's usual acoustics.
A nagging feeling of unease crept up my spine. I opened our building's security app on my phone—a feature Ryan had insisted on for ""peace of mind"" when we'd moved in. I rarely used it, feeling it was an invasion of privacy, but something compelled me now.
I navigated to the live feed of our apartment, selecting the hallway camera that partially captured our kitchen entrance. Ryan had never set foot in our kitchen in the three years we'd lived here—not once. His mother had taken her life there when he was sixteen, and the trauma had left him with what he called a ""debilitating phobia."" Even when I'd been desperately ill with pneumonia last winter, begging him to just heat some soup, he'd refused, flying into a rage at the mere suggestion.
""I can't, Claire! You know I can't!"" he had shouted, his face contorted with what I'd believed was genuine anguish. ""Don't ask me to do that!""
I'd dragged myself to the kitchen instead, feverish and weak, making my own soup while he watched television in the living room.
The security feed loaded, and my heart stopped.
There was Ryan, moving confidently around our kitchen. He chopped vegetables with practiced ease, stirring a pot on the stove before tasting its contents with a spoon. His movements weren't those of someone facing their deepest fear—they were fluid, comfortable, routine.
As I watched, frozen in disbelief, he ladled the steaming soup into a bowl, garnished it with fresh herbs, and carried it with a proud smile to someone seated just out of the camera's view.
The angle shifted slightly as he moved, and I caught a glimpse of sleek blonde hair. Madison Taylor. His executive assistant.
The pregnancy test slipped from my fingers, clattering to the tile floor as the truth crashed over me. The trauma, the phobia, the years of me tiptoeing around his supposed trigger—it had all been a lie. A cruel, calculated lie.
The man who had refused to make his desperately ill wife a simple bowl of soup was now cooking with joy and tenderness for another woman in the very space he claimed caused him unbearable psychological pain.
I pressed my hand to my mouth, stifling a sob as the full weight of the betrayal crushed my chest. This wasn't just an affair. This was the systematic dismantling of everything I believed about our marriage, about the man I had devoted my life to.
As I watched him gently tuck a napkin under Madison's chin, the two pink lines on the test at my feet took on a new, terrifying significance. I wasn't just pregnant.
I was pregnant with the child of a stranger.

Chapter 2
The white paper crackles as I grip it tighter, the edges biting into my palm. I stand frozen in the doorway of our living room, watching as Ryan pours himself a whiskey from the bar cart. His eyes meet mine in the mirror behind it, a flicker of something—guilt? irritation?—crossing his features before he turns back to his drink.
""Ryan,"" I say, my voice barely above a whisper. ""We need to talk.""
He swirls the amber liquid, the ice clinking against the crystal. ""What is it, Claire? I've had a long day."" His tone is dismissive, like a parent to a whiny child.
I cross the room, the divorce papers trembling in my hands. ""I found out today,"" I say, my voice steadier now. ""About the kitchen. About Madison.""
He sets the glass down with a click, his shoulders stiffening. ""You're being dramatic again.""
The words sting, but I push on. ""I saw the footage. You were cooking for her. After everything you told me—""
""Jesus Christ."" He spins to face me, his eyes flashing with anger. ""That was a one-time thing. She was sick, and I felt sorry for her. You're blowing this out of proportion.""
My hands clench into fists, the papers crumpling further. ""A one-time thing? You've been lying to me for years. Using your mother's death as an excuse—""
""Don't you dare bring my mother into this,"" he growls, taking a step toward me. ""You have no idea what it was like for me.""
I flinch, but hold my ground. ""All I know is that the man I married was a liar. And I won't stay in a marriage based on lies.""
His expression shifts, a cold smirk twisting his lips. ""You think you can just leave me? Who else would take you, Claire? You're pregnant, for God's sake. No one else would want damaged goods like you.""
The words hit like a physical blow, knocking the breath from me. I stagger back, the room spinning. ""You... you're the damaged one,"" I manage to gasp. ""Not me.""
His laugh is cruel, cutting. ""You're really going to play it that way? Fine. Go ahead, file your little papers. See how far it gets you.""
He snatches the documents from my hand, ripping them in half with a flourish. The sound of tearing paper echoes in the silent room.
I stand there, frozen, as he tosses the shredded remnants at my feet. ""You'll be back,"" he says, his voice dripping with venom. ""Mark my words.""
***
The next morning, I sit in the sleek, high-rise office of Chen & Associates, clutching a cup of lukewarm coffee. Across from me, Daniel Chen—my childhood friend, and one of Manhattan's top divorce attorneys—studies the security footage on his laptop.
His expression darkens as he watches Ryan stir the pot, Madison's laughter carrying through the audio. ""Son of a bitch,"" he mutters, slamming the laptop shut.
""I'm sorry, Claire."" His eyes lock onto mine, filled with a mixture of anger and compassion. ""You didn't deserve this.""
I shake my head, tears pricking at the corners of my eyes. ""I don't care about me. I care about the baby. I won't let Ryan near my child after... after this.""
Daniel's jaw tightens. ""You won't have to. I'll make sure of it.""
He leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers together. ""We need to move fast. Freeze the joint accounts before he can siphon off more funds. I'll file an emergency motion with the court.""
I nod, numbness spreading through my limbs. ""Whatever you think is best.""
His gaze softens. ""Claire, I know this isn't easy. But I promise you, we'll get through this. Together.""
***
Two hours later, Daniel stands outside the imposing glass doors of First Manhattan Bank, a stack of court papers clutched in his hand. He adjusts his suit jacket, his expression hardening as he pushes through the revolving doors.
The lobby is bustling with activity, but Daniel's focus is singular. He strides past the reception desk, flashing his ID at the security guards. ""I need to see the branch manager. Immediately.""
The guard nods, radioing ahead. Within minutes, a harried-looking man in a pinstripe suit hurries toward them.
""Mr. Chen,"" he says, extending a sweaty hand. ""What can I do for you?""
Daniel doesn't smile. ""I'm here to execute a court order freezing all joint accounts belonging to Ryan and Claire Morgan. Effective immediately.""
The manager blanches. ""I... I need to verify the paperwork.""
Daniel thrusts the documents into his hands. ""You'll find everything in order. I suggest you move quickly. The courts take a dim view of delays in these matters.""
The manager nods curtly, already scrolling through the pages on his phone. ""Yes, sir. It's done. The accounts are frozen as of now.""
Daniel's expression doesn't change, but a flicker of satisfaction crosses his eyes. ""Good. I trust you'll inform Mr. Morgan of this development promptly.""
The manager nods again, disappearing into the bowels of the bank. Daniel watches him go, his jaw clenched.
""Let the games begin,"" he mutters, turning on his heel.

Chapter 3
I had barely settled into the temporary SoHo apartment Daniel had secured for me when the aggressive pounding on my door began. Through the peephole, I saw Rebecca's distorted face, her expression twisted with fury. My hand instinctively moved to my stomach—a protective gesture that had become second nature since discovering my pregnancy.
""I know you're in there, Claire!"" she shouted, her voice echoing through the hallway.
With a deep breath, I unlocked the door, opening it just enough to face her but not enough to invite her in. ""Rebecca. This isn't a good time.""
She pushed past me anyway, her designer heels clicking aggressively against the hardwood floors. The scent of her overpowering perfume made my stomach turn—another reminder of my changing body.
""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" she demanded, whirling to face me. ""Divorce? Are you insane? Do you have any idea what this is doing to Ryan?""
I closed the door quietly, a strange calm settling over me. Just days ago, her fury would have intimidated me into submission. Now, it merely highlighted how trapped I'd been.
""What this is doing to Ryan,"" I repeated, my voice steady. ""That's interesting, considering what Ryan has been doing to me for years.""
""Oh, spare me the victim act,"" she spat. ""So he cooked for his assistant. Big deal. She was sick.""
""I was sick too, Rebecca,"" I said quietly. ""Pneumonia. I could barely stand. And your brother—my husband—refused to even heat soup for me because of his supposed trauma.""
Something flickered across her face—doubt, perhaps—but it vanished quickly. ""You're destroying our family over nothing.""
""Your family was built on lies,"" I replied, moving toward the door. ""Now, please leave.""
She didn't budge. ""You think that lawyer friend of yours actually cares about you? Please. He's just using you to get to Ryan's money.""
The accusation was so absurd I almost laughed. ""Daniel has been my friend since we were children. And unlike your brother, he's never lied to me.""
""You're making a mistake,"" she warned, her voice dropping to a threatening whisper. ""Ryan will destroy you.""
I opened the door wide. ""He already tried. And failed. Goodbye, Rebecca.""
After she stormed out, I leaned against the closed door, my heart racing but my resolve stronger than ever.
---
The next morning, I sat beside Daniel in his office, the Manhattan skyline stretching beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows. Across from us was my father, Arthur Vance, his expression grave as he reviewed the security footage on Daniel's tablet.
""That son of a bitch,"" he muttered, setting down the device. His eyes, so like my own, were dark with fury. ""All this time...""
""I need to protect myself and my baby,"" I said, my voice breaking slightly on the last word. I hadn't told my father about the pregnancy yet, and his eyes widened in shock.
""Claire,"" he breathed, reaching across the table to take my hand. ""Why didn't you tell me?""
""I just found out,"" I admitted. ""The same day I discovered...everything else.""
My father's jaw clenched, the muscle twitching in a way that reminded me painfully of Ryan. But unlike my husband's calculated rage, my father's anger stemmed from genuine love.
""Daniel,"" he said, not taking his eyes off me, ""I want to withdraw every cent of Vance capital from Morgan Investments. Immediately.""
Daniel nodded, sliding a folder across the polished table. ""I've prepared the paperwork. It will effectively remove thirty percent of their operating capital.""
My father signed without hesitation. ""He'll feel this by tomorrow morning,"" he said grimly. ""No one hurts my daughter and gets away with it.""
As I watched him sign, I remembered how proudly I'd introduced Ryan to my father years ago. How I'd convinced my father to invest in Ryan's fledgling firm. The irony wasn't lost on me—I had built the foundation of Ryan's success, and now I was witnessing its dismantling.
---
That night, alone in my temporary apartment, a memory surfaced—one I'd buried long ago. Sophomore year at Columbia. Valentine's Day. I'd received roses with no card, only to discover later they weren't from Ryan. The same day, I found a gift receipt in my textbook for earrings I never received.
I'd confronted Ryan, who'd seemed genuinely confused. Later that night, he didn't come home until dawn. When questioned, he'd claimed he needed space to ""process"" my accusations.
Now, the pieces clicked into place. Madison had been there even then, planting seeds of doubt, creating rifts she could slip through. I remembered seeing her the next day, consoling Ryan in the campus coffee shop, her hand on his arm, her expression one of perfect sympathy.
The realization made me shiver. This wasn't just about Ryan's betrayal. Madison had been orchestrating this for years, patiently waiting for the moment when she could take my place.
My phone buzzed with a text from Daniel: ""Ryan's trying to access the joint accounts. All blocked per court order.""
I stared at the message, imagining Ryan's rage when he discovered he couldn't touch our money. The thought should have frightened me. Instead, I felt a strange satisfaction.
The game had changed. And for the first time, I wasn't the only one who knew the rules had shifted.

If I stay home I try to build healthy habits: work for an hour, go outside for a few minutes, take a walk, have a morning routine, etc, but I gradually always backslide into the same: not getting out of my pj's, rolling out of bed last minute, taking naps, eating at the fridge, etc. I pay for an app called stay focused that literally blocks my phone so I can't look at anything but then I just online shop on my computer or go to the kitchen/tv/bed. The problem is just that there are too many distractions in the home and I want to be in my pjs and just relax. I know this is a matter of self-discipline and I clearly have room to grow there.

I've been on methylphenidate for 6 months, when I initially started he medication my appetite was reduced for about a month and then I felt like it went back to normal. Since then I have  felt like the medication gave me better control over my eating habits, like I was able to eat healthier and have control over craving or dopamine seeking behaviours like eating sweets, drinking coffee all the time, and having take out. However, over the last few weeks I have felt famished, appetite increase feels so much more than I have experience in the past ever. Also, I dont know if anyone else has found this but if I skip meds I'm ravenous and will eat until I feel so full I feel sick. I’ve never been a binge eater but it feels a little like that. Like have so much food noise even when im not hunger, again not normal for me. I have always been someone who kinda forgets about food then grabs the quickest and easiest thing to me.

The one sidedness prompted my Dr to send me an MRI referral and autoimmune blood panel (my mom has MS). Everything came back good fortunately.

Fast forward - I find out in 2024 that I have POTS. I'm 31. I've had it since I was 12 and spent my entire life wondering wtf was wrong with me. It has been very disabling. I am now also being tested for hEDS for reasons.

I'm realizing how many things I experience visually have been due to dysautonomia - for example, I get visual snow a lot. Well, did. Before POTS meds, I had it ALL the time. It got very bad during my Tilt Table Test, and then I realized it was fucking constant presyncope and lack of blood flow to the brain the entire time.

Now things are better but occasionally when I am flaring up in mysterious sneaky ways, I will see flashing or strobing vision in my peripherals. One time at night, my entire field of vision was all just arriving and I had to just stop looking at my phone and go to bed. Also, sometimes if I need to eat or something else that I've not pinned down, when I BLINK I will see a big black scotoma that goes away gently and quickly as my eyes reopen. Also, since very young childhood, and still to this day, if I look up at the ceiling and blink in the full darkness in bed, I will see a white ish/gray/black/idk diamond ish shape in the center of my visual field and it shows up after I blink, as my eyes reopen, and then dissipates.

I've mentioned some of this to Drs in the past and they blew me off aggressively and/or said it seemed like a neurological issue ... 🤷🏼

Anyways, I have much better medical care now and usually it's much less of a problem these days, but lately has been dropping back up again. I know it seems evident to happen with POTS due to the autonomic dysfunction and blood flow issues, I do find that laying down and eating and getting a big glass of electrolyte water can help, and in the past, pre diagnosis, if I went out in the heat and walked to get groceries and came back, I'd come inside and my vision would be INSANELY strobing in time to my heart rate, esp while walking, and my head would be pounding! It's actually nuts to think about bc this doesn't happen to me anymore! But the Drs in the past gaslighted me for so long. It was horrible.

I'm wondering if there's also a tie in with the possible EDS component....

I know this is a lot and could probably also be answered in the Pots and eds subreddits but I wanted to try here too if anyone was familiar with or also has these conditions and has a good way of explaning it.

OH also Jesus Christ when I drive, which I almost never do lol, if I don't have sunglasses on even under cloudy circumstances, I will see weird POTS induced like heart rate pulsing vision when I'm looking off in the distance esp if it's bright. Was stuck in traffic without sunnies in Texas once years ago driving my partner and I somewhere and I was trying to keep cool while it was happening but I had to keep moving my eyes around to get it to stop, but the relief was only for a few seconds. It has happened as a passenger too but only when overheated and exhausted like on a long road trip 

Anyways the more common strobey stuff etc I'm wondering if that's literally migraines but bc they aren't as dramatic as the white lightning zig zag blinders, I just never realized it? They often do seem to hit intermittently episodically ",1,1766307356.0,OcularMigraines,0,1.0,False

• I exist somewhere between structure and chaos. I build systems, test limits, and redesign what doesn’t survive.

• My work trained me to adapt, sometimes creator, sometimes breaker, sometimes the one asking the uncomfortable “what if?”

• I’m drawn to depth: thoughts beneath thoughts, patterns behind behavior.

• A perfectionist, selectively obsessive, especially when a small tweak changes the entire outcome.

• Once immersed in music. bands, multiple instruments now a quiet part of the past that still shapes my rhythm.

• I cook when thinking alone isn’t enough. Experiments welcome.

• Chess collapses my sense of time. Minutes become hours.

• Basketball, bowling, billiards and games where focus decides the winner.

• I prefer single-player stories. Too many voices ruin the signal.

• Whiskey sharpens me. Coffee does the opposite.

• I use humor to stabilize heavy moments. It’s how I keep things human.

• I don’t play emotional games. I’m here for something long-term.

• Around 5'3–5'4, moreno.

I’m into drinking coffee, books, vintage shopping, good food, nature, art but I like to try new activities as well I just don’t like drinking and partying. I realise the more I describe myself I sound 80 years old but I am in fact 25.",10,1766305719.0,NewcastleUponTyne,25,0.86,False

I'm still in the honeymoon phase with this watch but I'm loving it so far, I fell in love with it 6 months ago when I saw it for the first time in an ad. A week ago I finally took the plunge, now I can't take it off my wrist. If I'm honest I think it's too big for my wrist (45mm) but I genuinely couldn't care less, this watch is just too fun to wear.

You can actually talk about any and everything, I don't mind. Just be yourself I would like to get to know the real you not the mask that's put on for others. The only thing that I ask is that you please be engaged and present in our conversations.
