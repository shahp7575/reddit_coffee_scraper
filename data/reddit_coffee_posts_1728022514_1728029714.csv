I parked at a shopping centre today and quickly ran across the road to grab a coffee, then went back to the shopping centre to do my shop. The security cameras watched me exit the centre and called a tow truck company to have my car towed. I only figured this out when I went to go back to my car to get my medication out of it and it was gone. I contacted the company and they were so so so awful and intimidating, they also let me know that my car was unlocked then hung up on me. They closed at 4 today and let me know there was an after hours charge if I wanted to pick it up over the weekend this is totally understandable however he wouldn’t reply to any of my messages until after 4pm. I really really want to lock my car as all my of uni tech is in there (I absolutely know this should have been locked in the first place) but he is refusing to give the address. I can’t afford the weekend fee as I’m a full time uni student and I’m not joking when I say I have 3.40 to my name right now. I’m so lost with what to do and would really really really appreciate any advice anyone has. Thank you for taking the time to read this ♥️",1,1728029566.0,AusLegal,1,1.0,False
1fvu24b,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/arts/design/climate-london-gardens-rewild.html,"London’s Once-Tidy Green Spaces Are Going Wild, On Purpose - To he New York Times",">London’s parks and gardens have long been peaceful escapes for residents and visitors alike, but lately there’s been a revolution afoot. While the phrase “London garden” might call to mind images of carefully manicured lawns, the city’s green spaces appear to have entered their wild era.

>Take Regent’s Park, where Frieze London will be held. While its famous rose garden and elegant tree-lined walkways remain well-tended, most of its 410 acres is a mix of wildlife habitats — hedgerows, scrub, grasslands and wetlands — which have been allowed to take on a more rugged look.

>The Royal Parks, the charity that runs Regent’s Park and seven more of London’s most famous public parks, along with Brompton Cemetery and Victoria Tower Gardens, has been “rewilding” the 5,000 acres it manages, as a response to the global climate and biodiversity emergency. It’s part of a larger movement that is changing the landscape of green spaces across the British capital.

>The Tower of London, once surrounded by a barren flat lawn of a moat, now blooms with a sea of wildflowers in the summer, while the Barbican Estate, a massive residential complex next to the performing arts center of the same name, houses a wildlife garden where local residents have recorded over 300 species. Amid the glass and steel of Westminster, a small lane is now home to an organic garden.

>The term rewilding was introduced decades ago, originally describing large ecological restoration projects that often included reintroducing apex predators. More recently, the phrase has been more widely applied, describing all manner of conservation projects that can be anything from small personal wildlife gardens to mega-restoration initiatives.

>Given the broad definition, it’s hard to estimate the exact scale of rewilding happening across London, but the concept is drawing more money and attention as Britain has felt the effects of climate change, as in summer 2022, when temperatures in London hovered around 100 degrees during a severe heat wave. Since 2016, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has invested more than 28 million pounds (over $37 million) in greening the city, according to a report published last year by the London Rewilding Taskforce.

>To date, the Rewild London Fund, launched by the city in 2021 as a part of this effort, has helped pay for 41 projects that include restoration of wetlands, meadows and ancient woodlands, and conservation grazing, where cattle are being reintroduced to manage the land. The fund also helped those studying ways to create wildlife corridors to connect sites of importance in nature conservation that help native species in decline.

>“There is definitely a feeling of a sea change,” said Mathew Frith, 64, director of policy and research at the London Wildlife Trust who was a member of the London Rewilding Taskforce. “When I started working for London Wildlife Trust at the age of 29, I would have found it very difficult to predict where we are now.”

>Frith also added that people are talking about it “in a way we never really heard.”

>A survey of around 1,500 Londoners who are active on Talk London, City Hall’s online community, showed most respondents considered rewilding to be important and wanted more unmanaged spaces rewilded. Many acknowledged the mental and physical health benefits of spending time in green spaces and said spending free time in nature helped them feel more productive at work.

>While the rewilding task force noted in the 2023 report that large-scale efforts are key to impact, it added that smaller and medium-scale projects still play an important role as steppingstones for nature throughout the city, and also help to engage Londoners, making it more likely that they will support these initiatives in the decades and maybe even centuries to come.

>One such project is the Onion Garden, a pocket of green amid the steel, glass and concrete of buildings in Westminster. It’s an organic garden that’s sprouted in containers on a small paved lane sandwiched between a Taj hotel and the London headquarters of the Swire conglomerate.

>The creation of Jens Jakobsen, a Danish florist who runs his business nearby, the garden is not funded by the Rewild London Fund, but has been supported by the Greening Westminster program. Jakobsen noted that the garden has also been supported by the owners of Seaforth Place — the privately owned area where it’s located — and the government agency Transport for London, which provided part of the land.

>The 56-year-old Jakobsen, a longtime London resident, created the garden as a sanctuary away from the stresses of urban life, where people can come, sit for a while and heal. Frequented by government workers, business people and diplomats, as well as by area residents and homeless people, it’s a quirky place that encourages people to become children again. It’s a place where fallen leaves from nearby plane trees are gathered and turned into ornaments, and onions hang in the trees, their bulbs and curly stems woven into the shrubbery.

>“That, you can say, is a real eye-catcher for people,” said Jakobsen in a video call. “And a lot of people actually stopping us and saying, ‘do they really grow on trees?’”

>Jakobsen looked dressed for the part of a woodcutter in a Danish fairy tale, or perhaps Father Christmas on his day off, in a checked white and green shirt, overlaid with a brown vest, his beard and handlebar mustache curled on the edges, and thick, round tortoiseshell glasses perched on his nose.

>He walked energetically through the garden, pointing out the different fixtures and upgrades, and he was keen to spread the word about spending time in nature.

>“People need to get their finger in the soil and feel nature again,” said Jakobsen, who noted that he had personally benefited from time in the Danish wilderness after being injured in a car accident that left him, in his words, looking like the “guy from Notre Dame, ringing the bells.”

>“I went down in the ancient forest nearly every day,” he said. “Lying around underneath the trees there, rolling in the leaves, and in that way, I started to feel my body again.”

>Jakobsen is also working with the city on a program to bring older people to visit the garden.

>“We will soon start out some events here, evenings or afternoons where they can attend,” he said. “It can be everything from knitting classes to just a coffee talk so they get out of their homes.” The greenhouse currently doubles as a community space that hosts tai chi classes, and the garden has opened a cafe at the entrance.

>He is also in talks with a London hospital that wants to bring patients to spend time in the garden, so they can relax and connect with nature.

>“You can see it with people, especially office workers, they just go away so happy,” said Jakobsen.

>And while his focus is more on creating an uplifting space for the community, Jakobsen noted that the 13 by 100-foot lane is also now home to more than 220 different kinds of plants all potted in containers and recorded by volunteers who help him maintain the garden. He has also been witness to how attitudes have changed in creating wilder, less managed spaces.

>Ten years ago, he said, the horticultural society people thought, “‘You’re not really right with all this wilderness.’ But turns out I was, because now everybody wants to do it. But it’s the global warming who actually forced us to it.”

>“I want to show people you can make an effort yourself, and it doesn’t have to be in a big scale, and just plant some seeds and see what happens.”",1,1728029319.0,RewildingUK,0,1.0,False

Sorry for the many posts lately, but I’m in a dilemma. In November we go on a family weekend (my stepdad’s family side) with +-20 people, but most of them are dog haters 🥲 As I understood from your comments, Noa’s teenage phase will last for a couple of months and she will be 9 mo by then. She’s very stubborn and energetic lately, allowed in the sofa (and jumps us lol), we don’t have a coffee table anymore because she knocks everything over with her tail, she destroys things and loves nothing more than jump us when she’s been outside in the rain. I really want her to come with us because it’s in nature with walking trails and we haven’t done this, I think she would love it! Do you think it’s a good idea to bring her to the weekend? 😅 Who could be mad at this cutie pie? 😍

Fun: A few years ago my parents also brought their bmd and she was so sweet and an adult, but on the weekend we had to drag her back because she was tired of walking, and she rolled around in cow shit so the whole house smelled like it, everyone was so mad 😂",1,1728029304.0,bernesemountaindogs,0,1.0,False

# WHAT’S HAPPENING IN DERBY?

🚧 **Derby Market Hall: A Glimpse into the Future** 🛍️

Exciting new images have been released showing how the iconic Derby Market Hall will be transformed into a modern and vibrant space.

The plans reveal a brighter and more inviting atmosphere, where the historic structure will host a mix of traditional market stalls, local businesses, and artisanal food vendors. Along with the restoration of the grand Victorian roof, the design aims to breathe new life into this iconic space.

The revamped Market Hall promises to be the go-to spot for shopping, dining, and socialising, with high-quality food outlets, independent shops, and even spaces for events! 🍴🛒

Councillor Nadine Peatfield commented on the plans, saying:

""The revitalisation of Derby Market Hall is a reflection of our collective ambition to restore this historic gem. It will be a dynamic hub, promoting local businesses, and bringing people together in a refreshed, welcoming space.""

This project is part of Derby City Council’s ongoing commitment to redeveloping the city centre, supported by a £5.3 million grant from the Government’s Future High Streets Fund. So, whether you’re looking to explore local goods, grab a bite, or just admire the architecture, the future Market Hall will have something for everyone!

I received some really good and comforting comments. This in an amazing community and I just found it!
I need some advice in how to tell her that the plasma cleaner isn't working now.

My supervisor still doesn't know and she is in a workshop we are holding. I want to wait until the coffee break. Don't know if she is gonna be upset or will understand these things happen. I believe it is not my fault as I followed the user guide as it is and checked with a coworker. The problem is I'm a coward and am usually scared when I have to tell her something and this is relatively bad news.  Probably tells me to not touch it ever again or something like that, but in an unfriendly way and I end assuming the blame just to please her. I think I must be honest but the communication with this person is a torture before, during and after it.

We have been friends on and off for a couple of years now, she sometimes starts a fight with me and really make a big fuss about small things and refuses to talk( decline phone calls/ refusing to meet up to solve issues, ignoring me even if i said something kind to just reverse the situation even though im not the one mistaken, solent treatment for months/ she once ignored me at the gym like i never existed which really threw me off and i went home crying) , she’s just so hard to deal with, i always try to calm down the situation because i think that she’s very affected by her parent’s health decline and all the past issues that she hasn’t talk to a professional for yet. 
Fast forward to now, a few days ago we had a big competition and we were a team of two, alot of ppl came to cheer for us, and we were sitting in our rest times with a sweet group of ladies who treated us with the same attention and kindness and we were sharing strategies and ups and downs of the competition field and were having fun.
Later when we came out to our heat, there were a lady among the spectators,whom i saw on the gym before and F introduced me to her but something was off about her, i always feel like she doesn’t like me, she was cheering so loud for my friend F even though we are both in a team! And after we finished our heat she high-fived her, i ignored all of this, until she came later when F and i were watching other athletes competing and she was hugging her and talking to her, F said “this is D “me” i think you saw her at the gym before” she said yes with a weird expression and she didnt even proceed to greet me or anything, i was pissed because she kept talking to F , and when i told F lets do this and that she said i dont have any energy im drained and she picked a fight with me over taking photos together and making memories since this competition happens once a year and we barely got in, i was like in my head: how come you have time to chat with someone whose unimportant and shows signs of hatred towards your BF “me”? I feel like she doesn’t like us together and im very jealous over my friend F, even though F tries to introduce me to everyone she knows all the time , and she has no issues with that, im trying to calm myself down and not cause any more issues because F has been mean to me before and is fine with fighting me even though she cares sometimes for me.. 
a past fight made her unfollow me of instagram and she refused to follow me again , she has this lady whom i dont like and all other ladies in her instagram but not me.

I also noticed that there were alot of one-sided things that i did only, which hurt me , i kept hugging her, and leaning on her sometimes and joking around, she has been giving me a cold expression sometimes that in the middle of the competition i burst out crying because everything i wanted to do with her she didnt want to (coffee, pizza, etc…) and my trainer was shocked, i haven’t told anyone why i cried but F says i feel like its about me.
Im all over the place with my post, i actually havent said some details as its already a very long one, but i hate the lady from the gym who was cheering for her i feel like she’s a friend poacher…my mental health is already at the low place.
I don’t feel jealous over F from all the other ladies , the group of ladies who sat with us during our rest times i loved their company, its just some ladies that i cant really stand..
Any advice for all of that? Thank you for reading.",1,1728028752.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1fvtx4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1fvtx4g/im_at_my_wits_end_with_cystitis/,I’m at my wits end with cystitis ,"Apologies for a long post.

Im 38 years old now. I used to struggle with it as a teen, and then, miraculously, didn’t have it for 10+ years. However, last year it started occurring again. And as cystitis does, it literally started happening every month. Which is ridiculous. 

I’m living in the UK, where the procedure to get antibiotics is not quite straightforward - I have to bring my urine sample to the doctor, who checks it with the dipping strip and then sends it to a lab. 

So, every time I had cystitis, they found blood in my urine (unsurprisingly so - as past couple of times I was literally peeing with blood), but, miraculously - NO infection! I’ve been through all 10 circles of hell trying to prove I indeed have an infection (and antibiotics worked every time), I had an ultrasound and cystoscopy done - both came back clean. I tried taking d-mannose to try and make UTIs less frequent and less severe (did nothing, if anything just made them more severe) and the only thing that actually helped for a while was small dose of antibiotics to take after sex (which I unfortunately had to stop taking as they said I can develop antibiotics resistance if I keep taking them). 

So I was cystitis free for like 6-7 months and then a few weeks ago I was hit by the worst cystitis ever. Like, I’m not joking, I was legit peeing with blood all night. Yet, tests still not showed the infection! 

I’ve seen the doctor again and they prescribed me Hiprex for prevention, so I’m hoping this would help. 

But has anyone experienced this? I mean the fact that the test comes back clean and everything seems to be in order but it still keeps happening? 

Also, as a side note, I’m following all the best practices in terms of hygiene (including peeing and having shower after sex, avoiding coffee and drinking a lot of water), nothing new has happened in my life that would cause this. 

So yeah. Any thoughts and suggestions would be highly appreciated.

I’ve been browsing around for the best espresso machine for 2024, but with so many options out there, I’m a bit overwhelmed. I’m hoping the experts here can guide me in the right direction!

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* Beginner-Friendly: I’m new to making espresso at home, so a machine that’s easy to use and learn on would be great.
* Under $1000: I’d like to keep the budget below $1000, but still want something that delivers quality espresso.
* Grinder Included: I’d love a machine with a built-in grinder, so I don’t have to buy one separately.
* Reliable for Home Use: This will be for daily home use, so I’m looking for something durable and long-lasting.

2024 Models: I want the latest technology and models, so if there are new machines that came out in 2024, I’d love to hear about them.

I’ve already come across a few machines that seem promising, like the Breville Barista Express Impress, Philips Espresso Machine 5400, and the Mr. Café Barista, but I’d love to hear what you all recommend. Are there any hidden gems I should be aware of? Or should I just stick with one of the popular choices?

Also, is it worth going for a professional espresso machine for home, or should I keep it simple for now? Any advice on the best espresso machine with a grinder for 2024 would be super helpful!",1,1728027839.0,BuyItForMe,0,1.0,False

I'm a mom now, but why is there this expectation that I have to be stronger than everyone else? It’s as if the moment I gave birth, I was handed a cape and told to embrace this superhuman strength. Sure, there are moments when I have to be resilient, but I also want to cry and hug someone and be consoled that the world sucks. 

It’s only human right? Being sensitive and vulnerable. Why can’t I be both a nurturing mother and a person who feels deeply? 

It’s frustrating to navigate this pressure to always appear strong, to put on a brave face for everyone else. Maybe i can embrace my identity as a mom without sacrificing the parts of me that are soft and vulnerable. Strength comes in many forms, and sometimes, being sensitive is the bravest thing of all.

1fvthg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1fvthg3/bedroom_advice/,Bedroom advice,"For context I am 37M. 

Recently starting seeing a new woman. Very attractive etc. Anyway I'm having some issues both getting and staying hard, especially when it comes to actual penetrative sex. I feel it is probably anxiety rather than anything physical because I exercise (I'm a gym rat really) and am in good shape. 

For now we have mostly got by with oral sex, hands etc. But I obviously want to have full sex and not have to worry about this. 

The reason I think it's anxiety/psychological is because I can't think of any physical reason - and I have experienced similar before with a woman I dated for a year. I.e. I struggled at first and then I eventually overcame it (with her it was probably even more difficult as she didn't seem into oral that much), and just wanted sex...which at first I couldn't do so I was feeling the pressure even more. 

My current woman doesn't give up easily she will still make me finish, but I rarely get rock hard and if I try sex I can easily lose my wood. I'm probably losing and regaining wood multiple times in a session but she persists which is good. Think we are both very eager to please each other. 

I know not to watch porn and stuff - I've watched it in the past. At times I've even convinced myself it isn't too bad to watch it etc - but these days I'm quite disciplined I don't watch porn and I rarely masterbate. But I sometimes think this can have a negative effect too like if you aren't getting it then you don't want it - so you start a relationship and it takes time to get going.

I've never taken anything like viagra and wouldn't even know where or how to get it. I'm wondering if that might help at least to take something to get me over the initial stages. I've heard caffine can be good so I started drinking 2-3 coffee a day (often black coffee) - I normally drink tea.

Hope you enjoy:

**[Scene: A quiet diner late at night. Walter White and Mike Ehrmantraut sit across from each other at a booth, cups of coffee steaming between them. The fluorescent lights buzz softly overhead. Walter looks reflective, his eyes distant. Mike stirs his coffee slowly, observing Walter's mood.]**

**Mike:**  
*Looks like something’s gnawing at you, Walter. Spill it.*

**Walter:**  
*You ever think about what it all means, Mike?* (Pauses, then takes a sip of coffee.) *I mean, cancer—the way it just creeps in, silent, invisible. You live your life, you raise a family, try to do what's right, and then one day you’re handed a death sentence. It makes you wonder… what’s the point?*

**Mike:**  
(Sighs) *I’ve thought about it. Seen it up close. You live long enough, you see a lot of good people get swallowed up by things they didn’t deserve.* (Looks at Walter) *But you're not asking about them, are you? You're talking about you. How it fits into your grand plan.*

**Walter:**  
(Looks down, then back up) *Maybe. Maybe it's not just about me, though. It’s the idea of family—how much you’re willing to sacrifice for them. At what point does it stop being about them, and start being about just… surviving? Holding onto your pride, your purpose.*

**Mike:**  
(Chuckles dryly) *Pride’ll get you every time. Family, though... that’s the tricky part. You want to protect them, right? Make sure they’re set up. You do things you think are for their sake. But sometimes, Walt, you’re not doing it for them. You’re doing it because you don’t know how to stop. There’s a line, and it’s damn easy to cross.*

**Walter:**  
(Nods slowly) *When I got the diagnosis, it was like a switch flipped. Suddenly, everything became clear. What mattered. What didn’t. I wanted to leave something behind, to make sure my family was taken care of. But now…* (pauses) *I wonder if I’m too far gone to even know if I’m still doing it for them, or just for me.*

**Mike:**  
(Leans back in his seat, considering Walter’s words) *The way I see it, you had a choice, Walter. You always did. Cancer didn’t make you start cooking meth. You did that. Maybe you told yourself it was for them—your wife, your kids—but you crossed that line a long time ago. Now it’s about you. Your ego. Your empire.*

**Walter:**  
(Eyes narrowing slightly) *You think I don’t know that?* (Pauses, softening his tone) *It’s just… you spend your whole life playing by the rules, and in the end, what do you have to show for it? A dead-end job, a stack of medical bills, and a lifetime of regrets? I was dying, Mike. What was I supposed to do?*

**Mike:**  
*Sometimes, Walt, the hardest thing to do is nothing. To let it go. I get it—you were dealt a bad hand. But you didn’t fold, did you? You doubled down. You keep telling yourself it’s for family, but they’re the ones who’ll pay for it in the end. You think your kid’s gonna remember you as some tragic hero?* (Shakes his head) *He’ll remember the mess you left behind.*

**Walter:**  
(Quietly) *Maybe you’re right. Maybe none of it was ever really for them. But you don’t have a family anymore, do you, Mike? You don't know what it’s like to be a father, to have people depending on you. It's not that simple.*

**Mike:**  
*No, I don’t. Not anymore. But I know what it’s like to love someone enough to walk away. Sometimes the best thing you can do for the people you care about is to not drag them down with you.*

**Walter:**  
(Sighs, leaning back in his seat) *Maybe that’s the difference between you and me. You’ve made your peace with walking away. I’m not ready for that. I don’t think I ever will be.*

**Mike:**  
(Takes a sip of coffee) *And that, Walter, is why you’re gonna lose everything you’ve been fighting for.* (Pauses) *You think cancer’s your biggest problem? It’s not. It’s the lies you tell yourself.*

**Walter:**

I was 💯 not interested, but instead of shooting him down, I told him I would meet him for a coffee to discuss. I met him during the day, explained to him that I wasn't interested in him, a relationship, or even a hook up. I explained, that I was ok with being friends if that was something he wanted to explore later down the track. But that I would not be changing my mind. I ended up leaving the job, and 6/7 months later I got a call from him needing assistance for a family member and asked me to help ( it was a request in line with my role and qualifications).  He told me he was back with his partner, and invited me to a family BBQ. I attended and met his partner and thought perhaps he was being mature and had decided we could be friends. Over the next year on the odd occasion I would see him with his partner, we would watch footy or have lunch as a group, his partner and I got along very well, and things were OK. Recently he asked me to watch football with him and have some drinks there was a group of us and given his relationship status and the fact that nothing had come up I didn't think this would be a bad idea. Well during the evening he decided to shoot his shot and tried to kiss me which I managed to turn away from in time. This mother fucker was playing the long game, the old proximity breeds familiarity bla bla. Suffice to say I have cut all contact. He has been dishonest with me the entire time and had he bothered to get to know me he would know that I don't ""change my mind"" once I have said no. He has since tried to message me on all socials, rang on socials and texted off friends numbers, despite me having unfriended and ignored all attempts.

1. Mix into cold water (this is what I do with a milk frother…about 4 oz of cold water and quick pulses to keep foam down). 

2. Whisk or use a shaker bottle with warm or hot water (Don’t boil! Do you agree?)

3. Brew the powder like a tea and then strain out the plant solids (easier on the stomach?)

4. Brew rough-cut leaves like a traditional tea. I find that this produces a very mild-tasting tea like green tea with no bitterness! You do have to up your grams though I believe.

5. Add citrus to potentiate the effects

6. Take with a healthy fat like MCT oil to prolong the metabolism of the alkaloids

7. Toss and Wash

8. Oblate Papes

9. Mix with soda. Just kidding.

10. Sprinkle on cayenne pepper to reduce foam.

11. Extracts through edible food like gummies and taffy.

12. Extracts in a pouch that you place between your cheek and gums.

13. Flavored powders that you mix with water and add ice (another favorite of mine to sip on during the day).

14. Capsules (either purchased this way or made on your own)

15. Extract energy shots

16. Flavored liquid extract drops (I like coffee flavored to add into my iced latte)

17. In a honey stick…it’s delicious!

Some background. I f(37) grew up without a father. My parents got separated even before I was born, they were in their mid to late twenties then, my mom a few years younger than my father. They were married around one year, not more. We live in the South East Europe, and during the early 90ties there was a war that lasted around 4 years. My father left the country with his family (parents, brother and sister). I stayed in the country with my mom, aunt and grandmother. My father with his family moved to the US eventually, and remains living there until now (so since mid 90ties). 

He paid the child support for the first 5 years of my life, that is until the war broke out, because the court decided like that automatically during the divorce, so he had to. 

When he established the contact again with me after the war ended, it was mainly through phone and letters. I literally first met my father face to face when I was 15 years old (around 2002). And that is only beacuse he and his brother had to come to their hometown to settle some dispute over the apartments they had there. So not to mistake seeing me, his daughter, as his only reason to come back to the country. Two of them made the trip, with the cost of the ticket and everything, so it isn't like they couldn't afford the trip. 

Since mid 90ties, he was sending mainly gifts like clothes, and sometimes some money. I was in the elemetary school back then, but I remember seeing like 50$ sometimes in those envelopes. And it wasn't every month, maybe every couple of months, can't really remember. 

My father never paid for my studies, esential living cost like food, water, utilities, etc. My mom lost her job when I was in second year University. He supported me for around 2 years then, with maximum amount of 280$ per month, which amounts to around 6.000$ for those 2 years. After that I got a job and mostly supported myself. However, his condition for even receiving those 280$ per month was ""not to give anything to my mom"".  I lived with my mom and grandmother at the time. 

My public University was free, those 280$ per month were for my food and other essentials living costs. And that was the whole extent of his support during my entire life. 

I actually wanted to start working (and to continue my studies at the same time) at that time, to support myself and to help my mom and grandmother, but my father insisted that I finish the University first, well mostly beacuse he had doubts that I could finish my studies while working.  

For some perspective, he has a PhD and a high-paying job. He invested in a house, land, and apartments in two cities in our home country, though most of them sit empty since they live in the US. Despite all this, in my 37 years, he’s never mentioned the alimony he didn’t pay for me. I never actually felt as his daughter but rather as some orphan that receives donations and needs to be grateful for what little she gets. 

My father got married two more times and divorced from both of those women. He actually hid his second marriage from me, I found out because he kept some old mail addressed to his second wife, who I never even met. 
As did his older brother (got married when he was around 50 years old, and divorced when his son was only a baby). Which makes 4 failed marriages within one family. One too many to be a coincidence in any case. 

He shared 50-50 custody with his third wife and my half-sister got, as far as I know, around 1000$ per month. She started University this year, Montclair State University to be specific, and will be attending as an Out-of-State student. His third wife separated from him when my half-sister was just a baby and moved back from the US to our hometown. I actually went to visit them almost every week. I have all the pictures of me and my half-sister sister when she was a one year old baby, and I was 19 years old. And actually at that time I had a really good relationship with his third wife, and was even telling her that she should think about getting back with my father. So they get back together, she moves back to US, and after 5 or so years, they got divorced and it was a really ugly divorce, where even I got blamed by his wife. The only reason my father got 50-50 custody was because she is bipolar. As they remained to live in US, I tried to communicate with my half-sister online, but got ignored completely with messages left unanswered. So I just gave up too, eventually. Even though I didn't even try to approach her on Instagram, for some reason she blocked me there. And I honestly don't care anymore. I have my own child, husband and family and don't need such selfish, materialistic and toxic people in my life. 

When I look back now, growing up without a father, especially during those critical early years, and especially during the war years, the trauma the stress and everything else just led to my need to be close to him, and that side of family, no matter what. 
My mom is too proud and that was actually the main reason for not asking for any child support but she also always insisted that I have a good relationship with my father. That is also the reason I grew up thinking that all the small and really insignificant things my father, grandparents, uncle and aunt, did for me were actually some big, important things that were crucial and totally necessary for my survival or better living standard. It took me years, when I was around 30 years old to finally realize that even if they were totally non-existent in my life, from their emotional to financial support, I would have still grew up to be as I am. Nothing they did, never had any real impact to my life. 

An example of that toxic and materialistic side of them: when I finished high school, my aunt asked if I wanted to babysit her children, my cousins which were around 2 and 5 years old at the time. Instead of spending my summer with friends and just enjoying life before University, I wanted to spend time with them and so I spent 3 whole months babysitting my cousins the whole day. Alone. What I got as a thank you for that was a laptop and some clothes to bring back home. Just to mention that both my aunt and uncle had a really good paying engineer jobs back then. Fast forward years later, 2018, I asked my aunt, uncle and cousins to come to my wedding, but they were too busy and couldn't take any vacation time. I asked them months before so they had plenty of time to plan for it. And the wedding was in January so they could've counted the vacation days from new year. Fast forward another couple of years, that same family is coming to their friend's daughter wedding. But I guess her daughter was having the wedding in Dubrovnik and her mother is a doctor, so it's more worthy event than some small insignificant wedding of your cousin and niece. 

I never wanted to cut ties with my younger cousins but they actually did it first. The same year as my wedding, 2019, my cousin actually came to Europe for a vacation, with her friends from US, visited our hometown and the city I live in now, and didn't even send a message to have a quick coffee or something. Honestly, them visiting all these years, never even messaging that they came, I just saw that over IG, and then finally finding out that all of them will attend that wedding of someone that isn't even family, but they were too busy to come to mine was the last straw. I just unfollowed my younger cousins on IG too. 

I actually had a huge fight with my father right before my wedding. He was planning to come, but I decided to cut ties with him completely so he wasn't there for my wedding and we haven't spoken since. 

I know through some other cousins that he still wants to communicate with me. And before I cut ties with him we actually had a couple of conversations where I tried to explain that he never actually treated me as part of ""his"" family. However, he goes around saying to other family and friends that he has no idea why I don't want to speak to him?! 

Like I said, I am already 37 years old, I have a son, a husband and don't want to waste my time on people that can't even admit to their own mistakes. 

I have been in a relationship with my husband since we were 22, and he actually knows very well each situation that I went through with my father and that side of family. I know he would be the first one to say if I am being extreme, but he actually fully supports my decision to cut all ties with them.

1fvsuld,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenGears/comments/1fvsuld/best_milk_frothers/,Best Milk Frothers,"Are you tired of your morning coffee lacking that creamy, café-quality froth? I feel you! There's nothing quite like the joy of sipping a velvety latte or a frothy cappuccino from the comfort of your own kitchen. After countless experiments with different milk frothers and plenty of caffeinated trial and error, I decided it was time to compile a list of the top contenders out there.

To evaluate the milk frothers, I read dozens of reviews and articles, then ordered five popular models from Amazon. I used each frother to prepare a variety of hot and cold drinks, experimenting with all the provided whisk attachments. I considered how easy it was to use on different settings, noted how long it took for the milk to heat up, and paid close attention to the amount of foam produced and how long it lasted. Cleaning was also a factor, along with how they looked on my countertop. I used each frother for at least two weeks to test durability and reliability.

This list is designed to help you make an informed decision quickly without spending hours searching because let’s face it, we have coffee to drink! I focused on the ability to create thick, long-lasting froth, smooth steamed milk, and quiet operation, alongside a powerful motor and quick heating times. Creating this list was a personal project for me, fueled by my quest for the perfect froth. Now, I’m excited to share my findings with you! I’d love to hear your thoughts or any frother experiences you’ve had, so feel free to drop a comment below!

[**Breville BMF600XL Cafe Milk Frother**](https://kitchengearhub.shop/milk-frother/#1)

The Breville Cafe Milk Frother stands out with its durable build and large 25-ounce capacity, perfect for making frothy drinks for a crowd. It comes with two frothing discs for cappuccino and latte textures, offering versatility. Though on the bulkier side, its sleek design and easy-to-clean pitcher make it a reliable, premium choice.

[**Nespresso Aeroccino 4 Refresh**](https://kitchengearhub.shop/milk-frother/#2)

With a ceramic interior and sleek black-and-chrome design, the Nespresso Aeroccino4 offers easy operation for both hot and cold milk frothing. While it produces decent froth, it falls short on creating thicker foam, especially with plant-based milks. The jug’s narrow design can be challenging to clean, but it's dishwasher safe, making it low-maintenance.

[**Secura Detachable Milk Frother**](https://kitchengearhub.shop/milk-frother/#3)

The Secura Detachable Milk Frother has a generous capacity of 8.4 ounces, perfect for larger drinks. Its stainless steel body feels durable, and the auto shut-off feature is a nice touch. However, over time, froth quality diminished, and it became noisy, though it remains a solid choice for everyday use.

[**Keurig Standalone Frother**](https://kitchengearhub.shop/milk-frother/#4)

Compact and affordable, the Keurig Standalone Frother is ideal for quick, hassle-free frothing. It’s easy to use with a minimalist interface and produces solid foam for small servings. The 6-ounce capacity might limit those wanting more, but the non-stick interior makes cleaning a breeze.

[**BIZEWO Milk Frother**](https://kitchengearhub.shop/milk-frother/#5)

The BIZEWO Milk Frother offers impressive versatility with its four functions and budget-friendly price. It creates excellent foam, though it’s a bit slow and can be messy when pouring. The stainless steel design feels light, but cleaning is simple thanks to the non-stick interior—an excellent pick for the price-conscious buyer.",1,1728023713.0,KitchenGears,0,1.0,False

He shared 50-50 custody with his third wife and my half-sister got, as far as I know, around 1000$ per month. She started University this year, Montclair State University to be specific, and will be attending as an Out-of-State student. His third wife separated from him when my half-sister was just a baby and moved back from the US to our hometown. I actually went to visit them almost every week. I have all the pictures of me and my half-sister sister when she was a one year old baby, and I was 19 years old. And actually at that time I had a really good relationship with his third wife, and was even telling her that she should think about getting back with my father. So they get back together, she moves back to US, and after 5 or so years, they got divorced and it was a really ugly divorce, where even I got blamed by his wife. The only reason my father got 50-50 custody was because she is bipolar. As they remained to live in US, I tried to communicate with my half-sister online, but got ignored completely with messages left unanswered. So I just gave up too, eventually. Even though I didn't even try to approach her on Instagram, for some reason she blocked me there. And I honestly don't care anymore. I have my own child, husband and family and don't need such selfish, materialistic and toxic people in my life. 

When I look back now, growing up without a father, especially during those critical early years, and especially during the war years, the trauma the stress and everything else just led to my need to be close to him, and that side of family, no matter what. 
My mom is too proud and that was actually the main reason for not asking for any child support but she also always insisted that I have a good relationship with my father. That is also the reason I grew up thinking that all the small and really insignificant things my father, grandparents, uncle and aunt, did for me were actually some big, important things that were crucial and totally necessary for my survival or better living standard. It took me years, when I was around 30 years old to finally realize that even if they were totally non-existent in my life, from their emotional to financial support, I would have still grew up to be as I am. Nothing they did, never had any real impact to my life. 

An example of that toxic and materialistic side of them: when I finished high school, my aunt asked if I wanted to babysit her children, my cousins which were around 2 and 5 years old at the time. Instead of spending my summer with friends and just enjoying life before University, I wanted to spend time with them and so I spent 3 whole months babysitting my cousins the whole day. Alone. What I got as a thank you for that was a laptop and some clothes to bring back home. Just to mention that both my aunt and uncle had a really good paying engineer jobs back then. Fast forward years later, 2018, I asked my aunt, uncle and cousins to come to my wedding, but they were too busy and couldn't take any vacation time. I asked them months before so they had plenty of time to plan for it. And the wedding was in January so they could've counted the vacation days from new year. Fast forward another couple of years, that same family is coming to their friend's daughter wedding. But I guess her daughter was having the wedding in Dubrovnik and her mother is a doctor, so it's more worthy event than some small insignificant wedding of your cousin and niece. 

I never wanted to cut ties with my younger cousins but they actually did it first. The same year as my wedding, 2019, my cousin actually came to Europe for a vacation, with her friends from US, visited our hometown and the city I live in now, and didn't even send a message to have a quick coffee or something. Honestly, them visiting all these years, never even messaging that they came, I just saw that over IG, and then finally finding out that all of them will attend that wedding of someone that isn't even family, but they were too busy to come to mine was the last straw. I just unfollowed my younger cousins on IG too. 

I actually had a huge fight with my father right before my wedding. He was planning to come, but I decided to cut ties with him completely so he wasn't there for my wedding and we haven't spoken since. 

I know through some other cousins that he still wants to communicate with me. And before I cut ties with him we actually had a couple of conversations where I tried to explain that he never actually treated me as part of ""his"" family. However, he goes around saying to other family and friends that he has no idea why I don't want to speak to him?! 

Like I said, I am already 37 years old, I have a son, a husband and don't want to waste my time on people that can't even admit to their own mistakes. 

I have been in a relationship with my husband since we were 22, and he actually knows very well each situation that I went through with my father and that side of family. I know he would be the first one to say if I am being extreme, but he actually fully supports my decision to cut all ties with them.

Evening time ideas?,"Hey I'm (29M) an Irish guy in town for the Halo event in the convention centre this weekend. It's my first time in the USA and was sure to do some reading on this sub (you guys/girls are so helpful!) to know what to check out, where to be sure to visit and what foods fo try before getting here Since arriving here on Monday night here's what I've covered:

* Foods: ludi's, Le Panier, Dick's drive-in, teriyaki from Yoshino, Starbucks reserve roastery (I'm not a big seafood guy)

* Activities: went to Jupiter and an Irish bar on Tuesday, checked out some of the various stalls and stores in downtown, paying respect to Bruce Lee's grave, high fived a random crackhead, the aquarium, watching the sunrise and sunset over Puget sound, gotten high

* Places: volunteer park, gasworks, explored capitol hill, some of Fremont, queen anne, space needle (didn't go up), Pike Place market

* Coffee: Starbucks reserve roastery, ghost alley, storyville, a cafe near volunteer park among some others

I've one or two other items I might do like smith or Columbia tower (I've seen people advise these over the space needle as it's pricey) but other than that I'm not sure what else I'd like to do, particularly in the evenings. It would be cool to check out some bars or even try to chat up some girls without using apps (hate em and they really fuck with my self confidence even though I dont think I'm terrible looking) but from what I've read here it seems like that would be barking up the wrong tree. The closest I got to asking a girl her number was with a staff member in Nordstrom I got to chatting to and I didn't wanna be *that guy* or put anyone in that position since they're literally at work.

Idk I guess I'm at a bit of a loss for other things to check out or how to meet and chat with locals, seems like the city's a bit quiet downtown or even up by capitol hill. I know there's a bunch of bars there but a lot of them seem super quiet. Is it just because it's a weekday?

Lemme know if you guys have any recommendations for other things to do while I'm still here or places to check out. And apologies if any of this comes across as rude or anything, it's not intended and I'm happy to be corrected and learn.
