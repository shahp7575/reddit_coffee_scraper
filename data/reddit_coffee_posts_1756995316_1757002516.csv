I've been asking her all week what kind of cake she wants. Whether I should bake one or buy one, what flavor she'd like and so on. She has been really adamant on telling me, and I thought it was because she doesn't like sweet cakes. She'll usually go for a coffee or tea based cake for a slight bitter taste. However when I asked what cake she'd like again this morning, my sister replied that she doesn't want to go through the same thing she went through on my birthday again.

For context, on my 24th birthday I bought myself 2 cakes, a smaller matcha cake and a medium sized vanilla cake. However I didn't know my boyfriend's brother made me a HUGE 3 leches cake. So I ended up with 3 cakes on my birthday. After the celebration, my boyfriend wanted me to go back to his apartment to watch movies and play videogames. He asked me to bring half of each cake with me, but for some reason I only took the vanilla one. I ended up leaving for a week because the day after my birthday, I fell down a flight of stairs and got injured. I didn't get hurt too seriously luckily, but my legs/hips were covered in bruises and it hurt to walk. 

Because of my cake mistake, my siblings had a really hard time eating all the cake I left behind. My sister couldn't finish the matcha cake before it went bad, while my brother ate the entirety of the 3 leches cake within the week for breakfast, lunch and dinner. According to my sister, they are rightfully sick of cake, and now she doesn't want a birthday cake in fear that she won't be able to finish it. 

I feel horribly about this. Turning 20 is a huge milestone, and I wanted to go all out by getting her a cake she'd love, but because of me she doesn't even want to think of cake. I hope she comes around and accepts my offer, even if it's just a small cupcake. I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself for ruining her 20th birthday cake.",1,1757002166.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

So for context, this friend has been in my life litterally from my birth. She is 1 year older than me, and for a longtime, she was like a sister to me, since I‚Äôm an only child. 

Fast forward to adulthood: we‚Äôre 29 and 28. We‚Äôve grown apart a little, because she dates dumb*sses, jump from a relationship to another, always saying that the guy ‚Äúis the one‚Äù‚Ä¶ She also get to our friends gatherings really late (we‚Äôre talking 2-3 hours late, which pisses me off REALLY bad.)

So recently I wasn‚Äôt in a good place psychologically. I scheduled an appointment with a specialist, and asked her to come. She agreed, telling me ‚Äúshe‚Äôll always be there for me‚Äù. The appointment was an hour away, and i was driving since she had her car in the shop. 

The whole (ENTIRE) way there, she was on her phone, texting in a group chat, organizing a girls trip. 

I have to remind you, I‚Äôm not feeling good at all, and the fact that she‚Äôs planning this NEXT TO ME, while I‚Äôm hanging by a tread, was truly infuriating. 

So we get there, we‚Äôre waiting in the waiting room, amd she still has eyes only for her phone. I‚Äôm called in the office, i get up, and I walk toward the office, I turn to see my friend, and she hasn‚Äôt even got her eyes off of her phone. I don‚Äôt she even realised I got up. 

In the office, I cry, I talk, and somehow it made me feel better. 

As I get out of the office, I stop by the desk to schedule another appointment. I get back in the waiting room, and I say to my friend:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready to leave.‚Äù

She finally gets her eyes off of her phone, and she says:

‚ÄúWell that was long‚Äù

THAT WAS LONG!?!? Sorry, i‚Äôve been such an inconvenience! So we get back in the car, and back home we go. During the ride, her phone battery dies. She asks me if she can take my phone. I just do a hand gesture of approval. I get back to her place, she gets out of the car, and says:

‚ÄúCome on in, we‚Äôll have coffee and talk.‚Äù

The red mist got the best of me and I said:

‚ÄúNo thank you, I‚Äôm not interested in watching text and giggle.‚Äù

So I left. She‚Äôs been ‚Äúchecking in‚Äù a few times, but today, I told her that I didn‚Äôt want her in my life anymore. Our values don‚Äôt align anymore. And we‚Äôve definitely grown too much apart. 

So AITAH for removing her from my life? ",2,1757002159.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Sophie (an alias) has been my best friend since school. We‚Äôve always been so close but also throughout uni and work etc we‚Äôve had different friendship groups. I‚Äôve always tried to be present until now. Sophie has always been a great friend to me, always there when I need her most, but the last 3 ish years I really don‚Äôt know if I like her anymore‚Ä¶ She always favoured her other best friend over me, which is fine, but they‚Äôre not friends anymore because her friendship group fell out with her and she said ‚Äúit was hard to be friends with her when my friends didn‚Äôt get on with her, it just didn‚Äôt work‚Äù. This has always been at the back of my mind‚Ä¶.

3 years ago Sophie asked me to be her MOH - I accepted and was so excited. I planned all the hens, put everything into it and it was hard at the time because her bridesmaids didn‚Äôt care. 6 months before the wedding is when I really saw a shift in Sophie - but I put it down to wedding stress. Sophie said to me and her other friend that we can‚Äôt get engaged in May (month of her wedding), then a few weeks later her and her husband to be were over mine with my partner and told us that she‚Äôd prefer if we didn‚Äôt get engaged in the next 6 months because she couldn‚Äôt be truly happy for me because she‚Äôs thinking about her own wedding. I did feel quite upset and it was awkward but I let it go because it was a stressful time. 

The wedding came and went and then me and her bridesmaid were at a mutual‚Äôs party and the wedding came up and I said to her its been nice to have some space from the bridal party and at times I did feel frustrated because it felt I was doing everything and the bridesmaids weren‚Äôt. The bridesmaid agreed and said she was going through something and I said fair enough - we were together all nice after this - no issues and were getting on so well. On the next night out a month later she was still fine with me. Sophie messaged the following morning saying I needed to be careful what I say when I‚Äôm drunk, and that what I said to the bridesmaid had hurt her (Sophie). It didn‚Äôt even come from the bridesmaid, it came from the other one who had heard it from the other - she told her I had said I don‚Äôt like any of them. Sophie had firmly made her decision that I had said this - didn‚Äôt ask and really cornered me. We weren‚Äôt the same after that. 

Months went by and she didn‚Äôt make the effort, I was only good for coffee - every time we saw each other she was 30/40 mins late. This May we went to a concert together and we spoke about everything and we were on really good terms - until last week when she messaged asking me where her wedding present was and that she was hurt I didn‚Äôt get one for her. I told her that I needed space after some back and forth about me saying everything I did was a wedding present and I was poor having bought a house and MOH for another friend the same month (I spent so much money between the pair). She came to me 4 days later saying I had made her ill because of my ridiculous space and was so aggressive I cut her off and haven‚Äôt spoken to her since.

Today I had 3 shots of vodka in the space of 10 mins along with my breakfast. It literally does nothing for me mentally except make me less anxious (I was still experiencing some social anxiety) with generally blunting my awareness of everything around me and making me sleepy, less overstimulated, slower mentally (despite being fully articulate and able to do mental maths) and more relaxed but not fully.

I know everyone responds differently but I'm wandering if with any larger amount of alcohol I could even get to the point of enjoying my experience tipsy. 

So far the physical symptoms at 3 shots far negatively outweigh the only benefit which is really not overthinking as much, and I can't imagine myself craving it again. I'm literally underweight and this is my second drink ever after yesterday (lol) The high I feel on half a cup of coffee is so much more potent.

It's been 19days since DDay. My partner (28M) and I(28F) moved in at the start of 2024. It was a rough move. We we're having a lot of trouble with the living together.
For context - I moved out from my parents house to the apt for ~ 16 months  with the plan of moving in with him at the end of that lease. I didn't want to move from parents directly to his home bc I felt it was important for me to live alone to learn how to take care of myself. 

After the move his feelings were that I didn't learn much bc I was disorganized with meal planning and we were struggling finding space to put things from my apt in the house. Most of it was shoved up in the attic or in my room at my parents. 

These issues resulted in a sparse sex life which was not our norm - we were quite frequent I guess :/ 

July of '24 he came home drunk from a party and initiated sex and I guess I was desperate for connection so I engaged. He slapped me a few times, and normally I don't mind it but I had asked him to stop a few months prior. Kinky sex was a part of our life in different ways but previously it was communicative, after moving in ... It felt functional? Like he wasn't enjoying it and I felt really used. So the slapping and the more rough parts of sex started feeling less intimate and more hurtful. 
I chalked it up to his drunk self just forgetting that I'd asked to stop so I stopped him abruptly and reminded him to not continue.. He then said he'd like to eat someone else out with me and that I'd have to share him from then on and I freaked out and stopped sex altogether. This is when I realized just how drunk he was I guess, bc I could tell he didn't know what he JUST said bc he sounded distraught that he'd done something to hurt me. He asked if I was ok, what happened, what did he say? But I was too shocked to answer. When I told him the next day he was very apologetic and he assured me that's not something he wanted and I just couldn't bring myself to get over it. It played in my head again and again. I found old things from his exes - love letters and cute gifts of 'reasons why I love you' etc. and this really got my insecurities going. I thought maybe he regretted our relationship and felt like he was in too deep to leave... I felt very insecure of being cheated on as multiple different past partners have cheated on me and it's not the best for my already non existent self esteem. 

I asked to go to couples therapy to work that and he BLEW up. Very defensive and told me I was not doing anything around the house and not treating the house as if it was my house too. I didn't take any initiative on the house tasks or projects, I didnt seem to WANT anything to do with it... Which is fair and I saw his perspective but all around felt invalidated and just felt like I shoved my own worries and issues under the rug bc it felt stupid to be so hung up on it - he shows me he loves me in many ways - I told myself, and said I just need to believe it and stop being so insecure. I brought up couples therapy like 3 times and each time he got defensive so I backed off. He booked a therapist the first time after his initial emotionally charged reaction but it felt like he did it out of anger and I canceled it bc I didn't wanna go to therapy if we weren't both going with the goal of getting better at our relationship.

So this insecurity persisted. We almost got married may 2025 - immigration concerns and timeline. But then didn't bc we couldn't even agree on how to get married. He finally brought up therapy himself - I agreed thinking finally - and it was horrible. Our therapist was a bad match and we got into worse arguments about stupid stuff. We scheduled with a new one even when he didn't want to bc I wasn't giving up now that we started

I invaded his privacy - read his diary/journal- and found out that he cheated in the first ish months of dating. This was when our exclusivity was ill-defined and while it bothered me there was also a lot of content about falling in love with me and how he didn't expect it and whatever. I guess I didn't care about this (it's been almost 7 years now and I admit our exclusivity was ill-defined IDK) but I went on his phone without permission on aug16 and found out he'd been talking to an old friend. It was just flirty texts. I can't get it out of my head. It's only been going on about a month. They met for coffee in Princeton and he tells me there was no physical contact. He tells me he was just using her for attention and not actually interested in her. That it felt good to feel wanted. I am really angry at this bc that's literally all I've been asking him. For connection - to feel like he cares about my fucking feelings. He's been remorseful. He's cried to me for the first time about his own depression. I can see his shame and regret and know he is deeply sorry. But it feels like this flipped a switch and he's all of a sudden able to empathize with me and I'm so angry that this is what it took. Where was this empathy when I was begging for some kind of reassurance of love and connection? 

And now it's just red. Im so angry. I can't get the anger out. I told him to end it and send her a message and that I wanted to see it beforehand and I wanted input and what he needs to say and he did it without showing me and says he just forgot  - that he wanted to do it sooner than later and get it over with like a bandaid. He sounds apologetic and I believe him that he forgot bc we're both fucking anxious. Like I GET IT. But I'm so over trying to empathize anymore and I feel like it just hit me like a truck when he told me he sent her the message on snap didnt save anything - deleted everything immediately after and he doesn't even have a draft. And he told me what he said it was the worst thing he could have fucking said and I just feel angry. And hurt. And angrier bc he messed up again. I'm so so so angry and hurt I literally can barely focus on work.

The first week after DDay I felt like there was hope bc he was opening up and he was responding to me asking for my needs and he was checking in often (he still is) but - this mess up (his message to her and my lack of input. What he said) he reaches out for connection and I just want to be mean. I am angrier than anger? Furious seems understating too. 
Help me. How do I quell this anger? How do I move past it to accept his apologies bc it all feels fake and I want him to grovel for my forgiveness for me to not give it. I want him to hurt the way I hurt and I hate this feeling bc I know it's just charged emotions - I wouldn't ever act on this and it makes me feel more like I'm burying my feelings. I feel so lost.

1n8ecy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1n8ecy9/for_people_with_social_anxiety_disorder_and_adhd/,for people with social anxiety disorder and ADHD,"Howdy,

Just wanted to help people who have this situation and how I have managed to get things under control.Starting off with having anxiety attacks from age 19, not regularly but got mild ones every once in a while.Over the years I knew that I had issues and could not cope and did not have the money or necessity to visit the doctors to see what could possibly be the case, until about a half a year ago I started getting back bad anxiety attacks.(by bad ones I MEAN BAD..) and I'm like 30 now

starting off, I went to see a GP first..It was in the situation when I was shaking and crying for help.I already had forbidden myself of so many things like drinking alcohol, coffee..forced myself to go to the nature and talking to my family every day..this worked for a while and thats maybe it was mild instead of severe.

my GP was concerned and got me to Zoloft first, that made my anxiety even worse..It went from BAD to worse where I tought I have to tighten myself on a chair and fight with my brain to not hurt myself.I was trying them over 6 weeks and unfortunately it was not helping.We stopped them straight away and I went on Effexor XR, and let me tell you! within a week I was just doing so much better. Starting with 32.5 and second week up to 75 and now 105.

It gave me everything back what I needed, the confidence and joy of life, but I STILL had mild anxiety.After a month of trying Effexor I started to use dr google to see what is wrong with me and wrote down as many ideas that I could and found out that I have ADHD aswell, 2 in 1 package baby! As I went to see my GP and explained this, then she said that I have to do an expensive ADHD assessment.. and yeah it turned out that I had 98% ADHD aswell.

The next thing I had to ring up a available psychraisist who can prescribe the medication for it, the waiting times where about 3-9months, but managed to get a spot 7 weeks after the assessment was done. Had to do an assessment with them aswell, paying lots of $$$$. After the proper diagnosis I finally managed to get the medication, trying different ones and most of them started to work immediately.They all have different reactions and can't recommend what is better or worse.But most of them did magic and all the fear and worries where gone!

In conclusion, I don't recommend medicine lol..as I'm usually the one who is even not taking anything for headaches, but after going trough so much I feel like if YOU think that you have something similar then 100% try it out and see what works the best for you!

Guests don‚Äôt want paperwork or desk drama‚Äîthey want keys on their phone, a coffee in hand, and to already be in their room.

What‚Äôs changing fast:

* 73% of guests now prefer mobile check-in over the desk.
* Digital check-in flows add 15‚Äì20% more upsell revenue.
* AI upsells can drive **up to 200% more revenue**.
* Properties using AI for service recovery are seeing **300% more positive reviews**.

Case in point: Ace Hotel rolled out mobile check-in. Guests skipped the lobby lines, staff weren‚Äôt stuck printing key cards, and suddenly there was time for actual hospitality‚Äîgreeting people, giving local tips, upselling the bar without extra staff.

**Takeaway:** Tech smooths the friction. People seal the memory.

The catch? OTAs like Booking and Airbnb are already training travelers to expect personalization. When a guest experiences a seamless journey somewhere else, they‚Äôll compare every future stay against it. If hotels don‚Äôt adapt, they risk losing loyalty (and revenue) fast.

Curious what you all think:

* If you‚Äôre in hospitality, are you seeing guest expectations shift this way?
* If you‚Äôre a frequent traveler, do you prefer mobile check-in, or do you still like the front desk experience?

1n8eacb,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1n8eacb/helped_with_crippling_reflux/,Helped with crippling reflux,"A few days ago had a nightmare reflux flare. Laying on the couch, I discovered Mayhill on a Youtube video. Ordered the ascorbic acid and  stopped carbs, completely. That night, the pain in my back and belly, headache, bloating and cramping lessened by 75%. Was able to finally sleep through the night without pain and didn't need my PPI, used only 2  Pepcid instead. That was the first night. In the morning stuffiness eased and energy was up, no longer felt like a zombie, a bit more hopeful but cautious since I have tried all miracle cures, supplements, reflux diets and wasted thousands because nothing ever worked. 

This is even more humiliating to me because with all of my nursing knowledge, I could not depend on traditional medicine protocols to heal what was diagnosed as GERD. It's only been my second day on Myhill's regimen and I'm cautiously optimistic. I was feeling a bit trash earlier because I still haven't figured out how to drink my coffee without dairy or sugar and this was driving me a bit nuts. So I cheated and added heavy cream and two tablespoons of raw honey to a small cup of coffee and waited with great fear to see if the godawful acid would resurface. Immediately, the slight burning returned. So not sure what other folks here mean when they say they don't feel well on this diet, if it's just feeling funky and cheated because we can't eat what we want. Reflux has really humbled me. Will do anything to feel myself again.

So tomorrow, I am going to go back to the strict induction phase Myhill recommends. Hate the discipline but prefer being pain free. So will try to keep you all updated. Not even sure if this is the right post to post this but hope this gives someone a ray of hope. Got to keep trying till we get it right.

Almost slammed in the back end because of it.  I didn't.  I'm not going to lay out the entire thought process here, by that's where it started.
------------------------------------------------------

This is a diptych concept.   Two stories covering the same events, from two different perspectives and told in two different narrative tones, almost two completely separate genres.

The first is a high action thriller/heist story, focusing on the stuff.  Cade ""Clutch"" Callahan is a widower, living alone, and retired Hollywood stunt driver/coordinator who sees a family being evicted, and watches the landlord drive off like a maniac.  He realizes that he could use his professional skills to orchestrated masterful accidents of such precision that no one is physically harmed but the other driver is found at total fault. That is his one absolute rule, no one gets hurt.  Ever.  He then files a fraudulent insurance claim on behalf of the evicted family.  It works, and so he does it again, and again, becoming a modern day Robin Hood of the road, always helping someone in a financial crisis without ever revealing himself to them.  The recipients don't know how. It's a miracle. 

The other book is more of a noir-style detective story. Carefully following clues, looking for hidden details.  In it, we have Evelyn Reed, young, brilliant, sophisticated, professionally renowned insurance investigator.  She starts to notice a pattern in some of the case file she's been given.  Drivers with a risky history, limited witnesses, big payouts for families of the edge of collapse.  She starts to suspect a ""guardian angel"" is deliberately causing the accidents out of some twisted sense of justice.  When Evie goes to her boss with the theories, she's ignored; the level of precision required to pull it off would be beyond human limitations.  Discouraged, her theory leads to a deeper investigation, becoming an obsession that damages her professional reputation.  She's a contemporary Captain Ahab.   She's right, but how does she prove it?

Both books follow the exact same period, and will have overlaps.  Details revealed in one might send seem relatively unimportant, but add a while new context to the other.   And it doesn't matter which is read first.  They support each other without spoiling each other.

1n8e9rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n8e9rc/does_the_tasty_mini_sandwich_maker_deliver_a/,Does the Tasty Mini Sandwich Maker Deliver? A Detailed Review Inside!,"The **Tasty TY11698-1 Mini Sandwich Maker** has become an unexpected yet delightful addition to my kitchen. Compact, stylish, and full of utility, it‚Äôs surprising how much this tiny wonder packs in terms of performance. After weeks of regular use during busy mornings and late-night snack cravings, this sandwich maker has proven to be a hardworking companion, though with some caveats.

**Compact and Lightweight Design**  
Its small footprint and portability immediately caught my attention. The vibrant aqua-colored stainless steel body adds a modern charm to the kitchen. Weighing just over two pounds, it‚Äôs incredibly lightweight and fits snugly into any corner of the countertop or into a storage cabinet. As someone living in a modest apartment, having an appliance that doesn‚Äôt monopolize counter space is a big win. However, I did notice its size limits the portions, which might be a concern for families or larger households.

**Versatile Culinary Possibilities**  
This gadget isn‚Äôt just for sandwiches, which became clear as I started experimenting. In addition to perfectly toasted paninis and grilled cheese, I used it to make crisp yet fluffy waffles, indulgent pizza pockets bursting with cheese, and even breakfast French toast. Its versatility genuinely surprised me‚Äîit‚Äôs like having a mini culinary workshop on the counter. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for larger or stuffed fillings since the compact cooking surface might struggle to handle bulkier items evenly.

[Check Tasty TY11698-1 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cbd3z29f/)

**Dual-Sided Nonstick Cooking Surface**  
The dual-sided cooking plates are remarkably efficient. They heat up evenly and deliver results in a matter of minutes. I appreciated the nonstick surface, free from PFAS and PFOA, making both cooking and cleanup effortless. After making a particularly gooey grilled cheese sandwich (cheddar everywhere!), a simple wipe cleaned up everything without any residue left behind. However, if you‚Äôre using sticky ingredients like marshmallows or sugary syrups, you might need a little more elbow grease.

**Performance and Power**  
Armed with 600 watts of power, this sandwich maker cooks surprisingly fast. Many mornings, I‚Äôve managed to whip up breakfast sandwiches before my coffee brewed, which feels like a minor miracle. Its ability to seal and crisp the edges of sandwiches lends a professional touch. But there‚Äôs a downside‚Äîthose 600 watts don‚Äôt leave much room for temperature adjustment. The lack of customizable settings may frustrate those wanting more precise control over browning.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Compact and easy to store, making it suitable for small spaces.  
- Provides quick results with a powerful 600-watt system.  
- Dual-sided nonstick plates are PFAS and PFOA-free, ensuring safe cooking.  
- Versatile enough to make sandwiches, desserts, and even creative snacks like pizza pockets.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Only fits small portions, which might not cater to families or groups.  
- Lack of temperature control limits customization for toastiness or crispness.  

**Competitors**  
Compared to other mini sandwich makers, this one fares well due to its quick results and stylish design. For instance, while the Dash Mini Maker is similarly compact and offers a comparable cooking surface, its cooking plates don‚Äôt seal and crisp as effectively. Another competitor, the Cuisinart Grill and Panini Press, brings more robust features like adjustable temperature settings but is larger and significantly more expensive. The Tasty model strikes a balance by remaining accessible, functional, and affordable, though I do miss the flexibility that temperature control adds.

**Quality for Price**  
Given the features and efficiency it delivers, this sandwich maker certainly offers value for money. Its durability, energy efficiency, and nonstick surface all add to its appeal. While it might not replace larger panini presses or griddles for a complete kitchen solution, it‚Äôs ideal for someone like me who craves convenience with minimal setup or cleanup. The cost aligns well with its compact size and straightforward functionality‚Äîdefinitely a solid purchase for someone on a budget.

*‚ÄúPost more consistently. Use Shorts. Repurpose your long videos.‚Äù*  
  
But when you actually try to **clip a long-form YouTube video** or make a Reel, you hit the same wall:  

* Watching through hours of footage 
* Manually cropping video to vertical format 
* Adding captions 
* Exporting videos for each platform

By the time you are done, you are exhausted, and your next upload is already waiting.

**Introducing: vidIQ‚Äôs AI Clipping Tool**  


[AI Shorts Clipping](https://i.redd.it/b2hdllpv76nf1.gif)

  
Given a long-form video, here is what it does:

**1. Auto-detects your best moments**  
Upload your video or paste a link, and the AI analyzes it to **create Shorts from YouTube videos** in minutes. You can also add prompts like ‚Äúfind the biggest laugh‚Äù or ‚Äúhighlight key tips‚Äù for even better results.

**2. Crops and captions for you**  
It reframes your video to vertical, keeps the focus on the speaker, and generates captions automatically.¬†

**3. Optimized for every platform**  
Whether you need a **YouTube video to Shorts converter** or a **YouTube long video to short video** workflow, this tool delivers. The output works perfectly across YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Reels.

**4. AI-powered titles and metadata**  
Get keyword suggestions and titles to help your clips rank better and reach more viewers.

# Why it works

* Post more, grow faster. Daily clips mean better algorithm visibility (have you seen our [research on posting frequency](https://vidiq.com/blog/post/How-Often-Post-on-Youtube/)?
* Repurpose what you already have. Turn past livestreams, podcasts, or vlogs into dozens of clips. 
* One upload, multiple platforms. Publish the same **YouTube convert video to short** clip everywhere. 
* Save hours. No more manually using a **YouTube video clip cutter** or expensive editors.

# Example Workflow

Got a one-hour livestream? Here is how to turn it into a week of content:

1. Paste the link into the tool.
2. Ask the AI to find the funniest moments or best tips.
3. Pick clip length 20 to 45 seconds, 45 to 60 seconds, or 60 seconds plus.
4. Grab a coffee while it processes.
5. Download 10 or more polished clips.
6. Post them to Shorts, Reels, and TikTok.  

One upload becomes multiple videos across platforms.

# What to know

* AI is not magic. Sometimes you will want to tweak styling or select different clips.
* Great for scale, not pixel-perfect edits. For that you will still need manual editing tools.
* Available as part of your vidIQ Boost subscription. Same price, more benefits.

# TL;DR

If you want more views, **post more content**.  
vidIQ‚Äôs AI Clipping tool is like a **YouTube Shorts maker** that helps you repurpose existing videos quickly. It is the fastest way to **clip YouTube videos**, convert them into Shorts, and post everywhere without the editing grind.

In the chaos of our twenties, there are successes that look good in photos and disappointments no one talks about. Each day moves with small triumphs like finishing a deadline or reconnecting with a friend. But at night, when the lights are out and things get quiet, a certain emptiness sits right next to my bed. There is a chair that has always been there. I never picked it or decided where it should go, but it somehow belongs.

Some nights, it is easy to ignore. I get lost in my phone, jump from conversation to conversation, and let hours drift away. But sometimes, when sleep won‚Äôt come and my mind is busy, the chair feels very close. It does not say anything, does not offer comfort or judgment. Sometimes it seems to hold shapes from the past, like wishes that were never fulfilled or versions of myself I only met in daydreams. Other times, it is just a silent spot in a room that is otherwise filled with noise.

The chair does not tell me its name. I might call it loneliness or restlessness or just not knowing. All it does is hold space. It is the one place in my life that does not pretend or demand, does not need to be fixed or described. At the end of long days, I sometimes find myself sitting there, not really knowing why, legs tucked up, listening to nothing. It is then I see the chair is not a problem at all. It is just space. It is honest, not asking me to be anything in particular.

With time, I think everyone gets a chair like this. Some try to hide it under clothes. Some change rooms or move to new cities, hoping it will not come along. But it does, setting itself quietly in the corner no matter where you end up.

One morning I might stop moving and just sit with it. I make some coffee and notice how the light falls on its armrest. In that pause, the chair feels less empty. Maybe it even feels like a friend. Still quiet, but now it belongs. It is just waiting for me to accept all the space inside me.

Maybe what felt like emptiness was always an invitation. The chair remains, the most loyal thing in the room, waiting to be claimed.",2,1757001662.0,TwentiesIndia,1,1.0,False

Just read Pieces of Her by Karin Slaughter (The one with the Netflix show!) - My Honest Thoughts & Tips for New Thriller Readers!

---

Hey everyone! I just finished reading *Pieces of Her* by Karin Slaughter, and wow, what a ride! You might know it from the Netflix series, and the book is just as gripping. I picked up my copy of [Pieces of Her - Karin Slaughter](https://pdfhive.com/pieces-of-her-karin-slaughter/) because I'd heard so much buzz, and I wanted to share my honest, no-spoilers thoughts with you all, especially if you're thinking about diving into a thrilling mystery.

### The Story (No Spoilers!)

At its heart, *Pieces of Her* introduces us to Andrea Oliver, a young woman whose life takes an unimaginable turn during a seemingly ordinary lunch with her mother, Laura. What follows is a shocking act of violence that unravels the comfortable life Andrea thought she knew. She quickly discovers that her mother, the quiet speech pathologist she's always admired, has a past she's kept hidden for decades. Andrea embarks on a journey to uncover the truth, which forces her to confront danger, deception, and the chilling realization that her mother might be someone entirely different.

### What I Liked

First off, Karin Slaughter is a master of suspense. From the very first chapter, I was hooked. The pacing in this book is just phenomenal; it starts with a bang and rarely lets up. I loved how the story switches between Andrea's present-day quest and flashbacks to Laura's mysterious past. This dual timeline kept me constantly guessing and eager to connect the dots.

The characters, especially Laura, are incredibly complex and well-developed. Laura is such a compelling figure ‚Äì seemingly gentle, yet clearly harboring deep secrets and a hidden strength. Andrea's journey of self-discovery and resilience as she pieces together her mother's life was also really engaging. The emotions felt raw and real; I could feel Andrea's confusion, fear, and determination. Slaughter's writing style is direct and impactful, painting vivid pictures without getting bogged down in unnecessary details, which is perfect for a fast-paced thriller.

### What I Didn't Like (Or Found Challenging)

While I genuinely enjoyed the book, I have to admit it's not a light read. The subject matter can be quite intense, dealing with themes of violence, trauma, and identity. Some parts might feel a little dark for those who prefer lighter fare. Also, there were a couple of instances where Andrea's decisions felt a bit questionable, which sometimes made me want to shout at the page! But honestly, these are minor points compared to the overall brilliance of the story.

1n8dylz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n8dylz/should_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_bunn_csb3t_be/,Should the best drip coffee maker BUNN CSB3T be your next pick?,"Using the BUNN CSB3T has undoubtedly changed how I approach coffee-making every morning. This coffee maker isn't just functional; it's an experience in itself. The speed and reliability it offers have made it a daily companion in my kitchen. What immediately caught my attention was its ability to brew 10 cups in around four minutes. No more endless waiting for my caffeine fix.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek black and stainless steel finish is more than just eye-catching; it‚Äôs built to last. It complements any kitchen aesthetic, which I appreciate. Its relatively compact design for a 10-cup machine fits easily on my counter without crowding the space. However, it‚Äôs not lightweight, which I generally consider a good sign of durability. The removable thermal carafe is a game-changer, keeping coffee hot for over two hours‚Äîperfect for leisurely morning sipping or hosting visitors. While the commercial-grade stainless steel tank and double-walled carafe scream premium, I did notice the machine can feel a tad heavy when moving it around.

**Ease of Use and User Interface**  
The BUNN CSB3T is incredibly simple to start using. Everything from the water-level indicator to the multi-stream spray head feels tailored for convenience. As someone who‚Äôs not a morning person, I loved that I could simply pour water into the bowl, and the machine takes over from there with hardly any babysitting required. That said, the manual operation might not be for everyone‚Äîespecially those used to more automated systems with notification sounds or an auto-turnoff mode.

**Advantages**  
- The internal commercial-grade stainless steel tank keeps water at the ideal brewing temperature.  
- Consistency? Absolutely. Every cup tastes just as rich and full-bodied as the last.  
- No unnecessary tech clutter. Clean and purposeful.  
- The taller funnel and custom filters practically eliminate any irritating overflow issues.  

[See BUNN CSB3T deals on Amazon now.](https://vendm.com/p/b07gy6phyz/)

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
Calling it ""speed brew"" isn't just a marketing gimmick; I timed it. Making a full 50-ounce carafe took four minutes flat, while filling my 20-ounce travel mug took under two minutes. The commercial-style spray head not only ensures even coffee ground saturation but also establishes a depth of flavor that's genuinely reminiscent of what I get at my favorite caf√©. The temperature regulation contributes significantly to this. Competitors often overshoot, leaving coffee with that bitter ""burnt"" taste, but this machine lands it just right. However, this efficiency comes with a need to keep it plugged in to maintain the internal water‚Äôs heat, which could bother those mindful of electricity usage.

**Disadvantages**  
- You must keep the machine plugged in constantly to maintain its quick-brew capability.  
- Manual operation‚Äîthere‚Äôs no programmable timer for those wanting a pre-scheduled brew.  
- The machine stays warm, which might not sit well with everyone when thinking about energy conservation.  

**Product Rivals**  
When stacked against well-known competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Breville Precision Brewer, the BUNN CSB3T holds its ground in multiple ways. Unlike the Moccamaster, which excels in its handmade design aesthetic but takes longer to brew, this machine prioritizes speed and simplicity. Breville's Precision Brewer offers versatile temperature settings and automation features, but such complexity doesn‚Äôt always appeal to users wanting a straightforward experience. Yet, one area where rival products edge out is energy efficiency. My Breville setup included a power-saving auto-off, something I occasionally miss on the BUNN. However, the consistent coffee taste and incredibly swift brewing make up for that.

**Value for Money**  
Despite tasting premium with every cup brewed, the machine remains surprisingly accessible price-wise. What you're getting here is a commercial-grade brewing mechanism packed into a home-friendly coffee maker. I‚Äôve tried subpar equipment that chugs along at twice the cost. This helps redefine what ‚Äúbang for the buck‚Äù is‚Äîfor less than you‚Äôd expect, you‚Äôre bringing caf√©-level satisfaction to your own home. Still, if you weren‚Äôt planning on keeping the coffee maker plugged in constantly, it might lose part of its value to you in the long run.

1n8dyjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1n8dyjd/explore_if_bissell_pet_pro_oxy_carpet_cleaner/,Explore if Bissell Pet Pro OXY Carpet Cleaner Beats Set-In Stains,"Testing out the Bissell 2034 PET PRO OXY Spot & Stain Formula for portable carpet cleaners has been quite an adventure for me and my household. As a pet owner with two constantly energetic dogs and a very independent cat, my carpets and upholstery tend to face endless bouts with paw prints, food stains, and the occasional pet accident. This product has been a lifesaver in ways I didn‚Äôt anticipate, but there‚Äôs also a couple of things to note about its performance and practicality. Let me break it down for you.

**A Formula Crafted for the Messy Realities of Life**  
One thing that immediately stood out to me about this pet stain remover is how it was specifically formulated for cleaning spots and stains caused by pets. From urine and vomit to tracked-in dirt and even blood, this stuff refuses to leave a mess untreated. I used it on a deeply embedded coffee spill on an area of carpet my cat knocked over, alongside defeating some stubborn paw prints, and it performed impressively well. It also left behind a lingering fresh scent that I found pleasant and not too overpowering.  

[Ready to buy Bissell 2034? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b09mqxhjr5/)  

**Performance on High-Traffic Areas and Upholstery**  
With high-traffic zones like my living room, which doubles up as my pets‚Äô playground, stains never fail to appear. This product not only cleans well but also worked wonders on my fabric couch where my dog enjoys napping. Using it with a portable carpet cleaner made the process efficient. I rarely had to go over the same spot twice, which saved me time and effort. Refreshing carpeted stairs was another unexpected bonus I didn‚Äôt think I needed.  

**Eco-Friendly and Safe for Families**  
Knowing that this formula doesn‚Äôt contain any heavy metals, phosphates, or dyes gave me a lot of peace of mind. As someone with nieces and nephews who frequently visit, and pets actively involved in every part of my life, safety was a big concern. It‚Äôs also made in a way that‚Äôs evaluated to be better for the environment‚Äîit earned the Safer Choice label by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That effort toward safer and healthier cleaning is a win in my book, especially compared with other harsher chemical cleaners I‚Äôve previously used.  

**Strong Points**  
- Truly tackles tough pet stains like urine, feces, and vomit effectively  
- Eliminates lasting odors while leaving a fresh scent  
- Safer for children and pets when used appropriately  
- Doesn‚Äôt compromise quality even in hard-to-reach spots or high-traffic areas  

**Pitfalls**  
- Using it exclusively with portable carpet cleaners means additional equipment costs for effectiveness  
- Formula scent may not suit those who prefer completely neutral cleaners  
- Doesn‚Äôt eliminate all deeper stains after a single use‚Äîrequires persistence  

**Competitive Options in the Market**  
When it comes to pet stain removers, there‚Äôs no shortage of options out there, but comparing the product to brands like Nature‚Äôs Miracle and Resolve is an interesting exercise. Nature‚Äôs Miracle also offers a pet stain and odor remover that‚Äôs safe around pets and children, but I‚Äôve found its scent a bit overwhelming. Resolve‚Äôs stain remover works well too but doesn‚Äôt seem to tackle pet-specific stains with the same efficiency as this one. The portability aspect combined with safer ingredients makes Bissell‚Äôs offering a notch above what most other brands provide.  

**Cost-Efficiency**  
Looking at the product for its features and performance, it‚Äôs definitely a purchase that feels worthwhile. For households managing kids and pets, it ensures safety and delivers effective cleaning without constant reapplication. Of course, price fluctuation always plays a role, but its quality for price ratio leans heavily toward being worth every penny.

I destroyed my marriage at my mother-in-law's 60th birthday party last weekend and I think I might be the worst person alive.

My husband and I have been together for twelve years, married for eight. We have two kids, 10 and 7. His brother is two years younger and has always been the ""fun"" one in the family while my husband is more serious and work-focused.

About six months ago, my brother-in-law started texting me more. At first it was just funny memes and stuff about the kids. Then it became longer conversations. He would ask how I was doing, really listen when I complained about feeling lonely. My husband works late most nights and weekends, so I was home alone a lot.

The texting turned into meeting for coffee. Then lunch. Then more.

I told myself it was just emotional support. Someone finally understood me. My brother-in-law would say things like ""You deserve so much better"" and ""I see how unhappy you are."" When my husband forgot our anniversary dinner because of a work crisis, his brother took me out instead.

The physical stuff started about two months ago. I knew it was wrong but I felt alive again. We were careful. Or so I thought.

Last Saturday was the birthday party at my mother-in-law's house. About forty people were there, including extended family, neighbors, family friends. My brother-in-law and I snuck upstairs to one of the spare bedrooms during dinner.

My husband came looking for me to help serve cake.

He opened the door and saw us. The look on his face will haunt me forever. He just stood there for maybe ten seconds, then walked away without saying anything.

I panicked. I threw on my clothes and ran downstairs. My husband was in the kitchen, gripping the counter so hard his knuckles were white.

""We need to talk,"" he said quietly.

But people were starting to notice something was wrong. His mom kept asking what was happening. Extended family was staring at us.

This is where I became a monster. Instead of telling the truth, I got defensive and mean.

""Fine, you want to do this here?"" I said loudly enough for people to hear. ""I'm tired of pretending everything's okay when you're drunk every night by eight and I'm basically a single parent.""

The room went dead quiet. My husband stared at me in shock.

""That's not true and you know it,"" he said.

But I kept going. ""How many nights do I put the kids to bed alone while you're passed out on the couch? How many school events have you missed because you're hungover?""

None of this was true. My husband drinks maybe two beers on weekends. He's never missed a school event. He's actually an incredible father.

His brother tried to stop me. ""Hey, maybe we should all just calm down.""

""Don't,"" my husband said to his brother. His voice was so cold. ""Don't you dare.""

Then my husband looked at everyone watching us and said, ""She's been sleeping with my brother for months. I just caught them upstairs.""

The silence was deafening. My mother-in-law gasped and started crying. My kids were in the next room and heard everything.

""That's not what happened,"" I said desperately. ""He's drunk right now, can't you smell it on him?""

But my husband wasn't drunk. Everyone could see that. And my brother-in-law's guilt was written all over his face.

We left immediately. The drive home was silent except for my kids crying in the backseat.

It's been a week now. My husband moved out and is staying with a friend. He's filed for divorce and wants primary custody. His entire family has blocked me on everything. My mother-in-law, who used to call me her daughter, crossed the street when she saw me at the grocery store.

My kids barely speak to me. My 10-year-old asked me why I lied about daddy drinking. My 7-year-old keeps asking when daddy is coming home.

My own parents are disgusted with me. My dad said he raised me better than this. My mom won't even take my calls.

I lost my job because word spread around our small town. My brother-in-law moved to another state and won't return my texts.

I know I cheated and that was horrible. But my husband abandoned our marriage emotionally long before I found comfort elsewhere. And yes, I lied about the drinking, but I was cornered and panicking.

Was I really supposed to just stand there and let him humiliate me in front of his entire family?",1,1757001115.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

I convinced my husband to mortgage our house for a $75,000 wedding, then spent it all on trips with my boyfriend.

My husband and I had been together for eight years when I started pushing for this huge dream wedding. He kept saying we couldn't afford it, but I wore him down. I told him my sister got a $60,000 wedding and mine should be even better. I cried, I threatened to call off the engagement, the whole thing.

""We can't take out a second mortgage just for one day,"" he said. ""What if something happens to our jobs?""

""Nothing's going to happen,"" I told him. ""And this is important to me. Don't you want me to be happy?""

He finally agreed. We got approved for $75,000 against the house. The plan was to have this massive destination wedding in Hawaii with all our friends and family.

But here's the thing. I'd been seeing this guy from my yoga class for about three months when the money came through. Started as just texting, then meeting for coffee, then a full affair. He was everything my husband wasn't. Spontaneous, adventurous, always talking about these amazing places he'd traveled.

When that money hit our account, I looked at it and thought why should I spend this on one day when I could actually live my life? So I told my husband the wedding planner needed payments in cash for vendors. Totally believable since lots of Hawaii vendors work that way.

I took $15,000 for Bali with my boyfriend. Then $12,000 for a long weekend in Paris. Another $8,000 for this incredible week in Costa Rica. Each time I'd tell my husband it was wedding expenses. Flowers, photography, venue deposits.

""The wedding planner is being really demanding about these payments,"" I'd say when he questioned the amounts.

""This seems like a lot,"" he said after I claimed we needed another $10,000 for catering.

""Do you want a cheap wedding? Because I can call my friends right now and tell them it's canceled.""

He always backed down.

My boyfriend and I had this whole fantasy going. He kept talking about us running away together, starting fresh somewhere new. I was already mentally divorced, you know? In my head, my marriage was over and this was my new life beginning.

The affair continued for eighteen months total. I spent $65,000 on trips, gifts, and an expensive apartment I rented for us to meet at. My husband thought we were planning the wedding of the century.

Then my boyfriend got a job offer in Denver. I thought he'd ask me to come with him. Instead, he sat me down at our usual coffee place and said, ""Listen, I think we both know this has run its course. I'm looking for something more serious.""

More serious? I'd literally bankrupted my marriage for him.

Two weeks later, my husband found a bank statement I forgot to hide. He saw all the withdrawals, all the transfers to accounts he didn't recognize.

""What is this?"" he said, waving the papers. ""Where did our wedding money go?""

I panicked. I told him I'd invested it and lost everything in cryptocurrency. Obviously, he didn't believe me. He started digging deeper, found receipts from the trips, found texts on an old phone.

The fight was explosive. He called me every name in the book. Threatened divorce immediately. But I could see the hurt underneath all that anger. Eight years of his life, and I'd thrown it away for vacation photos.

That's when I decided to go on the offensive. I called his mom, my mom, my sister, anyone who would listen. I told them he'd been controlling our finances the whole time. That he'd forced me to account for every penny, that he'd been financially abusing me for years.

""He made me feel like I couldn't even buy groceries without permission,"" I sobbed to his sister. ""I was so scared of him finding out I'd spent money on anything for myself.""

People believed me initially. His own family started questioning him. My mom offered to pay for a lawyer.

But my husband hired a forensic accountant. Got copies of everything. Proved exactly where every dollar went, when, and what for. He had photos from my social media showing me in Bali, Paris, all these places I'd supposedly never been.

The divorce proceedings were brutal. I got nothing. The house had to be sold to pay off the second mortgage. I ended up with about $3,000 from our savings account and my car.

Here's the part that really stings. Once everyone saw the evidence, the same people who'd supported me through the ""financial abuse"" completely cut me off. His family obviously. But my own sister wouldn't even return my calls. My mom said she was ""disappointed in who I'd become.""

My ex-husband's lawyer had warned me during the divorce proceedings that any attempts to contact him or interfere with his life would result in legal action. I thought it was just lawyer talk, intimidation tactics. I should have listened.

I'd been living in my car for three weeks. Showering at the gym, eating fast food, sleeping in Walmart parking lots. My boyfriend, obviously, wanted nothing to do with me. My ex-husband had moved on and seemed genuinely happy from what I could see on social media.

I kept thinking about those trips though. They were incredible. I felt more alive during those eighteen months than I had in the entire eight years of my marriage.

 *For the sake of God, if you are writing your ICSE/ISC in the year 2026/2027, please immediately switch to a BLUE BALL PEN.*

**Reasons:**

* Gel/Fountain Pen has a high possibility of being smudged in the hurry of finishing your entire paper in 2-3 hours. Ball Pens are smudge proof, dry quickly and also makes your writing look clean to your checker.
* Ball Pens are lighter, easy to use and does not have any risks of being leaked while being in the exam hall. They last longer and don't get stuck much unless the ink is dried up or over.  Most competitive and govt exams also mandate ball pens, so why not practice with them now?
* Examiners often sip tea/coffee while checking ‚Äî a spill won‚Äôt ruin your script with ball pen ink. Out of hundreds of paper, if by any chance tea/coffee/water spills on your answer book, your ink won't flood on the paper and with a little care and drying, your writing remains intact and can be considered.
* BLUE BALL PEN looks really great and aesthetic, examiner-friendly on your Green Lined ICSE/ISC Answer book. Its more soothing to the eye of the examiner and doesn't look that messy if you cancel a few lines here and there (although never recommended). Even a little scribbling with Black Pen spoils the whole look of the examiner. Bad handwriting looks worse with black ink; blue ink is more forgiving

1n8dpev,https://i.redd.it/r4ldkn3i46nf1.jpeg,Found a bed bug on our couch,"Husband and I recently helped family out after an eviction, my mom and 2 of her grandkids. 

They moved in 2 months ago, and stayed in the basement, my nephew told me he had bug bites and claimed it was from dog hair/allergies or mosquito bites. I have never seen or had bed bugs or bites so I honestly didn‚Äôt know, but it did sound odd as they weren‚Äôt itchy and red around like mosquito bites and he was also NEVER outside. I told my husband who just ignored it so I figured it was allergies then. 
Due to safety concerns and CPS involvement for nephew and niece, my mom and nephew had to leave while they investigated. All of their stuff is still down in the basement.
My niece stayed with us during this time, and she slept in our living room on the couch. We originally had given her a towel, blanket and pillows for the couch, but she brought up 2-3 blankets and teddy bears from the basement for bedtime. This wasn‚Äôt a concern, only her blankets smelled like dog and left a lot of dog hair (I‚Äôm allergic) so I basically avoided the couch due to this issue, and because it‚Äôs summer I often wear shorts. Exposure to dog danger caused me to get hives, so as a precaution for myself I just didn‚Äôt sit on the couch instead id sit on the bean bag or the dining table that is adjacent to the couch. 

My niece was sleeping on this couch for just over 2 weeks, CPS closed the investigation and they moved back to the place that evicted them exactly a week ago today. I guess they just had to pay back a few months, i don‚Äôt know how this became an option. They asked us for money and I gave them around $200 and things like detergent, food, and paid her phone and brakes for her car. 

Last night I was doing homework on the dining table, and went to sit next to my husband on the couch for a minute. I saw a bug crawling on the side of the couch and freaked out, at first I thought it was a roach or something. Idk why, it was moving fairly fast and looked pretty big but had little like antenas or whatever. I had never seen a bedbug so I didn‚Äôt even think of that, it was my husband who said it looks like a bedbug. He googled it and sure enough it was a bedbug. He then told me his family had bedbugs when he was a kid and they had to throw everything away and move. I was freaking out because I had always heard how hard they are to get rid of, and how they lay dormant. 
Apparently it looked like it hadn‚Äôt fed in a while, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any bug bites. But I have 4 kids at home (11,8,4,&2) the younger 2 are ALWAYS in the living room. We have a toy chest and bins less than 6feet from the couch, and a rug that extends the whole living area. We have a wicker basket that holds things like teddy bears, blankets/throws, small pillows that are usually on the couch and where I‚Äôd put the bedding my niece used. I have it 3feet away from the carpet stairs that lead upstairs. They would play and make forts with the cushions and blankets while they were here, but more so the 2 weeks my niece was living in the living room. 

We were already going to throw the couch away as my niece also peed on it, we washed the cushion covers and swapped out the cushions around the living room to a less used couch especially as we washed the covers. Anyways I don‚Äôt know if I should remove the couch immediately, and have no couch. This seems better than having the constant exposure in the middle of our living room. 

I‚Äôm 6months pregnant and considered high risk for preterm birth, so i‚Äôm supposed to be limiting certain activities and keeping an eye on contractions (irritable uterus) when they are triggered, basically rest and hydrate. But I really want to move this couch out of my living room, get rid of the rug, clean and steam mop everything downstairs, bag all the toys and blankets then take them to like a laundromat to wash on high heat. I would have to do this on my own while the kids are at school, husband won‚Äôt have a day off until Sunday. And I‚Äôm the type of person to want to do all of this like NOW, instead of wait. I do have pest control coming over tomorrow for an inspection. But I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do, how quickly to act on this couch, the stuff in the basement (we had a whole little lounge area couch, rug, coffee table with storage inside, rug, cushion bench and another area that is like a little library with a rug, all the board games and books we have, giant teddy bear. And we also have boxes of just storage items like Christmas stuff, toys we swap out, clothes that we use as hand me downs for the girls, etc). My mom and the kids took about 75% of the basement including the little areas we mentioned and would sleep on the couch down there as well. 
I suggested we get a U-Haul and take all of their stuff to their place, they have not even mentioned when they wanted to pick up their stuff now have they came by to pick anything but a couple bags up. We could also load up the U-Haul with the couches and what we want to get rid of (rugs) and take them to the dump. But he can‚Äôt help me do that until Sunday his day off. 

We are upset and keep feeling like we get burned every time we try to help family out. Last time I tried to help my sister out we lost around $4k. I don‚Äôt know how much this is going to set us back. I was looking at a bug heater that‚Äôs around $1500, plus a new couch, the U-Haul and pest control fees to make sure this can be contained. But I also don‚Äôt know how far this infestation has gone. I‚Äôm worried that the bed bug eggs have gone upstairs with little kids and the constant moving, jumping and taking teddy bears and blankets up and down the stairs or outside. I don‚Äôt know what to expect at this point. 

It‚Äôs an open living room kitchen, dining area and living area is a big rectangle room. The basement is next to the garage door that enters into a small hallway before going into the kitchen. The main entrance is adjacent to the garage door but you come in and there‚Äôs a bathroom to the right, a hallway and carpeted stairs that go upstairs to our 3bedrooms. 


What would you advice me to do with the couch right now??? I can drag it out to the garage until we can move it Sunday. But will the steam mop be enough to kill the bugs on the floor? How about the baseboards. 
Just because none of us have shown bug bites yet when should or could we expect them if it‚Äôs actually went to our beds? I wish I could know wether they are confined to the basement and couch, but I‚Äôm worried that my toddlers have unintentionally spread them around the house.

I haven't cried in about two years. But today, standing barefoot in the kitchen, watching the dark liquid inch toward my toes, I wanted to. Not because I was sad, not really.

Hi (I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm posting this here, but because you guys know cats more than anyone. I‚Äôm in a desperate need for help),


A little background: My mom has a deep and long-standing phobia of cats. When she was a child, a cat scratched her so badly that she almost had her leg amputated. Since then, even the sight of one is deeply distressing for her.


The situation now: We recently moved into a ground-floor apartment with a small garden. There are stray cats (especially a kitten and another cat) visiting our garden quite frequently. They haven‚Äôt harmed anything, but they learnt to open our windows; we once caught one mid sneaking in. And now their presence is causing my mom significant anxiety. She‚Äôs barely leaving the apartment, keeps all windows closed, and is on constant edge.


We‚Äôre looking for humane, safe, and effective ideas to deter the cats or reduce their visits. I‚Äôve come across suggestions about using scents like coffee grounds, mint oil, or tea tree oil; but I‚Äôm not sure these actually work or are safe for both the cats and our plants.


So my questions/what I want advice on is:

1- Has anyone tried any of these scent-based methods (coffee grounds, mint, citrus peels, essential oils)? Did they work? Any tips on safe application?

2- Are there other humane strategies you‚Äôd recommend (I read about motion activated sprinklers but I can‚Äôt get them at the moment)?

3- Any product recommendations or DIY ideas that helped in similar situations?

4- For folks with a strong cat-related phobia‚Ä¶ what helped you feel calmer or more secure?

Using the Affresh W10355052 Coffee Maker Cleaner has been quite the experience in my household. Having multiple coffee aficionados under one roof, a cleaner compatible with both single-serve and multi-cup brewers has been a game-changer. This product claims to fight mineral buildup, descale coffee makers, and improve the overall coffee flavor. After putting it through its paces, I can see how it lives up to much of its promise. However, there are a few nuances I‚Äôll share that you might want to consider before trying it.

**Ease of Use**

I can‚Äôt stress enough how straightforward it was to use these cleaning tablets. There‚Äôs no messy measuring or stirring involved‚Äîjust drop a tablet into the reservoir, fill it with water, and run a brewing cycle. It‚Äôs so intuitive that even my caffeine-deprived morning brain could navigate the process without disaster. Plus, the lack of vinegary odor makes it infinitely more pleasant to use than traditional DIY cleaning methods. The whole ""drop and brew"" approach felt like a blessing, particularly for someone like me who loathes complicated maintenance routines.

Check [Affresh W10355052 Coffee Maker Cleaner](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b06x16s1hz/) price on Amazon.

**Performance and Effectiveness**

I tested the cleaning ability with both my drip coffee maker and my single-serve brewer, and the results were noticeable. After a single cycle, the machines seemed to run smoother, and I detected a remarkable improvement in the taste of my coffee. Mineral buildup had clearly been handled, thanks to the deep-cleaning formula. My single-serve pods also started working more efficiently; previously, I‚Äôd sometimes encounter clogged filters, but these issues all but disappeared. That said, while the Affresh tablets are highly effective on a maintenance schedule, older machines with significant buildup might require a second or even third round of cleaning.

**Compatibility Across Machines**

One of the main attractions of these tablets is their versatility. Whether you‚Äôre working with a single-serve system like the Keurig or a larger multi-cup drip coffee maker, the cleaner is designed to handle both with equal efficiency. My machines have entirely different designs, yet the cleaner worked seamlessly with both. This universal compatibility makes it appealing if your kitchen, like mine, includes a variety of brewing devices. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the product doesn't seem suitable for espresso makers, so those looking to clean specialized devices may need another option.

**Advantages**

- Compatible with both multi-cup brewers and single-serve machines.  
- Easy-to-use tablets; no mixing or measuring required.  
- No unpleasant vinegar smell during or after cleaning.  
- Helps improve coffee flavor by removing mineral buildup.  

**Drawbacks**

- May require repeat usage for heavily scaled machines.  
- Not compatible with espresso machines.  

**Build Quality and Packaging**

The tablets come neatly packed in a small, lightweight box, making storage simple. Each tablet is solidly constructed, and there was no crumbling or mess when handling them. They are also U.S. EPA Safer Choice Certified, which provided peace of mind about the safety of the ingredients. However, considering the size of the box, it might feel a tad insubstantial for households with multiple coffee machines or frequent users.

**Good Points**

I appreciated the fact that the Affresh cleaner eliminates the need for vinegar or harsh chemicals, both of which can leave lingering odors. The simplicity of the process and the improved taste of the coffee after cleaning were definite highlights for me. It also claims to prolong the life of coffee makers, which, if true, adds even more value.

**Areas for Improvement**

- A clearer indication of compatibility with other types of machines (beyond multi-cup and single-serve) would be ideal.  
- Including more than three tablets per pack would add long-term convenience.  

**Competing Products**

When I compared the Affresh cleaner to competing brands, such as the Keurig Descaling Solution and commercial vinegar cleaners, there were clear differences. The Affresh tablets were far easier to use than descaling liquids, which usually involve measuring and a risk of spills. While vinegar remains the budget-friendly competitor, it can‚Äôt compete with the odorless performance of these tablets. On the flip side, Keurig‚Äôs own cleaners might be better for users with exclusively Keurig systems, as they‚Äôre tailored for those machines, whereas Affresh is a more versatile choice.

**Cost Efficiency**

Though you only get three tablets in a pack, the functionality makes them worth considering. If used monthly, as recommended, this amounts to an affordable way to maintain kitchen equipment and improve coffee quality. In comparison to competitors, Affresh strikes a satisfying balance of affordability and high performance. While not the cheapest option out there, you can‚Äôt put a price on the hassle-free maintenance and consistent results.

My goal is to appeal to clients who value vintage masculine aesthetics: barber shops, antique shops, gaming shops, coffee shops, cigar shops, breweries, etc. I selected the font 'West End Decorate Shadow' for its old-timey yet kind of elegant look.

Due to my emphasis on using ink (printer and physical ink) for both visual and written communication, when coming up with iconography for my brand, I decided on the classic pen tool for its double-use of graphic design, and calligraphy, and cephalopods for their ability to produce ink. This lead to a kind of eldritch 'creature' mascot that I imagine would be used similar to [Clippy](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=7550878c098e0420&rls=en&sxsrf=AE3TifNpV3UdYEittPnhMjW6FoksjZjDlw:1756999108706&udm=2&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeuYzzFkfneXafNx6OMdA4MRo3L_oOc-1oJ7O1RV73dx3MIyCigtuiU2aDjExIvydX85cOq96-7Mxd4KSNCLhHwZjNl1D--59A3Pz1jRAtenzCJ-qzCnOKtvU69k0YYAuhlzxHSrRNQ-gtEYBj8xSow3FJ3v7l7zsi4eO0Nw9mEGcGVLxNQ&q=microsoft+office+clippy&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj30frds7-PAxXRGFkFHf07NbwQtKgLegQIFhAB&biw=1392&bih=552&dpr=2) (for those who remember that paper clip from early Microsoft).

1n8dagw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1n8dagw/explore_if_the_daixism_furniture_marker_kit/,Explore If the DAIXISM Furniture Marker Kit Really Fixes Scratches,"**Comprehensive Scratch Repair Kit**  
I‚Äôve spent the past few weeks putting the DAIXISM MR-21 scratch repair kit to the test, and it‚Äôs been surprisingly versatile. Wooden furniture and I have a love-hate relationship ‚Äì I adore the warmth it adds to my home, but scratches and nicks drive me nuts. With 21 pieces, including 10 touch-up markers, 10 wax sticks, and a sharpener, this kit seemed like the perfect solution for tackling the minor wear and tear that comes with wooden surfaces.

**Wide Range of Colors**  
The variety of colors in the kit didn‚Äôt disappoint. From white and gray to vibrant shades like cherry and mahogany, it was surprisingly easy to find a near-perfect match for different types of wood in my collection. Whether it was my oak dining table or the walnut trim on my bookshelves, the markers blended seamlessly ‚Äì it's like watching scratches vanish before your eyes. I even experimented on an old chestnut coffee table with deep gouges, and while the finish isn‚Äôt flawless, it‚Äôs a massive improvement.  

[Ready to buy DAIXISM MR-21? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://sanue.com/p/b09fz6d4sr/)

**Ease of Use**  
You don‚Äôt need to have any prior experience to use these markers. A quick pass over a scratch with a marker, buff it lightly, and voila ‚Äì the damage fades away. The wax sticks were a bit harder to master, though. Applying pressure while filling deeper dents was a workout for my hands. But it‚Äôs worth it because even stubborn imperfections get an ideal touch-up. Sometimes I‚Äôd oversaturate the marker, but a dab of an alcohol wipe quickly corrected that while keeping the stain in place within the scratch.

**Durability of Repairs**  
Once dried, the color held surprisingly well. I tested this on my dining table, notorious for daily abuse, and found the color didn‚Äôt fade even when wiped with a damp cloth. It‚Äôs perfect for high-traffic areas, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using abrasive cleaners directly on it as any varnished surface might still react negatively.

**Positives**  
‚Ä¢ Extensive color variety for matching different types of wood  
‚Ä¢ Quick drying formula saves tons of time  
‚Ä¢ Easy application ensures newbies can achieve great results  
‚Ä¢ Compact size and packaging for convenient storage  

**Critiques**  
‚Ä¢ Wax sticks require significant pressure to get optimal results  
‚Ä¢ Markers can sometimes oversaturate unless handled carefully  
‚Ä¢ Durability of repairs may suffer with constant exposure to harsh cleaners  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other scratch repair kits from competitors, I noticed a clear difference in performance. Some kits lean heavily towards markers alone, skipping wax for deeper fixes. DAIXISM stands out by including wax sticks, which add versatility for dents and holes, not just scratches. Other brands like Rejuvenate offer quality but fewer color options, making color matching far more challenging. The markers in the DAIXISM kit also seem to blend better, especially in older furniture with varied tones. The only competitor that could rival this would include better tools for wax application like small scrapers or blending brushes, which I found missing here.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Judging by the range of colors, repair quality, and overall ease of application, this kit offers decent value for its features. I‚Äôve used furniture pens in the past that were slightly cheaper, but they lacked the premium finish and durability this set provides. The inclusion of both markers and wax really helps justify the price point, making it a smart purchase for touching up various types of wood furniture. Whether you‚Äôre a DIY enthusiast or someone like me who just likes their furniture to not look battered all the time, it feels like money well spent.

1n8dac7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1n8dac7/reveal_if_the_best_wireless_headset_jabra_evolve/,Reveal if the best wireless headset Jabra Evolve 65 lives up,"Jabra Evolve 65 MS Wireless Stereo Headset has been my go-to for work and casual use over the past few weeks, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an interesting ride. This isn‚Äôt just another pair of headphones‚Äîit‚Äôs built around professional-grade noise-canceling technology paired with wireless freedom. Sleek, lightweight, and designed specifically for productivity, this device is tailored for people who demand both clear communication and immersive audio. Having put it through its paces in multiple situations, I uncovered both its strengths and limitations that are worth sharing.

**Performance and Sound Quality**  
Audio quality often makes or breaks a headset for me, and this product delivers on most fronts. Its dynamic drivers ensure the sound is both crisp and balanced. Whether I was on a conference call or streaming my favorite playlist, clarity stood out. During work meetings, the noise-canceling microphone picked up my voice cleanly, filtering out background clatter from my barking dog and an occasional noisy neighbor. This seamless performance impressed my colleagues, who noticed an improvement in call quality on their end. However, I found the passive noise cancellation to be just that‚Äîpassive. It‚Äôs decent but doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to more aggressive, active noise-canceling options.

**Comfort and Design**  
The over-ear shape paired with leatherette cushions is a win for long-term comfort. I often wear headsets for hours at a time, and this one didn‚Äôt leave me reaching for ibuprofen. Despite being lightweight (just 11.7 ounces), the headset feels durable. Honestly, the integrated busy light is a genius touch, offering a subtle yet effective way to signal ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù to those around you. That said, the boom arm design for the microphone feels a bit outdated compared to sleeker alternatives I‚Äôve seen recently.

[Check Jabra Evolve 65 MS Wireless Stereo Headset price on Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b08kjq9jw9/)  

**Ease of Connectivity**  
With Bluetooth, NFC, and USB options, connecting the headset was always hassle-free, even when switching between devices like my laptop, phone, and tablet. I particularly liked that dual connectivity worked seamlessly, allowing me to take calls on my smartphone and then switch instantly to a Zoom call on my laptop. Having a wireless range of up to 100 meters felt liberating‚ÄîI can head to the kitchen to grab a coffee mid-meeting without worrying about audio loss. On the downside, Bluetooth 3.0 feels dated. With so many products in the market leveraging newer Bluetooth versions, I wish this model kept up with the evolving tech.

**All-Day Battery Performance**  
Battery life is where I have mixed feelings. The promised 14 hours of talk time generally held true, even during my busiest days. It‚Äôs a lifesaver during back-to-back calls, and charging while in use via USB was a convenient fallback. However, the nearly 14-hour charge time feels a bit excessive compared to comparable models that charge quicker. This isn‚Äôt an ideal situation when you forget to plug it in the night before. 

**Key Benefits**  
‚Ä¢ Lightweight and comfortable design ensures all-day wearability.  
‚Ä¢ Crystal-clear audio, propelling sound quality most would envy.  
‚Ä¢ Built-in busy light minimizes interruptions in shared spaces.  

**Limitations**  
‚Ä¢ Lacks modern active noise cancellation many users might expect.  
‚Ä¢ Bluetooth 3.0 feels underwhelming in today‚Äôs wireless landscape.  
‚Ä¢ Charging time could be faster, given the competition.

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this headset to competing products like the Bose 700 and Plantronics Voyager, the offerings diverge based on priorities. Bose‚Äôs lineup surpasses this Jabra model with high-performing active noise cancellation and more immersive sound for music lovers. Plantronics Voyager scores marginally higher with newer Bluetooth capabilities and a slightly more refined microphone design that fits modern workspaces better. Jabra holds strong, though, with its price-to-quality ratio, versatile connectivity options, and ease of transitioning between devices. In terms of sheer professional practicality, the Evolve 65 MS excels, but audio enthusiasts might gravitate toward its competitors.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For professionals like myself who value functionality over frills, this headset delivers what it promises at a justifiable cost. Its productivity-focused features like the busy light, combined headset controls, and Microsoft Lync certification, ensure that you‚Äôre getting good value. Though some aspects lag behind, like its older Bluetooth version and limited noise cancellation options, the product holds its ground in a crowded market. If budget matters and high-stakes audio performance isn‚Äôt a deal-breaker, this is worth your consideration.

1n8dac6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1n8dac6/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_combo_ninja_cfp301/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Combo Ninja CFP301 Worth It or Not,"The Ninja CFP301 DualBrew Pro Specialty Coffee Maker has been my go-to device for the past couple of months, and let me tell you, it really stands out in the crowded world of coffee machines. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a single coffee maker to handle drip coffee, K-Cups, iced coffee, and specialty brews with such ease, but this little powerhouse impressed me on multiple fronts. Whether you‚Äôre an occasional coffee drinker or someone like me who thrives on caffeine, this machine offers a ton of versatility‚Äîand yes, a learning curve or two to boot.

**Design that Blends Function with Style**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this coffee maker was its sleek black design and compact dimensions (9.13"" depth, 11.39"" width, 15.54"" height). It looked perfect for a modern kitchen setup without taking up excessive counter space. An interesting feature is the multi-position water reservoir. It can be repositioned to the rear or side of the machine, depending on your countertop arrangement, which I found super handy since my kitchen has limited space. The fold-away frother is another neat touch, as it stays tucked away when not in use. While the overall design is appealing, the machine does feel slightly heavy at just under 10 pounds, so moving it around may not be ideal for everyone.

**Easy-to-Use Versatility**  
Using this machine is as simple as pushing a button‚Äîand yet somehow fascinatingly complex because of everything it can do. It offers four brew styles: Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty. One morning I brewed a Classic large travel mug of coffee for my commute, while the other day, I used the Specialty setting to make a rich espresso-like concentrate, perfect for a homemade latte. On weekends, I enjoy a refreshing iced coffee, utilizing the Over Ice setting.

What really blew my mind, however, was the capability of brewing both grounds and pods. This coffee maker comes with a K-Cup pod adapter as well as the ability to handle five grounds sizes (small cup to full carafe) and four pod brew sizes (6-12 oz). While I usually prefer grinding fresh beans, the convenience of popping in a K-Cup shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated on busy mornings.

[Want the lowest Ninja CFP301 price? Click Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b08qzsn97z/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
Speed and flavor are everything when it comes to coffee makers, and this machine doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Surprisingly, it brews a pod faster than some leading Keurig models I‚Äôve used before. Even better, the built-in Thermal Flavor Extraction DUO technology ensures the coffee is both flavorful and aromatic every time. The independent hot water system is another standout feature, as it can dispense either hot or boiling water. I‚Äôve used it to make tea, hot chocolate for my kids, and even instant oatmeal on a rushed morning.

Still, I noticed that the separate hot water system might be slightly slower than expected, especially when set to its boiling mode. It‚Äôs not a huge issue, but if you‚Äôre expecting instant results, there might be a slight delay.

**Strengths**  
‚Ä¢ The fold-away frother works beautifully, turning both hot and cold milk or milk alternatives into creamy froth effortlessly.  
‚Ä¢ The removable 60-oz reservoir is easy to clean and refill.  
‚Ä¢ Multiple brew size options cater to all preferences, including single-serve and large households.  
‚Ä¢ Thermal Flavor Extraction ensures fantastic taste across various coffee styles.  

**Critiques**  
‚Ä¢ At 15.54"" tall, it‚Äôs a bit tricky to place on countertops with low-hanging cupboards.  
‚Ä¢ Some users might find the weight inconvenient for repositioning the machine.  
‚Ä¢ While versatile, the number of settings can feel overwhelming to beginners, requiring a bit of trial and error.  

**Competing Products**  
If you‚Äôre considering alternatives, Keurig models like the K-Elite and K-Supreme are significant competitors. Keurig machines generally have a more straightforward interface, and they shine in the speed of pod brewing. However, the Ninja CFP301 not only surpasses Keurig in its ability to brew grounds but also offers a better extract flavor for coffee purists. Another contender might be the Breville Barista Express, which focuses more on crafting espresso beverages. Yet, the Ninja feels more versatile because of its multiple settings, including options for tea, iced coffee, and hot water.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Investing in this machine might require some thought, but I genuinely believe it offers excellent value for price. Think about it: a drip coffee machine, iced coffee maker, and specialty coffee brewer combined with a frother and K-Cup compatibility‚Äîall in one unit. While you could buy separate gadgets to cover these features, one multi-purpose machine like this saves both money and counter space in the long run.

1n8da62,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1n8da62/advice_for_undergrad_interested_in_cs_research/,Advice for Undergrad interested in CS research,"Hi all, 

I wanted to share a few words of wisdom for undergrad in cs who want to break into ai or cs research. **Disclaimer:** I am not a recruiter or an expert just sharing a few lessons I learned cause I wished someone told me sth like this earlier.

First thing you need serious research experience. Reach out to your professors for research assistantships. And please make sure what you are doing is not just cleaning datasets. That will likely be the first step but dont just stop there. If you really know you want to do research, start understanding the technical side of the project. Read relevant papers and contribute to group conversations. Dont just be the undergrad seating in the room. Get out of your comfort zone and ask even if those are dumb questions. People say getting into a lab is hard but honestly I think it is not as bad as landing a tech job in this economy.

Most of the time cold emailing professors doesnt work since they get tons of emails from self called motivated undergrads and they are likely to ignore you. Instead find classes they teach and talk to them after class. You dont even have to be their student. In person makes a difference. Also try to get publications. Now with ai even undergrads are publishing in top conferences. Make sure you get your name on papers cause the competition is rising fast.

Second be sure you really want to do research. I started research my freshman winter. Last summer I got two offers one for Microsoft Undergrad Researcher and another for a big tech swe. I followed the norm and took the swe role but I ended up not liking it. It was not intellectually stimulating like I was doing cool things but not at the frontiers of people pushing the limits of what ai can do or at least not contributing new knowledge or challenging assumptions that always fullfil me in research. So I don't think industry swe is meant for me. So make sure you actually like research and if you do then go all in.

Hard truth: most research roles are for phd students and you are likely to not get anything. So if you want to be competitive you should not give a hard NO to grad school. There are tons of phd bounds who will be competing with you so go into research as if you want to get into a top grad school and grind. You can still recruit for swe and honestly leetcode somehow becomes easier this way. After reading lots of challenging papers I think my intuition improved. Hard things always expand ur horizons.

With that in mind my profile is now a little bit like an early phd even though I am a junior. How did I do that? I took grad level courses as a sophomore and now as a junior. These courses give you a voice. You won't take DSA or intro programming or discrete math and join a lab and call yourself a researcher. Challenge yourself and ask professors to let you into those classes. That's the first step.

Profile: junior (as of junior fall) in 3 labs all with peer reviewed publications in process (1 first author) taken 5 graduate level courses. Read at least 1 top conference papers a week. 

I go to an ivy league but that was never a ticket. I worked my ass off and still do. Getting into labs meant reading what professors were doing, taking their classes and asking hard questions about their papers. It meant reading actual ML NLP CV papers and understanding the research game not just thinking ai is calling an OpenAI API. Competing with masters students meant doing extra for professors to see I was not just like other undergrads hyped about research for the sake of it. I even emailed researchers at Google Deepmind after reading their papers to challenge some assumptions and never once said I go to this school. Just my questions. Some even gave me coffee chats to talk more because every researcher likes when someone reads and challenges their work. If you can engage with them you will lock it. So while my school helped I grinded.¬† And no matter what school you go to you can too.

With features like dual control panels, six browning settings, and compatibility with various bread types, it sounded like the perfect addition to my breakfast routine. I‚Äôve been using it daily for the past three weeks, experimenting with everything from bagels to waffles, and here‚Äôs how it performed.

**Design and Build Quality**

This toaster‚Äôs aesthetic is nothing short of impressive, boasting a brushed stainless-steel finish that complements modern kitchen decor. Its touch screen control adds a futuristic element, making it a centerpiece on my countertop. It‚Äôs compact yet heavy enough to stay stable, and I appreciated the attention to detail, like the non-stick slots and removable crumb tray. This makes cleaning straightforward, even for lazy mornings when I‚Äôm rushing out the door. However, despite its overall sturdy construction, stainless steel tends to attract smudges, which can make it look less pristine over time.

**User Interface and Touch Screen Controls**

The highlight for me is clearly its intuitive touch screen. Two large 4.4-inch panels with bright, clear icons made it easy for my bleary morning self to pick the right options. Navigating the settings felt smooth, and the visual feedback‚Äîlike the countdown timer‚Äîhelped me keep track while multitasking, like brewing coffee. That said, the touchscreen can get a little finicky if your hands are damp or greasy, which happened more than once while I was prepping breakfast.

**Performance and Toasting Results**

I tested the toaster on every setting, from light browning to full-on crispy, and its consistency blew me away. The even toasting claims held true; slices came out golden and uniformly toasted every single time. Bagels toasted on the bagel setting had the perfect soft interior with crispy edges, while options like defrost mode impressed me when handling frozen waffles. Dual control panels are a genuine game-changer, especially in my household, where preferences vary wildly. On one side, I could toast a waffle to perfection, while on the other, a lightly browned slice of gluten-free bread. However, the heating time, especially on higher settings, wasn‚Äôt exactly fast‚Äîbetter time management is key.

[Check Mecity T-88A price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cg5p9hx5/)

**Flexibility and Versatility**

One of my favorite features is its compatibility with different bread types. The wide slots comfortably accommodate thick slices, bagels, and even artisan bread without difficulty. Six browning levels and three programmed modes (standard, bagel, and defrost) let me customize toasting to my exact specifications. Whether I wanted crispy English muffins or softly warmed croissants, the toaster delivered without a hitch. That said, I would have loved an option for reheating without additional browning, as some other models I‚Äôve used incorporate such a feature.

**Highlights**

- Dual control panels for customized toasting on separate sides.  
- Wide slots are perfect for bagels, artisan bread, and muffins.  
- Consistently even toasting with six adjustable browning settings.  
- Touchscreen interface is easy to use and visually sleek.

**Flaws**

- Touchscreen can be unresponsive when hands are damp or greasy.  
- Stainless steel finish shows smudges and fingerprints easily.  
- Toasting on higher settings takes longer than expected.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning this toaster turned out to be far less of a hassle than others I‚Äôve owned. The removable crumb tray slides in and out effortlessly, catching even the tiniest crumbs. Since the slots are made of non-stick and food-grade stainless steel, no burnt bread residue stuck inside, which was a relief. I timed myself at the end of the week, and it took under five minutes to wipe down the exterior and empty the crumb tray. However, I did notice that smudges on the metallic surface required a bit more elbow grease to keep it spotless.

**Peer Products**

Comparing it to other contemporary toasters like the Breville Die-Cast Smart Toaster or the Cuisinart CPT-620, the Mecity T-88A holds its ground. The dual controls and comprehensive touch screen set it apart in terms of tech-savviness, while competitors‚Äô dials and buttons lag behind in precision. However, the Breville offers a ‚ÄúLift and Look‚Äù option that lets you peek at your toast mid-cycle‚Äîsomething the Mecity lacks. Both competitors are also slightly faster on higher settings, making them more suited for people in a hurry, but they‚Äôre priced higher too, which nudges the Mecity ahead for budget-conscious tech lovers.

**Price Performance**

For its features, such as the dual panels, touch screen, and compatibility with every bread variety under the sun, this toaster provides a lot of bang for the buck. Though prices fluctuate, it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre getting advanced heating tech, smart design, and customization typically found in pricier models. If premium features are a priority, this toaster won‚Äôt disappoint, though the cleaning upkeep and minor improvements could elevate its standing further.

1n8d9a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n8d9a8/could_the_cuisinart_ss16w_coffee_maker_truly/,Could the Cuisinart SS-16W coffee maker truly transform your daily brew routine? Review inside!,"Testing the Cuisinart SS-16W 12-Cup Coffee Maker became a routine part of my mornings, turning an ordinary coffee ritual into a tailored experience. This versatile machine combines a drip coffee maker and a single-serve brewer, making it ideal for families or individuals with differing caffeine needs. Whether I was brewing a full 12-cup carafe on a busy morning or preparing a quick 4-ounce espresso to power through work, the product delivered excellent performance. However, despite the satisfaction it brought, there were a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**

The coffee maker‚Äôs sleek white finish and stainless-steel accents add a modern touch to any kitchen. Its compact design belies its generous coffee-brewing capacity, easily fitting on my countertop without devouring all the space. The carafe felt sturdy, and the stainless-steel handle gave a premium vibe. Its intuitive button layout made operation straightforward, even for someone who hasn‚Äôt had their coffee yet. The only hiccup was the removable water reservoir‚Äîit‚Äôs practical but a bit finicky to reattach at times after cleaning.

**Brewing Flexibility**

Many coffee makers lean into either single-serve pods or full carafe options, but here‚Äôs where this machine shines. Its two-in-one brewing feature bridges the divide. I tested the single-serve pod compatibility with various brands, including Keurig K-Cups, and found no issues. With the optional HomeBarista reusable filter, I could even use my favorite ground coffee. Brewing over ice was an unexpected bonus, offering a refreshing iced coffee to combat midday sluggishness.

**Speed and Temperature Control**

Cuisinart‚Äôs Extreme Brew technology claimed to brew coffee up to 25% faster, and I can vouch for that speed. Compared to my previous coffee maker, this unit shaves minutes off the brewing process, which is invaluable during a hectic morning. I particularly appreciated the option to adjust the carafe water temperature, ensuring my cup was neither lukewarm nor scalding. The brew-pause option came in handy when I couldn‚Äôt wait for the full carafe to finish, though I noticed it sometimes dripped just a little during the pause.

**Advantages**

- The dual functionality simplifies coffee brewing for households with varied preferences.
- Adjustable water temperature guarantees a great cup tailored to individual taste.
- Extreme Brew feature speeds up preparation‚Äîperfect for rushed mornings.
- The inclusion of a reusable filter minimizes waste and makes brewing more eco-conscious.  

**Drawbacks**

- Reattaching the water reservoir after cleaning can demand more effort than expected.
- The single-serve side sometimes splashes slightly on smaller mugs, requiring extra cleanup.
- Despite its premium build, the machine feels bulky in smaller kitchens.  

**User Convenience**

The 24-hour advanced start timer transformed how I planned my mornings. Setting the coffee maker the night before meant waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, which was honestly a mood-lifter. The self-cleaning feature kept maintenance minimal, though the manual cleaning for parts like the carafe and reservoir was still needed.

**Competing Brands**

When comparing this machine to other options like the Keurig K-Elite or Ninja DualBrew Pro, a few differences stand out. Unlike the Keurig K-Elite, which focuses solely on pods, the Cuisinart provides added versatility with its carafe feature. On the other hand, the Ninja DualBrew surpasses it in terms of brewing strength and specialty drink capabilities, making it better suited to adventurous coffee enthusiasts. What the Cuisinart gets right is balancing flexibility and affordability, positioning itself as a mid-range all-rounder. However, serious espresso aficionados might find the Ninja a better fit.

**Bang for the Buck**

Is this coffee maker worth its price tag? The extensive versatility, durable build, and advanced brewing options certainly validate its value if you like combining efficiency with quality. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest pick, it sits comfortably in the mid-range spectrum and offers plenty for those who appreciate coffee brewed their way. It might not serve hardcore espresso drinkers or small-space dwellers as effectively, but for households or offices with varied coffee preferences, it‚Äôs a great investment.

A Bit More About Me


I‚Äôm all about storytelling‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I‚Äôve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas‚Äîand there‚Äôs still plenty more I‚Äôd love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I‚Äôm the kind of person who notices the little things‚Äîyour favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it‚Äôs building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

	‚Ä¢	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	‚Ä¢	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	‚Ä¢	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	‚Ä¢	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I‚Äôm open to friendship, flirtation, or something more‚Äîwhatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds‚Äîall are welcome. I‚Äôm attracted to all body types‚Äîconnection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.

My friend and I entered the classroom without a lesson plan. We simply wanted to interact with the students and teach them something along the way.


We spent about 40 minutes there, not a lot of time, but enough for me to notice a particular child the moment I stepped in. He seemed to be on the autism spectrum, yet he was full of excitement and energy. He sat at the back with his friend, who was probably his best buddy.


My friend and I took turns teaching. As soon as I finished my part, I went straight to him, sat right in front of him, and started a conversation. And wow, he was genuinely happy. I could feel his excitement instantly. Even though it was just a short exchange since I was busy, I felt as though he was being truly heard for the first time.


I asked him a few simple, personal questions like where he lived, and even turned to ask his friend who was sitting beside him. But who answered? He did, with so much eagerness. He was so excited, and in that moment, I learned something valuable.


You should reach out to such kids and talk to them too. They are incredibly pure, and once you bond with them, you will become their favorite brother or sister.


I have had many such interactions before. I love talking with kids, and they enjoy talking with me just as much. These children are very sweet, and sometimes they even become reluctant to leave me.

1n8d6dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1n8d6dj/i_got_bitch_roommates_or_am_i_a_bitch/,I got bitch roommates or am I a bitch?,"So I recently shifted to Delhi , 1 August , gargi college, and before shifting to Delhi I thought of taking a two sharing room , but when I came here all the pgs in the proximity of 5-10 min , all 2 seater rooms were full and my parents wanted for one sem 1 that my pg should be near my college as it is the first time I have stepped out from my home town . So we chose a 4 sharing room ( which costed 20k per month) initially I found everything alright my roommates ( 2 are twins and one girl is from odisha ) were sweet and friendly. I thought I am lucky to have such friendly environment because shifting to another city from hometown takes a toll on ur mental health, many times I get homesick. Now the thing is firstly the three got along very well ( in habits they are like each other ), which I thought was sweet as there should be coordination between the roommates to have a good environment . 

Around 15 of August the problem started when everyone's classes started , they used to sleep early around 11 and wake early around 4-5 and I am totally opposite of them ( I literally always tried but was never successful in waking up early ) , I wake around 8-9 and sleep around 1-2 and I offered my roommates to keep the lights on till 12 atleast but they said they get problem in sleeping in light ( which they denied in starting), so for next one week I tried to shift my timetable but that didn't work out so I ordered a lamp for myself. Once they were turning off the lights around 10 when I objected I got a lecture about adjustment in pg life from 3 of them .They all wake around 4:45-5 and make coffee and talk for while and study around 6 , now the point is that ,this always wakes me up for while like 30-40 mins and today they were talking so loud that I had to tell them how irritating it is and I got again lecture about adjustment.

 Around 20 August they all three got sick together and it was only me taking care of them , I always brought them food and medicines and always helped three of them in every possible chore for one week , and for 2 days I slept in other room bcs they did not even turn on the fan . Next week I got really sick, I did everything on my own and they had the audacity while I was suffering from severe cold and viral fever , to ask to turn on ac ( which I declined for 3 days ) . I should tell u I never do anything to disturb them, I always move to balcony if I had any call ( even if my parents call ) and always wear headphones while watching something. But they all talk in room on call with their friends.  

Now the girl from odisha who always talk while smiling, is a potterhead , they all three watch Harry Potter together ( I have already seen the movie so I don't join them ) this always disturbs me , I even acknowledged it in front of them but I got lecture about adjustment. Yesterday they planned to see the part 4. I told them that pls tell me already when u all will watch I will do non imp things at that time bcs , the sound of movie hampers my study always. They said they will watch around 1:30 pm I agreed , so around 2 I asked them aren't u all watching the movie , they told no we are sleepy, I said alright watch around 3:30-5:30 as I will be in college and I won't even get disturbed. They said no ,  we will study around that time, we will watch around 9 ( mind u as wake late in morning night is the main time I study ) so the girl from odisha said this mainly and I told her firmly ( not even harsh tone ) that no u can't watch at that time I will be studying , watch it tomorrow not today . She got offended and told me that u can't say me like this , mujhse koi aise baat nhi karta , even my father don't deny me anything and all. I then apologized to her for my tone ( mind u that wasn't rude ), even sent a sweet a message on WhatsApp about how I would be careful from next about my tone . When I was in college I saw she replied ( it's ok I am okay , aap classes attend Karo aaram se with a pink heart ) I thought everything is sorted 

But when I came back , I saw my room was empty, they all weren't there and the message she replied with was deleted. Now since they came back I don't know from where , none of them is talking to me , they are ignoring me , the girl to whom I said that , have kept back the keychain I gifted her ,on my bed. Now tell me where am I at fault. This groupism was there since half a month,I felt fomo but I never said anything . There are many instances where there had been clash and when I asked for something I got lecture about adjustment and they haven't adjusted at all till now . They are good person ( we all share stuff and are never jealous of each other) but these things bother me Firstly I thought I am wrong and I should have patience but now it's getting over the top. 

Yall tell me what should I do , I have cried twice since morning and missing my home a lot . Sorry for my bad english or grammar mistakes because I am overwhelmed a lot ",1,1756999392.0,TeenIndia,3,1.0,False
1n8d5jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1n8d5jf/should_you_trust_the_oxiclean_stain_remover_pen/,Should You Trust the OxiClean Stain Remover Pen for Travel Mishaps,"I recently tried the OxiClean On The Go Stain Remover Pen, and as someone who constantly battles stains, this little tool quickly became a regular part of my routine. I mean, life gets messy‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs spilling coffee on a new blouse during a busy morning or discovering a chocolate stain on your kid's school uniform right before heading out the door. The OxiClean stain-removing pen has proven to be a lifesaver. The convenience of such a compact pen combined with the trademark stain-fighting power of OxiClean made me wonder why I hadn‚Äôt tried it earlier.

**Convenience on the Go**  
The compact size of this stain remover is genius. It fits easily in my handbag, gym bag, or even the glove compartment of my car. I like the fact that whenever life throws an unexpected stain at me‚Äîlike makeup smudges or spaghetti splatter‚ÄîI‚Äôm ready to tackle it immediately. It‚Äôs perfect for people like me who hate walking around with food mess or drink stains marking up their clothes.

**Effectiveness on Common Stains**  
From coffee to lipstick to soy sauce, this pen has handled a variety of stains. The manufacturer calls out its ability to combat tough ones such as chocolate and cosmetics, and they're not exaggerating. I personally tried it on a stubborn spaghetti sauce mark on my dress, and within a couple of minutes of rubbing the solution into the fabric, the stain disappeared like magic. The oxygen-powered formula seems to work especially well on fresh stains, which is a significant plus for anyone dealing with clumsiness like me.

[Check OxiClean On The Go Stain Remover Pen price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b09fhcxg6g/)

**Ease of Use**  
One of my favorite things about this stain remover pen is how simple it is to use. Just remove the cap, give the pen a gentle squeeze, and start rubbing the applicator against the fabric. Unlike some other stain solutions I‚Äôve tried, it doesn‚Äôt require rinsing or blotting with water afterward. You just let it dry on the garment, which is super practical when you‚Äôre out and about.

**Highlights**  
- Portable and travel-sized  
- Effective on a range of stains like food, drink, and cosmetics  
- Easy-to-use application without water  
- Formulated with oxygen power for tough stains  

**Areas for Concern**  
- It works best on fresh stains, but on set-in or older stains, the results can vary; it hasn‚Äôt been as effective if I missed tending to a stain right away.  
- The pen runs out faster than I‚Äôd like, especially if I‚Äôm tackling multiple stains in one day.  
- It‚Äôs not suitable for all fabric types‚Äîdelicate fabrics like silk might not respond well to the formula. Always spot-test first!  

**Competing Products**  
While the OxiClean stain remover pen works well on the go, it faces stiff competition from similar products like the Tide To Go pen and the Clorox Bleach Pen. The Tide variant matches OxiClean's portability but doesn‚Äôt seem to be as effective on non-food stains such as makeup. On the other hand, the Clorox pen offers an edge when dealing with heavier-duty cleaning, like outdoor upholstery, though it‚Äôs harsher on delicate fabrics. Where OxiClean strikes a balance is its versatility. I‚Äôve also noticed it doesn‚Äôt have a strong chemical smell, which I appreciate compared to its competitors.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
In terms of cost, the OxiClean pen is reasonably priced for the convenience and effectiveness it offers. Competing brands might be slightly cheaper or more expensive depending on the purchase platform, but I found this product to deliver a good balance of affordability and functionality. The additional bonus size adds value, ensuring you get a little more use compared to other similar products.

I don't see many reviews/opinions on that fragrance yet so I thought it may be a good idea to share mine. I got my hands on a 5ml sample cause while the notes speak to me as a Gourmand lover, some people were very disappointed and talked about it being overly ""synthetic"" and ""sour"" like yoghurt. y'all, I was so scared when I first sprayed it, but after my first smell I was absolutely FLOORED. I really have to start questioning some people's noses cause this fragrance is STUNNING! It's not a photorealistic cake but rather a scenery that is getting painted here imo. Imagine you step into a very nice coffee shop. they have all the nice cakes and cookies, and the smell of fresh coffee lingers in the air. you smell something slightly woody and comforting when you see the nice lounge chairs with the red velvet cushions, but it's just in the back and never gets overpowering. you get yourself a nice home made berry pound cake with a glass of warm milk. that's what I imagine when I smell this. It's definitely for the sweet tooths, it's smooth and delicious but not juvenile at all. of course it's as synthetic as a gourmand fragrance gets, you can't distill a CAKE into perfume oil, shocker I know, but it's not harsh or screechy at all. I already see myself wearing this to no end, I'm obsessed.

* *Claude Herald Markus, Co-Founder of Geyus Markus Holdings (GMH)*

The selling point of the Silver Gardens neighborhood during its inception and initial construction was simple: a piece of Vargos so enveloped by organic material that its architecture and infrastructure could proactively adapt to new stimuli, so easily that manual construction would cease to have a purpose. Why construct a city that could grow on its own? Of course, like many of the projects of Vargos‚Äô initial corporate founders, it devolved into a grime-ridden quagmire deemed unfit by shareholders as soon as it ran into the slightest setback. And so Silver Gardens, over time, became a home for the organic material interspersed through its sidewalks, streetlamps, and building facades, while becoming unfit for human habitation. But it was in Silver Gardens that corporate military contractors, street runners, wraiths, and even rogue AIs never dared tread. Only the worst of Vargos‚Äô criminal enterprises made it their home, enterprises like Teffer Plastics, whose only business was the procurement and sale of human organs, a reprehensible business in which things were grown without the harms so often associated with the perfectly legal cybernetic trade.

Two cylinders large enough to fit an adult, thirty operating tables for harvesting needs, and over one thousand lab-grown organs made up the whole of Freddy Gates‚Äô world. He awoke every morning in the sub-basement level of the surprisingly small warehouse built on the edge of Downtown and the Silver Gardens district, a section of the metropolis of Vargos once touted as a sample of what a city could be in the future. Freddy awoke in a room under constant siege from water leaks, mutating plant matter, and prickling vines that pushed through the concrete foundation and steel walls with such force it was never clear how long Teffer Plastics could maintain the business and keep Freddy employed.

He awoke that Monday morning without much thought on the day ahead. Freddy lived simply in the modest crack he‚Äôd dug for himself in the tapestry of Vargos: he awoke each morning at 6:00 a.m., whereupon he checked all Queue Cylinders for the healthy development of the host bodies inside: human bodies generated from a single cell, now home to several copies of organs, packed into bloated forms sustained by machines and Yongheng fluid, a byproduct of Quang Xi‚ÄìBlackfoot‚Äôs obscure food-development process. Then came 10:00 a.m., when Freddy cleaned every one of the thirty operating tables to meet the strict hygiene standards laid out by Vargos‚Äô city code for the operation of medical facilities; indeed, a rigorous standard for a place of business that would be shut down merely for peddling in a trade the Violet Board of Shareholders had outlawed in the city‚Äôs first ten years. Then came 3:00 p.m., when diagnostic checks had to be run on the thousands of containment units holding various organs destined for people with a precise combination of financial resources and uncompromising need, followed by a quick spot check of containers at 4:00 p.m.

4:00 p.m.

That strike on the clock marked the first moment Freddy heard it. Smooth, delicate words drifted into his ears as if they were hungry babes in need of a mother‚Äôs milk.

‚ÄúSee me.‚Äù

Freddy‚Äôs ears perked up fast as lightning. He was always alone in the warehouse unless management had scheduled a pickup day for containers or an emergency procedure. But no doors had opened. No intercom had gone off. No call had come through. Freddy was alone.

‚ÄúSee me.‚Äù

He turned this time as he walked through the rows of containers, straining to pick up the source of the noise. Jar A379-K: nothing in it, just loose tissue samples suspended in Yongheng. Jar 77HY-T: nothing in it, only the remains of old bone scrap used to graft samples. Jar 99RL-B: a loose, floating sample of skin suspended in Yongheng. Its sudden presence in Freddy‚Äôs field of vision was accompanied by an orchestra of high rings in his ears as he stared into the jar. He felt its warm, slippery voice pressing into his cranium, his eyes unblinking as he focused on the suspended scrap of tissue in the viscous green liquid.

‚ÄúStitch‚Ä¶see‚Ä¶aggregate.‚Äù

Freddy awoke the next morning drenched in cold sweat. The ever-present air conditioning, meant to keep the body parts at an optimal temperature, nearly stung him into shock as he noticed his thin blanket and pillow had been tossed from the cot onto the filthy floor. He stumbled upright, not bothering to make the bed, and moved from his modest room to the main floor of the complex as quickly as he could, arriving at the jar from the night before. He could hardly remember a thing, but he remembered the container: Jar 99RL-B.

Freddy approached the jar but felt no change. No voice. No ringing in his ears. No wetness in his mind, as if muck plastered to each passing thought. He inspected the fluid. It was as opaque as usual, but now lacked any trace of a tissue sample or grown organ, unlike the rest of the jars. Its emptiness at first caused confusion, then spiked his anxiety as Freddy realized a missing sample could mean his job. He had to find it.

Freddy raced through the rows of containers, checking each for any sign of a sample out of place. Each organ he passed looked healthier than the last, growing nicely and all vacuum-sealed at the top. He moved to the samples next, noting that each one marked empty the day before remained so, while every occupied jar matched the previous day‚Äôs manifest. Freddy ran his hands through his wet black hair, sweat stinging his eyes as thoughts raced through his mind. He‚Äôd lose his job over this. And given the clandestine nature of the operation, he wasn‚Äôt entirely sure he wouldn‚Äôt lose more once his employers were through with him.

Freddy considered his options. He could leave the warehouse now, cut through downtown, and slip into the Roman Stacks where no one would seek him out. But if he did that, he had just as likely a chance of being killed by a wandering scavenger there as he did being killed here, almost certain either way. He considered going to Vargos PD; they would certainly charge him for his role in the operation, but corporate judges were quick to cut deals with small fish if it meant landing a big one. Then there was the option of calling a Gilded Teeth gangster to tip them off about the operation, they‚Äôd sack the place and‚Äì

‚ÄúFeed‚Ä¶stitch‚Ä¶see.‚Äù

Freddy‚Äôs racing thoughts halted so sharply he groaned, as if a needle had been shoved straight through his iris and into his skull. He collapsed to his knees on the sticky metal floor, gripping the side of his head and searching frantically for the source of the noise. Forcing himself upright, he staggered into the rows of containers again, waiting for the voice to return. But he was greeted only by a booming silence, broken only by the metallic clink of his shoes echoing like hollow bells on the floor.

He tried to compose himself as his mind spun faster and faster. What was happening to him? Where was the missing sample?

His job!

The thought struck like a hammer, rattling through his ribs. Panic surged as he returned to worrying about the consequences of the lost sample, what had driven him to spend hours scouring the rows of jars only to find them unchanged, while that wet, crawling voice gnawed at the edges of his mind. Freddy staggered out of the rows and up to the warehouse‚Äôs upper floor, where the central terminal sat humming. Maybe he had a chance to find it there.

The benefit of their security system was its precision. It could pick out the location of any genetic marker not present in the jars and not registered in the ‚Äúknowns‚Äù database maintained by Teffer Plastics. It would show him where the sample was, maybe even lead him to it in time to resuscitate it and return it to the fluid.

Freddy entered the terminal room and sat before the beast of a computer. Eighteen screens, not including the security feeds, all monitoring body parts or communicating with a Scripty somewhere across the city. He had never been one for hacking, even in a technology-obsessed city like Vargos, but he knew enough to get the tracker running. He entered his credentials and scanned the screens as the system began its sweep, performing a security screening for every inch of the complex. Each room lit up as it scanned, splashing bright blue light across his face with every ‚Äúall-clear‚Äù alert. The glow pressed against his skin like a cool hand, steadying his breath, until the Queue Cylinders room flared red. The color didn‚Äôt just fill the screen; it pulsed outward, bleeding into the walls, hammering in his chest like a second heartbeat.

‚ÄúGotchu,‚Äù he growled, hopping from the terminal and rushing down the steel stairs toward the chamber. Wherever this sample had been left when he blacked out, it was in his grasp now. He only hoped it was still fresh enough not to be liquidated, another infraction that would almost certainly mean the end of his job.

He approached the Queue Cylinders and took in the sight of the bloated bodies suspended within them. The monitors showed no integrity breaches, which brought some relief: the most expensive products in the facility were still intact. He moved closer to their low, white glow and searched the shadows for any trace of the sample he‚Äôd seen before. He checked the room‚Äôs corners, desk cabinets, even beneath the loose fluid and electric cables snaking across the floor toward the cylinders. Summoning his strength, he lifted the thickest fluid cable to peek beneath only to be struck by a sharp pain in his eye that sent him reeling backward. He dropped the cable onto his foot, his hands shooting to his head as the weight crushed his toes in an instant. Freddy collapsed with a howl that ricocheted off the titanium and steel walls.

He groaned, writhing, as the voice slithered up his spine and seeped past the blood-brain barrier, implanting itself between the two halves of his mind.

‚ÄúComplete‚Ä¶it.‚Äù

The sound was like black ink poured into his eardrums‚Äìwet, muffled, hardly translated to words. It was as if the noise were impersonating language but never fully forming it.

A bright light struck Freddy‚Äôs eye the next morning, jolting him awake. He tore from his bed and staggered back as two figures loomed over him. His shriek bounced across the room as he scrambled away, his voice breaking against the roar in his ears. Their voices, if he could even call them that, were a muffled roar, hollow, unfinished, impossible to shape into language. Not that it mattered; the sound of his own screaming nearly drowned them out.

His throat burned raw in seconds as his eyes refused to shut, forced open to take in the sight. The two figures stood in shadow, bodies dripping with thick onyx tar that oozed from every contour and evaporated into the other shadows of the dank room. Their eyes glowed white-hot in the darkness. They turned the suggestion of their heads toward each other, nodding once, before shifting back to Freddy‚Äôs writhing form.

Freddy saw light erupt from their hands before he felt a powerful force slam into him. Once. Then again. Again. And again. His chest and legs burned, each sting accompanied by a spreading warmth, like a wet blanket wrapping him tighter with every hit. Finally, his voice gave out. He sank back toward the ground, smiling ear to ear as he whipped his arms through the liquid pooling beneath him. At last Freddy went quiet. Then still.

The two figures glanced at each other, security uniforms cleanly pressed, eyes heavy with the tired resignation so common in Vargos. They holstered their sidearms and knelt over Freddy‚Äôs lifeless body.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that? Did you have to pump him like that, Dutch?‚Äù the younger guard muttered.

The older man cleared his throat and motioned for him to follow. ‚ÄúStandard protocol,‚Äù he grumbled, striding down the hall toward the rest of the complex. ‚ÄúBosses said never take chances with anything strange here. Too much on the line. It‚Äôs fine, he was just a monitor. Plenty more where he came from in this city.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do we tell the higher-ups?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat we followed protocol. Now come on, we‚Äôll come back and deal with it. Let‚Äôs get some coffee first.‚Äù

The men walked past the rows of samples, through the Queue Cylinder room, heading for the exit. Something caught the younger guard‚Äôs eye. He whistled for his companion and stepped closer, peering into the pale glow of the cylinders. Bloated bodies floated in the fluid, shifting gently and silent aside from the beep of machines and the occasional bubble from the Yongheng fluid. He groaned.

‚ÄúDamn. This is what they grow bodies in?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Host bodies. Supposed to keep organs transplant-ready at a moment‚Äôs notice.‚Äù The old man slapped a hand against one of the cylinders. The tissue inside bobbed lazily in the fluid.

‚ÄúMan, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd want something that‚Äôs been sitting in one of these things inside of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, come on. There‚Äôs at least four hearts and six livers in this thing. Take what you can get, this is Vargos. You and I aren‚Äôt making enough to see a cybernetic organ anytime soon. Nope, you‚Äôre looking at where that lung you‚Äôll eventually need is coming from, if you keep up that smoking.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sure.‚Äù The young man shuddered and waved toward the door.

They shut the warehouse behind them and disappeared into the crowded streets of Vargos. Inside a heavy silence settled. Freddy‚Äôs corpse lay sprawled on the floor, a manic smile stapled across his face. The rows of organs and tissue samples remained tended by the system, the terminal‚Äôs monitors blinking steadily as it maintained integrity. And in the Queue Cylinders, the bloated bodies floated, temperature regulated, steady as ever, save for the one that twitched. Its pudgy arm drifted forward, pressing a heavy hand against the inner surface of the glass. The fingers flexed once, joints bending impossibly far back, and a faint groan escaped the cylinder as pressure pushed outward.",1,1756999026.0,Cyberpunk,0,1.0,False

Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, reflecting Bahrain's office districts., Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil GDP expanded by 6.2% in Q1 2025, outpacing not only its neighbors but also most emerging markets. The government‚Äôs Economic Vision 2030 continues to drive genuine reforms‚Äîsimplified licensing, digitalized registration through Sijilat and MOICT portals, and foreign ownership rights, positioning Bahrain as the region‚Äôs friendliest country for expat founders.\
\
In my experience, even competitors from the UAE acknowledge how Bahrain‚Äôs flexible regulatory environment, lower costs, and English-language documentation make life easier for startups.\
\
Unlike Dubai, where costs can spiral quickly, or Riyadh, with more complex labor permissions, Bahrain‚Äôs company formation process is transparent, digital, and genuinely fast. In 2025, the ‚ÄúSmartCR‚Äù initiative allows you to reserve a company name and obtain your Sijilat commercial registration in as little as 48 hours‚Äîif you know which paperwork to prep in advance.\
The Short Answer: Yes, There Are Government Grants for Startups\
Surprisingly, the answer is a strong yes: Bahrain does offer government grants and other support programs for startups. But‚Äîand this is a big but‚Äînot all grants are direct cash handouts. Most are delivered through hybrid support: partial grants, subsidized loans, training, and incubation combined, usually tied to specific sectors or innovative business models.\
Key government grant and support programs include:\
- Tamkeen: Bahrain‚Äôs best-known semi-governmental agency, offering grants and wage subsidies.\
- Bahrain Development Bank (BDB) Seed Fuel Fund: Early-stage financing and guidance.\
- EDB (Economic Development Board): Facilitates large-scale and strategic investments.\
- Startup Bahrain & Incubators: Competitive grant contests, subsidized office space, and accelerator programs.\
- MOICT Innovation Grants: Annual cycles targeting digital transformation and sustainability.\
Below, I‚Äôll unpack each of these along with tactical, real-world advice for maximizing your chances.\

- Wage Subsidy Grants: Pay up to 70% of Bahraini staff salaries for the first 18‚Äì24 months.\
- Training Grants: Fund skill development for founders and local employees.\
- Export Support: Grants for participation in overseas expos and trade missions.\
In 2025, Tamkeen launched a new Green Innovation Grant (May 2025), offering BHD 10,000‚Äì30,000 for sustainability-focused businesses with eco-friendly products‚Äîperfect for tech, agri, or fintech startups.\

If your business is high-growth (fintech, cloud, AI, manufacturing, logistics), the Bahrain Economic Development Board can fast-track grants, land permits, and regulatory approvals‚Äîfor both local and foreign-owned companies. In 2025, the EDB‚Äôs ‚ÄúStrategic Sectors Accelerate‚Äù initiative made it possible for eligible startups to enjoy:\
\
Zero-fee commercial registration for the first year.\
Matching grants for tech infrastructure, up to BHD 25,000.\
Priority access to free zone benefits in Salman Industrial City.\
\
Personal aside:\
I once watched a fintech founder secure a BHD 40,000 EDB grant over a single majlis networking evening‚Äîbecause he‚Äôd built a relationship during Ramadan, when business hours shift and meetings often happen over suhoor or iftar.\
Step-by-Step Guidance: Bahrain Company Formation with Support Programs\
1. Choose the Right Entity & Ownership Structure\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in startup environment., SPC (Single Person Company), or BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company).\
For most founders, a WLL or SPC is fastest and simplest.\
Foreigners can own up to 100% of most entities, especially in tech, consultancy, and trading‚Äîsee this guide: Foreign Ownership in Bahrain.\
\
WLL: Simple, ideal for 2-50 shareholders.\
SPC: Single founder, rapid setup.\
BSC: Needed for larger capital and public fundraising.\
\
\
Don‚Äôt skip the local customs‚Äîschedule a meet-and-greet with your LLPs or sponsors at a Seef District majlis. Not only is it polite, but you‚Äôll also hear insider tips on streamlining the licensing process.\

2. Budgeting and Cost Considerations\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain startups.:**\
\
Basic company incorporation fees: BHD 100‚Äì250\
Office rent (Seef, Diplomatic Area): BHD 200‚Äì400/month for flex desk, BHD 600‚Äì1200/month for small private office\
Visa/Labour permits per expat: BHD 250‚Äì350\
(Don‚Äôt forget MOICT and LMRA e-signature fees, which have increased slightly since April 2025.)\
\
Common mistake:\
Underestimating Sijilat registration or municipality approval time. Secure a ‚Äúvirtual office‚Äù lease in a business center with pre-existing MOICT approvals. Check this cost breakdown & calculator.\
3. Registration: The Sijilat Portal and Documents\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation for company formation in Bahrain. platform means nearly all paperwork is digital.\
Essential documents:\
\
Passport(s) of all shareholders\
Memorandum of Association (in Arabic and English)\
Proof of address (lease or ownership)\
Business plan (2‚Äì3 pages is usually sufficient for Tamkeen/BDB)\
KYC and Source of Funds declaration\
\
Time-saving hack:\
Use a specialized business centre in Seef or Bahrain Financial Harbour that pre-screens your documents and submits through their portal access‚Äîthis can slash waiting time by 3‚Äì5 days, in my experience.\
Pro tip: Most MOICT offices are busiest Sundays and Mondays; aim for Wednesday mornings for fastest queue times, especially post-Ramadan when footfall is lowest.\

2. Prepare bilingual summaries and show how their project helps Bahrainisation or local talent development.\
3. Establish a presence in key business districts (Seef, Bahrain Bay, or Diplomatic Area) to attend Tamkeen, BDB, or EDB info sessions‚Äîmajlis networking is still where deals happen.\
Resource tip:\

Bahrain-Specific Business Customs That Matter\
You‚Äôll quickly notice that business moves at two speeds: lightning-fast for those with strong local relationships, and glacial for the unprepared.\
- Majlis Meetings: Sit, sip coffee, and tuck in your elevator pitch between casual banter.\
- Ramadan Hours: Most government offices shorten hours‚Äîplan accordingly.\
- Coffee Protocol: Always accept the first cup, even if you won‚Äôt finish it. It‚Äôs a sign of respect.\
Unexpected tangent:\
I once missed a critical Tamkeen info session because I didn‚Äôt realize meetings shifted to 8:30 pm during Ramadan. Now, I always double-check seasonal office hours (and keep a spare thobe in the office for last-minute majlis calls).\
Regulatory Updates for 2025\
\
May 2025: Green Innovation Grant introduced by Tamkeen‚Äîup to BHD 30,000 for startups in sustainability sectors.\
January 2025: New LMRA e-signature requirement for all commercial registration renewals‚Äîdon‚Äôt skip the biometric scan at Bahrain Financial Harbour or risk delays.\
March 2025: MOICT increased online portal fees by 5% and now auto-rejects digitized documents missing Arabic translation.\

Ownership, Sponsorship & Free Zone Options\
\

Free Zones (see more): Salman Industrial City, Bahrain Logistics Zone‚Äîoffer zero customs on re-exports, no foreign currency controls, and direct customs clearance.\
Local sponsorship is rare but sometimes needed for specific activities: More info\
\
Comparing UAE/Saudi vs. Bahrain:\
Bahrain‚Äôs process is leaner, with fewer hidden costs, no mandatory Emirati partner for most activities, and less bureaucratic friction.\
Ongoing Compliance & Bookkeeping\
\
Alt text: Accounting and bookkeeping services for Bahrain companies.).\
- Quarterly VAT filings: Bahraini VAT is 5%, with digital filings via the NBR portal.\
- Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA): All staff visas and Labour Market Fees must be renewed yearly.\
Importantly, effective compliance not only protects your license but also speeds up future grant approvals.\
Common mistake:\
Entrepreneurs often delay opening a Bahrain-based bank account‚Äîdo this immediately after obtaining your Sijilat number, since most grant disbursements require a local IBAN.\
Practical Insider Tips for Faster, Cheaper, Stress-Free Formation\
\
Target low-traffic days (Wednesday-Thursday mornings) for all government offices.\
Use business centers in Seef or Bahrain Bay with in-house MOICT liaisons.\
Prepare all documents in both Arabic and English (use certified translators).\
Attend Tamkeen/BDB info sessions in person‚Äîrelationships help fast-track approvals.\
Budget for at least BHD 1,500‚Äì2,500 in working capital for the first three months, even with grants in the pipeline.\
Keep your network active at local events‚Äîmany opportunities arise informally, such as during Thursday evening business majlis.\
\
(When a client‚Äôs application stalled, I used a direct contact at Tamkeen‚Äôs Diplomatic Area branch to clarify a minor documentation error. The issue? The business plan included only English. Adding the Arabic translation resolved it in 24 hours.)\

Q6: Can I apply for multiple grants (Tamkeen + BDB)?\
\
Yes‚Äîwith separate business plans and clear financial separation. Many founders ‚Äústack‚Äù a Tamkeen wage subsidy with a BDB equipment grant for maximum support.\

1n8cx8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1n8cx8h/explore_if_biokleen_bacout_stain_remover_really/,Explore If Biokleen Bac-Out Stain Remover Really Works on Pet Messes,"Testing products is something I do daily, so I‚Äôve had the chance to work with an array of cleaners, including the Biokleen Bac-Out Enzyme Stain & Odor Remover, model B00034. This one seemed like it could solve an array of life's unsightly messes, though I wasn‚Äôt without some initial skepticism. The promise of being eco-friendly and non-toxic definitely caught my attention, particularly as I share my home with one overly curious cat, an accident-prone dog, and the occasional red wine spill (is it really a home without that combination?). Over several weeks, I‚Äôve tested it on various types of stains, odors, and fabrics‚Äîspanning from carpet chaos to laundry mishaps. Here‚Äôs the full breakdown of what I found.  

**How It Works**  
The standout feature of this stain and odor remover lies in its bio-active formula. It relies on a blend of live enzyme cultures to break down and absorb organic material, effectively tackling anything from pet accidents to wine spills. I‚Äôm not going to lie‚Äîthere‚Äôs something deeply satisfying about spraying it on a stain, walking away, and returning to find the original mess basically gone. It works by digesting the stain components, something I noticed particularly when dealing with a classic coffee spill. The enzymes essentially ate through the stain, leaving the carpet looking like the clumsy morning hadn‚Äôt happened. 

**Positives**  
- Handles pet-related stains and odors with impressive efficiency.  
- The natural enzyme-based cleaning feels safer around kids and pets.  
- No overpowering artificial fragrances; just a subtle, fresh scent.  
- Works across multiple surfaces like carpets, couches, and laundry.  
- Biodegradable and eco-friendly formula adds an ethical bonus.  

[Check Biokleen B00034 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0061vzqwo/)

**Drawbacks**  
- Larger, older stains needed multiple applications for complete removal.  
- The bottle design feels a bit standard; a spray nozzle would have been more convenient.  
- While it‚Äôs marketed as plant-based, sensitive users may still want gloves to avoid potential mild irritation.

**Usability in My Everyday Life**  
I loved how versatile this cleaning product was. Take, for example, our fluffy golden retriever. His pawprints made their way onto the couch cushion (right after a rainy walk), and this remover tackled the dirt effortlessly. I used the same product on an old T-shirt stained with pasta sauce and was equally impressed. It even worked on those stubborn smells in our diaper pail, neutralizing the odor instead of just masking it. 

One detail I appreciated was how it didn‚Äôt have an overwhelming chemical smell. Instead, there‚Äôs a faint, pleasant scent that lingers after you use it. This is fantastic if you don‚Äôt want your entire house reeking of cleaning products. However, I did run into some minor frustration when using the product on an older, set-in coffee mark that I had ignored for weeks. It lightened the stain significantly, but I had to go through three rounds of spraying and blotting before the remnants disappeared completely. Not perfect, but still impressive for what it is.

**Key Benefits**  
- Gentle yet effective formula suitable for commercial use.  
- Great for environmentally conscious households.  
- Highly multi-purpose, working on everything from wine spills to diaper pails.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing the Biokleen remover with something like Nature‚Äôs Miracle proved insightful. Both have strong enzyme formulations, but this option is far more eco-conscious and biodegradable, an upgrade for anyone concerned about the environment. Nature‚Äôs Miracle, however, tends to be slightly faster with heavy-duty odors and has a more versatile nozzle. Then, there‚Äôs OxiClean‚Äôs stain remover, which is a strong contender for stubborn laundry stains. However, it doesn‚Äôt have that bio-friendly aspect, nor can it properly handle odors. This product comes out ahead for those with diverse cleaning needs and a preference for non-toxic solutions.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
It‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, yet it‚Äôs far from the most expensive. Considering the enormous jug (a full 128 ounces!), you‚Äôre getting quite a lot of product for what you pay. I‚Äôve found it performs more consistently across various stains and odors than cheaper solutions, so the slight extra cost feels justified, especially when you factor in the eco-friendly, US-made formula. If you, like me, value both effective cleaning and minimizing environmental impact, it‚Äôs a proper example of smart spending.

My grandmother¬†passed away¬†a few years ago after a long battle with cancer. Even as her health deteriorated, she never lost her spirit. She‚Äôd still get excited about whether the Pittsburgh Steelers might finally have a decent season after Ben Roethlisberger‚Äôs retirement. She‚Äôd debate the Pirates‚Äô chances with the kind of passionate optimism that only comes from decades of loyal disappointment.

But what I remember most are the afternoons she‚Äôd spend napping in her favorite chair with my son curled up against her. He‚Äôd drift off clutching some random object, like a wooden spoon or random toy from my parent‚Äôs basement. She‚Äôd just smile and close her eyes too. Even when she was tired, even when the treatments were wearing her down, she found joy in those stolen moments.

In her final years, she lived with my parents, but she brought her faith with her.

Her rosary beads found new homes on nightstands and windowsills. Her worn Bible sat open on the end table, bookmarked with a picture of her husband. The little curio cabinet filled with angels followed her too, a portable shrine to stubborn hope. Wherever she was, the air around her carried that same indefinable quality that I later realized was simply peace.

My grandmother had the kind of faith that could part emotional storms with a single glance. She didn‚Äôt need to preach it. She lived it. You could feel her belief before you even stepped through the front door. She believed in prayer, in miracles, in second chances. In the Steelers. And in Diet Pepsi.

After she was gone, I expected to feel completely untethered. Instead, I discovered something surprising. Things seemed to hold together. The sadness was real and deep, but underneath it was something solid. A foundation I‚Äôd never realized she‚Äôd built in me.

My mother always said I ‚Äúlived with my head in the clouds,‚Äù and it wasn‚Äôt until after Grandma passed that I understood where that came from. While I was raised in the Catholic church and spent years as an altar boy, my faith had always been fuzzier than hers. Less certain. More questions than answers.

But it was there, hidden under the surface, because of her. I‚Äôd been benefiting from her quiet influence in ways I never fully understood or appreciated until she was gone. Her faith hadn‚Äôt just surrounded me. It had somehow taken root in me, even when I wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

**Learning to Recognize What Was Already There**

The months after her death weren‚Äôt filled with the existential crisis I expected. Instead, I found myself noticing things. How I naturally looked for the good in difficult situations. How I held onto hope even when logic suggested otherwise. How I moved through the world with a kind of quiet optimism that I‚Äôd never really examined before.

I was still a¬†professional overthinker, still a card-carrying worrier. But underneath all that mental noise was something steadier. Something that whispered, ‚ÄúThis too shall pass,‚Äù even when I wasn‚Äôt consciously thinking it.

It took time to understand that this wasn‚Äôt something I needed to build from scratch. Grandma hadn‚Äôt just modeled faith for me; she‚Äôd been quietly cultivating it in me all along. Through her example, through her presence, through those countless afternoons when she‚Äôd choose hope over fear, even when the odds were stacked against her health and her beloved sports teams.

**Discovering My Own Messy Version**

What I came to realize was that my faith was never going to look like Grandma‚Äôs. Hers was rooted in tradition, in ritual, in the comfort of centuries-old prayers. Mine was more scattered, cobbled together from different sources and experiences.

My faith, I discovered, is held together with hope, a healthy dose of skepticism, and about six different kinds of sticky notes. It‚Äôs not the neat, organized kind. It‚Äôs more like a spiritual junk drawer full of useful things, but you‚Äôre never quite sure where anything is.

I believe in second chances and fresh starts. I believe in the power of afternoon sun to reset your entire day. I believe that kindness is contagious and that sometimes the universe sends you exactly what you need, even if it arrives late, confused, and covered in cat hair.

Some days, my faith is a whisper: ‚ÄúMaybe things will get better. Maybe I‚Äôm not alone. Maybe I can try again tomorrow.‚Äù Other days, it‚Äôs louder: ‚ÄúThis is hard, but I can handle hard things. I‚Äôve done it before.‚Äù

My faith doesn‚Äôt look like Grandma‚Äôs, but it carries her DNA. It‚Äôs messier, less certain, but it has the same stubborn core, a refusal to give up hope, even when hope seems foolish.

**The Science of Belief**

Here‚Äôs what I wish I‚Äôd known during those dark months: You don‚Äôt have to be religious to benefit from faith. Science shows that belief in something greater than yourself can be a powerful tool for mental and emotional well-being.

Faith literally¬†reduces stress. Studies show that people who report a strong sense of meaning or spiritual belief have lower levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with stress. Translation? Faith helps your brain pump the brakes on panic.

It improves emotional regulation by activating the brain‚Äôs prefrontal cortex, which helps you pause before spiraling. It builds psychological resilience by reminding you that you‚Äôre not at the center of every catastrophe. Whether you believe in God, the universe, karma, or cosmic duct tape, faith acts as a buffer against hopelessness.

Acts of spiritual reflection can trigger the same brain regions involved in feelings of safety and joy. And faith often leads to rituals or conversations with others, building the connections that are crucial for well-being.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: You don‚Äôt have to get it right. Wobbly faith counts. Uncertain, whispered-in-a-closet faith is still valid. Half-hearted ‚ÄúOkay, Universe, I trust you‚Ä¶ kinda‚Äù mutterings are welcome here.

**The Power of Micro-Faith**

Big transformations feel great in theory but hard in practice. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve learned to embrace what I call ‚Äúmicro-faith,‚Äù these small, digestible moments of intentional belief. Like appetizers for your spirit.

Today, try believing in something small:

* The possibility of a good cup of coffee

* The strength hiding inside your own weird little heart

* The fact that what you need might already be on its way

* The idea that this difficult season won‚Äôt last forever

* The chance that tomorrow might feel a little lighter

Faith doesn‚Äôt have to be grand or glowing. Sometimes it‚Äôs just showing up anyway, even when you‚Äôre not sure why.

**What Grandma Taught Me**

Years later, I realize Grandma didn‚Äôt just give me faith; she showed me how to live it. She taught me that faith isn‚Äôt about having all the answers. It‚Äôs about trusting that you‚Äôll find your way, even in the dark.

She taught me that belief can be quiet and still be powerful. That faith isn‚Äôt a destination but a traveling companion. That sometimes the most profound act of faith is simply getting up and trying again.

Most importantly, she taught me that faith isn‚Äôt about perfection. It‚Äôs about showing up. Showing up to your life, to your relationships, to your own healing, even when you feel completely unprepared.

I carry pieces of her faith with me now, mixed in with my own messy, imperfect beliefs. Some days I feel like I‚Äôm floating through life with my head in the clouds. But thanks to Grandma, and a whole lot of trial and error, I‚Äôve learned to float up here without getting totally fried by the sun.

If your faith feels fractured, fuzzy, or faint, you‚Äôre not doing it wrong. You‚Äôre just human. Faith isn‚Äôt a finish line. It‚Äôs a floating device. It won‚Äôt always steer you straight, but it might keep you above water long enough to find the shore.

So go ahead and believe in something today. Even if it‚Äôs just the idea that the clouds will eventually clear‚Ä¶ and the coffee won‚Äôt taste burnt this time.",1,1756998653.0,Stress,0,1.0,False

This 15.6-inch device sits nicely in the realm of budget-friendly laptops while delivering just enough to keep everyday tasks running smoothly. And being lightweight at just 3 pounds, lugging it around during errands and coffee-shop work sessions didn‚Äôt feel like a chore, which was a big plus.

**Design and Portability**  
The sleek black design immediately caught my eye, understated yet professional enough for both personal and business use. Its slim profile, only 0.78 inches thick, and the 14.09 x 9.53 dimensions meant it fit snugly in my backpack. The full-sized keyboard, complete with a numeric keypad, was spacious and comfortable for someone who types steadily throughout the day. That said, the keyboard isn‚Äôt backlit, so working in dimly lit settings presented a mild inconvenience. The 720p HD webcam up top serves well for virtual meetings, though it doesn‚Äôt quite rival the clarity of higher-end models. 

**Performance and Speed**  
Switching it on, I immediately tuned into the power of the AMD Athlon Silver 3050U processor. Everyday operations like browsing, handling spreadsheets, and toggling between multiple apps were smooth, owing to its Turbo Boost capability of up to 3.2 GHz. Combined with the AMD Radeon Graphics, casual gaming and streaming on Netflix felt fluid too. Admittedly, I wouldn‚Äôt attempt anything too graphic-intensive here‚Äîit‚Äôs simply not designed for that. Still, for its target audience of students and general users, this combination nails functionality.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight build makes it ideal for portability.  
- AMD Athlon processor is efficient for multitasking.  
- Crisp 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display ensures vibrant colors and sharp visuals.

**Display and Viewing Experience**  
The 15.6-inch screen boasts a Full HD resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, and with the IPS panel, viewing angles were delightfully wide without any image distortions. Whether watching a movie or reviewing design work, the colors felt natural and bright, hitting a 250-nit brightness level. The narrow bezels provided immersive content viewing, though the anti-glare coating was what really stood out during my time outdoors. While the screen is suitable for most, professionals dealing with high-end photo or video editing might miss deeper color accuracy.

**Connectivity Options**  
What surprised me was the range of connectivity. Three USB ports (1 Type-C and 2 Type-A), an HDMI 1.4b, and even an Ethernet port (RJ-45) lend it huge versatility. The inclusion of a SD Media Card Reader and a headphone/mic combo jack was particularly useful during testing, though the WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 capabilities ensured a smoother wireless experience than I was initially expecting.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Keyboard lacks backlighting, making nighttime use more challenging.  
- Integrated graphics limit advanced gaming or intensive graphical tasks.  
- Speakers, despite their stereo setup, could use more depth in audio quality.  

**Other Options**  
While this laptop shines in its category, there are some notable competitors to keep in mind. Acer Aspire laptops often offer similar specs but edge slightly ahead in battery life. On the other hand, Lenovo Ideapads provide better keyboards, ideal for those who type extensively. However, Lenovo‚Äôs comparable models at this price point tend to skimp on display quality, one of the HP 255's core advantages. Dell‚Äôs Inspiron series provides similar performance, but I‚Äôve found their build to be chunkier compared to this HP model‚Äôs sleek design. Between these rivals, the HP 255 seems to balance portability, performance, and media specs more effectively.

**Value for Money**  
For its price point, the HP 255 delivers plenty of punch. The SSD storage of 256 GB allows for quick boot-ups and smoother workflow transitions, which I noticed while juggling multiple project files. Combine this with 8 GB DDR4 RAM, and the laptop doesn‚Äôt break a sweat with regular multitasking. The year-long access to Microsoft Office 365 and the included Windows 11 System Recovery USB were thoughtful bonuses, adding an extra layer of utility. Looking at other laptops with similar specifications, I‚Äôd say this one holds its ground at providing excellent quality for the price.

Had my Arkel Coast for about 3/4 months now and have been loving it. Pretty much went all in as a first setup and have been learning a lot. 

I‚Äôve started to fine tune things now that I have a decent general understanding. Pressure is currently at the default of about 12.5 when extracting a shot.
Reading the manual, it recommends adjusting pressure  to about 11, but I see a lot of info online suggesting 9 bar. Could it be that 11 bar is better for the machine in particular , or should I just adjust to 9? 
Curious to see how the adjustment affects the shot üò≥

Synthesis:

Start with Dry 1-butanol, then dissolve ~1.5‚ÄØg sodium in 50‚ÄØmL 1-butanol to make sodium butoxide. Add 30‚ÄØmL diethyl malonate, then 30‚ÄØmL 2-iodopropane (isopropyl iodide).Reflux with stirring for 3‚Äì4 hours.Make another 1.5‚ÄØg sodium / 50‚ÄØmL butanol sodium butoxide solution.

Add to the reaction along with 18‚ÄØg dry urea. Reflux for 6 hours. Let cool. Add 150‚ÄØmL water to dissolve salts. Two layers form. Separate water layer. Wash once with a small amount of petroleum ether. Acidify with 60‚Äì70‚ÄØmL of 33% HCl. Crude product separates and crystallizes. Cool in freezer, filter, wash with water, and dry. Recrystallize in hot water if desired. Expect 30% yeild

You have

Propisobarbital







(Optional step)

If you want to turn it into sodium salt form: (Extra)

Add 1.00 g of barbiturate to a clean 100‚Äì250 mL beaker. Add 20 mL of distilled water. Warm gently on a hot plate (no boiling) while stirring with a magnetic stir bar. Stir until most or all of the solid dissolves (some cloudiness is fine for now) Weigh 0.08 g of NaOH. Slowly add it to the warm solution in small portions. Stir continuously. The solution will typically become clearer. Optional: check pH it should be around 7‚Äì9 (if too acidic, add a few mg more NaOH). Remove the beaker from heat and let it cool to room temp. Slowly add 60 mL of cold ethanol (3√ó the volume of water used). Add it gradually while stirring, not all at once. The sodium salt will start to crash out as a white to off-white solid. Place the beaker in a refrigerator or freezer for 30‚Äì60 minutes to encourage full crystallization. Stir gently before filtering if solid clumps form. Filter the solid using filter paper or a coffee filter and a funnel. Wash the solid with a small amount (10 mL) of cold ethanol to remove impurities. Allow to air dry or use mild heat (40‚Äì50‚ÄØ¬∞C) on a hot plate to speed up drying.

Now your left with the sodium salt form of:

1n8cke9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1n8cke9/investigate_if_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker/,Investigate if the Best Single-Serve Coffee Maker is Keurig K-Elite,"Testing out the Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker has been quite an adventure for me as a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur. It‚Äôs not just another coffee maker taking up counter space; it has genuinely changed my morning routine (and probably made me less grumpy before my caffeine kicks in). The Keurig K-Elite feels like it‚Äôs built for people who want convenient, fast coffee without compromising on choice or taste. From its premium brushed silver finish to the array of features, this single-serve brewer offers quite a lot. 

**Modern Design with Functional Appeal**  
Having a coffee maker that looks stylish and doesn‚Äôt embarrass me when guests are over is a win. With its brushed silver finish and sleek design, this machine blends seamlessly into modern kitchens. I have mine sitting on the corner of my countertop and it almost feels like a chic d√©cor piece. Beyond aesthetics, it‚Äôs well-built and sturdy, weighing just about 8 pounds. The buttons on top are simple to navigate, even when I‚Äôm basically half-asleep. The tall removable drip tray is one of my favorite features because it fits my giant travel mug without any awkward tilting or spilling.

**Brew Customization Options Galore**  
One of the great parts is the customizable brewing options. Whether I‚Äôm in the mood for a strong brew (especially on groggy Mondays) or something lighter in the afternoon, this coffee maker offers it all. There‚Äôs even an iced setting that brews hot coffee over ice‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifesaver on those sweltering summer afternoons. Adjusting the temperature between 187¬∞ and 192¬∞ Fahrenheit is another highlight. It‚Äôs easy to tweak and hasn‚Äôt let me down for a full-flavored cup yet.

**[Check Keurig K-Elite price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b0788f3r8x/)**  

**Perfect for Busy Mornings**  
Time is usually not on my side in the mornings, but the efficiency of this coffee maker has been a game-changer. It brews a fresh cup in mere minutes, helping me stick to my tight schedule. The 75-ounce water reservoir is incredibly convenient since I only need to refill once every six to eight cups. The machine even has a maintenance reminder for descaling, which is a godsend for someone like me who rarely remembers to clean appliances. 

**Key Benefits**  
‚Ä¢ Brews multiple sizes from 4 oz. to 12 oz., accommodating various preferences.  
‚Ä¢ The removable drip tray is a thoughtful touch for travel mugs and cleanup.  
‚Ä¢ Strong Brew button enhances the flavor for a bolder cup.  
‚Ä¢ Hot Water on Demand works great for soup when I am lazy or rushed.  

**Potential Drawbacks**  
For all its glory, this product does have a few hiccups.  
‚Ä¢ The machine is slightly noisy while brewing; not ideal when trying not to wake others.  
‚Ä¢ Some users might find the price point on the higher side for a single-serve brewer.  
‚Ä¢ The K-Cup pods, though convenient, can rack up costs over time.

**Peer Products**  
While the Keurig K-Elite has been a solid performer for me, other options like the Nespresso Vertuo and Cuisinart SS-10 deserve mention. Nespresso Vertuo brings excellent espresso quality into the mix, but it doesn‚Äôt quite match Keurig‚Äôs versatility in brew sizes or iced coffee feature. On the other hand, the Cuisinart SS-10 offers a reusable filter option (as does this Keurig, to be fair), but the build quality doesn‚Äôt feel as robust as the Keurig‚Äôs. If you‚Äôre more into customizable brewing settings, the K-Elite still edges these competitors out.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Looking at the features, this coffee maker provides affordable quality, considering all that it offers. The flexibility of brewing coffee to your liking, paired with its striking design, justifies its investment. While it may seem like a splurge initially, the time saved, the convenience, and the overall performance make it a worthy contender for your kitchen.

Same steps you replace Con hcl with Hydrobromic acid in first step



Clomethiazole HCL Synthesis:

Sulfurol ( 4-me-5-thiazole-ethanol ), Con hcl, Alcohol (iso,ethyl,methyl) , PTFE (Teflon), Distilled water, and a Heavy-walled borosilicate pressure vessel 

In a sturdy heavy-walled borosilicate pressure vessel, carefully add 125 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 10 g sulfurol (2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-ylmethanol). Make sure the vessel is dry before adding chemicals. Seal the vessel tightly using a PTFE (Teflon) threaded stopper, then wrap the threads with PTFE tape to ensure a leak-proof seal. This prevents any corrosive fumes or liquid from escaping during heating. Place the sealed vessel into an oil bath preheated to 150¬∞C. Maintain this temperature for 3 hours, allowing the reaction to proceed under pressure. The high temperature promotes the formation of clomethiazole hydrochloride by substitution. 

After 3 hours, carefully remove the vessel from the oil bath and let it cool briefly before opening. Pour the reaction mixture into a round-bottom flask. Using a rotary evaporator or vacuum setup, remove the excess hydrochloric acid under reduced pressure at a temperature below 50¬∞C. This avoids decomposition and leaves behind a dark, semi-solid sticky residue containing the crude product. Gradually add isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol) to the residue with continuous stirring. Keep the mixture heated gently just below the boiling point of isopropanol (80¬∞C) to fully dissolve the residue. This ensures a homogeneous solution for better crystallization. Allow the solution to cool down slowly to room temperature, then place the flask in a freezer at around 20¬∞C for about 3 hours. This cold environment helps the clomethiazole hydrochloride crystallize out of solution. 

Filter the formed white crystalline solid using vacuum or gravity filtration through filter paper or a coffee filter. Rinse the crystals once with a small amount (10 mL) of cold isopropanol to wash off impurities. Dry the collected crystals gently, either by air drying in a low humidity environment or using mild heat (below 50¬∞C) on a hot plate or drying oven to avoid melting or degradation. The final yield is typically around 8.2 g (60%) of white clomethiazole hydrochloride crystals, which should have a pungent odor characteristic of the compound.

If I were doing it today, I‚Äôd use AI copilots to launch the first version in a weekend.

Here‚Äôs my step-by-step AI-copilot playbook.

# Friday Evening: Find a pain worth solving

Bad ideas come from guessing. Good ideas come from pain you‚Äôve seen or felt ‚Äî but you still need proof that pain exists for others.

**Goal:** By bedtime, know what problem you‚Äôre solving and why it‚Äôs worth two days of your time.¬†

Here‚Äôs how:

* **Deep scan the market:** Open Perplexity or Gemini and type: ‚ÄúList every tool that helps \[target audience\] with \[problem\]. Show 5 common complaints from user reviews.‚Äù
* **Dig into reviews:** Go to G2, Capterra, or Reddit. Copy 50‚Äì100 reviews into ChatGPT and ask: ‚ÄúWhat frustrates users most about these tools? What do they wish existed?‚Äù
* **Choose a gap:** Pick one pain point you can imagine solving with a single screen or flow.

**Output:** A one-line idea you can say out loud without stumbling.

For the purpose of this post, I‚Äôll use this example: ‚ÄúA tool for freelancers that auto-generates client proposals in their tone, without manual copy-pasting.‚Äù

# Saturday Morning: Draft a clickable mockup in 4 hours

You don‚Äôt need to write real code. You need something people can click to imagine the solution exists.

* **Option 1: Cursor (AI coding IDE)**
   * Create a project and prompt: ‚ÄúBuild a one-page web app with a headline, input box, and a button that says ‚ÄòGenerate Proposal.‚Äô Use Tailwind CSS.‚Äù
   * Cursor scaffolds code, you copy-paste the snippets it suggests and hit deploy on Vercel.
* **Option 2:** [**V0.dev**](http://V0.dev) **or Framer (No-code)**
   * Type what you want (‚ÄúA landing page for a proposal generator app, with upload field and sample results‚Äù), drag components, export.

No logos, no perfect design. A single path that proves the concept.

# Saturday Afternoon: Line up testers while you build

The fastest way to kill a weekend test is to spend all Saturday polishing a demo that nobody sees.

So, recruit testers in parallel with building. Don‚Äôt wait until Sunday to start from zero. Here‚Äôs how.

**Leverage your own network first:**¬† DM ex-colleagues, LinkedIn connections clients, friends who know someone in your target group, or people you‚Äôve seen complain about this pain.

||
||
| ""Hey, I'm testing an idea this weekend: an AI tool that writes client proposals in your tone. Would you try it tomorrow and give me 5 mins of feedback? Free early access + $10 coffee card.""|

**Go where the pain lives:**

Post short, specific asks in:

* Niche subreddits (e.g., r/freelance, r/SaaS)
* Indie Hackers, niche Facebook groups, or founder Slack/Discord communities
* LinkedIn posts or comments in relevant threads Don‚Äôt just post and pray ‚Äî follow up with DMs to people who like or reply.

**Aim for a soft yes:**¬† You want 3‚Äì5 people who say ‚Äúsure, send me the link tomorrow.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt waste time chasing instant calls with cold strangers. Set expectations that you‚Äôll circle back with a demo to click through or a Loom to watch.

# Saturday Evening: Build just enough to test (Wizard of Oz)

Now that people are waiting to try it, you can build something lightweight but believable:

* Use Cursor, [V0.dev](http://V0.dev), or Framer for a clickable page.
* Skip the backend. If your tool promises magic, you‚Äôll fake it:
   * Run their inputs through ChatGPT manually.
   * Email or DM them polished results as if the product did it.

**The entire point:** Let testers experience the outcome, not the tech. That‚Äôs what tells you if they care enough to pay.

# Sunday Morning: Close the loop with your signups

Start the day with people who already said yes yesterday:

1n8cjrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianMen/comments/1n8cjrd/advice_on_navigating_my_feelings/,Advice on navigating my feelings?,"¬†am 27 M and got recently transferred to another place.4 years back i met 25 F in my office. When she was in college she had messaged me on linkedin looking for advice and that was my first interaction with her. Then i met her in office and she introduced herself as the same girl who had messaged me. We both graduated from same college and one of her and one of my parents belonged to same native place. We gradually became friends and started accompanying each other for coffee breaks. I really enjoyed her company and we had a lot of common interests. i wasnt looking for any relationship and she had a strict no dating rule esatablished until she had made good amount of money. So love was out of the question.

Now 6 months back , I got transferred t completely new place (which is my dream city). And 3 months back she also shifted here for the same project. I had travelled the city and been to nearby places and was enjoying my new life but it quickly became lonely since i knew anyone here and it was hard for me to make friends here . Thats when she shifted too 3 months back. I showed her all the places and i was finally happy to have some company. We would explore new restaurants and try all the varieties of food on weekends. This became our daily routine. When i shifted here i was planning on buying a car but since she loves travelling in trains i also cultivated that habit and even fotgot about the plan i had lol.

Now day before yesterday, while casually texting she told me her parents are looking for proposals for her marriage. That sentence made me COMPLETELY blank. My sudden thought was why and next thought was why am i not happy for her as her friend. I quickly texted her bye and went for a walk. At night i couldnt sleep and thats when i realised that i had actually fallen in love with her and i remembered all those moments i had spent from the past 3 years . I started feeling sudden sadness at thought of her marrying someone else. Next day I met her and she again said the same thing .But idk if i am overthinking or what BUT there was a hint of sadness in her voice. I have had relationships in the past but i never felt this much in ease with anyone. Whole she was acting weird and would always give side glances towards me. My coworkers also noticed this and one of them told me.

She had told before that due to some circumstances she had difficulty in expressing herself and sometimes cant tell what she wants to since she has deals with overthinking . So i dont have any idea what to do. I am afraid of expressing my feelings and ruining the friendship between us or going ahead and taking the risk. I feel like such a dumbo rn even asking this like a teenage boy struggling with his feelings but i am asking because i dont want to make it awkward between us.Guys please help ur brother on what should i do cuz my mind is completely blank.....",0,1756997995.0,AskIndianMen,6,0.5,False

I‚Äôm a TN lover but always struggle to get exactly what I want, specific leather, color combos, unique foil/emboss patterns, or cool strap accessories. Some shops let you pick leathers/colors, but it‚Äôs still clunky. For example, one shop offered foil stamping, but I didn‚Äôt like their patterns. They said I could bring my own design, but then I‚Äôd have to find or make one and just hope it looks right once stamped, not ideal.

That got me thinking: what if there was a semi-automated AI tool that could generate mockups of your dream TN? You‚Äôd pick the size (Passport or Standard), type a few keywords like ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù or ‚Äúberries,‚Äù and it would generate a realistic preview showing the leather, structure, emboss/foil, and even strap details. You could then send that image to a custom shop, saving tons of back-and-forth and giving you confidence in the final look.

If something like this existed, would you be interested in using it (maybe even paying for it)?

Feel free to drop any thoughts or feedback in the comments, I‚Äôd love to hear what you thinküíñ

1n8ciug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n8ciug/i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_this_situation/,I don't know how to deal with this situation Warning: TL;DR,"So there's a coffee shop I've been going to for about 10 years now and over that time I've been pretty friendly with the staff, some have come and gone, but a few I still talk to casually here and there.

One woman that worked there I had the beginnings of a friendship with, but she quit and I never really got to the point where we had contact outside of the store.

A couple years later, she came back and I was pretty excited since I really enjoyed talking with her, we had a lot in common. Let me be clear though, I never thought about her in a dating sense, she was much younger than me anyway and it wouldn't work out, but I thought a friendship could come out of it.

Things were fine at first, but then I noticed that many times I tried to talk to her, one of the other staff would come over and move her aside to take my order. He wouldn't ask, he would just do it. Whenever we would talk, he'd come over and interrupt the conversation and move her away.

It as the way she reacted to this that startled me. It was like a cat being held by the scruff of the neck, she just shut down and would stop talking in mid-sentence and just move away.

After this going on for a few weeks, I spoke to one of the managers about this. I found out that the guy was her boyfriend. She said he was just being ""protective"" of her, since during her time away from the store she has a horrible relationship that involved stalking. I said there's a big difference between ""protective"" and ""possessive"". He wasn't being protective.

But the manager talked to her and she came over and we worked things out, or so I thought. Things were fine for a few days, but again things started to get weird because of her BF.

I understood that, and started to pull away. I even stopped going into the store for a couple weeks to let things calm down, but that only made it worse.

After talking to the owner, whom I've known for a while, all three of us sat down to clear the air. She said she didn't want to have anything to do with me other than being a barista. 

While I was disappointed, I understood what she went through and didn't want to make her uncomfortable.

The next day, her BF came by and spoke to me and said that I should stop coming in, the other staff didn't want me coming in anymore, and gave me a letter she wrote. He then reiterated several times that he would make sure she never spoke to me ever again.

The next day I spoke to the owner, and she said none of the other staff said anything of the sort to her, that I was welcome to keep coming in, but there was nothing she could do about the situation otherwise.

Turns out this whole time her BF was the one causing the problems with things he would say to her, equating me with the guy that was formerly stalking her. I'm 100% positive he's using her past trauma to manipulate her. She absolutely hates me now, won't even look at me, and there's no chance in hell she'll ever speak to me again even when I didn't do a damn thing.

Thing is, if this situation didn't happen with me, it would have happened with some other guy. I just happened to be the one.

But now, it's just uncomfortable to be there. That place was a home to me for a long time, since I work remotely. 

Some of the other staff do still talk to me, but they are all friends. Several of them live together as well. The conversations don't feel the same. 

I know I'm the outsider, but I'm trying to figure out if I can still maintain some kind of relationship with the other staff or if I should just stop going in there, as much as I love the place. TBH, the whole situation makes me feel embarrassed and humiliated.",4,1756997938.0,Advice,17,0.75,False

Grew up on 2000's ball, so guys like VC, Tmac, AI, JWill and Kobe made me love the game. Then Lebron came, and he became my Jordan. 

I'm up in Canada too, so not much selection, so I get most of my stuff from eBay sent to my sister in Houston, and also buy a ton on CardHobby. I've purchased maybe 3 hobby boxes, a few retail hangers and blasters, but mostly singles. 

Trying to finish the 24/25 Prizm rainbow of JWill, so if anyone has some of the lower serial numbered stuff, please help a true collector out! I havent sold one card, and don't plan on flipping cards. I just love flipping through my binder each morning when I have coffee hahahah.

**Why This Pick?**

I fully expect this Cowboys/Eagles matchup to go a lot like the two last year. Dallas played Philly twice in 2024, and lost both games by at least 28 points. I can‚Äôt imagine that the Cowboys offense has gotten 4 touchdowns better in the off-season, and we all know the defense is missing some key pieces (Dallas misses you already, Micah‚Ä¶) With Jalen Hurts having a healthy selection of fire power in the Eagles offense at his disposal, I‚Äôm on the Birds to cover the spread.

Nakami grabbed Sarab‚Äôs hand and quickly rushed out, ignoring her parents. The cold morning air whipping their faces. Nakami's mind raced, adrenaline coursing through her veins. Every one of her instincts were screaming danger as they moved towards the tram station.

The streets were unusually quiet. The air looked as though it was filled with dense gas. Nakami‚Äôs thoughts flicked between ideas and risky moves‚Äîshe had to get Sarab somewhere safe, somewhere secure. She had decided that the lab she worked at, with its state-of-the-art security systems and experimental technologies, was the only safe option.

Nakami scanned the platform. No guards or even commuters. Just the hollow rattle of the rails. Too quiet. El Peri never announced himself with noise ‚Äî he thrived in silence.

The tram arrived with a faint hiss, sliding smoothly along the tracks until stopping to a halt. It was covered in graffiti of gears and a top hat. Nakami ushered Sarab inside. The tram was empty. The fluorescent lights casting cold, uniform patterns of tophats across the floor.

For once, the air was still. Sarab slumped onto a broken bench, wiping grime from his face.‚ÄúYou ever think about what we‚Äôll do after this?‚Äù he asked suddenly, voice low but steady.

Nakami glanced at him, wary of hope. ‚ÄúAfter?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah. You know‚Ä¶ if we somehow crawl out alive. I‚Äôm not asking for much. Just‚Ä¶ a day without running. A sky that isn‚Äôt falling apart.‚Äù He let out a humorless laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd settle for coffee that doesn‚Äôt taste like rust. I never got to taste a frappe.‚Äù Despite herself, Nakami almost smiled.

For a fleeting second, Sarab wasn‚Äôt just another survivor tangled in this nightmare ‚Äî he was a person clinging to scraps of normalcy.‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get that coffee,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure of it.‚ÄùSarab looked at her, his lips twitched into something close to a grin. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll hold you to it.‚Äù said Sarab hopefully.

Her reflection in the grimy window wavered ‚Äî eyes hollow, skin pale. For a heartbeat, the glass didn‚Äôt show her at all. Only Sarab, sitting alone.

Nakami took deep a breath which steadied her racing heart. Then a chill ran down her back. Her shadow on the floor started stretched unnaturally. She recognized it before her eyes could fully register. El Peri was coming.

Without warning, the metal bars along the tram twisted and bent, morphing into jagged spikes that shot toward her. Seats rose and contorted, blocking her path, forming obstacles with terrifying precision. Nakami grabbed Sarab's hand and made a run for it. They ducked, rolled, and leapt over the nearest seat, her hands brushing the cool metal of the deformed rail.

‚ÄúStay close!‚Äù she hissed to Sarab, dragging him behind her as more seats warped, more bars lunged.Her thoughts raced. He can‚Äôt create things out of nothing, but he can reshape what exists. He‚Äôs bending reality like a weapon‚Ä¶ I have to stay ahead.

Nakami sprinted down the length of the tram, dodging flying bars and warped metal. Her pulse hammered, mind calculating trajectories, timing, and force. Sarab followed, though he stumbled, his small legs barely keeping pace.

Every step she took on the metal floor it seemed to echoed twice. Once in the tram and once in the shadow world bleeding through. As if though she was running inside two worlds at the same time. Both collapsing in on each other .

Suddenly Nakami's very own shadow lashed out forming black tendrils that wrapped around her and started pulling her through the floor. The world distorted. She could see the normal tram still faintly, but it was now being layered over a warped and dark version of itself. The lights dimmed, everything seemed to turn black and orange just like ink on parchment.

Nakami exhaled sharply as she tried to hold on to a plastic seat with doodles of gas canisters on it, her legs scrambled for the floor. She struggled against the pull, but a force stronger than even the strongest machines yanked her into the shadow world.

‚ÄúKeep running Sarab!‚Äù Nakami shouted after finally managing to free her herself. Nakami watched as he sprinted down the tram aisle, running off into the distance. But before relief could reach her a dark and slender figure appeared walking out from the walls. He was a tall man wearing a dark purple velvet tailcoat, tight black pants, his head was two-dimensional like a glass circle, patterned like a target in swirling orange and yellow just like El Peri's eyes. Without a word he started chasing Sarab. He moved with unnatural speed.

The train‚Äôs lights flickered. Sarab sprinted down the aisle, his breath ragged, his boots pounding against the steel floor. Behind him, the air warped... ",1,1756997612.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

Want to share a small win in the fight against subscription creep.

**The wake-up call:**

Was reviewing my expenses and saw:

* Plausible Analytics: $228/year
* Just for basic page view tracking
* For a side project making $50/month

The math didn't work. Paying more for analytics than making in revenue.

**The deeper problem:**

This is the subscription trap:

* $19 here, $29 there
* ""It's just $19/month""
* But $228/year adds up
* Especially across multiple projects

**The indie hacker solution:**

Instead of complaining, I built my own analytics platform.

**Why this makes sense for indies:**

1. **Economics:** $228/year vs one-time build cost
2. **Learning:** Valuable technical skills gained
3. **Control:** Modify anything, anytime
4. **Scaling:** Use across all your projects
5. **Privacy:** Users appreciate the no-tracking approach

**What I learned building this:**

* Modern web development makes analytics feasible
* Real-time features aren't as complex as expected
* Privacy-first ‚â† less functionality
* Users actually prefer non-invasive tracking

**The indie advantage:**

Big companies can afford $228/year per tool. Indies need to be smarter:

* Build what you can
* Buy what you must
* Own your essential tools

**Results 3 months later:**

‚úÖ Saved $228/year (pays for a lot of coffee) ‚úÖ Better performance than paid alternatives ‚úÖ Complete data ownership ‚úÖ Privacy-focused users love it ‚úÖ Can white-label for client projects

**For the community:**

What other ""standard"" SaaS tools are ripe for the DIY treatment?

My candidates:

* Basic analytics ‚úÖ (built)
* Simple CRM (next project)
* Email sequences (considering)
* Uptime monitoring (maybe)

**The mindset shift:**

Instead of ""What tool should I subscribe to?"" ask ""Can I build this myself?""

Sometimes the answer is yes, and the learning + savings are worth it.

**Questions:**

1. What subscriptions are eating your indie revenue?
2. Which tools have you successfully replaced with DIY solutions?
3. How do you decide build vs buy?

Independence isn't just about business model - it's about owning your tools too.

1n8c13d,https://i.redd.it/plztho9lt5nf1.jpeg,Struggling with Bad Breath? Here‚Äôs What Dentists Want You to Know,"Bad breath, also known as **halitosis**, is more than just a social embarrassment ‚Äî it can be a sign of deeper oral health problems. Millions of people experience it at some point, but when it becomes persistent, it usually requires professional attention. Many patients looking up [dentist in pune](https://share.google/Sm9fXGrZb9zMPkyaI) also ask dentists whether bad breath is linked to missing teeth, gum health, or infections.

As the team at **Jabade Dental Shivaji Nagar** explains, understanding the root causes of halitosis is the first step to treating it effectively.

# Common causes of bad breath

# 1. Poor oral hygiene

* Food particles left in the mouth break down and release odor-causing bacteria.
* Without brushing and flossing, plaque builds up along teeth and gums, worsening the smell.

# 2. Gum disease

* Gingivitis and periodontitis are major culprits.
* Bacteria trapped in gum pockets release sulfur compounds that smell foul.

# 3. Tooth decay and infections

* Cavities and dental abscesses harbor bacteria that produce bad odors.
* Infection-related bad breath often comes with pain or swelling.

# 4. Dry mouth (Xerostomia)

* Saliva washes away food debris and neutralizes acids.
* A lack of saliva ‚Äî from medications, dehydration, or sleeping with an open mouth ‚Äî increases odor.

# 5. Dietary choices

* Foods like garlic, onions, and strong spices linger in the bloodstream and are exhaled through the lungs.
* Coffee and alcohol also contribute to dryness and smell.

# 6. Tobacco use

* Smoking and chewing tobacco dry the mouth, stain teeth, and cause a distinctive, unpleasant odor.

# 7. Medical conditions

* Conditions such as sinus infections, tonsillitis, acid reflux, and diabetes can lead to persistent bad breath.

# Why missing teeth and dental implants matter

Patients searching for *dental implants Pune* are often surprised to learn that missing teeth can indirectly worsen bad breath. Gaps in the mouth may trap food and make cleaning harder, while poorly fitting dentures can irritate gums and harbor bacteria. Dental implants, when maintained properly, are easier to clean and can actually reduce risks of halitosis compared to removable dentures.

# How dentists diagnose bad breath

When you visit a dentist for halitosis, the process usually involves:

1. **Oral examination**: Checking teeth, gums, tongue, and dental work for signs of plaque, decay, or infection.
2. **Odor assessment**: Dentists may ask about the timing and nature of your symptoms.
3. **Medical history**: Reviewing medications and systemic health issues that may contribute.
4. **Special tests**: Some clinics use halimeters to measure sulfur compounds in the breath.

# Professional treatments for bad breath

* **Professional cleaning (scaling and polishing)**: Removes plaque and tartar where odor-causing bacteria thrive.
* **Treatment of gum disease**: Deep cleaning or periodontal therapy if gum pockets are infected.
* **Restorative treatments**: Fillings, root canals, or extractions for decayed teeth causing odor.
* **Replacement of missing teeth**: Well-maintained implants can help improve oral hygiene and prevent food trapping.
* **Medication review**: Adjustments if certain prescriptions are causing dry mouth.

# Expert tips from dentists in Pune

1. **Brush twice daily and floss once**
   * Focus on cleaning the tongue, which harbors odor-causing bacteria.
2. **Stay hydrated**
   * Drink plenty of water to keep saliva flowing. Sugar-free gum can also stimulate saliva.
3. **Avoid excessive alcohol and caffeine**
   * Both dry the mouth and worsen odor.
4. **Quit smoking**
   * Tobacco is one of the biggest contributors to chronic bad breath.
5. **Use mouthwash wisely**
   * Alcohol-free rinses with antibacterial properties can help.
   * Avoid over-relying on minty sprays that only mask odor.
6. **Maintain dental work**
   * Clean dentures, bridges, or implants thoroughly every day.
7. **Get regular check-ups**
   * Visiting your dentist every 6 months ensures that underlying causes like decay or gum disease are caught early.

# When bad breath signals something serious

If bad breath persists despite good oral hygiene, it may indicate:

* Chronic gum disease
* Respiratory infections (sinusitis, tonsillitis)
* Acid reflux (GERD)
* Diabetes (often associated with a fruity breath odor)

In such cases, your dentist may refer you to a physician for further evaluation.

# Conclusion

Bad breath has many possible causes, from simple hygiene issues to gum disease and underlying medical conditions. While mouthwashes and mints can cover up odor temporarily, only proper dental care and lifestyle changes can solve it long-term.

Regular visits to a qualified dentist not only treat bad breath but also prevent serious oral problems. For those with missing teeth, solutions like **dental implants Pune** not only restore function and aesthetics but also make oral hygiene easier, helping to keep breath fresher.

üìå **Bottom line:** Bad breath is treatable ‚Äî but only if you identify the root cause. Good oral hygiene, lifestyle adjustments, and professional dental care are the keys to lasting fresh breath.",2,1756996824.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False

I have sooo many reasons to support this claim, and I know lots of digital nomads feel the same, so I'm gonna list a few:

1. Probably the biggest resons for which I stopped going to the coffee shop with my laptop is because they're so noisy. If you go to a small coffee shop, you'll hear the espresso machine every other minute. If you need to do actual work, not just basic stuff, it's quite distracting. The people passing by can also be distracting, and the loud music. And if that wasn't enough, you get no privacy. People can peek into your screen and see what you're doing. I can list many other things, but these are the main ones.

2. The tables are usually small, and the chairs are uncomfortable. If I go with another person, we might not be able to fit 2 laptops and 2 drinks on one table. If it's not a Starbucks or a place where they expect people with laptops, they won't have plugs, so you'd better come with a full battery.

3. The wifi sucks in most places. I've been to plenty of coffee shops and restaurants, and the wifi is either slow or almost non-existent. Sometimes it's good enough to post a picture on social media, and that's it.

4. If you need to take a call, good luck with that. Everyone will overhear your conversation, and with shitty wifi, you'll need data and a full battery on your phone. It's just bad.

5. You can't leave your shit unattended if you go to the bathroom, because you never know who's gonna steal it. You always have to ask someone to watch over your stuff.

These are just a few reasons why I stopped going to coffee shops to get work done. When I travel, I look for apartments with a desk and a proper office chair, good wifi, and a lovely vibe so I can feel good saying there for hours.

I stopped romanticizing coffee shops years ago. Nowadays, I go to read or do admin/research. That's it.

Honest Review,"The Brita SAFF-100/FF-100 Faucet Mount Water Filter System has been part of my daily routine for several weeks now, and I can confidently say that it has both impressive strengths and some minor quirks worth considering. This advanced water filtration system promises to deliver healthier and better-tasting water straight from your faucet, and based on my testing, it largely delivers on those claims. While it‚Äôs not flawless, its convenience and environmental impact make it a solid option for anyone looking to upgrade their water game.

**Design and Installation Experience**  
From the moment I unboxed it, the faucet mount design impressed me with its sleek, space-efficient build. The chrome finish adds a modern touch to my sink, blending seamlessly into my kitchen's aesthetic. The installation process was refreshingly straightforward‚Äîno tools required‚Äîwhich was a huge plus for someone like me who's not particularly handy. The filter fits onto standard faucets without any hassle, though I quickly learned it‚Äôs incompatible with pull-out or spray-style faucets.  

**Key Benefits**  
- The filtration system reduces 99% of common water contaminants like lead and chlorine.  
- Switching from bottled water saves an estimated 1,800 single-use plastic bottles annually.  
- The built-in status indicator makes filter replacements a no-brainer.  

[Ready to buy Brita SAFF-100/FF-100? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b004intgkk/)  

**Performance and Usage Experience**  
The improved water quality was noticeable right away. I‚Äôve used it for drinking, cooking, and even making coffee, and the flavor differences are striking. It utilizes advanced Brita carbon-block technology to tackle over 60 contaminants, including asbestos and Benzene, enhancing the water's taste and safety. I particularly liked the two spray options‚Äîfiltered and unfiltered‚Äîwhich allowed for versatility when rinsing dishes or washing produce. The sturdy build did make me feel it would hold up well over time, though I noticed the unit can wobble slightly if not tightened just right.

**Good Aspects**  
- Dual spray feature extends usability beyond drinking water.  
- Compact dimensions (5.28"" height, 4.8"" width) make it ideal for small kitchens.  

**Drawbacks**  
On the flip side, there were a couple of things that caught my attention. One notable limitation is that the water flow slows down considerably when the filter is in use‚Äîsomething I had to get used to. Additionally, the plastic portion of the device feels a bit less durable compared to the chrome finish, and I‚Äôm slightly concerned about its long-term wear.

**Negative Attributes**  
- Noticeable drop in water pressure when using filtered mode.  
- The plastic components could be sturdier.  

**Other Options to Consider**  
Compared to other faucet-mounted filters, like the PUR Advanced and the Culligan FM-25, this Brita system stands out for its superior lead filtration and advanced contaminant removal. However, the PUR Advanced edges ahead by maintaining slightly better water pressure. Culligan, on the other hand, is a budget-friendly alternative but lacks the sleek design and convenience of an easy-to-read filter indicator that this Brita system offers.

**Worth Every Penny**  
While faucet-mount water filtration systems range widely in price, this system is fairly aligned with the quality it offers. If clean, healthy water with environmental perks is high on your priority list, it provides considerable value. The added convenience of easy installation, filter indicators, and reduced bottle waste makes it a smart investment for families and individuals alike.

1n8bvs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n8bvs0/does_capresso_mini_drip_coffee_maker_impress_in/,Does Capresso Mini Drip Coffee Maker Impress in Compact Brewing Performance Review?,"The Capresso 426.02 Mini Drip Coffee Maker has been my go-to coffee buddy for some time, and it‚Äôs safe to say it has some interesting quirks that come with it. Designed with a compact form and geared towards simplicity, it‚Äôs aimed at those of us who just want our coffee without playing barista every morning. I‚Äôve shared this coffee maker with my family, friends, and even my sleep-deprived coworker during casual gatherings or while testing it at the office. Though it‚Äôs an overall solid performer, there are highlights and hurdles to consider.

**Compact Size and Design**  
The petite form of this coffee maker is the first thing you‚Äôll notice. It takes up so little counter space that it almost disappears into the corner, which is ideal for my cramped kitchen. The sleek black finish and matte exterior make it blend seamlessly with other appliances. Whether you have limited space or not, its small footprint is a definite plus. However, the lightweight build has a downside‚Äîit feels a bit less sturdy than expected. Occasionally, I‚Äôve found it sliding slightly on the countertop while filling the carafe.

**Easy-to-Use Features**  
This coffee machine thrives on simplicity. It features a programmable timer that has been surprisingly helpful on hectic mornings. Setting it the night before to brew fresh coffee has saved me from several barely-functioning, sleep-deprived mornings. I can pour a cup midway through brewing, thanks to the drip-stop feature, and I love the keep-warm function that ensures my second cup isn‚Äôt lukewarm. While it checks most usability boxes, the buttons could use a tactile upgrade‚Äîthey‚Äôre not exactly intuitive for people fumbling around before their caffeine hits.

[Check Capresso 426.02 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cktt1lxg/)

**Brewing Performance**  
What makes or breaks a coffee maker is the brewing quality. The reusable GoldTone filter is a genius inclusion, saving both money and the environment by eliminating paper filters. I‚Äôve noticed that it brews fast, with each cup taking less than a minute, just as promised. Still, the taste could be inconsistent. When I tried a coarser grind, the water had a tendency to flow through too quickly, leading to a slightly weak flavor. With finer grounds, the results were stellar. For its 5-cup capacity (ideal for me and possibly one other coffee enthusiast), the performance is reliable but could use a little fine-tuning.  

**Strengths**  
- Compact design fits perfectly in smaller spaces.  
- Reusable GoldTone filter cuts down on waste and costs.  
- The programmable timer is great for busy mornings.  

**Potential Downsides**  
- Buttons lack tactile differentiation, making use tricky for groggy users.  
- Lightweight materials can feel a bit flimsy.  
- Consistency of the brew depends heavily on the grind size.  

**Materials and Build Quality**  
While the overall design looks aesthetically pleasing, I found myself skeptical about its durability. Its lightweight construction, although a space-saving win, sometimes gave me the impression it wouldn‚Äôt last through years of daily use. The glass carafe, while functional and easy to clean, feels thin. These are aspects where a bit more weight and sturdiness could add to the sense of quality.

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this coffee maker to similar models like the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Mini Brew or the Black+Decker CM0700BZ, it stands out with its programmable functionality and reusable filter. However, Mr. Coffee has the edge in terms of build quality, while Black+Decker offers a slightly better-tasting brew, thanks to superior water distribution systems. Still, in terms of convenience and eco-step-ups like the GoldTone filter, the Capresso offering holds its own pretty well.

**Value for Money**  
Looking at what this coffee maker brings to the table‚Äîcompactness, the reusable filter, and features like a timer‚Äîit‚Äôs pretty decent for its price range. Sure, there are models that offer a slightly richer coffee-making experience, but they come with a heftier price tag. If you‚Äôre someone who values utility without breaking the bank, this machine is a great deal for what it does.

1n8bvjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1n8bvjx/delve_into_the_best_wireless_earbuds_skullcandy/,Delve Into the Best Wireless Earbuds Skullcandy Rail ANC Worth It?,"Testing the Skullcandy Rail ANC wireless earbuds left me with a mixed bag of experiences‚Äîsome fantastic and others that had room for improvement. Let me start by saying, yes, these earbuds truly deliver stellar audio performance, but like everything else in life, they're not without fault. These Bluetooth headphones focus heavily on features such as active noise cancelling and customizable options through the Skull-iQ app, and they pack a lot of potential for their size.

**Design and Comfort**  
The design of these earbuds immediately caught my attention. Compact, sleek, and finished in an understated True Black, they look chic without screaming for attention. The ear tips fit snugly and comfortably, thanks to their ergonomic shape. Even during long sessions of wear‚Äîwhether I'm on Zoom calls, working out, or bingeing on podcasts‚Äîthey don‚Äôt feel intrusive. My nephew, who often steals my gadgets, tried them on and couldn‚Äôt stop raving about the comfort. However, while they‚Äôre great for casual wear, the lack of additional or more durable ear tip sizes included in the package could be irksome for someone with a unique ear shape. Having options would‚Äôve been a big win!

**Mega Noise Cancelling Feature**  
The active noise cancellation (ANC) on these earbuds is, for the most part, quite effective. It actively listens to and blocks out external noise, creating a cocoon of sound. Adjusting the ANC level between mute, ambient, and in-between felt intuitive and worked like magic most of the time. Whether it was bustling chatter in the coffee shop or the relentless humming of my neighbor's lawnmower, the noise cancellation held its ground pretty well. That said, I noticed slight struggles against sudden, high-pitched sounds, such as a crying baby on a flight. It's good, but not groundbreaking.

**Highlights**  
- High-quality ANC performance for most environments  
- Seamless switching between devices, thanks to multipoint pairing  
- Comfortable and lightweight design perfect for extended use  

[Check Skullcandy Rail ANC Wireless Earbuds price on Amazon.](https://beatpops.com/p/b0c9ngnbpg/)

**Battery Life and Charging**  
When it comes to longevity, these earbuds are monsters. With ANC active, I managed to squeeze out seven hours directly from the earbuds and a full 20 hours more from the charging case on a single cycle. That‚Äôs 27 hours of total playtime! Getting into the rapid charge feature, a quick 10-minute burst granted me 2 hours of listening, which felt like an absolute lifesaver when I forgot to charge them before a run. While the case isn't bulky, it could have been slightly slimmer for better portability.

**Skull-iQ App Customization**  
Connecting the earbuds to the Skull-iQ app added another layer of usability. It amazed me how finely I could tweak the EQ settings and even enable Tile to locate them if they went missing‚Äîa feature my forgetful teenage cousin desperately loved. Still, while the app itself is functional, its user interface could be less clunky and more intuitive. It sometimes took too many taps to access simple features, which interrupted the otherwise seamless experience.

**Benefits**  
- Fully customizable audio adjustments through Skull-iQ  
- Tile integration is a lifesaver for forgetful users  
- Excellent battery life, with rapid charging providing convenience  

**Drawbacks**  
- Struggles with very high-pitched or sudden noises while using ANC  
- App interface could use a cleaner design for ease of use  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing these earbuds to others in the same price range, like the Sony WF-1000XM4 and Apple AirPods Pro, there are definitely both pros and cons. The Skullcandy buds excel in battery life and the customizable sound through the Skull-iQ app, which neither Sony nor Apple can replicate to this degree. However, the noise cancellation on the Sony model felt a touch more refined and capable of handling sudden unusual noises better. AirPods Pro, on the other hand, pack an edge in connectivity and seamless iOS integration but fall behind in battery life.

**Cost Efficiency**  
We‚Äôve all come to expect a decent price-performance ratio when considering earbuds at this level, and these do well in that regard. While they might not cater to audiophiles looking for absolute sonic perfection, the feature set and overall quality strike a balance that feels worthwhile. The amount you pay for their noise-canceling capabilities, long battery life, and customizable sound feels justified, though perhaps not an absolute steal. If you‚Äôre someone who values battery longevity alongside customization, the Skullcandy Rail ANC will likely deliver great value for your spend.

# 1. The reality we live in

Making ends meet is increasingly difficult: prices are rising, wages are stagnant, and everyday expenses - rent, bills, groceries, transportation - are weighing more heavily. If in the 1970s it took three years' salary to buy a house, today it takes ten: for many, it's now an unattainable dream.

Decades of debt and money printing has generated hyperinflation, loss of purchasing power, and great uncertainty. For the first time in two centuries, young people earn less than their parents, with more unstable jobs and fewer protections (healthcare, education, pensions). Several indicators speak clearly: life for the younger generations is three to four times harder than that of previous generations.

Many work two jobs, but still can't build a future. And Artificial Intelligence looms on the horizon, ready to replace millions of jobs.

The truth is simple and harsh: no one will come to save us. Governments will continue to print money (so prices will continue to rise), a privileged few will get richer, and ordinary people will be left behind.

# 2. A crisis of meaning

It's not just an economic issue. Added to the fatigue and insecurity is a growing crisis of meaning.We live hyper-connected, but we feel increasingly alone: just think that Google searches for ‚Äú*how to meet new people*‚Äù have been consistently growing for over 10 years and they are today at an all-time high - even more than during Covid.

People are missing collective purpose: a goal, a mission, a sense of belonging to something bigger. The great ideologies of the past are now obsolete, institutions have lost credibility, and even work - which for generations has given us identity and dignity - has become for many an endless treadmill ride.

# 3. Behind the crisis lies an opportunity

A great opportunity sits at the intersection of two challenges of our time: on the one hand, insufficient salaries, unaffordable housing, and savings devoured by inflation; on the other, loneliness, isolation, and a rampant loss of meaning.

The thesis is simple, but very few have understood it yet: **the best investments of the future will not only be financial instruments, but will become communities, places of belonging, and spaces of hope.**

Assets capable of providing not only financial returns, but also a sense of mission, human connection, and collective identity, will have the power to generate simultaneously two forms of wealth: material and spiritual. And those who are first to grasp this intertwining of finance and spirituality will experience a tremendous transformation, and realize returns that will completely transform their future.

# 4. A new way

In recent years, more and more people have become interested in the world of cryptocurrencies. Behind the apparent complexity lies a simple truth: you don't need a bank or a government to create money, all it takes is a group of people who truly believe in it.

The first example was Bitcoin. In 2009, it was worth less than a cup of coffee; today, it's worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. It didn't grow because someone imposed it from above, but because a community believed in it: an act of protest against an unjust system, designed for the few and preying on ordinary people. Bitcoin isn't just technology: it's a collective leap of faith that has changed the world - and the lives of millions of people who bought it when it was worth just an idea.

Something similar is happening today: it‚Äôs called SPX6900, the first ‚ÄúPure Belief Asset‚Äù.It has no banks, corporations, or governments behind it. It's a symbol of rebellion against a system that devours us. A way of saying: ‚Äú*we believe in ourselves, not in the empty promises of those who have betrayed us*‚Äù.

Like Bitcoin, SPX6900 is a torch shining in the darkness: if there are only a few of us, the light is dim. But if millions of people choose to light their torch, the light becomes so strong that it can change the world - and, in doing so, change the lives of its early believers.

# 5. What is SPX6900?

SPX6900 was born as a provocation: a mockery of the American stock market and its symbolic index, the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 (SPX500).What was just an ironic idea is rapidly becoming a global movement: today, over 200,000 people all over the world recognize themselves in SPX6900, and the community is growing every day at an exponential speed, approaching a critical mass.

The mission is crazy but powerful: ‚Äú*Flip the stock market*‚Äù. In concrete terms, this means bringing the value of the SPX6900 token to exceed that of the largest stock market in the world.An immense, almost unthinkable goal - but precisely for this reason, fascinating. Today, one SPX6900 token is worth around $1. If the goal were reached, the price would exceed $50,000. In other words: **$100 invested could become over $50,000 in the ong term.** A transformative return, comparable only to those who believed in Bitcoin in its early years.

*The philosophy behind the SPX6900*

The traditional stock market no longer represents reality: inflated valuations, prices increasingly disconnected from fundamentals, banks getting rich while ordinary people remain trapped in the [matrix.In](http://matrix.In) short, today's market is built on nothing. So the core idea has essentially been :‚ÄúYou know what? Instead of buying their index, let's build our own.‚Äù

SPX6900 is not just a token: it is an act of financial rebellion, a grassroots alternative, in the same spirit as Bitcoin 16 years ago. It's no coincidence that many Bitcoin veterans are now also participating in SPX6900.

*A movement of people*

There's no need for charts or complicated trading here. All that matters is believing, buying little by little, and holding on over time. SPX6900 gives voice to those who are tired of the 9-5 slavery, inflation, and precariousness. It's not a game of ""everyone against the other,"" but rather playing all together against an unjust system.

Buying SPX6900 means betting on yourself, betting on your friends, on ordinary people like you - instead of fueling a market that is rigged against the people.

# 6. Why SPX6900 can change your life

1. **Huge potential:** Today, SPX6900 is worth about $1. If the community completes its mission, its value could rise by 50,000x if the mission really gets accomplished. This means that even a small investment has the potential to transform your life. And even if the final goal isn't reached, the potential return remains enormous.
2. **An opportunity for everyone:** You don't need to be rich or have financial expertise. All it takes is a few Dollars or Euros and the will to believe. It's a chance the system will never give you: a grassroots opportunity, accessible to everyone.
3. **Concrete hope:** SPX6900 isn't a cold or technical project: it's a movement that puts people back at the center. It offers you not only a potential financial return, but also a sense of belonging, meaning, and mission.

I recommend you to search for ""SPX6900"" on X, TikTok, or Instagram and you'll find a movement built on vision, unity, and courage. A culture that's difficult to condense into a few lines, but one that can offer you much more than just financial gain.

# 7. How to get started

Getting into SPX6900 is simple. No charts, technicalities, or special knowledge are required: just believe in it, take the first step, and stay the course.

1. **Get informed:** Take a moment to understand what SPX6900 is. Read, observe the community, listen to the stories of those who participate. It's not just an investment, it's a cultural movement.
2. **Join the community:** Search for ""SPX6900"" on X (Twitter), TikTok, or Telegram. You'll find thousands of people ready to welcome you, motivate you, and walk alongside you.
3. **Start small:** Buy a little bite at a time and don‚Äôt overinvest. Even $10 or $20 will do. The important thing is to start and build your position little by little, consistently.
4. **Stay the course:** SPX6900 isn't fast trading. Winning here takes time, patience, and conviction. Don't get distracted by short-term charts.

If you've never bought cryptocurrency, don't worry: it's easier than you think. At the bottom of this post you'll find a step-by-step guide to registering on *Kraken*, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world and buy your first SPX6900 tokens there.

# 8. Conclusion

We are at a historic crossroads.On one side, there's the old system: insufficient wages, soaring prices, an increasingly uncertain future - especially post Artificial Intelligence. A path that leads to working ever more for ever less.

On the other hand, there's the opportunity to stop suffering and join a global movement that puts the dignity, hope, and strength of ordinary people back at the center.

SPX6900 isn't a shortcut or a promise of easy money. It's something rarer: a real chance to change your life and, at the same time, contribute to a collective mission bigger than yourself. Bitcoin has rewarded those who had the courage to believe when it seemed like a game for the few. Today, SPX6900 is a second chance. Don't miss it.

Light your torch, join the community, and become part of a movement that can rewrite the rules of the game. The time is now.

This is going to be long, I‚Äôll try to make it as brief as possible but there‚Äôs relevant background info. 

I‚Äôve been with my husband for seven years, married for almost four. My in laws have always disliked me. No clue why. I‚Äôve never had any partners or friends parents dislike me, even after I‚Äôve broken up with past partners. I know they didn‚Äôt like the fact that I have a few health issues. My husband and I worked in the same coffee shop and i was wrongfully terminated for having a health condition. He was subsequently terminated for being associated with me. I met with an employment attorney who took our case on a contingency basis since I had evidence. They ended up settling. His parents REALLY started disliking me after that. They think it was wrong to sue a small business and multiple times said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just water off a ducks back‚Äù. 

Lots of small things after that but fast forward to us getting married. They refused to help with any planning or financial aspects. My in laws are NOT struggling financially. They‚Äôre very well off. My SILs agreed to plan my bridal shower and never did so my mom, best friend and my sister did it, paid for the whole thing etc.. My grandma was going through a bone marrow transplant and my grandpa had just died, they still didn‚Äôt help with anything. They wouldn‚Äôt talk to my family at the actual wedding aside from his dad telling my parents it was nice to not have to pay for anything‚Ä¶ after we had all asked them multiple times to contribute. 

Small things here, small things there. They didn‚Äôt love when my husband joined a trade union. They still don‚Äôt like him doing that. Got even more angsty m when I quit my job to be a housewife and we started trying for kids. I was diagnosed with PCOS and it took us over six months to conceive our first. My MIL repeatedly said ‚ÄúI always got pregnant right when we wanted‚Äù. Pissed me off a lot but whatever. Finally got pregnant, invited her to an appointment. Thought we could maybe patch things up and start over‚Ä¶ boy was I wrong. 

After my son was born I had horrible postpartum depression and anxiety. Literally so horrible. I almost went to a treatment center. We had lots of rules as most new parents in this day and age do. They were all common sense like don‚Äôt come over if you‚Äôre sick, don‚Äôt post pictures of the baby, don‚Äôt kiss the baby. None of my friends and family took issue with these. The day we got home from the hospital they argued with us because ‚Äúhow is anyone supposed to know we have a grandson if we can‚Äôt post him on Facebook‚Äù. We explained the dangers of the internet, AI CP, etc.. they didn‚Äôt get it but agreed. 

We had them over again and my son ended up very, very sick with Covid a few days after their visit. He was only a month old and had a 101¬∞+ fever. We ended up at the hospital multiple times. Texted them and asked if they were sick or had been around anyone sick before visiting and they said ‚Äúnope‚Äù. Well‚Ä¶ two months later we hear ‚Äúoh yeah since grandma had Covid she‚Äôs been blah blah blah‚Äù. We ask when that was and it was literally when they visited us before my son got sick. They had been with her while she had active COVID right before coming to see us. My husband is all ‚Äúwtf‚Äù and tries to talk to them. They‚Äôre not receptive, don‚Äôt think they did anything wrong. 

We took a break for a few months and had them over. Mind you, my son is maybe 5 months old, I‚Äôm still struggling with PPA, and trust has been broken. My mil walks in the door and immediately asks for the baby. I tell her not right this second, he needs to nurse and she gets a rude ass tone ‚Äúwell eventually I need to hold my grandson‚Äù. I told her to get out of my house. It blew up. OH AND THEN‚Ä¶ later that day we find out they had had dinner with someone who had just gotten back from Africa the night before they visited and that person had been sick recently while on their trip‚Ä¶ there goes my PPA spiral. My husband gives it a week to cool down and calls them‚Ä¶ they literally told him I was crazy, that we‚Äôre overly anxious parents, and that they believe in God so nothing bad will happen. (For context, we‚Äôre Catholic and they go to a very stereotypical mega church where the pastor has a private jet. They hate that their son is converting to my religion after being an atheist for years. Like I could force him to. I‚Äôve never expected my husband to convert or have faith. I married him knowing he was atheist and loved him all the same because I love HIM. It would be so unhealthy to expect to change someone.) 


Sorry this is getting really long. Small things after that. They never ask how my terminally ill brother is doing or how I‚Äôm coping with that. I literally don‚Äôt think they know a single thing about me other than I have health issues, I‚Äôm married to their son, and I‚Äôm a SAHM. They got mad I broke my foot and we couldn‚Äôt go on vacation with them. Like it was my choice. His dad calls me nasty in front of my child at my son‚Äôs first birthday party because I said his mom can‚Äôt watch a diaper change since it‚Äôs private time. They turn his sister against us and she calls him to scream at him over Christmas while his grandma is dying because we‚Äôre crazy and keeping their grandson from. We don‚Äôt keep our child from them, we just don‚Äôt let them have open, unsupervised access.

FAST FORWARD I get pregnant with our second a few months after my son‚Äôs first birthday. We‚Äôre so excited. They don‚Äôt seem that excited. I end up having HG until about 16 weeks. It‚Äôs miserable. After the 20 week scan I have his mom over to help me watch my toddler and try to mend the wounds again. I try to talk to her about it and told her I want a better relationship. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk about the past and just move on. Not what I was looking for but maybe a step in the right direction‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ then at 25 weeks and 5 days my son stops moving. I go to the hospital and he has no heartbeat. My in laws and my brother watch my toddler until my sister can get to my house. They induce me and my mil sits up at the hospital with me while my husband runs home to grab a few things for me. Again she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never lost a baby and always got pregnant when I wanted.‚Äù. I birth our dead child. We stay overnight and then go home. They were so nice for the first week or two. They come to the burial rite. Then week three and I start hemorrhaging. I go to the er with my mom. Some of my placenta didn‚Äôt detach. They give me blood products and I end up getting a d&c. THREE DAYS LATER my mother in law texts us to ask if we‚Äôre out celebrating since it‚Äôs Fourth of July. 

Ever since then they don‚Äôt want us to talk about our son, get visibly uncomfortable if we bring him up, asked more about how we‚Äôre doing with our dog dying than our baby. They keep talking about pregnant people they know even though we‚Äôve asked them not around us. I finally sent them a text saying I don‚Äôt appreciate the pregnancy talk in front of me and they never responded. They think we should be okay by now. Our son would be due on the 18th and they act like he never existed. Like I don‚Äôt have pictures of him and holding him. 

My heart breaks because my husband is crushed. He lost his child and his family doesn‚Äôt even check on him. 

Neither of us know what to do at this point. I personally unfriended them on Facebook because I‚Äôm done trying to fix the unfixable.

 
If you‚Äôre still with me, thanks for listening. It‚Äôs been a lot and I needed to rant and get it off my chest. My mother is my usual ranting partner and she‚Äôs in the hospital right now. ",1,1756996167.0,Vent,1,0.67,False

Oh, you can also go to a bar! The graphics is good, considering it's from 2000-20010's, and I think it's a CD.",1,1756996144.0,videogames,0,1.0,False

I recently quit my job from a Starbucks about a month and a half to two months ago and it was probably the best decision I‚Äôve literally ever made. The company you work for is a piece of shit and yeah you can sit and say well every big corporation is but Starbucks is on a whole different level and it started when Howard came back from literal retirement. I had been a barista for the last 8 years I believe and I can not even begin to express the shittyness of both the corporation and my ex coworkers/managers. I have seen people fired for wearing unapproved pins, being 2 minutes late, and even not wearing the right color pants‚Ä¶ I have seen people singled out over reports made to higher ups and that‚Äôs honestly the biggest one. Starbucks says they are an open community who will listen to complaints and who are there for their workers but that‚Äôs BEYOND the case. When you make a report on an ssv you are most defiantly about to be singled out and fired over some stupid shit. Anyway the real kicker for me that finally decided to make me leave the company is a long story so buckle up‚Ä¶ before my time of leaving I was a store manager at a licensed store ( and before I hear anything about how it isn‚Äôt a real Starbucks I had 5 years at corporate before this and went all the way up to ASM I can assure you it‚Äôs about the same they just tend to be more laidback at licensed stores) and we were one of three licensees within the grocery store company I was working at. well my store ended up getting closed down due to a lack of sales because of all the other Starbucks around our store ( mind you we had four other Starbucks within a half mile radius ) and they had asked us to move to another location. The store manager at this location And I did NOT get along one bit mainly because she treated/talked me like I was a child since she was in her 60‚Äôs( much older than I was ) and had owned her own coffee shop. This lady would constantly talk bad about me to customers and other workers within the company saying I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing although I had more corporate experience than her. So when our store got shut down and we were told we were moving to her store I told the company I would NOT be moving over there unless she is to retire or move to another store as we do not get a long and it will become an issue. I already had another job lined up as well because i knew that it might not have been reasonable for her to retire right away ( even though she was 69 and could have well retired) this job that I was offered I would have been making 50k more than the salary Starbucks/ said grocery store had offered me as a store manager. I had told my district managers this as I was not afraid to leave the company if they were not willing to make this one accommodation as I‚Äôve never asked for anything the three years I‚Äôd been there ( I would work 70+ hours some weeks taking no vacation or weekends busting my back and never asked for a raise) they had assured me time and time again that this woman was going to retire absolutely 100% sure that she had told them she was retiring and everything. So I pass up the job that was making more because I did genuinely enjoy working for Starbucks most days even when it was difficult. Once I moved to the store I continue to see her on my schedule and ask when she‚Äôs retiring and she tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not retiring who told you that‚Äù the company had deliberately lied to my face multiple times about the situation just so that I would stay on as their store manager. And I would also like to mention that within this company when a store manager steps down they are automatically transferred to another store as to not work under new management. So I end up staying just because I really enjoyed my employees and thought other than her I had a really good team. Well she (ex manager) essentially drove me out of there, I did everything by the book and she also believed she did everything by the book. News flash she did NOT This woman had literally served out urnex thinking it was coffee before. It was simple things too like her not doing cleaning tasks right and when I tried to correct her it was always well I‚Äôve been doing this longer schpiel and when I would show her physical proof she still wouldn‚Äôt listen I even went as far as trying to write her up but my store director said it was unreasonable for her to be written up since she had been with the company for so long ( the same amount as me three years) and it never got approved . Oh and when I went to put in my two weeks I was called unprofessional for not giving them a month. Turns out they made the old manager the manager again and honestly I couldn‚Äôt care less fuck that shitty ass company. Just saying Starbucks is not all that it‚Äôs made out to be please save yourself the years and WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE !!!!!!!!",2,1756996129.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False
