I came home Friday night (I'm in college, 19) and my brother (17 basically 18) had just gotten home from the hospital for a head injury and a sprained ankle so some limitations were put like don't watch TV to loud don't have people over. Even though the only things he needs to do are sleep, eat, take meds, repeat.

Dad worked Sunday and Mom had to go out of town so she left me and my brother and told me to watch him. After 3 hours of just him sleeping in the dark living room, I left his meds and a snack and some water on the coffee table and went to go meet up with my friends and vape which I also can't do at home.

My mom was angry even though when she got home he was in the exact same damn place as when I left him. Since then she's saying in irresponsible and won't let up about it. I'm back at college for a week (maybe two as I don't think I feel like going home for a while) and blocked all of them because I shouldn't have to babysit my grown brother when he literally isn't doing anything.

My own life is stressful and I think I was justified to have a few hours to myself. And again, HE WAS FINE.

Whenever i brew them, i always get this sort of muted 'roundness' that is more like a sweet chocolate, and not acidic or bright in any way. I've tried a yellow honey Costa Rica that was described as juicy and citrusy, tried a washed peruvian that described green apple and citrus, and now i just bought another washed ethiopian from a different roaster, that noted lime and peach. And they all taste kinda the same?   
  
I absolutely adore a bright and fresh coffee, and i lot that tangy acidity that is found in citrus and green fruits. 

Help me fix this, please!

 \- zp6 grinder and a K-ultra, no luck with either 

\- Cafec Abaca filter 

\- Fellow Stagg EGK 

\- Demineralized water with lotus drops added, used both the ""light and bright"" and the ""Simple and sweet"" recipe 

\- Hario switch, used as a V60, only keeping the switch closed for the first 10 seconds during the bloom to make sure that all grounds are wet 



I am very well versed in coffee and pour over in general, and feel like i have a lot of experience, but i've tried absolutely everything to fix this, but nothing seems to give.   
  
Tried every grind setting on both the ZP6 and k-ultra, from the extreme fine to extreme coarse, tried every temp of water, from 80 to 100 degrees, tried lots of agitation and no agitation, long blooms and short blooms, different water recipes, drinking it hot and cold after brewing etc etc.   
  
Please help me, i just want to feel the battery acid eat away my enamel, and i've spent to much on beans that end up not really tasting very good. The only time i've really felt some good acidity is if i buy some washed Kenya SL28.

You guys you guys you guys!!! 

I can't even REMEMBER being in the 150s. I remember being 145 in late-highschool, and then packing on the freshman 15 at uni, being around 160 in my 20s, and then slaloming into the 170s in my 20s. 

Over pandemic I topped out at 185 lbs and 5'2"". I DREAMED of 150 but I thought it was impossible. Everything hurt and I never exercised.

I am an older millenial (old as the hills) and I thought my slow slide into MY 600 Pound Life was inevitable. I was just getting fatter and fatter over the decades and I thought they'd have to roll me into my grave.

So at some point in pandemic I decided to live for myself. I got put on a med that suppresses appetite. I dealt with some very deep trauma that didn't specifically have to do with weight, but was motivating comfort-eating.

I made a few very specific eating habit changes: 

\- Fed sugar cravings with medjool dates instead of nighttime cookies and then transitioned to 1 serving of fruit for sugar 

\- stopped after dinner/pot carb/cheese binges 

\- stopped getting grub hub 2x a week (now it's 1-2 x a month, as a treat)

\- and stopped weekend 'snack"" grocery shopping like a 6 year old whose parents have left for teh weekend (who is also allowed to drink- alcohol = sugar)

Now I prep dinner 1-2x a week bc my favorite convenience foods are too expensive. The only other time I significantly lost weight was also when I was too poor for convenience foods. I'm allowing myself 2-4 simple frozen dinners per fortnight (I shop fortnightly), and they're not terrible - like those fried rice boxes, 6"" pizzas, or Lean Cuisine. I also allow occasional indulences bc this isnt' a diet, it's a new way of livin, for myself. 

I still don't really exercise, I mean, I don't have a routine. I WFH which makes it hard for me bc I have ADHD and I hyper-focus. It's hard to take a break and walk. I get up and move around, dance, stretch, do some pushups. It's not much but it helps a little.

My day looks like: plain greek yogurt with no-HFCS jam for breakfast + cup of tea or coffee; sandwich in wrap or frozen bean burrito for lunch or dinner leftovers with fruit for afters OR have fruit for mid-afternoon snack; protein or fruit snack around 3pm (hardboiled egg, lunch meat roll-ups, peanut butter and saltines); something light i already prepped for dinner like rice and beans or spaghetti with turkey meat sauce or a convenience meal from freeze; if i have afte-rdinner cravings, i have more dinner or any of the above in moderation or medjool dates for dessert cravings. A few times a month I'll have actual dessert (somethin I erally like so it's worth it, like ice cream or home baked cookies).",3,1745870755.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

My first purchases after the shelf were a lot of beans and rice, starting with the immediately useful basics. Now on top of that, I've got some garlic and onion powder, dry milk, canned fruit, some dehydrated veg, lemon juice, diced tomatoes, peanut butter, silken tofu, toilet paper, pet food, a few basic meds, coffee candy, CPAP water, pasta and marinara, and more. There's also some survival tabs that fit all of our food restrictions - about 5 days for each of us. I think the next step is to slowly add the bigger ticket bulk stuff we get: tvp, oatmeal, etc. I've worked from a meal plan ingredients list I built from what we eat most.

I know it could use some infrastructure, but with the level of precarity going on right now, I wanted to get some food gathered before spending more money on inedibles. The shelf is only 3 feet long, and I aim to focus weight on either end. Stock rotation will just have to be manual for a while.

I went into this project just kinda panicked and flailing last fall. It was hard to imagine building something big enough to be useful. But every week something gets contributed. And it adds up!

But lately, it feels like the magic that made the channel special has been fading — and judging by the comments I’ve seen on yt I'm not the only one.

Almost everything now seems to be behind a paywall, and most of the new promotions are tied to paid services. It’s hard not to notice how different the vibe is compared to the earlier days.

The recent collaborations have also been pretty concerning. There was a podcast Iced Coffee Hour guys who were involved in a major crypto scam, and now even a livestream with an OnlyFans creator who's also known for many infamous, unethical things (like promoting >!porn !<content to minors for example ).

It’s especially disappointing because Dr. K has always spoken about the dangers of porn and unhealthy parasocial relationships, and now he’s platforming the very things he used to warn about.

I'm interested in seeing others' perspectives on this.

1ka53l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ka53l7/a_patient_has_passed_away/,a patient has passed away.,"I'm 17m, and I'm currently leaning to become a nurse. In Germany, you don't just study nursing, but you have intervals in which you are at work (ex.: 3 weeks work, 3 weeks school). I started September last year, so it hasn't been that long and I've only worked at a nursing home. I got pretty used to everything in the job; the intimacy that comes with having to wash someone, showering someone, helping them go to the toilet, comforting them when they're thinking about their past, but what I haven't gotten used to is death.

I remember it very clearly. Since I started in September, four residents have died. When the first two residents died, I was still able to be composed. When the third one died, is when I started to crack. She was the oldest lady we had, 98 years old. She had dementia, barely understood anything and was barely able to talk, but despite everything: she was so kind. You couldn't really have a conversation with her, but she would smile at you and hold your hand. I remember when I came back to work after she had died. It was the middle of lunch, and I remember just how low my heart sank when I saw another resident at her designated spot at the table. It was an awful way to find out she was gone. It's been off without her. If you'd come in during the morning, she'd be the first person you'd hear since she was quite loud when she did try to talk. 

Despite everything, I didn't cry when that happened. It was today that fucked me up. Around lunch, a resident had passed away. It was obvious to me that she would pass, but I hoped that I could at least say goodbye to her. We have exams in which a teacher comes to our workplace and watches us prepare a resident for the day. She was the resident I had picked for my first exam, since she was always cooperative, always nice. She lived at our nursing home for almost seven years. She hadn't moved in to die; she had a beautiful seven years with us. Her daughter visited three times a week, she was nice too. It's just unusually painful this time. She used to tell me about her home country, her first day at school, and so much more. I wasn't super befriended with her or whatever, but she was nice. I had always poured her coffee in the morning once I was done preparing her for the day. She was one of the first residents I talked to. I was usually good at keeping distance with the residents, but she was too nice to keep distance with. I couldn't stop myself from getting attached. 

This is the first time I cried so hard to a patient's death. It's sad, because it's not like I really knew her. She was in theory just a resident. But there was so much more behind that. Luckily, I'm in a school week right now, I won't be back at work until late May. That way I don't have to see someone else sit at her seat, where I used to help her walk every day, where I poured her coffee, where I wished her a nice day.

1ka52ps,https://i.redd.it/5hi5yt6htmxe1.png,The War with No Pants: an epic and hilarious dream I had two nights ago,"I dreamed I was a soldier in a war in Tenessee. These are some of my comrades, along with some random girl who was there. Thats me on the far right. If you're wondering why I don't have pants, stay tuned, as it will be explained. Just don't be expected to be satisfied with the answer.

The dream began with an interview with some man. I was telling him what a good soldier I would make, and was given a black ak-47 with molle rails. I wasn't given a uniform or training or anything like that. I didn't even tell my mom what I was doing. 

I was then setting up shape charges and detonating poles along a road that carried a line that was carrying Morse code to the enemy, like this was WWI or some shit. Somehow in the process of me doing this, I lost my pants. I thought that being a soldier in this war was the coolest thing ever and I wanted to take a selfie to commemorate it, but I didn't want to take it while I didn't have pants on. So, finding pants became my goal.

 I went down a hill and saw some enemies driving a car down the road so I had behind a wall of parked cars. I was about to run into a building for shelter, only to realize it was an orphanage. I decided to hide behind the cars instead as I didn't think it was a good idea for some guy with no pants and a gun to go charging into an orphanage.

After the enemies drove off, on the other side of the street I met up with a bunch of my comrades. One of them was a guy about my age wearing a kimono under his Kevlar with a tanto sword. He pulled it out of his uniform and held it to the sky, shouting something about how nobody was going to mess with him. He was a total dork and a nerd, but in a lovable kind of way. I broke down laughing at him in front of everyone so hard I was nearly rolling on the floor.

The pink guy then grabbed me and started lightly beating me, in a playful/hazing sort of way in response to me laughing at tanto guy. I was held and punched again and again in the gut, but it was playful and the whole time i was making jokes to them about fucking their mothers. My squadron was bigger but I don't remember any of them.

Afterwards, I went off on my own, and i was in a Cafe that looked like it was straight out of the middle east. It was full of people. The girl at the counter couldn't speak English but was clearly infatuated with me. Despite the fact she didn't speak English, I somehow communicated that I wanted tea, not coffee, and she gave it to me free of charge as a thank you for keeping them safe. Keep in mind that throughout all this, i had no pants. 

I then regrouped in a hardware/grocery store with my platoon and we were tsking things we needed, like gloves. There were still customers shopping. I looked around desperately for pants, only to realize I had been holding them the whole time. I stepped into a bathroom to finally put pants on. I stepped into a bathroom to put my pants on despite the fact i wasnt wearing pants to begin with. After I got my pants off, I left, and almost left my gun behind but remembered to grab it. During all this, I was getting emergency alerts on my phone about how we were under attack and to seek shelter, and how the mayor was already in shelter. I could hear explosions outside. 

I step outside and see my platoon climbing into the back of a red SUV. They took off before i could get in. I got into a outdoor resturant across the parking lot, a Mexican style one with a wooden Pavillion with climbing flowering vines, and I took a selfie there. It was then i realized the shirt I was wearing this whole time, a tiger t-shirt with cow print on the sides. In the background was the Trump tower. My goal for the dream finally having been satisfied, I woke up. I woke up feeling more well rested than I have in years. ",1,1745870542.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

1ka4zmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeGearReviews/comments/1ka4zmy/could_glacer_mini_splitsystem_ac_18000btu_be_your/,Could GLACER Mini Split-System AC 18000BTU Be Your Perfect Cooling Solution Review?,"The **GLACER Mini AC Split-System** Model B0D14PCMPD has been making waves among homeowners and small business owners alike, so I decided to put it to the test in my own home. After several weeks of use, there’s plenty to unpack about this ductless air conditioner that boasts an impressive range of features, from efficient cooling to a built-in heat pump. While it’s mostly lived up to the hype, there are a couple of considerations to take into account before you pull the trigger.

**Design and Build Quality**

The sleek and compact design of this mini split air conditioner is the first thing that stood out. The white finish gives it a clean and modern look that doesn’t feel jarring or out of place, blending nicely into the aesthetic of my living room. Measuring at a discreet 31 x 8.5 x 12 inches for the indoor unit, it doesn't dominate the space but offers powerful functionality. The outdoor unit is roughly the same width but larger overall. Handling both units during installation confirmed their durability, with the materials feeling sturdier than I expected. However, at roughly 74.8 pounds combined weight, you’ll want professional installation unless you bench press air conditioners for fun.

**Efficient Cooling and Heating**

The cooling capacity of 18000 BTU paired with a built-in 1.5-ton heat pump offered serious climate control. On a particularly muggy summer day, the air conditioner cooled my 1100-square-foot living area in no time. The heating mode also got its moment to shine during a couple of cooler evenings—heating up my space evenly without blasting hot air in a single direction. It provided a tangible sense of comfort, especially with its temperature range spanning from 60°F to 90°F. 

[Discover if GLACER Mini AC Split-System is on sale at Amazon.](https://ehomeco.com/p/b0d14pcmpd/)

**Noise Levels and User Experience**

My experience with the noise level pleasantly surprised me. With the indoor unit running at 42 dB, it was quiet enough for late-night Netflix binges without distraction. Even the outdoor unit, which operates at 51 dB, barely created any disruptions—I could still hear the birds chirping while sipping coffee on my porch. That said, the quiet operation pairs well with its range of modes, like ECO energy-saving mode, dehumidifying mode, and even a sleep mode that adjusts to calmer, quieter settings overnight.

**Key Benefits**

- Offers combined heating and cooling functions for year-round utility.
- Quiet operation ensures minimal noise during use.
- Self-cleaning and a washable filter maintain fresh airflow.
- Features an innovative DC inverter that reduces energy consumption.
- Adjustable fan speeds and wide airflow distribution enhance comfort.

**Installation and Setup**

This is where things got a little tricky. As a non-DIY enthusiast, I complied with the requirement that installation must be conducted by a licensed HVAC professional. While understandable, this adds an extra cost to an already significant investment. If you’re hoping to save on setup costs by doing it yourself, steer clear. However, once installed, the remote control made operating the system a dream—intuitive, responsive, and with sufficient range to manage settings from one end of the room to the other.

**Caveats**

- Professional installation is a must, potentially incurring additional expenses.
- Some users report minor delays in the second package delivery due to split shipping.

**Peer Products**

In comparison to similar split-system air conditioners, I looked closely at models in the same price and SEER2 range. While high-end competitors like Mitsubishi excel in reliability and long-term durability, they often lack as comprehensive an operating mode selection. On the flip side, budget options such as Senville units may undercut this model on price but tend to fall short when it comes to quietness and air distribution. The GLACER Mini AC strikes a balance, bringing decent performance without tipping into extravagant pricing for the features offered.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Though it sits in the mid-range of pricing for mini split systems, the energy efficiency of 19 SEER2, notable for its class, certainly pulled its weight when my electricity bill rolled in. The innovative inverter compressor ensures power is used in moderation, cutting down on the stops and starts that consume more energy. For the added convenience of self-cleaning features, auto defrost functions, and quiet noise levels, the cost feels justified.

I'm a master’s student currently finishing my degree after taking a gap year to work.

Here's the list of hidden fields I found that are still under the radar in 2025:

✅ Shipping Broking (Dry Bulk, Tankers, LNG)  
✅ Private Jet and Yacht Sales  
✅ Energy Trading (Oil, Gas, LNG)  
✅ Specialty Commodity Broking (Coffee, Cocoa, Metals)  
✅ Aircraft Leasing Broking  
✅ Rare Earth Metals Broking (Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt)  
✅ Off-Market Commercial Real Estate Broking

✅ **Bonus:**  
I also found that fintech companies like SS&C, S&P Global, and London Stock Exchange Group have easier entry pipelines compared to banking  
especially if you target **Enterprise Sales** or **Partnerships** roles. (However, pure operations roles aren't as high-reward.)

**Question to the community:**

1ka4zdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka4zdv/how_does_the_bella_steam_espresso_maker_compare/,How does the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker compare in quality and features?,"Crafting the review now, one moment.  

---

**Stylish and Compact Design for Small Spaces**  
I never imagined an espresso machine could be as compact yet stylish as the BELLA 35105-043A. The oatmilk-colored finish is absolutely delightful and blends perfectly with the modern aesthetic of my kitchen. Its slim profile does wonders in saving counter space, making it ideal for tight kitchens or dorm rooms. Measuring just 6.41""D x 12.51""W x 12""H, it's smaller than some of my other coffee gadgets. That said, the lightweight nature does mean it feels less sturdy, occasionally sliding a bit when locking the portafilter in place. This tiny quirk aside, the design effortlessly manages to charm anyone who visits my kitchen.  

**User-Friendly Coffee Brewing Experience**  
Operating this espresso maker was simple enough that even my cousin, who's a self-proclaimed newbie in the coffee-making world, got the hang of it in one go. With its simple button interface and an easy-to-understand manual, the process is far from intimidating. The reusable 4-cup stainless steel filter is a fantastic step towards eco-conscious brewing, delivering flavorful coffee without the waste of paper filters. Brewing your favorite espresso is straightforward: just load the water, add your ground coffee to the portafilter, and within minutes, you're sipping on a rich, aromatic cup of bliss.  

**[Check BELLA 35105-043A price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cyj7w2ss/)**  

**Steam Wand Delivers Exceptional Frothing**  
I have to admit, the built-in steam wand is a gem on this espresso maker. I tried frothing milk for a cappuccino, and it produced velvety microfoam that rivaled the coffee shop near my house. Whether you prefer lattes, flat whites, or experimenting with latte art like my sister loves to, this machine gets the job done with precision. However, I did notice one issue that might irk some users: the steam wand sits a bit low, making it slightly awkward to use with certain milk containers. Turning the machine sideways helped, but a tad more height adjustment would have perfected this feature.  

**Precision Temperature for Perfect Brews**  
The boiler in this espresso machine is nothing short of impressive. Constructed from die-cast aluminum alloy, it ensures the water reaches the optimal temperature for brewing espresso. As someone who despises bitter or weak coffee, I appreciate how this feature consistently delivers cups with robust flavors. I've already experimented with several medium and fine coffee grounds, and the results remain fantastic across the board.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Compact and stylish design suitable for small kitchens.  
- Reusable 4-cup filter is both eco-friendly and cost-effective.  
- Built-in steam wand produces excellent microfoam for milk-based drinks.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Lightweight build results in some sliding on countertops.  
- Steam wand sits quite low, which can make frothing tricky for certain containers.  

**Innovative Features Compensate for Simplicity**  
The glass carafe and removable drip tray are dishwasher-safe, making cleanup relatively stress-free. I found the included 2-in-1 measuring spoon and tamper super handy for prepping precise portions. Though it lacks the fancy automations of high-end machines, the simplicity and reliability of this product shine through. Its overheating and overpressure safety features gave me peace of mind too, particularly when my curious nephew hovered nearby.  

**Competing Brands**  
When stacked against Keurig and Nespresso machines I've used before, this espresso maker holds up remarkably well. While Keurig stands out for its convenience with pods, it often sacrifices depth in flavor. Similarly, Nespresso’s options seem overpriced by comparison, especially since both lack the steaming capabilities this machine offers. Even more expensive machines fail to match the milk frothing quality I’ve experienced here. However, for those seeking solid grips or greater weight, something like the De’Longhi Dedica Al might be worth exploring despite its higher price tag.  

**Financial Value**  
Considering its performance and affordability, this product is worth every penny. Sure, it comes with a few compromises like plastic components and lightweight construction, but it delivers barista-quality espresso and frothy milk on a budget. If you're not ready to spend a small fortune on fancier devices, this one does more than enough to satisfy aspiring home baristas.

1ka4wtp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ka4wtp,Micro Journal Rev 6 just arrived!,"Hello all!

I have had little experience with Writer Decks. I initially bought an Astrohaus Freewrite Traveller, but my first one was broken, and by the time I received the replacement, I had already decided it was too expensive for my personal use case. 

So, I turned to the subreddit darling: the Micro Journal. Some one of you had recommended the Rev 6 to me (versus the Rev 2 which was my initial pick.) 

I ordered the LaLeesa colorway (Black and Pink) but on further thought, requested the pink be changed to purple and lilac. I have been referring to it as my MicroKosmos in my head. 💜 It may not be as visually striking as some of the other colorways, but this one is mine and it suits me perfectly. I would like to get new key caps soon to match her a bit closer. 

I don’t have a battery yet, so little MicroKosmos is chained to the wall. I read in the instructions that if I plug in the cord to the lower left port, the P and Backspace buttons will not work… but on mine I have had the opposite issue where they do not work with the upper left port but work just fine with the lower left. I am praying I don’t do any long term damage to the device by plugging it in this way! This weekend we will get her a proper battery and she will be off to the races (meaning: my office, the coffee shop, a friend’s kitchen table, my mother’s farm…)

I have been practicing typing with her unplugged. The keyboard is tough to get used to! I had a very strict typing teacher who drilled into me the proper way to type, so this feels very unnatural. It’s not bad, though, just new and strange and interesting. 

Setup was rather easy. I expected to fail at something, but no, it was all smooth sailing. 

Thank you so much for your time and effort, Mr. Lee! I adore little MicroKosmos already.

1ka4v7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1ka4v7h/has_anyone_else_noticed_the_busiest_departments/,Has anyone else noticed the busiest departments are the most run down and least paid and the slower ones have high pay and beautiful stations?,"As I imagine a lot of you have, I started at a busy department in a midsized city with a lot of fire and prestige then went to a slower and better paid department.  It's fine for me, but for the fire service, and the community as a whole, I don't see how this imbalance is sustainable.

At my first department, the pay sucked and I lived off of coffee, pre-workout, and Adderall, but I was younger, loved the adrenaline, the station culture, the almost pirate-like lifestyle.

But as I got older and became a dad, it wasn't working without a second job for which I was delirious with sleep deprivation and my wife working full time.

So I made a switch a couple years ago, and though I miss the fire and the sense of belonging and brotherhood, getting paid enough to live on, usually getting enough sleep, and not having to smell and cover corpses before dropping my four year old off at pre-school is pretty unbeatable.

But the community I'm in now has far less of a need for us (though they're more appreciative of than my last community. After each of your five times yearly  room and contents, your station is flooded with gift baskets) and yet it pulls the most experienced people from the places needed the most.

Obviously, this is all to do with the resources a community has, and more affluent communities are less likely to require emergency services.

But this is a pattern repeated throughout the country, and I'm wondering if there are any governments taking steps to address it.",3,1745870044.0,Firefighting,2,1.0,False

Where do y'all go for...

Drinks? We prefer a hole-in-the-wall type bar, rather than a sports bar kinda place. Someone recommended Rixters off Eastchester to us. It's fine, but more of a restaurant with a bar rather than just a straight up neighborhood bar.

Pizza? We tried Blue Rock pizza and it was decent, but where do y'all go for just regular pizza. Like, NY style or something close to it.

Sushi? Where is y our go-to sushi joint? Not the gimmicky places like Shinjuku Station, but that ""always good and been here forever"" place that you are never disappointed by.

Movies? Please. ANYWHERE but the Palladium.

LOCALLY OWNED Coffee Shops? We've been going to Joy Bar coffee because it's down the street, and while it's decent, it's not really our vibe. (Side note: if you live near the Palladium and you've noticed the new drive-thru Caribou Coffee -> go show Joy Bar next door some love instead. Support local!)

I volunteer about 6 hours a week with an animal charity remotely. I wanted to be involved in something I feel passionate about; animal welfare being one of those things.

I have a boyfriend that I see at least a couple of days a week. Sometimes we just hang out around the house and do every day things together. He's unemployed, so between us, neither of us have much money to go on weekly dates. We try to do something at least once a month. 

I usually see my father on a Sunday afternoon for coffee and every few weeks I might visit a cousin of mine to catch up. I don't have a friend circle outside of my boyfriend's friends. 

I'm interested in certain things, but because I'm so exhausted most of the time, I don't have the motivation to start anything. People have literally caught me snoring lightly while being awake, sitting on the couch during the day. I then am bored because it will be too early to go to bed, but I get stuck awake doing nothing exciting. I might browse TV or look at YouTube videos because it requires little to no energy, but I have no interest in it, which bores me more. 

I know I shouldnt complain, but I have too much time now that I don't work. Then again, all of my energy was spent working when I was and I never got to do anything fun anyway afterwards. I'm not a go to the bar on the weekends sort of person. I don't have kids or anything either. 

I want to wake up and look forward to my day, but with the little energy I have, I usually use it to do the daily stuff like groom myself, do laundry, clean the house, get meals prepped and cooked, etc. Not very exciting stuff.

1ka4tbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1ka4tbq/deadpool_is_just_a_distraction/,Deadpool is just a distraction,"So I wake up at 10:00am PST on April Fools Day to a long list of texts within my playgroup. DEADPOOL SECRET LAIR. We all know the story. It's probably already sold out. I'm going to check anyways. Okay sure there's an hour+ long que. I check every, say, 5 seconds until I finally reach the front of the line. It's in my cart. I buy it (It doesn't sell out until the following day). I set out to make a list. It's clear that Deadpool is salty af. Boy that would make for a great distraction. It does. After golfishing for a week and playing 4 games, I've concluded this is the best (most fun, powerful, and accepted) deck I've ever made. I'm still adjusting the decklist. There's probably some superfluous lines, but I like a little creamer with my coffee; aka \[\[Caves of Chaos Adventurer\]\].

# [THE DECKLIST](https://moxfield.com/decks/6sfwf6rsx0KuODS4DqdUVg)

Boy does Rakdos have a LOT of synergy within its infinite combos. \[\[Dualcaster mage\]\] combos with just about every spell you want to be slinging with Deadpool. \[\[Fake your own death\]\] suddenly becomes infinite mana to sink into Deadpool. \[\[Electroduplicate\]\] and \[\[Reanimate\]\] burns everything with any \[\[Terror of the Peaks\]\] effect. Do we even need to talk about \[\[Worldgorger Dragon\]\] and \[\[Animate Dead\]\]? Okay but maybe some of you don't know. Here's the trick. Put in looting effects like \[\[Fear of Missing Out\]\]. 

DISCLAIMER: WORLDGORGER COMBO. MOVE TO SECTION: C-4 IF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THIS ONE BEFORE.

Discard Worldgorger into the yard and then recur it with animate dead. When Worldgorger etb's, animate dead is exiled. This causes Worldgorger to be sacrificed. When it leaves the battlefield, animate dead and all of your other permanents etb. Animate dead can then recur Worldgorger again... loop for Infinite etb/mana. Sink the mana into Deadpool for the win.

Secton C-4:

Anyways, back to the fun synergy! I overlooked Fear of Missing out at first, but I have come to see the strength it possesses. Besides dumping creatures into the bin for recursion and being an enchantment to combo with \[\[Cloudstone Curio\]\], it also has the unique ability to combo with \[\[Jaxis, the Troublemaker\]\] (or any Kiki-jiki/splinter twin variant really) and \[\[Professional Facebreaker\]\]. The result is repeatable combat steps as well as all the looting you could ever ask for.. well as long as an opponent doesn't have a blocker (hey it happens). Swing in with FOMO, untap Jaxis, copy FOMO, Swing with FOMO, untap Jaxis, copy FOMO, swi....

\[\[Cloudstone Curio\]\] you say? That sounds like a fun card. Rakdos has problems with flickering sure, but is this really worth it? YES. Being able to bounce Animate Dead or \[\[Necromancy\]\] from one of your creatures to hand all of a sudden makes it repeatable. The same can be said for \[\[Chthonian Nightmare\]\] providing access to a recursion loop if you can get a little creative with it.

Speaking of recursion. \[\[Junji, the Midnight Sky\]\] pairs nicely with \[\[Metamorphosis Fanatic\]\] for a near infinite recursion loop with each being powerful enough recursive tools in their own right. Deadpool can also utilize each as repeatable recursion. 

\[\[Forsaken Miner\]\] Also makes an appearance in the recursion package. He has a special role to play with \[\[Rakdos, The Muscle\]\] and \[\[Phyrexian Altar\]\], looping to exile all opponents libraries for a sneaky win. 

Rakdos himself works as a hidden/alternate commander to this list. He provides card advantage, a wincon, a sac outlet, as well as being a huge beater that can protect himself. I'm going to run him as the commander at some point in the deck's future.

There is so much more to talk about and discover/adjust with this deck, but I'm very proud of where it is and how fun it was for the whole table. It wins pretty consistently turn 6-8, but it can win much sooner than that since it has a few 2 card combos. If you're group loves Deadpool as much as we all do and you don't mind infinite combos, this deck is a blast to helm and sit across from! Choose the right lines, and don't focus too much on what you can take from your opponents.. just make sure that when you do end up stealing your friends text boxes, give their creatures unique Pool names! My favorite so far was Kardur, DoomPool.. or was it PoolScourge..

# BRACKET: It's probably a low Bracket 4 deck. It has a few game changers, multiple 2 card infinite's, and multiple tutors. It could be sped up quite a bit though I think.

Whenever I've been stressed in my life, I see a very tall man in my dreams for as long as I am stressed out. Sometimes he's there when im not stressed, but mostly he's there when I am.

Im about 5'10 and have had dreams where im standing right next to him. Based on that, he's probably about 10 feet tall.

He's not really sinister. He doesn't stand there smiling at me or threaten me at all. We've never spoken but we look at eachother quite a bit.

Im currently in college and with exams coming up I've seen him a lot more lately. Last night I had a pretty mundane dream about being with friends at a coffee shop and he was standing in line. I looked over at him and he looked over at me and we made eye contact. Then he orders and leaves. 

Nobody ever acknowledges his height. Nobody ever treats him differently than anyone else. He always looks the same. He looks like he's in his mid 20s. Cleanly shaved. Clothes will change but its always some kind of suit or buisness wear, just very professionally dressed no matter the context. He has light brown cleanly kept hair. 

He did scare me one time and exactly one time. 

It was right before High School Senior year finals. I was behind in a few classes and trying to catch up and study. I was pretty tired and had a dream of being at my PC. My room is at the front of the house on the second floor with a window that looks out into the front yard. I heard a car door shut and got up from my desk and parted my curtain just to see who was walking up to the front door, but when I looked out my window there wasn't a car parked in the driveway.

The man was standing out in the street looking in the distance and after I parted my curtains and looked at him for a few seconds, he turned his head quickly and looked up at me. He didn't smile at me creepily, he wasn't holding a knife, he wasn't threatening. He never is. But him knowing to look up at me and doing it so quickly made me break down crying. I remember having the same feeling as when youre a kid and you get caught doing something you shouldn't be doing, but much more intense. Like looking at him like this was wrong. I closed my curtains and felt really panicked and woke up.

Aside from that I've never felt... really anything about him. Not a calming presence, but also not something that scares me. Just like the same way you feel about someone you pass by on the street. You don't think twice about him. 

Obviously, I find it weird when im awake but I don't really feel scared to go to sleep. I kinda did the one time that he scared me, but never really again. Logically, its probably some sort of manifestation of stress that my brain has cooked up. They say you never dream about a face youve never seen before, but I really swear I don't know him. I've seen him as long as I can remember.

1ka4rn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mercari/comments/1ka4rn3/seller_sent_the_wrong_item_and_then_ghosted_me/,Seller sent the wrong item and then ghosted me - what can I expect?,"Hey friends! Please forgive me if I'm posting in the wrong place or if the answer to this is obvious - I'm very new to Mercari. I'll try to make this as short as possible, and for the sake on my anonymity, I'm going to change very minor details. 

So, I was looking for a gift for a friend's birthday, and saw the exact coffee maker she wanted on Mercari - in her color, never used, and affordably priced; the merchant mentioned receiving it as a gift, but already having one and wanting to make room. I thought 'what a blessing!' and I went ahead and purchased it then and there - using my own cash AND some of my credit card points. 

It took about a 12 days for the seller to send it, and in that time I considered ending the transaction, fearing it was fake, but instead decided to just contact the seller and politely ask when I could expect it. I got no correspondence, but the next day, the item was sent. 

For context, I am currently away from home for work, and my friends birthday (at the time of purchase) was about a month away. So the plan was that I would send the coffee maker to my current (out of town) address so that I could check it out, dress it up and make a basket out of it with other fun coffee things, and when my fiance comes to visit me from home, I would send the gift basket back home with him and he would bring it to our friend on the day of her party. easy peasy. 

Until, I arrive home to see the package and realize - it is WAY small. Like... so small that I thought that maybe I had accidentally bought a toy coffee maker for kids or something. So I pick up the package, and also realize that it is quite light. I think myself ""there's no way that a coffee maker is in this box"". So I look at the label, and 1) it is addressed to me, and 2) it is labelled with the sellers correct address and name. So I'm like, what the heck is going on? I hurriedly open the box and inside... is a shirt. A long sleeve lavender purple t-shirt. Is it a nice t-shirt? To someone else, sure, probably. It's an Adidas t-shirt, never worn, so I'm sure, someone would probably like it. *But my friend doesn't like Adidas. My friend doesn't want a t-shirt. She wants a coffee maker.*

At this point, we are about a week from her party - on top of the 12 week delay in sending, the item took a week to arrive, and my fiance's coming to visit within the next few days - so I'm a bit panicked. Frantically, I rush to the app and say ""hi, I'm so sorry, I'm not sure how this happened, but I ordered the coffee maker, and you sent me an adidas shirt - I need this item for a friend, and I'm just wondering if you could help to rectify this?"". I wait for a day, cause you know, I don't wanna get anybody in trouble, I don't wanna tattle on this person if we can just figure it out together. 24 hrs later, still, no answer. 

After that day, I went directly to Mercari and told them the whole situation. I sent them pictures of the item received from multiple angles to show the dimensions of the packaging and the item inside, the label showing the original address and sender, the weight of the item, and my name and address as well. I also sent them screenshots of all the tracking information, as well as my efforts for communication with the seller since the beginning of the transaction. They answered within a few days, saying that they've concluded that the wrong item was sent and they offered me:

**a return label and 3 days to send the package.**

  
Now, you might be wondering ""why is that so bad?"" and honestly, in another circumstance, it actually wouldn't be. I would go my printer, tape it on, get in my car, and drop off the package, no problemo. But the issue here is that I'm *not* at home. I do not have a printer, and I am not within a reasonable distance to the shipping facility that they want me to go to. On top of that, I don't have a normal job - the hours for my job shift from project to project, and even within the project, as we go through different phases of completion, I do not have the same hours every day. In the phase we're currently in for this particular job, I am working 12 hours a day. To even get to work on time (which for the job means 30 mins ahead of start time) I have to leave 1 1/2 hrs ahead of time. So I leave my house at 10 AM to get to work by 11 AM to start work at 11:30 AM, work until 11:00 PM, leave work and transit home to hopefully sit on my couch by 12 AM. By midnight, I am physically busted, but my brain is completely alert, so I don't fall asleep until around 1:30 AM. Then I wake up at 9:30, shower, eat, and do it all again the next day - this will be the case for the next two months (It's brutal, but I freaking love my job). 

All that to say, I don't have the time, energy, or money to make this return. And I told the folks at Mercari just that. I said ""Hey there, I don't have a printer, I don't live close to the shipper, I work extremely long hours, and, - I don't think it fair for you all to expect that I should go out of my way to pay to print this label out, or pay the extra money to travel this package to the shipper - also, even if I didn't have a problem with those things, I would have to give up much needed rest to make this happen. I feel as if it's been made my responsibility to pay *more money* to correct a mistake in order to get my refund, but this wasn't my mistake. Might you all be willing to send me the label in the mail and set up a pick up from the shipper?""

They said ""Sorry for the inconvenience. We suggest that maybe you get a friend to help..."", to which I did not reply.

So I went to my credit card company to dispute the charge. I figured it was my last shot. But, back to my original question - does anyone have any clue what I can expect from this? I did some research about vendors sending incorrect products, and saw that it would be my right to keep it (which truly isn't my concern, because it's not my friend's size or style, and I never wear it myself). but also that in keeping it **I would still be entitled to a refund, and that any company who is refusing to refund me is doing so illegally.** Does anyone know if this is true? Might I get my money back? Is it even possible to get my credit card points back? Oh Lord. 

...I know I promised not to say too much, but if you made it to the end, I thank you for going on the ride with me. Looking forward to any advice or insight you may have.",1,1745869794.0,Mercari,1,1.0,False

1ka4prc,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1ka4prc/does_the_guaever_aesu131_blood_pressure_monitor/,Does the GUAEVER AES-U131 Blood Pressure Monitor Live Up to Its Promises? Review,"The GUAEVER AES-U131 Blood Pressure Monitor is a gadget that, honestly, I didn’t know I needed until I started using it. My mornings now routinely include a quick check of my blood pressure before I sip on coffee, and this device has made that process unusually convenient. As someone who struggles to trust reading accuracy after some past disappointments with other devices, the standout promise of individually calibrated pressure readings here really piqued my interest. After spending weeks with this product, I’ve tested it under different conditions and settings to get a full picture of what it offers—and where it may fall short.

**Effortless Design and Intuitive Features**  
It’s rare to find something tech-heavy that doesn’t require a full Ph.D. to operate, but this blood pressure monitor genuinely hits the sweet spot. Everything from the one-button measurement to the automatic inflation kept the experience hassle-free. It even has voice guidance during the measurement process, which is particularly helpful if eyesight isn’t your strong suit. On the flip side, if you find the voice unhelpful or just plain annoying, there's an option to switch it off. Conveniently, it shuts off automatically after 60 seconds, which I discovered was great for preserving battery life. 

**Check [GUAEVER AES-U131 Blood Pressure Monitor] price on Amazon.**  

**Inexpensive Backlight Technology That Just Works**  
One thing that instantly stood out is the three-color backlight system. It’s foolproof—even if you don’t read the numbers. Green tells you your blood pressure is in the normal range, orange nudges you toward caution, and red? Well, red is your cue to focus on some serious health management or consult a professional. This visual coding adheres to the WHO Hypertension Guidelines, making it not just practical but internationally recognized. A friend of mine who has colorblindness saw the obvious limitations here, though she noted the voice functionality helped her navigate around this.

**Smart Storage Capabilities for Whole-House Use**  
If you’re sharing the device within your household, this model accommodates up to two users. It meticulously stores 99 readings per user for a whopping total of 198 records. My partner and I often alternate our health checks, and this memory system feels like a personal health log we didn’t know we needed. The three-reading average feature further amplifies the reliability of the data you collect over time, preventing any knee-jerk reactions to unusual single readings.

**Adjustable Cuff That Stands Out**  
My experience with blood pressure cuffs hasn’t always been pleasant; they often feel either too tight or annoyingly loose. This one came with an adjustable strap ranging from 8.7 inches to 16.5 inches, which fit me perfectly without leaving me with that squeezing discomfort. It uses durable materials, and the Velcro strap stayed in place during every reading without budging an inch. My sports-enthusiast brother also tried it out post-workout, and it fit his larger arms comfortably with no strain. I can’t tell you how validating that was, as finding a cuff size that’s universally accommodating can often be a headache.

**Highlights**  
- The voice broadcast system makes the process smooth, particularly for elders or individuals with visual impairments.  
- Backlight color coding is a foolproof mechanism for interpreting results.  
- Stores multiple user data with significant storage—perfect for families or shared use.  
- Compact design suited for home use, work, and even travel.

**Limitations**  
- The voice guidance is helpful for most but might not be appreciated universally—it can feel intrusive in quiet environments.  
- The reliance on AAA batteries could be frustrating in a pinch; some competitors offer rechargeable solutions that I feel should become standard.  
- Seeing the temperature fluctuations of readings when taken back-to-back points to it being better for consistent, long-term monitoring rather than moment-to-moment checks.

**Competing Products**  
I’ve explored alternatives like the Omron Platinum and Beurer BM55, and while they compare in precision and ease of use, the GUAEVER BP monitor is unbeatably cost-effective. Both competitors feature Bluetooth syncing with apps, which might entice those who enjoy connecting devices for health tracking. But if you’re looking for something basic yet functional while being budget-conscious, GUAEVER stands firm. On the downside, Omron offers longer cuff sizes and slightly more accurate recalibration technology, which can matter for very specific medical needs.

**Value Proposition**  
For all its premium-like features, this blood pressure monitor manages to remain totally accessible. Set against brands charging higher premiums primarily for app-based bonus features that aren’t critical for everyday users, this is definitely smart spending. The upfront simplicity it offers makes it friendlier for those less into the whole tech world while still providing reliable performance. While it could do better by switching to built-in lithium batteries in future iterations, the battery setup isn’t enough of a deterrent to dislike it.

My favorite personally is the desks where computers are supposed to be, but they're empty. The Downside is that this has certain times for being open. 9am-4:30PM.

Peter's Campus Life Building (Commuters Lounge):

Loved this area for quite a bit. I constantly switch spaces, but this place has 2 big desks with whole extension cords to plug multiple things into. A few comfy chairs. A table. And it has a couple of computers. There is also free coffee and tea. There is a microwave and a roaster oven in here as well.

Reavis (Room 310 and the Student & Faculty Lounge):

Both of these rooms are great. I love dusable at night when no one is around and I need to have a late night of studying. Room 310 is nice for passing periods and online classes. But it is very nice at night. It has a couch and one comfy chair. There are plenty of desks with outlets and extension cords at most. 

The student and faculty room is great, too. There is a mini fridge, toaster oven, microwave, and coffee maker. There is one very big comfy chair, a desk, a couch, and a whole area where you can color! This room is meant to be an anxiety reducing room, with fun games and coloring sheets. There are some fidget toys in here as well.

There are also plenty of open empty classrooms that are unlocked after classes are over. I highly recommend using them if you work better in a classroom like me!

Founders Library:

There are MANY places to study here. There are also Einstein bagels! It's yummy and nice if you need a quick break or a coffee to start your day! But you can look up the Founders Library. There's a lot of places to study. I will mention that there are PRIVATE studies for single person use only. They are very nice with a desk and comfy chair. These rooms are very small. There are also group study rooms you can reserve. As well as the 2 open, unreservedly rooms. There is a meditation room and a scholars den, which is for reading and studying.

Neptune Central:

Great place if you like to work around people. It's also open all hours of the night! There is a fireplace, plenty of comfy chairs, desks, and computer desks. 

Dusable (2nd floor):

There is a great lounge area next to vending machines and printers. There are a lot of people during the day, and there's usually always an event where someone is selling some sweet snacks. 

Holmes Student Center:

Great for group studying and individual. I like the 2nd floor where the computers are the best. There are charging areas basically everywhere and nice chairs to sit in. The first floor also has a great study area known as the Oasis. This is usually where campus events are going on, so it tends to be noisy. But there is food from the Huskie Den and Qdoba during the week. There is also a Starbucks here and the student center C-Depot, which is another place to get food.",2,1745869621.0,NIU,0,1.0,False

Not everyone can afford that, especially not students, workers, or local families.

What’s surprising is that there are so many colleges and schools in and around the area — like Cochin College, Gujarati College, and a bunch of schools like St. Sebastian, St. Joseph’s, etc. Every day hundreds of students are moving around here, but there are literally no pocket-friendly places where they can chill, hangout, grab a tea, some biryani or snacks without burning their wallet.

After college hours or during lunch breaks, these students mostly end up sitting on roadside walls or bus stops with very few good options to eat. If you think about it, even travelers and local workers who come to Fort Kochi/Mattancherry would prefer a decent, affordable eating spot over fancy tourist cafés sometimes.

There should be a building or a well-planned space where small food outlets can operate — offering simple, hygienic, tasty food at reasonable prices like ₹50–₹150. A place that’s clean, vibrant, and welcoming, but not ultra-fancy.

Fort Kochi and Mattancherry have so much history, culture, and life — it’s sad if only people with big budgets can fully experience it. A good food spot for students, local workers, budget travelers, and families would really bring back that original friendly vibe this place had.

He looked in my throat with a light and my nose and ears(apparently I had a massive build up of ear wax lol.) Cleared out now. He gave me a sample of some nasal spray for my constant dry nostrils.

I asked him about the GERD flair getting worse and he did the small scope to see if we needed to do an endoscopy and he looked at my ct scan with contrast I had from a month before where I went to the ER after burning my throat with hot coffee( seems like the GERD symptoms with lump in the throat etc got worse after that and starting on my cpap machine.)

I told him I was taking 20mg of omeprazole and he said keep taking it until everything heals and then he said I could try tampering off of it at that point. He didn’t say anything about increasing it and told me to avoid coffee and citrus.

He said he saw mild to medium irritation that was probably from the hot coffee and reflux and still healing. He said he didn’t see anything major that would warrant an endoscopy.

My question is does that mean he didn’t find anything that would indicate Barrett’s esophagus or throat cancer and I should be in the clear for those two things? I am still worried with this constant throat burning. Good news is it seems to go down during the day and get more intense at night, but not like excruciatingly painful or anything; but there for sure.

1ka4i9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka4i9w/can_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_truly_transform/,Can the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Truly Transform Small Spaces Review,"Sleek, compact, and surprisingly efficient, the **Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker**, model K-Mini, has been part of my morning routine for a couple of months now. Black and modern in design, it easily blends into my kitchen decor without taking up too much counter space, which is a lifesaver in my tiny apartment. Not to mention, the single-serve concept works wonders for my erratic coffee-drinking habits. Although it’s got plenty of upsides, there are a few quirks that I feel are worth discussing.

**Compact Design for Tight Spaces**  
As someone tackling the challenges of a small kitchen every day, I can’t overstate how much I appreciate the slim profile of this coffee maker. Measuring less than 5 inches in width, it fits snugly in a corner, leaving room for other necessities. Its minimalist aesthetic with a matte exterior finish is easy on the eyes and complements most kitchen themes. Although it’s lightweight and portable, it feels sturdy enough, so its durability hasn’t been a concern. I occasionally move it between my kitchen and office desk setup, and the handy cord storage feature makes this transfer neat and quick.

**User-Friendly Functionality**  
Operating the coffee maker involves bare-bones simplicity, which is both a positive and a negative depending on how sophisticated you like your gadgets. I fill the single-cup reservoir, pop in my chosen K-Cup pod, and with the press of a button, it brews a fresh, hot cup of coffee within minutes. As someone not particularly tech-savvy, I find the button-only interface incredibly intuitive. However, for those looking for customization or more enhanced brewing settings, this might seem a little too basic.  

**Grab [Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker K-Mini] now—[Amazon price check here](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/).**  

**Brewing Versatility**  
Speaking of cups, the flexibility offered by this coffee maker is one of its standout traits. It caters to different brewing sizes from 6 to 12 oz, depending on your preference or caffeine needs for the day. Whether you’re brewing a quick 6 oz shot to jumpstart your morning or a larger 12 oz to keep you going during a long study session, it adapts without a hitch. Also, the removable drip tray fits travel mugs up to 7 inches tall, an unexpected but useful bonus for my on-the-go mornings.

**Energy-Saving Features**  
Efficiency seems to be deeply ingrained in this brewer's DNA. The auto-off feature that activates 90 seconds after your last brew is quite impressive. I can’t count the number of times I’ve left traditional coffee machines running only to realize hours later. With the Keurig K-Mini, that fear of unnecessarily losing energy or creating a fire hazard is entirely off the table.

**Pluses**  
- Slim and compact, fitting neatly into tiny spaces.  
- User-friendly interface requiring no prior tech experience.  
- Flexible brew sizes to suit individual preferences.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Lacks advanced features like temperature control or a programmable timer.  
- The single-cup reservoir means refilling before every use.  
- The machine does not include a reusable filter, which must be purchased separately.  

**Competitive Options**  
I compared this model to a competitor, the Nespresso Essenza Mini, which also targets small-space coffee lovers. While both machines are ultra-compact and cater to single-serve coffee drinkers, the Essenza Mini offers slightly better espresso-style coffee, thanks to its high bar pressure. However, it comes with limited pod options and is slightly more complex to operate. On the other hand, the Keurig K-Mini shines when it comes to compatibility, as the sheer variety of K-Cup flavors and types beats any other brand in the market, hands down. For those just seeking quick, hassle-free coffee, the simplicity and versatility tilt in favor of this coffee maker.

**Quality for Price**  
Given that it fulfills its purpose as a single-serve brewer for small spaces exceptionally well, I think the cost justifies its features. The durability, energy-saving aspect, and general usability make it a worthy investment, especially for individuals, college students, or anyone looking for a clutter-free coffee machine. That said, I wish the reusable filter came included to eliminate recurring pod expenses.

Being someone who values comfort and efficiency, trying out this radiator heater was both exciting and practical. While it offers a lot to appreciate, there are a few quirks worth pointing out.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment it came out of the box, the sleek black design stood out. It’s compact enough to fit seamlessly into my home office and living room without taking up unnecessary space. The wavy oil-filled fins aren't just visually appealing; they’re designed to enhance heat dispersion. Its lightweight build (just over 16 pounds) paired with smooth-gliding caster wheels makes relocating it between rooms surprisingly easy. I’ve dragged this thing all over the house effortlessly, whether it was my bedroom for late-night warmth or my kitchen during early-morning coffee prep.

**Strengths**  
- Highly portable with an ergonomic handle and caster wheels.  
- Stylish, modern design suitable for any indoor setting.  
- Compact dimensions make it easy to store when not in use.  

**Performance and Versatility**  
What caught my attention immediately was how this heater excels at creating long-lasting warmth. I tried all three heat settings—High (1500W), Medium (900W), and Low (600W)—and every single one of them adjusted perfectly to the temperature I desired. The thermostat had no trouble maintaining a cozy ambiance, even during colder nights when extra heat was necessary. One feature that stood out was its whisper-quiet operation; without a fan, there’s zero noise, making it perfect for work or sleep. Those who dislike the humming sound typical of fan heaters will find this a breath of fresh air. Or should I say, a wave of quiet heat?

**Want [Amazon Basics CY83RR-7] discounts? Check Amazon.**  

**Safety Features**  
Knowing safety is a primary concern, I tested the built-in protection mechanisms thoroughly. The tip-over and overheat protection features gave me peace of mind, especially with rambunctious pets darting around. The ETL safety certification feels like a stamp of approval for leaving it running in the background during work hours. Out of curiosity, I even nudged it to test its stability; the safety mechanisms instantly kicked into action.

**Plus Points**  
- Reliable tip-over protection ensures safety in homes with pets or toddlers.  
- ETL certification reinforces trust in its secure usage.  
- Overheating safeguards for extra peace of mind.  

**Efficiency and Maintenance**  
The heater doesn’t need much in terms of maintenance—no oil refills, no fuss. The diathermic oil inside is sealed permanently, which means it takes care of itself while maintaining impressive energy efficiency. It keeps dispersing heat long after being turned off, lowering electricity usage. Over the weeks, I noticed a slight drop in my home’s heating costs, which is always a win. Plus, cleanup only requires a quick wipe with a dry cloth—simple!

**Control and User Experience**  
I’ll admit, figuring out the remote control was child’s play. Adjusting the settings from across the room was blissfully convenient on mucky winter mornings when I didn’t want to leave my blanket cocoon. The easy-to-use digital control on the unit itself also felt intuitive. However, the absence of some smart features like app integration or scheduling capabilities might disappoint those looking for cutting-edge tech.

**Negative Attributes**  
- Lack of smart-home compatibility might feel outdated to gadget enthusiasts.  
- Slight fan of radiant heat over forced-hot air may disappoint broader preferences.  
- Controls on heater slightly frustrating @some remote.  

**Competing Options**  
Stacked up against similar models, certain hallmarks seemed sharper (energy-conscious yet low-noise++)",1,1745869137.0,SpaceHeaters101,0,1.0,False
1ka4heq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ka4heq,Reflections on Anticonsumption from a Mom in the G strip,"War has made us specialists in anti-consumption. A year and a half in, there are few things that make me feel the joy in resilience, but one of them is how my three-year-old son Samih, who barely has food for himself, continually choses to share his food with the stray kittens. It is a real irony, how losing everything shows you how little you truly need. I see now that the only things I needed to have a happy life were a warm home in a safe city, food to eat, and my family together.

Of course, our situation is not like those in this subreddit who are invested in anti-consumption out of principle, rather than choice. I recognize that, and I won't hide from you: we are experiencing death, bombing, and terror, and basically the markets are almost empty. We have come to rely on social media for donations just to provide the most basics: pampers, milk for our son, flour (which has become $200 a bag). So I am very determined to continue.

I try to add value to these subreddits, not just share my story and donation link, so I will leave you with this: if you have been struggling lately to stay committed to the mission of anti-consumption, take my story as an opportunity to reflect on what it really is you really need in life to be happy. Or perhaps take a lesson from my son, and remember the fullness that can come from giving to others rather than keeping for yourself.

We Muslims remind ourselves of the spiritual value of anti-consumption every year during Ramadan. A month of not eating during the day to then have feasts with friends and family at night and in the early hours of the morning nourishes our souls, reminds us of our blessings, and puts us in touch with the suffering of others around the world. It is a practice that deeply grounds us, even as we struggle with poverty and hunger.

That being said, I hope you stay with us. Perhaps you will find some meaning in spending the money you would have spent on trendy clothes or Starbucks coffee on my little family:,).",1,1745869080.0,u_updatesfromwithin,0,1.0,False

So much heart pain, chest pain, I felt like I wanted to throw up, I felt like I needed to cry. It was awful. I started to hyperventilate too but I did my best to keep my breathing steady. 

The heart and chest pain make my anxiety worse because I’m 100% convinced I’m going to die of a heart attack one of these days but my heart is pretty healthy as of right now. Lots of tests done on me (for other reasons) and all of them tell me I’m physically healthy. I know it’s because of anxiety because I went away for the weekend and didn’t go to work. Guess what I didn’t experience? Heart and chest pain. I was drinking copious amounts of coffee for those three days, including at night, and didn’t experience any adverse reactions. 

The second I realize I’m going to work is the second I start to feel the pain again. It’s awful and scary and doesn’t go away ever. I know it’s not the coffee. It’s 100% or at the very least 90% the anxiety. I can’t go on regular anxiety medication without it causing issues with my bipolar 2 and the medication I was prescribed to help with a bunch of my issues was rejected coverage because my insurance didn’t think it was justified. 

I’ve lived with anxiety for as long as I can remember. Since I was probably 5-6. I’ve always had some sort of fear/anxiety. You would think that after living with something for almost two decades, you’d be accustomed or find ways to make life better but unfortunately that isn’t the case for me.

* September 2024 - follow up PAP, results came back HR HPV+ but no abnormalities, still just inflammation
* Doctor recommends a colposcopy because I've had HPV 2 years in a row.
* October 2024 - first colposcopy; Dr took two biopsies and no ECC. She said my cervix looked healthy and maybe had mild CIN
* October 2024 - results come back as ""focal CIN 2/3"". Dr recommends I wait 6 months for another biopsy, at which point we will decide whether or not I'll need a LEEP
* April 2025 - second colposcopy; Dr took four punch biopsies + 1 ECC (ouch)
* April 2025 - Results come back; everything is completely benign aside from slight inflammation. She did not test for HPV so I'm unsure if I still have it. 

In the 6 months between my first and second biopsies, I made some major life changes in order to give my immune system the best possible chance at beating CIN/HPV. 

* Anti-inflammatory diet:
   * Completely cut out alcohol. I also stopped smoking weed which I previously did \~3xs a week.
   * Cut out caffeine for the most part. I stopped drinking energy drinks, and if I did have coffee, I made sure I had already eaten breakfast (this was so helpful for my anxiety too)
   * Stopped drinking soda, even sugar-free
   * Incorporated more of these foods into my diet: sweet potatoes, broccoli, brussel sprouts, carrots, celery, spinach, and dates. 
   * Started eating high-protein meals every day 
   * Started taking a high-quality multivitamin with these ingredients specifically: folic acid, b12, vitamins C, D. I took one with a bunch more things too, it was called Metagenics on Amazon
   * Took hyaluronic acid supplements + b12 + green tea + AHCC ([study here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10051187/)) 
* Took a break from sex and then strictly used condoms after \~2 months break ([study here](https://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(23)00628-0/fulltext#:~:text=Condom%20use%20increases%20the%20chance,be%20explained%20in%20several%20ways))
* Both my partner and I got the Gardasil-9 vaccine. They had never been vaccinated and I had the Gardasil-4 vaccine about 12 years ago. ([study here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23009908))
* Focused on getting GOOD sleep. Like 8-10 hours a night, which is ideal for me.
* Exercising regularly. This helps reduce inflammation and really helped my anxiety about the whole situation.

I tried to keep to all of this as much as possible, although I did mess up a few times. All of these changes were driven by my anxiety, which isn't great, but I'm glad that I did them because it made me feel more in control and like I was doing everything I possibly could--the rest was up to things out of my control. 

All of this being said, there are some things that worked in my benefit. I am 26, so regression rates are higher for people that are my age. My initial results said 'focal' CIN2/3, which means the area may have been small to begin with. Additionally, all of my results have come back with signs of inflammation, which I've found out recently can look a lot like CIN--maybe my first results were wrong? Either way, I hope this list is helpful to anyone out there wanting to make some beneficial lifestyle changes. I realize that I am very lucky and that most of this is up to random chance. This diagnosis caused me a lot of mental anguish for the past 6 months, and all I can say to anyone reading this is that the waiting is the worst part.

1ka4cwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1ka4cwq/worst_coworker/,Worst Coworker,"I work with a guy who for the past year and a half has been a nightmare, and lately he's been getting to me a little too much. 

We build trusses and floors so the job is physically demanding, especially in the summer and fall when we are the most busy. I understand it's hard to find people who are willing to swing a hammer and work in the heat, let alone find people who enjoy it. I love the work, and pretty much everyone except this one guy. 

He shows up when he feels like it, leaves when he feels like it and frequently shows up 3 hours late. Some days he just doesn't come in at all. He can be a good builder when he wants to be, but he's pretty scattered and disorganized anyway. Breaks things because he's not paying attention and does things that are unsafe. He also likes to tell everyone he drinks on the job at times. This isn't the place for that. He also lies about why he's gone so the bosses don't do anything about this crap. 

The reliable employees show up every day, we get backed up because we are short handed, get posted a crap ton of overtime and weekends, just for the lazy people who put us behind to not show up for the overtime anyways. Don't get me wrong I like the money but our busted bodies need a break sometimes or we have plans. 

On top of this, the same guy will pester me when I'm doing building and he's doing ""busy work"" that's boring as if I need to trade him so he's not bored. He will complain about hours I get that he doesn't. But the guy shows up late every time there's building for him to do so why would they give him the priority jobs? 

Guy also confessed to me that when I started he didn't think I'd last as a woman and it actually made him mad to see that I am one of the best builders and I do really well. Just got under my skin. I said ""So if I was a man and I was good at this you would be fine with it?"" And he replies ""well that sounds bad but yeah kinda""

Dude just gets on my nerves. Right now we are short handed again and he's still doing the same idiotic things and left 30 minutes into the day, leaving me and one other guy to build alone. I can't take it anymore. Seeing him walk through the door with his stupid coffee cup, late, texting as always, burns me up. Management does nothing about it even though they ""talk to him"". 
How do I prevent myself from committing a crime/start enjoying work again despite him? 

And he steals all my gum. ",2,1745868775.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/u07pbl67nmxe1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=b57a9181757be657619a4399672ecb5816cb372c

Some say Rosalina is the Hottest in the Mario trio. Some say Rosalina makes no sense in this Universe whatsoever. Some say Rosalina is a break from the whole damsel in distress thing.

I think Rosalina is Rosalina, she’s got her role and she does it well, plus that star power is pretty cool.

As for her being the hottest in the trio, whoever said that wasn’t thinking correctly, she’s like, third due to character. More on that later, but props to Rosalina’s Biker outfit in Mario Kart!

**218. Gwen Stacy/Spider Gwen (Marvel)**

Gwen reminds me of a Spider wanna be. I mean she is a spider, but she’s always just been a side character to me. Existing only for the sake of supporting and being the future wife of Miles Morales or Peter Parker or whatever.

She’s got one of those hot petite bodies, not princess petite, so she’s got me sold there. Other than that, she doesn’t really appeal to me.

I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong and biased, but I’m right about one thing, compared to others, she’s a C rated girl.

**217. Asuka Kazama (Tekken)**

https://preview.redd.it/rmiy8ef9nmxe1.png?width=247&format=png&auto=webp&s=77654cea23a711d5ff30eb7cf69b10dead7e8850

Tekken Characters always amaze me with their animation and how smooth they look. Especially in Tekken 8 because Asuka’s legs are something to look at…

Uhh anyway, Asuka is a master of Kazama style martial arts. Kinda like Dan Hibiki and his Saiko style from Street Fighter (except not as strong cause, you know, Dan’s weak as heck)

She reminds me of Xianghua from Soul Calibur look wise. They both have that traditional Japanese schoolgirl look.

Asuka’s a cool character, she’s strong too. Like, I wouldn’t mess with her at all she’s got good fighting style. Heck, she even beat up the self-proclaimed goddess Lili, and let’s be honest here we all wanted to see that.

**216. Marinette/Ladybug (Miraculous: The Adventures of Ladybug and Cat Noir)**

https://preview.redd.it/zfxktlnanmxe1.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a28f0950b87cbec24a42a60a41ce671e4c6fd3

I know she should probably be lower but, come on man, grown adults watch Miraculous, it must be some kind of respectable.

Miraculous is the show man, they have one of the last, actually creative teams left in this generation. Marinette looks decent though too, this show could legit be an anime and thrive.

Marinette is Lady bug in this show, and she has her superpower “Lucky Charm” which allows her to basically exploit her enemy’s weakness, pretty cool. She’s also smart too, while Cat Noir is 90 percent of the time useless during battle, Marinette is basically carrying the whole time.

Not to mention her costume which has gotten cooler over the years. As Marinette she’s not as attractive, but as ladybug in that suit, she’s kinda decent.

**215. Temari (Naruto)**

https://preview.redd.it/1b0h5a0cnmxe1.png?width=314&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0365f2f3d748ba1cc1d206071b26394dde9d98d

Temari, to me, is just a flat-out respectable character. The only thing that’s not respectable is that hairdo, but that’s her you know, that’s Temari.

She’s an average girl, that’s why she’s in the C ranks, but I don’t think it does any disrespect to her character. Temari is strong and smart and does her job in the Naruto universe.

She beat Tenten in the Chunin Exams which was cool, I was actually rooting for Tenten Cause the Neji, Lee, and Tenten squad was just so cool, and I thought that Temari was pretty mean back then.

Later on, she became a valid wind user Fourth Great Ninja war. She even managed to hit Madara somehow, someway. She regretted it later, but it just goes to show how brave, bold and stupid she was to try and fight Madara Uchiha. Either way you see it she’s a real Soldier.

**214. Daisy (Mario)**

https://preview.redd.it/hshq11cdnmxe1.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=222516a316f9166b990c1b9d43748a7230d38e96

Ok, the only reason Daisy is above Rosalina is because she’s a little more colorful as far as story goes. She’s a damsel in distress but she doesn’t want to be so badly. She’s really a tomboy and would probably prefer to beat up bad guys herself. However, she can’t cause she’s a princess.

At least she’s not just some powerful overlord who rarely shows up and stays in one place. Plus, personally I think she’s hotter. Besides, how about her biker suit.

**213. She Ra (The Legend of She Ra)**

https://preview.redd.it/gfa0ejgfnmxe1.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fd1384130d5b0704e111c97da1faecc27e2b33b

Keep in mind that the She Ra I speak of is the She Ra that we all know and respect. That is, the Original She Ra television show. The one that had her and He Man. Not that new Cartoon Network crap.

She Ra thankfully wasn’t sexualized in that T.V show and wasn’t featured as a gender swap, He Man. They made the show about a girl for better ratings obviously, but they made it make sense and you could tell that He Man had not become irrelevant or any less powerful.

She was also a Powerhouse in her own right, which was cool. Nowadays She Ra is, well to put it simply, ruined. We will always remember your former glory.

**212. Stargirl (DC)**

https://preview.redd.it/23anmkrgnmxe1.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=b18fa4f797f6b44545efec04d0effcb54c5cdcfb

Aye man, I don’t care what anybody says, Stargirl is hot.

I know what I said earlier about blonde hair, and blue-eyed girls, but Stargirl’s apart of that one exception I was talking about. She’s also a fun person too. She’s a teenager who’s basically a Justice league wannabe but she’s not experienced enough.

She wields the power of the Star Staff which is this powerful alien weapon that can shoot powerful blasts of energy beams at your enemy, oh and it can fly. This makes Stargirl’s job a whole lot easier, the only thing is that she must learn to use it better and control it.

While her star-spangled banner outfit is a little overdone, she’s easily one of the best teenaged superheroes out there. She’s smart, sexy, and strong. I watched most of the CW adaptation of Stargirl (Actors were terrible, well except for Pat Dugan and the new Hourman guy) and apparently her father was Starman and then she gets the staff and starts her own Justice society of America.

Cool right? She doesn’t compare in hotness to the other Contenders on this list but, she’s earned her spot.

**211. Carmen Sandiego (Were on Earth is Carmen Sandiego)**

https://preview.redd.it/z6qo56uinmxe1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb9f450d083279a985184708821582720c31bc4f

Carmen is a cool character to me, whoever made her is genius.

She was basically raised as an orphan and then transferred to train at ACME detective agency where she got the highest grades and solved the most cases. ACME had high hopes for her until she decided to leave and become a criminal, and they haven’t been able to find her since.

The original show, Were on Earth is Carmen Sandiego, which was on Qubo, was less about Carmen, like the new one is, and more about ACME and other criminals out to find Carmen, well in a way anyway.

Almost every episode they failed, well, every episode really, it was kind of pathetic. In a sense Carmen was a smoooooooth criminal, oh yeah. (Feels good to say smooooooth criminal)

**210. Decapre (Street Fighter)**

https://preview.redd.it/jozoun3lnmxe1.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=132c0c2fc64f4d7eb594382271082552d6b1c129

Decapre is kind of a sad story, excuse me, Decapre is definitely a sad story.

Here’s why, Cammy, the former Doll, escaped M Bison’s crib and went off to regain her memory. She promised her “sisters” that she would come back for them, but when she did, she failed and ended up losing them all. Long story short Decapre ended up hating Cammy for making false promises and not being able to save them.

Decapre has really become a bitter, angry, killing machine. I think the scar on her face came from a burning accident. If it wasn’t for that and the fact that she’s a shadow clone Cammy, she’d be higher on the list. However, as she stands, she’s just a thot.

**209. Starlight (The Boys)**

https://preview.redd.it/1vc9jf9mnmxe1.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dc6df0c9d328a2b4ac8bd8b7d9edf492b62a939

The Boy’s comic was gruesome already. The show just brought it to life.

If you’ve read the Boys comic, you can tell that Annie (Starlight) gets walked on all over when she joins the Seven. Homelander really runs that place like a machine. I mean, she can’t help but stay by the foot that keeps stepping on her tail cause she’s a good girl. She doesn’t know what else to do, that’s why she gets taken advantage of so much.

There’s a scene in the comic that shows Homelander drawing black marker on Annie’s chest and boobs in a V shape to show her how he wants her new suit to look. All the while, Annie looks miserable.

Annie ranks this low cause she’s a pushover. She’s also that standard Blonde hair, blue eyes standard I was telling you about. Even later on when she seems like she wants to stand up for herself, she’s weak as heck so Homelander or even Butcher can’t take her seriously. She’s a joke honestly, but hey, she’s better than some.

**208. Makoto (Street fighter)**

https://preview.redd.it/zfraiumnnmxe1.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d920f3345319ad54ced69d5442b4296092bc01d

Listen, the only reason Makoto’s in here is cause she’s super-duper overrated in the sense that she’s hot. So, I figured, what the heck she’s a popular enough character, throw her in there.

Apparently, people seem to be attracted to her because all she has under her boyish Karate gi is some red underwear and a red sport bra. I’m just gonna call it out and say, that’s pretty screwed up. In real life I’m not attracted to some girl just because all they have is a bathing suit under their shirt at the pool.

Also, I don’t even see Makoto in that light. She’s just a filler character for the sake of redesigning the Street fighter roster in Street fighter III: Second Impact. I can’t hate on her too much though, there are some people out there who respect Makoto, and so do I.

She wants to get stronger and enters the tournament for the sake of restoring honor to her father’s dojo. She’s not that hard to beat in the arcade mode, but she’s still a cool character that has room for improvement. I for one totally would like to see her in a future Street fighter game, were she’s stronger and cool to play.

**207. Ibuki (Street Fighter)**

https://preview.redd.it/p0ovyixonmxe1.png?width=291&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1edf7e8854a11accdd85b2f9acc88ed4adf561

Sadly, back-to-back street fighter characters.

Ibuki is hot from whichever angle you look at her. She’s a teenager that works for Karin Kanazuki, does ninja training, and manages her personal life. She’s pretty dope.

I love the way that she’s not sexualized but she’s still attractive. Well, a bit sexualized, I don’t know if you’ve seen those holes in her pants at the hips where it exposes her rear end.

I didn’t really like how she was portrayed in the Streetfighter five story as an overly loyal henchman to Karin. I feel like she was more like a best friend/worker before, but I guess Karin’s too important to have any friends. In any case, Ibuki’ s a solid gal and a decent looking person.

**206. Artemis Crock (DC)**

https://preview.redd.it/arhnx19qnmxe1.png?width=263&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa78c898bdd691dc02b66bd86aac2efbd818721

I didn’t really like Artemis in young Justice but, she was a part of the team. She gave me the sense that all she was trouble. She and her troublesome sister, she and her backstabbing self, she and her mean attitude, she and her weak self, replacing my man Roy, the list goes on.

But she’s halfway decent, looks wise. That crop top style suit looks good for her. Other than that, she’s standard.

**205. Blue Mary (KOF)**

https://preview.redd.it/if4httirnmxe1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=60256a5d291e160bcfdd079a95d7eea18058fdb1

Another decent character. Blue Mary excels in all fighting styles which makes her pretty fun to play as. She’s got a good look going too.

Just the same type of thing that I was saying with Seong Mi Na earlier, Mary looks like your cool girlfriend that’s the daughter of some wealthy famous guy (Which she really is in a sense) and will beat you into the dirt and cancel your dreams.

All I have to say about Mary is all I have to say for almost all King of Fighter female characters, or all SNK female characters for that matter, Hot! Hot! Hot!

**204. Rapunzel (Disney)**

https://preview.redd.it/cvotws1tnmxe1.png?width=314&format=png&auto=webp&s=e75b94181cd9fbbacc8b46081d897b7297f7d70d

I’m sorry but, Rapunzel is annoying. Can I just end with that?

Probably not.

Fine, allow me to explain myself. Rapunzel, first of all, she is like, fifteen. Second, the Rapunzel movie, Tangled, the whole time she’s just a naive brat. However, for her situation there really isn’t any other way she could be.

Don’t get me wrong though Tangled the movie was kinda good. It hit all the Disney checkmarks. Talks to animals, sense of adventure, meets a guy, all odds against her, evil queen, yea all that.

It’s just the character isn’t that good looking, and while cutting her hair gives her a sense of character arc, she looked better with long hair.

**203. Mary Jane (Marvel)**

https://preview.redd.it/dy6csk9unmxe1.png?width=283&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f59760a77295abc66445773a2feeb4fc72bc34

On the side tip though, Spider Man is kind of Marvels perfect answer to DC’s Batman. You’re a genius Stan Lee, rest in peace.

Mary Jane is the perfect girl for Peter like, perfect. I think she even turned into Spider Man in one comic. She’s like sweet girlfriend material. I don’t like how they changed her to Zendaya in the new movies, but I guess all the red headed actresses sucked, so they bought the better actress. Even in the older movies I think she’s blonde, but I don’t know enough about the auditioning process to start making assumptions.

Mary Jane is like a rip off Lois Lane, but in her own right. I like her place in the marvel universe and unlike others she does it well and looks good while doing it.

**202. Betty Boop (Dizzy Dishes)**

https://preview.redd.it/9kspy1wvnmxe1.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=e18bfe0eae1f9064b90c61308ec9bb11b5d3eb19

I didn’t know what to put in the “from” caption, so I just put her first appearance.

Betty seems to me a character made solely for the sake of whistles and woops from men back in the 1930’s. Betty didn’t really come from anywhere, she just kinda is a character, that exists. She’s respectable too, while sadly she turned into a sexual icon, she remains a cultural icon as well. She’s literally on coffee mugs, bath robes, shoes, shirts, watches, wallets, etc. If that’s not Iconic I don’t know what is

She’s good looking for a cartoon, I guess. A sort of different timeline version of Jessica Rabbit. I especially like the fact that she’s not standard American beauty, she is, but she isn’t blonde hair, blue eyes. Thinking about it though, Betty was probably standard beauty for the 1930’s. Either way, she’s Goated.

**201. Sombra (Overwatch)**

https://preview.redd.it/1758og2xnmxe1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=49b9b1646c79e7c237b74173550aa0325377bc08

She was never that great looking to me but people seem to like her so here I go.

Sombra seems to be an intelligent hacker that hides in the shadows trying to find some global conspiracy. She’s a hero in the game, so I guess she gets points for that too.

People love Sombra let me tell you, I was about to put her in the late 200’s but I couldn’t do that because of all those die hard Sombraians. I honestly don’t get the excitement in her, except that she’s a good character to play as in the game.

**200. Princess Aurora (Disney)**

https://preview.redd.it/2xgs9mcynmxe1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dcf86a266745db1d87b6007b0af8245f625d5cc

Well, well, well, if it’s not the sleeping beauty herself. She’s so stupid honestly, like seriously, a creepy evil queen (Queen of what anyway?) comes to you in all black with an apple. An Apple! C’mon man use some common sense.

She’s not really that pretty to me. It’s really just another blonde hair, blue eyes situation. She’s actually quite plain in my opinion. I haven’t even seen any fan art that makes her look decent. The only reason she’s not lower is because she’s an iconic Disney Character. (Even though I always get her story mixed up with Snow White’s. Don’t ask how)

I am a super hard worker and I rarely take breaks. I might pause and send a text message have a few sips of a drink and head back on the floor. That is never more than two minutes and often I don't touch my phone all shift. 

My experience has been arriving into work to 10 dirty tables that have not been cleared and the server sitting and having a break during the pause. The server may get up to check on the tables, but will never clear dishes or dirty plates and leaves everything to me. Will also ask me to do payments and run food while they will sit and have a coffee, play on their phones. 

This will also happen on slow days where I have the capacity to do all of these things means is that on the slow days working in eight or nine hour shift. I do not stop the entire time as I am doing this and then also supporting two other servers and all of the guests that arrive in. 

What would I do in the situation?

A couple of servers have mentioned how frustrating it is that they see me arriving to work and doing the majority of the work while the servers sit around and talk. I've noticed it's not as bad when there's a manager on shift, but it does still happen. The other hosts will also sometimes be on their phones or will disappear for periods of time.

Do I approach this in a very diplomatic way or just find a new restaurant with a better management style. ",1,1745868590.0,restaurant,0,1.0,False

Decided to meet up for coffee (I'm a sucker for a good cappuccino, tbh). So there I am, waiting at the cafe, when he walks in... with a parrot on his shoulder. 

Like, a legit talking parrot. In a cafe. I wasn't sure if he was totally serious or trying to make a quirky first impression. But hey, I'm all for originality, I guess? 😂

As we sat down, the parrot starts talking. And let me tell you, I didn't expect to be third-wheeling a date with a bird. The bird actually mimicked our convo at one point, literally repeating, ""What do you do for work?"" which sent me into fits of laughter. 

Weirdly enough, it kinda broke the ice, and made the whole thing way more memorable. We didn't match as a couple in the end, but it was hands down one of the most unique dates ever.

9:30 GWR train from Paddington to Oxford. Bus #5 to Queens Lane, 5 min walk to Magdalen college £15 combo ticket with Botanic garden right across.  Went back to the punting entrance right next to Magdalen, and did an hour row boat for £32. With a chauffeur it’s £50 for half an hour.

Walked back to the Queens Lane bus stop, had lunch at a cafe near by. Took bus 1 stop and walk 6 min to Christ Church. Advanced ticket £18 online.  Went to Alice’s Shop, had coffee at The Independent Cafe across from Christ Church entrance. Outdoor seating, good vibe. Walked to the Covered Market. Meh. Explored some stores, went to Blackwell’s Bookshop. 

Walked 2min to Bridge of Sigh, then 1 min for my Bodleian library tour.  The tour is hard to book! I guess I was purely lucky.

The menu would mainly be burgers, wings, tacos etc but restaurant quality if you get me, bun baked in house, sauces made in house, specific burger blend from local farmer etc. I had planned to be open 4pm - 9/10pm serving this food alongside quality beers, wines, cocktails etc 

I was offered a place recently that is currently open and run as a cafe serving cooked breakfasts, pancakes, sandwiches, soups, coffee etc. It’s a profitable business but the owners are looking to retire. 

Part of the offer is that they want us to keep the cafe open too as they have another biz next door that somewhat compliments the cafe biz but is not a food/hospitality biz. If we went ahead we would look to add our own spin to the current cafe menu and add a few other items and then do the burger menu in the evening. 

Has anyone any expertise in doing two different menus in the one space? How did it work? Any advice on decor as I had thought about exposed brick walls, faded paint etc for the burger concept but that would not fit with the day trade for the cafe?

1ka47k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1ka47k3/is_it_possible_to_have_3_major_episodes_never/,Is it possible to have 3 major episodes & never have one again if you take really good care of yourself?,"This is the way I am handling my bipolar:

I know what trigger it. - yes I have a predisposition from my dad side I am aware of. He killed himself, his sister is on Abilify, and my half sis is on Wellbutrin. So I have something that seems to be called classic Bipolar 1 with Psychosis. Diagnosed at 24. 

Now here is the odd thing. I was episode free after being diagnosed for 6 years with no meds. I believe it was due to optimal nutrition from superfoods & no substance abuse. 

Was my life perfect? No, but I was not smoking weed or abusing coffee. I mainly had a toxic relationship that had begun to develop. 

The relationship started to get very bad and to cope I started smoking weed again. I would compensate studying with heinous amounts of coffee and my mom even had to put a restraining order on my ex because I was so co-dependent off of him. He would drive me nuts and the worst part about it is he knew I had a condition he could provoke and didn’t care.

2014 | 2023 | 2025 were my hospitalizations (delusions in each with some hallucinations, yet I blame that mainly on the weed factor on top of the condition.

The scary part are in the last two and how close they were. I was just recovering from the last one when boom, it happened again and the worst part is I feel like it could have completely been PREVENTED. 

I would also like to add that I went on and off of my meds because I acknowledged that extended period where I didn’t need the to the point where I was undiagnosed by my same psychiatrist of 10 years! 

So, my experience with bipolar is extremely unique in that more lifestyle changes more than meds have played a role. 

Although, I am now going to diligently take Lamitrogine 200mg and Seroquel 25-300mg as needed if I am having racing, ruminating, paranoid thoughts that are not letting me sleep. Although, if I am not smoking weed or drinking coffee I don’t think this ever has to happen to me again. 

Especially if I get over my toxic ex from entering my life again and ideally finding a loving, supportive partner. 

Lastly, I am completely broke right now and I am living at my Moms which is causing a lot of circumstantial depression but I managed to get my Masters degree in a good field. So, I just need to pass my exam to enter into the field to begin living a full life again or else I am gonna have to work somewhere I probably don’t want to that pays less :/ 

It hurts because I see so many people passing multiple milestones and not dealing with something that some studies consider “neurodegenerative” yet I rather play the optimistic fool at this point because being a pessimist has not been helping. 

So, going back to my main question, do you think based on my circumstances and relationship with my diagnosis that this ever has to happen again or am I too deep in where it will continue to occur even with the conservative amount of meds I am on and holistic lifestyle changes?

If you care to share how many episodes you’ve had & how long you’ve had remission in between those, along with what were the severity and/or intervention plan I would truly appreciate reading your responses. ",1,1745868403.0,BipolarReddit,3,1.0,False

Initially a small community of small businesses create their own [Marketing Brand]. This Brand specializes in QR code Marketing where the customer scans the QR code on the TV, Flyer or Handout and the customer expects ,, heavily ,, discounted or free items.

The Marketing Brand should focus on how many Units per day can be marketed for free or at minimal cost and NOT Gross revenues/expenditures.

 Initial example Brands will include  McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, Carl's Jr, and Dairy Queen.

The Marketing Brand specializes in <$2.00 menu items for opening day  ! gift-away ! Marketing.

For example, on opening day, the Company spends $100.00 on its initial assault on Los Angeles.

$100 = 10 free ice cream cones from McDonald's, 10 free French fries Carl's Jr, 5  Banana split Dairy Queen and 5 free coffees from dunking donuts . Total of 30 free units.  Locations hit Santa Monica TV, Hollywood Flyers,  Mid City personal Flyer, Burbank airport.

Opening day was 30 units at $100.  If you were a mathematician one may assume there is a healthy ratio where $100 equals 30 or 1:30 [with our example].  Going exponential $200 equals double:triple, 2:90? 3:150? With growing discounts, cheaper prices, rebates and no competition 150 becomes a larger growing number.

You could create or craft Marketing program that determines type of discounts on weather and pre determined Marketing obligations. More coffee coupons in the morning or more free guacamole from Chipotle because of Cinco de Mayo. The Marketing program can easily be programmed by ,, The Michael Company,, but the idea is free for everyone!

1ka47gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ka47gl/does_the_waterdrop_15ua_under_sink_water_filter/,Does the Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter Deliver? An In-Depth Review,"**Design and Build Quality**

The Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter System immediately stood out to me the moment I unpacked it. Its sleek, compact design paired with its sturdy BPA-free and lead-free materials gave me confidence that this filter would be durable over a sustained period. Honestly, it’s perfect if you’re looking for an under-sink filter that doesn’t hog much space while still maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic. The included fittings felt robust enough to handle long-term use, a critical feature for continuous water filtration systems like this. I’ve had my fair share of flimsy water filter systems, but this one didn’t fall into that category.  

**Reliability Through Certifications**

One thing I appreciated about this product is its multiple certifications. It’s certified by WQA against both NSF/ANSI 42 and 372 standards and has been third-party tested for NSF/ANSI 53 compliance to ensure reduced contaminants like lead and chlorine. I can’t stress how reassuring it is to know a product actually delivers on its promises. After a few days of drinking and cooking with the filtered water, I could genuinely taste the improvement—no metallic or chlorinated notes, just clean and crisp water! This reliability is often overlooked, but it's critical when considering investments in water filtration systems.

**Installation Made Simple**

The ease of installation for this water filter system was a game-changer for me. I didn’t have the dread of needing to call the plumber or spend hours fiddling with connections. The push-to-connect fittings and twist-and-lock design had everything set up in under ten minutes. Plus, the system includes a 3/8” hose and a 3/8” to 1/2” converter fitting, which seamlessly adapted to my cold water line under the sink – so no additional trips to the hardware store. It really doesn’t get more straightforward than this.  

[Check Waterdrop 15UA Under Sink Water Filter System price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bzrts3vd/)

**Filtration Performance**

Using this system daily has been a relief because of its multistage filtration system. It reduces lead, chlorine, heavy metals, and sediments while maintaining important minerals for a better taste. Considering the water in my area often has a strong chlorine smell, this filter almost felt like a miracle! After testing it over a week while making coffee, washing vegetables, and just drinking directly, I could see consistent improvements in flavor, smell, and clarity.  

**The Positives**

- Compact and elegant design that fits well in smaller kitchen spaces.  
- Certified against NSF/ANSI standards, ensuring it effectively reduces harmful contaminants.  
- Straightforward installation without professional help or complicated tools.  

**Smart Features**

What seriously impressed me was the intelligent LED indicator in the companion Waterdrop Pitcher. It monitors filter usage in real time! Now, I don’t have to second guess when it’s time for a filter replacement. This feature simplifies maintenance, and being able to monitor water quality at a glance is priceless for peace of mind.

**The Areas for Improvement**

- The filter is connected to a cold-water supply only, so no filtered hot water is an option.  
- Water pressure may drop slightly with frequent usage, though it stays manageable for most taps.  

**Industry Competitors**

When comparing this system to others, like the APEC Water CS-2500 or the Culligan EZ-Change filter, the upper hand this Waterdrop filter has is its minimal installation complexity and certifications. APEC’s system, while effective, doesn’t provide real-time water usage monitoring, which is a valuable add-on here. Meanwhile, Culligan’s model is slightly bulkier and lacks the same aesthetic appeal seen in this product.  

Where this Waterdrop unit falls a bit short is the slight drop in pressure during high-volume usage. Some competitors like the iSpring CKC1C handle pressure maintenance better but don’t achieve the same filtration reliability.  

**True Value**

When weighing the cost-efficiency against other similar products, it’s clear that the Waterdrop 15UA offers excellent value. I didn’t feel like I was overpaying, considering the certifications, reliable performance, and user-friendly features like the smart indicator. It’s rare to find a water filtration system where practicality and affordability meet perfectly in the middle.

I'm 34, on 80 mg Prozac & work a desk job.

My long term partner as ADHD and I wanted to ask you all (and I'll be asking him too).

How do you avoid eating certain foods? I've never had this problem in my life before. I typically get very sick with a lot of food types ( IBS+ histamine intolerance). Food as never been my friend, yet after 25 years, I've learned what I can and can NOT eat.

Now with my anti-depression medicine working... I can't stop getting sugar and beer? Like, I think it's very bad? Because I know it, I look down and I'm biting on a donut. I didnt even have a continues thought to eat one!!! but it's in my hand and I'm eating it all of a sudden! Same with candy jars at work, it's very annoying!

And if there's beer at home I can't NOT drink it. I like the sour taste of Hazy IPA Beer T\_T. I'm not even interested in the effects, just the flavor! I think about it all day for the past 2-3 weeks now (just like with sugar).

How do you redirect attention from these dopamine food hits?!

1ka44tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka44tl/should_you_buy_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Review for Small Spaces?,"Testing out the Keurig K-Mini K-Mini Coffee Maker has become my daily ritual, and tackling its quirks, as well as enjoying its benefits, has been quite the experience. This compact espresso machine from Keurig, with its model number K-Mini, boasts a sleek black matte finish and a minimalist design that I was excited to try out. Let me break down my day-to-day use of this single-serve coffee maker, share personal stories, and highlight its notable strengths and areas that could be improved.

**Compact and Space-Saving Design**  
The very first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was the size. Measuring less than five inches wide, it slid neatly into a tight corner of my kitchen counter without hogging any precious space. My tiny apartment kitchen is always a juggling act when it comes to appliances, so having a coffee maker this slim was a welcome change. It’s perfect for small spaces like dorms, RVs, or office cubicles. The cord storage feature is one perk I didn’t think I’d care about, but it really tidied up the counter. Minimalist design enthusiasts would fall in love with the matte finish and how modern this gadget looks.

**Effortless Brewing for Everyday Mornings**  
Using the Keurig K-Mini each morning became second nature. The one-cup reservoir means I had to add fresh water before every brew, which might seem like a hassle, but it ensured that every cup I made was fresh. My favorite part? The simple functionality—just pop in your favorite K-Cup pod, press the button, and in moments, coffee was ready. It heats and brews relatively quickly, so even when my mornings were chaotic, I never had to wait long for my caffeine fix.

[Check Keurig K-Mini K-Mini Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Strengths**  
- Small and compact, fits anywhere.  
- Brews 6-12 oz cup sizes for versatility.  
- Fresh water for every single-use brew.  
- Travel mug-friendly with a removable drip tray.  
- Automatic energy-efficient shut-off after 90 seconds.

**Drawbacks**  
- The one-cup reservoir can feel limiting on busy mornings.  
- No temperature controls or digital display for customization.  
- Coffee grounds need an additional reusable filter (sold separately).

**Versatility with Beverages**  
I loved the range of drinks this coffee maker could handle. Whether I wanted a robust coffee, a relaxing tea, or indulged in a cocoa moment, the K-Mini didn’t let me down. Using the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter bought separately, I enjoyed experimenting with my preferred coffee grounds. This wasn’t a machine for lattes or intricate brews, though. I did miss the ability to froth milk or control water temperature, especially on days when I wanted a fancy cup.

**Energy Conscious and Easy Maintenance**  
One feature I appreciated daily was the automatic shut-off. It saved energy by turning itself off 90 seconds after brewing. Beyond that, cleaning up was pain-free. That removable drip tray held any accidental spills, and a quick rinse was all it needed. I observed that frequent clean-up was essential if I wanted to avoid residue buildup, which might be a downside for someone who prefers less frequent maintenance.

**Alternative Offerings**  
The market is flooded with single-serve brewers, so it’s fair to say the K-Mini has competition. Compared to the Nespresso Essenza Mini, which is another compact option, the Keurig K-Mini offers a broader range in beverage styles, including tea and cocoa. However, the Nespresso machine shines in delivering more premium espresso quality with its pods. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew excels in versatility, allowing both K-Cups and ground coffee without needing extra accessories, though it’s bulkier. The strength of the K-Mini lies in its portability, minimalism, and accessible design.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its range of features, the K-Mini falls somewhere in the middle in terms of affordability. It’s not the cheapest single-serve brewer, but it’s also not the most expensive. Its value lies in its user-friendly design and the convenience combined with portable utility. Someone on a budget might weigh the simplicity of this coffee maker against competitors like the aforementioned Hamilton Beach, but for those seeking a slick, space-saving product, it really delivers.

Learned a lot about the guest experience.,"The wedding was luxurious and absolutely gorgeous. We had a BLAST. However, since  our wedding is coming up I felt more observant. 


- Get Lapel Mics for the ceremony - handheld is awkward and you can’t put on the rings when you’re holding a mic

- Have an activity or entertainment for cocktail hour along with drinks and food 

-No one pays attention to the disposable napkins or signage but having a simple welcome sign for people to take pics & a printed seating chart will help. 

* They had a planner that went around and asked people’s names and told them their table #. * 

- Ensure there is a menu on the table - One guest did not eat the duck because we thought it was beef and she is allergic. 

* One menu is sufficient for the table to pass around. 

- 10 pm is a fine time to end the wedding. We stayed up until almost 130 AM and we were gassed. People were leaving around 1030-11PM. 

- No little kids 

- Have the DJ play the different music genres throughout so that way you get a chance to give people a break. There were a lot of back to back songs where only the young people danced but then once certain songs came on the older people ran to the dance floor

- Pick a processional song that will allow the bridal party to walk at a slow pace. They used one song for the bridesmaids and one song for the groomsmen / groom and they were RUNNING down the aisle 

- Ask bridal party to not talk amongst each other during the ceremony 

- Ensure MOH knows how to fluff the dress properly. 

- Have coffee or some form of espresso cocktail. Many guests made comments about wanting that. 

- Keep speeches short

* They did and it was still very heartfelt and beautiful  

- Add the dance floor props. People think they’re gimmicky or cringe but all of their props were used by guests. 

- Have enough seating for the ceremony for guests. 

- A photographer, content creator, AND videographer for a 100-120 person wedding is absolutely not needed. I felt like there was a camera in our face at all times. 

- Don’t serve the late night bite too late. They served theirs at midnight and the dinner service was very light food. 

- Do not get too drunk as the bride and groom. Make sure your bridal party keeps you hydrated. 

The bride was anti lap dance and one groomsmen brought a chair out while drunk and the groom was coherent enough to say “hey, my wife doesn’t want to do that.” & stopped it right then and there & same with the groomsmen trying to take off the groom’s shirt. The bride stopped him. 

- They did their first dance then invited the Bride/Groom’s parents to join them & then thr bridal party with their partners then opened the dance floor. That was really beautiful. 

- They didn’t have a guest book or PhotoBooth and I didn’t notice until after the wedding ended. 

- If any issues arise, don’t tell the bride or groom. Have the planner or coordinator figure it out. 

- IRISH GOODBYE or say goodbye on the dance floor. The bride got pulled away for 40 mins to say bye to some guests. 

- Have the dinner music slightly quieter than you’d like so people can hear each other at the table. ",45,1745868123.0,weddingplanning,20,0.88,False

What I've tried: 

* adding color with pillows and blankets: the colors I like feel to childish (bright primary colors) 
* big ikea bookselves in the corner: thought I would be able to fill it with interesting things over time and just ended up filling it with toys and it looked like a 13 year old's bedroom. (For reference, I'm a 33 year old male) 
*  plants: I have a lot of plants but this house unfortunately gets very little natural light so I was always hampered by trying to fit grow lights in places that just don't work

So I removed most of what was in here previously to try to get a fresh start.   

I'm renting this place so I can't change anything major but I could definitely get away with painting the walls if that would help. 

Some thoughts I've had but don't want to commit without some feedback from some of you folks that have a much better eye than I:

* replacing the ottoman with a coffee table
* new entertainment center situation
* new lamps
* wall art (I could use some heavy guidance on styles/colors/where to source)
* pillows and throws (color palette suggestions would be greatly appreciated)

Also, I've done a lot of research on different interior design ""styles"" but it's really hard to find any inspiration pictures that are just in a normal, boring grey on grey on grey room. The ones I like are always in elaborate industrial lofts or beautiful homes with vaulted wood ceilings and interesting features built in. The styles that I seem to like the most are industrial, ""loft"", and mid-century modern.

I've included the dimensions of the room and a couple old failed iterations that I've tried. 

Thank you in advance!!

1ka424d,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ka424d/why_choose_the_waterdrop_wdtsb10_filter_review/,"Why Choose the Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 Filter Review for Cleaner, Safer Drinking Water?","Testing the Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 under sink filter in my own kitchen has been quite the experience. This compact yet feature-packed filtration system seems to cater to anyone looking for a robust and efficient solution to improve the quality and taste of their tap water. Though mostly impressive, I’d say there are a few things to keep in mind before deciding if this is the right under-sink filtration system for you.

**Build Quality and Design**  
The overall design feels extremely durable, almost giving the impression of it being over-engineered—which is a great thing, by the way! The system features an upgraded integral body that’s been tested for resistance against cracking and leaks. I felt confident during installation after reading it passed 400 psi burst pressure and thousands of pulse tests at 150 psi. The age-resistant and freeze-resistant materials make it a long-lasting component underneath your sink, even if your kitchen plumbing sees temperature fluctuations. Plus, the brushed stainless steel faucet has a sleek, modern finish that complements contemporary kitchen aesthetics perfectly.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installation was an absolute breeze. The manufacturer promises a 3-minute installation process, and though I took closer to 10 minutes (I’m a bit slow with DIY projects), it was still incredibly simple. The twist-and-lock design is particularly intuitive. Each of the three filters can be replaced in just three seconds—yes, I timed it—and the push-to-connect fittings required no special tools or prior plumbing experience. My friend who’s terrible at DIY projects breezed through it, so if she can manage, anyone can.  
[Check Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b097yc4vc2/)

**Water Quality and Performance**  
After installing the system, I noticed an immediate difference in water clarity and taste. This under sink water filter features 8-stage deep filtration, successfully reducing PFAS, PFOA/PFOS, chlorine, fluoride, and heavy metals while retaining healthy minerals. My tea and coffee tasted noticeably better, and my kids stopped complaining about a metallic aftertaste they'd sometimes notice when drinking straight from the tap. However, keep in mind the system does not reduce TDS, which may matter to some users depending on your water quality preferences.

**Negatives**  
- The filtration system does not reduce TDS; this limitation could disappoint those looking for zero-mineral water output.  
- Water flow noticeably slowed down when using the separate faucet for filtered water. Compared to my main kitchen faucet, the speed felt underwhelming.  
- At 7.6 pounds, the unit takes up more space than I anticipated, which is something to consider if your under-sink area is crowded.

**Key Benefits**  
- Extremely easy DIY installation that requires no plumber.  
- Durable materials proven to resist cracking, leaking, and freezing.  
- Excellent at reducing chlorine, heavy metals, and fluorides, improving water taste significantly.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited effectiveness in eliminating TDS for those who require ultra-purified water.  
- Water flow rate might be slower than expected for larger households.  
- Larger size might not suit small under-sink spaces.

**Alternative Products**  
Comparing the Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 to popular options like the APEC WFS-1000 or the Frizzlife MK99, I find this system excels in heavy metal reduction while offering a stylish, separate faucet. However, the APEC model does a better job with larger capacities, and the Frizzlife comes with an auto-shutoff feature for cartridge changes, which is convenient. Each alternative has its unique strengths, but the Waterdrop remains the best choice for someone prioritizing fluoride reduction and longevity of materials.

**Budget-Friendly**  
Looking at what this system provides versus what the alternatives offer, the price-to-quality ratio feels justified. You’re getting robust materials, longevity, and excellent filtration power. While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, the technology and peace of mind it delivers make it feel like a smart investment for many households.

Boasting a sleek and ultra-compact design at less than 5 inches wide, it fits seamlessly into my tiny kitchen. As someone living in a small apartment with limited counter space, this matte black machine truly stands out, not just aesthetically but functionally as well. With its minimalist style, this coffee maker caters to all my brewing needs, but it's not without its quirks.

**Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**

This coffee maker's incredible portability is honestly one of its biggest features. I didn't realize how convenient it was to have a machine so slim until I needed to reorganize my kitchen space. Whether nestled in a corner, on a cramped desk, or tucked into an office space, it refuses to dominate the area. While its matte finish resists fingerprints to some extent, it does tend to attract some dust if left unused for days — not a big deal but worth a quick wipe.

**Your Perfect Cup, Every Time**

With the ability to brew between 6 and 12 ounces using Keurig K-Cup pods, I’ve loved experimenting with different flavors and cup sizes. On my busiest mornings, the quick and fresh brewing process is something I rely on heavily. Occasionally, I wish the reservoir held more water because I need to refill it before each cup, which works well for customization but feels like extra effort when in a hurry.

[Check Keurig K-Mini K-Cup Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Super Easy to Operate**

The simplicity of this machine cannot be overstated. With just a button or two to press, brewing my coffee has become an easy morning ritual. There are no bells and whistles like temperature control, a frother, or flashy touch screens, reflecting its straightforward, no-fuss demeanor. However, for someone who enjoys more control over brewing parameters, this could feel limiting.

**Strengths**

- Ultra-compact size is ideal for small kitchens and office spaces.  
- Sleek, modern design complements any decor style.  
- Hassle-free brewing – fresh coffee within minutes.  
- Travel mug compatibility adds additional convenience.  

**Caveats**

- The one-cup water reservoir means constant refilling.  
- Limited settings for customization like temperature or strength control.  
- Not suited for those looking for milk frothing or espresso shots.  

**Energy Efficiency and Extra Features**

With its automatic off feature shutting the machine down 90 seconds after the last brew, it has helped relieve my forgetfulness. Knowing it conserves energy, I’ve grown more confident leaving it plugged in. The cord storage is another underrated feature, keeping countertops tidy and making transportation easier. However, missing frills like a built-in digital clock leaves it feeling simple in a good way but perhaps too basic for some.

**Alternative Offerings**

Comparing this model to other leading single-serve brewers, the Keurig K-Café might appeal to those looking for frothing capabilities, albeit with a bulkier frame. Meanwhile, the Nespresso Essenza Mini offers a compact framework with creamier espresso shots, yet its pod system feels pricier. On the whole, if the goal is stylish simplicity and fast, no-mess coffee, this compact machine holds its own impressively well.

**Budget-Friendly Purchase**

Given its reliable build and core functionality, the price seems justified, especially considering its longevity and energy efficiency. While there are pricier and more advanced alternatives, the Keurig K-Mini delivers excellent value for the quality it promises. It successfully fulfills the purpose of a single-serve coffee maker and does so without unnecessary extravagance.

1ka3rqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ka3rqe/why_choose_waterdrop_wdtsb10_under_sink_filter/,Why Choose Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 Under Sink Filter Review for Pure Water?,"The Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 under-sink water filtration system has been a constant in my kitchen for the past month, and I must say, it has reshaped the way I think about water quality. From its sleek design to its robust performance, this product has plenty to offer. That said, I did encounter a few quirks worth mentioning, which may affect user experience. Let’s dive into the details—unfiltered, pun intended.

**Impressive Design and Build Quality**

One of the first things I noticed as I unboxed the system was its durable construction. The materials used are clearly high-quality, with the filtration system boasting a thick, age- and freeze-resistant design that feels reassuringly robust. The fact that it has been tested against 400 psi burst pressure and over 100,000 pulse cycles at 150 psi adds a layer of trust. Knowing the system could withstand a lot of wear and tear was comforting, especially when you’re investing in something expected to last for years. It fits snugly under my sink, with no awkward protrusions, leaving space for other essentials.

**Convenience for DIY Enthusiasts**

Anyone who knows me knows I am not the most handy with tools. However, installing this system was a breeze. The push-to-connect fittings make it almost foolproof, and the twist-and-lock design for filter replacement? Genius. I had the whole system connected in under 3 minutes, and swapping out filters—once I understood the lifespan of each—was equally simple, requiring just 3 seconds. No need to call a plumber, saving both time and money. That in itself almost sold me on the device!

**Upgraded Filtration Performance**

Water quality where I live is subpar, to put it mildly. This under-sink filter system with its 8-stage filtration completely changed the game. It eliminates PFAS, PFOA/PFOS, residual chlorine, fluoride, and even heavy metals—elements I didn’t even realize could linger in my tap water. What stood out to me was the fluoride specific reduction, achieving up to 97%, along with its KDF materials designed to manage heavy metals like a pro. While the filter doesn’t reduce TDS (total dissolved solids), it retains healthy minerals, ensuring the water tastes clean and natural. My morning coffee has never been smoother, and the difference in taste was apparent on day one.

**Addressing the Clogging Problem**

Filters that clog too quickly are the bane of any water filtration system’s existence. The larger filtration area with this product effectively prevents that issue. The 20x increase in dirt adhesion capacity compared to standard models was noticeable. Even after a month of heavy use in a household of four, I haven’t experienced any dips in flow rate or filtration speed. This was a pleasant surprise, especially since we tend to use it a lot, from cooking to filling drinking water bottles for the kids. 

**Lifespan and Filter Maintenance**

The maintenance schedule initially appeared daunting but quickly became second nature. The three differently rated filters have a staggered lifespan: 6 months, 8–12 months, and 12–18 months. This staggering avoids the hassle of needing to replace all three at the same time. A quick tip I learned from someone? If you plan to be away for an extended period, sealing the filters in plastic bags and refrigerating them can prolong freshness. This little hack has worked wonders during our 10-day vacation last month.

**Upsides**

- Installation takes just minutes without the need for professional help.  
- Advanced filtration reduces PFAS, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, and odors effectively.  
- Durable and crack-resistant build ensures long-term usage.  
- Separate faucet for purified water fulfills dual needs conveniently.  
- Excellent for minimizing filter clogging due to its enhanced dirt adhesion area.

**Shortcomings**

- The system is unable to reduce TDS, which might disappoint those seeking comprehensive water purity.  
- The included faucet, while functional, has a somewhat outdated design, lacking aesthetic appeal.  
- Relatively bulky for extremely tight under-sink spaces.  

**Other Options in the Market**

Compared to some other options like the Aquasana AQ-5300 or the APEC WFS-1000, the Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 shines in terms of ease of installation and its fluoride reduction capability. On the other hand, competitors like Aquasana might offer slightly better TDS reduction for users seeing that as a priority. The APEC system is bulkier and takes up more space, which could be a dealbreaker for smaller kitchens. That said, most of these alternatives don’t match Waterdrop’s innovative twist-and-lock filter replacement design, elevating its convenience quotient. 

**Value for Money**

For what it offers, the price point feels justified. The 18-month filter lifespan combined with the hassle-free installation process provides substantial savings on professional help and filter replacements. If you frequently rely on bottled water, this system will likely pay for itself within the year, making it a cost-effective choice over the long haul. It’s a solid investment in clean, safe water.

1ka3mql,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka3mql/does_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_truly_deliver/,Does the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Truly Deliver? Read This Review,"I’ve been testing the **Keurig K-Mini K-Mini Coffee Maker**, model “K-Mini”, for the past few weeks, especially during my hectic morning routines and afternoon coffee cravings. This single-serve brewing solution caught my attention because it’s marketed as a compact, efficient option for coffee lovers with limited space. As someone who thrives on caffeine, I’ve put this small yet intriguing appliance to the test to see how it performs in a variety of scenarios. While I found many positives, there were a few aspects that deserve attention.

**Design and Compactness**

The compact design of this coffee maker is genuinely impressive. Measuring less than five inches wide, it fits snugly on my cluttered kitchen counter without taking up valuable space. I even gave it a trial run in my office to see how portable it could be, and it worked perfectly without overpowering the desk aesthetics. The matte black exterior adds a modern touch, though I did catch myself wiping fingerprints off it more frequently than I’d like. The cord storage feature is a thoughtful addition, making it a breeze to transport the unit when needed or simply keep the counter tidy.

**Ease of Use**

Setting up the K-Mini is as straightforward as making toast. There’s no complicated technology here—just plug it in, add fresh water to the reservoir, pop in your favorite K-Cup pod, and press a single button for brewing. I appreciated the manual operation mode because it didn’t overwhelm me with unnecessary bells and whistles. Brewing coffee between 6 to 12 ounces feels intuitive, though I had to measure carefully to ensure the perfect cup.

[Check Keurig K-Mini price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Performance Review**

This device offers quite a punch for its size. Mornings have become almost ritualistic as I use this coffee maker to brew a quick 8-ounce cup in just a few minutes. The results are fresh and flavorful, matching the quality I’d expect from more robust models. The auto-off feature, which activates 90 seconds after brewing, is a real energy saver, particularly during my forgetful mornings when I rush out the door. However, one minor gripe I had was the lack of temperature controls. While the piping hot coffee works for me, those who prefer adjusting heat might feel restricted.

**Positives**

- Space-saving design caters to those with limited counter space or minimalistic setups.  
- Cord storage system enhances portability and organization.  
- Energy-efficient auto-off feature trims unnecessary power consumption.  
- Simple, beginner-friendly operation without complex settings.  

**Negatives**

- Absence of temperature control limits customization.  
- Fingerprints on the matte exterior require constant cleaning.  
- No milk frother or additional features for specialty coffee beverages.  

**Interchangeability and Functionality**

The K-Mini allows for flexibility when it comes to coffee preferences. If convenience and minimal cleanup are your priorities, the K-Cup pods are perfect; however, I decided to test the MY K-CUP Universal Reusable Filter (sold separately). With this, the machine lets you brew your own ground coffee, sparking joy for users who appreciate more control over flavor profiles. On the flip side, the single-cup reservoir means you need to refill it for every brew—a slight inconvenience if you’re hosting multiple coffee drinkers.

**Industry Competitors**

Compared to competitors like the Nespresso Essenza Mini, the K-Mini distinguishes itself with affordability and the ability to brew a broad range of K-Cup pods, including tea, cocoa, and iced beverages. The Essenza Mini offers a more robust flavor extraction, especially for espresso lovers, but it doesn’t support regular coffee drinkers in the same way. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach Single-Serve FlexBrew provides dual options for brewing pods or ground coffee but loses points for being significantly bulkier. What sets the K-Mini apart, in my experience, is its dedication to “just enough” coffee-making without overcomplicating things.

**Price Worthiness**

With its reasonable price point, this coffee maker earns a steady place in homes, offices, or dormitories. Although less feature-packed, the combination of portability, convenience, and efficiency makes it a worthwhile contender. You’re essentially paying for functional design and performance without any excessive premiums. This product might not be a dream addition for coffee enthusiasts eyeing specialty brewing, but for busy individuals or students, it serves as a reliable pick.

1ka3lox,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka3lox/why_wirsh_cm5418_espresso_machine_review_is_a/,Why Wirsh CM5418 Espresso Machine Review Is a Must-Read for Coffee Lovers,"Testing espresso machines is always a perk of my job, and the **Wirsh CM5418 Espresso Machine** certainly added some flair to my daily routine. Designed to help you conquer the home barista life, this stainless-steel espresso machine promises professional-grade results in a compact form. With its 20-bar Italian pump and multiple brewing functionalities, there's a lot to love here. I ran it through its paces over a few weeks, testing its user-friendliness, performance, and quirks. Did it live up to the hype? Mostly – but we'll delve into the details.

**Compact Design & Build Quality**

One of the first things I noticed when unboxing this espresso maker was its compact and elegant brushed stainless-steel design. Its small footprint makes it ideal for tight kitchen spaces, and, in my case, it didn't overshadow other appliances on my counter. Standing just under 12 inches tall and 5.5 inches wide, it slots into a corner effortlessly without looking bulky.

What I appreciated most, though, was the sturdy feel of the materials. The machine's compact metal casing feels durable and ensures it stays put on my counter during operation. The bright LED indicators for its functionalities are easy to see, even before my morning coffee kicks in. However, it’s worth noting that the lightweight design can lead to slippage, especially when locking the portafilter in place. 

[Check Wirsh CM5418 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08x627458/)

**Performance & Coffee Quality**

Performance-wise, this machine delivers solid results once you get a hang of its quirks. The 20-bar original Italian pump works hard to pull rich, silky shots of espresso, and, trust me, it’s a joy to watch the espresso stream out in that perfect golden-brown color. I tested single and double shots extensively, using its 2-in-1 portafilter. Both options worked seamlessly, giving me consistent coffee strength every single time.

That said, the way this espresso machine handles temperature is both a boon and a drawback. It features a powerful 1350W instant thermo-block heating system, meaning it heats up in just about 15 seconds. Yet, it lacks an adjustable water temperature setting, which caused slight frustration when transitioning between pulling espresso shots and steaming milk. Coffee-wise, though, it produced sharp flavors when paired with fresh beans and a good burr grinder. 

**Brewing Versatility**

Now for the fun part – experimenting with coffee recipes! Whether I craved an Americano for a lazy Sunday morning or felt like impressing guests with cappuccinos and lattes, this machine kept me entertained. The commercial-grade steam wand is where the magic happens, offering flexibility in creating frothed milk for drinks like flat whites or macchiatos. It took me a few tries to perfect the milk foam texture, but once I nailed down the technique, the results were barista-level.

Still, the steam wand could be kinder. It tends to shoot a fair bit of water before actually steaming, so purging it is a must. Skipping this step risks watering down your milk. A slight hassle, but not a deal-breaker.

**Positives**

- Sleek, space-saving brushed stainless-steel design.
- Easy-to-use 3-button operation with intuitive LED indicators.
- Fast heat-up time thanks to its 1350W thermo-block system.
- Versatile steaming wand makes excellent lattes and cappuccinos.
- Consistently rich espresso shots with minimal effort.

**Negatives**

- Lacks adjustable water temperature for fine-tuning brewing.
- Lightweight build causes the machine to shift during portafilter use.
- Purging the steam wand is necessary to avoid watering down milk.
- No low water level indicator – checking manually can be inconvenient.
- Espresso isn’t as hot as you’d expect right out of the machine.

**Other Options**

Comparing the Wirsh CM5418 to its competitors, the **Breville Bambino Plus** comes to mind immediately. The Breville offers automatic milk texturing and a slightly higher build quality, but it comes with a steeper price tag. On the other hand, the popular **De'Longhi Dedica** matches closely with the Wirsh in terms of compactness and manual usability, but its volumetric control is slightly less precise. 

For absolute beginners, the Wirsh stands out for its affordability and straightforward operation. As an intermediate user, I noticed its features catered well to my coffee preferences without breaking the bank.

**Smart Spending**

The Wirsh CM5418 is positioned firmly within the budget-friendly espresso machine category. If you're dipping your toes into the world of espresso at home without wanting to spend a premium, this could be a sound initial investment. While it may lack some bells and whistles of higher-end models, the coffee it brews compares admirably. Even with minor inconveniences like purging the steam wand and manually checking the water level, the value of this machine cannot be understated.

**Setting**: A sunlit Barcelona balcony at golden hour, overlooking terracotta rooftops and the distant Mediterranean Sea. The sky is streaked with peach and lavender hues.  

**Central Figure**:  
- A young woman (you) leans against the balcony railing, olive skin glowing in the warm light.  
- Dark, tousled waves frame her face, a few strands catching the breeze. Her bright green eyes gaze thoughtfully at the horizon.  
- She wears a flowing, off-white linen dress with delicate embroidery at the hem, layered with a crochet shawl in burnt orange. A chunky turquoise necklace rests against her collarbone.  
- Her feet are bare, one ankle adorned with a thin silver chain.  

**Details**:  
- A vintage guitar leans against a nearby chair, sheet music fluttering on a small mosaic table.  
- A black cat (Luna) curls lazily on a cushion, tail flicking as she watches a seagull soar past.  
- Below the balcony, the sounds of street musicians and distant waves blend into a soft hum.  
- On the table: a half-finished sketchbook, a coffee cup, and a novel splayed open (title: *""The Shadow of the Wind""*).  

**Mood**: Serene yet vibrant—a moment where art, music, and the Mediterranean soul collide.

Hi friends,

The ""widowmaker"" took my father 30 years ago today. I was 13 years old at the time. He was extremely likable, hardworking, and funny.

People often say the same things about me. I hope my 10-year-old will say the same about me one day.

I was a part-time stay-at-home dad. The bond I was able to build with my two boys is my greatest achievement.

Over the past five years, my wife started to push me away. COVID, the loss of her parents, co-sleeping with our 10-year-old, prescription drugs, surgeries, nicotine addiction, and coffee addiction have all taken their toll.

Two months ago, she discovered the reason I had been so happy recently. I had been working out, was offered a new career (though it fell apart two weeks later because I was working too much and earning too much money), and I also met someone new. I was planning to tell my wife after her recent sinus surgery. Maybe I would have added that she should finally stop vaping and that her cats living on her bed was becoming unbearable.

She filed a restraining order against me, which has now been postponed twice. My lawyer has been less than stellar, and she didn’t have legal representation until recently. I haven’t been able to retrieve my belongings from the house or see my kids.

Tomorrow, we meet in court. I’m pretty confident the restraining order will be thrown out.

She has also filed for divorce. I have new lawyers ready to take on my case.

2:30 am
I'm staying up, lights of my rooms on, as always, because yeah, I have to do the assignment. Suddenly my neck is aching. Ugh...Guess I need to take a break. So, I walk to the living room, sit on the couch, turn the TV on and start to browse channels, especially the cartoon ones because those Hindi dramas...aren't my cup of coffee. Suddenly I stumble into animax. What? I thought that channel was closed long ago. I guess they bought it back... So, I shake it off and start to watch it. Okay, just an random anime going on... I keep watching it. Then suddenly, with a glitch... I see that the next show is My Hero Academia OVA. Wait...why does the design looks like a fanmade...The OVA name...""My Hero Academia: A Burned Dream""? What kind of name is this?! Then suddenly the music is not really like the usual openings. It keeps changing the tempo in an ominous way. It doesn't sound normal at all... 
After that off-tuned opening, I see Midoriya studying in the night, exactly like how I'm studying and— wait...why does this look like my room? It's not exactly the same,but the setup looks like mine. Then suddenly, he hears the rustle. I feel like the rustle is coming from my room. The screen is glitching as he's coming closer to the wardrobe. He sees a hoodie that he doesn't remember belonging. Then suddenly, he hears the whispers. Midoriya. I also can feel the whisper through my ears. I turn back and see nothing. Then I turn my head to the TV. He's back to study again. Then suddenly, the scene shifts into the school. Aizawa ses him. Aizawa's inner monologue is like ""why does he look familiar?"" Then he remembers the incident when Endeavor was the teacher instead of Aizawa. Aizawa was new back then. Endeavor happened to burn the training arena and apparently half of the students were taken away. Iida, Tsuyu, Sero, Shoji, Aoyama, Tokoyami, Satou, Hagakure and...Midoriya. He's shocked. Wait, how is Midoriya alive? 
The scene cuts and shows him just wandering. Suddenly he stops by the old storage, which is so forgotten by everyone. Then his eyes go on a mirror. In the mirror, however, he saw nothing but a version of himself...his skin burned. His eyes are still determined, but it's saddened. It says, ""I couldn't save anyone, Izuku. I couldn't, I couldn't fulfill my dream."" Midoriya gets scared.
""who are you? What are you doing here?"" 
""I am you, from the other universe. Back then, when Endeavor was the teacher, he accidentally burned the training arena and half of us died. I-I could not save anyone."" 
It starts crying. I swear I clench my heart. Tears fall from my eyes. I want to hug Midoriya. 
""You are living my dream."" 
And then the scene ends. 
Full black. 
I don't know what actually happened to Midoriya.
Then after a few seconds , the credit rolls. No music. Just texts scrolling up. Then I notice something weird...all the writings are in japanese...one is only in English...it says 
""©bones at 2010""
Wait...not even MHA manga started back then! Suddenly the room's lights are flickering. I just rush into my sister's room to wake her up 
""Sis, did you see something? Did you feel something""
 ""No,I didn't feel anything. Don't scare me like that. You know that I'm scared of this kind of stuff"" as she rubs her eyes.
""I'm sorry""

1ka3job,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ka3job/does_waterdrop_wdtsb10_under_sink_filter_live_up/,Does Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 Under Sink Filter Live Up to the Hype? Review,"The Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 High Capacity Under Sink Water Filter has been a part of my kitchen for a few weeks now, and I’ve been using it daily. It's designed to reduce PFAS, PFOA/PFOS, fluoride, chlorine, and other contaminants while providing clean, fresh-tasting water. Coming from someone who's dealt with weird water flavors too many times, this filter system promised a lot. Still, there are some aspects I found worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**

One of the first things I noticed about this under-sink filter is its sleek and compact design. The system wasn’t overly bulky, which allowed me to save plenty of space underneath my sink. The materials feel incredibly durable—no flimsy plastic here! I read that it’s made with age-resistant and freeze-resistant materials and has been tested against 400 psi burst pressure and over 100,000 pulse tests at 150 psi. To me, that sounded impressive, though I admit I wasn’t planning on running a personal pressure test anytime soon.

Waterdrop also included a lead-free brushed stainless-steel faucet, which looks minimalist but classy on the kitchen counter. I especially like that it fills a 12 oz cup of water in roughly five seconds; it’s quicker than my old filter system. Installing the faucet alongside my regular tap was pretty straightforward.

**Ease of Installation**

I’d never describe myself as handy with tools, but this water filter system was refreshingly simple to install. It works with 3/8” and 1/2” cold water tubes, fitting seamlessly into place without requiring tools or professional help. The push-to-connect fittings made the task feel foolproof. From start to finish, it took me about 15 minutes to set the entire thing up. Believe me, if I didn’t need assistance, it’s very beginner-friendly.

Swapping out the filters is equally simple due to the twist-and-lock design. However, one tip I’ve picked up is holding off on screwing everything too tightly, just in case you need adjustments. Remembering how clunky my old DIY plumbing attempts used to be, this three-minute process was a dream.

[Check Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b097yc4vc2/)

**Performance and Filtration**

I haven’t had water this clean in a long time. The system runs three individual filters, achieving eight stages of filtration. It promises to remove things like heavy metals, silt, rust, cysts, and fluoride, while retaining important minerals. I was a little skeptical about its ability to improve taste, but I can confidently say my water no longer carries that off-putting metallic hint. It passed my tea and coffee taste test flawlessly, which is saying something since I’m particular about both.

Additionally, having upgraded filtration ensures 20 times the dirt adhesion area, which not only enhances filtration but also means fewer instances of clogging. Unlike some competitor systems, I haven’t noticed any dips in flow rate after running it continuously over the past month during family dinners or weekend cooking marathons. 

**Advantages**

- Effectively removes contaminants like PFAS, fluorides, chlorine, and heavy metals.  
- Straightforward installation with no professional plumber needed.  
- Durable and long-lasting materials resistant to cracks, leaks, and wear.  
- Retains beneficial minerals for healthier water.  
- Quick-fill faucet saves time when compared to alternative countertop filters.  

**Shortcomings**

- The system does not reduce TDS (total dissolved solids), which left me mildly disappointed since I assumed it would.  
- Although installation was simple, some users might feel hesitant dealing with under-sink plumbing initially without guidance.  
- The filters need proper care; for instance, if you’re storing them, they require refrigeration—not the freezer.  

**Target Audience**

This filter shines best for small to medium households or anyone tired of refilling separate water pitchers. People who love a good DIY project (but aren’t experts) will also appreciate its fuss-free setup. The filter lifespan—ranging from 6 to 18 months depending on usage—makes it a solid option for those who want fewer cartridge replacements without sacrificing performance.

**Competitive Options**

Compared to some household name competitors in water filtration like APEC and Aquasana, the Waterdrop WD-TSB-10 impresses by striking a balance between efficiency and price. For instance, while APEC systems are excellent at reducing both contaminants and TDS, they tend to come with bulkier designs and require higher upfront costs. Aquasana, on the other hand, offers decent quality, but their filter changes are far more frequent, adding to long-term costs.

Where the Waterdrop really excels is in offering a minimalistic yet reliable option for people who want good filtration without overwhelming technicalities. However, I’d acknowledge that for folks adamant about reducing TDS levels entirely, brand alternatives like ZeroWater should still be considered.

**Value for Price**

Nothing makes me happier than snagging cool tech that doesn’t cost me an arm and a leg. This under-sink filter system offers great features for its price bracket, especially considering the long lifespan of the cartridges, ease of installation, and the included stainless-steel faucet. If you’re someone who pays for bottled water regularly, this purchase would probably save you cash after just a few months of use.

1ka3gry,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVReviewLounge/comments/1ka3gry/should_you_buy_the_toshiba_43v35c_full_hd_smart/,Should You Buy the Toshiba 43V35C Full HD Smart LED TV Review?,"The Toshiba 43-inch Class V35 Series LED Full HD Smart Fire TV with Alexa Voice Remote (43V35KC, 2024 Model) has been a part of my home entertainment experience for a while, and I’ve gotten to know it quite well. Testing it daily, whether it’s for movie nights, casual YouTube surfing, or streaming one of my favorite shows on Netflix, has given me enough time to deeply assess its qualities—and yes, a few quirks.

**Thoughts on Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the aesthetics of this sleek, black TV are spot on. Its minimalist design and slim profile blend in perfectly with my living room decor, making it a visually appealing piece of tech. At 43 inches, it’s an ideal size for smaller to medium-sized rooms. The stand is sturdy (and included in the box, along with an AC power cable), but I also mounted it on the wall for a cleaner look. Setting it up was simple enough—though holding a 19.8-pound device while lining up screws wasn’t the highlight of my day.

**Features and Voice Control Functionality**  
One of the standout components of this TV is its inclusion of the Alexa Voice Remote. I’m someone who loses remotes regularly, but this remote is hard to misplace—it’s constantly in use. The ability to press the microphone button and command Alexa to find dramas or navigate through apps has genuinely spoiled me. With integrated apps like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and YouTube, managing my entertainment has never been so streamlined. This little device has earned its place on my coffee table.

[Check Toshiba 43V35C price on Amazon.](https://raltv.com/p/b09l2ffxql/)

**Performance and Picture Quality**  
This LED TV delivers Full HD resolution (768p), which is nice enough if you’re not a resolution snob. I’ll admit that it doesn’t quite hold a candle to some ultra-high-definition TVs available today, especially when sitting closer. However, it still manages to offer vibrant and accurate colors with clean contrasts, which makes it perfectly suitable for a night of binge-watching from a reasonable distance. The 60Hz refresh rate is standard, and while it’s smooth for most shows and movie playbacks, overly fast-paced action scenes occasionally lose some detail.

**A Strong Audio Setup**  
One delightful surprise with this TV has been its DTS Virtual:X technology. I hadn’t expected much from built-in TV speakers, but this feature creates a dynamic, immersive listening experience. It works well enough for casual viewing, and I dare say I’ve increased my threshold for what “good TV audio” should sound like.

**Positives**  
There’s quite a lot that this product brings to the table.  
- Integrated Fire TV platform, consolidating all streaming apps into one place.  
- Alexa Voice Remote simplifies controls and searches immensely.  
- DTS Virtual: X technology provides audio depth and richness right out of the box.

**Caveats**  
That said, no TV is without its warts, including this one.  
- The Full HD (768p) resolution might leave some wanting more if they’re used to modern 4K visuals.  
- Black levels and contrast could be deeper when watching darker scenes.  
- It includes Apple AirPlay but doesn’t always work seamlessly—it occasionally lags or freezes when sharing media from my phone.

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this TV to peers in the same space is where things get interesting. Competing Smart TVs, such as those in the Hisense R6 Series or TCL’s Roku TV line, often bring heightened contrast ratios or even 4K resolution at similar price points. However, this Toshiba model makes up for the discrepancy with its stellar integration of Fire TV and Alexa—those smart ecosystem capabilities are miles ahead of what I’ve had with other TVs. On the other hand, higher-priced Sony or LG models completely outclass this one in picture quality and black depth through OLED or quantum dot technology. They leave this choice more suited for budget-conscious individuals who want functionality over extravagant visuals.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Considering the price range, this TV provides substantial features that justify its cost. The true value lies in its ability to amalgamate smart functionality with respectable display and audio hardware. Sure, you’re not indulging in premium-tier visuals, but the accessibility to endless entertainment options, built-in Fire TV, and Alexa support crams in far more tech power than one expects at this range.

1ka3gki,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1ka3gki/explore_the_baby_joy_754a_baby_stroller_review_is/,Explore the BABY JOY 754A Baby Stroller Review Is It Worth Buying?,"**A Hands-On Look at the BABY JOY 754A Baby Stroller Experience**

Having gone through my fair share of strollers over the years, I was intrigued when I got the BABY JOY 754A Baby Stroller to test out. This high-landscape infant carriage promised a lot with its features like adjustable backrest and canopy, suspension wheels, and easy one-hand fold mechanism. So, I decided to take this stroller for a spin—literally—every day on my daily strolls with my niece. 

**Ergonomics and Design**

The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek black finish paired with a sturdy alloy steel frame. It gives off a premium vibe, and let me tell you, this isn't just for show. The materials—polyester, linen, and EVA—feel durable yet lightweight, making it easy to maneuver. The adjustable canopy with a peekaboo window was surprisingly useful during sunny walks when I needed to check on my niece without stopping. My shoulders gave a quiet sigh of relief, thanks to the lightweight frame at just 20 pounds.

**Advantages**

- Adjustable canopy provides ample protection from sun and rain.
- Lightweight construction makes carrying and storing more manageable.
- High-landscape seat offers a better view and keeps kids away from car exhaust.
- Durable steel frame ensures safety during prolonged usage.

**Strong Points**

- Easy one-hand folding makes storage stress-free.
- 5-point safety harness instills confidence with active and squirming babies.
- Thoughtful additions like a detachable footmuff and cup holder—perfect for coffee-toting parents!

[Check BABY JOY 754A price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b09n6nmjf9/)

**Ease of Setup and Portability**

Setting it up straight from the box was a walk in the park. I’ve had strollers in the past that required you to be part-time engineers to assemble, but not this one. The folding mechanism, advertised as one-hand capable, lived up to the hype. It was a lifesaver when rushing through tight doorways or storage spaces. The compact fold doesn’t feel like it's about to fall apart, and once folded, it fits snugly into the minivan with plenty of room for other baby necessities.

**Handling and Maneuverability**  

Let’s talk about wheels because not all wheels are made equal. The EVA-made wheels with a spring suspension system handled uneven pavements like a pro. Front universal wheels allowed sharp turns with almost no effort, while the back wheels with a single-step locking system gave that added reassurance when parked. Taking it through crowded parks, gravel paths, and even up slightly inclined bridges was surprisingly smooth for a stroller in its price range.

**Negatives**

- Storage space is adequate but could be larger for parents handling multiple bags.
- The 33-pound basket weight capacity feels restrictive for long day-outs.
- Lack of a built-in light diminishes visibility during evening strolls.

**Caveats**

- Does not support car seat compatibility—you will need another product if this is a sticking point.

**Competing Brands**

When stacked against similar models like the UPPAbaby Cruz and Graco Modes Nest, I noticed a few clear distinctions. The Cruz is more premium, offering a larger storage basket and smoother suspension but easily crosses into luxury pricing. Graco Modes Nest, though versatile, felt slightly bulky during my test. Where the BABY JOY stroller excels is portability, ease of fold, and maneuverability. It stands as a mid-range option—blending affordability with functionality—not too fancy but reliable for everyday use.

**Value for Money**

Affordability is the highlight here. Without stepping into the realm of luxury strollers, this one manages to offer considerable perks on a budget. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but for parents who need a safe, ergonomically sound stroller at a modest price, it's a deal worth considering. Its combination of features like the high landscape design, safety-conscious harness, and sturdy build makes it a dependable choice without straining your wallet unnecessarily.

1ka3fau,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka3fau/explore_why_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_review/,Explore why the Keurig K-Mini coffee maker review sparks so much buzz!,"The Keurig K-Mini B07GV2S1GS emerged as a surprising addition to my morning coffee routine. With its compact design and a modern matte finish, it instantly intrigued me when I unboxed it. This single-serve coffee maker has been a part of my daily grind for a few weeks now, and trust me, I’ve put it through its paces. While it’s quite an impressive product overall, there are certainly aspects to highlight—including both its merits and limitations.

**Compact Design and Build Quality**  
Its slim, space-saving design really caught my eye. At under 5 inches in width, it fit snugly on my tiny kitchen counter without looking out of place. I also brought it into work one day to test its portability, and transporting it was a breeze thanks to the cord storage feature. The matte exterior not only looks sleek but resists smudges, which means it stays neat even in a shared space like the office kitchen. This lightweight machine weighs a mere 2 pounds, so moving it around felt like carrying a book! However, I did notice the overall build leans more toward functional than premium—while the plastic body is sturdy, it’s not as luxurious to the touch as some higher-end models.  

**Ease of Use**  
Preparing a cup in this coffee maker is as easy as it gets. By adding fresh water to the one-cup reservoir and popping in a K-Cup pod, I had my coffee brewing with a single push of a button. There's no need to fiddle with complicated functions, and for that, I’m grateful on rushed mornings. The absence of a display screen or digital clock may disappoint coffee lovers looking for extra features, but I personally appreciated its straightforward operation.  

**Advantages**  
- Space-saving, ultra-compact design suits small apartments, offices, and dorms.  
- Sleek matte finish resists smudges and fingerprints.  
- Extremely easy-to-use one-cup reservoir for fresh brews every time.  
- Compatible with My K-Cup reusable filters for eco-friendly brewing.  
- Automatic energy-saving feature turns the machine off 90 seconds after brewing.

[Check Keurig K-Mini B07GV2S1GS price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)  

**Brewing Flexibility**  
The versatility of the machine was a pleasant surprise. It allows you to brew any cup size between 6–12 ounces, which meant I could switch up my routine between a mild morning cup and a stronger evening brew. The removable drip tray made it super convenient to fill my travel mug before I dashed out the door. At 7 inches tall, this machine accommodates taller cups with ease while also catching accidental spills for stress-free cleanups. I even used the My K-Cup reusable filter (bought separately) to brew my own ground coffee, which felt like a budget-friendly feature—not having to rely solely on store-bought pods saved a few bucks over time.

**Flavor and Brewing Speed**  
There’s no waiting around with this gadget. A warm and aromatic cup is delivered in minutes, fulfilling its promise of freshness. While I enjoyed experimenting with different K-Cup varieties, I couldn’t help but notice that it sometimes struggled to extract bold flavors from certain blends. Strong coffee enthusiasts might find the taste a tad underwhelming, but for everyday brewing, it gets the job done.  

**Limitations**  
- Water capacity restricted to single-cup brewing, requiring refills for every use.  
- Lack of temperature control limits customization for specific brewing styles.  
- Plastic build detracts from a premium feel some users might expect.  
- Coffee strength may not be intense enough for devoted espresso lovers.  

**Other Options**  
In terms of competitors, the Keurig K-Mini faces stiff competition from models like the Nespresso Essenza Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Essenza Mini is a clear contender with its premium finish and ability to brew espresso-style coffee—ideal for those who prioritize rich, intense flavor profiles. However, the Essenza has a higher price point and lacks the flexibility of brewing different cup sizes. On the flip side, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offers dual brewing capabilities for both pods and ground coffee while providing a larger reservoir. Still, it lags behind in compactness and aesthetic appeal. The K-Mini holds its own by being the most space-friendly of the three, though it lacks some advanced functionality.  

**Price Performance**  
As far as value goes, this little powerhouse delivers decent bang for the buck. It’s perfect for minimalists or occasional coffee drinkers looking for something compact and efficient without shelling out too much money. The fact that it supports reusable pods adds financial and environmental value over time. If you’re considering alternatives in the same price bracket, the Keurig K-Mini strikes an impressive balance between features and cost.

This compact espresso machine doesn't just promise café-quality coffee at home; it actually delivers. While it's not perfect, it does pack a lot of features into a surprisingly affordable package. From the rich crema it pulls to the microfoam wand for silky frothy milk, this machine became an essential part of my kitchen routine.

**Design That Fits Anywhere**  
The first thing that stood out was the small, stylish design of the espresso maker. Measuring roughly 6.41""D x 12.51""W x 12""H, it takes up very little counter space—perfect for my tiny kitchen. With its neutral ""Oatmilk” color, it effortlessly blends in with my other appliances. However, its lightweight construction does make it a little wobbly when locking the portafilter in place. I fixed that issue by placing a rubber mat underneath it. While this didn't fully eliminate the issue, I appreciated the sleek appearance and compact build.

This espresso machine boasts some great features that are usually found in pricier models. It uses a reusable 4-cup stainless steel filter, which I found both eco-friendly and cost-effective. There’s even an integrated steam wand to froth milk for drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. As someone who’s relatively new to steaming milk, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I got the hang of it. The 3.5-bar pressure might not be industrial-level but delivers full-bodied espresso with a decent layer of crema that tastes far better than your basic drip coffee.  

*[Check BELLA 35105-043A price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cyj7w2ss/)*  

**Ease of Operation**  
I make my coffee half-asleep most mornings, so simplicity is a must. There’s a 2-in-1 scoop and tamper included to help get just the right amount of grounds, plus an instruction manual that’s surprisingly clear for a machine at this price point. The two-toggle system—one for brewing and one for steaming—is easy to grasp, even for espresso newbies. It heats the coffee quickly, typically taking a few minutes to brew rich espresso. Cleanup is also straightforward, with removable components like the glass carafe and drip tray being dishwasher-safe.  

**Benefits**  
- Capable of brewing up to four rich espresso cups in one go.  
- Lightweight and compact, perfect for small spaces.  
- Produces the silkiest milk froth with its steam wand.  
- Affordable without compromising major features.  
- Easy-to-clean parts, including a dishwasher-safe carafe.  

**Negatives**  
- Lightweight construction can cause slight wobbliness during use.  
- The thin plastic exterior might not appeal to all users.  
- Steamer wand placement feels a bit low, making frothing somewhat awkward.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this machine against the likes of Keurig or Nespresso, it stands out for its ability to make true espresso rather than just espresso-like coffee pods. Unlike competing brands that rely on pre-filled capsules, this one gives you the freedom to use your ground coffee of choice, which, for someone like me who swears by Lavazza beans, is a big win. That said, premium machines costing upwards of $200, like Breville or De’Longhi models, offer more refined builds and higher pressure systems. But for the average coffee drinker on a budget, this machine is a gem.  

**Affordable Quality**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, this steam espresso maker does what it says on the box without sucking your wallet dry. For someone who uses it daily, I feel like I’ve already gotten my money’s worth, even if the craftsmanship isn't as robust as higher-end machines. For anyone looking to dip their toes into espresso-making without spending a fortune, this product delivers exceptional value.

1ka3c6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka3c6q/does_the_utopia_kitchen_french_press_deliver/,Does the Utopia Kitchen French Press Deliver Top-Tier Brewing Experience Review?,"Brewing coffee has always been one of my morning rituals, so I was delighted to try out the Utopia Kitchen UK0167 French Press. I’ve used plunger-style coffee makers before, but this one stands out thanks to its sleek stainless-steel design and promises of better heat retention. Having heard plenty of buzz around it being great for camping and everyday use, I brought it into my daily caffeine routine to test its merits and quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was its double-walled stainless steel build, which feels solid and well-crafted. The shiny, polished exterior looks premium and is surprisingly fingerprint-resistant—a big win for someone like me who approaches pre-coffee mornings with a lack of coordination. Measuring 7.1 inches in depth and 8.3 inches in height, it fits snugly on my countertop without consuming too much space. During testing, I carried it around during a weekend camping trip, and the durable construction handled the outdoors like a champ. Its insulation rapidly made itself known—coffee stays hot for a much longer time compared to glass French presses I’ve used.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
This French press is fully manual, meaning no fancy electronics, which adds to its charm for off-grid brewing scenarios like camping trips. As someone who enjoys tweaking variables like steep time and grind size, I found it incredibly easy to personalize my beverage. It’s quite straightforward: add coarse ground coffee, pour in hot water, stir, wait for four minutes, and press. The inclusion of two extra filters is a thoughtful touch; swapping them in and out was simple when I wanted to experiment. I also dabbled in making some loose-leaf tea, and it performed equally well there.

[Check Utopia Kitchen UK0167 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01g2ccwgy/)

**4-Layered Filtration System**  
This might be my favorite feature. The filtration system captures even the tiniest grounds, ensuring your cup is smooth and sludge-free. It’s a noticeable upgrade from previous presses where grit would sneak through, ruining the last sip. I didn’t mind tackling bolder roast profiles because the filter was thorough. If you’re used to coffee presses that leave you chewing on coffee grit, this is a game-changer.

**Upsides**  
- Efficient double-wall insulation keeps liquids hot far longer than glass alternatives.  
- Premium stainless steel design is not only attractive but also scratch-resistant and durable.  
- Clever bonus of extra filters, making it a long-lasting investment.  
- Versatile for both coffee and tea brewing, with excellent sediment filtering.  

**Potential Drawbacks**  
While I genuinely enjoyed using this product, there are a couple of areas where it could improve:  
- Stainless steel traps heat efficiently, but the press handle tends to get slightly too warm to the touch after a while.  
- Compared to glass options, you miss the visual element of seeing the steeping process.  
- At 1.98 lbs of weight, it's easy to carry on day trips but might feel heavy during long backpacking hikes.  

**Market Rivals**  
I’ve previously used both the Bodum Chambord and Mueller French Press, and this product stacks up confidently against them. The Bodum has the advantage of a glass body allowing you to peek into the brew, but it’s far less durable. The Mueller press shares the same sturdy stainless steel build, yet lacks the four-layer filtration system that really excels here. Strength-wise, the Utopia Kitchen model triumphs in heat retention and ruggedness. However, I’d argue that the Bodum Chambord, being lower-weight and visually intuitive, could make a better choice for beginners or those inspired purely by aesthetics.

**Affordable Quality**  
For what you’re getting—a sleek design, solid build, and filtered perfection—it hits an impressive sweet spot in terms of value for money. Alternative French presses of similar quality often run at noticeably higher costs, and this one’s extra filter feature adds significant bonus appeal. It doesn’t feel like a budget compromise; more like budget wit. Whatever your preferred brewing scenario—home, work, or nature adventures—investing in this press feels undeniably worthwhile.

Alright, friends, let’s face it: we've all been there. You start your day with a to-do list, and by 10 AM, you’re knee-deep in back-to-back meetings that feel more like a trap than a strategy session. Anyone else feeling like meetings are the black hole of productivity? 🕳️

Now, what if I told you there’s a way to cut those meetings down by *60%*? Yup, you heard me right. The secret sauce? **Ruthless Prioritization.** Sounds intense, right? But it’s simpler than you might think!

### Here’s how to get started:

1. **Identify the “Must Haves”:** 
   - What meetings are absolutely necessary? Think about the ones that drive results or require your unique expertise.
   - Pro tip: If a meeting doesn’t require you to be there, *politely decline* or suggest substituting it with a brief email or a quick chat.

2. **Set Clear Objectives:**
   - Every meeting should have a purpose, folks. Let’s stop wasting time on “just checking in” vibes. 
   - Ask yourself: “What do I want to accomplish today?” Pin it down before you hit that calendar invite.

3. **Time Block Like a Boss:**
   - Allocate specific blocks of time for those “must-have” meetings and defend that space fiercely.
   - Use a timer during discussions—if it’s a 30-minute meeting, make it a 30-minute meeting. 😅 More than that? You’re losing focus!

4. **Embrace the Power of Saying No:**
   - Yep, the “N” word. Not everything requires your attendance. Remember: it’s not personal; it’s professional.
   - Next time you get an invite for a meeting that makes your eyes glaze over, just say, ""Thanks for the invite! Is there an agenda?""

5. **Feedback Loop:**
   - After the meeting, ask yourself if the time spent was worth it. If not, refine your prioritization for next time. Learning is a cycle!

### But wait, there’s more!

Ever thought about how meetings can trigger the *caffeine crash*? ☕ You walk in ready to tackle the world, but two hours of discussion later, you're fighting the urge to take a nap. Here’s a wild idea: replace some of those meetings with **walking sessions** or **brainstorming over coffee**. 

And don't forget about **team sync-ups**. Try using a collaborative tool or group chat instead of pulling everyone into a room. It can ignite creativity without sucking the will to live out of your schedule.

So what’s your relationship with meetings? Are they helping you shine or just dimming the lights? Let’s share our hacks and help each other escape the meeting madness! 🚀✨",1,1745866239.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Mainly played fast paced competitive games such as COD, OW, MR, and occasional single player games upon release.

Why I quit: Desire to achieve things more tangible, be more present in life with others, anhedonia, mild anxiety, mild depression. I believe chronic gaming has largely contributed to my anhedonia.

Experience during first 1-5 days of quitting: It wasn't too bad, but I definitely felt small intermittent urges to play video games, only to be reminding myself that I've decided to quit. Each episodes have been reminders of how hooked I've been. I felt a little mentally flat during the initial days, but I kept myself occupied with work and chores. Energy has been ok, but could be better. I utilized meditation music while relaxing at home in the evenings. Light internet surfing, watched vlogs on Youtube. Light bodyweight workouts at home/walks around neighborhood.

Days 6-7: I've noticed that undertaking task is easier, I have a bit more energy, and I'm naturally looking to improve things in my life. I am exercising more, I detailed and got rid of small scratches on my car paint that's been there for years (Carfidant scratch and swirl remover is freaking magic btw), starting to wake up early, and strangely, coffee has been hitting me super hard in the past two days. The dose/amount hasn't changed, yet I am needing far less than I used to. Met with a friend for lunch, then walked around the shopping plaza for hours talking about our lives while trying desserts.. had a pleasant time.

1ka34tq,https://i.redd.it/8wishvq6fmxe1.png,What is your opinion on Dahlia Hawthorne?,"I just finished replaying Bridge to the Turnabout, Trials and Tribulations and the entire original Ace Attorney Trilogy and it was alot of fun. I can't decide if this case is better than Farewell My Turnaboit, I think it's pretty much equal. It's probably a little bit better though.

The final trial segment is so fun to figure out what happened. At the beginning, our defendant Iris takes the witness stand and begins to admit to being an accomplice and using the snowmobile to transport the corpse to Hazakura Temple but she then lies and claims she witnessed Maya Fey kill the victim Misty Fey. The most complicated part is that we prove how the body was moved from the Inner Temple side of the bridge to the Hazakura Temple side of the bridge.

Because the bridge had burnt, the real killer had to have tied the body to a rope and swung the body down like a pendulum and the body swung under the bridge and ended up on the other side for the accomplice Iris to take the body to Hazakura Temple. This means that Larry's stupid drawing was actually true. The problem is that Iris reveals she doesn't know about the pendulum trick even though she should, that's when we reveal that it's not Iris at the witness stand, the person at the witness stand is actually non other than the ghost of the late Dahlia Hawthorne being channelled by a spirit medium. It turns out that during the final investigation, Dahlia swapped places with her twin sister Iris and trapped her inside the sacred cavern. This is one of the greatest twists ever having the ghost of Dahlia in the courtroom.

Dahlia reveals her motives and what the plan was. It turns out that she met Morgan in prison before her execution and Morgan had a plan to have Pearl channel Dahlia so Dahlia could then kill Maya. Morgan just wanted Maya dead so Pearl could become the master of the Fey Clan while Dahlia, she just wanted to kill Maya because it would satisfy her, because Maya is the closest person to Mia, the lawyer who beat her in court years ago, she wanted to kill Maya just to hurt Mia as revenge, Dahlia is such a hateful spiteful cunt. We even learn that Dahlia convinced her father when she was a kid to abandon Iris for no real reason really but atleast Iris was adopted by Bikini.

Dahlia then reveals the plan failed because while Pearl tried to channel her, Misty channeled her instead but Dahlia tried to kill Maya before Misty was killed and Dahlia left her body. Dahlia tries to claim that while possessing Misty's body, Maya killed Misty in self defense and then jumped off the cliff into the river after realising she killed her own mother. But this is proven to be false, if Maya did jump off the cliff, her body would have hit the bedrocks and wouldn't be missing.

Then the ultimate twist is revealed. It turns out that the spirit medium channeling Dahlia right now is non other than Maya Fey who is still alive, after Dahlia tried to kill Maya in Misty's body, Maya escaped, asked her late sister Mia for help and Mia suggested that Maya lock herself in the sacred cavern and then channel Dahlia Hawthorne. This was so no one else could channel Dahlia and Dahlia would remained trapped inside the cavern and unable to harm anyone, until Dahlia swapped places with Iris that is. 

And then Mia makes her appearance being channelled by Pearl, she tells Dahlia that her plan had failed and that no matter what Dahlia did, she will never beat Mia. Then Phoenix and Mia let Dahlia know about all her failures and that after committing one crime after another, her plans always failed and it only lead to her getting caught. Now Dahlia said that because she's already dead, she can't be punished anymore but that is not true as her soul and ego lives on, Phoenix and Mia sentence her to an eternal suffering where she will have to remind herself that she is a pathetic woman who always lost and there is no way she can escape, this is right before the coolest breakdown scene ever as Dahlia's ghost exits Maya's body screaming before she dissappears. Dahlia is one of the best and evil antagonists in Ace Attorney and she has one of the most satisfying defeats.

But even after that, the case is still not over as we don't know who killed Misty. Someone had to have killed Misty while she was being possessed by Dahlia just to save Maya's life. There is only one man who could be the culprit, someone who wanted to save Maya because they where close to Mia, someone who couldn't make it to court during the first trial segment because they trapped on the other side of the bridge, someone who would know of Dahlia and Morgans plan beforehand and someone who couldn't see red on a white background because while cleaning up the blood from the crime scene, they failed to clean up Mayas name written in blood on the white stone lantern. The culprit is non other than Godot.

Proving that Godot is the culprit takes so long but it's so satisfying and in the end, we get to learn his backstory and motive. Godot used to be Diego Armando who was Mia's boyfriend but when interviewing Dahlia while she still hadn't been caught, she poisoned his coffee and Diego ended up in a coma. Because he was in a coma, he was unable to save Mia's life when she was murdered in Turnabout Sisters and so he blames himself but the person he blamed more was Phoenix Wright. The only reason he had go live was to keep Maya safe and when he learnt of the plan to have Maya killed, he contacted his accomplices, Iris and Misty. Misty would try to prevent Pearl from channeling Dahlia and if that failed, Misty would channel Dahlia and try to control her but failed and when Dahlia tried to kill Maya in Misty's body, Godot saved Maya buy stabbing Dahlia with the sword and unfortunately killing Misty while Iris's job would be to have the body transported somewhere else and take the blame for the murder if needed. The interesting part about Godot is that if he wanted to protect Maya, he should have trusted Phoenix and that they leave one thing up to speculation, did Godot save Maya's life because be cared about Maya or did he only stay Dahlia because he hated her so much for poisoning him and preventing him from saving Mia? He's definitely one of the most interesting characters in Ace Attorney for me.

I'm looking for a place to rent and so far, the only two places I have been contacted by have self-guided showings. I don't trust it... if it was a reputable place/company, wouldn't they have a realtor or property manager come give you a tour or have an open house?

I also have a safety concern. At the first and only showing I have been to so far, I actually showed up 30 minutes early and did the showing before my scheduled block, with no consequence and nothing preventing me from virtually going whenever I want. As a woman, I also felt really uncomfortable entering a strange building, not knowing who could be inside. I went with a friend and toured the little blue house (absolute sh\*thole btw, do not recommend) in front of Sierra Hall at UNR/a few houses away from Buzzed Coffee, and it was such an eerie, impersonal experience. Since it's self-guided, you can't ask any questions about the property and have to find your own way through an unfamiliar building with no signage pointing you to the right direction. As well as feeling threatened, I also simultaneously felt like an intruder. Very unenjoyable experience. Why does this seem to be so common? What are some other reasons this is a red flag?",6,1745865714.0,Reno,14,0.62,False
1ka349t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1ka349t/are_nictemaw_portable_washing_machines_worth_it/,Are Nictemaw Portable Washing Machines Worth It? Honest Review of the 5573_8 Washer!,"When unpacking the Nictemaw 5573_8 Washer, I was struck by its compact yet spacious design. I've had my fair share of portable washing machines, and I must admit, this one gives off a ""right tool for the job"" vibe. My laundry routine can be chaotic, especially when juggling limited space in a small apartment. This washer promises 2.8 cubic feet of space—quite a feat for something that’s not an industrial-sized beast. I also appreciated its 20-pound load capacity, which means fewer trips to the laundromat.

**Pros**

- Compact design with a surprising 20-lb capacity.
- Dual functionality: washer and spin dryer combined.
- Easy portability thanks to its side handles.

**User Experience and Design**  

I’ve tussled with awkward setups before, but the freestanding installation type suited my limited space perfectly. What surprised me most was the machine’s sleek exterior in white and grey. It’s not overly flashy but blends well with any space. I poured laundry detergent into the top-load design, and the touch-control console didn’t intimidate me—it’s straightforward. The transparent lid was a delightful addition; it lets me spy on the laundry while sipping my coffee. Seeing my clothes do their twisty dance inside was oddly therapeutic. 

Additionally, the built-in Automatic Unbalance Detection (AUD) system impressed me. I had washed a plush robe, which often causes my old machine to wobble violently, but the Nictemaw Washer adjusted itself and avoided nasty vibrations.

[Check Nictemaw 5573_8 Washer price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0dy15hrtz/)

**Control Panel and Features**  

The control panel is worth raving about. With 10 wash programs and 8 water level options, I could tailor the washing to delicate fabrics like silk or tackle heavy-duty items like jeans. The LED display and 24-hour delay function were game changers. It’s as if the washer is saying, “Fine, let’s do laundry on your schedule.” The child lock was a thoughtful touch, keeping little fingers from changing settings when I wasn't looking. It even includes a tub-clean mode, which kept the washer fresh after back-to-back loads.

**Good Aspects**

- Wide variety of settings for all fabric types.
- Child lock and tub-cleaning functionality.
- LED digital display simplifies operations.

**Performance and Noise Levels**  

Quiet doesn’t even begin to describe it. With previous washers, I always petered on annoyance whenever I heard a loud clank or whir. This machine operates so silently that I double-checked if it was on. Despite being quiet, the motor is powerful. I was amazed at how well it spun, removing 95% of water from heavy towels while still conserving energy. The spin dryer worked impressively, cutting drying time almost in half. And as promised, the vibration reduction was spot on, even on uneven floors.

**Pitfalls**

- The drain pump, while efficient, isn’t the fastest (don’t expect a gushing waterfall of water).  
- The touch controls are sensitive and can be accidentally adjusted if swiped unintentionally.  
- Water levels take some experimentation to find the sweet spot for different loads.

**Maintenance and Ease of Use**  

Maintenance is relatively stress-free. The included adapter, water inlet pipe, and instruction manual made setup smoother than I anticipated. Although it's manufactured in China, the device's quality feels like a fine chef’s knife—sturdy and built to last. The stainless steel tub’s tightly welded seams gave me confidence about durability. Nonetheless, I recommend running the tub-cleaning mode regularly, as lint can build up faster than you'd like, especially with bulkier washes. Cleaning the filter was straightforward, though I wish the tiny openings were just a tad larger for less awkward lint removal.

**Competing Brands**  

Comparing this washer to others like the BLACK+DECKER BPWM09W or COMFEE' Portable Washers, the Nictemaw version fares well in both load capacity and energy efficiency. While the BLACK+DECKER is more compact, it falls short with fewer programs. COMFEE' offers similar flexibility in water settings but is louder during high-speed spins. Where Nictemaw truly shines is in its multiple safety features and quiet operation during use.

**Bang for the Buck**  

Without revealing the exact price, I feel it hits the sweet spot in terms of affordability. You’re getting premium functionality—like diverse programs, energy-saving features, and portability—for an amount that justifies the quality. Other washers at similar pricing might lack the dual washer-spinner functionality or offer less sophisticated settings.

1ka311x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNinthHouse/comments/1ka311x/abigail_talking_about_the_river_discussion/,Abigail talking about the River [discussion],"So when Harrow finally remembers Gideon in the River after the Coffee House AU and she has her breakdown chat with Abigail, we get a decent amount of information about the River. Magnus and Abigail have a little tiff where Abigail says the souls are trapped in the River and Magnus says they are waiting for the 'second resurrection' but Abigail insists they are TRAPPED. It sounds like an old argument they've had many times and I think this is the first time I've heard of a supposed ""second resurrection."" 

Abigail explains the 4th kids have been sent onward, and they also talk a bit about what's under the River which Abigail finds terrifying. The twins are pulled back a little for one of the AU bubbles but then gone again. So are they back in the River at that point? 

With various other threads and ideas I've read in this sub I guess what Im thinking is that since the resurrection everyone who has died has been sort of stuck in the River. They aren't ""moving on"" in any sense of the word to any kind of afterlife, they are just plugged up in this waiting space, the River purgatory. 

Abigail also mentions being very worried about Silas' soul because he just went wherever he went when he jumped off (out of?) the Canon House river bubble.

According to Josh DeLeon, owner and operator at Underground Creamery, and Pudgy's owner Van Teamer, tariffs threaten to raise prices on dessert staples like chocolate, coffee, and matcha.

Known for their ""thick AF"" chocolate chip cookie, Pudgy's cookie menu relies heavily on quality chocolate. Instead of pedestrian brands like Nestle and Tollhouse, Teamer looks to culinary grade chocolate brands like Valrhona and Cacao Barry from France and Callebaut from Belgium. Imports from the European Union are subjected to a 20 percent tariff, which came into effect on April 9, [according to the BBC.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o)

According to Teamer and DeLeon, chocolate is the most expensive ingredient at both businesses. Though Underground Creamery doesn't regularly include chocolate in its beloved ice cream pints, DeLeon admitted to stocking up prior to the tariffs, buying around $7,000 worth of high-quality chocolate before the tariffs hit.

""Chocolate is scarce already,"" DeLeon said. ""It's not growing as much, same with coffee and matcha.""

1ka2y88,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka2y88/explore_if_the_bella_steam_espresso_maker/,Explore if the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker delivers café-quality brew review,"Testing the BELLA 35105-043A Steam Espresso Maker has been quite the adventure for me as someone who loves crafting a perfect cup of coffee. This compact espresso machine, marketed as a kitchen companion for creating café-quality beverages, delivers an interesting mix of strengths and quirks. Having incorporated it into my daily routine, I’ve explored every feature it offers, and there’s plenty to unpack.

**Design and Build**  
The first thing I noticed about this espresso maker was its slim, lightweight design. It’s subtle and doesn't overpower the kitchen counter. The oatmilk color finish gives it a modern, aesthetic appeal that blends well with almost any decor. It’s so compact that it fits perfectly in tiny spaces, which is great because counter real estate in my household is a luxury. However, that lightness can pose a challenge when locking or unlocking the portafilter, as the unit tends to slide around. Rubber feet for better grip would have been a game changer. Still, this portable build makes it excellent for those who want a movable espresso solution.  

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
Putting the machine to work was straightforward. Even as someone who’s owned other coffee makers, I found the lack of complex options refreshing. The BELLA Steam Espresso Maker relies on a two-option toggle: one for brewing and another for the steam wand. The instructions included with the product were clear and helpful in guiding my first brew. However, there’s a manual aspect that coffee newbies might take a moment to get accustomed to. Thankfully, the included 2-in-1 measuring scoop and tamper simplified achieving the correct coffee ground compression, ensuring smooth operation.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
After I ran a few carafes of water through for initial cleaning, I brewed my first espresso. I have to admit, my expectations weren’t sky-high—this isn’t a high-end machine—but I was pleasantly surprised. The 3.5-bar pressure system consistently produced smooth, flavorful coffee topped with a decent layer of crema. While it’s not the level of perfection you’d get from professional machines, it’s remarkably good for the price. I used Lavazza grounds, and the taste was full-bodied and satisfying, winning over even my wife, who’s notoriously picky about her coffee.

**[Check BELLA 35105-043A price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cyj7w2ss/)**  

**Milk Frothing Capabilities**  
The integrated steam wand absolutely shines. My favorite part of using this machine has been frothing milk. Whether for a cappuccino or a latte, the wand produces rich, creamy microfoam, and it’s almost shocking how well it performs. However, the placement of the steam wand is a bit low on the machine, which made it awkward to use without repositioning the unit. At one point, I had to turn the espresso maker sideways for easier access. While it’s a tad annoying, the unmatched texture of the foam made me overlook this design oversight.

**Highlights**  
- Compact design ideal for tight spaces.  
- Built-in steam wand delivers perfect microfoam every time.  
- Simple two-option control system, making it user-friendly.  
- Dishwasher-safe glass carafe and drip tray for hassle-free cleanup.  
- Durable reusable 4-cup stainless steel filter, making the process eco-friendly.  

**Flaws**  
Unfortunately, the BELLA Espresso Maker isn’t without its rough edges:  
- Lack of weight causes the machine to slide during usage.  
- Plastic exterior feels less durable, though it keeps the item lightweight.  
- Steam wand location can be inconvenient during use.  

**Competitive Options**  
In a sea of espresso makers, where does this one stand? Comparing it to the Keurig and Nespresso machines I’ve owned, this model offers better control for crafting espresso manually. However, it lacks the automation and polished espresso shots that Nespresso machines provide. Keurig single-serve machines are more convenient but functionally different—they don’t cater well to espresso enthusiasts. High-end pump espresso machines surpass the BELLA’s capabilities but come at several times the price. If you’re on a budget but still want an authentic taste of espresso, this one holds its ground solidly.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering the features packed into this compact gadget, it’s a stellar deal. More expensive machines often include bells and whistles that casual coffee drinkers might never use. In this case, you get precise espresso brewing and excellent milk frothing without unnecessary extras. Compromises on things like material quality are evident, but they’re justified at this accessible price point—perfect for someone trying out espresso brewing without making a hefty investment.

1ka2vud,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ka2vud/a_man_watched_me_outside_my_hotel_room_i_think_he/,A Man Watched Me Outside My Hotel Room. I Think He Was Trying To Get In.,"I was traveling alone for a work conference and booked a Comfort Inn near the convention center. Nothing fancy. Just clean, cheap, and close.

The lobby smelled faintly like old coffee and lemon-scented floor cleaner. The guy at the front desk barely looked up when I checked in. Just slid the keycard across the counter and muttered, ""Room 309. Elevator's to the left.""

The elevator ride up was uneventful. No one else got in with me. When the doors slid open on the third floor, I immediately noticed how quiet it was. Too quiet. No distant TVs, no doors slamming, no muffled conversations. Just a long hallway with patterned carpet and yellowish lights buzzing faintly.

My room was at the far end. 309. Past all the other identical doors.

As I rolled my suitcase down the hall, I noticed something.

At the very end of the hallway, standing near the stairwell door, there was a man. He was facing me. Not moving. Not doing anything. Just standing there, watching.

I slowed for a second, confused. Maybe he was waiting for someone. Maybe he was a guest locked out. I kept walking. Tried not to stare.

As I got closer to my door, I glanced back.

The man turned without a sound and slipped through the stairwell door. Gone.

I shook it off. Told myself it was nothing. Maybe he did not want to make it awkward. Maybe he was embarrassed.

Inside the room, everything felt a little too still. The air smelled faintly of old detergent, like the carpets had been cleaned but not aired out. I noticed the desk chair was turned to face the window. Not where housekeeping usually leaves it. A small detail, but it stuck with me.

I turned on the TV for background noise, tossed my bag onto the bed, and settled in.

The evening passed without anything else. I ordered delivery and ate on the bed, flipping through cable channels. Every now and then, I thought I heard faint footsteps in the hallway. Very soft. Not constant. Always stopping when I muted the TV to listen.

Around 1:50 AM, the room phone rang.

The sharp, old-fashioned ring cut through the quiet like a knife. I sat up, startled.

I answered.

""Hello""

Static. A faint crackling sound.

""Hello"" I said again, louder.

There was breathing on the other end. Not a voice. Just steady, audible breathing.

Then a click. Dead line.

I hung up, staring at the phone. It could have been a prank. A crossed wire. Old phone system. Hotels are not exactly known for perfect maintenance.

I laid back down, facing the door.

Maybe twenty minutes later, there was a knock.

Three slow, deliberate knocks.

Measured. Not frantic. Not playful.

I sat up and listened. Another knock.

I got up slowly, walked to the door, and looked through the peephole.

The hallway was empty.

No footsteps. No elevator ding. No stairwell door swinging shut.

I stood there longer than I should have, holding my breath, waiting.

Nothing.

I backed away and grabbed my cell. Called the front desk.

""Comfort Inn, front desk,"" the same man answered.

""Someone knocked on my door,"" I said quietly. ""And someone called my room.""

""Room number""

""309""

A pause.

""Sir, external calls cannot be connected to guest rooms,"" he said. ""Only internal.""

Another pause.

""Stay inside your room. I will send security up.""

About five minutes later, I heard the elevator ding faintly. Then slow, heavy footsteps coming down the hall.

There was a knock. Normal this time.

""Hotel security, sir""

I looked through the peephole. One staff member. Middle-aged guy. Black polo with the hotel logo. Radio on his hip.

I opened the door with the chain still latched.

He asked if I wanted him to walk the hallway and check the floor. I said yes.

He disappeared down the hallway, moving slowly. Checking doors. Looking into the stairwell. He even checked the emergency exit at the far end.

When he came back, he shook his head.

""No one out here now. Could be someone messing around,"" he said. ""Happens sometimes late at night.""

""You should keep your deadbolt locked,"" he added.

""I have,"" I said.

He gave a short nod and walked back toward the elevator. I watched until the doors closed.

I locked everything again and sat back down on the bed. I left the TV muted. I wanted to hear everything.

Around 3:00 AM, I heard it again.

The door handle moving.

Slow at first. Then a little firmer. Like someone trying to see if it was unlocked.

I got up carefully and looked through the peephole.

It was covered. Like something was pressed against it from the other side.

I backed away immediately. Heart pounding.

I grabbed the nearest chair, jammed it under the door handle, and sprinted to the room phone. I called the front desk.

""Someone is at my door,"" I hissed. ""Trying to get in.""

""Stay inside. We are sending security up right now,"" the man said.

Less than two minutes later, I heard footsteps. A knock.

""Hotel security, sir""

I checked the peephole carefully. The cover was gone. The same staff member was outside.

I opened the door with the chain still on.

""There was no one here when I got up,"" he said. ""No one in the hallway.""

I demanded they check the cameras.

He agreed and called the front desk on his radio. After a short wait, he came back.

""The feed is down,"" he said. ""Wiring issue. Cameras on this floor have been glitching. They are supposed to fix it tomorrow.""

I stared at him, not knowing what to say.

I relocked everything, reinforced the chair, and sat on the bed, wide awake.

An hour passed. Around 4:00 AM, I realized I was not going to sleep.

I decided to go downstairs to the lobby. Maybe just sit there until sunrise.

I grabbed my room key, unlocked the door, and stepped into the hallway.

It was completely silent. Still.

I started walking toward the elevators.

About halfway there, I glanced down the opposite end of the hall.

The man was there.

Head to toe in black.

Standing perfectly still.

Watching me.

I froze.

He took one step forward.

Then another.

Then he broke into a full sprint straight toward me.

Official Statement Regarding the Bel IV Incident

Star Date: 2334.192

Reference: Aether Forge Test Flight and SSNN Misinformation

To the citizens of the Settled Systems:

In light of recent misinformation circulating across public channels—most notably from SSNN’s Kyle Domelicker—the United Colonies Press Office wishes to provide a clear and accurate account of the incident at Bel IV involving Aether Forge and UC patrol vessels.

On [Star Date 2334.184], an Aether Forge test vessel, operating under a fully authorized and pre-cleared flight plan, encountered two UC Warhammer-class patrol ships during a high-speed stress evaluation.

Due to a miscommunication and failure of protocol on the part of UC patrol crews, the Aether Forge test vessel was mistakenly identified as a potential threat.

No shots were fired by Aether Forge personnel.

All damage to UC vessels was the result of friendly fire between the two UC ships involved.

Following an internal review—including black box telemetry, verified by independent third-party auditors—both UC Command and Aether Forge have reached the conclusion that the incident was an unfortunate accident caused by human error, not malicious intent.

A joint note from Aether Forge leadership reads as follows:

 ""Aether Forge remains committed to peaceful collaboration with all lawful parties within the Settled Systems. While we regret the damage sustained by UC assets, we are proud of our pilot’s professionalism and restraint under extreme circumstances. We appreciate the United Colonies' willingness to address the incident responsibly and move forward in good faith.""
​
Furthermore, the UC would like to formally address and correct certain false narratives currently being disseminated:

	•	Claims that Aether Forge 'ambushed' UC ships are categorically false.

	•	Assertions that Aether Forge is building a 'private military fleet' are unfounded conspiracy theories.

	•	Accusations against Aether Forge personnel, including Dr. Fleming, Vira Kael, and Jaxx, have no bearing on this event, nor do they reflect the reality of Aether Forge's operations.

The UC recognizes and respects a free press. However, public speculation without evidence, as promoted by Mr. Domelicker and similar outlets, undermines public trust and risks unnecessary panic.

We encourage all citizens to seek verified information through official channels.

The UC will continue working with independent organizations like Aether Forge to ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of all Settled Systems inhabitants.

Leaked Internal Memo: 

Internal Memo

United Colonies Central Command - Communications Division

Restricted - Eyes Only

Star Date: 2334.193

Subject: Official Response to SSNN ""Reporting"" on Bel IV Incident

Team,

In response to the latest ""groundbreaking investigative report"" by Kyle Domelicker (yes, that Domelicker), we've issued our formal Press Office statement, which is now available for all inquiries. If you haven’t had the pleasure of watching his broadcast yet, please know that it's everything you would expect from a man who believes ""reality"" is just a government-sponsored hologram.

Quick Summary:

The SSNN report claims that Aether Forge ""attacked"" two UC patrol ships on Bel IV. This is, of course, patently false. Domelicker, whose qualifications appear to involve watching too many old ""space espionage"" holovids and taking notes during stormy weather, has “sources” that apparently lack both credibility and basic fact-checking skills.

Observations for Internal Use (DO NOT SHARE EXTERNALLY):

	•	Kyle’s ""anonymous sources"" are almost certainly the figment of his imagination, possibly fed to him by a sentient coffee pot, judging by the sheer level of conspiracy and misinformation. His claim that Aether Forge ""opened fire"" on UC ships falls apart if you review the ship logs, which, unsurprisingly, Kyle chose to not do.

	•	Let’s also address the ""eyewitness accounts"" — one of the ""witnesses"" he interviewed was not even within 300 kilometers of the incident. We’re not sure how much more of a “firsthand” account you can get from someone in the middle of a different star system entirely.

	•	Kyle Domelicker continues his bold new career path as an unofficial conspiracy theorist who believes there’s a “shadow fleet” of rogue Aether Forge ships being run by aliens (Yes, that’s a direct quote).

	•	Quote of the Week: ""It’s well known that Aether Forge has ties to shady space pirates and secret government labs!"" — Domelicker, who has obviously watched one too many episodes of Space Conspiracy Chronicles. (We should probably recommend he look into a new hobby — perhaps knitting, or even collecting stamps. Anything to keep him grounded.)

Unofficial Observations (Again, do not publish):

	•	We should start tracking Domelicker’s ""sources"" for the inevitable Netflix special about how ""the truth is out there"" (on his personal holoscreen).

	•	Recommend forwarding him the official UC press release, but maybe with a note saying, ""Have you seen the latest episode of The X-Files? It's a real thriller!""

	•	For the love of the Settled Systems, please don’t encourage him. I’m half convinced he’s trying to start a new holovid series called ""Space Firestorm: The Aether Forge Conspiracy"" — which, given the ratings, could run for decades.

Action Items:

	•	No additional responses unless Domelicker manages to somehow convince his ""top sources"" to provide actual facts (spoiler: this won’t happen).

	•	Let him chase the ""truth"" as he always does — in circles, with a flashlight under his face for maximum effect.

	•	And absolutely no internal jokes about Aether Forge starting their own “Battlefleet.” (I know some of you had the t-shirts designed already, but let’s keep that on the down-low.)

And Finally:

Please, please, do not take any action to engage SSNN, well Kyle Domelicker, directly. A feed into his madness will just fuel his holovid empire. Let's just keep it classy and, most importantly, sane.

Signed,

Commander Leah Redding

Deputy Director, UC Communications Division

P.S. – Rumor has it Domelicker has already started a GoFundMe to investigate the ""alien tech"" he believes Aether Forge is hiding. Please don’t contribute — he definitely doesn't need any more funding for his wild theories.",2,1745865064.0,AetherForgeShips,0,1.0,False
1ka2thp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ka2thp,The Truth About Porcelain Veneers: Why They Really Do Stain,"When it comes to keeping your smile bright, not all teeth and dental treatments perform the same over time. A common belief is that porcelain veneers do not stain, but newer data shows that is not entirely true.

Natural Teeth: Fairly Stain Resistant

Natural enamel is resilient. While it can pick up some staining from coffee, tea, wine, and darker foods, good oral hygiene and regular cleanings help keep natural teeth looking bright and healthy for years.

Porcelain Veneers: They Do Stain Over Time

Although porcelain veneers are praised for their initial beauty and brightness, their stain resistance is not permanent. They are protected by a surface glaze that keeps them looking new at first. However, everyday activities like eating, brushing, and polishing can slowly wear down this glaze. 

Once that protective layer is compromised, porcelain veneers can begin to stain. This is contrary to the popular belief that they stay flawless forever. Porcelain veneers are simply a ceramic shell covered with a thin surface glaze rather than a material that is stain resistant throughout.

Enhanced Composites: Built to Resist Staining

Enhanced composite veneers offer a major advantage because they are layered and sculpted by hand rather than just coated. The material itself is designed to be stain resistant throughout, not just on the surface. Because of this, enhanced composites tend to hold their color and brightness far better over time compared to porcelain veneers. Their structure makes them one of the most color stable and long lasting options available today.

What This Means for You

Choosing the right option is not just about how your smile looks today. It is about how it will hold up years from now. Natural teeth and enhanced composites tend to resist stains better, while porcelain veneers may need more maintenance once their glaze wears down. 

If you are considering upgrading your smile, it is important to understand the differences and choose a solution that will truly last.",1,1745864969.0,porcelainveneerstruth,0,1.0,False

There's a reason why I don't use the word ""determinism"" as determinism is too loaded of a word that leads to people being misdirected with their prejudicial sentiments regarding what it could and should mean.

The case is even more so with the term ""fatalism,"" which points further towards the truth, but people's emotional predispositions override the truth perpetually.

No one pursues the truth that they claim to be pursuing. The truth is self-evident in nature, and the self-evident is that which all perpetually avoid.

All things and all beings are always acting in accordance to and within the realm of their inherent natural capacity to do so at all times. An inherent natural realm of capacity of which has an inevitable result.

>Fatalism is another matter. It's not a coherent concept. Humans are no less causal and involved in future outcomes than any other natural phenomenon.

Fatalism does not deny human integral participation in the system. That's simply a strawman that people have projected onto it due to their sentimental predispositions towards a word. Fatalism simply means that the fates of all beings are ultimately predestined.

>The future may be inevitable. I can't say for sure that it isn't.

Inevitability is simply what will be for all things and all beings. All things abide by their nature, a nature of which is given to them via infinite antecedent and circumstantial coarising factors, and allows a being to behave within a certain realm of capacity, of which has an inevitable result.

The very predicament and inherent futility of this conversation is that most everyone is looking for something ""actionable."" They are looking for a weapon or defense to wield or something ""worthwhile"" as opposed to the honest witnessed reality that includes the truth of all subjective beings and not just one or some.

They end up abiding by something completely sentimental while avoiding the truth that you claim to be pursuing.

If and when the truth is witnessed by anyone, they turn around and walk the other way. Such is the nature of the human condition, other than those who are absolutely forced to witness the truth and nothing other than it, or one who has had the infinite privilege of being liberated beyond all pretenses of any kind.

All things and all beings are always acting and  behaving in accordance to and within the realm of their natural capacity to do so at all times.

It is the case that for the extreme extreme majority, that simple biological survival and sentimentality will always supersede the pursuit and witnessing of the truth of things as they are, just as they are.

Ironically, allowing them to validate and avoid the very character that they are most likely unaware of and thus perpetuating the vehicle and being by which they identify by. All along playing it nonetheless, and acting just as they would act according to their inherent nature and realm of capacity.

Even one who witnesses the absolute will still have to play the very character that they play and abide by their natural realm of capacity to do so. The only distinction is that one no longer is more convinced of the character than the truth of the absolute.

All things are in constant flux. The blind presumption is to assume that flux can change for the better or change *freely* based on the subjective will of any individual, let alone all individuals.

>If you are thirsty and there is tea and coffee available, it might be that you will drink tea, or that you will drink coffee. Only one will occur. But which will occur is due to facts about you, as you are now, and how you choose, which is a process you perform due to your nature.

All things and all being act according to their nature and within the realm of their capacity to do so at all moments. There is no equivalent ubiqutious capacity of any kind, and freedom is not the standard for all beings.

>Maybe you will see that you can respond differently in different situations and with different perspectives offered to you.

There is no maybe for me, personally, in regards to the absolute. There is only what is. The inevitable eternal result, and only the unfolding of the fractalized freedomless trajectory that takes me there.

>True. When you are next hungry or thirsty, it may be the case that you will obtain or make yourself food or drink, or it may be the case that you will not. That's a decision you will make.

It's not just a decision you will make. You need to have the opportunity to do so. You need to have a mouth, you need to have access to food, you need to have the capacity to eat, and innumerable other factors. So, if you're assuming that all have the opportunity to do so, it is that blind projection of privilege that I speak about perpetually.",1,1745864931.0,Inherentism,0,1.0,False

Throwaway account, and names are all changed due to privacy reasons.

So I (20f) went through quite a discovery journey last year, learning about myself, and more about my past and my mom's(F52) past, and how that affected me. Long story short, my mom went through a lot of trauma as a child and young woman. This has been confirmed by my mom herself and my dad. She has C-PTSD and depression (admitted to this herself), but refuses to get treatment past taking an antidepressant. Last year she went on an overseas trip, and I was alone with my dad in the house for a while. I managed to get him to talk about when I was younger and he said that he hated the way my mom treated us, and hated how I seemed to lose the spark I had when I was younger, through my mom's actions, but that after they found the right antidepressant, she is so much better, as she doesn't snap and yell out of the blue anymore. In his mind she was basically 'fixed' now, because she was so much worse then. 

I believed him that she was so much better now than she used to be, and decided a good next step to try and repair the relationship that had been damaged by that was to talk to her with my therapist present. I set up a meeting, as well as arranging a stay at a friend's for a few nights to unwind, because I was terrified. The session when well, with a lot of crying from her end and apologizing. I thought that this was proof that she had improved. It went well for about a week before we sat down at a coffee shop and she came up with all the excuses for her behavior for example ""Daisy had it worse with her parents, I was never like that."" and ""Dad never wanted to punish you guys so I was always the bad guy"" I stood my ground and said that she did that, and it hurt me, and she finished her denying tirade with ""I tried to commit suicide because I knew I was hurting you guys. Maybe it was better if I was dead.""

After this conversation, I started to distance myself a little (hard to do when living in the same house) and relied heavily on my out of house support system. I started to notice other things, like her weird habit of buying the same clothes I buy for herself, or walking into my room without permission to borrow something without asking, and started to notice and note down comments that I used to take as truth. (For example I made a joking question of why we don't fold our shopping bags into little triangles, and she responded with ""I wanted to do it, but you guys never wanted to do it with me."" She had never even brought up folding plastic bags, and if she did, it was when I was a little kid.) It was these snide passive aggressive comments that were constant and I did not recognize them for what they were, taking them personally. If I didn't do the dishes while I was sick, she would be like ""No, its okay I understand"" and then a few days later she would randomly question out loud if I was lazy.

This wore my already declining mental health down a lot, as I became aware of more and more memories and toxic behaviors that I had ignored before. I then had a realization late last year about something (another can of worms I won't open now) and went into a depressive spiral. I came close to taking my own life, and then booked myself into a psychiatric hospital to be safe and get help. Here I got a notebook from a friend, and being encouraged to write down thoughts, I started writing in the diary. (My stay was nothing short of incredible and helpful, and I am in a much better place now). 

Cut to a month later, I am packing for university (internally extremely happy to get out of the house), and I put my diary, along with a few other books I want to take with in the spare room. The next day, I go to fetch something I needed and saw something had been moved. I brushed it off and moved on. I was eating breakfast when my mom came downstairs and I could tell she was acting weird. She came and sat by me and started conversation by saying that the dogs woke her up last night and she ended up sleeping in the spare room, but they still kept her up. After a few moments of silence she launched into ""I know you've been spreading lies about me to the church. About how I was making you ---. That's not how anything of that happened. You have to go and think about it."" I asked her how she knew about this and she said ""I'm not stupid.""

I was fighting back a panic attack at that point, so I left to go on a walk to try and calm down. I ended up calling my cousin and spending the day with her. At first I thought my brother had said something, because I had hinted about it in a conversation I had had with him earlier in the week. I called him, and he said of course not, and sounded confused. I then remembered where I had left my diary. When I got back home that night, I went to go fetch my diary and found it at the bottom of the pile of books, askew whereas the others were straight. I then asked my mother outright if she had read my diary. She responded with ""Why would I?"" I asked her where she had gotten this information from and she said she figured it out. I asked how, she said ""I'm not stupid, I can see how you've been acting distant and even from that conversation I had with you and Coral (therapist)."" I told her that was not possible, as I hadn't even thought about that then, so then where did she get this information. She then countered with ""I don't have to answer that. I don't have to sit here and be questioned.""

I said ""Okay then"" and left to my room. A few minutes later I get a knock on my door and my mother shoves a letter at me with a glare. I read the letter, and it is a 2 page 11 point letter, trying to convince me that I am wrong about everything and that she and my dad (who had no part in writing this letter) realize now that I had trauma from my chronic illness, and I am projecting it onto her because I don't know how else to deal with it. And attempting to refute things I had not talked to her about. (I don't currently have the letter as I was advised to not carry it with me, literally or metaphorically). I left it, because I was leaving for university in less than a week and I didn't know what to do.

 Later on I asked her to promise she didn't read my diary and she got upset. I asked her again to promise and all I got out of her was ""Yes."" Which is hardly a promise.

I left for university and have been here for about 2 months (in my country it starts in February). In this time, I called my dad a bunch of times for advice, and her once or twice to give an update. And then I went home for the holidays. It was fine for the first few days, but then she blew up, crying and saying that I've been cutting her off and she doesn't know what I am doing (I gave her multiple updates during this time, just not as much as I did with my dad, and he let slip some information that she didn't have and she realized from that), and that she's not even allowed to miss me (not sure what that means). I told her that a few things she said to me last year really hurt me, and I distanced myself because of that (Not 100% the truth, but its hard to explain everything to someone who is extremely upset). She asked what she said and I told her about the ""I tried to commit suicide because I knew I was hurting you guys. Maybe it was better if I was dead."" 

Her first response was ""I never said that."" I told her she very much did because its burned into my mind (I will be the first to admit emotions were high and I was crying by this point too). She then said she doesn't remember it, and she would never say something like that, so I misunderstood it. I told her that even if she didn't mean that, it really hurt me, and those were her exact words. Anyway, the next day, she apologizes for saying that, and I am excited because it seems like this is the first genuine apology. After a few moments, she turns around and tries to convince me that I am wrong about something that I had told nobody and had only written in my diary. Something that she could not have gotten from anywhere else, nor figured it out, or gotten from my brother (which was my father's theory). 

I guess I'm asking, am I the AH because I ""cut"" my mom off after she hurt me, and I tried to talk to her multiple times, or am I justified in still being civil but distancing myself from her because of her actions. What hurts the most about her reading my diary is that she set absolutely no boundaries with me, except one which was she would never, ever (her own words) read my diary. Am I crazy, or does the evidence speak for itself?",5,1745864863.0,AITAH,3,0.86,False
1ka2rdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ka2rdn/my_dog_came_back_different/,My Dog Came Back Different,"My Dog Returned After Disappearing in the Woods. He Came Back...Different.
I've been debating whether to post this for days now. Part of me thinks writing it all down might help me process what's happening, but another part is terrified that acknowledging it makes it more real. I need to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this. Please. I'm not trying to scare anyone. I genuinely need help understanding what's happening to my dog and to me.

For context, I live in a modest three-bedroom house at the edge of Millfield, backing up to Blackwood Forest. I moved here eight months ago after my relationship with Marcus ended. Five years together, engagement ring picked out, then I found the texts from his coworker. I needed somewhere quiet to rebuild myself, somewhere far from shared memories and mutual friends. Real estate was cheap here because of the ""Millfield Reputation,"" as the locals call it. Three disappearances in the past decade, all ultimately attributed to people getting lost in Blackwood's dense wilderness. The old-timers at the local coffee shop sometimes mention how the Native tribes avoided these woods long before settlers arrived. ""Bad medicine,"" they'd say with knowing glances. I never paid much attention to the folklore. I should have.

It's mostly quiet here except for the occasional hiker passing through to the trails. I've lived alone since the breakup. Just me and Cooper, my four-year-old chocolate Lab mix. The one good thing I took from that relationship.

Cooper has always been the perfect dog. Goofy, affectionate, and smart enough to know when I need space or comfort. He sleeps at the foot of my bed most nights, only moving when the heating kicks on and the floor vents become more appealing. We have our routine: morning walks through the neighborhood, evening walks along the forest edge. He's never shown aggression, never even barked at strangers without good reason.

At least, that was Cooper before.

I first noticed something strange about the forest about a month before Cooper disappeared. We were on our evening walk when I spotted unusual markings on some of the trees near the trail. Not typical trail blazes or graffiti, but intricate symbols carved deep into the bark. They resembled nothing I recognized, though something about them felt strangely familiar, like words on the tip of your tongue that you can't quite recall. Cooper refused to go near those trees, pulling hard on his leash to give them a wide berth. I didn't think much of it then. Animals have better instincts than we do.

It happened nineteen days ago. We were on our evening walk along the trail that borders the forest when a group of deer startled ahead of us. Cooper has always been curious about wildlife, but never one to chase. We'd worked on that extensively when he was a puppy. But this time was different. Something about their sudden movement triggered something in him, and before I could tighten my grip on the leash, he yanked it from my hand and bolted after them into the woods.

I called his name until my voice gave out. I searched until it was too dark to see, using my phone's flashlight to navigate the increasingly dense trees. The forest felt wrong that night. The typical ambient sounds of insects and nocturnal creatures had fallen silent, replaced by what I can only describe as a pulsing silence. A silence that felt alive, watchful. I had to give up when my battery died, promising myself I'd return at first light.

The next two weeks were hell. I put up flyers everywhere, called every shelter within fifty miles, and posted in every local Facebook group. I walked those woods every morning and every evening, expanding my search area each day. I left his favorite blanket and some food at the edge of the forest where he'd disappeared. I took time off work to search. I barely slept.

On day fifteen, Mrs. Abernathy, the elderly woman who lives two blocks over, called. She'd seen my posts and wanted to tell me she thought she'd seen Cooper near the old Wilkins property at the far edge of the woods, about four miles from where he'd disappeared.

Mrs. Abernathy has lived in Millfield her entire life. She's one of those small-town fixtures who knows everything about everyone. Her family had been here since the town's founding, and she often shared stories about Millfield's history. Not the sanitized version in the town brochures, but the dark stories passed down through generations. She was the first person who told me about the Wilkins farm when I moved here.

""The Wilkins place has a history,"" she told me over welcome cookies. ""Old man Wilkins was involved in some strange practices back in the 1920s. They say he brought books back from Europe after the Great War. Started holding meetings in that cellar of his. Then one winter, the entire family vanished. Seven people, gone without a trace. The authorities found... unusual things in that cellar. Nobody's lived there since.""

I'd dismissed it as small-town superstition then. Now her voice on the phone carried a weight that made me uneasy.

""Are you sure it was him?"" I asked, trying not to sound too desperate.

There was an odd pause before she answered. ""Well, it looked like your Cooper... mostly. But something was... off about the way he moved. Like he was being... puppeteered. Thought it was just my eyes playing tricks."" Another pause. ""You be careful if you go looking out there, Alex. Some parts of those woods, they change people. Change animals too.""

I thanked her and immediately drove to the Wilkins property. An abandoned farmhouse that local teens used for parties sometimes. The place always gave me the creeps, but I'd have walked through hell itself to find Cooper.

The property was silent when I arrived, just before sunset. The main house stood decrepit, with boarded windows and peeling paint, surrounded by overgrown fields. As I approached, calling Cooper's name, I noticed the cellar doors were ajar. Just a sliver of darkness between them.

I heard a faint whimper.

Hesitantly, I pulled the doors open. The hinges groaned in protest, and the smell hit me immediately. Damp earth, mold, and something metallic I couldn't place. Underneath it all was a sweetness, sickly and cloying, like fruit beginning to rot. I used my phone light to illuminate stone stairs descending into darkness.

""Cooper?"" I called, my voice echoing. Another whimper, definitely a dog, somewhere below.

I still can't fully explain why I went down those stairs. Anyone who's seen a horror movie would know better. But it was Cooper, I was certain of it, and he sounded hurt.

The cellar was larger than I'd expected, with several rooms branching off a main area. Water dripped somewhere, and my light caught strange markings on the walls. Symbols I didn't recognize, but which sent a chill of recognition through me. They were similar to what I'd seen carved into those trees near my house, but more elaborate, more... complete. They almost seemed to shift when viewed from the corner of my eye, as if rearranging themselves when not directly observed. There were dark stains on the concrete floor that I tried not to think about too much. The air felt thick, almost resistant, as if the darkness itself had substance.

I followed the sound of breathing to the farthest room. The temperature dropped noticeably as I approached, my breath fogging in front of me despite it being early September.

And there was Cooper, huddled in the corner, staring at me with eyes that reflected my light too brightly.

""Cooper! Oh my God!"" I rushed to him, relief overwhelming my caution.

He didn't run to me like I expected. He stayed perfectly still, watching me approach. It was only when I was a few feet away that he slowly stood up. His fur was matted with mud. No, not mud, it was too dark, too thick. And he smelled wrong, like copper and something rotten underneath the earthy scent.

But it was definitely Cooper. Same white chest patch, same notch in his ear from a fence incident last year. When I knelt and held out my hand, he finally came to me, pressing his cold nose against my palm.

I was so overwhelmed with relief that I overlooked the strangeness of finding him in that cellar, of the odd markings on the walls, of the way he kept his head tilted slightly too far to the right. I just wanted to get him home.

The vet couldn't find anything physically wrong with him the next day. She noted he was slightly underweight but otherwise healthy. No injuries, no signs of trauma. She did remark that he was ""unusually calm"" during the examination, which was unlike him. Cooper normally hated the vet.

Dr. Levine had been Cooper's vet since he was a puppy. She knew his typical behavior, which made her concerned expression all the more troubling.

""His vitals are normal, but his pupils are unusually dilated,"" she said, shining a light into Cooper's eyes. He didn't flinch or look away, just stared ahead. ""And his body temperature is lower than I'd expect. Has he been lethargic?""

""Sort of,"" I replied. ""He's been quiet. Not really himself.""

""He might be a bit traumatized from whatever happened,"" she suggested. ""Just give him time to readjust. Keep an eye on him, note any concerning behaviors. Call me immediately if anything changes."" She hesitated, then added, ""You found him in the Wilkins place, right? That old cellar?""

I nodded.

""My grandmother used to tell stories about that place,"" she said, her voice lower. ""Just... watch him closely, okay?""

If only she'd been more specific about what ""concerning behaviors"" might look like.

The first few days, I was just happy to have him back. I attributed his quietness to stress. He wasn't eating much, but the vet said that might take time. He followed me everywhere but kept a strange distance. Always watching, rarely approaching for affection like he used to.

I tried calling my friend Jenna, who'd helped me search for Cooper initially. She'd always been our go-to dog sitter and loved Cooper almost as much as I did. I thought maybe seeing a familiar face might help him readjust.

""He's acting weird,"" I told her over the phone. ""Not like himself at all. Would you mind coming over?""

""Of course,"" she said. ""I'll bring those treats he loves.""

When she arrived that afternoon, Cooper's reaction was disturbing. He backed away, growling low in his throat at the sight of her. Jenna, confused and hurt, tried to approach him slowly.

""Hey buddy, it's just me,"" she cooed, reaching out.

Cooper's growl deepened, taking on that strange layered quality I would become familiar with in the coming days. Jenna froze.

""What was that sound?"" she whispered.

""I don't know,"" I admitted. ""He's been... different since he came back.""

She stayed for only half an hour, visibly unsettled by Cooper's behavior. At the door, she pulled me aside.

""Alex, I don't want to scare you, but that doesn't seem like Cooper,"" she said. ""The way he looked at me... it wasn't him looking out from those eyes.""

""What are you saying?""

""I don't know. Just... be careful, okay? Maybe get a second opinion from another vet.""

It was on the fourth night after his return that I woke to find him standing at the foot of my bed, perfectly still, staring at me. Not lying down, but standing. His eyes caught the faint light from my alarm clock, gleaming too brightly.

""Cooper, buddy? You need to go out?"" I murmured, still half-asleep.

He didn't respond. No tail wag, no shift in posture. Just continued staring.

""Cooper?"" I sat up, fully awake now.

He turned and walked from the room, movements stiff and deliberate. I heard his nails clicking down the hallway, then silence. When I got up to check, he was sitting in the kitchen, facing the back door, motionless again.

I told myself it was nothing. Dogs are weird sometimes. Right?

The next morning, I found him in the same spot, as if he hadn't moved all night. His food bowl remained untouched.

That day, I caught him scratching at the walls, not like a normal dog might when hearing something inside, but methodically, in patterns. When I approached, he stopped immediately and walked away, that same stiff gait.

I tried to call Dr. Levine but was told she was out of town for a conference. The receptionist offered to schedule me with the other vet at the practice, but something stopped me. What would I say? My dog stands still and stares at walls? He walks funny? They'd think I was overreacting.

I should have reached out to someone then. Should have insisted on seeing another vet immediately. But a part of me was afraid of what they might find. Afraid they might want to take Cooper away from me. After spending two weeks thinking I'd lost him forever, I couldn't bear the thought of losing him again, even if this Cooper was... wrong.

A week after his return, the nighttime incidents escalated. I woke to find him not at the foot of my bed, but beside it, his face level with mine, inches away. His eyes were wide, unblinking. And his mouth... this is hard to describe without sounding crazy... his mouth was pulled back too far, exposing all his teeth in what looked like a grotesque approximation of a smile. It wasn't like a normal dog panting. The corners of his mouth were stretched backward in a way that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

I gasped and jerked backward. Cooper didn't move, didn't react to my startled response. Just kept staring, kept ""smiling.""

""Cooper, no,"" I said firmly, using my training voice. ""Go to your bed.""

After what seemed like minutes, he slowly backed away, never breaking eye contact, never closing his mouth. He retreated to the corner of the room where he stood watching me until morning.

I couldn't sleep again that night.

The next day, I noticed other things. The way he would suddenly stand alert, head cocked, listening to something I couldn't hear. The way he avoided his reflection in the hallway mirror. The way he spent hours staring at the same spot on the wall in my office, occasionally emitting a low growl that didn't sound like his voice. Too deep, almost layered, as if multiple throats were producing it.

I searched online for explanations. Could it be some rare form of rabies that the vet had missed? A neurological disorder? Poisoning from something he'd found in the forest? Nothing matched his symptoms exactly. I found a few forum posts from people whose pets had returned from being lost with behavioral changes, but nothing like what Cooper was exhibiting.

I took him back to the vet, who again found nothing physically wrong but suggested a veterinary behaviorist. The earliest appointment was two weeks out. The receptionist must have noticed my distress, because she lowered her voice and said, ""You found him at the Wilkins place, right? My cousin's hunting dog went missing there three years ago. When it came back...""

""What?"" I pressed when she trailed off.

She glanced around, then leaned closer. ""They had to put it down. It started... hurting itself. And then it tried to hurt them.""

That weekend, nine days after Cooper's return, I opened the trash can to find it empty when I knew it had been nearly full. Later that afternoon, I found Cooper in the backyard, hunched over something. When I approached, he growled. A sound that made the hair on my arms stand up. Before reluctantly moving away.

He'd been eating a dead rabbit. But not like a dog normally might. It was... arranged. Splayed out, innards exposed in what looked like a deliberate pattern. The ground around it had what appeared to be symbols scratched into the dirt, similar to what I'd seen in that cellar and on those trees.

I vomited in the bushes.

That night, I locked Cooper in the spare bedroom. I needed one night of uninterrupted sleep to think clearly. At exactly 3:17 AM (I remember checking my phone), I woke to scratching sounds. Not on the bedroom door, but on my bedroom wall. The wall shared with the spare room.

Scratch, scratch, scratch. Pause. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Rhythmic. Deliberate.

I turned on the light. The scratching stopped immediately.

Then I heard it. A sound no dog should be able to make. Words. Not barking that sounded like words, but actual formed words, in a whispered voice that was not Cooper's, not human, but something else entirely.

""Let. Me. In.""

I convinced myself I was dreaming, even as I heard the knob of the spare room door turning. I'd locked it, I was sure I'd locked it.

Morning found Cooper back in his usual spot in the kitchen, facing the back door. The spare room door was still locked. I must have dreamed it all...

Except for the deep scratch marks on the inside of my bedroom wall, exposed where a chunk of drywall had been torn away.

I should have left then. Should have gotten in my car and driven far away. But where would I go? What would happen to Cooper? And some irrational part of me still hoped this was temporary, that my real dog would return to me if I just waited it out.

I called Mrs. Abernathy, the only person who seemed to know anything about the history of this town, of the Wilkins place.

""You found him there, didn't you?"" she asked before I could explain. ""In that cellar.""

""Yes,"" I admitted. ""And now he's... not right. Something's wrong with him.""

She was silent for so long I thought we'd been disconnected.

""Mrs. Abernathy?""

""There were stories,"" she finally said, ""about what old man Wilkins was trying to do down there. Something about opening doors that should stay closed. Calling things through. Things that need... vessels.""

""Vessels?""

""Bodies,"" she clarified. ""To walk around in. My grandmother used to say the Wilkins family didn't vanish. They were... replaced.""

""That's just superstition,"" I said, but my voice lacked conviction.

""Maybe so. But you listen to me, Alex. If your dog isn't your dog anymore, you need to consider what might be wearing his skin now. And why it came home with you.""

Yesterday, things escalated further. I came home from grocery shopping to find Cooper sitting in the center of the living room, surrounded by every photograph in the house. All taken down from walls, removed from frames, and arranged in a spiral around him. In every single one, his image had been scratched out.

And last night... last night was the worst.

I pretended to sleep, keeping my eyes just slightly open, watching. Sure enough, around 2 AM, Cooper entered my room. He didn't walk normally. He moved in a jerking, almost insect-like fashion, his joints bending in ways they shouldn't. He approached the bed slowly, then climbed up with unnatural grace.

I forced myself to keep breathing evenly, fighting against every instinct to run.

He loomed over me, that terrible smile spreading across his face, wider than should be physically possible for a dog. Then he leaned down until his face was directly above mine, his breath smelling of rot and copper.

I couldn't maintain the pretense any longer. My eyes flew open fully, meeting his gaze.

""I know you're not Cooper,"" I whispered. ""What are you?""

The smile grew impossibly wider. Then, slowly, methodically, he began to peel back his lips even further, exposing not just teeth but gums, then what looked like a second set of teeth behind the first.

I scrambled backward, hitting the headboard hard. Cooper, or whatever was wearing Cooper's skin, made that layered growling sound again. Then, in that same whispered voice I'd convinced myself I had imagined:

""We. Found. You.""

I slept in my locked car last night.

This morning, Cooper acted normal. Almost too normal, like the old Cooper, waggling his tail, bringing me his leash. But his eyes... his eyes weren't right. They had always been warm brown, but now they seemed darker, with flecks of something that caught the light wrong.

I packed a bag and drove to my parents' house thirty miles away. I told them Cooper was acting strange and I needed a break. They don't allow pets in their building, so he's still at my house, with enough food and water for a couple of days. I set up a pet camera to watch him.

For the first few hours, he just sat in the kitchen, staring at the back door. Then, an hour ago, he turned and looked directly at the camera. That smile spread across his face again.

He walked to the camera, movements fluid now, nothing like a dog. His face filled the screen, eyes blinking sideways, that impossible smile widening.

""Coming. For. You.""

The feed went dead.

My phone just buzzed with a notification from my home security system. Back door open.

I don't think Cooper is alone anymore. I don't think he ever was, since he came back.

And I don't think whatever came back with him is staying in his body anymore.

If you see a chocolate Lab mix wandering around Millfield, please, please don't approach him. And if he's smiling... run.",1,1745864826.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1ka2p9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1ka2p9b/christianity_is_more_than_church_on_sundays/,Christianity is more than Church on Sundays,"I see a lot of posts here from seemingly new Christians — and even from some who have claimed Christ for a long time — but it often feels like many are missing the point. Christianity isn’t just about believing the right things or showing up on Sunday; it’s about living in a deep, growing relationship with Christ that shapes your whole life.

I’m writing this post to encourage you: don’t settle for surface-level faith. Pursue a relationship with Jesus so real, so alive, that it overflows into how you live, love, and serve others every day.

Too often, Christianity can feel like something we attend rather than something we live. But the truth is, it was never meant to be a once-a-week event — it’s a daily walk, a lifestyle, a community, and even more than that — it’s family.

We have fellowship with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3 CSB), and through that fellowship, we are called into fellowship with one another. We are not meant to live isolated, Christian lives. We are meant to live together — encouraging, serving, loving, and helping one another grow.

“And let us watch out for one another to provoke love and good works, not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day approaching.”
— Hebrews 10:24-25 (CSB)

If your walk with Christ mostly consists of sitting in a pew for an hour on Sunday, I lovingly challenge you: take a step deeper. Seek out real relationships with your church family. Text someone and ask how you can pray for them. Volunteer to mow someone’s lawn. Offer to clean the church. Invite someone to grab coffee and talk about God’s Word.

Jesus said:

“By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
— John 13:35 (CSB)

Christianity is meant to be lived with others. It’s where joy multiplies, burdens are shared, and faith is strengthened.

Don’t just warm a pew — be the hands and feet of Jesus to your brothers and sisters. It will not only bless them, but it will transform your own walk with Christ.

We are family in Christ. Let’s live like it. ",9,1745864681.0,TrueChristian,2,1.0,False

The Middle of Night

I could no longer resist—though I didn’t do much resisting anyway. I needed more coffee. The taste was  something I very much enjoyed. I started to enjoy its goodness around the time I decided to become  more public with my sharings of the One. Coffee  holds a value of sentiment. The Merchants coffee house all  those years ago had bled two things into me. An undeniable desire to share the One and be known for it, and a lust for coffee that I had long forgotten. I was sent to Philadelphia to possess George Washington, though I failed and instead possessed another man. I sat at that Merchants Coffee House, day after day prodding some into my evil schemes all the while indulging in the pleasures of earths bounty. Now Roger has brought some of that nostalgia back to me with only a sip of coffee yesterday. I must not chase all those long ago desires. For that possession turned more into a joy ride, this was a possession of mission. A possession to make me great again!

Don’t worry, Roger got a full 4 hours of sleep. He slept from 9:00 to 1:00 a.m., give or take. I rummaged  through his darkly lit trailer for some coffee. I prefer the dark, and the dim glow of the TV contrasted with the red cherry at the end of Roger’s cigarette rather nicely.

Roger had very little in his small place, so it did not take long to realize he had an old beat-up coffee  maker but no coffee. He also had a well-used baseball glove, a few cassette tapes, some canned goods,  and an old slot car he made with Gabe and his dad as a boy. They would go and race every Saturday  night they didn’t have baseball. All of this was in the kitchen cabinet. He was not using the back  bedroom, just the kitchen and the living room.  
After I understood Roger kept no coffee, I decided I needed to take a small risk. I would need to drive to  a store far enough away where nobody would know Roger. I grabbed his keys and rushed out the door.  All the snow on the ground made it brighter than I desired. I got in the car, having never driven one. I turned it on and saw the lights shining brightly right on Stata. She stared at us watchfully from across the street.  

What was that old bag doing outside in the dark at this hour? It was 20 degrees! Most mudwalkers had  too weak of a constitution to be outside in just a nightgown at this time. I peeled out of the driveway,  spitting pieces of ice and salt that bounced off Roger's trash cans as I sped right through Stata’s judgy  glare. I did not mean to leave so quickly, but I was driving for the first time and I found I somewhat liked what I accidentally did.

I wondered as I got on the main road if Stata was going to be a problem and if I needed to take care of  her. Then I remembered that she was losing her mind and anything she told Roger—or anyone—would  not be taken seriously anyway.  

Having full access to Roger's mind, I chose a place Roger had only driven past and never gone in, an  empty 24-hour gas station. I parked right in front of the door and walked in, grabbing coffee and filters.  The store was empty and every step I took felt like it was echoing. I was getting quite uneasy with the  store clerk’s eyes on me as I approached the checkout. The old man said hello. I made direct eye contact  with him and did not respond, paid, collected none of the change for the $10 I gave him, and left.  

I drove the Lesabre back rather fast with Folgers sitting next to me. I arrived home with no further sign  of Stata. If there had been, I might have done something. I was ready to be back in private with Roger's  meat suit and have a big pot of coffee as the night concluded. It was nearly time to give Roger control of  himself.

Hi All, 

A little nervous to post as I’m unfamiliar with the witchcraft community, but I have a few questions about witches and witchcraft in general. Last December, I went on multiple dates with a guy I’ve met on hinge. We clicked really well, and he even met a few people from my life. Well, in January this year, I messed up by crying over an ex-bf when we were talking about past experiences. To make matters worse, I wasn’t in a mentally great space back then and doubled down with really unreasonable behavior. My date, obviously, decided to end things, ghosted and subsequently blocked me in January. As a heap of desperation, one of my friends, who was new to witchcraft, suggested I do a spell - 2 candles (I used birthday candles - not sure if it works - pink & red if I recall) with red string tied around and to continuously say some thing along the lines of “I do not chase, I attract. *His name* will want me more than I want him.” 

Well, I messed up. Somehow, perhaps it was the universe way of telling me it’s wrong, but I said “I chase, I do not attract. *His name* will want me more than I want him.” I have no idea how many times I said that wrong phrase until it was too late. I tried to fix it and say the right term, but by then, the candles were almost gone. 

Now, I need some advise. I took some time off dating to reflect on my behaviour, been doing really well mentally and have been healing and thriving on my own. However, I cannot get him off my mind at all. I think about him essentially every day. I even dropped him a text to let him know that I was doing better, and if he wanted to get coffee some time, but he didn’t respond. 

I want to start dating, and have gone on a few dates with 2 other guys I’ve met on hinge since him, but I can’t start a relationship knowing that I still have him on my mind. 

I want to get him back, but reading lots about free will and karmic energy these few days. I realised that I shouldn’t have messed with witchcraft in the first place, but now that it’s been done, what can I do to either: 

1) Get him to reply to me & we can start dating again (ideally but I’m not hopeful)
2) Get him off my mind
3) ??? Any other alternatives ??? 

Please help 🙏
(I don’t want to do a spell to get him to love me. But is there any chance I can do something to give me another chance so we can know each other again?)",1,1745864585.0,BabyWitch,5,1.0,False

So I’ll give some context on how the date went. We are 21M and 23F and we met on bumble. We scheduled to meet 3pm, I arrive at 2:52 and she’s already there and we greet and start walking to a coffee shop she picked. On the way there she tells me that she has never been on a date before and that she’s really anxious. I tell her that I too just started dating (this is was my 7th date ever).

So we sit and order etc, and we talk and we have a lot of common interests (movies, series music etc, even politics and religion came up which I know is a no no for a first date but we agreed on everything), and at some point she pulls out her phone and she had made a long list of questions to ask to have stuff to talk about, I found that very cute and the questions were pretty fun and interesting, and in general we had really fun conversations and laughed a lot, even when there were a couple awkward pauses we just laughed.

At some point though, a friend calls her and she mutes the phone and she picked it up like 30-40 minutes later to text and told me she will be going to find some of her friends that are going to another coffee shop nearby. So after about 20 minutes we get going. 

The date was a bit over 2 hours, I’m just worried because maybe she had that as an exit strategy and she wanted to just leave, even though the vibes were good. I’m pretty inexperienced so I don’t know how to read that situation.

At the end of the date, she goes for a hug first and we say goodbye and she said it twice for some reason haha.

Then later I text her and we have the following conversation (translated from another language):

Me: I really had fun today :))

Me: Do you want to do something again this week?

(She replies 1hr later when usually she replies almost instantly)

Her: Me too, I’m just a bit sick so I don’t know when I will be able to (I did a test, it wasn’t Covid or flu)

Me: oh okay I hope you get well soon
 
Me: whenever you feel better feel free to text me to make plans if you want

Me: however if you don’t want to you can just tell me it’s alright

Her: thank you so much \^\^ I will text you when I feel a bit better 

Me: alright talk to you then

Her: alright \^~\^

-

Note: she actually did say at some point on the date that her throat was a bit sore

So I don’t know how to read the situation on if she actually wants to do a second date or if she is just making excuses because she is not interested. I just don’t want to wait a week or two to figure it out if she just ghosts me.

My friends told me to text her in a few days how she’s feeling and to recommend a date on the next weekend if she is feeling good then. However I feel like that is a bit pushy and since she hasn’t dated before it might be a bit overwhelming to ask for a date again.

Sorry for the long post, I just really clicked with her, much more than my other dates, and I love her personality and and she’s really cute, and don’t want to ruin this. I just want some advice on how to move forward and on how to read the whole situation on if she’s interested or not because it’s causing me a lot of anxiety lol.

1ka2my3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka2my3/how_does_the_bella_steam_espresso_maker_perform/,How does the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker perform in daily use review?,"The BELLA 35105-043A Steam Espresso Maker has been a genuine game-changer for my morning routine. As someone who takes coffee-making seriously (and arguably drinks too much of it), I couldn’t wait to see what this machine could do. Trust me, it’s not just your average kitchen gadget.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
This espresso maker doesn't just do its job; it looks good while doing it. Coming in a trendy oatmilk color, its compact structure ensures it doesn’t eat up my counter space. Measuring just 6.41""D x 12.51""W x 12""H, it fits seamlessly into my kitchen. I appreciate the fact that it's lightweight, but this has a downside I’ll touch on later—it does sometimes slide around. That said, its aesthetic charm makes up for a lot.

Ease of use and utilities made the initial trial a breeze. I particularly love the removable drip tray and dishwasher-safe glass carafe, which make cleanup less of a chore. Nothing bogs down my mornings more than dealing with appliances that are finicky to wash. This one hasn’t let me down in that department.

**Functionality and Brewing Power**  
This espresso maker is all about that 3.5-bar pressure. It might not be a commercial-grade powerhouse, but it delivers a near-perfect crema every single time. I tested it with some Lavazza medium roast coffee, and the results were seriously impressive. The built-in boiler heats water to just the right temperature, so bitterness and weak shots are non-issues. For someone who prefers a rich, full-bodied espresso, this hits the spot. Making up to four shots at a time? Total lifesaver on chaotic mornings when my partner and I are both vying for coffee.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact design perfect for smaller kitchens.

**The Microfoam Wand: A Hidden Gem**  
Here’s where the machine wins over latte and cappuccino lovers. The integrated steam wand is quite literally the hero of my coffee-drinking experience. Unlike standalone milk frothers I’ve tried, this one delivers creamy, velvety microfoam with minimal effort. I impressed my coworkers during a brunch by whipping up barista-style cappuccinos, and I didn’t even break a sweat! While it might not match the precision of high-end models, the wand exceeded my expectations.

Milk frothing does take some practice. One minor gripe is the positioning of the steam wand—it’s a tad low. Sometimes I have to place the machine on the edge of the counter to align things properly, but that’s a small price to pay for the quality foam it produces.

**Drawbacks**  
- Lightweight build causes some slipping while locking/unlocking the portafilter.  
- The positioning of the steam wand could be improved for easier use.  
- Plastic materials might not appeal to users looking for more durability.  

**Barista-Approved Accessories**  
The 2-in-1 measuring cup and tamper are thoughtful additions to this machine. Using those tools ensures I get consistent results every time. The reusable four-cup filter is another eco-friendly bonus—it feels satisfying to know I'm not wasting disposable filters daily. Little touches like these make me appreciate the product even more.

**Competitive Options**  
When I compared it to products like Keurig's K-Café and a Nespresso machine, this one stood out for a couple of reasons. First, it’s less expensive yet still manages to deliver strong, well-rounded espresso. Keurig might be easier to use, but the flavor doesn’t come close. The Nespresso delivers on taste but locks you into using their pods, while this BELLA appliance allows you to experiment with any coffee grounds. Machines like the Breville Bambino Plus are better in terms of build quality and features, but they’re significantly pricier. If you’re diving into espresso-making without breaking the bank, BELLA makes a compelling case.

**Price Worthiness**  
This steam espresso maker brings remarkable value for money. Sure, higher-end espresso machines are out there, each boasting fancier specs and more durable materials, but this one earns high marks for affordability and output quality. It’s not flawless, and I didn’t expect it to be given its price bracket. I should mention that its eco-friendly design and dishwasher-safe components make it a no-brainer for coffee drinkers who want convenience without guilt.

Two weeks ago my primary care provider (PA) diagnosed me as a type 2, but I'm pretty confused and seeking advice from you lovely ppl bc I know nothing about diabetes. 

When she entered the exam room she said ""I am so sorry to tell you this but you have type 2 diabetes. You blew right passed pre, and into diabetes. If you don't make some serious lifestyle changes you're gonna die young"". W out giving too many personal details, I'm 37, I work out, my diet isn't fantastic but it isn't trash either. I am not overweight. I also have crohns disease. 
She immediately put me on metformin. 

When I went to pick up the prescription my long time pharmacist raised an eyebrow and asked me what my levels were. My a1c at the time of diagnosis/blood work was 5.1 my glucose was 128. I went home and immediately shared my blood work with a friend who is a nurse, and another friend who showed their MD friend. Both said ""this is by no means type 2"". 

I was very confused. This happens to be one diagnosis that I just do not know a lot about. I have a lot of different problems having crohns so I don't consider myself illiterate when it comes to medical stuff but I am out of my depth when it comes to diabetes knowledge. 
At my follow up apt I voiced these concerns while adding that I genuinely do not know anything about diabetes. She doubled down and said these are absolutely type 2 numbers. 

I've been having severe problems at night that are preventing me from sleeping, and the metformin (I'm assuming) absolutely helped them. I also went out and bought a meter. My highest at home reading has been 109 after my morning coffee but no food. All my other readings have been under 100. 

From what I'm seeing from this sub (thank you all for sharing, I'm learning a lot) it's really making me question if I'm missing something else that could make her *so* sure that I have type 2 diabetes.

1ka2fpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1ka2fpq/explore_the_krute_carry_on_suitcase_review_is_it/,Explore the Krute Carry On Suitcase Review: Is It Worth the Hype?,"The Krute Carry On Suitcase with wheels (model B0CR129145) has been a welcome addition to my frequent travels. I wanted something lightweight, practical, and perfectly sized for airline carry-on standards, and this suitcase seemed to tick all those boxes. With a sleek hard-shell design and features like a USB charging port, TSA security lock, and smooth wheels, it was hard not to be excited to test it out and see how it held up in real-world conditions.

**Stylish and Practical Design**  
The suitcase's exterior strikes a nice balance between modern aesthetics and durability. Made from a blend of ABS and PC material, it feels lightweight yet strong enough to handle typical travel wear and tear. I love that it’s available in vibrant colors like Light Blue, which not only looks great but is easy to spot at airport baggage areas. At just over 22 inches tall, it complies with most airline carry-on limits, which is a huge relief for someone who hates waiting at baggage claim.  

Surprisingly, even though the material feels slightly pliable under pressure when empty, its performance impressed me once packed. I’ve loaded it up with heavy items and tossed it in car trunks, and it held its shape well. It’s not indestructible, though, as I’ll explain later.  

**Roomy Interior and Thoughtful Compartments**  
Despite looking compact from the outside, this carry-on offers about 40 liters of storage capacity—plenty for a long weekend or short business trip. There are functional compartments and straps inside to keep things organized. On one recent trip, I packed a mix of clothes, toiletries, and even some fragile souvenirs (hello, delicate coffee mugs), and everything made it home safely.  

Having two separate interior sections made unpacking stress-free upon arrival, especially with the zipped divider keeping items in place. However, more small dedicated pockets for smaller accessories like cables or jewelry would be a nice touch.

**Highlights**  
- Smooth and silent 360° spinner wheels for effortless maneuvering.  
- TSA-approved lock for added security.  
- Dual USB charging ports that function seamlessly with a power bank inside.  
- Stylish design available in bold colors that help it stand out.

[Check Krute Carry On Suitcase price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0cr129145/)  

**USB Charging Convenience**  
One feature that felt almost futuristic was the inclusion of USB charging ports. There’s nothing worse than your phone dying halfway through a long layover, and I was thrilled to charge on the go. All I needed was a power bank to connect inside the specially-designed pocket, and voilà—no more hunting for a power outlet in crowded airports.  

**Smooth Rolling and Handling**  
The wheels on this suitcase glide effortlessly across various surfaces. From bumpy sidewalks to smooth airport floors, pushing it around took no effort at all, even when fully loaded. I especially noticed how quiet the wheels were—they didn’t squeak or rattle, which can sometimes be an annoyance with cheaper options. The telescoping handle feels sturdy and provides multiple height adjustments for comfortable pulling or pushing.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While there are many positives, there are some critiques to address:  
- The retractable handle wobbles slightly when extended, which makes me question its long-term durability.  
- There’s no side or bottom grip, making it slightly tricky to lift into overhead compartments.   
- The middle section of the case can dent or show marks under extreme force, such as being thrown around by airline staff.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this suitcase to other carry-on options like Samsonite Omni PC or Travelpro Platinum Elite, several differences stand out. The Krute Carry On Suitcase offers comparable storage space and an unbeatable USB charging option not typically found in similarly-priced competitors. However, Samsonite excels in overall build quality and has a more rigid shell that resists deep scratches. Meanwhile, Travelpro focuses on luxurious interiors and expandable space, which the Krute model lacks.  

This product carves out a niche for travelers who prioritize functionality and affordability over premium materials or expandable capacity. Its price point and appealing features make it an excellent mid-tier option.

**Value for Money**  
At its core, the Krute suitcase balances affordability and utility well. While it may not be the cheapest thing out there, the solid construction, TSA-approved lock, and bonus features like USB ports elevate it to a sweet spot of cost-effectiveness. Is it worth the investment? If you travel a moderate amount and don’t need ultra-premium materials, absolutely. Just make sure you're treating it carefully during flights where baggage handlers might not be so gentle.

My experience testing these earbuds has been intriguing, and while I'm mostly happy with their performance, there are a few points worth mentioning for anyone considering them. Here's a detailed breakdown based on daily use, exploring both their strengths and areas where they could improve.

**Design and Comfort**  
These earbuds are impressively compact and lightweight, making them perfect for portable use. I toss them in my bag without a second thought, and they hardly take up any space thanks to the slim charging case. The included lanyard is a small but thoughtful touch, ensuring I never lose track of them. When I wore them during lengthy meetings or while jamming to my playlist during a commute, their ergonomic design kept my ears comfortable. I appreciate that they didn’t feel intrusive, unlike some bulkier earbuds that can become a nuisance after hours of use. That said, the plastic build, while durable, doesn’t quite scream “premium.” It gets the job done but might not wow those who are picky about materials.

**Battery Life and Convenience**  
Battery life is where these earbuds truly shine. I’ve clocked up to 28 hours of playback when factoring in the charging case. A single charge delivers around 9 hours, which easily covers an entire workday for me. On one occasion, I forgot to charge them overnight, but a quick 10-minute charge provided an impressive 2 hours of playback. For someone like me who often forgets to plug in devices, this fast-charging feature is a lifesaver. The convenience of automatic reconnection to the last device used also adds to the seamless experience.

[Don’t miss **Soundcore A3948** deals—check Amazon here.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0btybvr4s/)

**Performance and Customization Features**  
When it comes to sound quality, these earbuds didn’t disappoint. Using the Soundcore app, I could access 22 preset EQ settings that allowed me to tweak the audio to my liking. My favorite is the BassUp preset, which boosted the bass just enough for my podcasts and playlists to feel richer. I’m a fan of the degree of customization – from adjusting tap controls to personalizing sound profiles, there’s plenty of room for tailoring the experience. Despite its many ups, audiophiles might find the soundstage a bit narrow compared to high-end models. For most casual listeners like me, though, it’s more than enough.

**Call Clarity and AI Technology**  
Making calls with these earbuds has been a game changer. The dual microphones, combined with the AI algorithm, ensured my voice was clear even when I stepped into noisier environments like coffee shops. My coworkers never complained about background noise during virtual meetings, which was a common gripe with my older earbuds. However, there was the occasional dip in quality when transitioning between silent and noisy areas mid-call, which was a tad annoying.

**Strengths**  
- Lightweight and comfortable design for extended wear.  
- Customization options with the Soundcore app, including 22 EQ presets.  
- Fast charging and extensive playback time.  

**Negative Attributes**  
- Plastic materials feel a bit basic.  
- Sudden call quality dips during transitions between noise levels.

**Water Resistance and Durability**  
Water resistance is an often underrated feature, and these earbuds nail it with an IPX5 rating. A sweaty workout session or light rain during a walk never made me nervous about damaging them. While I wouldn’t dare take them swimming, they can handle everyday mishaps admirably. However, with a lightweight build comes a slight fear of wear and tear. Only time will tell how well they hold up against frequent use.

**Product Alternatives**  
Comparing these to similar offerings, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 and Jabra Elite 3 come to mind. The Galaxy Buds 2 outshine in aesthetics and offer a more premium feel, but their battery life doesn’t match the A20i’s endurance. Jabra Elite 3 leans on durability and ruggedness with slightly better call quality, but it lacks the extensive customization that Soundcore delivers via its app. The Soundcore earbuds feel like the perfect middle ground for users who want diverse functionality without overly straining their budget.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the solid mix of features, these earbuds are a strong contender in their price range. While not everyone will fall in love with the plastic build, the overall functionality and sound customization make this product feel like a smart investment. It strikes a great balance between affordability and premium features, appealing to a broad audience. Whether you’re an everyday user or someone who frequently makes calls on the go, these earbuds feel worth the splash.

1ka2etd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka2etd/should_you_consider_the_yabano_cm6816_espresso/,Should you consider the Yabano CM6816 espresso machine? Honest review inside!,"I’ve been daily testing the **Yabano Espresso Machine, CM6816**, over the past couple of weeks and, as a coffee enthusiast who takes caffeine breaks semi-seriously, I’ve had a chance to dig deep into its quirks and perks. A machine promising to deliver espresso, cappuccinos, and lattes with its 3.5Bar pressure is a tempting invite for coffee drinkers like myself who prefer crafting their own brews. While my experience has been satisfying overall, there were moments when I raised an eyebrow—sometimes impressed, sometimes concerned.

**Compact Design and Kitchen Fit**  
This machine arrived neatly packed, and right out of the box, it had a compact form factor that my limited counter space loved. Its dimensions (13.43""D x 10.94""W x 7.6""H) mean it doesn’t dominate the kitchen, leaving me room to actually prep other ingredients for breakfast. At just 4.66 lbs, moving it around felt like carrying a textbook. The black metallic design made it look sophisticated without shouting for attention. My friend, who has a minimalistic kitchen aesthetic, was immediately impressed when she saw it sitting cozy in my corner. The size, however, may make it a tight fit for someone needing to prepare drinks for a big family all at once.

**Ease of Use and Operation Simplicity**  
What stands out here is just how beginner-friendly it is. As someone who often wakes up groggy, the straightforward button interface became a lifesaver. Unlike complex machines that make you feel like you’re prepping for a space launch, this device gets straight to the point. Pour water, scoop in coffee grounds, lock the filter, and voila! Four cups of espresso come out quickly. My coworker—who’s never brewed a fancy drink before but was intrigued by this—managed to whip up a decent latte in under ten minutes without needing a crash course in “espresso machine wizardry.”

**Upsides**  
Here are just a few positive features that have kept this espresso machine on my radar:  
- **Beginner Friendly**: Easy for first-time users without complicated configurations.  
- **Compact Yet Functional**: Doesn’t hog counter space yet delivers solid functionality.  
- **Creamy Foam Fun**: Lets you craft cappuccinos and lattes with a creamy milk frother that works decently.  
- **Effortless Cleanup**: Removable parts like the drip tray and portafilter make cleaning painless.  
- **Affordable Entry-Level Brewing**: A gateway espresso machine for budget-conscious coffee enthusiasts.

**Frothing Experience: Mixed Feelings**  
Speaking of the steam wand, I gave it a spin to whip up some frothy cappuccino goodness. It produces creamy foam after a little bit of learning on how to position the milk container just right. On my first try, my latte foam was too dense (rookie mistake), but by day three, I could practically hear the foam cheering me on with its perfect consistency. However, I’ve read from others that frothing milk for larger drinks can be a bit of a time drain due to its power; my experience lines up with this. My cousin, who wanted extra creamy lattes, got a bit impatient waiting. She ultimately resorted to using her trusty electric frother gadget instead.

**Limitations**  
Yet, not everything about this espresso machine is roses and rainbows. Here are some downsides I noticed:  
- **Limited Pressure**: The 3.5Bar pressure is acceptable for casual home brewing but fails to deliver robust cafe-quality crema that higher-pressure machines can achieve.  
- **Build Quality Concerns**: Light plastic components make it feel less durable compared to premium, sturdy metal models.  
- **Manual Off Switch Issues**: I’ve occasionally walked away, forgetting to double-check the side-positioned “OFF” button. A more visible auto-off feature could seriously save sanity.  

**Comparing Against Other Espresso Makers**  
Over the years, I’ve dabbled with a few espresso machines like the De'Longhi Bar Pump Espresso or Breville Bambino Plus. While these models boast high-pressure functionality and better crema, they often come with hefty price tags and bulkier setups. The Yabano machine fills a unique niche as a compact, entry-level option that delivers decent results without driving you to contemplate dipping into your savings account. On the other hand, its primary rivals, such as the Mr. Coffee Steam Espresso Maker, might offer competitive pricing but lack the user-friendly design and simple milk frothing components. While it doesn’t outperform the high-end competitors, it can certainly hold its own for modest expectations.

**Price Worthiness**  
I’ve been weighing the cost of this little powerhouse not just in dollars but in coffee satisfaction. Sure, you aren’t getting Breville-level vibes or competition-worthy shots of espresso; however, you’re also saving enough to rationally enjoy other luxuries, like premium coffee beans without blowing your entire budget. This machine serves up a great value proposition for budding latte artists or anyone exploring their caffeine-love journey. The low investment, combined with ease of operation, makes the deal worthwhile even with its compromise on pressure.

1ka2eqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka2eqx/explore_the_bella_steam_espresso_maker_review_for/,Explore the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker Review for Barista-Quality Coffee at Home,"The BELLA 35105-043A Steam Espresso Maker is like having your own mini barista at home. Given its compact build and sleek oatmilk color, it easily blends into my kitchen's aesthetic without hogging counter space. I've always wanted to craft cafe-style lattes and cappuccinos, and with this product, I finally got the chance. Its 3.5-bar steam pressure creates that rich, full-bodied espresso with a golden crema on top—the kind that makes sipping coffee feel indulgent. Yet, no device comes without quirks, so let's unpack its features and my hands-on experience while testing it.

**Compact Design and Build Quality**  
The espresso maker is small enough to fit snugly on any countertop, making it perfect for apartments or smaller kitchens. It's surprisingly lightweight, which I both love and don't. On the one hand, it's easy to move around when cleaning; on the other, its lack of heft means you need to hold it steady when locking or unlocking the portafilter. Plus, since the entire exterior is made of plastic, it’s not quite as premium-feeling as some pricier models. Despite this, the oatmilk color gives it a refined, modern vibe that many people might appreciate.  

**Ease of Use**  
The first night I began using the espresso maker, I found it straightforward. I ran plain water through the glass carafe to prep it, as instructions suggested. Operating this machine is refreshingly simple: a single knob lets you toggle between brewing and steaming. There's minimal guesswork, which is fantastic for someone like me who didn’t exactly ace their coffee-making 101 class. However, I did notice that locking the portafilter sometimes causes the machine to slide slightly since the feet lack strong grip. Anti-slip mats should honestly be included but, alas, they are not.

**Positives**  
- Builds up to 3.5 bars of pressure for solid espresso shots.  
- Integrated steam wand creates creamy microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.  
- Features like the dishwasher-safe glass carafe and removable drip tray make cleaning a breeze.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Comes with helpful tools like a 2-in-1 measuring scoop and tampering tool.  
- Reusable stainless-steel filter reduces waste and brewing costs.  
- Maintains a neat, clutter-free look with its cord tie.

**Milk Frothing Performance**  
Let’s talk about frothing—the quintessential step for making cafe-level drinks, and honestly, it's where this little machine punches above its weight. The steam wand had me intimidated at first because of its low positioning, but once I figured out the angles, wow! The frothy, smooth microfoam it produces is genuinely cafe-worthy. I used oat milk and was pleasantly surprised by how well it frothed up. My wife, who loves cappuccinos, even commented on how the froth had a velvety texture she hadn’t expected from an affordable espresso maker.

On the flip side, positioning the milk pitcher under the wand requires some creativity since the wand is quite close to the base. I had to turn the machine slightly sideways to accommodate my bigger cups, which felt awkward.  

**Negatives**  
- Lightweight frame lacks stability, requiring extra care during use.  
- Milk frother being low to the base makes steaming slightly cumbersome.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Rubberized feet for a more secure setup.  
- Improvements to the steam wand's height for better ergonomics.  

**Espresso Quality**  
The coffee itself? Surprisingly good. Using Lavazza medium grounds, I got a balanced, flavorful shot of espresso that had more body than I’ve achieved with machines three times the price. While it’s not a ""true"" espresso like you’d get from professional-grade machines, it’s darn close. Still, keep in mind this is a steam machine, so don’t expect that unmistakably intense, pump-driven espresso. But for most casual coffee drinkers, this creates a very satisfying cup.

**Challengers in the Market**  
When compared to rivals like Nespresso, Keurig, or even Breville's entry-level models, the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker mainly stands out for its affordability. Machines like Nespresso are known for convenience and consistency due to their capsules but lack the hands-on engagement I personally enjoy. Breville’s compact alternatives offer more premium builds and better grind control but come with a much steeper price tag. The BELLA excels as a budget-friendly piece of equipment for beginners experimenting with lattes or cappuccinos but might feel limiting for espresso aficionados looking for customizable features.  

**Affordable Quality**  
The price-to-performance ratio of this espresso maker is honestly hard to beat. If you're the kind of person hesitant about dropping hundreds on a coffee machine just to test the espresso waters, this model is a no-brainer. With the reusable filter alone, you’re saving money compared to machines requiring proprietary pods or capsules. Add in the easy cleanup, and you’re looking at a product that offers way more than what you'd expect in this price range.
