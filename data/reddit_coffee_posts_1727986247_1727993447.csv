1fvji4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1fvji4h/fire_but_cant_stop_comparing_to_others/,FIRE but can't stop comparing to others,"As the title suggests, I'm technically FIRE'd, but early (37yo) and at this age, watching all my friends/peers start to hit career peaks in their fields, with higher titles, more money etc. I've always been a high achiever myself, but not ambitious at all professionally, and for the last 10 years have basically dreamed about just making enough of a nest egg and getting out of the rat race. To give you an idea of how non-career oriented I am: I hate LinkedIn, and just opening it and seeing all the fake postS and networking BS almost gives me nausea.

 In January, I finally decided to call it and I quit my job. This was the first time in my life I didn't have some school or new job to go immediately to, and I was elated. I had enough saved up and in the bank to last me at least 40 years, and I am confident if I wanted/needed I could transition to baristaFIRE to give myself a financial  cushion if necessary. From February through early September, I traveled, mostly abroad. Traveling is my biggest passion, and it was a great experience, though by the end I had run myself a little ragged and was excited to come back to the US to rest and assess what I wanted to do next. Btw, I don't currently own or rent, I had sold my condo in March 2023 and have been a nomad since.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next, which I know is part of the core problem, since finding purpose and identity outside of a career is a key part of dealing with retirement (etc etc). In any case, I have opened linkedin again, of nothing else because I'm bored and starting to realize that maybe I want my flavor of FIRE to be more chubby than lean (i.e., $50k vs $36k annually - I should add, I'm single no kids).  I do have other goals and hobbies that I want to pursue, such as training for triathlons, doing more SCUBA, continue traveling ofc), but a key thing that a career provides even if you don't necessarily love it, is critical thinking,  sometimes fun work, and other smart people to work with/talk to. 

Even if I go back into the workforce and work for a big company, or decide to be a freelancer, or decide to work at a coffee shop, I can't shake the comparisons with others. I'm content with my decisions, and I'm glad that I personally am not motivated for money for the sake of it like what it seems like is the majority of Americans, BUT I can admit that others' continued success and ascension up the career / salary ladder does sometimes get to me (and yes, sometimes jealous). 

Those of you who are already retired or on the way there, how do you cope with these feelings? Are you content / happy enough in your own lives, with family and friends and activities and hobbies, that you have basically made yourselves oblivious to what others are doing?

I have an old Gaggia Classic (one which lets you adjust the pressure internally) and MDF grinder.

I want to get serious about dialling in espresso. Developing a liking for cortados and espresso over lattes and cappuccinos. 

I've noticed my espresso tends to be really acidic (I prefer light to medium roasts) and if I'm using a darker roast (specialty dark roast) it tends to taste ashy. I usually get my coffee from Rave, Hasbean, Pact and Ueshima

My baseline is a 16g in 40g out since for espresso I've found I like it a bit on the lighter side texturally. 

I haven't really been timing my shots, I do drink a lot of decaf as well as caf so I'm not sure what I should be aiming for in terms of time.

EDIT: I use a wdt tool and puck screen

EDIT 2: how much coffee should I expect to go through dialling in? I've seen people easily go through 100g! Do they just toss the bad shots?

1fvj9k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1fvj9k4/the_sacred_science_of_sleep/,The Sacred Science of Sleep,"You know how we say that we don‚Äôt really know why humans need to sleep? I mean, we do to an extent, but it‚Äôs still a massive scientific work in progress. The body uses time sleeping to do a ton of wild stuff, from healing the body to compartmentalizing memories. The only thing is, that‚Äôs all we‚Äôve found so far.

Of course, the best way to study what something does, is by studying what happens in the absence of it. The longest on record is eighteen days, and by that time the cognitive function of most people isn‚Äôt too great. Granted, this was all done without using any kind of performance enhancers, so to speak.

I got the job offer weeks ago- a sleep deprivation study sponsored by the US government. Ethical? Absolutely not. But, they gave me a proposition I couldn‚Äôt refuse, to use the old cliche. 

You see, I‚Äôm genetically predisposed to a prion disease called Fatal Familial Insomnia. Right now I haven‚Äôt shown any signs of it, and on average it doesn‚Äôt start to onset until around fifty, so I have a few good years left before things go to hell for me. So, while I can, I‚Äôve dedicated myself to research into finding a cure for prion diseases, in some desperate hope that I can fix my own genetic fuck up. No luck so far, but they recruited me with the promise of access to CRISPR technology to further work on genetic modifications, and I wasn‚Äôt passing that up. Even if I can‚Äôt do it for myself in time, if it can save people down the line from the hell I saw my mother go through. The hell that awaited me whenever the fucking prion decided it was my time.

So, the basic thesis of the experiment was that we have five subjects, all people that were made to ‚Äòdisappear‚Äô by good old Uncle Sam. We weren‚Äôt given any previous information or even names, just these five people, literally assigned numbers as their names so we couldn‚Äôt figure out who they were. These people wou8ld be studied as they were deprived of sleep, using any methods possible to make sure they stayed conscious. These methods would range from drugs, rewards, torture, or anything that would prevent sleep. Again, it wasn‚Äôt ethical, but I‚Äôm doing this to hopefully save some innocent people down the line.

Myself, two other researchers, one guard to each of the subjects were given a modestly sized lab environment to work with, and amenities for non-subjects were pretty nice. We had beds, a full kitchen complete with a cook who came in for lunch/dinner, and entertainment for those of us not currently working. Good thing, because this place was our home for the foreseeable future, until this experiment was over.

The subjects had things a lot less comfortable than we did. They were kept in a common room, with individual rooms that split off from it consisting of bathrooms/showers and various entertainment options. I know, giving people so awful they were erased by the government doesn‚Äôt seem like a great thing, but we want to keep their minds stimulated to keep them awake. There would be meals brought in at regular intervals, all with the sufficient nutrition needed to thrive. Every single room was monitored by no less than three cameras, even the bathrooms, so we could constantly keep watch on every subject. In addition, there was a viewing room in front of the main common area, one way glass allowing us to directly observe.

From here on, everything is presented from my daily research notes for a full picture of how things develop. This is the personal record of Doctor Michael A Ripley, kept for my own future research and records. 

DAY ONE

Everything is going smoothly so far. I met my fellow researchers, Philip and Taryn early on and we determined how we would split work and observation. Eight hour shifts each. Taryn would take the midnight to 8 AM, I would take over until 4 PM, then Philip would finish out the night before Taryn came back to cover for him. It was easy enough, and we would have at least two guards keeping watch with us at all times in case a situation arose. 

Taryn‚Äôs shift came and went without incident. The subjects were gathered around one of the tables, folding chairs set up for seats. That was the most comfort they had, though. There were no beds, only a hard metal cot on the walls with no padding or pillow. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs about what they were accustomed to though, because nobodyw as really complaining about it.

Subject One is a male in his mid-20s. Dark hair, scrawny, pale as hell. Looked like a school shooter stereotype. 

Two is an older man, early 50s, balding and covered in some questionable tattoos. We weren‚Äôt given any info on what he did, but you don‚Äôt get that many swastikas permanently inked on by making good life decisions.

Three is in his forties. He had a kind face, wry smile that looked like he would crack a dad joke at any time. Honestly a pretty jovial guy. Probably the only one who I have no idea how he could have ended up here.

Four looked like Jeffrey Dahmer reborn in the digital age. I assume he‚Äôs in for similar acts as Dahmer, too. Hearing him talk over the monitor gave me the creeps, just monotone and uncaring. There was nothing behind his eyes.

Five looked like the American Psycho type. Wealthy, no human empathy or consideration for life, and that Tom Cruise look where every little move was rehearsed to best manipulate anyone he interacted with. I swear I saw him staring into the cameras a few times, right at me, and he would just smile.

None of them knew what the experiment was. As of now, the sleep deprivation methods weren‚Äôt in play, being so early. It wouldn‚Äôt be until near the middle of my shift that things needed a little push.

Two was yawning, and said he was going to his bunk for a nap. So, I hit the dial in his room to make sure that didn‚Äôt happen. There was no control for the lighting on their end, so I dialed up the intensity of the fluorescents. Then, I activated a small speaker hidden behind his bed, playing a frequency that would disrupt any attempt at sleep for a while. The others stayed in the commons area, bullshitting about why they were here. 

Nothing of note happened otherwise.

‚Äî‚Äî-

DAY TWO

They‚Äôre getting irritable. To be expected, considering that they‚Äôre now hitting over twenty four hours without sleep. So far the light and sound methods of deprivation have worked fine, with nobody wise to what‚Äôs happening yet. I do believe the irritability will lead to tensions by tomorrow.

Four is beginning to exhibit paranoia, frequently looking around, speaking to himself under his breath, and generally acting on edge. More than once I‚Äôve seen him staring directly into the camera, though I‚Äôm not sure if he realized it was there. Creeped me out, nonetheless.

Around noon on my shift, One began to speak to Three. I‚Äôve transcribed their conversation below.

ONE: Do you see them?

THREE: Sorry? Who? I can see all of us in here, but nothing else.

ONE: The kids.

THREE: Excuse me?

ONE: They told me what you did. 

THREE: I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.

ONE: (laughs) Sure you do. How many were there?

THREE: Please leave me alone.

ONE: You‚Äôre the reason I‚Äôm here. Why should I leave you alone?

At this point I called in one of the guards, Murray, just in case something started to go down in there. Three, despite his kinder, laid back attitude, was definitely starting to get on edge. One did leave him alone though, walking over to his own room and sitting on the metal cot, staring at the wall for the next two hours with this smile on his face like he was totally zoned out.

I‚Äôm still not sure what any of them did, so I don‚Äôt know if One was actually onto something or not. Three was certainly shaken by it though, sitting alone and not saying anything for the rest of the day. Eventually he went to his room, laying on the cot while tossing and turning. From the notes Philip left, he‚Äôs been complaining of the others being too loud, saying they‚Äôre shouting when everyone is talking in whispers at best. Likely an early sign of prolonged sleep deprivation.

Two and Four have been oddly friendly, though I‚Äôm not entirely sure why. I‚Äôve heard them briefly talk about their jobs in their early life. Two was some sort of construction contractor, while Four specialized in industrial chemicals. Of course, that‚Äôs before or during whatever got them in here. I‚Äôll keep an eye on how their relationship develops. I expect many of them to break down after a certain point. 

‚Äî-

DAY THREE

Today was relatively calm, with barely anything of note happening. The subjects have begun to isolate after over forty eight hours without sleep, each staying to their own room or corner of the main area.

I have noticed Four increasingly talking to himself, more hurried and louder than previously. Most of it was nonsense, sounding like the paranoid ramblings of some budget Alex Jones.

Subject Five is the one that‚Äôs been most interesting to watch. He‚Äôs going along with this just fine, not even a sign of irritability or paranoia. All he‚Äôs done is sit in his own corner, just watching the others. Occasionally he would give a smirk, but for the most part he just remained quiet there.

‚Äî

DAY FOUR

They‚Äôve begun to realize what‚Äôs happening. Three approached Five, asking him when the last time he slept was. Upon realizing it was before they were sent in here, they started to ask the others. One said he was awake for seventy two hours prior to arriving, suffering from insomnia as is, so I guess we had a little headstart there. Everyone else agreed they were going on day four though, referencing the clock and calender on the wall to be sure.

Two began to get irritable, screaming to be let out and told what was going on. Three tried to calm him, telling him it was likely we were being monitored. Four started to search the entire place for cameras, though he didn‚Äôt succeed. One was in his room, already deep in the throes of paranoia and whispering that ‚Äúthey were coming for him‚Äù.

From what I can gather, he‚Äôs seeing hallucinations. At one point, he was pointing at the door, screaming at something on the other side, telling it that it wasn‚Äôt welcome in his room. It sounded like he was rebuking a vampire, telling it that it didn‚Äôt have permission. At some point Two started screaming at him to shut up, the screams only getting louder as the rebuke from One turned into pleas with whatever was there to leave him alone. His cries were haunting, legitimately terrified of whatever the sleep deprivation was making him see.

During all this, Five remained in his corner, watching silently. He had by far done the least in his whole time here, but he had been awake the entire time. From my best guess, he was dissociating into a possible type of meditation, perhaps relieving some of his sleep deficiency.

‚Äî‚Äî

DAY FIVE

Our methods to date for sleep deprivation are starting to become null. Two has nodded off while Four was going into a state of microsleeps to compensate. We upped it to the next phase, introducing amphetimines through their meals. There was a very noticeable burst in altertness from everyone, though some started to display signs of what‚Äôs commonly called cabin fever.

Four began to scratch at his skin, determined that something was trying to get out of his body. Guards were on standby to assess. Before long, he had gouged long lines in his arms, blood beginning to ooze from the wounds. Murray was sent in as medical, another guard named Greg accompanying to ensure the other subjects complied.

MURRAY: Why are you injuring yourself?

FOUR: Because I need to let it out.

MURRAY: Let what out?

FOUR: My soul.

MURRAY: Your soul? Why do you need to let your soul out?

FOUR: Because it‚Äôs been trapped. It wants out before it‚Äôs stuck inside forever.

MURRAY: Alright, buddy. Let‚Äôs get you wrapped up to stop the bleeding.

TWO: Mind telling me why the hell we‚Äôre in here? I haven‚Äôt slept since stepping through that door.

MURRAY: You don‚Äôt deserve an answer.

TWO: Tell me what‚Äôs going on! (He became violent here, smashing a hand into the concrete wall).

GREG: (Draws gun) Calm the fuck down, man.

TWO: No! No! You don‚Äôt tell me what to do. I god given rights to my life!

MURRAY: You don‚Äôt have rights anymore.

After he left the room, Murray gave me the rundown of the current mood in there. The smell is terrible, according to him, and up close everyone looks ragged. Apparently the look in Four‚Äôs eyes was that of a dead man, and Murray was former special forces so I‚Äôll take his word on that. 

Philip told me that Four was still trying to claw at his skin during the night, and the guards eventually had to go in and forcibly restrain him to keep him from doing any lasting damage. Since then he‚Äôs just begged for someone to kill him so his ‚Äòsoul can leave‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know what he means by that, but the feeling of dread it‚Äôs sunk into my gut is something that scares me. There‚Äôs a foreboding here that I really don‚Äôt like.

‚Äî-

DAY SIX

I‚Äôm shaken, to put it lightly. Subject One at this point has been awake the longest of them all, at least nine days, give or take some hours. His onset of symptoms has been somewhat of a litmus test for the others, getting an idea of what could change. I fear though, that we‚Äôre only just getting into the worst of the symptoms.

We got around two in the afternoon today when One went into his room, sitting on the metal cot. Everyone else was isolating, with Two walking around and screaming every so often in anger. Three was in his room, rocking back and forth under the bed while apologizing under his breath. Four was near catatonic in his room, staring at the wall. Meanwhile, Five was just going about business. He was the only one to keep up some semblance of hygiene at this point, as the others hadn‚Äôt showered since arriving. Pretty sure I saw some of them not even cleaning up after using the toilet, so I can‚Äôt imagine the smell in the room. From what Murray told me yesterday, it made him want to gag.

I was recording amphetimine dosages, making sure we weren‚Äôt going to overdose anyone, when I heard my name. At first I assumed it was Murray, checking in to see if I wanted anything from the kitchen. When I looked around and didn‚Äôt find him though, my name was spoken again. This time from over the sound feed.

One was staring at the camera, addressing me directly as he gazed right into me through the monitor.

ONE: Why are you doing this, Michael?

I didn‚Äôt respond. I couldn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no way he could know who I am, no way that he could know my name. They didn‚Äôt even know we were here in the first place. As far as they knew, this was just a guard surveillance room behind the one way glass.

ONE: This won‚Äôt help you. You can‚Äôt be cured.

At this point I‚Äôm in the midst of an anxiety attack, full blown panic and pressing the little call button I had for the guards. Murray came shuffling in, asking if he had to go back into the ‚Äòshit pit‚Äô again as he called it now. He saw me in the midst of a meltdown, One still speaking to me directly.

ONE: You‚Äôll die screaming. You‚Äôre lucky though.

At that point Murray took me out of the room, shouting for Philip to come in and take over for a time. He sat me down in the small medical bay we had, stocked with typical EMS supplies, and gave me an anti-anxiety drug to try and get me to relax. Philip took over for the remainder of my shift and into his, so I could go on to bed and try to clear my mind. They believe me that he was talking, but were trying to give me rational reasons for what he was saying. He had been talking to himself, so maybe his name was Michael as well? Maybe it was just a hallucination of someone he knew previously? I was willing to accept any kind of rationalization at this point, but the dread was still sunk deep into my chest telling me that wasn‚Äôt the case.

I‚Äôm going to lay down now, but wanted to type out these notes while they were fresh in my mind. The medicine is making me feel drowsy.

DAY 7

I slept fitfully last night. This morning though, I found out that Philip had a similar experience as I did. One was speaking to him in the same way, under his breath and laughing. Though he wouldn‚Äôt tell me what he was saying, he was shaken to the core because One called him by name, too. We decided to sit in with Taryn during her shift this morning, just in case anything happened.

It didn‚Äôt take too long. One was still sitting in his bunk, muttering under his breath, when he mentioned Taryn by name this time. 

ONE: Do you miss it, Taryn?

Taryn didn‚Äôt know how to reply, obviously. She wasn‚Äôt quite sure what was happening, since she hadn‚Äôt had the experience Philip and I had.

ONE: Do you miss the way he touched you?

She grew pale, running from the room and barely making it into the hallway before throwing up whatever breakfast she had.

ONE: He does. He misses it!

He was laughing now, chuckling under his breath.

ONE: He‚Äôs right here, if you‚Äôd like to say hello! Daddy misses you, Taryn!

‚ÄùJesus fucking Christ‚Ä¶‚Äù was all Philip could manage to get out. I ran out after Taryn, trying to console her from the massive anxiety attack she was now having. The poor girl was crouched in a corner of the hallway, hands over her head like she was in a tornado drill, hyperventilating hard.

‚ÄùPlease make him stop.‚Äù She sobbed, begging anyone that would listen.

One of the other subjects started shouting at One as he laughed louder, pressing on their already frayed nerves. Philip shouted for me to come back as Two walked into One‚Äôs room, ready to fight. I called Murray over, getting him on standby in case things got bad.

TWO: Would you shut the FUCK UP!

He grabbed One, bashing his head into the wall like he was throwing a bloody alarm clock to shut it up. One didn‚Äôt stop laughing, despite another hit right into the wall. Murray ran in, trying to keep One from being killed as Two grabbed him again, going for another hit. One didn‚Äôt stop laughing, now looking at Two.

ONE: They found me. They‚Äôll find you soon too. You‚Äôre out of your cell.

TWO: The fuck are you even talking about you little shit?

ONE: How many girls were there?

TWO: What?

ONE: I can‚Äôt count them all. The room is getting crowded.

TWO: (smashes One‚Äôs head into the wall again) Shut up! Shut UP!

Around this time Murray ran in, another guard on duty following him to help restrain the big man. One was still laughing, now counting out loud. Honestly if it wasn‚Äôt for the caved in part of his head, it would be hilarious. He was letting out a laugh between every number like the damned Count on Sesame Street.

Murray grabbed Two, pulling him back and throwing him into his own room before shutting the door, pulling out keys to lock it so he would have solitary time to chill out. For the first time, we had to pull a patient out, bringing One into the small medical bay to assess his injuries.

By every part of science that I know of, he shouldn‚Äôt have been alive, much less conscious right then. There he was though, sitting on the medical table and laughing, muttering under his breath about all the lovely people coming out to make sure he was okay.

I got chills then, because he started saying names as he looked around the room. Our exams were showing that he was in perfect cognitive shape still, other than the lack of sleep. Hell, it looks like he was starting to come back around into a more clarified state. What better time to get some direct answers, right?

ME: One, what are you seeing right now?

ONE: The other kids. Classmates, friends, bullies‚Ä¶

ME: What kids?

ONE: The kids I buried.

My blood ran cold, wondering if he could be delusional by this point. He was ahead of the others when it came to time awake, so his symptoms were definitely going to be more advanced than the others. 

ONE: Oh, hi Coach. Mitchell! 

Suddenly, as I was exampining his pupils to see if they were still reacting to light, he began to seize on the table. Before I knew what was happening, a mass of blood and organs erupted from his stomach, seemingly being grabbed and torn from the outside.

MURRAY: Jesus! What in the hell?! Mike, did you do that?

I was backed away from the table now, blood spattered across my face and clothes. On the table, One was laughing harder now, looking around his surroundings wildly.

ONE: Ahhh, that feels so much better. 

I rushed forward, desperately trying to fit his organs back into his abdomen and keep him alive. He looked more peaceful now, in some kind of relief from before. Despite the blood gushing from his insides, he wasn‚Äôt showing any signs of trauma or stress in his psychological response. His body, at this point, should have been shutting down from shock, but he was almost refreshed, like he had just woken from a satisfying nap.

ME: One, can you still hear me?

ONE: Oh, yes. I can hear you. Sorry about that earlier.

ME: What exactly happened, One?

ONE: They want to keep me here. They‚Äôre still mad.

ME: Who‚Äôs mad, One?

ONE: I told you, the people I buried. The people I loved. I didn‚Äôt want anyone else to get them, and now they don‚Äôt want anyone else to get me.

ME: Get you? What do you mean?

ONE: The jailer.

I don‚Äôt really‚Ä¶ know what he‚Äôs talking about. After that he just laid on the table while I did what I could to stitch him up. Whatever happened, it looked like he had been pulled every which way from the inside until his guts finally burst through his skin. Some organs were shredded, with his spleen in at least three different pieces that weren‚Äôt going to do anything for him anymore. Despite all, he just stayed there, catatonic but smiling like he was finally comfortable. 

I stitched and bandaged his stomach, finally getting some of the bleeding under control. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with the shredded organs I found, just removing them so they didn‚Äôt go necrotic inside. The next thing he did is something that I, before now, would have thought was something from a horror movie.

One got up, walking right to the door with only a little bit of a limp in his gait. His skull half caved in, blood already oozing through the bandage, he walked from the medical bay, going to the door back into the subject room. As he passed by Taryn in the hallway, he briefly looked her way.

ONE: I‚Äôm sorry about earlier. He was a very angry man, very intimidating. I see how it happened so much.

TARYN: What is wrong with you! How the hell did you know that!?

ONE: He was whispering in my ear. (He looks back down the hallway to Murray and I) Can someone let me back in? I‚Äôd like to apologize to the bad man.

What else was I supposed to do? We let him in, and he went straight to Two‚Äôs door, looking through the glass at the angry man, now banging on the thick glass of his door to try and get at the scrawny boy. He stopped in shock when he got a good look at him, noticing the massive amount of blood and caved in head.

ONE: I feel bad for you. I don‚Äôt feel bad for many people, but you‚Äôre about to have a bad time.

TWO: Who the fuck are you? What do you know about me?

ONE: Everything. They told me all of it. They said they‚Äôll see you soon though, so I don‚Äôt need to do anything.

Three, Four, and Five were backed against the farthest wall they could be as One spoke. I think this was the first time I saw Five break the cool exterior, genuine fear in his face as he looked at the mangled One. The worst though was Three, who was now pale and looked like he had seen a ghost. One turned to the rest of them, now that his apology was over. His flattened skull was unnerving, even watching over a security monitor as the other three subjects looked on in horror.

One went into his room, smiling as he sat back down on his cot, going into a near catatonic state. 

Taryn was able to compose herself enough to tell us about why she had that reaction. I won‚Äôt go too into her personal trauma, but to put it short, she was molested by her father as a child. At some point in her teens, she fought back, pushing him hard enough that he fell in their bathroom, cracking his head on the toilet and dying. She was in tears as she told us this, saying she had never told anyone but the cops and her therapist about this, and there shouldn‚Äôt be any way that One would know.

We compared notes, finding out that each of us had something he shouldn‚Äôt know about. My disease, Taryn‚Äôs trauma, and Philip, who confessed he had killed two people in a drunk driving accident, one that his father managed to get him out of thanks to some money and a prosecutor friend.

Philip took over the rest of Taryn‚Äôs watch while I tried to rest in preparation for mine. It was useless though, as all I could see every time I closed my eyes was One being ripped to shreds from the inside out, smiling the whole time. He was thankful for what had happened, like they were protecting him some great evil that we didn‚Äôt know of. I needed to figure out who this Jailer he spoke of is. It‚Äôs all my mind could think about as I tossed in bed for hours, expecting Philip to call me in at any moment about some new insanity.

He didn‚Äôt, much to my surprise, and I dragged myself in to prepare for my watch, getting up to speed from him as I poured a cup of coffee in the kitchen. For the most part, things were slow compared to the usual. I don‚Äôt know if the chaos of the day already was a sign of peace for the rest, but I would take it at this point.

I observed everyone closely. One was in a near catatonic state, awake but completely checked out. I don‚Äôt know if it was because of his wounds or just the deprivation, but he was staring off into nothing, stupid smile on his face like he was daydreaming.

Five looked legitimately shaken now, peering around periodically in nervous glances. Two was still locked in his room, while Three was sitting in a corner, facing in and muttering to himself. Four, meanwhile, had taken to chewing on his fingernails, obsessively gnawing down like a dog going at a bone. Before long, he began to draw blood, chomping at fingertips and skin now. Murray went in, restraining his hands behind him to keep him from chewing on them while he wrapped them up. By the end they were basically in full casts, keeping him from doing any real damage.

Most of the remainder of my watch was uneventful, all things considered. Two was surprisingly chill by the time I finished out and Philip came back, but One was beginning to crack again. Murray and I decided it was best to isolate One for the time being, letting Two out of his confinement. Philip took over so I could rest again before I took Taryn‚Äôs shift.

I forgot to clean and descale my Jura coffee machine for a year. Today when I tried to run it it didnt manage to push out any water during start-up rinse. It then asks me to open the hot water tap - presumably to release the pressure? I am going to try to fix it myself maybe some advice on where to look?

And I gave it a good scrubbing with a brush but still is clogged. Likely a piece of limestone got loose and blocked nozzle? 

Any chance this is reversible? Im going to get descaler tomo.  


I didn't see any signs of clogging, made myself some coffee this morning it was pouring at a normal rate and crema was good. Tried again in the afternoon - clogged :(

Arrived at Cozy Campers at 9:00am via private transfer booked through Cozy Campers and picked up our camper van.¬† We had reservations at Sky Lagoon at 10:00am thinking it would help refresh us after a seven-hour flight.¬† I think it did the trick.¬† We did the seven-step ritual and enjoyed the warm water.¬† It was very crowded and busy.¬† We spent about 2 hours or so here. ¬†

We then headed to a grocery store and then hit the road toward Landmannalaugar campground where we spent our first night.¬† This was a long drive to add on to all the travel (3 hours or so) but we took out time, and enjoyed the scenery.  This route did require driving on a 4x4 road with two water crossings.  There was a spot to park/camp before the water crossings if those make you nervous.  We had a quick and simple dinner and went right to sleep at dark. Total time awake was about 36 hours or so.¬† Around 11:30pm I woke up and had to use the restroom.¬† Snow was blowing, it was dark, it was chilly.¬† The toilet was freezing. I came out of the rest room a few minutes later to clear sky and low wind and northern lights!¬† This was our first of three nights seeing them on our trip.¬†

Day 2 ‚Äì We originally planned to do a hike this day since we were waking up near trail heads in Landmannalaugar.¬† However, after a very long day and half of travel without sleep, we slept in and soaked in the natural hot spring river instead. This was an excellent choice and might have been our favorite of the hot springs we went to. A true 10/10 experience. ¬†It was the hottest water we soaked in the whole trip, and we spent about one-hour in the water with only two other people nearby.¬† We left Landmannalaugar and took our time heading to Reykholt, for reservations at Fri√∞heimar Tomato Farm. This was also an excellent experience and our first real meal since arriving in Iceland. We ordered several dishes and had a marvelous time.¬† Everything was absolutely excellent.¬† We then drove another hour to spend the night at Hvolsv√∂llur campground, had an early night.

Day 3 ‚Äì Got an early start to the day and left the campground at 7:00 for a day of the South Coast and waterfalls.¬† We hit to Seljalandsfoss first just before tour busses arrived.¬† We walked down the trail and found Gljufrabui and had it all to ourselves.¬† Walking back to the parking lot we passed lots of others heading to Gljufrabui and by the time we got back to the parking lot there were several tour busses and lots of people. We headed to Skogafoss next, and after spending some time down low, we made the trek up the stairs to enjoy the view from up high.¬† We then spent about two and a half hours hiking the Fimmvorduhals trail, which was beautiful.¬† The farther we went the more we had to all to ourselves. The weather was fair, and the wind was low.¬† Heading back toward Skogafoss and the parking lot the sun came out which made it all the better.¬† We continued on to Vik and had lunch at a brewery after a very busy morning. We took the afternoon to backtrack slightly to Reynisfjara and spent about an hour or so there walking the beach and taking photos.¬† We spent the night at the Vik campground which was by far the fullest campground we stayed at on our trip.

Day 4 ‚Äì We had a glacier tour early in the morning out of Vik with Troll Expeditions.¬† Our original itinerary had us doing a different Ice Cave Tour departing out of the J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n area, but that was canceled (we totally understood why) and Troll gave us options to reschedule out of other locations or cancel all together.  We chose to reschedule for the Katla Ice Cave Tour leaving from Vik. Our Tour departed at 7:30. It was short, sweet, very good scenery, our guide was fun, and we were back in Vik by 10:30.¬† We gassed up, and hit the road for J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach where we had lunch and spent about two hours.¬† We had stop or two along the way.¬† Our destination for the night was Hofn, where we had an excellent dinner in town and camped for the night.

Day 5 ‚Äì We got an early start for a long day of driving, pulling away from the campground around 7:30am.¬† To anyone doing the drive from Hofn to Akureryi, it is totally do able, but please know this is a long day.¬† We stopped at the Viking Caf√© for coffee before hitting the road.¬† We did not go to Stokksnes because it was cloudy, and we had time constraints. We planned for a stop at Studagil Canyon which was about halfway along the drive.¬† The turn off of Road 1 is not paved for the east side parking lot.¬† Again, fine for us, but we did see two cars tipped off the side of the road.¬† It was a clear day, no poor weather.¬† Getting to the Canyon is a bit of a walk once you make it to the parking lot, more so if you must park in a different lot before the 4x4 road.¬† There were quite a lot of people here, maybe because we hit it around mid-day.¬† We spent about 1 hour here, give or take 15 minutes.¬† We made sandwiches and had lunch in the parking lot, switched drivers and continued to Akureyri.

https://preview.redd.it/nvva4zfz2msd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0628d8d08f93b218e6d8d0c6945a7094c70515db

We arrived in Akureyri around 5:00pm.¬† For our stay in Akureyri, we reserved a guest house with laundry facilities so we could reset and refresh in the middle of our road trip. We stayed in the guesthouse all three nights we were in Akureyri.  We had an early dinner walking distance from our guesthouse and then went to Forrest Lagoon and spent about 2.5 hours there.¬† This was my second favorite of the hot springs.¬† There were a good number of people here, but it did not feel as crowded as Sky Lagoon and was very enjoyable.¬† We left around closing and saw northern lights from the parking lot!

Day 6 ‚Äì Rest day.¬† Spent the day exploring around Akureyri, went to the botanic gardens, went to the Christmas Store (this was skippable to us in hindsight), did some shopping and walking around.¬† Two Cruise ships docked this day, so town was a little full, but good people watching and everyone was pleasant.¬† We had dinner and did a tasting menus at Mulaberg on the suggestion of a bartender in town.  It was very good.¬† The weather for the next day was forecasted to become increasingly stormy, so during dinner we also corresponded with North Sailing to rearrange our Whale Watching tour at their recommendation.¬† Tours out of Husavik were cancelled (our original tour) and we were rescheduled for the 10:00am tour out of √Årsk√≥gssandur instead, which was 30 minutes north of town.

Day 7 ‚Äì Morning whale watching excursion out of √Årsk√≥gssandur with North Sailing.¬† This was by far our worst weather day.¬† It was cloudy, windy, and rainy.¬† We did see some whales though, so overall a successful outing.¬† We spent the afternoon finishing up laundry and getting things in order for hitting the road the next day and having a cozy night in while it was stormy outside. We got burgers to-go from Taste which was a quick walk from out guest house and very delicious.

https://preview.redd.it/04ecj5jx2msd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c8e86566ff6460565d5c6ff2afe4afd77762e44

Day 8 ‚Äì Left Akureryi to head to Holmavik, and our ultimate destination of Drangsnes.¬† The drive was beautiful with snowcapped mountains from the storm the day before.¬† Waze took us on an unexpected detour that added an hour to our dive but we got to see a little extra of the West Fjords and had gas to spare.¬† We arrived in Holmavik around 2:30, and went to the Witchcraft Museum, which was very interesting and worth a stop if you are into that kind of thing.¬† We probably spent a little over an hour here, and then pushed on to Drangsnes.¬† The hot pots by the sea were empty, so before heading to the campground, we parked, paid (there is a credit card machine here), and soaked for about an hour or so.¬† As time passed, a few more people joined, and we left as a group was arriving.¬† Camped at Drangsnes campground.¬† We were the only ones.¬† We saw northern lights this night that they were nothing short of spectacular.¬† We saw faint lights just after sunset, and as the night went on they became stronger and stronger spreading across the while sky.¬† I believe the KP index that night was a 4, and there was not a cloud in the sky, very little wind.¬† It was amazing and we had it all to ourselves as the only campers that night.

Day 9 ‚Äì Left drive Drangsnes campground around 8:30am, gassed up in Holmavik, and headed to Dynjandi.¬† The scenery on the drive was spectacular.¬† The West Fjords seemed to be in it‚Äôs peak fall moments.¬† Spent about an hour or so at Dynjandi.¬† There is a bit of a hike if you are feeling up for it to get close to the falls.¬† Had lunch in the parking lot and then a 30 minute drive the Ferry dock.¬† I thought it would be fun to take the Ferry from the WF to Sn√¶fellsnes, but we were very early for the Ferry time and we could have driven and arrived in Stykkish√≥lmur much earlier had we not had Ferry reservations.¬† However, we were on vacation, so we stopped in Fl√≥kalundur, had some coffee and pie at the restaurant which was closing for the season in five days,  and then parked at the Ferry dock and laid down in the back of our van for an hour and a half with the heater keeping us Cozy.  In hindsight, the Ferry is rather skippable and we would not do this again.  We arrived in Stykkish√≥lmur around 8:00pm and then had an excellent dinner at Sj√°varpakkh√∫si√∞.¬† We did make a reservation a few weeks in advance.¬† Highly recommend.¬† Everything was fantastic and very reasonably priced.¬† ¬†We camped at Stykkish√≥lmur camping ground which was probably the least clean and our least favorite of the campgrounds.

Day 10 ‚Äì Got a bit of an early start, and spent the day driving  around Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula before heading back to Reykjav√≠k.¬† In hindsight, I would have liked to have spent a day Stykkish√≥lmur.¬† It seemed like a very cute fishing town.¬† Our first stop was Kirkjufell.¬† It was cloudy and the top third was obscured by clouds.¬† We spent about an hour hoping a little more of the mountain would reveal itself, but no luck.¬† We drove on to B√∫√∞akirkja (which was beautiful) and then went to Ytri Tunga.¬† Not many seals on the rocks, but we could see activity far out offshore.¬† After this stop we seemed to be ready to end our road trip and relax.¬† The Sn√¶fellsnes area seems very doable for a day trip, as the things to see and do are very close together compared to other parts of Iceland and within an hour or two of Reykjav√≠k.¬† We notified Cozy Campers we would be a few hours early returning our van.¬† We checked into our guesthouse first, moved all our personal items from the van to the guest house, filled the van with gas and swept out the dirt and returned the van.¬† This was relatively easy and quick.¬† Maybe 30 minutes or so.¬† We asked Cozy Campers to call us a taxi to take us back to our guesthouse.¬† We decompressed for a little and then went to dinner reservations at La Primavera, which was about a 20-minute walk.¬† Dinner was excellent, but no feel or taste of Iceland (it‚Äôs an Italian restaurant and we didn't necessarily expect that).¬† We made the booking based on the Down to Earth Episode on Iceland and our mouths watering as they did a little story on the restaurant.¬† Again, the food was great, but we were within much closing walking distance to a lot of other spots that were probably much less expensive and just as good of dining.¬† It seemed to be a special local spot though as there was a family birthday celebration and another special occasion dinner for what looked like some local Icelandic families.¬†

Day 11 ‚Äì Spent the day exploring Reykjav√≠k, visiting tourist shops on and near Rainbow Street. Dinner reservations at Dill.¬† Our experience was excellent.¬† We did the tasting menu with wine pairing.¬† It was about $300 USD/person which is on par with the only other Michelin star restaurant I have been to.¬† The experience, the service and the food were all outstanding. On the way home we stopped in to a restaurant our guesthouse host recommended.¬† We regretted this after.  We were riding a high from our Dill experience an wanting to try a few more things specific to Iceland before we left the next day.¬† I believe the second restaurant  was called Tapas Barinn.¬† It was very loud and crowded, and our server forgot about our table.¬† The food was good, we ordered the Icelandic lobster and puffin, but it felt overpriced both for food and drink.¬† We spent about $120 USD for one drink per person (so two drinks) and two small plates, which to me didn‚Äôt feel worth it.¬† My companion wasn‚Äôt bothered but we left because they wished to order another drink and our server never returned.  After about 10 minutes we gave up, paid and went home. 

Day 12 ‚Äì We got some coffee and pastries, got our packing in order and decided to make the 2km trek to the central bus station and take the Flybus to the airport instead of figure out a private transfer.¬† My ability to make calls wasn‚Äôt working very well and a private transfer was between $120-$150 USD.¬† The Flybus was something like $25 or $30 USD.¬† The walk felt long rolling our suitcases and carrying backpacks, but it was along the lake and over in about 25 minutes.¬† The Flybus was strait forward, and we got to the airport with lots of time to kill before our flight home.¬† We stopped at the Tax Refund window.¬† Fill this paperwork out in advance.¬† It‚Äôs very simple and makes the process at the airport much easier.¬† We had about 3 hours to kill before our flight home, so we played cards and passed the time.

Final Thoughts:

Highlights: Landmannalaugar hot springs river, Fri√∞heimar Tomato Farm, dinner at Sj√°varpakkh√∫si√∞, northern lights sightings, the town of Akureyri, my little painting by a local artist from Akureyri Art Museum gift shop, my Icelandic Blanket from the Hand Knitting Association and little wool elves for friends and family.

Cozy Campers ‚Äì this was a just fine choice.¬† The van space was a little smaller than expected.¬† We rented the Highlander III, thinking we would appreciate the extra space (it can seat and sleep three and we were two).¬† However, the extra sleep space compromised storage space and this was a challenge. We liked the moon roof and extra windows provided as it did help it feel less claustrophobic.¬† The heater worked like a champ at night and the only nights we were cold were because we were trying to figure out a good heat setting.¬† The customer service was fine.¬† I personally would have appreciated a little more handholding from Cozy, but we got along just fine with the attention we were given. While I think doing a camper and cooking most of your meals can save you money on your trip, our goal was flexibility, so this trip report isn‚Äôt about doing things as cost effectively as possible.¬† We did see lots of people with less expensive campers and even tents and eating cost effective meals from grocery stores.¬† It‚Äôs very doable to do this trip less expensively.

Weather ‚Äì we were able to pack so much in because we got unbelievably lucky with the weather.¬† Most of our time was dry and low to moderate winds and we had just as many sun days as cloudy.

Rain/Wind layer ‚Äì this is crucial. We are from Colorado, used to all four seasons and all the weather in between.¬† The ability to block the bite the wind has is the key to staying warm.¬†¬† Some days I only wore my rain pants, and light sweatshirt and rain jacket and was just fine. We both packed lots of lighter layers. ¬†The times I was chilly were little pit stops on the road where I got out without my rain/wind layer and the breeze or wind just cuts right through you.

Waterproof boots were also very valuable and necessary for waterfalls, hiking, and when it rained, and things got a little muddy.¬† You want the ability to walk through whatever is on the ground, not dance around it to save your socks. Get the proper shoes.

Layers ‚Äì look up proper layering techniques so you don‚Äôt over or under pack if this is important to you.¬† Make sure things are sweat wicking and breathable.¬† Days where I layered most I had an all season sweat wicking base layer, a midweight breathable second layer, breathable fleece layer, puffy layer, rainproof/water proof layer on my top half.¬† Bottom half Kari Traa wool base layer bottoms, water resistant hiking pants from REI, and rain pants.

Northern Lights photographing ‚Äì doing a little research before your trip goes a long way on this and this sub is a wealth of information.¬† All my photos are from my iPhone 14 Pro.¬† Lights were photographed in night mode with 3 seconds exposure.

My name's Todd. I'm an academic by nature, generally positive, optimistic, and intellectually curious. I've had a few nice connections and new friends through Reddit and it's been a much more rewarding and positive experience than dating apps so I thought I'd try again and see if I could find romance here. I'm also just in the market for expanding my circle of friends as well - who knows, maybe one of your friends is the love of my life? Physically, I'm 6', slim, in good health - oh and [here's me](https://preview.redd.it/a-more-recent-me-v0-zzwxjcgfv67d1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=9ee01407bf42d2c6ade09a15408878c737d68351). I have an office job with regular hours. Some of my interests include reading and writing (I was an English major and my favorite book is the Count of Monte Cristo for example), video and board games (I generally like rpgs), history, anime, astronomy, fan of sci-fi in general...my favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption. Lately, I've been binging some Star Trek TNG which is actually even better than I remember. I also like to run, especially on the beach at night although it's been a while since I've done that but I really do need to return to running again.

When it comes to romance, I'm definitely a hopeless romantic (just look at my major, I practically got my undergrad in Shakespeare). If you're already local, I'd love to actually go on dates even if it's something small like grabbing a cup of coffee to get to know each other. I'm generally just as comfortable going out as I am staying in. When I go out, my favorite activities are karaoke and playing pool. Huge fan of Italian food, but I also really enjoy sushi as well - I'm not too picky with restaurants simply because my mantra of 'they probably have a burger' has almost always panned out lol.

As far as values, I place a great deal of importance in: respect, affection, patience, understanding, honesty, and loyalty. Any romance that doesn't start local to South Florida is all right but I would prefer a partner willing to relocate to me if things go well (this is my preference since I own a home and am working on my PhD so I still have a school commitment for a couple of years, but I am also willing to relocate to my partner so this is negotiable). Ideally, I'm looking for a romantic partner but I'm also game to meet new friends as well! So if you're looking for someone with a few nerdy interests, a guy who likes to open doors for ladies, and is an incorrigible optimist then you should reach out, say hello (chats or pms are fine - I would rather stay on Reddit for a while), and we'll see if there's chemistry.

I had been with my (now ex) fianc√© for 3 years. He was honestly incredible. Intelligent, successful, kind, gentle, generous, helpful, considerate, handsome. He would take me on trips and bring me coffee in the morning. He would pack me lunch for work and make me dinner when I got home. He was always supportive and patient with me. My family loved him.

But last year, in August, something changed. That month he got really drunk at his birthday party, and after that it‚Äôs like a flip got switched. This man who I had never seen even slightly inebriated in the 2 years I knew him was suddenly getting drunk all the time. He would get wasted in the middle of the day alone in his apartment. I would come over to his place and he would be drunk but deny that he had been drinking. During this time, he was also much more hypersexual and vulgar at times. He was wildly effusive about his affection for me, but to the point where it all seemed kind of manic. Not like him at all. His father was an alcoholic, and I assumed that I was seeing a side of him that he had just been able to keep hidden until this time.

Finally, in January, I had enough of his drinking and the lying about his drinking and I threatened to leave him, and suddenly it stopped. No more getting drunk. No more weird hypersexuality and vulgarity. Everything went pretty much back to normal, except it actually swung a little bit in the other direction where suddenly our sex life decreased significantly over the last year.

But then, 2 days ago, I found a text message thread in his phone with his ex-girlfriend. Apparently, he had been reaching out to her intermittently for over a year, usually just little platonic things that honestly I‚Äôm not worried about, but then in September one night he started asking her for nudes and was clearly trying to meet up with her for sex. She rejected him. 

I was going to forgive him for it. Primarily because it happened during that weird 4-month period where he wasn‚Äôt acting like himself and he has since gotten sober and I have not seen evidence of any other misconduct. I reached out to her and she confirmed nothing physical ever happened between them. He states he doesn‚Äôt even remember sending the text because he was likely drunk. The texts don‚Äôt sound drunk, but he is able to text sounding sober even when he has been drinking a lot. However, I was struggling with whether I could actually forgive him for this as the only reason it didn‚Äôt become physical seems to be because she rejected him, and not because he ever limited himself.

He knows I have the password to his iPad. I confronted him about these texts 2 days ago and asked him if there was anything else I needed to know. He said no, and I figured that even if there was something he would have deleted it off his iPad by this time knowing I had the passcode and could look again. He didn‚Äôt try to change his passcode either.

But tonight I looked again and buried deep amongst hundreds of text message threads, there was one from a week after his birthday when it all started, where he had texted an escort and was setting up a meeting, I think for a ‚Äùmassage‚Äù. It does not appear that it ever ended up happening. He basically sent a photo of himself, stated this was his first time doing this so he had no references but would send his LinkedIn, and she asked him for days and times. He stated he was booking for that Thursday and then asked for her to send her link again. Then she responded, ‚ÄúDo you not know who you‚Äôre talking to?‚Äù And he responded ‚ÄúEmma, right?‚Äù And that was the last text. 

When I pointed out to him that he texted her at night and she responded in the morning, so this went on from night into the next day, he stated that during that time period he often was drunk all the time and it all kind of blended into each other. So he still claims he was drunk at that time.

It should be noted, we took vacations multiple times during these months and he had no issues with alcohol and was behaving normally. He was clearly able to chose to lose control when he was alone. 
When I said this to him, he acknowledged that it was a choice to keep getting drunk and losing control and that he kept doing it because it felt good and it took away internal pain and stress he was feeling. And because had never had this happen to him before, he had never experienced the consequences of it and wasn‚Äôt thinking about the consequences of it. 

I have no evidence of anything inappropriate before August of last year or after December of last year. It was just those 4 months.

My heart is shattered. I kicked him out tonight. When I showed him the text with the escort, he broke down sobbing. States he didn‚Äôt remember that at all. Claims he must‚Äôve been drunk. To be fair, if he had remembered doing it, I would think he would have deleted it, especially since he knew I was looking through his text messages.

He cried and stated that he was just really ‚Äúsick‚Äù during that time. He said he would go to therapy, couples counseling, AA, anything I wanted, to regain my trust and not lose me.

This man has simultaneously treated me better than anyone ever has, and also betrayed me worse than anyone ever has. 

At what point is all the good he brings to my life outweigh the way the he behaved for these few months, the lies, the betrayal? Is it worth it to give him a chance to prove that this really was just a sick time period in his life that he has learned a lesson from and he will not allow himself to repeat? 

I think my biggest fear is that shit like this was going on throughout our entire relationship and that the only reason I‚Äôm finding things from just those 4 months is because he just got sloppy due to his drunkenness. 

It sounds like the reason he reached out to his ex and the prostitute is because he wanted a little bit of a thrill and validation that comes from another woman wanting him. 
I fear that even with counseling, that basic desire for female attention and validation will not go away and with time this behavior will continue. 

It would be easier if he was not such an amazing partner in every other way. He has taken accountability and has not tried to blame me for any of this. But at what point is it not even worth trying to forgive? ",1,1727990526.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

This has been bothering me all week and I can't get my head around it. Full disclosure, yes I had been drinking at the time!

We were out for dinner and the restaurant has a magician going table to table on a Saturday night. 

He came over to our table and asked a friend to pick a number ... he chose 72. I believe he announced this out loud. 

The magician then continues his patter and eventually says to my friend ; ""do you like movies?"" - notoriously my friend has never seen any classic movies - so I blurted out something like ""he's never even seen Star Wars!!""

In my recollection, within like 1-2 seconds of me saying this, he handed over his phone with the notes app open and asked my friend to scroll to 72. It was Star Wars. Pretty amazing - but doable - I have seen similar tricks described with celebrity lists where the ""force"" comes via having 100 different notes to pull up. 

In this case even that would seem more impressive as he would've had to know I would mention Star Wars (note he never even asked me to say anything; I interrupted him to say this) and the chances that we mentioned any other film (and potentially one not even on his list) seem high.

But then to make the whole thing more impressive, he asked my friend to flip the phone over and he had a ""Star Wars"" phone case on - from what I recall there's no way he could've set both of these things up following my comment - he was already largely in the process of handing the phone over when he said ""do you like movies?""

Therefore I would deduce he must've known that Star Wars would be the outcome all along ... but I just have no idea how this is possible. My wife said maybe I saw his phone case and said it subconsciously - but this feels like a low percentage play!?

(Also extra detail if useful ...the case wasn't an ""in your face"" Star Wars branded one. I believe it was the Star Wars Coffee one seen on this link, (üîó https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1097424056/star-wars-iphone-16-15-14-plus-case) or very similar. I recall it actually being more likely a sticker on the back of his phone, covered by a see-thru phone case. Maybe this is significant - but to some extent it makes it even less likely I would've subcosciously picked it up)

What do 1,000 websites, Bitcoin ATMs, and our *awesome* Bitcoin QR Code Maker app have in common? Well, more than you think! In today‚Äôs fast-paced, tech-infused world, the intersection of these three concepts is creating a wild frontier of opportunity and ease in the realm of cryptocurrency. If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúWait, how do they even relate?‚Äù ‚Äì buckle up. This is going to be a fun ride!

Whether you're a crypto newbie, a seasoned Bitcoin user, or a web dev extraordinaire, understanding how these puzzle pieces fit together will put you on the fast track to being a crypto wizard. So, let‚Äôs dive into the realm of *1,000 websites*, *Bitcoin ATMs*, and, of course, the secret sauce: our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**.

# 1,000 Websites: The Giant Web of Possibility üåê

Let‚Äôs start with the number that gets everyone‚Äôs attention ‚Äì **1,000 websites**. Now, imagine this: 1,000 websites, each serving different purposes‚Äîblogs, eCommerce sites, news portals, you name it‚Äîintegrating cryptocurrency payments. What‚Äôs the common link that makes this all possible? QR codes, my friend. Specifically, **Bitcoin QR codes**.

From online stores selling quirky socks (because why not?) to charity donation sites, having the ability to easily receive Bitcoin payments is a *game changer*. And while building a payment system for each site sounds like a headache, here‚Äôs where QR codes save the day. Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** is like the ultimate Swiss Army knife for websites, allowing users to create unique, scannable codes that tie directly to their Bitcoin wallets. Now, any of those 1,000 sites can receive payments with just a scan!

# Why 1,000, though?

Okay, we admit it, ‚Äú1,000‚Äù just sounds cool. But the point is that as more websites embrace cryptocurrency payments, the need for fast, simple tools like Bitcoin QR codes becomes critical. And with **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**, you‚Äôve got the power to enable Bitcoin transactions across *all* your sites with ease.

Whether you‚Äôre a small business owner with a single website or a digital tycoon managing an empire of sites, you can instantly generate QR codes for Bitcoin payments, no coding experience required. Now multiply that by 1,000, and you‚Äôve got yourself a true Bitcoin web.

Oh, and did we mention it‚Äôs **FREE**? (Because who doesn‚Äôt love free stuff?)

# Bitcoin ATMs: A Digital Treasure Chest üèßüí∞

Next up, let‚Äôs talk about **Bitcoin ATMs**. These machines are like magical treasure chests scattered across the world that let you buy and sell Bitcoin with a simple tap and scan. While they may not dispense gold doubloons or shiny gems (we wish), they offer something much more practical‚ÄîBitcoin.

As of today, there are over **40,000 Bitcoin ATMs** worldwide, and that number is only growing. These ATMs make the process of buying and selling Bitcoin as simple as hitting the ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù button on your regular ATM. But here‚Äôs where it gets even more exciting‚Äîusing **Bitcoin QR codes** at these ATMs takes the ease to a whole new level.

# The Magic of QR Codes at Bitcoin ATMs ‚ú®

Here‚Äôs how it works: you walk up to a Bitcoin ATM, ready to either exchange some cash for Bitcoin or sell a portion of your digital riches. What‚Äôs the quickest way to get this done? Instead of manually typing in your Bitcoin wallet address (let‚Äôs be honest, no one wants to do that), you just whip out your QR code. Scan it, and boom‚Äîyour transaction is processed without a hitch.

But where do you get that fancy QR code, you ask? You guessed it‚Äîour **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** is the answer.

# Why Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App is a Game-Changer for Bitcoin ATMs ‚ö°

Imagine this scenario: You‚Äôre on your way to your favorite cafe, ready to grab a coffee, but realize you want to convert some cash into Bitcoin at the ATM you pass by daily. Without our QR code generator, you'd have to manually type out your wallet address on the ATM's touch screen, hoping you don‚Äôt fat-finger it and send your Bitcoin into the digital abyss.

But with the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**, you generate a scannable code in seconds, save it on your phone, and walk up to that ATM like the Bitcoin pro you are. The ATM scans your QR code, and in a blink, your Bitcoin wallet is funded. Boom. Done. Back to getting that coffee.

Our QR code generator also works the other way around. If you want to sell Bitcoin at an ATM and cash out, having your QR code ready means the transaction is faster than you can say ""blockchain."" The ATM recognizes your wallet instantly, ensuring your transaction is smooth, efficient, and totally error-free.

# A Treasure Map for Your Wallet: The Versatility of QR Codes üó∫Ô∏è

Remember how we talked about those 1,000 websites earlier? Now, combine the power of Bitcoin ATMs with the flexibility of Bitcoin QR codes, and you‚Äôve got yourself a winning combo. Whether you‚Äôre out in the real world, making a quick Bitcoin transaction at an ATM, or accepting Bitcoin payments on your website, **QR codes** make the whole process easy and fun. (Yes, we said fun‚Äîcrypto can be fun!)

Let‚Äôs face it‚ÄîQR codes are the true treasure maps of the modern digital world. No confusing wallet addresses, no chance of getting things wrong, just a clean, simple scan-and-go process.

# Why Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App is the Ultimate Treasure Chest üèÜ

Let‚Äôs break it down. Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** isn‚Äôt just another tool‚Äîit‚Äôs *the* tool you need to play the crypto game like a boss. Why?

1. **It‚Äôs Free** ‚Äì Yes, totally free! Whether you‚Äôre generating one code or a thousand, our app is available for everyone.
2. **It‚Äôs Fast and Easy** ‚Äì Generating a Bitcoin QR code takes seconds. Save it, use it, share it. It‚Äôs as simple as that.
3. **It Works Everywhere** ‚Äì Online or offline, at Bitcoin ATMs, or across websites, our QR codes are versatile. You can generate a QR code for donations, payments, or personal transactions.
4. **No More Errors** ‚Äì QR codes eliminate the risk of typing errors in long wallet addresses. No more worrying about sending your hard-earned Bitcoin into the ether.
5. **It‚Äôs Customizable** ‚Äì Want to make your QR code fancy? No problem! Add a logo, change colors, and make it your own.

# Don‚Äôt Miss Out on the Crypto Revolution üöÄ

The world of Bitcoin is growing, and so is the number of places where you can use it. From Bitcoin ATMs to eCommerce stores to charity websites, the possibilities are endless. And with our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**, you‚Äôll be ready to take advantage of every single opportunity‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre dealing with one website or 1,000.

So, next time you‚Äôre out exploring the world, scanning Bitcoin ATMs, or setting up your crypto-powered website, remember: don‚Äôt leave home without your trusty QR code. And if you haven‚Äôt already, check out our free app here: [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

Because in the wild west of crypto, QR codes are your best friend‚Äîand our app is your ticket to treasure island. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è",25,1727990297.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

So I (28F) dated a guy (43M) for I swear \*two weeks\* early in the year, and he decided it wouldn't work out because I was too young for him. There was no drama, no big break up, he even asked me to stay friends because it was rare to meet people you have a real spark with, but I needed some space after what happened. All very amicable. Anyway we really got on in terms of conversation and I figured I'd reach out last month just asking if he still wanted to be friends, no pressure: he's smart and funny and I have loads of platonic friends. He replied immediately saying yes, he hoped I was doing well, and we should have a coffee when he's in town so I can fill him in with what's been happening in town.

I said 'sure, sounds good. :)': no flirting, kisses, nothing. Anyway I didn't hear from him for about three weeks so I texted again saying ""hey just letting you know I'm away for the last week of November, but I'm otherwise free, let me know!"" (again, no flirting at all). I swear that's all I texted: not loads and loads of messages. He replied saying: ""Hi Suse, It's time to move on. I have a girlfriend. No more communication. Have a great life.""

I was stunned and really surprised because I hadn't said anything flirty or even pestered him. Did I do something wrong? What changed his mind? I don't understand the u-turn at all. I'm not distraught or anything but a bit sad about it and worried I was weird. Why do you think he did it?",2,1727990276.0,relationshipadvice,6,0.75,False

One of my greatest joys in life is food and I like having a range of things in the kitchen but literally everything good just gets eaten almost immediately. Cheese he will not put in a sandwich but just cut it straight off the block. I'll buy a block of it and only get to use it to grate on meals 3 times or less. If we have sausages or chicken basically the protein part of a meal he will cook just the packet of sausages and not combine it with anything.

We always end up with loads of pasta or potatoes and basic ingredients and everything to put with them is gone. 

Any alcohol is drunk as quickly as possibly all soft drinks or whatever. I'll buy coffee and sugar and milk but I get maybe ten coffees before it's gone. It seems futile getting annoying I enjoy, I like to save money by getting bigger packs but that just means I spend more money and hardly get any of it.

I‚Äôm a June 2024 Call, and I‚Äôm reaching out for suggestions on junior lawyer positions or referrals. I summered and articled on Bay Street in Downtown Toronto but unfortunately was not hired back due to the sluggish market.

I consider myself hardworking, socially adept, and intelligent‚Äîqualities I believe many of you share. I‚Äôm particularly interested in corporate law, focusing on areas such as private M&A, technology, and financial regulatory compliance. That said, I‚Äôm flexible regarding practice areas and am eager to find environments that offer opportunities to refine my legal skillset.

I would greatly appreciate any advice, personal stories of encouragement, or DMs with job referrals or suggestions.

Currently, I‚Äôm working with a mentor to refine my cover letter and resume, and I‚Äôm actively engaging in coffee chats. I feel confident in my application materials but am open to any feedback or additional advice you may have.

Thank you for your time, and I‚Äôd love to connect with anyone willing to share insights or opportunities!",6,1727989191.0,LawCanada,5,0.88,False

1fvi4ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1fvi4ai/help_correct_my_course/,Help correct my course.,"Hello community.
So I've got an extensive history with my weight.
I lost the first 10 lbs by cutting out sugar and carbs(water weight). Ate meat, fruits and vegg for a month before starting Carnivore(ish)
I'm 34, 5'10"", SW: 286, CW: 265, 6 weeks on Carnivore. 

Now I'm not super strict.
Here's what I do that is different than strict Carnivore:
- I season with Garlic & Herbs (couple shakes) on my chicken (salt & pepper on steak and everything else)
- I eat 1 handful (maybe 5-8) of blueberries every other day.
- I drink 8 to 12 oz of coffee daily
- Hollandaise on my eggs when I get breakfast Saturday mornings with weekly family breakfast.
- Liquid IV sugar free after exercise days (1 pack in 64 oz bottle)

Other than those things, I try to eat lean meats, 90% or higher.
I'm taking beef organs supplements for the nutrients.
I eat Fish maybe once a week usually Tuna or Salmon.
I eat ground bison, beef, ground turkey, pork (bacon) , and chicken.
Eggs, dairy (sometimes sour cream, or cheeses), and I just bought low fat cottage cheese and 2% Fage greek Yogurt.

I exercise 3 to 4 days a week. Usually jog/walk half a mile, 2 minutes on stairs and stretches to get started. Then a mix of Plyometrics, Calisthenics, and light weights for endurance. I try to walk 10,000 steps daily and get to that target 90% of the time. Minimum 8,000.

I work about 14 hours a day, I own my own business and have  a couple kids that fill the rest of my schedule. My day starts at 5:45am and I go to bed around 10 or 11pm. I usually eat my first meal around noon and my last meal before 9pm. But sometimes I'm only eating once a day doing over 1,000 calories in one meal.

All of this background to say, I'm worried that I'm not meeting my protein goals and I've lost weight before and went from 330lbs to 250lbs on Keto a couple years back. Since that loss it took me 2 years to get back up to 290lbs but I lost a bunch of muscle mass in the process. I didn't eat my desired body weight in grams of protein daily and I think that was a big contributor. I'm now facing much of the same thing. I'm loosing weight at a good pace but I'm not eating enough protein in my daily eating, I'm usually eating about 1800 cals a day, and working out about 30 to 45 mins a day 3 to 4 times a week.

Should I be counting calories, grams of protein, eating more?
Should I cut something out?
Should I consider something else?

I want to form a good healthy lifestyle and loose weight and strengthen my body in the process.

Bankruptcy? ,"I owned a little coffee shop that I was very proud of but unfortunately spent a ton of money (around $35k) to open. Some with small loans, other financed through credit cards. (6 total). The coffee shop closed as I failed to get enough business and I take responsibility for that and the situation I am in. I could not pay rent, let go of my employees and was working the store 16 hours a day, 7 days a week to try and keep it open. I simply couldn't do it anymore. 

My landlord said I could leave the lease so I did. They now are demanding rent money from 3 months ago. I cannot pay it. 

I have $3100 in debt payments a month. I have contacted each creditor and set up financial hardship plans. I am making the payments but I have no money to pay for somewhere to live, my vehicle or any personal needs. Luckily my girlfriend allowed me to move in while I try and work on things. 

I have a new 40 hour a week, $18 an hour job for a lawncare company. I'm 35, lost and feel like a loser but that's beside the point. 

I make $3000 a month and am constantly broke. I'm still behind on bills and my projection is over 5 or 6 years to even get close to paying them off if I even can. 

I have a SBA loan that I have to pay $130 a month toward as well and at this point I'm at my wits end with it all. 

Should I file bankruptcy? I have no knowledge of how it works. I was denied for multiple debt  consolidation loan. They day I'm in too much debt to get debt assistance.

I wish I could pay my debts and would like to pay what I can but the creditors won't hear that and I have run out of options. I am trying everything I know and my best and I am going deeper in the hole each month. 

Any help would be appreciated. The last year and a half has been the worst time of my life. 

Is bankruptcy right for me? Will I lose my vehicle? (I am current on it and insurance.) 
Will it even help?

1fvhxcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1fvhxcv/my_favorite_regular_is_now_my_worst_nightmare/,my favorite regular is now my worst nightmare,"I am a 24F bartender and have worked at my restaurant for over two years now. About a year ago I got promoted to become a bartender and this is when I met Alex(changed his name for privacy). 

Alex started off as the perfect customer. Super kind and respectful, low maintenance, easy to talk to, great sense of humor, and tipped really REALLY good. Like if his check was under $100 he‚Äôd always tip $50, and if it was above, he‚Äôd always tip $100. Even if he didn‚Äôt tip like this though I still would‚Äôve really enjoyed him as a customer though. I really did like talking to him and if I saw him come in I knew it‚Äôd be a good day. 

My coworker who had been bartending at my restaurant longer than I have noticed it before I did. She had suspected that Alex had a crush on me for a while, but didn‚Äôt say anything because he kept it respectful and it seemed harmless. Alex also has a wife and three children btw, and he also knows that I am engaged. So again, a harmless crush doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything especially if he doesn‚Äôt act on it. 

Or at least that‚Äôs what my coworker thought. 

Alex started coming in more and more. I would see him come in at least once a week. He then asked me what days I bartended, then he would only come in on those days. Then one of his kids got really sick and he didn‚Äôt come in for a while. Me and all the other bartenders were really worried about him during this time because his kid is super young and he all cared about this guy. 

Sometime after Thanksgiving Alex comes in again while I was working. He talks to me about his kid and he begins to tell me that he really likes talking to me and asks me again what days I work because he wants to come in when I do. He proceeds to ask me to exchange emails so he can get my schedule. I thought that was really weird and I told him emails seems a bit suspicious. He laughed it off and agreed with me then gave me his number instead. He tipped me $200 that night and I threw away his number at the end of my shift. It felt wrong and made me feel dirty. 

Maybe a week before christmas Alex comes in again and apologizes if giving me his number made me feel uncomfortable and says ‚Äúif i ever say or do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable you can tell me to fuck off.‚Äù I laugh it off and say I will, cause what am i supposed to do? I am at work and I can‚Äôt leave or do anything. I was also very confused at three time because it was very weird for him to do that. Later on when I cash him out, he starts talking about again how easy it is for him to talk to me and how he really has no one. How his mom has never cared about him and only now does because he has money. How friends have manipulated him cause of his money. I ask him ‚Äúwhat about your wife? surely she is there for you‚Äù He then continues to talk shit about his wife and how they are always fighting and can never agree. I tell him I really think he should talk to a therapist. He tells me that he‚Äôs tried and they only want his money. But then he looks at me and tells me that I am different. He also calls me attractive and continues on, I didn‚Äôt know what to say or how to even process what I was hearing but I found a way somehow to end the conversation and get back to work so he could leave. He didn‚Äôt come in for a while after that again. 

Alex came back again on Valentine‚Äôs day with his wife. I was not sure how to process it at first but he started bringing her in more and I even got talk to her and get to know her. She is wonderful and so beautiful. She is really kind, she is an elementary school teacher and she loves her family a lot. It really made me dislike Alex because here he has this wonderful wife who is struggling just as much as he is and he spends hours at my bar while she is at home taking care of her sick kid and their infant.

Anyways, things started to get better and it really seemed like their relationship was in the mend and maybe whatever was happening during the holidays was a moment of weakness for him. He started acting normal, I could talk to him without feeling uncomfortable and even when came in without his wife it was like things were back to the way they were. 

The last time I saw his wife she came in and asked if I workout and started asking me what I do cause she has fitness goals. I don‚Äôt mind normally talking about that stuff cause I enjoy weightlifting and I enjoy helping out other people that are interested in it. As I am answering her questions, Alex jumps in and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you to train her.‚Äù My jaw nearly dropped to the floor. It felt almost sinister and I started to feel trapped. I immediately say ‚Äúoh no I wouldn‚Äôt be good as a trainer.‚Äù and derail by showing his wife a woman who I know of who is a certified trainer that could help her get the results she is looking for. 

Alex started coming in alone again after that, and making very weird jokes. He started joking about me babysitting his kids. (I was literally screaming internally, I AM A STRANGER) He told me he could teach me how to paint when I mentioned I enjoy painting as a hobby. Invited me to gamble with him, when I told him I don‚Äôt like losing he told me he‚Äôd give me money to gamble. I had to make a joke about if he gave me money I wouldn‚Äôt gamble it cause then it wouldn‚Äôt be his it‚Äôd be mine. At this point I had told two of the other bartenders that are women and they had noticed it too and helped keep an eye out for me and tried to help me avoid him. But it‚Äôs very hard when I am literally trapped behind a counter. 

The worst of it happened this summer when he came in late and heard that two of my coworkers were going out for drinks after the shift. The bartender I was working with liked him a lot and the two of them have gone out for drinks before so he invited Alex to join them. Alex quickly asked me if I was joining which I said no I am tired and I am going straight to bed after my shift. He literally begs me to come out and offers to buy me a drink. I again decline, and give the excuse that I just got back from vacation and I drank way too much and need to let my body rest. Alex continues to beg me to come out with them and to let him buy me a drink 15 times that night. I am not even exaggerating. I wish it wasn‚Äôt true. The last thing he said to me before  they left for the bar was, ‚ÄúSo what will it be? yay or nay?‚Äù I tell him my answer is still no. He jokes that he didn‚Äôt hear me. I correct him and say he wasn‚Äôt listening, he then saws coyly ‚Äúwell i don‚Äôt like to listen.‚Äù I nearly flipped my shit, that pissed me off so much. but i chose to just not say anything and leave. 

Alex came back in the next week, and before he leaves he asks me to come out for a drink with him again ‚Äúas a friend.‚Äù I say i don‚Äôt drink. he says what about coffee. i say i don‚Äôt drink caffeine. he pleads with me and asks ‚Äúwater?‚Äù I finally tell him I am not comfortable going out with him at all and cash him out. He tells me to have a nice life and leaves. 

He didn‚Äôt come back in for almost three months, and I bet you can‚Äôt guess what happens next? 

Alex came in again about two weeks ago. He came in with his friend that will sometimes come in with him because he passed a really hard class. Some really high level chemical engineering class. And again things seemed to be normal. Alex is not saying anything weird just acting like nothing ever happened. I am keeping my service hat on but also trying to keep my distance as much as i can behind the counter. he also likes to sit right behind our POS computer which is also right next to the well, so again makes it really hard to avoid the man. Much to my relief nothing happens and they leave with it being a pleasant and uneventful visit. 

But now we have caught up to the present and he came in again this past Tuesday an hour before we closed by himself while I am the only bartender working. I am hoping everything will be fine and normal, but really really scared that it won‚Äôt. And to my dismay he asks me to drinks again. I avoid the question but he asks again. I tell him i‚Äôm on antibiotics so i can‚Äôt drink(which is the truth conveniently enough). But this man refuses to take a hint and continues to exhaust me, and he asks ‚Äúhow about when you‚Äôre off the antibiotics?‚Äù I tell him no again and just make an excuse that I am trying to be sober. I don‚Äôt know if he believed me or finally got the hint but he said goodnight and finally left. 

I was actually very scared with this last interaction. even though nothing serious seems to be happening from an outside perspective, i was so scared. for the first time i was actually alone behind the bar while he was here. there was one cocktailer working but there was no one behind the bar with me and he was almost the second to last customer to leave. i was very very scared of being completely alone in the whole bar just me and him. And him completely ignoring everything that happened to continue to ask me to get a drink with him is scary. it makes me so scared of what would happen if i gave him and finally agreed. what else would he continue to push? luckily my manager walked me out that night and nothing happened and for now I am safe. I finally told the bartender that went out for drinks with Alex that night. But I don‚Äôt know what else to do. from the surface he is the literal perfect customer, and i am just so lucky that the people i‚Äôve told believe me. but i am scared management won‚Äôt believe me. I am scared of them blaming me for what happening to me. i am scared of retaliation from him. but i am also scared every time he comes in now. 

I apologize for this very long post but if anyone has experience anything like this, what did you do and what happened? I could really use some hope in this situation. thanks <3",39,1727988636.0,TalesFromYourServer,8,0.98,False

I tried cleaning it up and read that baking soda could help. Now, long story short, both the baking soda and coffee have ended up underneath the console, visible through the holes (as shown in the second picture).

The dealership is quoting me between $500 and $700 to fully disassemble the center console and clean underneath it. They‚Äôre concerned about moisture and possible damage to the electronics, saying it would take at least 3-4 hours at $140 an hour.

While this is one solution, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if there‚Äôs a less drastic, more affordable option. The problem is, I can taste and feel the baking soda particles in my chest when I drive, so leaving it as is isn‚Äôt an option. I‚Äôve been dealing with this for almost two weeks, and I literally can‚Äôt drive my new car. Fortunately, I have a second car to use, but the frustration, disappointment, and anxiety are through the roof.

Is the dealership being overly cautious, or is their ‚Äúnuclear option‚Äù the best approach? Would going to a detailer be a more reasonable solution, or could that lead to bigger problems down the road, like moisture, mold, or damage?

I found a PDF on how to remove the center console, and it doesn‚Äôt look as complicated as the dealership is making it sound, but I‚Äôm not very mechanically inclined. I really don‚Äôt want to risk messing up my car further with a DIY approach.

I am considering buying a Bunn, or Curtis tea brewer, but I'm having trouble finding info on exactly how they work. They have tea brew settings, but the way that the physical machine is set up leads me to believe that it's similar to a drip coffee style, where the water simply passes through the loose leaf tea and drips down out the bottom. I imagine that this is going to get me a very different effect from steeping a large bag of tea in hot water for a long period of time.

Can someone who has had experience with these machines explain to me how the tea brewing works on them, and if it will produce similar results to actually steeping tea. As you know the tea for boba must be quite strong for the flavor to come through.",1,1727988299.0,boba,1,1.0,False

I walked out. I got a job as a hha, but I messed up and lost my job. I lost my apartment, and a bunch of bills simultaneously piled up over several thousand dollars causing this whole year for me to be in debt. I had to move back in with my father, who didn‚Äôt want me there at all. I got a new hha job and was bullied for months before I left. I took a temp gig at a coffee shop, before going to a construction company. I was hazed to shit for being a non blue collar guy and a nurses aide, which in their eyes said they thought I was gay and taunted me. I eventually was terminated because I didn‚Äôt fit the position or what they wanted. Found out later they only hired me to prevent another person from getting the position and as soon as they fired that guy, they were looking for my replacement. So now I am jobless, in debt, and broke. The only good thing that has come out of this year is I got a girlfriend, and I feel horrible because she deserves better than a loser like me. I am almost tempted to break up with her so she can find somebody better. I can‚Äôt afford therapy. I am miserable. I am always afraid of what is coming around the corner.

Wish me luck!

Long story short when I graduated university in 2016 I was slightly overweight probably around 85kg. And because of various reasons such as bad job prospect in my career, it led me to overworking (multiple jobs), lack of sleep, stress and overeating. I went on to work abroad and I wasn't able to fix some bad habits although I did go to gym regularly at some points.

COVID further emphasized my problems and stress. 

The company I was working for recently laid off all the staff so I decided to take the opportunity to take a life break and regain control of my health.

I moved somewhere cheaper a bit over 2 weeks ago and planning to stay here for 6 months. Going to the gym 6 days a week since a few days after arriving. I'm planning to water fast 14 or 21 days I haven't decided yet because I want to avoid permanent damage that are somewhat still unclear to me (if anyone has clear information on fast longer than 14-21 days except anecdotal evidence on YouTube because we don't know the long term effect on important muscles such as heart).

I'm probably going to go through 2-3 weeks of refeeding after on OMAD / keto and might do 14-21 days again after. 

I took a blood work unfortunately after alrdy starting my fast as something came up the first day so I took it at 36 hours into fasting. I have a previous blood work from last December as well. Planning to follow up bloodwork at 3 and 6 months mark.

History of fasting: I did many small fast of 24 hours. I did a lot of OMAD. I did some 36-12. I did 72 hours mid week with somewhat unrestricted weekend. In 2012 I did a 8 days fast cause my digestion was pretty bad and I wanted to lose some extra weight as well and it did help with the digestion. I was about 75kg at that time after the 8 days fast. 

I bought my electrolytes. Unfortunately there is no ""no salt"" here but I was able to get ""lite salt"" and I have magnesium supplement from doctors best. I'm planning to dissolve 3 pills of magnesium and 3 teaspoon of lite salt in 1.5L everyday and sip it throughout the day. It taste like shit but it is what it is.

I'm keeping my black coffee once or twice a day. Sorry for the purist but this is the only thing that makes me tolerate long fasting.

Now I'm having issues swallowing sometimes??","Firstly, I'm American and I work in a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, and deal with a large amount of chemicals that are carcinogenic, mutagenic, etcetera. Lots of DCM, ethyl acetate, DMSO.

I've had a headache for almost a month now, and I do not have any history of headaches lasting more than a day. I first went about a week with the headache before I went in to the walk in and they gave me prednisolone, and after a week of taking it there was no difference so I saw my family doctor and he said it might be a sinus infection (and by this point the pains in my head also moved down to the point I feel it in my teeth and nose almost like a normal sinus infection) so I was given Prednisone and an antibiotic. 
Well I finished up both the Prednisone and antibiotic and I still have the splitting headache. 9.5/10 on the pain rating.
When I try eating, if I don't have the headache then I'm unable to swallow. I've inhaled water when I tried to swallow on about 4 occasions, and it came back up when I coughed. Swallowing food also burns my chest as if I just swallowed super hot coffee, but this is simple things like rice or a nectarine.

I don't know what to do next. I'm worried since someone made a brain tumor joke, and really I'm afraid it might.",1,1727987669.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I was hoping somebody may be able to give me some advice on the best way to extract coffee flavour from coffee beans/ground beans into my milk to use in my ice cream (when making 15-20L batches).

There is a  specific coffee bean I want to use for my ice cream, so at the moment I have just been heating the milk to near boiling and then pouring over the grounds and leaving to steep for 24 hours. The problems I have with this method are:

1. Heating all the milk for a large batch and takes a while to heat and then is a hassle to cool safely
2. Sieving out the coffee grounds is a bit of a pain and it carries of about 20% of the milk when using ground beans
3. After steeping the mix then has to be heated up again to combine sugars and hydrate stabilisers before then chilling and aging
4. All this heating and chilling means it is a few days in the making to produce a batch of this ice cream

So im thinking there must be a better way??? Any suggestions welcome!",2,1727987585.0,icecreamery,6,1.0,False

I got dropped off and when I went to rate and tip, I noticed the driver hadn't ended the ride.  I was already in queue for my morning coffee and didn't think much of it, but by the time I was done, I got a notification that the driver had cancelled the ride.

This was a $19 ride (for me) that I was planning on tipping $10 for since I always feel guilty it's out of the way from what I'd consider a hot pickup zone, and the driver drove excellently.

I can't imagine the driver cancelled the ride for any reason other than the app was fucking up and not letting them end the ride for whatever reason.  We didn't have any type of conversation that would have lead them to think ""this one is on me"" either, lol.

I have tried my best to get in touch with Lyft support but all of the support options are geared towards something going wrong with the driver, and I don't dare click on one of those in the hopes of rectifying this.

I was unable to find any way to contact a human in the app, all the phone numbers I find for support when googling it seem to have been deprecated or a dead end as well, and since I don't have any other social media besides reddit, I was hoping that maybe this community could help me out here.

1. Would the driver have been able to easily rectify this and get paid? Should I not be worried?
2. Is there a support option that someone here can provide me with so I can assist in the defense of the driver and make sure they are properly compensated?

This was in the U.S. if that makes a difference. Please let me know what I can do to help this driver out, I don't want them to get screwed over to my benefit.

\*\*\*

This place. I hate the way Daniel treats it. He‚Äôs always been a clutter bug. Comes in from work, kicks his shoes and socks off, stinks the place out and flops out to watch TV. What a prick! Seriously, if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that when we were dating I quit my job and I haven‚Äôt been able to find another one I‚Äôd dip right out. That said as much as I gripe about his house-keeping at least he hasn‚Äôt kicked me out. In some ways it‚Äôs better for us to be split up. We don‚Äôt fight as much although it‚Äôs awkward as hell. Especially now that Melanie has partly moved in. It‚Äôs that bitch‚Äôs fault we have to live like this. I did everything for him: he wanted me to dress in bodycon dresses and do my make up, I did it. He wanted me to quit my job and be a tradwife, I did it. Then I get home from Kroger one day and I find him balls deep in that homewrecking whore! I mean, ok we weren‚Äôt married or anything but I love him. I did everything for that man. I was willing to carry his kids if he asked me too and he did that to me. God, that fight. We‚Äôve never had one like it since but we also never got back together. He chose Melanie over me. You know what? I‚Äôm better than her, one day he‚Äôll treat her the way he treated me and then she‚Äôll have to sleep on the sofa and I‚Äôm gonna laugh. I should‚Äôve listened to my mother. She always said there‚Äôs always someone younger and prettier than you.

I walk across the room and go and sit at the dining table. They never push the chairs in. It‚Äôs like they have no pride. I‚Äôm sure Melanie does it just to annoy me. I‚Äôm going to be out of here as soon as I can. I just need a job and then a few months to save up so I can put a deposit down. Fuck me, they‚Äôre asking 2 months deposit now. What‚Äôs more is I can‚Äôt even get on the fucking welfare because I can sleep on Daniel‚Äôs sofa and we don‚Äôt have children. How‚Äôs that for you? We didn‚Äôt have kids we couldn‚Äôt afford and now when I need help I‚Äôm told to jog the hell on. I hear the door open and Melanie gets in. ‚ÄúHey‚Äù I say clearly not interested.

‚ÄúHiya!‚Äù she beams as if we‚Äôre best friends

‚ÄúHey gorgeous, how was your day?‚Äù Daniel says casually turning his head from some bizarre adult cartoon he‚Äôs streaming. I look up and grunt. He never used to ask me how my day was, even before I quit waiting tables and moved in permanently. I pretend I don‚Äôt care and carry on looking at the job boards. The sooner I can get money the sooner I can move out of this Chernobyl reactor.

‚ÄúIt was really good, the team met all our sales targets so we‚Äôre getting a little bonus this month.‚Äù She smiled smugly and toyed with her straightened blonde hair. ‚ÄúI was thinking you and I could go on a little trip‚Äù she continued coyly. My head swivelled up. If they were on a trip they‚Äôd be out of the house and I would be able to have some peace. I would get a break from seeing the love of my life and the woman he left me for slobbering over each other. This was the most beautiful, elating thought. I found myself happy for Melanie.

‚ÄúOh my god that‚Äôs great!‚Äù I found myself saying. ‚ÄúYou should go to Florida‚Äù

‚ÄúI was thinking Hawaii. You‚Äôve got some time due. C‚Äômon it‚Äôd be fun‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, c‚Äômon Daniel it‚Äôll be fun‚Äù I found myself parroting her. Daniel didn‚Äôt seem sold on the idea. He tilted his head back. He was thinking about it. ‚ÄúYou two go off and enjoy yourselves. I‚Äôll be fine here by myself. I‚Äôll take care of everything‚Äù. Fuck, I sounded desperate. He smiled, of course he would take pleasure in my desire to not have his rejection rubbed in my face.

‚ÄúYou know what? Hawaii it is.‚Äù He got up and walked over to her. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her. I felt bile rise up, tears well up in my eyes. Why? Why did they feel the need to do this to me. He gently pushed her back onto the table I was doing my job search at. Oh god, I knew what was coming. I wretched and left the room almost blinded by my tears closing the laptop. They looked at me shocked as if they hadn‚Äôt expected me to still be broken hearted by their selfish, hormone driven lusts.

Perhaps I had been so long that I was beginning to enjoy my pain and sadness. A masochistic urge filled me and I found myself at their bedroom door listening to the groans and moans. Crying to myself: reduced to a pathetic cuck due to my stupid decisions. I dare not look. Not yet, anyway. I couldn‚Äôt bear to know: what did she do that I didn‚Äôt? Did I want to know? What if there wasn‚Äôt anything at all and she was just another warm, wet hole for him to stick it in? The more these poisonous, intrusive thoughts swarmed in my mind the harder I wept. I covered my mouth to choke out the noises just in case they heard me and kicked me out. That would be it. Homeless a pretty young woman at the mercy of the streets at best I could hope some drug dealer would get me hooked on whatever poison he was peddling at worst I‚Äôd be gang raped by the swarms of homeless before being dumped in a ditch to die. 60% of homeless in the US are men, most are mentally ill and haven‚Äôt seen a woman in years and a clean 25 year old woman would look scrumptious to them like a slice of cake. The sound of Daniel‚Äôs orgasm snapped me out of my terror of the streets. I heard Melanie beg him to finish her off. A small piece of satisfaction crossed me. At least she‚Äôs not getting any more pleasure than I got. I wandered back to the sofa and snuggled myself in the various blankets and snuggies. I wiped away my tears and the desire to punish myself returned. I had created this situation for myself. Women since the 80‚Äôs had been warning us girls to be careful. Always have your own money in case it doesn‚Äôt work out. Of course I knew better. So often it‚Äôs the hubris of the young ‚Äòmy relationship is different, it won‚Äôt happen to me, I‚Äôm not like those people‚Äô my bones rattle with chill at all the people whose advice I‚Äôd spurned. None of whom would talk to me now. Truly I was alone.

Daniel & Melanie had left for Hawaii giving me full autonomy. This was how things should be. I set about cleaning and organising. For some reason they shut the power off before they left. I imagine it was probably to give them peace of mind. I even went out and trimmed the garden. I weeded and trimmed the hedges. I noticed one of the neighbours seemed stunned. I waved at him. I knew him and he knew me but didn‚Äôt wave back. I suddenly felt a cold pang shoot down my spine: what had Daniel said about me? I put the shears down and walked to the edge of the lawn. ‚ÄúAre you ok Gary?‚Äù I said trying to summon the chirpy voice I used when we entertained Daniel‚Äôs friends and family. He just stared. ‚ÄúIs something wrong? Can I help at all?‚Äù He shook his head and went back to reading a historical novel. I smiled and suddenly realised I hadn‚Äôt been outside in a while. Poor Gary probably forgot I lived here. I laughed to myself and went back into the house.¬†

Oh yes, free reign was good. After making the house presentable I sat down to watch TV. No sharing, no gross snogging, no complaints about the signal. That was a thing since we split up. The TV was starting to go. Every so often the signal would drop slightly. Daniel would throw a major bitch fit about it. I told him it‚Äôs a TV almost as old as you are. Eventually it‚Äôs going to give out. If you don‚Äôt like it, get a new one. Of course since I‚Äôm telling him to do it the words fall on deaf ears.¬†

I found myself fantasising about my new life. What colour I would paint the walls, what flowers I‚Äôd grow in my garden. I would find myself a boss who saw something in me and would decide to give me a chance. Then it would turn out he has a nice mobile home and as long as I pay the rent on time and turn up to work I could live there. Oh yes, this would happen. I felt it, something would happen soon and I would be free of this place.

I decided to do the back garden as well after I hung the laundry. It almost felt like my old life. A basket and the breeze. I would be out hanging clothes in one of my tightly fitted dresses, merrily waiting for Daniel to return. I found myself returning to the role as if I‚Äôd never left. Perhaps this was the way one grieved or perhaps just how I grieved. It came to my attention that I should come outside more often. Maybe not leave but at least come out. I walk around feeling the sun on my face and sigh. My eyes glide towards an azalea bush and I can‚Äôt help but smile, reliving the happiness I once had. The life I could have had. Daniel and me with our perfectly manicured lawn, roses lining a picket fence and two children playing in the garden. I, the dutiful wife, baking apple pie. It seems so laughable now. Now it‚Äôs me sleeping on a sofa with a high school education unable to get a job because my last work was 4 years ago as a waitress at a diner and now you need a degree to flip burgers. As my eyes pan the garden I notice some new additions. I felt a pain in my stomach as it lurched. Melanie had been planting things in my garden. She‚Äôd not only forced me out of my bedroom but now she was forcing me out of my safe space! Fuck that. I stomped over to some primulas and a hydrangea and started ripping them up. There was even a yellow rose, my favourite. That bitch could take my man, take my home, take my space but she wasn‚Äôt going to take my title. There was only one yellow rose of Texas!!!

All my hatred, all my anger, all my pain came to the surface and I found myself screaming as I tore out plants flinging them across the garden. Rage had gotten to me and a wave of insanity had freed me from the norms and societal niceties. Now it was just me and the corpse of my american dream. I grabbed the rose and tore at it. The flora wasn‚Äôt as pathetic as me and wouldn‚Äôt let another woman move her. Its thorns dug into my skin and shredded my hands. I cried and screamed though I didn‚Äôt register the pain. No! I would win this! I dug like a rabid, furious animal to uproot it. Finally I heard the roots ripping and smiled at my small victory before stamping on the bush. Just as quickly as I had lost my sanity it returned to me and the reality of what I‚Äôd done set in. I was done. I looked at the state of the garden and I knew they‚Äôd kick me out. Panic set in. I looked at the beaten rose bush who had done nothing but happen to be Daniel‚Äôs pet name for me. Perhaps if I quickly replanted it it could be saved. Yes, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do; I‚Äôd replant the rose and the hydrangea and I‚Äôd just say animals dug up the decimated primulas. I turned my head to look at the hole and then I noticed. Deep beneath the roots of the rose was a skull. I found my jaw hanging open and suddenly I realised the skull was human. Its eye sockets had bits of rose roots still in them staring up at me. This rose had been planted above someone's head.

I had no words. The skull looked ancient, not that I know anything about ageing a skull. I dare not touch it. My hands were already filthy from digging up the rose in a manic fury. I pondered whether this was a historical skeleton. You hear about these things, you know? Civil war skeletons found in backyards or parks accidentally built on indian burial grounds. That had to explain it. Maybe this guy was a Mexican, the Alamo wasn‚Äôt too far away, maybe an hour. This guy could‚Äôve died on the way to the Alamo, yes that‚Äôs it. That had to be it. Daniel couldn‚Äôt have killed someone, no way. He was a fucking mall cop. No way. Just no. I have no idea how long I stood staring into the empty eye sockets of this skull trying to rationalise what I was seeing. I eventually snapped out of it though and clocked that I need to put everything back the way it was. Out of sight, out of mind. I replanted everything the best I could and watered the garden. When I finished trying to undo the damage I had caused I found myself scrubbing my hands, they were shaking. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I couldn‚Äôt think of anything except the body buried in the garden. Should I call the cops? Should I even tell Daniel & Melanie? If I call the cops and Daniel & Melanie are arrested I‚Äôd lose my home: I have no legal right to be here after all. If I tell Daniel & Melanie they‚Äôll know I vandalised their property and will kick me out. I need somewhere to live, what‚Äôs the point of being a good samaritan if that good samaritan is punished by society? So I decided on door number 3, do nothing. It‚Äôs not that difficult. I'm sure people are always walking around on dead people. Plague pits, mass graves they get built over all the time. I even heard there was a church built on top of a mass grave. I mean if the church can do it? Besides, there are worse things going on in the world than this. I mean, there are people who stand by and watch a girl get gang raped at school or commuters sitting by while hood rats stab someone for their shoes. I‚Äôm not harming anyone.¬†

As I lay in the bed Daniel and I once shared the body in the garden still haunted my mind. I found myself looking at the clock to see if I‚Äôd fallen asleep at all. Nope, in fact only 15 minutes had passed since I last looked. In the late afternoon I had an intrusive thought: what if it wasn‚Äôt a historical skeleton. What if it was someone‚Äôs son, daughter, brother or sister? What if it was the girl before me? What if she didn‚Äôt play ball? What if she didn‚Äôt want to sleep on the sofa. No, not Daniel. He‚Äôs a fool, he‚Äôs a cheater but he‚Äôs not a murderer. Then it hit me: what if Melanie found out about the other woman? I started to hyperventilate at this epiphany. What if she‚Äôd looked at Daniel‚Äôs phone and found his eyes wondering again? She‚Äôs seen how I live. It would be her or the other woman, why not just eliminate the competition. Dating sucks Daniel would just assume he‚Äôd been ghosted. Fuck it all makes sense now. I reached for the phone then stopped.¬†

If she was arrested Daniel would surely kick me out. My quivering hand withdrew and I found myself talking aloud. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any evidence of anything. It could be an old halloween prop for all I know‚Äù I curled my legs to my chest and wrapped the duvet around myself like a blanket of protection. ‚ÄúWhat if she has family?‚Äù I sobbed and just as quickly my head sprung up. ‚ÄúYou know what, fuck her!‚Äù I said to the mirrored wardrobe only showing a dark silhouette. ‚ÄúShe shouldn‚Äôt be creeping around with someone elses man, fucking whore. I don‚Äôt owe her anything. I don‚Äôt owe society anything the one time I asked for help they as good as told me to go fuck myself. Why should I risk my home so some dead woman can go into the ground? She‚Äôs already there and clearly nobody misses her‚Äù I got up furious at my own conscience for making me feel like crap. I shuffled down to the kitchen and put my hand on the handle for the fridge. Three deep breaths and my nerves were starting to calm down. I looked out the window at the yellow rose bush. I blinked slowly at the sudden realisation I didn‚Äôt even know if it was a man or woman in that flower bed. I sighed and went to bed. I checked the time, 3:15 in the morning. I started to take slow deep breaths and drift off to sleep.

The remaining days seemed to pass like a dream. I avoided the back garden except for hanging the laundry but a thought occurred to me: if I couldn‚Äôt get a job to get me out of this house I‚Äôd need to find a man. I groaned to myself. I felt dirty resorting to such repugnant methods. I started to open accounts on sugar daddy websites. There were some photos of me already on the computer when I was happy so I looked far better. I wrote my bio in the most honest way I could without sounding desperate: *‚ÄòHi! Texas native here. I‚Äôm currently in an awkward situation where I have to live with my ex. I‚Äôm happy to cook, clean and look the part. My specialty dish is a triple chocolate brownie. I don‚Äôt have children and am open to all types of relationships. If you want a happily ever after or just a happy ending let me know. Only condition is that you get me out of my ex‚Äôs house.* Within an hour I had a few nibbles. Most of them were trying to fish for no strings sex. It took all my courage to not tell them: unless you have 3 speeds and 12 vibration settings you aren‚Äôt bringing anything new to the table. A day later I got a message that wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äòsend nudes‚Äô. The guys name was Michael. His hair was grey but at least had hair, a dad bod but his suits hid it well and it said he owned a trucking company. He wasn‚Äôt ugly to look at but I could tell this was a guy who in his youth had a different girl every week. He was definitely the type of guy who thought he would be the terror of the ladies forever. All of a sudden the greys came along, the belly got bigger and suddenly women were refusing his charming smile. So now he needed to use his wealth and success to secure a woman to put up with him in his old age. I shrugged: beggars can‚Äôt be choosers and we started to converse.

Talking to Michael gradually made me forget about the skeleton in the garden. There were moments at night thought when I was sure it moved under the rose and looked at me. The remaining days flew by before Melanie & Daniel got home. They were so tired from their flight they barely recognised the place and didn‚Äôt even notice me. Bizarrely enough when I moved back to the coach I felt better. At night I didn‚Äôt think about the body in the garden and by day I could talk to Michael. Daniel seemed unsettled though as I sat on the sofa he started probing Melanie. ‚ÄúSo have you stopped looking for a new job?‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù she said confused

‚ÄúYou know a new job. You used to be on the job boards a lot‚Äù he said, drying the dishes as she washed them.

‚ÄúDaniel, I just got a bonus at my current job. Why would I look for a new one‚Äù she said. The way she said it was odd. It was condescending, rude, like he was a dribbling simpleton. Something turned in me and I returned to hating her but I couldn‚Äôt rock the boat, at least not until Michael had sorted me a place to live. ‚ÄúHey come on guys you just had a great holiday don‚Äôt ruin it by fighting‚Äù I said. Daniel‚Äôs eyes were fixed on Melanie.

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù he said slowly. ‚ÄúOk, makes sense‚Äù then he backed off. He didn‚Äôt turn away from Melanie but he slinked into the hall. Something unnerved me about the way he spoke. Like he was distrusting of her. Did he know about the body in the garden? Was he in on it? Did he know she was capable of killing him? I put my hand on him and he shuddered. ‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs not a big deal. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs just annoyed that only a few days back and you're talking about work‚Äù. What the hell was I doing? I thought to myself. I want them to fight! I want that bitch out of my house. Then Daniel and I can get back to the way things were. I went into the bathroom and sighed staring at my reflection in the mirror.¬†

Over the next few weeks tension was creeping back into the house. I wanted the old house back where they weren‚Äôt in it. I barely got time to message Michael. He had sent me a few apartments and condos in Houston and I was excited. It would be hard to get to but doable. Melanie would probably even drive me. I found myself elated. So happy I could finally get out. Oh and I suppose I would see Michael too. I picked a nice contemporary newbuild. Then It came: Michael wanted to meet up with me before he signed the paperwork. I asked where he suggested a hotel in Houston, he‚Äôd show me around then we‚Äôd go for dinner and afterwards we‚Äôd ‚Äòget down to it‚Äô. The mere thought of it made me retch. Scales appeared in my head: stay stuck in my ex and his toxic girlfriend‚Äôs house or sleep with Michael; how does one make that kind of choice? Don‚Äôt get me wrong he‚Äôs a nice man but ugh, my fingers hovered over the keys. I couldn‚Äôt pick what to say. I asked him to clarify and he confirmed he wanted sex. He worded it in the creepiest way possible: *I want to fuck you. This is a lot of money I‚Äôm putting down for you. I get that you‚Äôve had a bad time but you have to get over that. I‚Äôm not like other men. How about this: you suck me off and I‚Äôll put down the holding deposit? That way you know you can trust m*e. I screamed while reading that, I put my fingers to my eyes as if I was about to claw my eyes out and walked outside to the garden still screaming. What had I gotten myself into? This was borderline prostitution. I clawed and my skin trying to scrape off whatever grime had infected me. A few breaths later and a few mantras of ‚Äòyou‚Äôve got this‚Äô and ‚Äòyou‚Äôre only doing this for a way out‚Äô and I had calmed. I wandered around the garden but then I heard it. Daniel and Melanie screaming at each other. My head spun around to the house he was right in her face screaming. I ran in, as much as hated Melanie I didn‚Äôt want her to get a beating.

‚ÄúYou bitch! You fucking whore!‚Äù he screamed

‚ÄúWhat the hell is the matter with you?‚Äù Melanie shouted back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you fucking dare play that game with me you little skank I found the messages!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat messages?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom Michael! I‚Äôm your ex now am I?‚Äù he picked up a mug and threw it at Melanie‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre going to leave me? No bitch, I dictate how and when this shit ends‚Äù

‚ÄúOh really? You weren‚Äôt even man enough to leave Rose. Bitch had to find us going at it and even then you couldn‚Äôt do it‚Äù she screamed manoeuvring herself across the house.

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I yelled. ‚ÄúThose were my messages. I was trying to move out.‚Äù They ignored me or were so blinded by rage they didn‚Äôt hear me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare bring her up! I would‚Äôve taken care of her. You didn‚Äôt need to get involved. If it weren‚Äôt for you she‚Äôd still be here‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about I am here‚Äù I said, my eyes welling up as the memories from our night together returned.

‚ÄúFuck you Daniel! You weren‚Äôt ever going to do anything. The only way you ever feel good about yourself is by treating women like whores! You‚Äôre the whore! You‚Äôre not a real man, you're a bitch!‚Äù she screamed and turned to bolt. Daniel grabbed her and threw her to the ground, breaking the coffee table. I screamed as he balled his fists and beat Melanie‚Äôs face. Gasps escaped Melanie as blood and spit stained her blonde hair and turned it red. Daniel was repeating ‚ÄúBitch, fucking whore‚Äù as he punched her repeatedly in the face. I heard cracks as the bones in her face started to break. I screamed for Daniel to get of her. Melanie‚Äôs face was beginning to resemble hammered steak. I ran over to try and pull Daniel off but I couldn‚Äôt. He shivered, shuddered and began to cry and in stifled whimper said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Rose‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok Daniel just leave her and we can be together again‚Äù I said. He un-balled his fists and scrapped the parts of Melanie‚Äôs face off. I sighed and stepped back thinking he would take my hand and we could run away and live in a cabin together off of the land. He didn‚Äôt get up though instead he wrapped his hands around Melanie‚Äôs neck and squeezed.¬†

‚ÄúThis is for you, Rose‚Äù he squeezed. Melanie‚Äôs hands instinctively flew up to try and get him off of her, squeals and whimpers came out of her. Daniel started lifting her by the neck and whacking her skull against the floor again and again. There was a ripping sound as blood and hair fused to the floor from impact then finally another crack. I stared in horror as part of Melanie‚Äôs skull cap caught on the floor exposing a small amount of brain. Daniel got up and went out to the garden. I stood staring down at the woman that I‚Äôd hated for so long. ‚ÄúRose?‚Äù I looked up and saw her standing by her body in front of me. She had a confused look on her face. ‚ÄúWhat the hell? How can you be here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked feeling sudden confusion and questioning everything I just witnessed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been living with you guys since Daniel and I broke up‚Äù. Melanie shook her head.

‚ÄúNo you haven‚Äôt. I killed you. I hit you while you and Daniel were fighting. We buried you in the garden‚Äù she sounded scared, desperate. Like she wanted me to correct her. I looked back down at her body then out to the garden. I suddenly smiled. I looked back at her. Her pleading eyes begging me to tell her she‚Äôs wrong and this is all just a bad dream. ‚ÄúWell‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôll have to sleep on the sofa‚Äù. I turned away and walked out of the front door, down the path and out the gate into the light laughing as I left.

But when a heist ends in tragedy, and Lord Coppergold outlaws *the Damned*, Evie‚Äôs best friend among them, she vows to save them no matter the cost.

Building her reputation in a shady coffee den, an old friend, long thought dead, presents an unlikely scheme to find a legendary map that might save *the Damned* from annihilation. Evie can‚Äôt resist catapulting herself into the deadly world of sky-piracy alongside four eccentric renegades, all convinced the Map of Nought can end an age of oppression‚Ä¶ or begin a new one.
