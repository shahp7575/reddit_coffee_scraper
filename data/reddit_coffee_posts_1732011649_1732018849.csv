Whether you’re browsing the web, streaming your favorite shows, or shopping online, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can provide an added layer of protection for your personal data. However, VPN services, especially the most popular ones like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and CyberGhost, can sometimes be on the pricier side. The good news is that there are plenty of **VPN discount codes** available to help you save money while still enjoying top-tier online security.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about finding the best **VPN discounts**, what to look for, and how to apply these deals so you can get the most out of your subscription. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a long-time VPN user, this article will help you save big without compromising on quality.

# Why You Need a VPN in 2024

Before we dive into the details of how to find VPN discounts, let’s quickly review why having a VPN is crucial in today’s internet environment.

# 1. Protect Your Privacy

A VPN hides your real IP address and encrypts your internet traffic, ensuring that no one can track your online activities. This is especially important in a world where hackers, advertisers, and even governments are increasingly watching what you do online.

# 2. Secure Public Wi-Fi

When you connect to public Wi-Fi, such as at coffee shops or airports, you’re vulnerable to hackers. A VPN secures your connection, making it much harder for anyone to intercept your data.

# 3. Bypass Geo-Restrictions

A VPN allows you to mask your location, which is helpful if you want to access content that is restricted in your region. Whether it’s streaming services like Netflix or accessing websites that are blocked in certain countries, a VPN opens up a world of content.

# 4. Prevent Throttling

Some internet service providers (ISPs) slow down your connection when they detect heavy usage (like streaming or gaming). With a VPN, you can bypass these throttling measures and enjoy faster speeds.

# Types of VPN Discounts

When searching for **VPN discount codes**, it’s important to know what kinds of deals are available. Here are some common types of VPN discounts you’ll come across:

# 1. Percentage Off Deals

Many VPN providers offer percentage-based discounts, where you can get anywhere from **10% to 70% off** the regular price. These discounts are typically offered during special promotions like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or the provider’s anniversary.

# Example:

* **ExpressVPN** might offer **50% off** for a **1-year subscription**.
* **NordVPN** might provide a **68% discount** on their **2-year plan**.

# 2. Free Trial or Money-Back Guarantee

Some VPN services provide a **free trial** period (usually ranging from **7 to 30 days**) so you can test out their features without committing. If you decide that the VPN isn’t for you, many providers offer a **money-back guarantee** that allows you to get a full refund.

# Example:

* **CyberGhost VPN** offers a **45-day money-back guarantee**.
* **NordVPN** has a **30-day money-back policy** for all plans.

# 3. Referral Programs

Referral discounts allow you to save money by referring a friend or family member to the VPN service. Typically, both you and the person you refer will get a discount or free months of service.

# Example:

* **Surfshark** gives **1 month free** for both the referrer and the referred.

# 4. Seasonal Promotions

During major sales events like **Black Friday**, **Cyber Monday**, or **Christmas**, VPN providers often drop their prices significantly. These are some of the best times to buy a VPN subscription, as the discounts are typically huge.

# How to Find VPN Discount Codes

Now that you know what kinds of discounts are available, let’s talk about the best ways to find these **VPN discount codes**.

# 1. Official Websites

Many VPN providers offer discounts directly on their official websites. If you're looking for a seasonal deal or a special promotion, checking the VPN provider’s homepage or **pricing page** is a good place to start.

# 2. Deal Websites and Forums

Websites like **RetailMeNot**, **Groupon**, and **Honey** aggregate discount codes for various services, including VPNs. You can also check out **Reddit**, where users often post the latest VPN deals in forums like r/VPN or r/Deals.

# 3. Social Media and Newsletters

Follow VPN providers on **Twitter**, **Facebook**, and **Instagram** for special promotions and announcements. Many companies share exclusive discounts with their social media followers. Additionally, subscribing to the **VPN provider’s newsletter** will give you early access to promotions and discounts.

# 4. Coupon Aggregators

Some websites specialize in listing verified discount codes. Examples include [**Coupons.com**](http://Coupons.com) and **CouponBirds**. These sites can save you time by providing a list of all available codes.

# How to Use VPN Discount Codes

Using a VPN discount code is simple. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you apply your coupon:

# 1. Choose Your VPN Plan

Go to the VPN provider’s website and select the plan that suits your needs. Most providers offer **monthly**, **yearly**, or **2-year** plans, with the long-term options offering the best value.

# 2. Apply the Discount Code

Once you’ve chosen your plan, proceed to the checkout page. Look for a box that says **“Enter Promo Code”** or **“Discount Code”**. Paste your code into the box and click **“Apply”**. You should see the discount reflected in the final price.

# 3. Complete the Purchase

Fill in your payment information and complete the purchase. Some VPN providers accept various payment methods, including **credit cards**, **PayPal**, and even **cryptocurrency**.

# Tips for Maximizing Your VPN Discount

Here are a few tips to make sure you’re getting the best deal possible:

# 1. Combine Deals

Look for ways to stack deals. For example, some VPN providers may offer seasonal discounts on top of the discount codes shared on websites or forums. If you can combine multiple discounts, you can save even more.

# 2. Use the Money-Back Guarantee

If you’re unsure about a VPN, take advantage of the **money-back guarantee**. Try out the service and, if it’s not what you expected, get your money back and try another VPN service.

# 3. Opt for Long-Term Plans

Generally, longer subscription plans offer more significant discounts. If you’re sure you want to use a VPN long-term, choose a **2-year or 3-year plan** to get the best price.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

# 1. How do I find the best VPN discount codes?

* The best VPN discount codes can be found on deal websites, Reddit forums, official websites, and social media channels. Always make sure the code is valid before using it.

# 2. Can I use multiple discount codes for a single purchase?

* Most VPN providers only allow one code per transaction. However, you can still stack deals by waiting for seasonal promotions and using a referral link.

# 3. Are VPN discount codes available year-round?

* Yes, but the biggest discounts usually happen during specific promotional events like **Black Friday**, **Cyber Monday**, or **New Year**. Be on the lookout for these annual sales.

# 4. What happens if I don’t like the VPN service?

* Many VPN providers offer **money-back guarantees**, typically ranging from **30 to 45 days**, so you can try the service risk-free and get your money back if you're unsatisfied.

# 5. Are VPN discount codes legitimate?

* Always make sure the discount code is from a reliable source, such as the provider’s official website or well-known deal websites. If you find it on Reddit or forums, check for positive feedback from other users to confirm its validity.

Here are 4 ideas (but I'm open to completely different ones):

**1. AGI Timeline Prediction Market** (🎯 no real money, just bragging rights)

* Finally settle those ""AGI by 2030?"" debates with some skin in the game
* Watch your prediction accuracy score climb (or hilariously tank)
* Monthly milestone tracking to see who really knows their stuff
* Like fantasy football, but for the robot apocalypse

**2. AI Model Release Calendar**

* Never miss another GPT launch again
* Compare models without diving into 50 different Discord servers
* Clear ""what can it actually do?"" benchmarks
* Get pinged when something wild drops

**3. Research Paper Difficulty Rater**

* Browser extension that saves you from opening papers way above your pay grade
* Community ratings from ""ELI5"" to ""PhD Required""
* Shows what you need to know before diving in
* ""Time to comprehend"" estimates (coffee breaks vs weekend projects)

**4. AI Progress Newsletter + Extension**

* Track what you've actually read vs. saved for ""later"" (we all know how that goes)
* Weekly TL;DR of the important stuff
* Focus on real breakthroughs, not just PR
* Impact ratings from ""neat trick"" to ""call Elon""

Before I dive in and build one of these - has anyone seen something similar already? 

What would make these actually useful vs just another tool that collects dust?

But this year, I really disassociated and after my last date failed miserably, I've come peace to the fact that I'll never date again. Or so I thought.

I installed Bumble a while back, and I have to say got pretty surprised since I realized that I don't have it in me anymore. Not playing the age card, I'm just 28, but I can't keep up. In fact, the moment they open up the conversation, I would just then ask the most boring questions in the world. I used to open up with witty remarks, ask their music taste, and tell me a random fact but like I said I just don't have it in me. I managed to meet someone.

Even after meeting someone, I used to keep my options open unless there's a clear indicator that we're exclusive. It has always been like this, but I'm not sure why I decided to actually stop swiping after we transferred to Instagram. I still did, but it's more like an act of boredom and I left the new messages unread.

Everything felt like actual peace, totally no worry if one responds late since we're busy with our own lives. We talk about our day, or send reels (she sends from TikTok, I send from Instagram), or basically just talk about the most random shit. I never had to worry that she wouldn't respond anymore, while previously I was always anxious since I mostly respond late.

Fast forward, we agreed to meet. It's been a month+ of talking, and we just watched a movie. Had coffee, ate ramen, and walked her home afterward. For the first time in years, I walked someone home. While walking, she said ""ang saya nito, lakad lang"". I'm trying so hard to hide my smile because it's a personal favorite, walk dates. In the era of dates having to be expensive, she specifically found joy in walking, and in this instance, with me.

No mention of sex or whatsoever, we never even hugged or held hands. But everything was enough, she was. It's also a plus since I've been trying to abstain after being sexually active for a very long while. And again, I don't have it in me anymore.

Bihira ako kiliigin, pero kinilig ulit ako. Umabot sa point na pati yung date naikwento ko sa client ko nung tinanong niya ako kung anong ginawa ko last weekend. Sinabi niya pa na ""you were smiling for like 2 minutes before telling me what it was, now I know why"". Hindi ako naniniwala sa mga jinx, pero bigla akong napahiling kay Lord na balato niya na sa akin to.

Many people on this sub consider EasyDiner not too useful and by extension, EasyDiner IndusInd CC as well. I would say that for someone who likes to eat-out 3-4 times in a month on an average budget of 3-6k per outing, EasyDiner Prime can do wonders.

I have had scrumptious buffett at 4-5 star hotels at per head price of under Rs.400 - that’s equivalent of one starbucks coffee. Sometimes I pay as less as 35% of the non-EasyDiner price for the same value of services. 

While not every restaurant is on EasyDiner offer, but that is not the point since you would anyway spend the full value if you don’t opt for EasyDiner. I maximise value through a choice of restaurants with 1+1 or 50% off, combined with Kotak Everyday debit card.

Everyday debit card is so underrated I don’t know why anyone doesn’t talk about it. With everyday card, I get 30% off upto Rs.1000 with no minimum transaction value (best value even when compared with EasyDiner CC). It is very easy to get as well unlike CC which was denied to me due to a KYC fuckup. In my opinion, one should get the LTF version of the indusind card as 30k expense in a quarter is too easy to meet (expenses not eligible for high reward rate such as insurance, education, taxes can be directed here). 

For a 50% eligible restaurant, on a Rs.5000 bill, I would end up roughly paying rs.1850 including EasyDiner convenience fee (37%).

With various materials available, including wood, glass, marble, metal, and upholstered surfaces, maintaining your coffee table requires specific care strategies to preserve its look and longevity.

https://preview.redd.it/4liaykuymu1e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a94753762b582b487f8bfd5f8e32fd66671737f

This comprehensive guide provides insights into caring for different types of coffee tables, including practical cleaning tips, protection techniques, and maintenance routines to keep your coffee table looking its best.

# 1. Caring for Wooden Coffee Tables

Wooden coffee tables are popular for their natural beauty and durability. However, they can be susceptible to scratches, stains, and warping if not properly maintained.

# Cleaning and Maintenance Tips

* **Dust Regularly:** Use a soft, lint-free cloth to dust the surface weekly. This prevents the buildup of dirt and grime that can scratch the finish.
* **Use Mild Soap for Cleaning:** For deeper cleaning, mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water. Dampen a cloth with the mixture and gently wipe the table. Avoid using too much water, as wood can absorb moisture, leading to warping or damage.
* **Protect from Heat and Moisture:** Always use coasters for drinks and place mats for hot dishes. Exposure to moisture and heat can cause wood to expand or crack.
* **Polish for a Natural Shine:** Use a furniture polish or wax formulated for wood once every few months to maintain a natural shine and protect the finish. Be sure to follow the product instructions carefully.

# Repairing Scratches and Minor Damage

* **Scratch Removal:** For minor scratches, rub a mixture of equal parts olive oil and vinegar into the scratch using a soft cloth. Wipe off any excess to restore the finish.
* **Fixing Water Rings:** Water rings from glasses can be removed by applying non-gel toothpaste or a mixture of baking soda and water to the affected area, followed by gentle rubbing and polishing.

For a great example of a wooden coffee table, check out the [Convenience Concepts American Heritage Round Coffee Table](https://www.ojcommerce.com/convenience-concepts-american-heritage-round-coffee-table-shelf-r6-360-p?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=blog_bl0208), which features a classic design that requires proper care to maintain its elegance.

# 2. Caring for Glass Coffee Tables

Glass coffee tables offer a sleek, modern look, but they easily show smudges, fingerprints, and dust.

# Cleaning and Maintenance Tips

* **Use a Glass Cleaner:** To keep the surface streak-free, use a high-quality glass cleaner or a mixture of equal parts water and vinegar. Wipe with a microfiber cloth for a spotless finish.
* **Avoid Abrasive Materials:** Do not use rough sponges or harsh cleaning agents, as they can scratch the glass. Soft, non-abrasive cloths are ideal for cleaning.
* **Place Mats and Coasters:** To prevent scratches, always use coasters and place mats for objects placed on the table. Consider using felt pads under decorative items.

# Long-Term Care Considerations

* **Minimize the Risk of Breakage:** Avoid placing heavy objects on the glass, as this can cause cracks or chips over time.
* **Protect the Edges:** The edges of glass tables are especially prone to damage. Using edge protectors can help prevent accidental chipping.

For example, you can launch a fast-food restaurant in your city. This gives you a way to jump into business with a brand that's already well-known and not spend money on brand promotion. 
2. **You buy an existing franchise:** You've found a local store that's already part of a franchise network, and you want to buy it. Picture taking over a neighborhood gym that's been under a franchise for years. Purchasing gives you access to an already successful business model and customer base.
3. **You open new locations:** If you own a franchise and are ready to open more outlets to boost your business growth, think about adding new locations in nearby cities or towns. This strategy allows you to reach more customers and increase profits.
4. **You sell your business:** If you're planning to hand over the franchise to someone else, like a family member, you'll need to fill out a new [franchise agreement template](https://lawrina.org/templates/franchise-agreement/). Imagine passing on your coffee shop to your daughter. This ensures the business continues smoothly under new ownership.

Here's what actually happens behind the scenes of that Amazon package at your door or that banana in your grocery store:

# The Symphony Begins: Demand Planning

Imagine predicting exactly how many black t-shirts people will want six months from now. That's what we do, using everything from historical data to weather patterns to TikTok trends. One slight miscalculation and you've either got angry customers or a warehouse full of unwanted inventory eating into your profits.

# The Global Dance: Sourcing & Procurement

We're like international relationship managers. That chip shortage affecting your PS5 purchase? That's because someone needs to:

* Negotiate with suppliers across 5 different time zones
* Navigate trade regulations that change monthly
* Balance cost savings with reliability
* Have backup suppliers for their backup suppliers

# The Logistics Tango

Remember the Ever Given blocking the Suez Canal? That was our industry's equivalent of a heart attack. We had to:

1. Reroute thousands of containers
2. Calculate new arrival times
3. Adjust production schedules globally
4. Explain to management why costs just tripled

# The Real Magic: Risk Management

You know what keeps us up at night?

* Natural disasters disrupting key routes
* Political tensions affecting trade lanes
* Factory fires halfway across the world
* Labor strikes at major ports
* That one crucial supplier who won't answer emails

# Why This Matters

Every time you grab something off a shelf, you're experiencing the end result of thousands of people making millions of decisions. That $5 coffee? It involved farmers, processors, shippers, roasters, packagers, and distributors all coordinating across continents.

# The Future is Wild

We're seeing some mind-blowing changes:

* AI predicting demand patterns before humans spot them
* Blockchain tracking items from source to shelf
* Autonomous vehicles reimagining last-mile delivery
* 3D printing threatening to upend traditional manufacturing

# What We've Learned from COVID

The pandemic taught us that:

* ""Just-in-time"" isn't always smart
* Resilience beats efficiency
* Local sourcing isn't just trendy, it's strategic
* Your backup plan needs a backup plan

# For Those Considering This Career

If you:

* Love solving complex puzzles
* Can think globally but act locally
* Don't mind occasional 3 AM crisis calls
* Get excited about optimization

Then welcome aboard! We're always looking for fresh perspectives in this field.

Edit: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for all the great questions. Yes, I'll do a follow-up post about breaking into the industry!

*TLDR: Supply chain management is like conducting an orchestra where half the musicians are in different time zones, the sheet music keeps changing, and sometimes the instruments get stuck in customs. But when it works, it's beautiful.*",1,1732017549.0,KenyaSupplyChain,0,1.0,False

Stupid reasons like that) l've been looking up and down for work and it seems like my options are running dry where i live. I'm contemplating moving a couple hours away (4.5) to a bigger city where more jobs would be available to me. Bf works a stable job at the moment, and with his income we are able to just float above water, but we are slowly drowning. We recently bought a house last year, and it's EXTREMELY expensive to be in, especially with the cost of everything going up. Bf used to be working a very well paying job, but his project ended in november last year, and then come july of this year he found his current job that's stable.

My thinking is if i can find a better job (i work mainly in labour and warehousing which typically pays pretty well but in my town there aren't a lot of warehousing jobs) in that bigger city i'll be able to actually HOLD A JOB where i don't get royally fucked over. I'll be earning more and able to send the money necessary (i mainly pay utilities and groceries) back home to bf where he will be able to get ahead and i'll be able to help pay bills.

I also want to move for selfish reasons. I hate where i live, it's so unbearably boring, there's nothing to do, i have no friends, and i just sit at home 24/7. The city i want to move to has all of the things i love in it. Art museums, cute coffee shops, more girls i could meet to actually have friends, (there's a friend of mine that already lives there) just so much more things attuned to what i actually enjoy. Bf is content where we are, he's satisfied working and then coming home. But i don't want to do that, i want to go out and see these museums and make girlfriends and have experiences that aren't struggle to find job, get job, get canned from job, stay home, make dinner for bf, go to sleep, repeat. It's eating me alive and i don't want to just ditch him either so it's a very tossing situation. I love my bf and i have no qualms with him at all it's just the town, my lack of actual enjoyment in life, and struggling to find work.

(Random context: i live in an oilfield town, so unless you're a rig pig, you can't really make any money. 

TLDR: I want to move away from bf to find a better job but idk if it’s a stupid decision or not. ",3,1732017014.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Drills stacked on drills, systems failing faster than you could fix them, and the COB stomping around bitching about terroristic dirt. Morale? Lower than a whale’s nutsack. Fresh out of refit, we were barely holding it together. And that’s when two well-meaning but green sailors—nubs, as we call them, decided to liven things up.

For the uninitiated, a nub is a sailor who hasn’t earned their dolphins yet. They’re trained, sharp, and eager to prove themselves, but they lack real operational experience, which often leads to moments like this one.

It all started in the torpedo room. The AEF, short for Auxiliary Electrician Forward, was one of those nubs still figuring out how to balance enthusiasm with competence. His job was keeping the forward compartments powered and running, critical, but not exactly glamorous. 

Then there was the LL Watch, short for Lower Level Watch, who spent his time babysitting systems deep in the boat’s guts. His job? Make sure nothing broke, caught fire, or exploded. It was the kind of job that gave him plenty of time to fuck around and find out.

Two nubs, barely out of their final checkouts and practically on their first big-boy watch, decided they had something to prove. They were unsupervised, unafraid, and most importantly, unaware of how badly this was about to go.

“One! One! One! One!”

That was the LL Watch, his voice carrying all the way down to my rack in 21-man like a bad sonar echo. I rolled out of my coffin, annoyed as hell. I figured I’d head down and tell them to shut the fuck up before the COB showed up.

By the time I made it to the torpedo room, I paused just outside the p way. I didn’t want to storm in blind, so I leaned against the frame and observed. The scene was already a train wreck.

The AEF, red-faced and committed, was trying to crank out push-ups on the torpedo room deck. He wasn’t doing great. 

“One! One! One! One!” the LL Watch kept shouting, doubling as both coach and troll.

“What the fuck are you even doing?” one of the SEALs asked, arms crossed as he leaned against the upper torpedo rack, watching the chaos unfold like a bad reality show.

“I’m counting!” the LL Watch snapped back, like that was obvious.

“No, you’re just saying ‘one,’” the SEAL shot back, smirking.

The AEF wheezed out, “See, fucker, I’m going all the way down,” adjusting his poopie suit for what he thought would be a solid redemption arc. Spoiler: it wasn’t.

Then the LL Watch had a brilliant idea. “Use the cup! If the cup hits your chest, then you’ll know you went down far enough!”

Now, this wasn’t just any cup. This was a boat mug. Thick as a the hull, stained with coffee, chow juice, and 10-15 years of questionable fluids. It was the kind of mug that would survive a meltdown.

The LL Watch slid the mug under the AEF’s chest like he was setting up a science experiment. “Can’t fuck it up now, shitbag!”

The AEF dropped down again, dog tags clicking. His chest barely tapped the cup with a faint clink, and the LL Watch lost it.

“One! One! One! One!” he shouted, laughing so hard he had to lean against the bulkhead.

The AEF froze, embarrassment flashing across his face before he lunged, arms wide. But the LL Watch was ready, sliding out of the way like it was choreographed. In one motion, he snatched the cup off the deck and threw a goddamn haymaker, smashing it straight into the AEF's face hole.

CRACK.

The sound was brutal. Blood sprayed as the mug connected with the AEF’s face, sending him staggering back. His teeth jutted out at odd angles, like a broken picket fence, and blood dripped from his mouth onto the deck. I still remember the scream he let out after contact. It was loud enough to wake the dead, or at least the COB.

The SEALs quickly reacted, like they’d been expecting it. Laughing their asses off, they separated the LL Watch from the dazed AEF, pulling them apart quick, fast, and in a hurry. One SEAL followed the AEF, who was staggering toward the head, blood dripping from his face, leaving dime sized red drops marking his path. 

Just as the chaos reached its peak the COB stormed in, his boots pounding the deck like a hammer to an anvil.. 

“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?” he bellowed, stomping into the torpedo room like the wrath of Neptune himself. “WHO DID THIS? I WILL SKULL-FUCK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IDIOTS!”

The room went dead silent. Even the SEALs straightened up, though I swear one of them had to bite his lip to keep from laughing.

In the end, the LL Watch got patched up, the AEF got an ass-chewing that probably still haunts him, and the SEALs walked away with a whammy of sea story they’ll probably tell at every bar from here to eternity.

As for me? I shook my head and headed back to 21-man, laughing so hard I almost pissed myself. Some underways you forget. Others, like this one, stick with you forever and never let you forget the importance of dental.",1,1732016440.0,submarinestorytime,0,1.0,False

We have 2 children together and I have 2 from a past relationship. Ages ranging from 4 to 19. In my first relationship I primarily worked as a mother but I did some part time stuff here and there and helped my husband with our business. He was weird and unfaithful so I left. I met my now husband not long after that, he was a business owner as well and I started working for him part time while still working at my own part time. Things happened in my husbands business that caused him and his partner ( a family member of his) to split up and we relocated and started to try to rebuild our business in a new area ( I am the one who wanted to move ) I thought a fresh start would be good for us. Here’s my problem 
We had discussed many times how we wanted our situation to be , we decided that I would primarily work as a mother and be his helper , which I was very content with but recently he has been saying that I should go find work. He is a contractor and when he is working he makes great money , but , he wants it to fall on his lap , literally. He will sit on the couch and mope for months on end sometimes because he has no work but he won’t go out and look for it !

When he’s home he controls every penny spent , blames me for our short comings. I cook homemade meals and lunches every day , I clean the vehicles , the entire house , all the laundry , grocery shopping , dentist doctors , I pre make health morning drinks everyday , serve him his coffee and vitamins.. split and stack all the fire wood , cut and dye my own and our kids hair , I don’t get facials or do my nails , I hardly get to shop for myself ever … and I don’t really have any friends ( that’s not his fault , I just don’t really want any right now) he doesn’t go out drinking without me or anything , like ever .. he doesn’t do much of anything to be honest, he really loves being with the kids. I don’t think he’s a terrible man , but is he ? Am I ? I just need some input , just to know if I am missing something 
One more thing , we are basically sexless as well… he has had problems with his testosterone due to being overweight and does nothing about it , so it’s been this way for about 8 years. I look after myself that way and it makes me feel disgusting

Tried both WDT and 'blind shaking' puck prep. 

Sour shot still. Preheated everything in the picopresso in a bowl of boiling hot water (including inside the chamber). 

I started at 17.5g in, 36g out. 10s preinfuse, no puck screen, double preheat of chamber. Changing 1, at most 2 variables at a time until I got down to the recipe I currently have. (About 30/40 espressos in the last week) What am I doing wrong? There must be something I've completely went over? 

I have got great espresso out of this thing before(with different beans (only preinfusing for 10s or so with basic prep) I don't want to blame the beans as ""there's no such thing as sour beans"" and its not exactly a light roast so I shouldn't be having too many problems. If I grind any finer I think it would choke the machine (it already basically is, slowly pressing once every 4 seconds during shot)

I feel like the over-extracted monster of a recipe I'm at now should be giving me horrible bitterness, but it's still sour and acidic with only a tiny tiny bit of sweetness. 

The only variable left is the ambient temperature/humidity, as we don't have the heating on in the kitchen. But this seems way too excessive measure for getting a medium roast to 'not sour' level. 

I have got 2 more bean roasts arriving so will hopefully be able to 100% rule out the 'beans' as the problem.

# 1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea is famous for its numerous health benefits, and in Nagano Tonic, it plays a key role in boosting your metabolism and providing a natural source of caffeine. It helps improve energy levels without the crash that often comes with coffee, and it’s packed with antioxidants that protect your cells from damage.

# 2. Ginseng

Ginseng is a powerhouse herb that has been used for centuries for its energy-boosting and stress-reducing properties. It helps improve mental clarity, reduce fatigue, and enhance physical performance. In Nagano Tonic, ginseng is used to help you stay alert and focused, making it a great option for anyone looking to fight brain fog or low energy.

# 3. Apple Cider Vinegar

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is well-known for its ability to support digestion and metabolism. It’s believed to help balance blood sugar levels, promote gut health, and even support weight loss by curbing appetite and improving digestion. ACV also adds a bit of tang to the tonic, which adds to its refreshing taste.

# 4. Turmeric

Turmeric contains an active compound called curcumin, which is renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It helps to reduce inflammation in the body, supporting overall wellness. Plus, turmeric is great for joint health and can help improve digestion. It’s the perfect addition to Nagano Tonic for promoting a healthy, balanced body.

# 5. Ashwagandha

If you’ve been hearing a lot about adaptogens, ashwagandha is probably one of the most popular. This herb is known for its ability to reduce stress and anxiety, promote relaxation, and enhance mood. When added to Nagano Tonic, it helps balance the body’s response to stress, making it a great ingredient for keeping calm and focused during hectic days.

# 6. Lemon Balm

Lemon balm is a gentle herb that’s often used to calm nerves and improve mood. It's known for its ability to help with sleep, reduce anxiety, and support cognitive function. In Nagano Tonic, lemon balm helps with relaxation, keeping you calm and focused even in stressful situations.

# 7. L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid found primarily in green tea, and it’s known for promoting relaxation without causing drowsiness. It works synergistically with caffeine to enhance focus and attention while helping to reduce the jittery feeling that caffeine can sometimes cause.

**Conclusion: A Blend of Natural Goodness**

The ingredients in **Nagano Tonic** are carefully chosen for their ability to support energy, metabolism, mental clarity, and overall wellness. From the antioxidant-packed **green tea extract** to the stress-relieving **ashwagandha**, each ingredient serves a specific purpose in promoting health.

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the endless stream of memes your friends send you? If so, there’s good news: replying with “Haha So True!” (HST) might be all you need to maintain those friendships with minimal effort.  



According to a very real study published in the Cranberry-Lemon Journal of Astrological Big Data Ecology (yes, that’s a thing), researchers Koothrappali & Nahasapeemapetilon 

Explored the effectiveness of HST as a low-energy strategy for digital bonding. Here’s the tea:  



The Experiment

150 participants were divided into three groups to respond to their friends’ memes:  

1. HST Group: Replied with “Haha So True!” every time.  

2. High-Effort Group: Crafted enthusiastic responses like “OMG LMAO” or “I just snorted coffee.”  

3. Silent Group: Ghosted their friends entirely.  



Researchers measured friendship satisfaction, guilt, and perceived enthusiasm using some very serious-sounding tools (like the Satisfaction Ratings of Engagement scale).  



The Findings 

\- Friendship Satisfaction: Both the HST and high-effort groups boosted satisfaction levels, while silence was a friendship killer. Interestingly, HST was just as effective as the high-effort responses.   

\- Guilt-Free Zone: The HST group felt less guilt than the silent group, proving that even low-effort replies are better than none.   

\- Effort vs. Enthusiasm: High-effort responses were seen as more enthusiastic, but HST still delivered a solid “I see you” vibe without draining emotional energy.  



The Verdict 

The study concluded that HST is a minimalist’s dream. It keeps friendships alive without requiring you to pour your soul into every text. As the authors put it, “Haha So True!” is the perfect balance of acknowledgment and emotional detachment.  



Should You Use It?  

Absolutely—unless your friend expects you to bring Shakespearean-level wit to the chat. While it’s not a replacement for genuine connection, it’s a lifeline for those “I can’t even” days.  



So next time you’re bombarded with memes, remember: a quick “Haha So True!” might just save the friendship without breaking a sweat.

*  Use a different USB cable.
*  Leave the keyboard disconnected for a few hours.
*  Replace the switch for the 1 key.

- Which is likely to be less busy from tourists but still have options for dinner/coffee stops?

EpicMFan: It’s 3am guys. Ready for a panel with u/Model-Jordology. So Jordy, what is your thoughts on everything going on right now?

Jordology: Well, let's start off my addressing the fact that, yet again, the Conservatives have refused the opportunity to speak about their plan for Canada. Canadians should be worried at this fact, because it's a perfect example of the lack of care and commitment the Tories are showing.

EpicMFan: Yes, I can agree. Let’s see the Tories drive to our studio to rebuke you… at 3am. They’ll be so groggy they won’t bother.

Jordology: Of course, over the past few days we’ve seen the Tories ignore women and promise to take away their rights if elected. What is this, The Handmaid's Tale? You’d think Hayley, a woman, would care about her own sisterhood, wouldn’t you? Then again, maybe they have abandoned her…

EpicMFan: Everyone’s abandoned her.

Jordology: I think what we’re seeing from the conservatives is very telling of that we can expect from a Tory government. Chaos, discrimination, and segregation. One could even go as far as suggesting a form of detainment could be on the cards. I know that anyone who has disagreed with Hayley will be at risk of severe harm if she becomes Prime Minister.

EpicMFan: I don’t think she’d go that far.

Jordology: Well, I do. She’s unpredictable, she’s violent and she’s vengeful. She’s the perfect example of a dictator, one that will do anything to silence opposition. No matter the cost.

EpicMFan: She’s not going to silence the NDC.

Jordology: She’s willing to put thousands of pregnant women in harms way in order to stroke her ideological ego. Who knows what she’ll do.

EpicMFan: She’s not going to be a dictator, Jordy.

Jordology: 20 bucks and a coffee from Tim Horton's. Bet?

EpicMFan: Bet.

Jordology: Let’s move on then. I’m sure you have more questions to ask.

EpicMFan: Yeah, what about the deal reached?

Jordology: Well, what a great example of a government that makes promises and delivers on them! I promised the nation we’d get this resolved quickly, and we did! Look at the outcome we’ve achieved! Everyone is happy and the unions have settled down! It’s a perfect example of what can be done when you listen to people rather than telling people what’s best for them. Looking at you, Conservatives.

EpicMFan: It all got better, didn’t it? We did a good job.

Jordology: Exactly! Because that’s what happens when the NDC runs the country. Things get better.

EpicMFan: We are so great.

Jordology: We really are. And with some very exciting announcements coming from the Liberal Party in the coming days, things are only going to get greater!

EpicMFan: Just reveal it already, Jordy… you’ve been touting this for so long.

Jordology: Absolutely not. I’m not revealing anything! You’ll have to wait to find out. I do have a challenge for the Tories tho. Specifically a politician called u/FreedomCanada2025.

EpicMFan: Yes?

Jordology: Crazygamer, everyone was underwhelmed by Tyson v Paul. Let’s give 'em a boxing match to remember. You. Me. BC Place. Let's do it.

It’s hilarious (and infuriating) how disconnected some of these privileged kids are from the reality of rural Vidarbha. For them, struggles mean traffic jams in Nagpur, while the rest of the region barely exists in their worldview.

It’s tragic how Vidarbha, a region suffering from years of farmer suicides, water scarcity, and unemployment, has become a case study for armchair intellectualism. Most of these so-called ""activists"" are privileged CBSE school passouts, sipping coffee in air-conditioned cafes, discussing ""rural development"" like it’s some theoretical class project.

They’ll write essays, participate in debates, and post on social media, but how many of them have actually been to Vidarbha's villages or talked to struggling farmers? It's all optics—hashtags and performative guilt—while the real problems remain untouched.

Vidarbha doesn’t need debates in English or token charity drives. It needs real solutions, grassroots work, and systemic change. If you care, then get out of your AC bubble, visit the region, understand the depth of its issues, and then talk about change.

Is Vidarbha just another trending issue for clout, or do people actually care? Share your thoughts.",41,1732014428.0,nagpur,6,0.94,False

A bit of background about myself : I'm 18, about to turn 19. I'm really interested in Finance, Commerce and Programming. I'm currently pursuing an undergrad in business administration in college. I also get client requests to code apps and other stuff occasionally for which i get paid decently.

I have not received any love from my father and only hate. I'd always get jealous from people with amazing fathers and sometimes in movies and books when it's shown how important a father's love is for a child and what it's like. Regardless, I live with my mother and have not seen my father from a long time nor does he ever call either.

I was always told I'm quite mature for my age and that's because I've been through some shit as a boy which a very few people have.

I fell in love with my first Girlfriend about 6 months ago. She is or was absolutely amazing and caring, it felt like we were made for each other the way we got around.I got her pregnant on accident. 

When she found out being 18 she was really scared and anxious. I comforted her immediately and told her I'd hold her hand through everything and there's no need to be scared. We decided to keep it from our parents and decided to get an abortion ASAP. My girlfriend was vomiting like crazy.

We totally kept it from our parents because we're both from VERY conservative families and sex before marriage is a big NO.

Ultimately we consulted a gynaecologist and got a date scheduled. Then the night before the abortion my girlfriend calls me and says she wants to keep it no matter what the cost. I refuse and try to counsel her but she managed to convince me and said this has happened for a reason. 

From that night on I absolutely fell in love with the idea of becoming a dad. Having a family. Loving my child as I should have been loved. A little boy or a girl who would call me dad and also love me back.

5 months in, My GF and I were incredibly excited. We were thinking of names, collecting little clothes, spending some sleepless nights too with the excitement haha.

Pregnancy has not been easy for my Girlfriend. She gets mood swings, absolutely crazy nausea and vomiting,cravings etc. I always tried to help her as much as I could and our Gynaecologist was really great too. She really appreciated my efforts.

I decided to work part time in a coffee shop and continue my studies as well as continuing taking client requests to save as much money as possiblefor our child. My GF wanted to work too but I absolutely refused and promised her that I'd afford everything (Food,appointment charges,meds etc). Told her all she needed to was rest and take care of her self and try to finish school.

It was going great until my GF started behaving really weirdly the sixth month. Her friend told me she regrets it and she wants to have some space etc. Though I again managed to convince her I'd always be there for her and for our child and let her have space.

This is happening again now - I've been trying to call her/text her and she never picks up my calls and delayed text replies, it feels like I'm talking to a wall. I'm incredibly concerned about her health both mental and physical and the health of our child. There hasn't been any response from her end though her friend did mention abortion.

My concerns keep on increasing like what if she wants an abortion, separates my child from me, do some stupid stuff because she's just 18 and I'm unsure how well she will/is dealing with this big of a responsibility. Is this normal in pregnancy? I seriously doubt it.


I will NOT let her kill my child at all no matter if that means I'd have to become a single dad. But I really want to reconcile with her because I do not want our child to have separate parents or a stepmother etc.

If anyone is wondering how i'll manage it financially I'll find a job right after undergraduation and continue programming too.

Heard horror stories about people losing their life savings?

Both are true. That's what makes crypto fascinating – and scary.

# The Hard Truth About Crypto Safety

**Here's what nobody wants to tell you:** In 2022, crypto thieves made off with $3.8 billion.

That's not a typo.

And it gets more interesting - 63% of Americans don't trust crypto's safety.

**But here's the thing:** Most people losing money in crypto aren't getting hacked.

They're making rookie mistakes.

# Why People Actually Lose Money in Crypto

**Let's break down the real dangers:**

# 1. Jumping in Too Deep, Too Fast

The biggest mistake?

Throwing rent money at crypto because some influencer said it's ""going to the moon.""

Starting with your life savings is like learning to swim by jumping into the ocean during a storm.

**Smart Move:** Start with what you can afford to lose. Period.

Most successful crypto investors recommend putting only 1-5% of your investment portfolio into crypto.

# 2. Falling for the FOMO Trap

""Bitcoin just hit an all-time high!"" ""This new coin is up 500%!""

That's exactly when most beginners jump in.

And that's exactly when they shouldn't.

# 3. Using Sketchy Exchanges

Not all crypto exchanges are created equal.

Some are like Fort Knox.

Others are like keeping your money in a cardboard box on the street.

# The No-BS Security Checklist for Beginners

Let's make this simple:

**Choose Trusted Exchanges**

* Stick to major platforms like Coinbase or Kraken
* Check if they have insurance against hacks
* Look for regulatory compliance

**Protect Your Account**

* Use a password manager
* Enable two-factor authentication
* Never share screen shots of your wallet

**Secure Your Crypto**

* Get a hardware wallet for large amounts
* Keep your recovery phrase offline
* Never store it on your phone or computer

# Real Talk: Starting Your Crypto Journey Safely

# Step 1: Start Small

Here's what worked for many successful crypto investors:

1. Set aside a small amount (think coffee money)
2. Pick one major cryptocurrency (Bitcoin or Ethereum)
3. Make your first purchase
4. Learn the ropes without the stress

# Step 2: Learn the Basics

Before throwing money at random coins:

* Understand blockchain basics
* Learn how wallets work
* Study market patterns
* Follow crypto news

# Step 3: Build Your Safety Net

Think of crypto security like building a fortress:

**Level 1: Basic Protection**

* Strong passwords
* 2FA on everything
* Separate email for crypto

**Level 2: Advanced Security**

* Hardware wallet
* Backup recovery phrases
* Regular security audits

# The Truth About Crypto Scams

Let's talk about what really happens out there:

* **Fake Exchanges** They look legit. They have great reviews. They're totally fake.
* **Pump and Dump Schemes** Someone famous promotes a coin. Price skyrockets. They sell, you lose.
* **Phishing Attacks** Fake emails from ""your exchange"" Fake support websites Fake everything

# When Is Crypto Actually Safe?

**Here's the reality check:**

Crypto becomes safer when you:

1. Know what you're doing
2. Use proper security
3. Invest responsibly
4. Stay updated on scams
5. Control your emotions

# Bottom Line: Is Crypto Right for You?

**Ask yourself:**

* Can I afford to lose this money?
* Am I patient enough to learn?
* Can I handle massive price swings?
* Do I understand basic security?

If you answered ""no"" to any of these, step back and learn more first.

# The Path Forward

Cryptocurrency isn't going anywhere.

But neither is the risk.

Success comes from:

* Starting small
* Learning constantly
* Staying vigilant
* Being patient

**Remember:** The safest crypto investors aren't the ones making headlines.

They're the ones quietly building wealth through knowledge, patience, and smart security practices.",1,1732012929.0,cliobra,0,1.0,False

(Here's my original post: [Quitting smoking today - my IFS-adjacent approach : r/InternalFamilySystems](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalFamilySystems/comments/1gtcjii/quitting_smoking_today_my_ifsadjacent_approach/))

I stopped smoking nearly 2 days ago – 48 hours is about exact. Objectively, here’s what happened.

1.      I primed myself with the responses (in the linked post) to the dialogs that initially rose up when I tried to stop prior. ""I want a cigarette."" ""One more pack – you’ll quit then."" ""I’m too stressed. I can’t do this right now."" ""You can’t do this. You’re too weak.""

2.      I smoked 3 cigarettes sitting on my back steps, then threw the empty pack away.

3.      I smoked about 15 cigarettes a day so every hour or so I got the urge. As I worked the urge came but there weren’t dialogs. Nothing compelled me to get another pack.

4.      I did have a trigger. The first time I walked past the door to the back steps a vision of smoking rose for a second and then disappeared. It was a picture, not a dialog.

5.      Maybe a half dozen times during the day I heard a resigned dialog say: “I wish I had a cigarette.” It wasn’t compelling – it was lamenting. It wasn’t even trying.

6.      As one poster said, nicotine can blunt caffeine metabolism, and withdrawal can increase the effect. I did feel extra wired from my usual coffee intake and found myself furiously cleaning.

7.      I had been up early and was wired but fatigued so I ended up taking a nap. After a sleep of 2 hours, I felt much better and less wired.

8.      My mind wasn’t particularly clear, as might have been expected, and I focused on working on tasks that didn’t take much mental effort. Organizing, making to do lists, etc.

9.      I allowed myself to overeat. It was a “planned fire” like when firemen will set a controlled fire as a fire break to stop an uncontrolled fire. I have a lot of experience in managing overeating – I know how to handle that. Cigarettes? I haven’t smoked in over a decade. No recent experience. I’ve used this ‘fire break’ approach before – using one negative behavior I have more skill in controlling as a temporary replacement for another negative behavior I have little skill at. I’ve found this playing of one against the other can be effective.

10.  I had stopped at one of the stores I go to for cigarettes to pick up milk and a Danish – part of my eating indulgence – and I noted in my head ‘this was where I bought cigarettes’ – but it was merely a cold objective acknowledgement and there was no emotive power behind it.

11.  At the beginning of day 2 I still felt a little out of sorts, with a mild headache and some brain fog, but nothing compelling me to smoke. Occasionally the resigned dialog would lament for a cigarette, but it was not distracting, loud or persistent.

12.  I got into my head a positive association: cigarettes were costing me about $10 a day. I could put that $10 toward my coin collecting hobby. I bought an old coin for $30. In my head, the reasoning went I needed to not smoke for two more days to pay for it. That is essentially a positive con done on myself – bribery. If I start smoking again, I’ve ‘lost’ $30.

13.  Less distracted, I did deeper work and was more productive than the prior day.

14.  I wanted to reclaim my back steps from the smoking habit and not allow them to be a trigger for smoking, so I sat out there twice with a cup of coffee to take in the sun and trees. I was fine.

15.  I overate again. I’m sure I’ve gained a good amount of weight, but I know what to do: just go back to my normal eating routine and the weight will go back down in a week or two – no big deal. I had wanted to live a little for Thanksgiving but I’m going to have to keep myself in check - but I’ll be ok.

16.  At the moment I feel fine – like I quit the habit and I’m done – but I do have some wariness. I know me well enough that I do need to keep a sense of self-awareness about this as this habit-break is still new and could be fragile – like a broken vase just glued back together, it might look almost good as new, but it needs time to set in place to gain structural integrity.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is all very interesting – but is it IFS? Here’s my attempt to look at it through the lens of IFS to see if I am understanding the framework:

1. Recognizing Dialogues and Parts

IFS Concept: In IFS, internal dialogues represent different ""parts"" of the self, such as:

Exiled Parts: Parts carrying pain, shame, or unmet needs (e.g., stress or anxiety driving smoking).

Manager Parts: Parts trying to maintain control and avoid discomfort (e.g., rationalizations like “I’m too stressed to quit”).

Firefighter Parts: Parts reacting to distress with impulsive behaviors (e.g., smoking or overeating to ""put out the fire"").

Your Example: You prepared responses to these internal voices before they arose, treating them as distinct entities. The lamenting dialog (“I wish I had a cigarette”) and the resigned dialog suggest you’re consciously interacting with your inner parts without letting them dominate.

2. Compassionate Curiosity Toward Parts

IFS Concept: IFS emphasizes approaching all parts with compassion, curiosity, and understanding rather than judgment.

Your Example: You observed your inner voices and triggers without hostility or resistance. For example:

Acknowledging the store as a trigger without emotional power.

Recognizing the resigned dialog as harmless lamentation rather than engaging with it.

Viewing overeating as a temporary ""fire break"" instead of a failure.

3. Rewriting Roles and Reclaiming Spaces

IFS Concept: IFS seeks to help parts take on healthier roles by transforming their function. For example:

A manager part that once encouraged smoking for stress relief might take on a new role as a planner for healthier habits.

A firefighter part that used to overeat or smoke might shift to supporting mindfulness or self-care behaviors.

Your Example: Reclaiming the back steps for coffee and nature is symbolic of this transformation. You rewrote the role of the space (and its trigger) into something positive and supportive of your goals.

4. Self-Led Action

IFS Concept: The ""Self"" in IFS is the core, compassionate, and calm leader of the internal system. Healing occurs when the Self leads rather than being dominated by reactive parts.

Your Example: Throughout this process, you acted from a Self-led perspective:

Preparing for dialogs in advance shows you’re not reacting impulsively but leading with intention.

Using overeating as a strategic choice, not an emotional reaction, reflects thoughtful leadership.

The metaphor of the fragile vase shows your Self’s awareness of the system’s fragility and the need for care.

5. Positive Bribery as Part Negotiation

IFS Concept: IFS uses ""negotiations"" with parts to meet their needs in healthier ways. For example:

A part craving cigarettes for pleasure or comfort might be redirected with the promise of another satisfying outlet (e.g., coin collecting).

Your Example: Framing the $30 coin as a reward reassigns the craving’s energy toward something positive. This is essentially a negotiation: ""If you resist the urge for cigarettes, you get this meaningful reward.""

6. Reassurance and Vigilance

IFS Concept: Early in habit change, parts that feel threatened (e.g., managers or firefighters tied to the old habit) may test the new system to see if it will hold. Maintaining awareness and compassion prevents them from taking over.

Your Example: Your wariness about the fragile state of the habit-break process reflects this IFS principle. Recognizing the need for time to ""set in place"" shows care for your system's structural integrity.",3,1732012370.0,InternalFamilySystems,1,0.81,False

1guu3b0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1guu3b0/shoplifting_food/,shoplifting food,"Hi,

Has anyone else had a history of shoplifting food to try to keep up with the costs of food needed to 'maintain' excessive binge/purge episodes. I am AN but subtype 2 and can go through a shit-ton of food daily. It became a compulsion for me to steal,, I'd say I am a kleptomaniac but it's also definitely a result of not having the funds to pay for my habits, i lose my head when I am in a supermarket and can't stop myself. Even if say I am standing in a coffee shop queue waiting to be served I can't stop myself from taking a sandwich and drink from the display and casually putting it in my bag.  
  
I have been caught numerous times which is always utterly humiliating but been let off a lot with warnings as they could see I was clearly ill, but have been in court once and in a police cell twice.  The police were always actually really kind to me, one time I was in there they kept trying to make me eat by bringing me cereal. By contrast the shop security and staff can treat you like dirt. Every time I got caught I'd become hysterical, at least till it became par for the course and I'd still for example walk out the door with something fully knowing I was being watched,  like some kind of self punishment thing.  I also have stolen non food items so it def became some kind of addiction.  They tell me I have 'impulse control disorder' as also struggle with drug use and other reckless compulsive behaviours. I do everything to the extreme and run to red flags like a bull.

I am deeply ashamed of it and it's a part of me I really despise as I am not a selfish person and I do it not for personal gain but because of desperation. But basically I live in a small town so it's awful, I am now banned from every supermarkets around here (4 main ones) and everyone gossips about everything around here. I have to rely on online shopping now which tbh helps me/keeps me safe but is a palavar sometimes, and if I go elsewhere to like a new supermarket I find it incredibly hard, especially with self serve checkouts.. I was absolutely out of control though, used to literally walk out of the store with a trolley full of foods and act like I'd paid for it, I got away with like thousands I reckon, not something I am proud of in the slightest.

I know from other online support forums and such that it is a lot more common than people know. I guess it's another grim dirty aspect of ED that nobody wants to talk about. So yeah I was wondering if anyone else here can relate?",5,1732011875.0,EDAnonymous,1,0.86,False
