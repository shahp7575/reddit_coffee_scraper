1gdml7n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdml7n,wow omg we went on a really nice long date technically,"As a sort of late birthday celebration Leon and I went to Las Vegas. I didn‚Äôt gamble all that much, we went more for the sights and (for myself) the shopping.


We did see the Cirque Du Soleil(I sure hope I spelled that correctly) which is something I never thought I‚Äôd see, but it was really cool. There was a very cool art exhibit as you walked in which I thought was very cool. Its focus was on the body and movement.


We also went to Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Gordon‚Äôs fish and chips. I‚Äôm a massive fan of Gordon Ramsay and I‚Äôve had the grand pleasure of introducing Leon to a lot of his shows by this point lol We got to try the signature foods from the show, and while we did eat a lot of steak this week(much to someone‚Äôs pleasure) this was probably the best one. We finished it off with a dessert(they topped it with a birthday candle) and some coffee(since that‚Äôs our thing) Honestly everything we ate here was fantastic, this was no doubt the best place we ate at this trip.


While we were lost for a bit in Caesar‚Äôs Palace I spotted an elevator door with Marcus Aurelius on it, which I thought was cool. Not too long ago I read Meditations. It started out as a by myself thing and eventually I started reading it out to Leon as well. I think we both really benefitted from it.


We also went to a little exhibit thing in the Luxor about King Tutankhamen which was really educational. I‚Äôm a big Egypt connoisseur but i still learned a few things I didn‚Äôt know. We saw a calcite cup depicting the god ‚ÄúHeh‚Äù which we both thought was really funny. We also got lost in the Luxor(I swear I‚Äôm not bad at directions) but because of that we got to see the sphinx up close and honestly it‚Äôs amazing how big it is up close.


Overall a really great trip, we had a great time. Also the cr√®me br√ªl√©e in the first picture was amazing, it‚Äôs my favorite dessert so I had to try it.",1,1730066790.0,waifuism,0,1.0,False

I went on a casual daytime coffee date with this guy that my family friend tried to set me up with. I was genuinely excited.

1gdmi8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1gdmi8h/i_hid_under_the_desk_today/,I hid under the desk today,"Sundays are my Monday and I came into a busy one today. We were sold out last night so I hit the ground running this morning. A ""[guest](https://redd.it/1fhgl4g)"" I've complained about [before](https://redd.it/1fshoo4) almost immediately came to talk at me, which is an absolutely terrible way to start a day. I'm barely awake and the back door comes flying open and I hear ""HEY BRAN"" and then a bunch of noise after that. My brain has become so accustomed to her voice that it just filters out most everything she says because none of it matters anyway. 

Also, it turns out she lied about the manager giving her permission to stay overnight in the parking lot. She told me she had the manager's permission, and told the manager she had the owner's permission, and the owner vaguely recalled telling her it was okay for one night but had made no promises beyond that. She was told she could no longer stay overnight as we'd gotten complaints, but she was not told that I was the one who complained. In discussions with the manager and the rest of the desk staff I learned that literally everyone except one night auditor is absolutely sick of her being around. But I guess we all feel too bad to refuse her service just because she's annoying. Or maybe none of us want to be the one to have to tell her and her creepy son to get lost.

Anyway, so she was bothering me this morning while I handled coffee and breakfast and checkouts. She finally left when I had to retreat to the back to deal with a spare coffee pot that someone left coffee in for who knows how long. I wish I knew who put it away so I could slap them. It was vile.

Around 11am two guests, a man and a woman, came up wanting to move from a room with a king bed to a room with two beds. Us having been sold out last night and housekeeping still early in their day, all I had with two beds was on the second floor but they didn't want that. They asked when one might be ready, I told them I couldn't guarantee anything before 3pm. They asked for a 12pm c/o which I gave them.

I kept busy for the next hour with barely any time to think. Shortly after 12 they came back up and asked again about a first floor double. I still didn't have one, I told them again I couldn't guarantee anything before 3pm. They asked if there was a laundromat in the area, there is and I explained how to get there. Then the woman got angry at me because she thought we had laundry on site. We do, but considering that wasn't what she asked, and they were checking out, I didn't think that's what she was asking about. So I told her where on the property the laundry room is. They checked out, and a little while later the man came back saying he couldn't find it, so I had to direct him to it again.

Around 12:30 I finally had a moment to make myself a cup of coffee and felt a little better. I messaged the GM about something unrelated and she asked about the folks were looking for a ground floor double. She'd had to help them the previous day because they couldn't figure out how to operate their shower or microwave.

About an hour later, the man came back to the desk frustrated because the dryer ate a bunch of his quarters. Now, the dryers we have are in fact pieces of garbage and so is the company that is supposed to maintain them. They are constantly breaking (one was already out) and the company's usual method of fixing them is taking the quarters out and removing our out of order sign without actually checking what is wrong with the machine. We're actually having them removed on Wednesday and installing our own machines because it's been such a headache. I refunded the man the almost $5 in quarters he'd put in the machine and did not bother to ask him why he put so much in when it only costs $2 because of the rest of our interactions at that point. He also asked again about a ground floor double, and I still didn't have one that I knew of. The head housekeeper had been busy af too so I hadn't gotten an update on what was available yet.

After the man left I went up to the laundry room to put an out of order sign on the dryer that ate his quarters. As I went to put it up, I realized that the coin return slot was just packed with quarters in a ""well there's your problem"" moment. I didn't have anything on me to try to fix it with, so I went back to the desk to find some tools I could try to use to retrieve the quarters and avoid the headache of listening to guests being rightfully upset at both dryers being out. 

When I got back to the desk a regular guest was waiting for me. Unfortunately, he is an energy vampire like the lying homeless woman. I tried to get him checked in, but he really wanted to spend a half an hour talking about how he drove here instead of flying, road work, weather, and how he can't find the chips he likes in stores anymore. Also, he told me about his adventures in trying to find the chips last time he was here too and it wasn't interesting the first time either. My various attempts to exit the conversation failed because he does not pause to breathe and does not allow me to get more than a word in edgewise. And I do realize the irony in complaining about longwinded people in a longwinded reddit post, but the difference is that no one is keeping you here against your will! You can leave at any time!

Once that was done I finally managed to get back up to the laundry room. I was able to get a couple dollars in quarters out, but not all of them so I wasn't able to get the machine back up and running myself. When I returned to the desk, now the culprit was waiting for me and asked for directions to the laundromat again because he couldn't find it the first time. He also asked again about the ground floor room, but between the various other things I'd had to deal with, I still hadn't had a chance to touch base with the head housekeeper.

During this interaction the chatty homeless woman swung by again to use the bathroom. After the laundry man walked away I heard the toilet flush in the bathroom and knew the woman would be coming out in a second so I literally ducked under the desk where she couldn't see me in the hopes that it would save me from then having to have a ""conversation"" with her. And it worked! She didn't come to the desk. I was finally able to get some more work done and breathe for a bit. The guy came and got his ground floor double and stopped bothering me too so that was nice.

The head housekeeper came by to update me on what was ready, tell me about what rooms were being blocked and why when another guest came to the desk looking confused. He asked why his room hadn't been serviced today. I apologized and asked who he'd requested service from, and the answer was no one. He'd apparently not been paying attention when he checked in the night before when he was told that service is available only by request. He looked absolutely dumbfounded, and asked if people really use sheets and towels more than once without changing them? I said yes, I think that's pretty common. He asked for service, but we require service requests to be in by 11am so housekeeping can plan accordingly. We're not super strict on that but at this point it was 4pm and housekeeping had a ton of work to do so the head housekeeper offered him fresh towels and sheets but said we couldn't do full service. He wasn't happy but it was no one's fault but his that he wasn't paying attention at check in. Also, I recognized him as someone who has stayed with us before so none of this should have been new to him anyway.

It's 6pm and housekeeping is just finally getting done, I haven't seen either of my aural assailants in a bit, maybe the last two hours of my shift will go quietly. Except they won't now that I said that.",0,1730066557.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,0.5,False

I hate to admit it but I know it‚Äôs more than just because of the coffee.

Had I known our paths were gonna cross at the coffee shop earlier/last night I might‚Äôve as well just didn‚Äôt get a cup. Because you are more than enough to keep me woke.

I was only meaning to order a frappe instead of my usual hot beverage takeout because I needed an instant kicker for the drive way home. Then you  suddenly showed up as if a miracle happened right in front of me.

You saw me first and you poked me to get my attention. Voila! My heart were skipping beats and hands trembling, cold and clammy ‚Äî literally. Just so you know.

Then you smiled at me just like how you did from our previous encounters and asked me who I was with.

You‚Äôre the same and your approach still the same like how you used to. How you used to before things went downhill for us.

You are the same and thank you for that alone.

In one hand I was quite relieved the moment I realized you were wearing your sweet smile still in spite of what happened to us. Yet in another I was preoccupied. I was and still am preoccupied that it is just going to be another memory of you stored in my head with the rest like montage I‚Äôll keep revisiting ‚Äòtil I hurt myself to the thoughts of you.

And as I was driving my way home my thoughts were all over the encounter. I was all over you again. But don‚Äôt get me wrong, it just felt so surreal to me. Like it always does every damn time.

I was only taken aback..in a good way..I think..

I missed you so much I wanted to snatch you for a hug. But it is just wrong aside from it is forbidden. And oh how I also missed your voice.

So I guess I‚Äôll just continue to puff things off of my red sticks. It‚Äôs my only relief.

1gdmf7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AffectionateDot9698/comments/1gdmf7x/why_do_i_still_miss_her/,Why do I still miss her?,"It was September 2021 when I first chatted with her on Discord. Eventually, we became friends and started chatting daily.

Nothing serious‚Äîjust about our daily lives. She often told me how burned out she was from the excessive workload at Kota and how hectic her life had become. I always tried my best to cheer her up. I never asked her for a photo (her Instagram didn‚Äôt have any pictures; we used it just to chat), and I never talked about anything remotely sexual.

She never told me her name, and I never asked, as she was super shy and introverted. I enjoyed chatting with her. Over time, I opened up to her about some serious issues in my life. She was kind enough not to judge me, and we remained friends.

She was the first stranger I had ever opened up to, and talking to her made me feel a way I can't describe. She introduced me to Anuv Jain and Prateek Kuhad‚Äîbasically, indie music in general. I was three years older than her, but due to personal issues, I couldn‚Äôt focus on my studies. I poured my heart out to her, telling her everything about myself. This was unlike me, as I was a shy, introverted kid who never opened up to anyone. For the first time in my life, I felt like I had someone I could talk to.

One day, she told me it was Poonam and suggested I look at the moon and make a wish. I remember going up to my terrace, gazing at the moon, and smiling like an idiot. I had never seen her or heard her voice, but something about her always made me feel good whenever we talked. After every conversation, I would sit there thinking about her and feeling oddly happy.

Eventually, she deleted Discord, so she shared her phone number and Instagram, and we started chatting there occasionally.

Amidst all of this, one day I was feeling really down and told her about it. For the first time, she asked me to call her. And that was when I heard her voice for the first‚Äîand last‚Äîtime.

I don‚Äôt know how, but I developed feelings for her. I wanted to meet her in person, just for a coffee and to spend a little time together. Just as a friend. But I never had the courage to tell her that I had started liking her, even though I barely knew her or had ever seen her.

At that point, I wasn‚Äôt serious about my career and had almost given up on my studies. I feel that, in some way, this must have bothered her. She began ignoring me and eventually ghosted me without any explanation. Maybe I was just a loser, not adding anything meaningful to her life.

The last thing she told me was, ‚ÄúMy results are coming.‚Äù And that was it‚Äîwe never spoke again.

Even though it lasted only 10 months, I remember every single day. I used to wait for her text every night, no matter how small the conversation might be. Even if it was just a quick ‚Äúhru‚Äù or a short ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I eagerly waited for her messages. I hated that she ghosted me, and I couldn‚Äôt get over it. And she didn‚Äôt even tell me her result.

I had that one call recording, and I deleted it. And today, I realized I‚Äôve forgotten how her voice sounded. I was about to send her a ‚Äúhi‚Äù on WhatsApp, but that would be super creepy üò≠üò≠.

The truth is, I don‚Äôt hold any place in her life, and she probably never cared about me in the first place. And I hate the fact that I still remember her and want to talk to her again after all that ghosting.

Am I a creep? Am I a bad person for feeling this way? Or am I just really lonely? I don‚Äôt know.

How do I forget that she exists and move on? I feel bad for spending so much time with her because I know she‚Äôll never come back into my life. I have nothing to offer, and even now, I‚Äôm still struggling with my career. I don‚Äôt even have the courage to send her a simple ‚Äúhi‚Äù on her number. Maybe she‚Äôs in a good college now, surrounded by lots of friends, and has completely forgotten about me‚Äîor maybe I wasn‚Äôt that important to her in the first place.

Sometimes I feel like talking to her, but I don‚Äôt have the courage. Or maybe it would just be humiliating if I messaged her after she ghosted me so badly. Or maybe I‚Äôm just an idiot for developing feelings for a random girl from far away‚Äîsomeone I‚Äôve never even met.

Uhh, I just remembered her, so I decided to post this. I don‚Äôt really want to talk about it, but I needed to say it to someone.

Reminders/notes don't work: I forget to check, if I turn on pop ups it's the same as the alarms.

Last winter when I last tried to quit I got so depressed and anxious for several months I was prescribed an SSRI that I'm still on. So maybe I'll be spared of that this attempt.

Could anyone who has successfully quit smoking on medication share some experiences? Did you have to stop the medication while you stopped to smoke? Or did it help you?

1gdmast,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gdmast/aio_or_am_i_justified_for_going_back_to_an_old/,AIO or am I justified for going back to an old lady and telling her I didn‚Äôt do what she thought I did and that it wasn‚Äôt nice to call me an idiot ,"I was trying to go into the train station parking garage at a pretty busy area and they had put a sign in front saying it was closed. Everyone in front of me was doing K turns, because this truck was blocking the entrance with an old lady coming out telling people to turn around. With everyone in front of me turning around I went into this ‚Äúemployees only‚Äù lane that was only about 25 feet long so that I could turn around her truck instead of stopping and being in the way by doing another K turn. The lady comes out of the truck and goes in front of my car and starts freaking out on me yelling at me saying it‚Äôs closed. I calmly tell her I know it‚Äôs closed I‚Äôm just trying to turn around. And she continues to berate me, and tell me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you see it‚Äôs a do not enter‚Äù , I told her it wasn‚Äôt a do not enter. And then she kept yelling at me and eventually called me an idiot. After she got out of the way I turned around like I had intended.

Flash forward 3 hours I get out of a movie and I‚Äôm walking around realizing that I‚Äôm near the parking lot again. So I go back and would you know it, she‚Äôs standing out front still but now she‚Äôs letting cars in. I even went to the lane I went in before and took a picture to prove it did not say do not enter. And went up to her and asked if she remembered me, and that she called me an idiot earlier for going down a do not enter and said she should really go look. And that it was pretty immature to act that way. I even said sure I made a mistake for going that way, because obviously she had wanted everyone to do k turns, but you shouldn‚Äôt be yelling at people and calling them idiots for a mistake. And she kept going at me saying I was butthurt, and that I was a child, and that I was an idiot again. And then the car she was holding up rolled his windows down and started telling me to take a walk. 

Am I overreacting or like am I in the wrong? I liken it to if you ordered at a coffee shop and you accidentally order the wrong thing and when it comes out you say, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to order that, and the cashier calls you an idiot for doing that. I don‚Äôt know if she thought for some reason I was trying to drive past her or something when I was parking but I obviously knew I had to turn around and I thought it was obvious that I was trying to do that. Maybe it was petty to go back to her but I hate people telling me I‚Äôm wrong when I know I‚Äôm not. It did not say do not enter. And I felt for someone as old as she was and do be the one who‚Äôs working for the state she should be a little less abrasive to someone trying to park.

TL:DR
Some old lady yelled at me and called me an idiot for going down a lane to turn around at a parking garage. I went back to her and told her it wasn‚Äôt a do not enter and she shouldn‚Äôt call me an idiot.  ",1,1730065994.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I've been in therapy for a couple years now. We started talking about how my parents affected my relationships as a cishet dating men. 

I'm not sure what attachment I may have‚Äîim going with chaotic/disorganized for being both anxious and avoidant. Both profiles seem to fit based on context.

I randomly have been thinking about this guy I dated 5 years‚Äîlikely since it's partially my fault the connection died. But the kicker is we only went on 4 dates. I found him handsome, he seemed interested after matching on Bumble, he had big life goals he was working towards. He seemed like my ideal guy for a ltr. He asked me out within 3 days and which was way different from the pen pals I was used to.

At this time, I was working as a CNA, him at a coffee shop while job searching after he just came home from his out of state college in California.

We had good chemistry and conversation flow e nicely. Granted now that I look back I don't think Made the best impression as I spoke about my CNA work over dinner with some graphic situations lol and also brought up some family trauma when asked about parents and siblings. It lasted.3 weeks.

One day, I noticed he posted on Instagram stories but didn't respond to my texts from the day before. I got viscerally offended and unfollowed him from Twitter before I remembered the mute button ü•¥ I hoped he didn't notice because I reached out again hoping I might've been wrong about my interpretation. Also I noticed the texts slowed after date 4, hr mentioned date 5 but didn't schedule. I wondered if it's because I didn't let him come over. I felt it was too early to be at each other's place for any reason and didn't want to have to reject any advances just in case.

But now I looked him up to see where he ended up. He has a nice corporate job that could be well paying, still handsome, ive been thinking about how this couldve played out but this is where I think my attachment issues are most apparent in my dating life aside from a guy from 10 years ago‚Äîtgay door is closed but I still have some resentment as he's still on my block list unbeknownst to him, guy 2. Low-key I think I should've communicated better.rather than what I call light or diet ghosting. Is it wrong for a man to be sexually attracted to me so early? I was still s virgin at this time we might've been incompatible.

1gdm6yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1gdm6yt/ayurvedic_gerd_cure/,Ayurvedic GERD cure ,"This is a long, detailed post. It outlines how I, male late 20s / early 30s, overcame GERD (following clinical diagnosis) in 15 months. The cures outlined are derived from traditional Indian / Ayurvedic medicine and studies (my research indicated that western medicine only treats symptoms, not the underlying cause). Good luck to everyone, wish you lots of healing. I am not a doctor so please consult with a professional as needed. I found a lot of good info on Reddit and want to pass it forward. 

Given GERD results from weakening of lower esophagus sphincter, the cure focused on giving time for the sphincter to heal by 1) quoting the area with protective items (eg cow ghee) 2) reducing acid production in the stomach by eliminating acidic foods and 3) doing yoga to heal the impacted area. 

Causes of my GERD were likely stress and excess spice. I was diagnosed by gastroenterologists (multiple) and told I would be on meds for the rest of my life, which I refused to believe. I spent hours studying natural cures and speaking to doctors around the world, and have summarized in the post below. 

Summary 
1. Hot water with organic cow ghee every morning (empty stomach) and night (last thing before going to bed) 
2. Homeopathic medicine three times a day, as prescribed by homeopath 
3. Fresh organic red cabbage and carrot juice every morning for 3 months. Juiced myself. 
4. Significant shift in diet, led to weight loss. Quit alcohol. Detail below. 
5. Smaller meals, equal to 1 cup or less 
6. Yoga every morning focused on stomach strengthening and digestive poses 
7. Sleeping on incline mattress, at least 2-3 hours after eating 
8. Lot of meditation and focusing energy on digestive tract and stomach 
9. Chew food properly. Don‚Äôt need to overdo it but I used to inhale food prior to my diagnosis. This was not good. 

Natural meds / other meds  
- Homeopathy - Ayurvedic medicine that are used to cure a variety of diseases. Homeopathic medicine are made of natural ingredients (plants, roots, herbs, etc) and are consumed either in liquid or solid form. Please find a naturopath or homeopath near you - there are tons of homeopathic medicines designed to treat GERD and the medicine prescribed will depend on your specific symptoms, age, etc. I took daily for 15 months. 
- Deglycerolized licorice root: took before most meals, helps quote stomach to protect from acidity. Available on Amazon and completely natural. I used DGL whenever I got acidity, it helped soothe things. 
- Gaviscon if acidity got bad
- I did NOT use any Omeprazole / anti acid as once you start this, it is very difficult to get off. All my western doctors pushed me towards anti-acids but I refused after researching online. 

Morning routine 
- On empty stomach, have hot water (50 ml) with organic Cow ghee (clarified  butter) (quarter tea spoon) mixed into it (took with Manuka honey to help with flavor). I boiled water and added ghee to let it mix in. This helps quote your esophagus and protects it from reflux for the day. VERY important. I did this every day. 
- Then 20 mins later, freshly juiced red cabbage and carrot juice - red cabbage has shown to help with GERD and carrot is to help with flavor. I did this every day for the first 3 months. 
- Then in the morning, yoga stomach strengthening / clearing poses (help a lot if you do regularly). You can find these on YouTube. I did this every day and continue to - you will need to find exercises that work for you. 
- My typical breakfast was two boiled eggs (no yolk) 

Throughout the day 
- Sip hot water throughout the day, will help a lot in managing reflux. When you have reflux, your body is producing a lot of acid and as a result, excess heat. Pouring cold water / drink on it is harmful (think of how a hot pan sizzles if you pour cold water on it). Hot water will make you feel better. 
- Eat small meals. Each meal (liquid + solids) should be less than the size of a cup. 
- No water before or after eating for 45 minutes. Water mixes with food and comes up as acidity. Even now, I don‚Äôt drink water for up to 2 hours after eating. 
- My typical lunch was grilled wild caught salmon with organic grilled veggies. Olive oil and salt for seasoning. 
- For snack, I would have organic plain Greek yogurt mixed with pure Manuka honey (can find on Amazon, Manuka honey helps with digestive trac). I would also have this if I was feeling burning in my chest. 

In the night 
- Drink hot water with organic cow ghee (quarter tea spoon) as last item at night. This will protect your esophagus from acidity overnight. VERY important. 
- Eat 2-3 hours before sleeping 
- Sleep on an incline matters. Can buy a mattress incliner from Amazon - this is very helpful and ensures acid formed overnight stays in your stomach. I bought a 7 inch incliner from Amazon. 
- My typical dinner was grilled seafood or freshly made vegetable soup (made myself) with toast and olive oil and fresh cheeses 

Things I ate - ate different combinations (cooked, raw, grilled) of the below. Did NOT deviate at all. All organic / wild caught. I was obviously not getting enough calories / lost muscle but this was a sacrifice I was willing to make. 
- Seafood - Salmon, Shrimp, mussels, etc 
- Eggs
- White rice 
- Whole wheat bread
- Ginger 
- Vegetables - I was generally ok with all veggies except ones that are acidic like onion garlic tomato 
- Cheese
- Olive oil 
- Avocado oil 
- Salt 
- Oregano
- Basil 
- Parsley 
- Fruits (found banana causes reflux but apple worked well)
- NO alcohol - I quit drinking 

Diet timeline 
- First 8 months, I strictly followed the above diet. Did not deviate at all (potentially once a month but wouldn‚Äôt feel great). Lost 15 pounds. 
- After 8 months, I started deviating from the above diet once a week to reintroduce foods 
- After 15 months, I am now eating everything, but limit coffee to once a week. I still sip hot water throughout the day and have cow ghee with water whenever I get acidity. Symptoms come once in a while if I overeat. 
- I always wait 2.5 hours after eating before going to bed. I think this is one of the most important things to do. 

Exercises / meditation 
- Yoga as mentioned above 
- Meditation. Focusing your energy on your esophagus / sphincter. 
- I stopped lifting weights for the first 8 months as working out squeezes your stomach and acid comes up. I am now lifting and running again. 

Progression
- First 5 months were tough. I was getting acid reflux after eating. I had a lot of hot water to manage this. Meditation helped a lot
- After 6 months, I started noticing improvements. Continued following diet. 
- 9 months later, my doctor ordered an endoscopy. Came back completely normal. 
- In month 10, my homeopath advised that I continue with homeopathy but gradually return to a more normal diet 
- Now in month 15, I am eating everything but still no alcohol. I continue doing yoga exercises and keep up with the meditation. 

Overcoming GERD is possible. I am sure there are multiple ways to do it and I am describing one. Good luck and hope this helps.

My grand-grandfather was telling about some of his memories from when he fought in the war. He showed me two pictures, one with many soldiers and one with him and another guy. It's amazing to see how someone that you grew up believing that he was always old, how he looked when he was young. And I saw that he looks like me and like my father.

The other guy was another soldier. He told me some stories with him. He didn't use the words love, people at his age won't use those words. You won't find any of the modern terms in his vocabulary. But it was clear that he loved him. He described me that they spent a couple of days in the mountains alone and where he had hidden him because he would get executed by the Germans. There was obviously nothing intimate, or at least he didn't describe it.

That got me thinking. Many people make friends today because they drink a coffee together and say this is friendship. They take a photo together and uploaded it. But people like my grand-grandfather risked their lives to help their friends. They've been through hell to survive. Did that kind of friendship feel the same as today? Where they bromances back then? My ggrandfather told me that at some point he was shot and his friend was helping him, cleaning his wound, carrying him and sleeping on the floor next to him. For a gay guy, that could be the closest he ever got in his life to another man.

My wife and I are currently living in the Minneapolis metro area, but we‚Äôre considering a move to be closer to her family. Her dad‚Äôs battling cancer, and she‚Äôs been feeling the pull to be nearer to him. Her parents live in Utah, not far from Salt Lake City, so we‚Äôre hoping to find a place within reasonable driving distance (up to 8-10 hours by car) or a short flight away.

A bit about us:

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre a married lesbian couple in our mid-30s (35 and 36).
	‚Ä¢	I work remotely, so I can be flexible with location, but my wife is an oncology nurse specializing in infusion chemotherapy and IV treatments, so a solid healthcare job market is essential.
	‚Ä¢	We have two doodles we love taking outdoors‚Äîdog-friendly parks, patios, and trails are a must!
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre social and love meeting new people! We enjoy hosting, going out to dinner, catching games or concerts, and we‚Äôd be up for joining local clubs or groups to make connections.

Current housing setup:

	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre in a 1bd + den apartment (about 1,080 sq. ft.) paying around $2,300/month. We‚Äôre open to flexing up to about $2,500, and could stretch to $2,700-2,800 if it‚Äôs perfect.
	‚Ä¢	We have two cars, so parking is important!

What we‚Äôre looking for in a new community:

	‚Ä¢	LGBTQ+ acceptance and safety: We‚Äôre hoping for a place with a vibrant LGBTQ community or at least a tolerant, accepting vibe. Feeling safe is our #1 priority.
	‚Ä¢	General safety: We currently feel comfortable taking our dogs out at night, so finding a similarly safe area would be ideal.
	‚Ä¢	A lively, fun scene: Farmers markets, festivals, museums, parks, shopping‚Äîanything that keeps a town buzzing is a big plus.
	‚Ä¢	A strong food scene: Minneapolis has spoiled us with great restaurants, and we‚Äôd love to be somewhere with a good variety of food spots and coffee shops to explore.
	‚Ä¢	Pro sports teams: We‚Äôre big sports fans, so any city with local teams gets extra points!

We‚Äôre aware of the political climate in some mountain west/southwest areas, so we‚Äôre trying to be mindful. We want to balance finding a welcoming environment with staying close to family.

\--

I was sitting on the Moominhouse's living room couch, drinking the hot coffee that Moominmamma had just made for us. The coffee tasted strong, but good. I watched Moominpappa squint intently at the newspaper. Snufkin was sitting next to me on the couch, slurping his coffee while looking absent-minded. Moominmamma had returned to her chores. It was a normal day in Moominvalley, at least until two tiny guests arrived at the house, who were acting very suspicious. They had introduced themselves as Thingumy and Bob, and after enjoying dinner with us, they merely thanked and locked themselves in the upstairs guestroom.

Moominpappa had been especially cautious around the newcomers, whereas Moomintroll had been trying to get them to come play with him. Those two were nonetheless rather antisocial, and they also seemed rather timid, and didn't want to come along. I drank the rest of my coffee and wondered why those strangers had come to stay at the Moominhouse in the first place if they were mostly going to stay in their room and only come out to eat. I got up from the couch and took my cup to the kitchen, where Moominmamma gave me her sweet smile and continued with the huge pile of dishes. The sky started becoming dimmer, and I noticed that the clock was already nearing eight. I had been entirely focused on the newspaper, which I had started reading after Moominpappa was finished reading it. I noticed that the house was full of life once again since Moomintroll and Sniff had returned to the Moominhouse. Little My and Snorkmaiden, on the other hand, had gone to their homes, so Moominmamma had unknowingly made a bigger batch of rice pudding than usual. I gratefully took a serving and ate with a good appetite. At the table, in addition to me, were Moomintroll, Sniff, Moominpappa and Snufkin, while Moominmamma was cleaning the kitchen stove. The guests hadn't been heard from at all in a while, until I heard running in the staircase.

Thingumy and Bob came to us looking panic-stricken, which Moominpappa also noticed. They only ate a little of the rice pudding that Moominmamma offered and were about to return upstairs immediately after, until Moominpappa stopped them and asked why they were so nervous and spent most of their time by themselves. One of the guests, Thingumy, looked questioningly at his friend Bob, swallowed and started an explanation that didn't make any sense, but whose contents were so frightening that it forcefully alarmed me.

Thingumy told that he and Bob were being followed by some big, hill-shaped thing that always appeared when they were about to go to sleep. They called this creature ""the Groke"", and their explanation of it was so confusing and distressing that I couldn't understand it quite fully. They said that the thing always seemed to appear behind them, and that it would kill anyone who looked into its eyes. They explained that their mother had talked about ""the Groke"" a couple days before her death, after which the creature had started appearing near them as well, and because of this, they had left their house and fled elsewhere in the hopes that the monster would not follow them. But now they were sure that ""the Groke"" would come to them tonight as well.

Moominpappa tried to ask more about this ""Groke"", but the answers were quite strange and confusing. Thus, he looked like he thought the guests were insane, and whispered something into Moominmamma's ear. Moomintroll and Snufkin also clearly did not believe what they had heard. Sniff was the only one besides me who seemed really upset. Although he kept repeating that the guests were lying in order to scare us and that there are no such things as Grokes, I could see the fear shining in his eyes. Though I was also a little terrified by what the guests had told us, I still aimed to think logically, and finally, I said that the guests were likely paranoid or perhaps otherwise psychotic. My theory got strengthened when the guests proceeded to hand out pills.

Bob handed everyone a pill and said that they would help us fall asleep. Moominpappa and Moominmamma were shocked, immediately grabbed the pills from the table and threw them in the oven. They also seized the duo's three pill bottles and threw them into the fire as well. After this, the guests went completely berserk and started yelling things like ""We can never sleep again!"" and ""You killed us all!"", and then Moominpappa signaled me, Moomintroll and Snufkin to help. We gagged and tied them up into chairs since we couldn't take that mad screaming and hysteria anymore.

Moominpappa decided that the next day, we would report those two to the police, and suspected them to be either insane or drug addicts. Moominmamma was upset by the situation and went to make evening tea. Snufkin prepared to leave for his tent. I looked at the clock and saw that it was already half past eleven. I glanced out the window and noticed that it was pitch black. I also felt a strange loneliness and cold within me, so I gladly proceeded to enjoy Moominmamma's warm tea whose warmth made me feel a bit better. Snufkin wished us good night and stepped outside, and I watched his outlines slowly fade into the night.

Sniff, like I, also decided to stay the night at the house. So, Moominmamma went upstairs and changed the bedsheets in Thingumy and Bob's room on the bed on which Sniff got to sleep. I myself had already slept one night in another guestroom that was also upstairs. Moominpappa and Moominmamma slowly retreated into their own bedroom, and Thingumy and Bob were inhospitably left tied into the chairs in the living room where we nonetheless lit a candle to bring some light. Moomintroll looked at the mysterious duo, looking a little frustrated, and for a moment, he looked just like his father. I wondered what was going on in his head right now, so I asked what he thought about Thingumy and Bob, and most importantly, ""the Groke"".

Moomintroll wondered if a logical person like me could believe in fantasy creatures and stated that he was sure those two had used so much drugs that they had permanently damaged their noggins and were now seeing grokes everywhere. I said that I somewhat agreed with him, wished him good night and watched him also get in his room and close the door. Then I marched into my guestroom, blew out the candle providing light, and laid down. ""There aren't any grokes"", I thought, and closed my eyes. Silence filled the house.

I remember waking up to a terrible coldness at some point. I set the blanket tighter around me and tried to fall asleep again. However, the blanket didn't help at all, because the cold reached my bones and guts. I changed my position and my heart skipped a beat when I noticed the door to my room was ajar. I was fully sure that I had closed it as I was going to sleep. Wild thoughts filled my mind, but I still got up to close the door. I thought that I had just forgotten to lock the door and was going to go back to bed, until the silence was broken by a noise that made my blood freeze.

I can't possibly describe that noise, because it was so low, croaky and inhuman-sounding that the human ear shouldn't even be able to comprehend such sounds. It sounded moaning and threatening at the same time. I couldn't make out words, but the noise filled me with the kind of fear I had never felt before. It sounded like it was coming from downstairs, so I closed the door and immediately rushed towards my bed. However, I didn't notice my blanket laying on the floor, which I tripped over, and in that instant, my world darkened.",1,1730065295.0,Moomins,0,1.0,False

As the title suggests, can we develop a web application for digital signage using no code platform?

The idea is to allow users (such as coffee shop owners, restaurants, etc.) to upload and manage their content (e.g., offers, menus) and display it on their screens.

Is this feasible with no code platform? If so, what are your thoughts on the platform's capacity? How many users could it handle, and how many screens could be managed effectively?

So, where should the couch go? I included pictures of a couple of ideas I had for where to put the bookshelf and included the dimensions of each wall (note: I'm not getting cable, so the TV doesn't have to go against the wall with the cable outlet).

Sorry if the title sounds weird I just need genuine and UNBIASED advice either way.

I, 23, have been married for around 2 years to my, 35, husband. He is a generous man, he pays for the rent and all our food and we went to turkey on holiday together from him. Additionally, maybe once or sometimes twice a week, we get a coffee on him too.

When I had my own money I could also supplement if I wanted to, but since I had our first child this spring I have been unable to work and do not get maternity leave payment. As a result I have no money and am in my overdraft due to paying for my tuition too. When I found out I was pregnant I asked my husband if I should drop out and defer school but he said no he will support me. But I don't have the money to pay tuition as my savings now ran out. So I have had to beg him for over a month whilst getting the tuition letters demanding payment or expulsion.

He gave me the money (¬£400 only as I have a scholarship so not the full amount) and then said I will need to pay him back half and the other half is my weekly (usually about ¬£5-10) coffee/ personal money.

I feel like a beggar but when my parents heard one of our conversations about this they got angry. They didn't say anything to him but told me they would start giving me money as it upset them to see me like that. For context, I am a revert and my parents are British, and there are some misunderstandings about the relationship between me and my husband. Also, I know my parents will have their own different morals, but my dad and mum shared an account and when my mum stayed at home for 10 years and didn't work when raising me and my brother, they told me she didn't have to ask for money as it was 'their' money.

I realised how upset it has been making me feel. It's actually not even about money. I am not an ungrateful person who asks and expects to be given something for nothing. I like working. I just can't right now as my daughter is so so young, too young for childcare. I am trying to find online work like tutoring but we have been moving around a lot and I haven't made a successful application as most of my work experience is in a different field.

I hate feeling like a beggar and asking for money. But am I being reasonable? I know Islamically my husband fulfils ALL his requirements of house and food. So maybe I am being ungrateful?

I actually want criticism and advice if you feel I deserve either one, please don't be too harsh or too nice. I actually want the outside perspective. Thank you!",6,1730064794.0,MuslimMarriage,9,0.88,False
1gdlv5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1gdlv5c/welcome_to_the_neighborhood_hope_reborn_review/,Welcome To The Neighborhood (Hope Reborn Review),"[Master Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1g5s9ey/tales_from_the_red_hope_reborn_cyberpunk_red/)

This adventure,¬†*Welcome To The Neighborhood* by Linda M. Evans, is the one that convinced me I needed to review this book. And not in the ""What the Hell were they *thinking?""* kind of way. I won't bury the lede here:

**This chapter was worth the cost of the whole book for me, and adds even more value for new GMs.**

SPOILER WARNING. Obviously, we're going to be reviewing the scenario, and that means you might be spoiled for both this scenario and others in the book. You have been warned.

The titular neighborhood in *Welcome To The Neighborhood* is Woodland Park, a small area with a lot of problems that Edgerunners can solve. In D&D terms, it's a starting town. This is Phandalin meets Hommlet, with street level problems that break down easily for PC involvement and resolution. It's an excellent example of the form, hitting all the beats it needs to without feeling boring or formulaic. 

For this review, I'm going to change up my usual format. I'm going to review what the adventure's about, both theme- and plot-wise, and then we're going to break down the elements of a starting neighborhood. Then I'm going to show you how I took those elements and created a new neighborhood for my Edgerunners in my current campaign.

The reason for the change up is pretty simple: there's very little wrong here, and a lot of ""Oh, sweet!"" schmeared on top. I figured that my normal structure would be a lot of gushing and little else, and I didn't want to do that to you.

Standard warning: any criticisms here are leveled with the intent of letting the designers improve their craft and grow. Please do not harass anyone based on this review, or try to get people fired, or run off at the mouth about how anyone needs to kill themselves.

If you are thinking about any of these actions all I can say is: Dude. Don't be a dick.

**Summary:**

Woodland Park is where Jack Skorkowsky is recommending they relocate the Forlorn Hope. Marianne and the Professor, having been around the block a time or two, ask the PCs to move into the neighborhood for about a month and put their finger on the pulse of the area.

For reference, the neighborhood is on the border of New Westbrook, Heywood, and the Badlands, meaning it's about here:

[Yes, I added the large black dot. You're welcome.](https://preview.redd.it/qoyknsgnucxd1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3a77dfffc895efa25ecfd7b667576cd162beb9)

PCs being PCs, their fingers go a lot of other places, too. This might have been an ill-considered metaphor, but I'm not changing it. 

Anyway, Marianne's offering 500 eb per person per week, for about 2,000 eb per person for the job. There are housing options for every reasonable starting Edgerunner, from cube hotel to upscale conapt. From there, there  are five jobs around the area that they can get involved in:

* **The Shark**: A full-bore hostage rescue situation, trying to *Rainbow Six* your way through to rescue some captive guerrilla gardeners. 
* **Boys' Night Out:** You have to rescue a man from (and I am not making this up) a Goddamned carnivorous  palm tree.
* **Wheels On Fire:** Play as a replacement team for the local roller derby club so their match can go off.
* **Turf War:** A *Seven Samurai*\-inspired job where you face down a gang that's trying to buy up Woodland Park by forcing residents out of their homes.
* **Love Lies Dying:** Head into the Badlands to rescue two people from a *127 Hours*\-style situation.

All of these are fairly basic in form. A couple have some small problems. For example, in **The Shark**, the adventure suggests using windows to break into the place where the hostages are. However, no exterior windows are shown on the map, and the text doesn't tell you which room you are entering into. Despite that, you can parse it if you're paying attention, and make a quick judgment call about where folks are supposed to land.

So what makes them so good? The fact that they're well-executed with a fun twist. There's never a single route to solve a problem, but multiple paths to success (with varying costs to execute) are described with robust GM support to help adjudication. And while the problems are simple, they're never *boring*. Take **Love Lies Dying*****,*** for example. Not only is man vs nature an underexplored theme in *Cyberpunk*, it's not exactly easy to rescue these guys. We're talking checks at DV 24, with death as a consequence. The opposition is low tech, but it ain't low-stakes. 

In addition, the NPCs are well-realized and look like they're going to be fun to play. Nana and Pop-Pop, the ~~drug dealers~~ independent pharmacologists are the ones I'm looking forward to. I swear to God they sound like Helen Mirren and Tommy Chong in my head. Beyond this, there are locations for pretty much every basic need a crew of Edgerunners might have (see below). 

**Break Down:**

Woodland Park has several elements the PCs can play with. Let's break these down:

* **Somewhere to live:** As mentioned it has housing options ranging from cube hotel to cargo container to upscale conapt. However, there are a few other areas that your PCs could take over and start using as their own established home base. Billy Flight even works as a low-level Fixer. 
* **Something to mess with:** In this case, the BioTechnica Palm Grove. It's a standout incongruity that players love to poke at.
* **Place to hang out:** Xanadu, the Muses' club (the roller derby team mentioned in **Wheels On Fire**), is a great place for the Crew to plan heists, get drinks, and host important meetings. It's a place to see, be seen, and use as a substitute for therapy.
* **Place to get essentials:** The Burning Bright Bodega stocks most things 100 eb or less - no need to worry about where they bought something. This gives them an easy place to go shopping. Indeed, it also gives them more of a reason to care about the bodega, since that's where they get most of their day-to-day items. 
* **Niche store:** A store that's focused on one particular need. In the case of Breeze, it sells drugs. Not only does this help the GM if anyone starts asking ""Where can I get the synthcoke?"" it also gives a fun inversion of the usual drug dealer archetype. These drug dealers are a friendly neighborhood couple rather than a furtive scumbag. 
* **Place to eat:** The Terminus food truck (located in the cargo container village) is where the PCs can grab food and probably rumors about what's happening in the neighborhood. It's a D&D tavern with a *Cyberpunk* reimagining. 

You've probably already figured this out, but this neatly addresses most of the things a GM is going to have to invent on the fly. Need a local club for the Crew hang out at? BOOM! Xanadu. Need to grab a bite? BOOM! Terminus or the bodega. Need a starting Fixer? BOOM! Here's Billy. Need a place to live? Well, what's your budget, choomba?

**This right here is why this chapter is so useful for new GMs.** You could run a whole campaign and start it in this neighborhood, slowly working your way from neighborhood problems to tackling your own personal ones and letting the campaign grow organically. 

I hope this area gets packaged into a starter set quick, fast, and in a hurry, because this is really good work. 

**Your Own Twist:**

So sure, you can run the campaign as-is, and that will work once for any given group. But by giving us excellent archetypes to draw from, Ms. Evans and Mr. Gray have enabled us to rework these pieces so that they can work for almost any group!

Let me show you what I'm talking about using my current campaign. As to background: my current campaign (around Session 7 when this book came out), was heading toward a confrontation with the Piranhas and MiliTech. As the PCs escaped, I directed them toward a new neighborhood in South Night City. South NC being a Combat Zone (at least in my game), that meant no exec housing, but everything else could basically be ported over. A few key things to keep in mind:

* One of my PCs has a link to [Project Cynosure](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cynosure)
* All of them hate the Piranhas
* I wanted to set up a confrontation with the Red Chrome Legion

On to the meat of the matter:

* **Somewhere to live:** The PCs' fixer got them space in an abandoned fire station located in South Night City, complete with a giant hole in the floor, dry rot, mold, and a completely scavenged car chassis. 

https://preview.redd.it/h0z2nyeg6dxd1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=906e245d98b10885b769f8ac03b415c7fe068f7e

   * But it still works as an HQ they can slowly upgrade over time, building toward something awesome.
* **Something to mess with:** A corrupted hologram, flashing incoherent red lettering in scrolling hexadecimal code. No one's dug around it because tech keeps going haywire near the hologram. The source of the hologram is a buried Chimera hexapod tank, piloted by an insane AI freed from Project Cynosure.  
* **Place to hang out:** The Library, a hollowed out concrete shell of a building with hundreds of old-school books stacked inside. The lady who runs it, Screamer, is a mute woman who charges eddies to borrow books, drink coffee, or if you get too loud. She's being slowly squeezed out of business by the Piranhas, who are escalating her protection fees. 
* **Place to get essentials:** The 411, a corner bodega under surveillance from Consolidated Brands because the owner occasionally gets fresh ganja in from the Dirty Hippies. Piranhas are also pressuring her to stop selling coffee to the Library. Red Chrome Legionnaires are now starting to mess with her business, threatening to start a turf war with the Piranhas. 
* **Niche store:** The View, a braindance store with a selection of tuned and fairly vanilla experiences (having a family, watching TV together, eating dinner communally) so that people inside a Combat Zone can get a taste of what regular life might be like. 
* **Place to eat:** Tac0 H3ll, a food truck run by an ex-Red Chromer named Dieter Hausen, now looking to make amends. Regular death threats made against him by his old gang chooms.

Then, because the roller derby angle was too good to pass up, I created two roller derby teams who practice in the neighborhood. One is the Red Chrome Legion's extremely fit biosculpted Aryan Supermen, and the other is a a group of women who called themselves the Princesses of Punishment, and who dress up as characters from the early Disney Renaissance. 

See? I didn't have to reinvent the wheel or even get all that creative. I just threw in multiple factions competing for resources, all plugged into conflicts I know my players will want to get involved in, and able to deliver challenges across several dimensions. That's why this chapter is so good!

**Conclusion:**

I would love to give this chapter a 10/10, but the little issues (like the window thing in the Shark) hold me back a bit. I'd say a 9.5/10 with a strong recommendation from me.

Why do people do this and what even happened? ,"I met a guy online a bit over a month ago. We were both attracted to each other and had really great chemistry, similar interest and life style. I liked his personality and has a large dog. I didn‚Äôt grow up with dogs but it was nice to play with his dog. For the first 2.5 weeks, there was a lot of excitement - we did activities together, checked out new coffee shops, restaurants, hiked, went for long walks with his dog and I even met some of his co workers spontaneously one day. He told me that it feels right with me a week in and started calling me ‚Äúbaby‚Äù. He also said he ‚Äúdates like it‚Äôs a hobby‚Äù. In retrospect he was love bombing me and the fact that he dates like a hobby was a bit of a yellow flag for me. I understand in the beginning it‚Äôs normal to go on dates with a few people before you start to focus on one person. We saw each other 12 times over the span of a month (two being spontaneous) and yes that is a lot. We didn‚Äôt have the exclusive talk and I knew that he was still going on a lot of dates. He never told me if he‚Äôs going on a date with someone else but I knew based on his texting patterns and the fact that he would forget things I told him or mix things up and that felt yucky to me (probably because he was seeing too many people?). Most people would think that you slow down on seeing others when you‚Äôre seeing one person for the 12th time and I think because he didn‚Äôt slow down, it made me hesitant to have that exclusivity talk with him. Because he was seeing still seeing other people, it was hard to get to know him on a deeper level because mentally it felt like his attention was all over the place. 

In addition to why I wasn‚Äôt ready to have the talk - two weeks ago, I noticed the energy was off. Slower responses, quality of text went down, the excitement wasn‚Äôt as intense. He stopped calling me ‚Äúbaby‚Äù (even though to me it was weird that he called me that so early on‚Ä¶should be a name reserved for your bf/gf not someone you‚Äôre just seeing). I also noticed that he doesn‚Äôt ask me a lot of question‚Ä¶wouldn‚Äôt you want to know me at a deeper level? I‚Äôm not saying you need to know everything about me but I would think that by date #12 I would know him on a deeper level but it felt like it was always me asking questions. We had a good time when we saw each other but it lacked depth I think? Another reason I wasn‚Äôt ready to have the talk because I realized I didn‚Äôt like how his apartment smelled like his large dog. Am I being too picky? But once I enter his place the smell of dog engulfs you then you get used to it after a while but I started to wonder if I can deal with that if I were in a relationship with him. Another thing I was unsure of was his complicated family dynamic. My family isn‚Äôt perfect too but in my previous relationship, complicated and unresolved traumatic family past really affected our relationship and the level of emotional depth he had for me. As such I was aware of this possibility with him‚Ä¶not a deal breaker but something I considered.

This is where it went downhill. Last week he said he will plan a Halloween activity with me for this weekend. Friday comes and no updates from him. I text him saying I‚Äôm assuming we aren‚Äôt meeting up but I just wanted to check in. He text me back saying he‚Äôs busy during the weekend and will be doing some Halloween activity and ends by saying thanks for checking in. What really annoyed me was the fact that he didn‚Äôt even apologize and he probably forgot that he told me he would plan specifically a Halloween activity. I believe he is doing that activity with another girl. I message back saying I feel like we are drifting and I‚Äôm going to go my own direction and I wished him all the best. His response was that he wanted to ponder it over the weekend to be sure before texting me, however he agrees with me. He feels like he‚Äôs being pulled in different directions and needs time to figure things out. Ends with saying he would like to still be friends if I want. I chose not to respond back and I know I don‚Äôt want to be friends. I‚Äôve been feeling a bit sad, disappointed and angry because I feel like the number of times we saw each other deserved more explanation than the way he responded. His response also shows no accountability especially since when we had a really good time not that long ago. It would have been different if we just went on one or a few dates then I don‚Äôt feel like people owe others anything. 

At the same time I wonder if I shut him down too quickly. Perhaps instead of saying I sense we are drifting I could have framed it as a question ‚Äúare we drifting? Can we talk about it?‚Äù. However in the moment I knew his response wasn‚Äôt acceptable to me and I know if I guy wants to he would. I may have been more forgiving if he said hey I‚Äôm busy over the weekend but what about next week and proceed to have a chat with him about where we are at? I almost wanted to follow up and ask him why he was unsure because I have no idea what went wrong besides he may have found someone better. Another possibility is that he has pointed out to me that I have an RBF. I know I do but I‚Äôve also been complimented that I have a beautiful smile by others too. So essentially I swing from an RBF to a really big smile. Maybe he didn‚Äôt like my extreme facial expressions lol?

Also the current online dating scene is depressing and I know I was very attracted to him and his personality so it feels even more of a loss to me that it didn‚Äôt work out in such an abrupt way.

But there is one thing that just annoys me. My blood sugar at night hovers around 90 all night. When I get up in the morning, it's around 90 (so not dawn phenomenon), then about an hour after I'm up and about, my blood sugar will go to 140. I'm experimented with cutting out my coffee, not eating a thing, eating protein, taking a walk when I first get up... but nothing affects it much. Cutting out my coffee with creamer helped a bit, but 10 points maybe. It always rises to 130-140. 

It does fall down in an hour or two (to about 100), and 140 is far better than it used to be years ago, but it still annoys me to watch my bs go up for no reason except my liver decides to dump.

This year I turned 25 which is a big deal in my family so as normal I started planning my own party however this year my family wanted to help, I let them and here's how it went down hill. My mom went to pick up the cake I had placed three days In advance she picks up the cake and they tell her it's gonna taste better this way and it'll be easier to cut. I seen the cake and not only did they put the disgusting coffee chocolate shaving on it when it was support to have chocolate bark they also put what looked likes expired and beat up cherries on the cake. I called to speak with manager was placed on a 15 minute hold when he then told me they could fix it. I thought great I'm coming in. I came in not even five minutes later from the phone call and was told the baker wasn't in and can't remake the cake till tomorrow and it won't be ready until Tuesday when I needed it on Monday for my birthday. The only cakes they had left were small cakes or fruit cakes which 1 I have a family of 14 alone and the fruit cakes from this store is always nasty. I was upset and ready to fight as this isn't the first time they have messed up. I brought a sushi platter from them and I placed that order two weeks in advance for my sisters birthday and the day I went to pick it up not only was it not ready it was never made! Yet I had already paid for it they tried to give me a fruit platter instead like I said the fruit is nasty but I was short on time so I said okay then the fruit platter didn't have any premade fruit so I could get that and when I asked for a refund I was told there was no manager who could issues my refund this large as it was 50 dollars worth of sushi, as well as when I order my daughter first birthday cake I was supposed to get a free baby smash cake I again put this order in two weeks in advance and not only did they get the flavor wrong but I had to find a manager to tell the baker it was supposed to come with a smash cake, that she then pulled from a freezer and slapped some icing on it. Now back to my birthday as I went to turn and find a manager to get myself a refund I was called a Karen from someone else in the store who then pushed me with her cart fed up at this point I threw my cake in the persons faces and walked off refund be damned!

BF and I have been together for 5 years, living together for 3 and have 2 dogs. My boyfriend loves sports, video games, and golfing with his friends. He spends almost every Saturday or Sunday golfing, and plays video games nearly every night. I wouldn‚Äôt mind, but getting him to spend time with me, like going out to dinner or breakfast or watching tv shows, can be difficult. Sometimes he‚Äôll do an eyeroll and acquiesce to breakfast or a tv show together. If we do go out, it‚Äôs brief, and then he‚Äôs back to his games. I enjoy the outdoors and exploring the city, but he doesn‚Äôt like malls or farmers markets or walking around the city to explore, which limits our weekend activities to dinner/breakfast/movie or some paid activity like cooking classes. He‚Äôs also not proactive in planning things for us, so if I want to do something new, ie a cooking class, I have to book it and plan it. His idea of time together is having dinner and watching TV before he goes back to video games. I feel jealous of the time he spends with his friends, taking random days off to play golf with them, but never for me. Even with our dogs, I‚Äôm the one walking them alone everyday, taking different trails or going to new coffee shops. It feels like he‚Äôs with me for convenience; I always have to initiate our hangouts. Is this normal in relationships? Are some men really like this, even if they love someone?

I (39M)  live in this town for a limited time due to work. I went on three fabulous dates with a woman (32F) for two weeks. During the third date, I realized that things would be progressing physically that night. That night, at her place, I felt a great connection, and we sat very close to each other on her couch, where we had a lot of touching and playful banter. I realized she didn't know I was leaving town in a few months, and we hadn't discussed how serious of a relationship we were both looking for. As such, I respectfully ended the night with a nice hug and did not attempt to escalate physically. I did not want to be that guy who told her, ""I'm not looking for anything super serious,"" AFTER having sex. 

I definitely felt like she wanted more that night. Being an overthinker, I texted the next day, telling her I needed to explain what happened. She agreed to meet up again for dinner, but this time, she was sure to include ""as friends"" in the plan. We had a great dinner and both found out neither is looking for anything serious as we are both coming off serious long-term relationships, and on top of that, I am leaving town soon. We agreed to continue hanging out as friends, and we've been essentially going on what I would consider ""dates"" just the two of us: more dinners, drinks, lunch, coffee, etc.

I have never had the experience of having a close female friend, especially one that started with romantic dates and then transitioned to friendship. During our friend hangouts, we still have playful banter, light touching, laughing, and joking. Between hanging out, we text a fair amount and have shared many deep and personal stories. 

Part of me now wants to explore this relationship beyond friendship. In other words, I'm starting to feel like this could be an excellent relationship worth pursuing and figuring things out even after I move. However, I cannot tell if she would still be up for it, and I don't want to make things super awkward friendship-wise by bringing this up too suddenly. 

My question is from a woman's perspective: How permanent is that switch in your mind when you decide this man is now a ""friend""? Are there any subtle ways for me to glimpse any attractiveness still there? 

Part of me thinks the fact that we continue to hang out and have fun, just the two of us (and often), means there is an attraction. However, another part of me thinks she now just sees me as an awesome friend and someone fun and safe to hang out with.

Few people I messaged from Psychology Today didn't work out, either they had no room, no English, or no in-person sessions.

I decided to get out of my comfort zone and booked with an opposite gender. The office was in a basement, therapy room had no window, the therapist sat closer to the door, kinda blocking me, we were alone in the office. I didn't feel comfortable. After appointment I went to washroom and my face was red, it got too warm in the therapy room. The washroom floor was filthy and it was tiny. The therapist was nice, but they were asking questions as if trying to fit me in some kind of category. They had good body language, but some feelings of guilt I shared with them, it was clear that it was wild and unexplainable for them.  

Then I had another appointment with different therapist. This one was also out of my comfort zone, because she comes from same geographical area overseas as myself. Our countries sharing political and economical background. The building was a run down clinic, giving Silent Hill vibes. Washroom was horrible and tiny. There was a depressing ocean landscape art in the cold waiting area.

The therapy room was dark and the therapist was sitting too far away, I could barely make out her face. I had to share more and more disturbing events to get a reaction from her. I shared a word that my mom used to call me, this word also has a meaning in her native language, but she made an expression like she didn't understand how that was problematic. I suspect she was called that word herself or she calls it her children.

Both therapists were ""bossing"" by not giving me an option to schedule biweekly. 

Meanwhile in Winnipeg, I used to go to a cozy office with comfy furniture and relaxing atmosphere. Oil diffuser and a meditative music playing. A coffee table with coloring books, crayons, mindfulness books. Washroom was big and clean, the therapy room had soft lighting, soft couch. A blanket, pillow, tissue box were provided. You could make a tea or grab a cold drink from waiting area. I was feeling safe and comfortable. I didn't know it was a luxury. Therapy price was a bit cheaper than here in Montreal. 

Honestly, this experience really demotivated me. I don't know if I should give these professionals more chance/money or if I should keep looking or if I should just give up on therapy. I could also feel the language barrier with both of these therapists. I just moved here and I already wanna go back lol

I‚Äôm writing to wholeheartedly endorse my good friend and former boss, Ms. Gigi Hanna, for Yucaipa City Council District 3. When I saw her campaign post on Facebook, I wasn‚Äôt surprised‚ÄîGigi‚Äôs commitment to her community runs deep.

Let‚Äôs get to know Gigi a bit. She is the retired Elected City Clerk of San Bernardino, with a proven track record of community engagement, team-building, and leadership in governmental affairs. Gigi consistently prioritized her constituents over politics, often taking time to meet with residents at local coffee shops to hear their concerns. At first, I found these extra efforts inconvenient, and I wasn‚Äôt sure they were necessary. It wasn‚Äôt the listening that seemed excessive to me, but the effort she put in to connect with people personally. She even brought me along to some of these meetings, which taught me valuable lessons about transparency and effective communication.

One particular instance sticks out in my mind‚Äîa meeting with a police lieutenant where she skillfully pushed back on an issue without letting herself be intimidated. Her persistence and effectiveness earned her the trust of San Bernardino‚Äôs voters, who elected her twice. She always emphasized the importance of honesty and transparency, values I continue to carry with me.

Today, Gigi serves as the Executive Director for Habitat for Humanity in the San Bernardino Area. Her experience includes working with the Metropolitan Water District and as a reporter for several newspapers, including the *San Bernardino County Sun*. I had the privilege of working under Gigi‚Äôs leadership from 2016 to 2019 in San Bernardino‚Äîa challenging time that required dedication and hard work to navigate opposition and doubts.

For these reasons, I fully endorse Gigi Hanna and urge the residents of Yucaipa to vote for her for City Council District 3. Gigi‚Äôs dedication, integrity, and commitment to transparency make her the leader Yucaipa needs.

1gdlbr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1gdlbr0/aita_for_trying_to_distance_myself_from_a_friend/,AITA for trying to distance myself from a friend who has a crush on me and relies on me for emotional support?,"Throwaway and on mobile, so please bear with me. I (F18) recently became friends with someone I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúAva‚Äù (F17). We met a few months ago through some shared classes, and we clicked decently well. Ava was a bit clingy from the start‚Äîalways wanting to hang out or talk. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and honestly thought it was kind of sweet. She even started bringing me little gifts every now and then, like coffee or small trinkets. I appreciated it, though I‚Äôll admit I found it a little odd for how recently we met.

Then, about a week ago, I got a call from her around midnight. I picked up, and right away, I could tell something was off. Her speech was slurred, and she kept saying things like, ‚ÄúI just needed to make sure you were real and not a hallucination,‚Äù and going on about how I was this ‚Äúbeacon of light‚Äù in her life. She talked about how she wished she were a bird, asked if I thought hope was real‚Äîit was all over the place, like nothing I‚Äôd ever heard from her before. I spent around half an hour trying to calm her down, telling her to go inside, get some water, and try to sleep. Eventually, I managed to convince her, but the whole thing left me pretty shaken. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôd taken something or if she was going through some mental health crisis (she had hinted at struggles before).

A few days later, I found out through mutual friends that Ava had gotten her hands on some alcohol and was almost certainly drunk when she called me. I also heard that she might have a crush on me, with one friend saying she was ‚Äúcompletely smitten.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to think. I started feeling uncomfortable, not just because of the call, but because I worried that our friendship meant a lot more to her than I‚Äôd realized.

A few days after that, Ava actually confronted me about the incident. She apologized for calling so late and confessed to drinking. I accepted her apology and told her I wanted to be supportive but wasn‚Äôt a professional, nor had I gone through anything close to what she was facing. She seemed to understand, and I thought that was the end of it.

However, after that conversation, Ava kept reaching out, asking if we could call so she could ‚Äúdistract herself‚Äù or asking for my advice on things. I started to feel like she was relying on me more than she should. I wanted to be there for her, but I was also dealing with my own issues, and I couldn‚Äôt be her therapist. I tried to gently set boundaries, but she kept clinging. She even brought me another gift, which I politely declined, saying that she should focus on herself rather than spending money on me. I could tell she was a bit hurt, but she said she understood.

Not long after, one of her friends confronted me. They accused me of abandoning her and said I was selfish for backing away when she needed me the most, especially knowing she had feelings for me. I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to say‚ÄîI never wanted her to feel like a burden, and it kills me to think I might have made her feel that way. But I have my own struggles and don‚Äôt feel equipped to support both of us.

Now, I‚Äôm questioning everything, wondering if I‚Äôm just leaving her stranded when she needs help the most. AITA?",1,1730063294.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

We fly in at 6am and renting a car. Originally we planned to eat at the airport and go straight to Blue Lagoon but been reading reviews on here and it‚Äôs sounding like folks are suggesting sky lagoon is better than blue in terms of value, reliably good time and not being as tourist-trappy. Blue has bookings as early as 8am, but Sky‚Äôs earliest is 11:30am atm.

Should we drive to Reykjavik and have coffee and breakfast there then head to sky instead of doing blue? We want to avoid eating at either lagoon for cost and quality‚Ä¶

5:00 Wake up to begin the day much to the wife‚Äôs discontent and hissing. Couldn‚Äôt sleep well due to being psyched out. Somebody said on r/1811 ‚Äúbeing psyched out is what kills you‚Äù so I guess I‚Äôm already dead. 

5:30 Make coffee to begin the ritual of cleanse above the porcelain throne. Gotta shed some weight before the run. A scientific article with minimal peer review said exercise helps with interviews. I‚Äôll take what I can get. 

6:00 Drive to the lake trail while listening to FBI Retired Case File Review. I love you Jerri give me strength. 

6:30 5 mile run around a local lake. Lots of Abuelitas and Ajummas walking around already. A shirtless jogger wearing Alphaflys just passed me. Remind myself I am in peak physical fitness worthy of the FBI. 

7:30 Drive back home while listening to Jerri again. Dream of one day being on the podcast although realize that the show most likely won‚Äôt be around 30 years from now which makes me sad. 

8:00 Make some breakfast to apologize to the wife. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes. She eats them happily and forgets I woke her up early. Jokes on her she‚Äôs going to have to help me with the interview practice for three hours today. 

9:00 start reviewing some answers I‚Äôve made. The google doc has gotten a little out of hand as it‚Äôs now nearing 40 pages of possible questions and answers. Start wondering maybe I‚Äôm over preparing. I lie to myself by saying I can‚Äôt possibly over prepare and add one more question I think they might ask. 

12:00 It‚Äôs lunch time. Start reading some r/1811 posts. Another ‚ÄúGot the Call!‚Äù post that I upvote. Good for you pal. Jesus, I see what you have done for others‚Ä¶.

12:30 Take a break with the wife to veg together on our phones. Read a post on r/1811 about how he got BQA‚Äôed during his second USSS run during Background. Jesus he even got LASIK and got so close... Sometimes rejection is protection. 

14:00 Wife decides I‚Äôve done enough and drags me to go shopping with her. Decide I should go get a nice tie for the interview. 

15:00 Find a tie but also an American flag lapel pin. Debate on maybe wearing it to demonstrate my patriotism in the interview. Wife tells me I‚Äôll look like a dork. 

18:00 Finish eating dinner. Ask wife to mock interview me. She seems eager until I show her the 30 questions she has to ask me. 

21:00 I seem to have nailed the core stories. Perhaps I am ready. The wife‚Äôs glazed over eyes aren‚Äôt much of an encouragement.

22:00 reading r/1811 again in bed. Somebody absolutely shit the bed during their interview. My horror grows the more I read it. Jesus Christ I see what you have done to him I don‚Äôt want that‚Ä¶ Wait he passed?!

It is often repeated that the McCanns were unaware of their surroundings in Praia da Luz as they were only tourists but further investigation proves this wrong.

In her book 'Madeleine' Kate mentions their love of sport, specifically running.

*""Gerry was good at sport, too, and being Gerry he was hugely competitive. Middle-distance running was his forte and at seventeen he was the fastest in Scotland in his age group over 800 metres. At Glasgow University he ran with the Hares and Hounds club, whose team strip was a hideous bright yellow.""*

*""In our spare time Gerry and I would go out for meals with friends or run in the fields around Queniborough. Gerry played the occasional game of squash and joined Rothley Park Golf Club.""*

**The McCanns' holiday in Praia da Luz:**

As written by Kate McCann:

""Most afternoons the children went back to their clubs, while we played tennis, **went for a run** or read and chatted by the pool.""

""While our three were having fun elsewhere with their buddies, there would be a rare chance for Gerry and me to spend time together playing tennis, **going for a run** or just relaxing.""

Sunday 29 April 2007: ""In the afternoon the children went back to their clubs and, after a leisurely hour by the pool with Fiona, David and Dianne, **Gerry and I took a run along the beach.** Being able to play tennis and run together for the first time in ages was a real treat.""

2 May 2007: ""Today it rained. The children went to their clubs, but our tennis lessons were postponed. Instead we joined Fiona, David and Dianne at the Millennium restaurant for coffee. We then returned to our apartment and a little while later **I left again, to go for a run with Matt**. I‚Äôd bought a new pair of running shoes a few days before we‚Äôd left for Portugal and they were certainly getting a good initiation.""

3 May 2007: ""Having arranged for Gerry to meet the children, **I opted to go for a run** along the beach, where I spotted the rest of our holiday group. \[...\] **I had finished my run by five-thirty** at the Tapas area, where I found Madeleine and the twins already having their tea with Gerry.""

Matt Oldfield's witness statement: ""**I went running with Kate at lunchtime, she's quite a good runner,** and we went out on the road all the way up to the main junc, erm, the sort of main road where you access Praia da Luz from and then back'. Police officer: 'What sort of distance would that be?' 'Erm, yeah, I think it'd be about **three or four miles, maybe each way**'. Police officer: 'And you run, do you often run?' Matt's reply: 'Erm, no, I don't like it, but I quite like it on holiday when it's a bit warmer and it's not so bad on your joints and I quite like running on the beach, \[...\] she's quite a good runner and I quite enjoy it every now and again, but, if it's sort of unusual and you're sort of **exploring** a bit'. \[...\] I think **Kate might have run most days**, because she was quite a keen runner, and it may just be that either I thought I'd go for a run and she was already changed, or I was changed and, or Gerry might have said that, erm, I'm speculating, it may just have been coincidence that we both got into running gear and then decided to run together'. Police officer: 'But you went on this route and are saying you found it quite hard to keep up.' Matt: 'Yeah, well, yeah, **she's quite a good runner**'.

The route Matt goes on to describe is far beyond the borders of the Ocean Club resort.

Fiona Payne's witness statement: ""And then it was time to pick up the kids, so Kate and I walked from the Tapas area over to the main reception, going between, you know, there was a sort of **path that went between** the other Ocean Club complex as well along the road, erm, and she picked up Madeleine and I picked up Scarlet and then we walked back together and that was the only day we ever did, ever did that.""

Kate's witness statement: ""Both of them took Madeleine to the other creche. They went via a path in front of the small reception and then through gardens and stairs, **taking a short cut**. This route was the one mentioned by Gerry.""

Kate's book: ""After preparing some lunch, I went with Fiona to pick up Madeleine and Scarlett, who was in the adjoining Baby Club, taking her on the **quicker route** through the grounds of the Ocean Club, **which she \[Fiona\] hadn‚Äôt yet discovered**.""

Kate had already figured out the short cuts after a only few days in Luz.

**So after six days of running around and exploring Praia da Luz, it's safe to say that the McCanns knew their way around the village.**

Even after Maddie was reported missing the McCanns went on runs around the village of Luz.

*""I also felt a compulsion to run up to the top of the Rocha Negra. Somehow, inflicting physical pain on myself seemed to be the only possible way of escaping my internal pain.""*

*""Monday 14 May. Today I went for my first run since Madeleine was taken. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt run or exercise generally might wonder why, and more to the point, how I could possibly do this in the circumstances. Why is easy. Exercise, and running in particular, is good for the mind as well as the body. It can induce a sense of well-being, lifting your mood, and aids the relief of stress, anxiety and sleeplessness. \[...\] However, I was also driven by additional and more complicated motives. One was that somehow I knew running would help numb the torment, albeit temporarily. \[...\] I remember speeding along the beach, concentrating totally on Madeleine. I had a picture of her in my hand which I would squeeze when I felt tired to spur me on, especially going up the sharply rising Rua da Praia. I could not have entertained stopping. Simultaneously I was saying a decade of the rosary in my head. When I returned to the apartment block, I sat on the steps at the bottom and cried like a baby. Either the run or the crying, or both, seemed to induce a sense of calm. That first weekend I‚Äôd felt a burning desire to run up the Rocha Negra, and Gerry and I would in fact do so many times over the next few months.""*

16 May 2007: *""Gerry played tennis with Seddo, David and the Mark Warner tennis coach. \[...\] Although I‚Äôd been for a run two days before, to me, as I‚Äôve said, this seemed a necessity rather than a pleasure, and there is no doubt there was an element of self-punishment to it. All recreational activities seemed inappropriate, verging on disrespectful, and because they weren‚Äôt yet right for me, I found it hard to understand how Gerry could enjoy them,""*

Gerry's blog posts also mention running:

20 May 2007: *""Kate is a keen runner and in the last few days has tried to include a run in the daily routine. Yesterday (Sat) at 7am we ran to the monument at the top of the steep cliff overlooking Praia de Luz. We reached it in 19 minutes.""*

27 May 2007: *""Strange day after all the activity during the week. Kate and I started off with an early morning run to the the top of the nearby cliffs.""*

17 June 2007: *""Kate and I managed an early morning run before church.""*

Still to this day Kate and Gerry go on runs together and compete in marathons and triathlons.

So, it's very possible that after six days of running around and exploring Praia da Luz, the McCanns knew their way around the village.

1gdl0ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gdl0ag/we_built_a_resort_on_my_grandfathers_property_we/,We Built a Resort on My Grandfather's Property. We Shouldn't Have.,"Before the burnt people took over, my grandfather‚Äôs homestead was an oasis of calm.

The homestead was in the midst of the steppe but neither forest nor mountains were far. My cousin and I spent most of our childhoods there. It was a good place for young boys to grow up. Our parents worked, the city was rough and the old man could always use an extra pair of hands.

We had free reign over the property but our grandfather always warned us to not venture into the nearby forest. At night, by the light of the stove, he would tell us stories about a dark place of science which we were to avoid at all costs.

He called it the “í—ã–ª—ã–º–∏ “õ–æ–Ω–¥—ã—Ä“ì—ã.

Though tales of evil and corruption and the incomprehensible piqued our young interest, neither me nor my cousin disobeyed our grandfather‚Äôs instructions. As long as we were obedient, the old man was kind. Neither of us were interested in seeing his anger. Though the prospect of a cursed science facility provoked all sorts of alluring vapors from our imagination, we kept our selves satiated by playing with the massive turtles we‚Äôd find in the grass.

After we finished our schooling, my cousin moved out West. He always had a mind for business and thought of himself as the next great global innovator. I, on the other hand, preferred a quieter life. For a couple of years, I worked in the city doing jobs not worth mention and then, when the honking of cars and smell of smog got on my nerves, I moved back out into the homestead to help care for the old man.

As we grew older and wearier of fairy tales, my grandfather shifted his stories from the fantastical to practical warnings about drugs, guns, and affairs with married women. Yet, near the end of his life, confined to his bed with me as his sole caretaker, the old man returned to speaking of the “í—ã–ª—ã–º–∏ “õ–æ–Ω–¥—ã—Ä“ì—ã.

He pleaded with me, as if he could see the future in his fevered dreams, that both me and my cousin and anyone we cared for were to stay away from the forest. He also demanded that we never sell the property, lest it ends up in the hands of forces beyond the reach of man.

At the time, I dismissed his words as the ramblings of an unwell mind.

The funeral was a small, private affair for a quiet man who lived in solitude. There is much bureaucracy associated with properly burying the dead. It‚Äôs in the various office waiting rooms that I made peace with my grandfather‚Äôs passing. The funeral, to me, was but an end to the legal proceedings by then.

As distant as the ceremony was to me, however, during the funeral repast I found a familiar face that brought tears to my eyes. It was my cousin. He had traveled across half the globe to come pay his respects. Though he missed the burial, he stayed for the food.

When I found out he had arrived straight from the airport and was yet to arrange his accommodation, I didn‚Äôt ask. I insisted. My cousin would sleep in the guest-house at the homestead. He was, after all, going to be inheriting half of it.

My cousin was happy to accompany me out of town. He was curious about how my life had been over the past couple of years. He was also curious about the property.

My cousin had made a name for himself out West. Initially, he worked for an import/export company that he quickly rose through the ranks of and, once he had accumulated enough capital, he started to invest. He had made a name for himself in stocks and he was in the process of making an even bigger name for himself in the realm of crypto-currency. Even though most of his money was tied up in the clouds, however, my cousin was curious about other investment opportunities.

For the first week he stayed with me, my cousin didn‚Äôt mention anything about developing the land. Occasionally, he would bemoan the lack of wi-fi or hot water, but for the most part he would speak about the inherent tranquility of the homestead. He said people out West would pay good money to get away from the rumble of urban life to a place like this.

It's not until a week into staying on the property that my cousin suggested we try setting up a business.

I did not like the idea of developing the land at first ‚Äî even when my cousin promised to shoulder all of the construction costs. I disliked the idea of strangers spending time at the homestead. I was resistant at first, but the man had a way with words.

He also owned half of the property.

The construction crew that worked on additional housing was beyond rowdy and tested my patience every step of the way. Yet, when they set up the water boiler in the guest house, they bought my sympathies. Daily hot showers soothed my temper and soon enough I found myself amicable to the idea of the homestead being turned into a resort.

As my cousin would say, we found much peace on the property when we were young. It would be a sin not to make some money off of sharing it.

After about a year and a half, the housing my cousin had commissioned was completed. The cottages were humble and my grandfather‚Äôs old home was transformed into a relaxing communal area. Though the lodgings were nice and my cousin offered them for a bargain, we had trouble finding customers.

My cousin had accrued a substantial amount of debt and was turning more agitated with every trip he took to the city. Apparently, along with the troubles with our new resort, his cryptocurrency portfolio had turned shaky. He floated the idea of selling the property, but he only did so once.

On his following trip to the city, he returned with Batima. Batima said she could ensure our resort would be well booked and my cousin‚Äôs financial woes would be fixed.

I have met few people with piercings throughout my life, but if they were to gather all their jewelry in a pile, they wouldn‚Äôt have even half of the metal Batima carried on her face. She dressed in garish bright colors and constantly smoked and didn‚Äôt inspire the smallest bit of confidence in me.

Batima looked well out of place at our steppe resort, yet she was well versed in the art of the internet. Though I did not know where to look whenever the two of us spoke, Batima kept to her promise. Soon enough, the resort was turning a profit.

Through social media and a couple of personal favors, Batima managed to bring our resort to the forefront of people‚Äôs search result. After but a couple of weeks, we had various influencers from around the world come through our little resort and sing praises to their audiences who in turn replicated their idol‚Äôs pilgrimage.

I would spend most of my time in my separated cottage, but whenever I walked through the lobby, Batima would be there. Sometimes, she‚Äôd be working on her laptop. Sometimes, she would be chatting with the guests and recommending hikes and other local attractions. We never spoke much.

For months, Batima remained a stranger to me. Yet, one morning, when two unexpected visitors showed up at our humble resort, I found an ally in her.

They both wore lab coats and introduced themselves as Doctor Barat and Professor Willow. Barat was local, had a messy head of black hair and seemed to be the less talkative of the two. Willow towered over his colleague and led all the negotiations. Willow, unlike Barat, was American. When the man realized I couldn‚Äôt properly understand him, he aimed all of his communication at my cousin and Batima.

My cousin made little effort to translate, but Batima was kind enough to keep me in the loop. The two men in lab coats, according to Batima, were representatives of a scientific organization that was looking for housing for their employees. They were interested in buying the property.

The offered sum spread a smile across my cousin‚Äôs face, yet Batima disagreed with it. Apparently, the place had more potential. I knew little of the financials, but I didn‚Äôt like Doctor Barat nor Professor Willow. I told my cousin I thought Batima was right and that I would not consent to a sale to the two men.

When my refusal was translated to Professor Willow, like a child, he stormed out of my cousin‚Äôs office. Doctor Barat hung around for a while longer, gently prodding at my cousin with the promise of quick cash, but when it became clear the property would not be sold, he too made his exit.

My cousin wasn‚Äôt pleased with how negotiations had panned out, but Batima soothed his woes. The resort was, after all, doing well. If he would give her time, she could bring in even more revenue with a couple renovations and investments. My cousin was reluctant yet eventually, with a fair amount of prodding from me, he acquiesced.

When the meeting was over, Batima walked me to my cottage.

‚ÄòI presume you‚Äôre familiar with the stories they tell about the nearby woods?‚Äô she asked, as she lit up her hand-rolled cigarette.

I told her I was.

‚ÄòAnd I presume you don‚Äôt believe in them?‚Äô

I told her I didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄòNeither do I,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòBut if I did, I would presume those two have business in that forest. I don‚Äôt believe in children‚Äôs fairy tales, but I also wouldn‚Äôt want to risk getting into bed with anyone from the “í—ã–ª—ã–º–∏ “õ–æ–Ω–¥—ã—Ä“ì—ã.‚Äô

It had been years since I heard the name. Each syllable of that terrible sound cracked through the cold air like invisible fireworks. I told her I agreed. I told her I agreed and thanked her for taking my side.

Though the land was not sold to the two men in lab coats, Batima kept her end of the bargain. Over the next half a year my grandfather‚Äôs homestead transformed once again. What was once a humble family resort became the *Detox Zone*.

The walls got brighter, the d√©cor took on a distinctly new-age aesthetic and the tranquil whistling of the wind was replaced with constant meditation music. The look of the resort was wholly foreign to me and I disliked the breed of entitled people that would replace our old clientele, but Batima kept her promise fully.

The *Detox Zone* brought in significantly more revenue than we ever saw before.

I retreated to my cottage, saved up my share of the profits and watched the resort grow at a distance. Every once in a while, Batima would drop by for tea and tell me tales of the bizarre questions the tourists would ask but our friendship was sporadic and only experienced in short bursts.

My cousin, on the other hand, would be at my cottage just about every week with a new bottle of expensive liquor. With every visit he would reveal more plans for expansion and new avenues for his money to grow. Every visit he offered to take me along for his investment adventures and every visit I declined.

There were moments when his talk of wealth and luxury had me doubting my resolve, but I am happy I kept my money safe. Were I to join him on his financial misadventures, I too would have end up destitute.

My cousin made some bad investments. A sizable chunk of his money went towards a locally produced hair loss product. In the same breath that he would bemoan all the lawsuits and his imminent financial ruin, the man would still swear by the hair cream.

A lot of money was sunk. Some serious people were involved. My cousin needed cash quick.

He didn‚Äôt even ask.

One morning, I simply found Professor Willow peeking into the window of my cottage. He had his face pressed up against the glass as if he were trying to spot an animal in a zoo. When he saw that I saw him, Willow‚Äôs eyes filled with malicious glee. He grinned and waved and stood still for nigh a minute and then, he left.

I barely pulled on my coat when my cousin barged into the room. He had made a deal, he assured me. A good pay out. A really good pay out. For the both of us, with a nice holiday bonus for Batima. Willow offered him considerably better money and, since he knew I didn‚Äôt want to leave the property, he even secured me ownership over the cottage.

Willow was just going to house scientists. It would be a calmer affair than the rich hippies. My cousin assured me that what he did was necessary and that I had no right to be angry with him.

I didn‚Äôt argue. I was angry, but my cousin looked to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown. I had seen the sort of business partners my cousin had. I knew he had little choice.

I was displeased with my cousin‚Äôs handling of the property, but by evening I found some solace in the idea of housing scientists. They would be, I hoped, a quiet bunch. I went to sleep that night presuming my life would not change much.

Soon enough, however, I would meet the burnt people.

It wasn‚Äôt long after the *Detox Zone* cleared out that I started to feel uneasy at night. Back when the resort was still functional, there would be outdoor lighting to make sure none of the tourists stumble off into the wilderness. I quickly found myself missing those blinding lights. Each night there was at least one moment I was certain someone was watching me from the darkness.

According to the deal my cousin struck, I was still allowed access to my cottage but the rest of the property was wholly off limits to me. The lobby of the resort was always guarded by a duo of tall men with shaved heads and a constant sneer on their face. At first, I thought I had simply witnessed two twins on the same shift, but as the days passed I always saw the same two faces. Just as the thoughts of how many of the same specimen might be employed as security, the guards were given helmets and their identity was obscured.

Another construction crew arrived at the resort a couple of weeks after the guards appeared. The crew was much quieter than anyone else who had ever worked on the property and they would actively ignore me when I tried to make idle chatter.

At first, I presumed that the crew was there to make adjustments to the resort rooms, yet very little of the original structure was touched. Instead, the work-crew erected large black sheets above the resort as if they were trying to hide something from satellites.

The guards wouldn‚Äôt say a word to me and my cousin would never answer his phone. I was worried about what was happening on my grandfather‚Äôs property. I was also worried about the lengthening absence of any communication with my cousin.

What I truly should have worried about were the occupants of the new *Detox Zone*.

The sound of footsteps on gravel woke me up. It couldn‚Äôt have been more than half past five. The sun was barely up. Were it not for the light sleep from the stress, I wouldn‚Äôt have even woken up.

They were walking right by my window.

At first, I thought I was still half in dream, yet there were many of them and the sight of them quickly sobered me. Outside of my window, in a single file line, walked dozens of scientists. They wore clean lab coats and some of them even had spectacles, but they all had the complexion of corpses. The scientists were burnt beyond recognition.

With some, their flesh was merely seared, with others, it was charcoal black. None of them looked like they should be walking. Most of them looked like they shouldn‚Äôt be breathing.

Out of a sheer sense of disbelief, I rose from bed and peered closely from the window. I had hoped that the terrible state of the procession would have just been some sinister trick of the light. It wasn‚Äôt. Not only were there charred corpses walking by my window, they were also looking back at me.

Some of them had eyes, most of them did not. None of them stopped. They all had their heads turned towards me but they still walked on in their single file line. It was only the last scientist of the procession that properly acknowledge me.

The man‚Äôs eyeballs were shriveled, but I could not help but meet them. With a long, charred finger he tapped on the glass. And then, with something that resembled a furrowed brow, he shook his head.

I hid in my cottage until I was sure he was gone. Then, as quickly as humanly possible, I raced to my car and drove off to the city.

I tried, desperately, to get ahold of my cousin. His phone was off. When I went to the hotel he used to stay at whenever he had business in the city the receptionist said she had not seen him in months.

I called Batima. She met me a couple hours later at a caf√© in the center.

She still had a couple hooks in her, but most of her jewelry was gone. Batima was muted, and not soon after we sat down, she explained why. She had heard things about my cousin through the grapevine. Most likely he had lost more than money in his hair product deal.

Batima presumed the reason why I wanted to meet was because of my cousin. Though the confirmation of my fears stung, the events of the morning were much more pressing. Lowering my voice in an effort to contain my sanity, I told her about the burnt scientists.

She listened without any judgement. Even when I talked about the charred cadaver tapping on my window, her face didn‚Äôt twitch. She simply nodded, smoked her cigarettes and took long sips of coffee whenever I struggled for words.

‚ÄòI presume your opinion on the stories of what happens in the forest has changed,‚Äô she finally said, when my terrible tale concluded.

I nodded.

‚ÄòYou aren‚Äôt the only one,‚Äô she said, as she finished off her coffee. ‚ÄòWe made some good money with the *Detox Zone*. I would suggest you take that money and move away from the property as soon as possible. You can‚Äôt enjoy that money when you‚Äôre dead. You can‚Äôt enjoy that money when you‚Äôre living near the “í—ã–ª—ã–º–∏ “õ–æ–Ω–¥—ã—Ä“ì—ã.‚Äô

The name of that terrible place once again crackled in the wind. I did not need Batima‚Äôs advice to convince me. All her words did was assure me that I am not insane.

I spent the next week in the city, taking a room in the hotel where my cousin once lived. For the first few days, I made more attempts at calling him yet his phone remained off. Eventually, I made peace with the likelihood of him no longer being among the living.

After a week of hiding, in the middle of the day, I made the drive back to my grandfather‚Äôs property. I was not planning on spending the night, or any extended amount of time in the cottage. All I wanted to do was to gather my belongings so that I would never need to see the place again.

I, however, was not welcome. The mute guards met my car well before I entered the property. They said nothing and let the tips of their rifles draw all conclusions. I did not argue. I did not try to make my way back to the cottage to gather my belongings.

I did not try to make my way back to the cottage, for it was burnt to the [ground](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/).",10,1730062440.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

at the beginning when he was trying to win me over he sent me multiple gifts of things he thought i‚Äôd like or even things i said i was saving up to buy. i loved it i felt seen. when he met in person for the first time after knowing each other a month i spent the night and he bought me my favorite candy and drink to make me more comfortable. he took me on a proper date and took me to meet his friends and family. they were all inviting, non-judgment, good people who i enjoy being around. it made me feel like finally this is the man i‚Äôve been looking for. this is the life i‚Äôve been hoping for! 

when i had to leave to go back home he cried bc he knew he‚Äôd miss me and wasn‚Äôt sure when we‚Äôd get to see each other again. we‚Äôd get on discord every night play games, watch movies together, we‚Äôd talk for hours without it ever feeling forced or boring. from the start he made it clear to me that he‚Äôs a relationship kind of man, that he wants something serious. we‚Äôre in our mid 20‚Äôs and that is rare now a days so it was music to my ears. he was good at communicating, reassurance, the whole 9 yards, the perfect package. 

I learned that he was struggling with an addiction to alcohol and that he was slowly getting better and his parents said that he has shown a lot of improvement. he gained this addiction from his last relationship where his ex was mentally abusive and then came to find out that she was cheating on him and that‚Äôs what made him leave. I was also cheated on in my last relationship and we bonded over this. as long as he was actively trying to recover I was willing to put in the work that it would take to help him through this as he seems worth it and like an amazing man. 

we talked about our core beliefs that made us who we are and goals in life and everything aligned perfectly and he told me he knows it‚Äôs soon but hopes i‚Äôd be down to move in within the next few months. i didn‚Äôt see there being anything that pointed at this being a bad idea and agreed to it. from that point on he bought things for the apartment to make it more of a home. he had the typical male apartment tv on the floor, no table, no decor, etc he bought and built all this furniture and was checking in to make sure they were things i liked style wise. 

once i moved i had to leave my job and it took me months to find a new one. we already discussed that we would be splitting the rent and that he would be paying for utilities while I pay for groceries. and any personal bills such as phone bills we pay our own I agreed to this as it sound it reasonable. during the time that I was unemployed I love to cook so I was cooking and I was also cleaning I believe he got too comfortable with the idea of me doing that so once I did get a job all that was still on me which was causing me to become exhausted. I eventually broke down and told him how I could not continue to work full-time and do all the work at home too. he was nice about it and said that he understood and heard me and since then has done things such as takes out the trash or does the dishes when he notices those things need to be done. he did admit to me that he hates laundry and I said that I would continue to do that. 

but I‚Äôve noticed since I‚Äôve moved here he doesn‚Äôt buy me gifts anymore. she doesn‚Äôt put an effort in planning dates. or spends any real time with me. usually when we go out it is with his friends and sometimes they bring their girlfriends to other times I‚Äôm the only girlfriend there and I feel kind of like I‚Äôm intruding even though no one makes me feel that way. we‚Äôre also beginning to get stuck in this rut that many may say is the honeymoon phase has ended. he‚Äôs a gamer and he will come home and immediately get on his game and will remain on the game until he goes to bed. 

at first this was fine because I was tired from work and I also enjoy my alone time. I enjoy that we were doing our own thing but in the same room. he still kisses me and hugs me and complements me all the time. but I‚Äôm starting to feel lonely. i‚Äôm starting to wish that he would plan dates for us. I myself have tried to make plans for the two of us to do together and he can never follow through with making those plans happen. and I don‚Äôt want to beg him to go to these places with me. A good example is there is a movie in theaters that I wanted to see and I mentioned it to him and asked if he would go see it with me on a certain day. he agreed to it but then the day came around and he didn‚Äôt mention anything to me and I assumed that he forgot because when I got home he was on his game. 

i‚Äôll admit I probably should‚Äôve said something to him but I hate having to do that and I‚Äôve already mentioned it before recently like within the same week. another example is he told me about this hiking trail around here and said that he would take me on it because it‚Äôs beautiful. I like that kind of stuff and I agree that I would like to go on it but this is back during summer and I said that I would like to go in the fall when it‚Äôs cooler out and the leaves have changed. he agreed to this and fall came around and I asked him would you like to go on this day. he agreed again and then the day comes and he‚Äôs made plans to go out with his friends. he always invites me to come with him as well as his friends have even said they want me to come. 

I decided to stay home that day because I had work the next morning and I tried to not let it get to me but I was a bit bummed out but I knew there‚Äôs still time to go and see the leaves changing over the mountains on this hike. I love his friends as I‚Äôve said but sometimes I wish it was just me and him. and I‚Äôve noticed the times that we have gone out together alone there‚Äôs not much conversation between us I‚Äôll try to initiate it and it‚Äôs just very bland which is not how it was in the beginning at all I don‚Äôt know where the lack of interest has gone. 

what really set me off to write this post was that our anniversary was a few days ago. I asked him about two weeks ago if he wanted to go out before our actual anniversary where it would be more convenient for us because the anniversary was on a weekday and we both worked. that day came and he woke up very sick and I had started my period and we mutually agreed that we didn‚Äôt feel like going out. he then texted me a day or so later while he was at work and said that he would like to go to this place for our anniversary this coming up weekend. I said that would be great and then I‚Äôm looking forward to it. well the weekend comes and he seems to forget about it as his mom invites us to dinner and he agrees to go so I asked him if he forgot about her anniversary he didn‚Äôt say yes or no instead just tells me that I need to tell his mom we‚Äôre not coming if we‚Äôre not gonna go because we‚Äôve blown his mom off for dinners for the past month and he felt bad.

I told him no will go to his moms dinner but it did bother me I read online that men don‚Äôt really think of anniversaries the way that women do and don‚Äôt see them as important. I like to think of myself as a very open minded and understanding person so I was understanding to see the other side where men don‚Äôt see it as is important. I could understand if it was our second or third fourth anniversary but this is our first year anniversary and to me that was very important. but this happening led me to a realization that we have basically been coexisting for the past few months and it‚Äôs starting to feel more like we‚Äôre roommates and in a relationship. 

at some point money was hard and I was understanding of it but you don‚Äôt have to have money to spend time with your significant other. I feel like less of a priority to him than his friends are. I feel like he would rather be spending time with them whether it be on the game or in person and spending time with me and that makes me feel as if I‚Äôm boring to him. I brought that to his attention and he reassured me that he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm boring but that he does think that sitting there watching TV with me is. I didn‚Äôt even recommend doing that he just assumes that there‚Äôs nothing else we could do and I am actually hoping that someone might have an answer on what we could do because I also didn‚Äôt know how to respond to him because I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to do myself. 

we did used to play games together but I‚Äôm not the biggest gamer as I like to play more cozy games that you don‚Äôt play with other people but could such as Minecraft in Elden ring. well he tends to be someone who plays games that involves multiple other people playing with you at the same time. even when we would play Elden or Minecraft he would usually invite a friend or two to play with us I didn‚Äôt mind sometimes but other times I would want it to have just been us. 

I tried to communicate this to him and he basically shut down and didn‚Äôt seem to see the problem. he apologized for not taking me out for the anniversary and not taking me on the hike the way he said he would. but the thing is we had time before his parents dinner he could‚Äôve taken me on that hike or at least to get a coffee and to walk around downtown. it also bothers me that I cook dinner but we never eat together. he eats at his desk on his game and I usually eat in front of the TV. also noticed if he‚Äôs going to go somewhere or even if it‚Äôs just to go run to the store or run through a drive-through to get food I always want to go with him or he even asks me to go with him. and always thanks me for going with him too. I enjoy it because it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre getting to have our own little short time spent together. but if I‚Äôm going to go do that he chooses to stay at home playing his game which is started to bother me bc it‚Äôs very one sided. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm putting in more effort than he is by saying let‚Äôs go here let‚Äôs go there and other things. I also feel like him not remembering or following through with plans shows that he doesn‚Äôt want to do them. so I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm begging or making him do some thing that he doesn‚Äôt want to do when I feel like he should just naturally do these things and want too.

I ended up deciding to send him a text message instead of saying it in person because I can be sensitive and I cry easily and I feel like doing so can come off as manipulative, likely due to being told so in a past relationship. he left my text on read and we haven‚Äôt spoken about it when we saw each other later that day at home. he seemed upset and there was tension in the room. he ended up making it clear to me that this is usually when his relationships go south and that he hates that it‚Äôs happening with us. 

I don‚Äôt understand how if he‚Äôs aware that his relationships go south because he puts an effort in the beginning and then once he gets the girl he decides he doesn‚Äôt have to anymore and his lack of seemingly wanting to spend any form of time together. and I don‚Äôt understand why he isn‚Äôt putting an effort to make sure that that stopped happening in his relationships? It baffles me that the guy that I met in the beginning and the guy that I‚Äôm with now are the same but it‚Äôs so different. he‚Äôs at work right now and he could easily fix this by stopping by getting a cheap five dollar bouquet of flowers and some thing for us for dinner and apologizing and saying that he understands he made me feel like he doesn‚Äôt care but showing he does but I know when he comes home today that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs gonna happen and he‚Äôs just going to get on his game and act like there‚Äôs not a problem between us. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do because it seems like I can‚Äôt get through to him and I‚Äôm aware that you can‚Äôt get someone to change who doesn‚Äôt want to change you can‚Äôt get someone to see a problem who doesn‚Äôt want to see it. but I don‚Äôt want us to fall into this loveless relationship where I‚Äôm becoming resentful towards him for his lack of effort. I want for us to rekindle things and for things to be like they were again in the beginning. I want the spark back and I don‚Äôt know how to regain it and don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll even be reciprocated. 

it‚Äôs worse because since I‚Äôve moved away from home I really do not want to move back my home life was not good. I lived with my mom and stepdad who are addicts in a small house that also has my two younger siblings in it. they were very poor and always asking me for money. I didn‚Äôt like the town that they lived in, I didn‚Äôt have any friends, I didn‚Äôt like my job. we‚Äôre here where I live now I got a job that I like, I have started to become closer with his friends girlfriends, again I also like his friends, I like his family his mother treats me amazingly she hugs me, checks up on me weekly, she bought me gifts and taken me out to eat which is more than I ever got for my own mother. 

I think that I could have a very good life here and I could have a very good life with him but I know that eventually this lack of effort he puts in to our relationship is starting to get to me and will continue to do so if we can‚Äôt resolve it and will eventually lead to us ending. any advice is welcomed!

What better chance to post and see what I can find! I am always looking for new people to talk with, everyone is unique and interesting in their own ways. A bit about myself to start things off:

\* Have my bachelor of commerce, majoring in accounting. At this point I honestly do not know where I may end up at. I might stay at my current town in interior BC, or maybe I will end up in some city in Canada. Only the future will tell, but to be sure, I will not be leaving Canada anytime in the foreseeable future.

\* History is one of my favourite subject interests. Basically I just want to learn it all, regardless of time period or place. So if you have any good recommendations for well researched and sourced books, please let me know! Another lesser one is geology and paleontology, just really like rocks I guess. Even now, I seek out trails for geological formations, even if they may be a few hours away. So yeah, I really love rocks I guess, I even still have portions of my childhood rock collection.

\* Speaking of books, I have loved reading since I was young. Love it so much, I can stay up until 2am getting immersed in my book, which doesn't really help too much with work the next day. Recently I have started to read 30 - 45 minutes before bed to help unwind before I attempt to sleep.

\* Gaming is one of my main hobbies to fill my time when the weather isn't nice or I have nothing else to do. Personally I think gaming is best done with friends, so always done to play most things with people. Some current games I have been playing are: WoW, FFXIV, WH40K Rogue Trader, Crusader Kings 3, X4 Foundations, PokeRogue, Rimworld

\* When the weather is nice, and not winter, I love to go hiking and for long walks. Hopefully this upcoming spring and summer will be less smoke filled than last year. Would love to get into photography some day so I can capture all the scenic sights I see. Currently trying to get better at working out consistently, have been pretty good in the past but have fallen through a bit since I've moved.

\* Music is a big part of my life, and if my ear isn't taken by something I usually have it playing. I would say my preferred genres tend to be alt and indie rock. That being said, if I enjoy a song I will usually add it to my playlist, and check out the artist and similar songs to see if I can find others I will enjoy. Always love hearing about why a person loves a song, and am more than happy to exchange songs!

\* Love to cook and bake, and somewhat decent at it too! Always looking for new recipes to try. Usually I get them down after a few tries, well they are edible at least

\* I think I am decently humourous, I am able to make my co-workers and friends laugh quite a bit. Really I just want everyone to have a good time in the end and try my best to make it happen.

\* Communication is one of the things I value the most. Would love to find someone who is efficient as well, as I truly believe it is key to growing any sort of relationship.

I can be quite an open book and love talking to people, so if this interests you in all feel free to reach out!",1,1730061765.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

We broke up 7 weeks ago, he initiated the breakup. The situation around it is very messy and complex. I have severe mental health issues, I don't have any official diagnosis as I'm still being assessed by a new psychiatrist I'm seeing but it's suspected I have a mood type disorder like bipolar or borderline personality disorder or schizoaffective. We were together for 6 months, and two months before our breakup I had what I now understand is a manic episode. At the time I was working at a strip club, with his knowledge and consent, however I had previously had a long depressive episode and was struggling with substance abuse issues and ptsd from a previous relationship that ended less than a year ago that was physically, sexually and mentally abusive. Whilst I was manic I was engaging in much more reckless drug usage, not sleeping, had this need to constantly seek out stimulation and was overall reckless and not in my right mind and going towards dangerous situations like it was nothing. I became friendly with this girl at the club who also worked as an escort, she was 20 years older than me and offered me free drugs and alcohol and ""fun vibes"" and an offer to make more money than I'd ever make just working at the club. I mainly hung out with her first for the drugs and because to my manic brain it all seemed fun and crazy and exciting. She invited me to join her on a new plan she had where she'd host private parties at her house, and she'd sleep with the men but I only had to host and dance and talk and look sexy basically. I got swept up by the delusions of grandeur and the promise of financial security and free drugs and she just built this fantasy that with my limited capacity of rational thinking I just went fuck it and did as I was told. I didn't originally set out to perform any sexual acts for anyone, my boyfriend at the time would not have been comfortable with any of it, but in the moment I found myself just going along with more. I understand it now as a fawn response that occurs as a result of my ptsd, especially as I have a lot of sexual trauma. 

I deceived my boyfriend and didn't tell him anything like I should have done and he found out online from a post I'd made. He was understandably extremely hurt and didn't understand how I could have ended up in that position and why I didn't tell him anything so he broke up with me. I spiralled out shortly after, took some drugs and ended up at a&e where I was put under the care of a mental health crisis team. My symptoms of psychosis got noticeably worse and I was catatonic depressed for almost two weeks I think up until I was started on a mood stabiliser/antipsychotic medication. This medication has been lifesaving and i feel like an actual normal functioning person now. I've been discharged from the crisis team and on the medication for four weeks now and I've committed myself to abstinence of all substances and been drug free for a month and alcohol free for two weeks. 

I reached out to my ex, apologised a second time and offered to give an explanation on everything if he wanted to hear it. He responded that same day saying he was actually thinking about Mr that day and of messaging me to check how I was doing. He heard out my explanation and I told him everything about my mental health, the dubious consent and feeling taken advantage of, and everything else really. He explained he understands what happened was ""not really your fault"" (his own words, however I completely disagree with any implication that I was not still behaving irresponsibly and I'm still to be held accountable for my choices from the very start of my mental health and addiction spiral were my responsibility and its still my responsibility to avoid a relapse), but that what really hurt him was the part where I didn't tell him the truth of what happened to me sooner and he had to find out through a post I made online. 

I've felt nothing but remorse and deep shame about everything I put him through and I never expected him to even want to talk to me again or even respond to my message. I then decided to flat out just ask him if he would ever consider rekindling the relationship at any point, as I still love him and I felt I needed to put it out there so at least I don't have any regrets in the future or can get proper closure from the relationship if his answer was a straight no. He responded saying he was 50/50 about it, that maybe he would consider it in the future once I've gone through my treatments and recovery and that he misses ne and has considered giving me a second chance but right now is trying to move on with his life and he thinks I shouldn't worry about him and just focus on myself. I accepted this and we resumed to being in no contact for about a week or two I think? However his response actually led me to feel more confused and stressed. I had told him really clearly that I needed to receive a clear rejection in order for me to move on if that's also what he wanted, but his response felt like he wasn't saying yes but wasn't saying no either and I was torn between hanging on to potentially false hope or moving on which felt impossible without a clear rejection as my feelings for him are very strong. I broke the no contact first and sent him a message explaining why I wasn't comfortable actually accepting an answer that vague to a question that requires a bit more certainty and that I felt a lot of confusion about his actual intentions and feelings towards me particularly in the case of if he woke up someday and decided that he'd want to get back together with me. It made me feel a bit like he just wanted to keep me as an option open to him but wasn't willing to put any serious commitment into starting a relationship again. And I also addressed the topic of recovery and how I felt it was a bit unrealistic to hold anyone with my special needs to a ""if you recover to this level you are worthy of love and support"" whereas I think recovery is a never-ending active process you choose and anyone who wants to be in your life should feel able to and want to support you through the fluctuating highs and lows (obviously so long as I maintain I won't cross any boundaries or hard lines ever again and keep myself accountable). I asked him again if he could please give me a clear rejection if he has no intention to salvage this relationship as I felt the vagueness of it was weighing on my mind too much and starting to affect me in a negative way.

He responded the next day to this message saying he could see how his previous message comes across like he's trying to get away with rejecting me without actually rejecting me and keeping me open as an option, but that he genuinly didn't intend for it to come across that way. He said he did mean it when he said he'd be open to getting back together and that he hasn't moved on from me still but he did need time and space to process his feelings. He also said he didn't mean to place an expectation on me that I needed to recover fully for him, but that he thought that I was trying to say in our previous conversation that I wanted time too to work on myself and my recovery for a while. He ended it saying he'd be more than willing to meet up for a coffee and talk in person and that he hasn't lost hope in us. 

However his behaviour is still reassembling someone who I'm assuming it's because he must still be processing everything and feeling quite hurt? I asked him what day would be good for him and he gave me a day and time but then the day before he cancelled, partly he said because he thought he might have caught a bug but also he added that he wasn't sure if he was ready still. I told him to take his time and to let me know when he felt more ready and asked to check in with me if it's been more than a couple weeks so we can see where we're at and if us meeting up is still gonna happen. I noticed he had left my message on read. A couple days later he messaged me out the blue telling me he does still want to meet btw but things are very stressful at his work right now and it will be super busy during the half term. I wished him well and good luck during that and that I'll be okay and keep busy and to just focus on him. A day later I asked him if he'd be open to maybe setting a specific date again but sometime after half term so it's long after the busy period for him has passed but he's left me on delivered for 5 days now. I've been trying to justify it being understandable because he did warn me he would be bust, but I can't help but also feel a bit let down that he's ignoring me completely now. But I also feel bad that I may be asking him for too much, because I think its probably he just need some more space. I've tried to include as much as I can but I would really be curious if anyone can tell me what they're seeing is happening here.",1,1730061631.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

So I have been busy with my bachelor's dissertation and I haven't had the time to prepare at all and my exposure mostly comes from video games and tv. Anyways here goes

Speaking: Showed up super nervous as I didn't get any sleep the day before, my examiner was super friendly, part 1 went pretty basic, part 2 I was given a cue ""have you helped a family member recently, how"" I struggled with this as I don't really stay in touch with my family a lot so I decided to make up a story, I guess I was short 30 seconds or so and was asked to speak some more, in part 3, I accidentally slipped in a native language (Hindi) word while giving an example and was mortified, fumbling the rest of my answers a little, being repetitive and such. In general I think I was using a lot of informal phrases like ""you know"" ""like"" so I think that might've been a minus

Listening: Not much to say here, I had an hour long break between speaking and lrw and I had a smoke and a coffee and was worried I would shit myself haha, it felt easy I was only worried about map based questions but luckily none showed up

Reading: I am very used to reading a lot of research papers so this went by super quick, took 20 minutes and I slept for the rest of it, passages were of a scientific nature mostly, had variety of questions here like summarise fill in the blanks, true/false/not given (gave me most trouble) and titling and the basic mcqs

Writing: the invigilator woke me up, task 1 I think I spent a little too much time and got a little too wordy, ended at 260 words, tried to use interesting phrases here which was probably detrimental to my score haha, task 2 prompt was ""should juvenile criminals be given same punishments as adults for serious crimes"" I introduced the writing, part 2 I stated my position (no) and justified it with one aspect, part 3 another aspect of my position, part 3 an opposing view and it's denial, and concluded by stating that opposing views don't hold a strong enough basis etc.

I‚Äôve been isolated, struggling to make friends, and haven‚Äôt really clicked with any of my coworkers. Well, that was until I became friendly with him 23M pretty quickly after starting. However, I believe my friendship with him may be morphing, but it‚Äôs complicated. I‚Äôm not sure if emotional affairs can be one sided, but I really didn‚Äôt mean to be in this mess. Maybe I‚Äôm ignorant, but here‚Äôs my side of the story. I‚Äôll give more context. 

I have a poor track record with platonic male friendships. I tend to approach them as I would my female friendships. I‚Äôm supportive, talk about feelings, gossip a bit, you know the drill. I have learned that my approach to friendship cannot stay platonic for most men. So generally, I avoid perusing friendships with them altogether. However, I felt comfortable doing so with this guy because he talked frequently about his girlfriend. He‚Äôs taken and in a committed LDR, so it would stay platonic‚Ä¶ right? Well now I‚Äôm not sure. 

Here‚Äôs the deal, I‚Äôm about to describe what felt like very slow progression. It started like many other coworker type friendships. Coffee and get togethers in public locations. We slowly learned more about each other, and slowly lost all sense of professionalism. I was comfortable with this because I needed a friend and felt that his LDR was secure. What started as relating over work, turned to sharing little secrets about ourselves. Nothing crazy, just funny stories about our lives. Then he began inviting me over to his place, we‚Äôd watch TV and have a glass of wine. This became almost a weekly thing, which is odd in hindsight but I felt reassured by the fact he was taken. 

This is when the lines started to blur for me. Naturally, our conversations slowly got deeper. They seemed like my typical conversations with female friends! But my perspective shifted once he started to tell me negative things about relationship. I saw him questioning his LDR as a red flag, but not a deal breaker. He‚Äôs basically my only friend here so I really reallyyyy didn‚Äôt want to distance myself. That may be biting me in the ass now. 

Now, he regularly compares me to his girlfriend, but only in the ways I‚Äôm ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. Here‚Äôs the kicker‚Ä¶ he hides me from her. I‚Äôm something they argue about and I didn‚Äôt realize that until very recently. This is where I was sure we had a problem. But then, just when I want to distance myself, he‚Äôll say something to reassure me of our platonically. Then he‚Äôs take it another step, he complimented my appearance for the first time a few weeks ago. And you know what it was‚Ä¶ my SMILE ffs. It‚Äôs like we keep progressing and he‚Äôll sprinkle in comments to deny it. I want to believe his denials, because how fcking  awkward would it be if this guy i work with tried to make a move. 

Here are a few of my theories:
1. I‚Äôm crazy, he‚Äôs just a friend.
2. He has feelings for me, and wants to peruse them in secret (AKA see if I‚Äôll help him have a physical/emotional affair). 
3. He has feelings for me and doesn‚Äôt know what to do with them, but still can‚Äôt help himself. 
4. He wants to break up with his LDR and is trying to set me up as a rebound.

1gdka70,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdka70,First Family Cruise: How we were Serenaded by RC,"Kids club. That was my sole reason for booking a cruise. My partner and I thought we‚Äôd try it, enjoy a bit of respite from looking after our young children, and just grit our teeth and try to embrace the rest. 

After weeks of research (thanks Reddit hive mind!) I chose a small ship (Serenade OTS) sailing from Tampa for a 5nt cruise to Mexico. We booked a balcony room and then put in a generous Royal Up bid for a 2 bedroom owners, which we were lucky enough to win.

Well, after our first night we knew we were going to love it. The embarkation was seamless, the ship was as tastefully kitsch as I‚Äôd hoped - late 90s vibes all around - and the crowd of mostly witty Floridian retirees was warm and welcoming. It was like cruising with the Golden Girls!

The food was far better than feared. The windjammer never disappointed nor felt over-crowded as there was masses of seating - we often chose the aft outdoor area and had the whole space to ourselves. Bar the desserts, everything was good or great. We especially loved the Indian night, the salmon en croute and the vegan meatloaf. 

We ate at Izumi one night and, meh, I wouldn‚Äôt rush back. Excellent service but it‚Äôs just the lunch menu with two entrees, which is more than anyone needs! I love sashimi but unfortunately theirs is pre-frozen - I understand why this is necessary but it affects the texture/taste a lot. Ramen was good though. 

The best part of the whole experience was the sheer amount of empty / quiet space on the ship. I assumed it was a half-empty cruise but was told by numerous staff and guests that it was almost fully-booked. 

Whilst the kids were at Adventure Ocean we strolled all around the ship. In the mornings, Vortex nightclub, was like the vast set of an early 00s movie: all chrome and purple; Schooner Bar‚Äôs acres of parquet and lacquered wood finishes always felt warm and calm; access to the empty helipad from deck 5 was incredible and the random 90s collectibles all over the ship (Harrison Ford‚Äôs bow tie from his role in ‚ÄòSabrina‚Äô, prints of a girly Alicia Silverstone and, my personal favourite, Fiona Shaw in a toga, grasping an eagle) all provided an amusing, nostalgic buzz. 

The musicians and singers too, were far better than I‚Äôd imagined. With toddlers our evenings out are currently on hold, but during our 5 days we enjoyed big band tunes, piano bar sing-alongs and got to give the kids their first taste of a theatre show (and when they squirmed too much after 15mins, it was painless to get up and leave - we had not paid Broadway prices). 
Some had warned there wasn‚Äôt enough to do on the ship, but we did more in 5 days than during most months on land: climbing, mini-golf and splashing about in the kids pool were daily activities which we enjoyed together knowing our room (or some food) was minutes away should the kids get over-tired or hungry. 

The kids asked to go to Adventure Ocean every day - they were so well looked after there, and always came back with crafts they‚Äôd made. The family bingo was another highlight - just a simple 30 minutes but it was so much fun to see the kids learn the game and win prizes for their efforts. 

It was pleasing to see the huge gym given a prime location on the ship. I enjoyed a sunrise from the treadmill and the jogging track was an easy way to get extra steps in. It was reassuring to see other guests doing the same. In fact, it felt like less than a quarter of the guests were there just to overindulge on food and booze - something else I‚Äôd wrongly assumed was the norm.

The service was incredible. Everyone was working so hard to give us a great holiday. It‚Äôs an uneasy feeling knowing their hours, low pay (by US standards) and how many have left young family at home. It was great to see RC acknowledging the staff at the flag ceremony, and I only saw guests being respectful to them. I hope this was always the case.
We knew we‚Äôd not have time to see the ‚Äòreal‚Äô Mexico but it was exciting to get a taster. We did Hayhu beach club from Costa Maya which was good. 

The suite perks weren‚Äôt enough to make me want to book one again. The concierge lounge was full of mostly unhappy looking people; the least friendly on the ship in fact. It was nice to indulge in a cocktail once or twice at happy hour but we aren‚Äôt really drinkers. The breakfast at Chops Grille was the only place with less-than-great service, we opted for windjammer most days. We never wanted to eat in our room so didn‚Äôt do the room service. I now understand what people mean when they say that you really don‚Äôt spend a lot of time in the room.

We went to the MDR once. The food was good and the service excellent but the ambiance was draining - it felt like a huge conference centre with tables cheek-by-jowl. I really don‚Äôt know why people bother with it, maybe if I were in a big, child-free group and dressing up for dinner together was part of the experience..? But to forfeit eating in the sea air watching a sunset on deck just feels wrong. 

What else? The coffee at Cafe Lattitudes was ok, but they didn‚Äôt do proper flat whites (just huge milky lattes). It was the Lavazza coffee machine in our room which was the best tasting. I wouldn‚Äôt buy the coffee card next time. 

I‚Äôve been told that Oasis Class is incredible but Radiance Class has more than enough for us, and a quick embarkation is golden. I love the look of the ship in the dock, she‚Äôs modest and classic. She was well maintained despite her age: nothing felt neglected and we saw maintenance teams in various areas throughout the cruise. For me, the thought of being on a ship with 3000+ guests, even if it‚Äôs double the size, is very claustrophobic. Though, I really can‚Äôt believe that there‚Äôs more free space per passenger on the newer ships. They are designed to make more and more money and unused space does not do that. 

Anyway, thanks RC for a wonderful cruise. I‚Äôll be recommending it to all parents of kids 3+ from now on (and boring them senseless with the details of our experience). We‚Äôre thinking of a Europe cruise next time but.. will it be the same without the Golden Girls?",25,1730060508.0,royalcaribbean,4,0.9,False

**TEENS** *(and adults in their lives)*: Visit Central (10 W 14th Ave Parkway) on **Sunday, November 3** 10 am-4 pm for the grand opening of Central's Teen Library! We will have a set from Denver's own up & coming [DJ Dopewave](https://303magazine.com/2021/10/meet-dj-dopewave-the-kid-dj-riding-the-waves-of-kaytranada/), DIY project garage, videogames (PC, Xbox, Switch, Metaquest VR), boardgames, card games, study spaces, hangout spaces, and *more* that we hope to add with *your* help (yes, you)! We dream of this space being somewhere Denver's entire teen community can feel safe, belong, be themselves, and have ownership & influence on where we are going. A very talented team is ready to work with you on making your ideas a reality -- no shushing, no adults up in your business (unless you're like, *really* up in theirs), you can even curse -- just don't be mean/hateful! 

**EDUCATORS/PARENTS** We are also looking for youth-made art works to display within our new space and encourage others to create -- if you happen to have any young artists age 13-19 in your life with displayable artworks (all mediums, sizes welcome!), just shoot me a PM. Interested in coming to check things out with your group? Again, please PM. 

**TL;DR** -- Come to Central Library's grand reopening on November 3, 10 am-4 pm, 10 W 14th Ave Parkway -- there will be all kinds of exciting things happening for all ages (including teens!)

I do not get any compensation for sharing & am just passionate about getting info out through every channel possible. Many thanks again for this sub's help in making that happen.**",4,1730060229.0,Denver,0,0.84,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",3,1730060228.0,Soulnexus,0,1.0,False

So my 3yo toddler has never been so social. He is the type that gets close to one/two kids in daycare and is not that interested in the big groups. I blamed that on the personality as I could remember the same patterns in my childhood. 

Today, I took him to a coffee place that had a very nice playground. He loves slides and all and I entered the playground together with him so he can feel more confortable. Well, he did not want to do anything without me, like he did not want to go on the slide which he loves and everytime another child was getting close to us, he was coming very close to me while saying ‚Äúmama, a child is coming‚Äù. He was reacting the same on kids younger than him. We ended up sitting at the table together while he was only observing the playground. He explicitly said that he does not want to go on the playground.

I am a bit unsure how to approach this and how to give him a boost to open up to other kids and become a bit more independent. On top of this, I am ngl, I am a bit concerned as well.",1,1730060161.0,toddlers,2,1.0,False
