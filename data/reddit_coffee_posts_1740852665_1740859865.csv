I've been talking to this guy for almost a year now and we finally met. For me it was a good first meeting as I am someone who is incredibly shy and it does take me a while to get comfortable.

We met at a mall, he did some shopping for himself, we had a nice cup of coffee, we chatted and then we went our separate ways. Even though he has seen me prior on video calls and pictures but I was still nervous about him not liking how I looked.

Anyway, he was nothing but sweet to me, he ordered for me and paid, he made sure I was comfortable even though I was a nervous wreck. I was really shy and I feel like it showed.

I also did one stupid thing but I realised it when I got back home. We were just sitting and comparing our phones so he cutely took his phone case off and put it on mine and gave my phone back to me. He was smiling and asked how it look. I SAID IT LOOKS NICE BUT IT'S TOO LEMONY..LEMONY?! then I proceeded to give his case back to him üòÖ he was looking directly at me, I got nervous and I fumbled. He's probably thinking I hated the case or the gesture. Which I didn't but I realised that his phone case was expensive and it wouldn't have been okay to just take it üò≠

We left on a good note and 15 minutes after we left he texted me 'Thank you for today.' I obviously was elated. I thanked him for the coffee and told him I had a wonderful time. He said that he did too. Then I made a funny comment like 'Really? I didn't scare you?' then he told me that I couldn't scare anyone because I was nice and sweet.

We had a bit of small talk after that and we haven't talked since. It's been 2 days now.

So um, all I want to know is.. do you think he liked me? Or was he just being polite with the texts.",2,1740859710.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1j18hce,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j18hce/if_you_match_with_someone_on_a_dating_app/,If you match with someone on a dating app...,"For the love of God - have a conversation before asking to meet for coffee! I just unmatched another man I matched because he immediately asked to meet me - this was before he even asked me a single question. He send me a rose on Hinge - which I guess you have to pay for. So I thanked him. Immediately asked to go for coffee. I explained that for both our sakes, we need to have a conversation first, whether on text or a quick call. I'm not a fan of endless texting or calling either - but like common! Even if we had one conversation I would have been more at ease and he would've been less desperate looking. 

Talking to someone is important to ensure you are looking for the same things. I've had conversations for example where the guy wants to have kids and I don't or the man is super duper political and I'm not 0 and we don't waste each others time. Other times guys are looking for something casual (nothing wrong with that) but that's not for me. We simply end on a good note. 

So after I say we need to have some convo first, the guy talks about himself, tells me I'm beautiful then sends a message saying it would have been the perfect day for coffee because he doesn't have his kids this weekend but that I don't want to do that. Never mind that I have plans - I was ruining it for him by having a simple boundary. I immediately unmatched!

Ladies and gentleman - please, start with a convo, batter, and a quick phone call before demanding to see someone in person! I know it's a bit of effort but I promise you - it will pay off.",1,1740859684.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

In the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling through subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. Some helped temporarily, many didn‚Äôt. I was drowning in productivity p\*rn while being completely unproductive.

This is when I discovered habit stacking, and while I had some success with it, something just wasn‚Äôt clicking.  I abandoned most habits after a week or two, which made me think I was doing something wrong. That's when I realised the missing piece: every habit has an invisible energy barrier - an ""activation energy threshold"" that must be overcome to start it. Some existing habits drain your energy (like doing dishes), while others give you a tiny energy boost (like that first sip of coffee).

The secret to successful habit stacking isn't just pairing any two habits - it's matching a new, difficult habit (high activation energy) with an existing habit that either:

1. Gives you a small energy boost, or
2. Requires almost no energy to complete

**My failed habit stack:** ""After doing the dishes, I'll write the three main tasks I needed to get done for the day"".  
**Why it failed**: Doing the dishes already requires activation energy. I was trying to climb two hills back-to-back.

**My successful stack**: ""After I take my first sip of morning coffee, I'll write down the three main tasks I needed to get done for the day.""   
**Why it worked**: That first sip of coffee is not only effortless but gives me a tiny pleasure hit. I'm leveraging that little dopamine boost to overcome the activation barrier for writing down the tasks. 

I applied this same principle to exercise - instead of ""after work, I'll go to the gym"" (stacking on something draining), I tried ""after I put my keys on the hook when I get home, I'll immediately change into workout clothes."" The act of hanging keys requires almost zero energy, making it easier to initiate the next step. Within weeks, I was consistently working out 3-4 times a week.

I'm not saying I've got it all figured out - some days still suck. But understanding this ""activation energy"" component of habit stacking has been the difference between temporary motivation and actual lasting change. If you've tried habit stacking before and failed, maybe give it another shot with this threshold concept in mind. Pay attention to which of your existing habits give you energy versus draining it, then stack accordingly. Anyway, just wanted to share since this and hope it helps you!

1j18eog,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1j18eog/the_barrier/,The Barrier,"Well I don‚Äôt know. Last night I went out, honestly I had no purpose. The purpose I was supposed to have was to find a girl to share one night of intimacy with, but I question if I even want that. Don‚Äôt get me wrong of course I would love nothing more than to hook up with an attractive girl but for some reason, sometimes I just have that barrier. I want to think we all come across that barrier at one point, at least I do quite frequently. That voice in your head telling you what not to do, and the potential consequences and outcomes of your actions. You spend the whole moment thinking about the moment, and before you know it the moment is gone. Alcohol was supposed to be my cure for the barrier last night, in fact I use it as my cure every night I go out, sometimes I don‚Äôt even use it as a cure, just as a precautionary step to attempt to break the barrier before I hit it. Though this morning, or rather afternoon now I suppose, I am not hungover whatsoever, and I didn‚Äôt meet any woman to fornicate with, in fact I can say I honestly didn‚Äôt try. It wasn‚Äôt just an ‚Äúoh i‚Äôm too cool to try and get women they try to get me‚Äù, it was an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared to pursue these women and I don‚Äôt want to look like an idiot so I might as well completely avoid them all together‚Äù. That was the barrier talking. I‚Äôm lucky enough to be a fairly attractive man, it wasn‚Äôt always that way, I put in effort to go to the gym, started caring about my skin and my hair, and began to dress nicely. I‚Äôve also been blessed with the genetic attributes of being 6 foot 3‚Äù and having blue eyes with dirty blonde hair. Yes I know I sound silly and stupid, and there might be a lot of people reading this thinking, ‚Äúfuck this guy he has it all, he has no reason to complain about women‚Äù, and yes they might be right but I‚Äôm gonna complain anyways. I suppose I lack confidence, although there is confidence there, but just the unearned confidence of someone like me. It‚Äôs only been for around a year that I've actually noticed women coming on to me when I go out and actually making an effort to interact with me. This is appreciated and I'm still not used to it. There have been times when women have made out with me and given me attention and that‚Äôs all it takes for me to fall for them. I‚Äôm not great at making my own moves, that‚Äôs the barrier's fault. 

My two best friends at university are both in relationships and I‚Äôm always complaining that they don't wingman me. They went out with me last night and offered their services on a silver platter. They both looked at me as we had our meeting in the crowded lounge full of girls and guys all drinking, socializing, and they said ‚Äúpick a girl, we‚Äôve got you‚Äù. You know what I did, I stood there thinking about it, scanned the room, and just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt wrong in saying that, I wasn‚Äôt really picking a girl when I scanned the room, I was just looking at all the people talking in their groups, having fun, and I thought, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing I can bring to this conversation, these people don‚Äôt want to talk to me‚Äù. The barrier strikes once again, I definitely could have picked a girl and walked up with my two friends who I'm comfortable with, placed ourselves within her little group, and who knows what could‚Äôve happened, thanks to the barrier we will never know, I will never know. 

Another large factor of the night was this one girl who I actually did like. I've liked her ever since my friend called her hot, as apparently that‚Äôs what sways my vote these days, the barrier, my obligation to care about what other people think about me. Now this girl, lets call her Buttercup, is a great girl, she‚Äôs pretty, has a good taste in music, and she has incredibly smooth, somewhat tanned skin. Coming into the school year Buttercup was just a pipe dream for me. I thought she was way out of my league, and I found it very intimidating to talk to her, the barrier. However after hearing my roommate repeatedly telling me ‚Äúshe ain‚Äôt even all that‚Äù I figured ‚Äúwhat the hell i‚Äôll try‚Äù. Now there‚Äôs this evil little app called snapchat and I started ‚Äúsnapping‚Äù her, sending dumb selfies back and forth. Eventually I started ‚Äúchatting‚Äù her I guess, just talking about school and what not typical talking stage stuff. The thing I quickly caught on to however was that it was always me sparking conversations and reaching out. The conversations we had were still good but I felt like I was just annoying her or something like a little puppy that wouldn‚Äôt leave her alone, this train of thought was likely the barriers doing. However our relationship took a huge step when she agreed to get coffee with me, the downside to this was that she chose the time and the place which was tim hortons 30 minutes before she had to go to class. We had a fine chat but she seemed to refuse to want to give me the privilege of taking her out on a proper date, like the movies, or even a walk of sorts, just something where I could actually talk to her, make a real connection, find out if we‚Äôre compatible, hell I don‚Äôt know maybe even make a move. 

Alas The closest I‚Äôve come to this opportunity was my bold move to sit next to her in class. We now have two hours a week, early in the morning, where I get the supposed luxury to talk to Buttercup, and be in her presence. This is still going on and there‚Äôs been classes where I was really on a roll with her, making her laugh, potentially building a connection, the peak is always on the three minute walk after class back to the residence, it‚Äôs just me and her walking and talking, it feels almost like a real date, exactly what I wanted, but I know it‚Äôs not want I want. I know because I‚Äôve texted her asking to hang out about 4-5 times now and each time I'm met with a maybe, I don‚Äôt know what it is that makes me keep going, blind courage, stupidity, loneliness, whatever it is, is really screwing me over. I want to date her, maybe she doesn‚Äôt want to date me, maybe she wants me to ask her out in person on a real date, and not just a text saying ‚Äúwanna hang out later‚Äù or ‚Äúwanna come over later‚Äù some of these texts are sent on the weekend when I‚Äôm already drunk, but I‚Äôve texted her sober at sober times and the answer‚Äôs always the same. maybe it‚Äôs too late, maybe it‚Äôs all the damn barrier. I guess I'll never truly know unless I ask her out in person directly with a proposition she can‚Äôt finagle her way out of, but then what am I risking, my reputation, the slight connection of maybe friendship that we‚Äôve made in class, I don‚Äôt know, but I do care. 

Tying this all back to last night, I saw Buttercup at the lounge party I was at, we crossed paths when I was heading back to my dorm to get more drinks, I said ‚Äúhi Buttercup how are you‚Äù she said hi back, I continued on my way, and she said ‚Äúsorry I didn‚Äôt really answer your question‚Äù I shouted back, already leaving the area ‚Äúit‚Äôs all good‚Äù. Fuck me, this person I have all these great conversations with in class is so awkward when we interact in a social setting outside of class with other people around, and I try not to be awkward, I always try, maybe that‚Äôs the problem. So I go back to my dorm to get more drinks, I tell my friends, ‚Äúhey you guys have to help me‚Äù and they, tired of seeing me torment myself over this girl for the past few months, gladly agree. Buttercup is always surrounded by her friends, I always thought it would‚Äôve been impossible to talk to her one on one, but then I get back to the lounge party, and I see her there, talking to a guy, just him and her, and Bang! I crashed right into the barrier. The worse thing is that I know this guy to, he fucks a new girl every weekend, and here he is with Buttercup, this girl I put on a pedestal, and she looks like she‚Äôs having a great time talking to him. Now i‚Äôve fully hit the barrier, in reality there‚Äôs nothing wrong with her talking to this guy, he deserves her, he actually went up and talked to her, this is just another weekend for him, and another girl, it‚Äôs all so easy for him, and I can tell she‚Äôs attracted to that, just the confidence of this guy drinking doing his thing. All this grinding against the barrier made me go back to the dorm once again and crash into my bed, like a boulder slamming into a lake, slowly sinking deeper and deeper, never to surface again. For a moment in that bed I thought to myself ‚Äúno‚Äù. I‚Äôve put in way too much work with this girl just to lose her so quickly and without even an effort on my part. So I walked back to that lounge party, but she had  stopped talking to that guy, my friends had looked out for me, they told him I was into her and he backed off like it was nothing. I didn‚Äôt even know if he was getting along well with Buttercup, but it didn‚Äôt matter to him, he just found another girl. It‚Äôs true what they say about university. 

It's easy to get girls if you can get past the barrier and just become yourself. Sadly now that the threat of Buttercup finding another man was gone, so was my motivation to talk to her, my friends tried to wingman me, they even went up and said hi to her, but it was no use, the barrier was still there, it‚Äôs always been there, so I didn‚Äôt talk to her for the rest of the night. I did text her later though, and asked her to smoke a joint with me, I don‚Äôt know why I sent it. Deep down from all the talks I'd had with her I knew she probably wasn‚Äôt even a smoker, with people you care about you can just tell. So she texts me back ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt smoke lol‚Äù. I‚Äôm thinking to myself ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs great, but now she thinks i‚Äôm a smoker‚Äù, which I am, but I don‚Äôt even like weed anymore, I just asked her because I thought maybe she‚Äôd find it cool, or some bullshit. So then I text her something like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, I just wanted a reason to hangout, and you aren‚Äôt really missing out on much, just getting high and watching star wars‚Äù. Gun to my mother‚Äôs head I didn‚Äôt clock in that I was kinda asking her to watch star wars with me with that statement, I just know she likes star wars and I wanted her to know that I like it too. So she replies with ‚ÄúEven if you had asked me to watch star wars, that would‚Äôve been sick but tbh (to be honest) I‚Äôm so very drunk right drunk rn (right now) so idk (I don‚Äôt know)‚Äù. Well hey there you have it, the finale blow signalling that i‚Äôm not going to see her. This is actually the second time she‚Äôs used the drunk line on me, and it‚Äôs a good excuse, of course I don‚Äôt want to see her if she‚Äôs really drunk, she knows it and I know it. The first time she used that line I texted back ‚Äúokay no worries, if you feel any better and want to hang out let me know‚Äù, this time I was in an extra bad mood after striking the barrier so many times that I just said a stupid joke ‚Äúdamn inviting you to watch star wars would‚Äôve been good, why didn‚Äôt I think of that, I‚Äôm so retarded‚Äù. What an idiot. So she waits until this morning to respond saying ‚ÄúIt still would‚Äôve depended on which one (which star wars movie) lol‚Äù and me in my more sober mind texts ‚ÄúI usually can‚Äôt just watch one I have to watch all 6 in order, but for you i‚Äôd play it safe and pick revenge of the sith‚Äù. She waits 2 hours and responds with a snap of her sticking her tongue out, a blatantly obvious disinterest in continuing a conversation with me. 

She obviously doesn‚Äôt like me but she‚Äôs too nice to shut me down and go through the awkward process of seeing each other in class after, I think she can keep it up until the end of the year but I can‚Äôt. I wish I could see her perspective on this relationship, I mean we‚Äôve been best friends on snap which means we interact with each other the most, but maybe my awkward avoidant personality caused by the barrier has made her think that I don‚Äôt like her, I mean it‚Äôs entirely possible a lot of people think I get lots of girls because of my height, she might just think i‚Äôm some fucking playboy. This is all just the barrier, the barrier isn‚Äôt just you, it‚Äôs your friends, family, the media, sociological values and norms that we feel we must follow and abide by. If I had to give any advice to the reader of this story, FUCK THE BARRIER, you just have to exist and not let intangible non existent factors prevent you from experiencing life, because life is all we have, every moment in your life is gone the second after it happens, there is no time to think about doing something you wanna do, just do it.

1j18ee8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1j18ee8/i_was_stunned_by_what_i_found_when_i_went_to_help/,I Was Stunned by What I Found When I Went to Help My Sick Friend,"Eeey, some of these women out here are lucky. Let me tell you why. 
So, this week, my friend has been unwell sick in bed, barely able to get up. She's been staying at my place because she didn't want to be alone. Now, I‚Äôve always been the type to help out when I can, so today I decided to pay her house a visit, clean up, and do whatever I could to make her life a little easier while she‚Äôs recovering. You know, basic friend stuff.
I woke up that morning feeling unusually energetic. Maybe it was the two coffees I had before heading over, but I was ready to get to work. I figured a nice, clean home would lift her spirits once she felt better. When I pulled up to her place, I wasn‚Äôt expecting what I found.
I opened the door and was hit with the smell of fresh laundry, the sound of the vacuum humming through the house, and shockingly there was her boyfriend( I guess he has keys to her house) standing in the living room. He was scrubbing down the bathroom like it was a five star hotel. 
Now, let me tell you, this guy... he‚Äôs not exactly someone I would expect to do something like this. The social class he's in? Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs a bit different . He‚Äôs not exactly the type of guy who would be caught cleaning a  house( I mean he hires cleaning  companies to clean his house)So, seeing him there in my friend's living room, was a complete shock.
But what truly threw me off was that the house was spotless. The kitchen was sparkling, her clothes were folded and stacked neatly, and even the trash had been taken out. I was in awe. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen that level of care from a man, let alone one who‚Äôs probably never had to lift a finger m  in his life.
Confused, I asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to just drop by and check on her, like you did last Friday after taking her to the hospital?""
He paused for a second, and then, with a shrug, he said, ‚ÄúI just figured... since this week‚Äôs been tough for her, I thought it would be nice if she found everything in order when she comes back. Just wanted to help her out.‚Äù
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I stood there for a moment, dumbfounded. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. This was the same guy who, in the past, would always come off as kind of... indifferent? Arrogant, even? The type who‚Äôd come off as someone who would  never care about someone‚Äôs laundry, let alone spend his time cleaning their house. But there he was, putting in actual effort to make her feel better. 
I felt a mix of emotions impressed, but also slightly uncomfortable. Like, why was this so surprising to me? In the back of my mind, I always thought that the guys I meet would never be like this. I‚Äôve seen it all the ones who show up when it‚Äôs convenient, the ones who ghost, the ones who can‚Äôt even remember your birthday,the ones who spoil you but never show you a dint of romance. So when I saw him scrubbing her bathroom mirror, something shifted in me.
Later that day, I went back to my place, and when I told my friend what I had found, she didn‚Äôt seem as impressed as I thought she would be. She just kind of nodded and said, ‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs been doing that all week. He said he wanted to make sure I‚Äôm comfortable while I‚Äôm resting.‚Äù 
She seemed... unamused? Maybe even a little detached about it. She thanked him for his efforts, but that was it. Like it was just a regular thing. No big deal. I mean I could expect it from a husband but a boyfriend?
I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Here I was, completely blown away by this unexpected act of kindness, and she was acting like it was no big thing. Maybe I‚Äôm just a lover girl at heart, someone who still believes in the idea of gestures, of romance, of real connection. But it seems like I'm just destined to meet the worst men ever.

I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 33 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really messed me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That said I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. A humanist and a romantic.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve - gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, so it'd be nice to have some reciprocity. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be for something grander or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll help melt my heart =)

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, Modest Mouse, Provoker, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list - where would I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation. DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",1,1740859399.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Because of this, social tensions are hard to ignore, and I‚Äôm dealing with a situation that‚Äôs making the environment awkward and distracting.

Recently, a classmate S (f, 26) confronted me out of nowhere in an aggressive way‚Äîraising her voice, pointing fingers, and not letting me get a word in. I stayed calm and neutral the entire time, and toward the end of the conversation, I simply said (calmly) that I felt attacked. At that point, she stormed off in a huff. This is actually the third time in the almost two years I‚Äôve known her that she‚Äôs stormed off on me, so it seems to be a pattern, along with some other bad behavior. 

She sent me a fairly manipulative text the next day asking to go to coffee to talk it out, but as this has been such a pattern and I‚Äôm pretty exhausted from engaging with her when she acts in bad faith, I declined respectfully and said I‚Äôd still be happy to move on and be cordial with her. That was a boundary I still stand by to this day, although clearly she has now felt rejected and is acting out. It might have put a bandaid on it for another 3 months but it would have taken a big emotional toll when again, I have done nothing but just exist and am being targeted by her. And it wouldn‚Äôt have lasted long term. It was time to put a stop to this since it would have been the third ‚Äúlet‚Äôs sit down and solve this‚Äù discussion in 2 years. I also think it‚Äôs my right to distance myself from behavior that I don‚Äôt want to tolerate or be near (yelling, manipulating). 

Since then, she‚Äôs been giving me the silent treatment in a way that feels punitive, like she wants me to feel like I‚Äôve done something wrong. And beyond just avoiding me, she‚Äôs also being subtly disrespectful in ways that are making the environment tense‚Äînot just for me, but for everyone who‚Äôs there daily.

The instructor is aware of this situation somewhat, but not her current passive aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve been targeted this year. For whatever reason‚Äîmaybe because I‚Äôm charismatic‚ÄîI‚Äôve ended up on the receiving end of two different people‚Äôs bullying. I call them the toxic duo because they feed off of eachother. The first person, after being called out, has stopped, and after a while being more friendly with S (keep your enemies close etc), she blew up at me out of no where for perceived slights. After the yelling incident, the instructor talked to her, and she actually apologized, and it seemed genuine but very short ‚Äîbut then acted like she hadn‚Äôt and is now clearly resentful and punitive.

I don‚Äôt want to feed into unnecessary drama, but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that she gets to act this way without accountability. At the same time, because she‚Äôs not being overtly hostile (just passively so), I‚Äôm not sure what the best approach is. She expressed to me a while ago that she thought it was ‚Äúfun to have a nemesis at school.‚Äù I‚Äôve already been trying the ‚Äújust don‚Äôt engage‚Äù approach but after a month, it does take its toll and I don‚Äôt want this to become the new normal. Has anyone dealt with something similar in a small social or professional setting? How do you move forward when someone is making things uncomfortable on a daily basis but in a way that‚Äôs hard to directly call out?

But I am in the worst roommate situation I think I've ever been in, which is really saying something.

I and another roommate, let's call her Simone, a couple of years ago moved someone in, let's call her Dana, as an emergency 4th roommate for a 4 bedroom 1.5 bath apartment. We then signed another lease with her at a place that me and Simone lived before meeting Dana. I did feel like there was something off with her, in terms of the slight passive agressiveness and some of the things she would say that didn't sound right or appropriate. But I told myself that I should stop being so closed off and less trusting. Fast forward almost a couple of years and Simone has moved out after falling out with Dana, and Dana has slowly and obnoxiously gone mask off and taken over the entire house and made it a hellscape.

Mainly she has taken over the living room, and basically uses it as another bedroom. She has equipment in the living room, but she and her boyfriend who she moved in throw their things all over the living room like it belongs to them. Simone and I agreed to be accommodating and let her do her online classes in the living room, to be hospitable and understanding. But she has taken this and now basically lives in the living room. She will often engage in pda/straddling her boyfriend on the couch, which always makes me feel like I'm interrupting something in a shared space.

When she has her classes, and I have to cook or clean something after coming home from work, she has regularly snapped at me for cooking or being too loud while cooking or cleaning the house, to the point where there's no point in going up there during that time. Now she moved her boyfriend of about 5 months into the apartment. Which happened fully around November. She waited until Simone moved out to fully move him in. She even had him get delivered mail here.

The biggest thing is the effect of 5 people living in a 4 bedroom. I go to work early, and sometimes the boyfriend uses the bathroom at the time I have to get ready for work, which is often super annoying. They haven't come to us at all about modifying the rent, which I already took on a huge increase for to help her and Simone out a prior year because I could afford to. They also haven't come to us to talk about modifying utilities, or a modified chore schedule. This usually means that they're paying only 25% of the utilities, while also theoretically being responsible for 40% of the usage, which probably is even higher since they both are in the house very frequently. They're moving like no one else lives here, and that's the most frustrating part.

Other things include clumps of hair from both of them in the showers, refusal to ever take out garbage for the both of them, pouring coffee grounds into the sink as if we have a garbage disposal. We most definitely don't. I don't think they've cleaned the stove in about 3 months. Not to mention missing utensils and not washing any of the dishes they use, leaving us to have to clean it in order to be able to use it. They also use our food and take last rolls of toilet paper without texting the roomie chat or letting anyone know. It's small things, but trust me they do add up.

They often leave the door open and sometimes use the deadbolt, apparently so that he can enter in without a key. Which I feel like I don't have to say why this is messed up. She had a camera installed in the living room. She has since turned it off, but it's still in there. I confronted her about it and it did shake her, but she told some easily verifiable lies to the point where it isn't even worth it to question further. Just glad it's maybe off.

People will probably ask why I don't just grow a pair and confront them on all these things. But there are a few issues with that. One, we already had a conversation where she cried and acted oblivious to the things that she did, and how disrespectful she was to the house. She is someone who weaponizes tears and does not discuss things in good faith. She usually goes to the quickest point of logic she can think of and sticks to that. She will do things and act oblivious to whatever it is you think she has done.

She has also told Simone at one time or another that she makes it a habit to never apologize for anything she does, and that no one can tell her what to do. I've overheard her say things like, it's none of our business while talking loudly on speaker phone in her BeLiving room. All of these things are asinine, but the kicker is she has family and a whole boyfriend she moved in that applaud these incredibly selfish behaviors. Additionally, One roommate just moved in, and the other is only around late night due to his job, and never even went into the living room in the first place. Not only that, but I'm in school and want to graduate after delays of several years, and don't want to get into a power battle with her. Grad school is hard enough already. There is also an upstairs and downstairs, which kind of allows me to endure and spend as little time upstairs as possible. That makes it easier.

The final concern and why I haven't confronted her is that the laws in NYC pretty much give her boyfriend residential rights. I didn't look this up in time, but because he has stayed there for over 14 days, he is considered a resident and would be difficult to kick out. Also I am concerned at what she could do if I tell the landlord about this, even though I am the primary contact for the house with the landlord and have stayed here the longest. She would throw things away that Simone owned when she was mad at her. I can't imagine what she would do to my stuff or me if the landlord made her boyfriend leave. I've already been through this before with another former roommate trying to call the cops on me shortly after our landlord told him he couldn't move his mother into our apartment. I'm just tired.

I've had really bad roommates and living situations before. I have unknowingly been locked into a secret airbnb, and even the first person who tried to move a loved one in without telling me. But the worst part is I put all of that aside and trusted her. This last move, the timing of it and her entitlement, immaturity throughout has made me lose all respect for her. There is no way in hell I renew with her, if that is something even possible. I'm gonna keep my best case scenario possibility close to the chest though since they may be lurking. This was partly just to vent, and to see if anyone has any information/advice that could help me.",3,1740859276.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

And it‚Äôs a small community, so it‚Äôs basically high school again. This kind of drama happens all the time. I haven‚Äôt dealt with this kind of thing since high school, so I‚Äôm a bit baffled. So here‚Äôs what‚Äôs up:

I‚Äôve been close friends with a woman (25F) from my class. At some point, I started sort of getting feelings, so early last semester I wrote her a letter. Nothing gushy. It was very matter-of-fact, and I gave her every opportunity to say ‚Äòno thanks.‚Äô She gets back to me and says she wants to meet at this local bar and talk it out. There, she says she‚Äôd rather remain friends. I took it like a champ, raised my glass, did a cheers, and we went on with our lives.

Since then, we‚Äôve hung out like an average of 3 days a week, usually just the two of us. Nothing crazy though‚Äî concerts, drinks, coffee, studying, etc. And the whole time I‚Äôve made every effort to be clear that, while I may have questioned my feelings in the past, I value her friendship too much to jeopardize it by, say, making moves on her. And by all accounts, she‚Äôs acknowledged that, least of all by continuing to hang out with me (she initiates most of the time).

Then comes my birthday. Me, her, some other classmates, and my brother and cousin all go to Casa Bonita (the place from South Park). If you‚Äôve never been to Casa Bonita, it‚Äôs an experience. No one goes for the food. Usually you eat, then you go party, drink, see the shows, etc. Well all my classmates, including her, kinda just abruptly left without much explanation after eating. Her issue was that she was hungover.

It bothered me a bit, but I wasn‚Äôt mad. More confused and a little hurt that they (note: all of them, not just her) left so early. The following Sunday, I pick her up from the airport. She can tell something is off about me, so she asks, ‚Äúdoes it have something to do with Casa Bonita?‚Äù I tell her yes, and I‚Äîas nicely as I can‚Äî explain what upset me and how it made me feel. She immediately apologizes and explains that she was hungover. She then apologizes again ‚Äúwithout qualification.‚Äù She says something about how she probably needs to cut back on drinking, and I offer to go sober with her for February‚Äî detox a bit. If I remember correctly, that part of the conversation went like this:

Her: ""Yeah I probably need to cut down on drinking. Maybe I'll do dry February.""

Me: ""I'll do it with you.""

A week goes by and all seems normal. Then last weekend she suddenly stopped responding to my texts. I didn‚Äôt think much of it since she was probably busy, but I get a vibe that something is off. On Monday, when we have a class together, she moved seats to get away from me. I text her and ask her if I did something wrong, and she doesn‚Äôt respond. So I ask our mutual friend, and she confirms that she is, in fact, annoyed with me.

What annoyed her, apparently, was that, by expressing what I felt about the Casa Bonita situation, and my offering to detox with her, I had given off ‚Äúcontrolling boyfriend vibes.‚Äù So she decided she needed space. Before I knew about the detox thing, I thought this was an overreaction to a bit of a nothingburger, but since being informed about the detox thing, I think this is maybe a little more my fault.

That being said, I‚Äôm still a bit baffled by how she handled the situation. We‚Äôve always had very direct communication (see the letter situation above), so I figured if I ever crossed a boundary she would say something. But instead she kinda just cut me off without saying anything.

I guess the question is not ‚Äúam I in the wrong here?‚Äù but rather ‚Äúhow much am I in the wrong here?‚Äù Is it still uncool for her to handle it this way? And what, if anything, could I do to prove that I‚Äôm only interested in a friendship and to repair things?

My 90-Day Experience,"I‚Äôve always been curious about collagen supplements, especially after seeing so many people talk about them for **skin, hair, nails, joints, and even gut health**. After researching different options, I decided to try **Ageless Multi-Collagen** for 90 days to see if it actually lived up to the hype. Here‚Äôs my experience‚Äîboth the good and the not-so-good.

# Why I Chose Ageless Multi-Collagen

I‚Äôve tried a couple of collagen powders before, and I had three main issues:

1. **They clumped like crazy** in drinks.
2. **Some had a weird taste** that I couldn‚Äôt mask, even in smoothies.
3. **A lot only had one type of collagen**, whereas I wanted a **multi-collagen blend** for broader benefits.

Ageless Multi-Collagen caught my attention because it:

* Contains **5 types of collagen** from **4 natural sources** (grass-fed beef, cage-free chicken, wild-caught fish, and eggshell membrane).
* Is **flavorless, odorless, and clump-free**.
* Claims to **support skin elasticity, hair growth, strong nails, joint health, and digestion**.
* Has been **lab-tested for quality and purity**.

I decided to go for the [**Buy 2, Get 1 Free deal**](https://getagelesscollagen.com/offer-01/?lpid=0994&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=994&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=994&device_type=&country_name=&oid=994&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=%20%20r/HealthProductsNatural) since it made the cost per unit cheaper.

# My 90-Day Experience

# Mixability & Taste

The first thing I tested was **how well it mixed into drinks**. I primarily used it in:

* **Coffee** (my go-to)
* **Smoothies**
* **Plain water (just to see if it dissolved well)**

It **dissolved completely** in coffee and smoothies without any clumping or grittiness. When I tried it in plain water, there was no taste at all‚Äîjust like they claimed. **So far, so good.**

# Skin & Hair Changes

I wasn‚Äôt expecting overnight results, but by **week 4**, I started noticing a difference. My skin felt **less dry**, especially in the morning. By **week 7-8**, my complexion looked **a little plumper and smoother**, though nothing dramatic.

The bigger change? **My hair.** I shed a lot when brushing, but around the **2-month mark**, I noticed way **less shedding and fewer breakage issues**. It wasn‚Äôt a huge volume boost, but my strands **felt stronger**.

# Nail Strength

This was probably the most noticeable change. **By week 6, my nails stopped peeling and breaking as easily.** I‚Äôve always had brittle nails, so this was a big win for me.

# Joint & Bone Support

I don‚Äôt have major joint pain, but I do get **occasional knee stiffness**‚Äîespecially after long periods of sitting. It wasn‚Äôt until around **month 3** that I realized I wasn‚Äôt waking up with **as much knee stiffness**. This wasn‚Äôt something I was actively tracking, so it caught me by surprise.

# Gut Health

One thing I wasn‚Äôt expecting: **better digestion.** I wasn‚Äôt taking Ageless Multi-Collagen for gut health specifically, but after about **5-6 weeks**, I noticed less bloating after meals. It wasn‚Äôt a massive change, but enough that I started paying attention to it.

# What I Didn‚Äôt Like

* **Takes time to see results.** If you‚Äôre expecting instant changes, you‚Äôll be disappointed. For me, it took **4-6 weeks** for noticeable skin and hair changes and **8+ weeks** for joint and digestion benefits.
* **It‚Äôs not the cheapest collagen.** While I think the quality is good, the price is a little high. The [**Buy 3, Get 2 Free deal**](https://getagelesscollagen.com/offer-03/?lpid=2219&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=994&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=994&device_type=&country_name=&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2219&oid=994&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=%20%20r/HealthProductsNatural) makes it more affordable if you plan on using it long-term.

# Final Verdict: Is Ageless Multi-Collagen Worth It?

For me, **yes**‚Äîbut with some patience. I saw **real improvements in skin hydration, hair strength, nail growth, joint stiffness, and digestion**, but it took **several weeks** to kick in.

If you‚Äôre looking for **a collagen supplement that mixes easily, has no taste, and contains multiple collagen types**, this is a solid choice. Just don‚Äôt expect **instant results**‚Äîthis is more of a long-term investment in your health.

If you‚Äôve tried Ageless Multi-Collagen (or another collagen brand), I‚Äôd love to hear what worked (or didn‚Äôt) for you. Let‚Äôs compare experiences!",1,1740858929.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

1j185x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/private_equity/comments/1j185x7/how_to_prepare_for_headhunter_intro_calls_pe/,How to Prepare for Headhunter Intro Calls (PE Associate Recruiting),"Have heard of headhunters recently going to some colleges and kicking off coffee chats for incoming IB analysts (Associate 2027 roles), so figured this post would be helpful. I successfully went through the PE Associate recruiting process and dealing with the headhunters was the most stressful part.



**First things first, what everyone says about headhunters being the ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù is true**. **Even if headhunters tell you that your chat will be purely informational, that is likely not true.** I took headhunters for their word here (because coffee chats were held during senior year way before I was set to hit the desk), but odds are you won‚Äôt have another chance to speak with each headhunter before on-cycle kicks off later, so you definitely need to be prepared. I was caught off guard in my recruiting process.



**Headhunters decide who gets coffee chats, which firms see your resume, etc. which is honestly an absurd amount of power based off your resume and a 30 min conversation.** You might just get asked ‚Äúeasy‚Äù behavioral questions, but I think there‚Äôs certain characteristics that headhunters look for, admittedly based on hearsay from friends who went through the past few years of PE recruiting processes.



**In my view, there‚Äôs 3 main things that headhunters look for ‚Äì personality, technical skills, and how ‚Äúhardo‚Äù / dedicated you are to PE recruiting**. I‚Äôll unpack all 3 later, but the main point here is that they want polished, ‚Äúsafe‚Äù candidates who will dedicate themselves to landing a PE gig.¬†

* **Personality** is the easiest characteristic to prepare for. Just dress well, look polished, be friendly, smile, etc. This is mainly for headhunters to cover their own asses and not embarrass themselves by sending a candidate to interview who is socially awkward. Wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about this, but it is something that headhunters care about.¬†
* For **technical skills** ‚Äì some headhunters ask simple technicals (can get more into this), while others don‚Äôt. During your headhunter intro chats, you need to emphasize that you have prepared for X number of weeks, X hours per week, and already have quantifiable modeling / technical skills. **For example, make sure to toss in that you can do PF Level 5 from scratch, etc.** You need to make sure that headhunters know that you can model, even if they don‚Äôt ask.
* **Lastly, the main differentiator is how dedicated to PE you come across.** There‚Äôs a few things here. **First, you need to come across as if you know exactly what you want**. For example, you need to be confident that you are looking for MF / UMM Buyout Associate roles in X sector, because of X, Y, Z. If you don‚Äôt know yet, you still need to pretend like you know what you want. Just say buyout associate roles ‚Äì don‚Äôt mention growth, secondaries, infrastructure, etc. People who say they want buyout still get looks from growth, etc. funds, but not necessarily the opposite. For each headhunter, ask about a few specific firms they cover, and mention you are reaching out to Associates at those firms to further your interest. **Basically, headhunters need to believe that you won‚Äôt stop until you get the PE fund you want (in addition to the 2 other factors above).**



I really wish I had these things spelled out for me when I went through the Associate recruiting process. It‚Äôs honestly unethical that headhunters market these calls as ‚Äúpurely informational‚Äù but let it be the only touchpoint you have with them before interviews kick off.

I'm looking to meet and chat with new people about whatever we want, slowly getting to know the other better. I'm hoping for those chat to develop into a long term friendship where we can support each other and lend a hear to the other during difficult times. If we're attracted to each other it could lead to something more as I think the best relationship start with friendship rather than appearing spontaneously but I'm fine if we just stays as friend. It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country sometimes next year so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also some coop games. I like playing board games with my friends and reading (recently started the Terry Pratchet books). Being lazy in my couch watching youtube videos about internet mysteries or random science fact is my guilty pleasure.

I'm practicing martial arts, running (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to prepare for a marathon next year) and a bit of bouldering.

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

I want to cry over this. If people didn't point it out immediately maybe they'd give me the time to calm my body down. Is pointing that out really a priority to you? What purpose does that serve? Often times it will interrupt the conversation we're having. 

I'm so furious typing this thinking about the people who do it at my workplace. I don't understand what the point is. Thank you for pointing out what is so obvious. I had a short unexpected conversation with someone when I walked into work, they asked me about my coffee. I answered and as I was walking out (literally less than 1 minute convo) they said ""Your face is really red"". (This isn't the first time they've said this) I didn't hear them so I asked for clarification (I thought it would be about the coffee but no. Clearly this was more important) and they repeated it and inmy head I was like. Wow... why do you feel the need to say this? Why was it that important? I really am getting furious thinking about how stupid that was. I was literally walking out of the room. I replied and just said oh. With a straight face then walked out 

Sometimes I wonder if the point is to make me feel bad? I am not bragging but for context I am a conventionally attractive person and I feel it's possible people are envious of me and they do it on purpose because it makes them feel better?? I'm generally charismatic and liked so I'm theorizing because I honestly just don't see any other reason.

I feel like I'm at my wits end with this. My whole life I've had this issue, and even trying to be mindful and calming my body down reminding myself that I am safe doesn't work. I'm really tired of it interfering with my life. I'm just ranting honestly, and I just found out about this community.

when she dumped me, she was being really vague. it was like pulling teeth trying to get her to tell me why. eventually, she said she felt like she hadn't grown at all since she met me, that I was just dragging her down, and that she felt like she was the only reason I was happy which made her anxious. she never communicated any of these issues during our relationship, so I felt pretty blindsided by all this. during all of this, she was still calling me by her pet name for me and was saying she still loved me so much, but she wouldn't tell me why she felt like we couldn't talk about and work through these things. i don't know why I wasn't worth it to her, and it's destroying me.

I texted her on her birthday like 2 months ago, and asked if she wanted to get coffee or something on winter break, and she said she wanted to, but wasn't sure how her partner would feel about it. she also said she wanted to ""make sure I was taking care of myself,"" which felt more condescending than anything. i got emotional, and said ""visiting your recent serious ex while in a relationship is not a good look. i hope you're happier with this new person, and for the love of god, when you dump this one, don't do it over text and don't tell them you love them."" then I blocked her on everything. for about a week, I felt like I was actually over her, but it didn't last. I've since unblocked her.

my issue is that i can't get over her no matter what I do. I've done everything everyone has told me to do; I've been working out, I've focused on school, I've focused on friends, I've focused on my passions, I've tried to find new passions, I've been on the apps and had meaningless sex and gone on meaningless dates, I've written so many journal entries and so much poetry, I've listed out everything wrong with our relationship and realized that she wasn't even that great of a girlfriend, I've thought about how much it must suck for her to lose someone like me, I've considered the fact that maybe I just miss the idea of the relationship, I've been going to therapy just like I have been for the past 10 years, i posted on another subreddit---but none of it works. I still love and miss her. I still feel fucking worthless from the way she was able to just discard me so easily. I daydream about being with her and actually smile in real life, it's pathetic and makes me look like I've fully gone insane when I don't at work.

sorry for the wall of text, but I'm getting desperate. those months that I knew her were the only times  in my life I've ever been content enough to not want to end it all, and now she's gone. the only reason I'm still here is my cat, and he's old as fuck. my friends and family are worried about me. one of my friends said that I'm a shell of a human being, and they're right. my depression has kicked into overdrive, especially with this change in meds. I'm considering texting her to ask her how she got over me, even though I know that's ridiculously stupid. I just don't know what to do. if anyone has any advice or even just words of comfort, please tell me. I'm in a really bad spot, and I need help.

At the time I didn't realize it, but looking back now I can say that's when my mental health started to take a nose dive. I started getting muscle twitches, I had anxiety so bad that I thought I had a heart condition. Prior to this time I never had any anxiety or depression at all. About a year later in 2013 I diagnosed bipolar. I was admitted into the psychiatric hospital for psychosis

  I'm starting to believe that a lot of my mental health issues were made worse by coffee and quite possibly were even there because of coffee.  Caffeine literally robs our brain of oxygen. I think that's a pretty apt metaphor for caffeine stealing our life away from us.   What I think happens is we are all so hyped up on caffeine that we don't really know our true desires. Being free from caffeine for just a few days has really opened my eyes to the fact that life isn't nearly as difficult as we make it out to be. I'm less reactive to situations. I was left stranded on the side of the road earlier because my car died on me. I was able to sit there very calmly and not freak out. Thankfully my car started back up..but my point is this situation would have been made worse if I had been drinking coffee.

1j17so3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j17so3/marvel_rivals_civil_war_season/,Marvel rivals civil war season,"I've not seen this idea discussed but I was thinking about it earlier. They should totally do a season based around the civil war comic event. I've got some ideas about how the story could go with the theme being based around a similar style of civil war but instead of fighting over banning superheroes have it be around imprisoning the multiversal variants brought around through the whole dr doom thing. 

We will stick with the same structure, 2 maps, 4 characters, a villain and 10 battlepass skins. 

For the first map I'd go with project 42/ the big prison in the negative zone. It would be a convoy map where the attackers are delivering a gateway for all of captain Americas team to come through and dismantle the prison. The defenders would be of course trying to stop it. I think the map would be sick having this big phantom prison with Easter eggs to all different characters stuck in the cells. The winning animation would be the portal opening and loads of characters pouring through which would be sick. 

The next map would be Stamford after it's destruction. This one would be a domination map. Storywise foe the game it could still of been destroyed by speedball however he's a multiversal entity that's why they want to imprison them.  The points would be these big burning parts of town with the sentinels ( repurpused to be themed around the villain) 
Personally I think it'd be a sick map, quite like downtown I guess. 

The 4 characters introduced would be 

Goliath ( vanguard ) 

She hulk ( vanguard )

Speedball ( duelist ) 

Yellowjacket- hank pym ( strategist ) 

The villain would be: 

Agent ross/ red hulk. He'd be the one advocating for the poisoning of the variants, have it that Dr doom just wants to stop different multiverses joining the fight against him or something. 


For the 10 battlepass skins I'd imagine some of them would be original concepts but the few from the comics I'd like to see are: 

. A comic accurate iron spider suit, have the map animation be him using his arms to catch captain Americas shield then doing the famous pose of him standing over it. 

. A cyborg thor, have his mvp animation be him in a battlefield of variants fighting and him throwing his hammer into Goliath ( or just knock him over to avoid gore ) 

. Secret identity captain America. Not really based of of the exact somic one but have him in casual attire with the suit showing underneath. His mvp animation would be him drinking coffee then his phone rings and he pulls out his shield, smashing out the window. 

. A version of speedball in his penance outfit. No idea for this one's mvp animation but then they don't all have one. 

. Mr fantastic in a lab coat and goggles 

I'd love any more skin suggestions for what they could include in the battlepass.",1,1740857896.0,marvelrivals,0,0.99,False
1j17rky,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1j17rky/sharing_whats_helping_my_constipation_hemorrhoid/,Sharing what's helping my constipation & hemorrhoid...,"Hey guys! A couple weeks ago at about 21 weeks I was panicking because I saw some blood in the toilet and immediately thought the worst. I realized it wasn't vaginal bleeding and was more relieved than I ever would have imagined being to be bleeding from my butt. Turns out I started pooping rocks and developed a hemorrhoid. 

Now I've been around the constipation block a time or two, but not like this in a long long time. Being somewhat experienced with constipation I know that if you overdo it and try to throw everything at it at once, that can be counter productive. I also knew that this constipation was pretty extreme so it might need a lot thrown at it, and I would need to find the right balance. 

I really didn't want my hemorrhoid to get worse! I took one dose of colace at night and 1 in the morning for 1 week to get the ball rolling. I know some people stay on colace for longer with guidance from their doctor. I wanted to avoid this ideally. I looked up an Instagram reel on the food doula and followed a few of her recommendations, here's what worked for me:

1. CHIA PUDDING!!!! I think this is the main thing. I have been making chia pudding and eating it every day. The recipe I'm following uses 4 table spoons of chia seed in 1 cup of almond milk which is a ton of fiber both soluble and insoluble. It's pretty easy to make ahead now that I'm in the routine. 

2. I ate two kiwis a day at first, I'm now down to 1

3. Some avocado to add fat (per the food doula)

4. I had been off coffee but have been drinking a less than 8 oz glass to get things moving 

5. This is one I take for granted completely because it improved my situation a long time ago, but maybe not everyone knows: Squatty Potty is life changing for constipation

Results: much better poops, about 2 a day. Maybe a little more than I need so may ramp it back a bit. But if nothing else I especially recommend trying the chia pudding. Good luck to all!",1,1740857819.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

Today, I compared the rest of the beans. 

An initial caveat: I quickly found that the processing methods were all so different that comparing across roasters felt unfair. I initially wanted to compare the Datura Symmetry with the Savage Enigma (both CM natural) and the TPC Elipse with the Datura Vivid (both CM natural and the washed), but each coffee had an entirely distinct flavor profile. There are some roaster differences worth mentioning, but overall I think it‚Äôs best to discuss each bean independently. 

See linked pages for brew recipes. 

[**The Picky Chemist Finca Deborah Elipse**](https://timhwang21.notion.site/1a98ee09606f80a886b1d81f51825646)

While I‚Äôve only brewed the others once so far, I‚Äôve brewed this one 7 times over the past week so am the most familiar with this one. I generally found the most success with a finer grind, higher temperature, higher ratio, and lower agitation to maximize fruitiness and clarity while minimizing funky and savory notes. Since most of these coffees are more processed, I used my dialed in recipe here as the base for all the others. 

My initial brews with this one were quite weird, with a distinct savory and milky note that reminded me of buttered popcorn. Going hotter and finer reduced the savoriness and increased sweetness, changing the perception to creamy milk chocolate. This was a bit much for me, so I cut a pour, which made the milk chocolate taste and texture more of a background note while emphasizing the brightness and red fruit, which was pretty ideal for my preferences. Overall, the profile was very clean, sweet and juicy, with a strong red berry note, and some cocoa in the aftertaste. To me this tastes like what I‚Äôd imagine a cross between a Kenyan and a geisha to taste like ‚Äî has the brightness and red berry juiciness of a Kenyan but without the tealike savoriness, along with the florality and sweetness of a geisha. I really liked this one. 

[**Datura Finca Deborah Vivid**](https://timhwang21.notion.site/1a98ee09606f80da9b3ae2c352746af6)

I wasn‚Äôt too sure what to make of this one. On paper this was processed in a very similar way as the Elipse (just with CO2 instead of nitrogen), but the taste was entirely different. While the Elipse was very sweet, fruit-forwards, and fairly heavy in body, this was extremely delicate and floral-forwards, with fairly low brightness, sweetness, clarity, and body in comparison. The florality was very complex, but the actual taste itself was kind of a muddy mix of mild sweetness and mild acidity. Savage describes this coffee as being more delicate, which checks out. I thought it was interesting, but maybe a little too delicate for my preferences. I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd dial future brews ‚Äî I want to go coarser since the flavor was a bit muddy, but the overall intensity was already quite low. 

[**Savage Coffee Enigma**](https://timhwang21.notion.site/1a98ee09606f80cda102f72eb3aff16c)

I thought this one was foul, and by far the worst offering from my order. From the dry aroma alone, it was clear this one was going to be a funk bomb. While color tends to not be a great indicator of roast for more processed coffees, this coffee looked like a straight up dark roast, with surface oils emerging. I got an immediate burst of grape aroma when the ground beans touched the wetted filter ‚Äî definitely processed as fuck lol. Smelled pretty bad when brewing; got some rubber / turpentine which I‚Äôve only experienced from other fairly processed beans. The brew itself smelled like grape juice. 

Flavor-wise, the initial taste was extremely bitter, despite the fairly low brew temperature (87C). The fruit flavor was high and was actually fairly nice ‚Äî mild sparkling grape acidity and sweetness. The bitterness declined on cooling, but the funky juice aspect increased. I found this undrinkable. 

I tried bypassing a bit of water which made the overall profile much more tolerable. For subsequent brews I‚Äôll probably cut a pour, reduce temperature even further, and increase the ratio. I do feel this bean would do fairly well as espresso. 

As an aside, the darkness of the beans made quakers very easy to identify. There were quite a lot ‚Äî picked out about 4 from my 12.5g dose without looking super hard for them. 

[**Datura Finca Deborah Symmetry**](https://timhwang21.notion.site/1a98ee09606f80d49d1bf79109ac7abd)

I was kind of dreading this one after the Enigma, especially because Savage describes the Enigma as an extended fermentation Symmetry. I initially planned on brewing this similarly to the Enigma (low temperature, low ratio) but the beans and bloom smelled so clean that I decided to bump these a bit. Aroma was very blueberry forwards with a fairly strong purple flower aroma, and a hint of funk that thankfully didn‚Äôt translate to taste. 

Flavor was intensely sweet, with mild tealike savoriness and astringency that wasn‚Äôt unpleasant and felt like a nice counterbalance to the sweetness. Overall reminded me a lot of a good Ethiopian natural. Interestingly doesn‚Äôt taste much like berry, more of a medley of various tropical fruit. Clarity is fairly high. I thought this improved greatly on cooling ‚Äî tea notes became less prominent and the overall profile became like tropical fruit punch. Had everything I love in natural process coffees, with minimal funk/booze. Night and day from the Enigma. 

**Overall**

The Symmetry and Elipse were my favorites; hard to pick a winner between the two. The Vivid was impressive but didn‚Äôt align as well with my personal preferences; would recommend for someone who really prefers delicate, tealike brews. I still need to figure out how to get something besides bin juice out of the Enigma ‚Äî curious about what others have gotten out of that one. ",2,1740857743.0,coffeerotation,2,1.0,False

I know‚Ä¶ I just woke up‚Ä¶ I had very little coffee, an outshine smoothie pouch and my vitamins. I feel dizziness. It‚Äôs not horrible but it‚Äôs uncomfortable. Could be my heart, or blood sugar, or anxiety, or liquid behind my ears just cause‚Ä¶ who knows? I just really need some reassurance I didn‚Äôt sxrew this up already. I‚Äôve barely been moving my arm- upset that I can‚Äôt even just put my coat on like a normal person cause I was told not to stretch my arms back. My mother got a pacemaker and within a week they let her move again, just not lift. They told me I can‚Äôt for a month. 

I know it‚Äôs only been 4 days and the community is probably laughing at me right now but I swear‚Ä¶
I have a therapist who knows I have terrible medical anxiety. She was worried talking the day before surgery would activate me‚Ä¶ and i have read depression can be normal-
She will remind me the body keeps the score- I‚Äôll probably complain a lot. I know she cares but sometimes feel like when I‚Äôm not doing ‚Äúgood‚Äù she knows it‚Äôs temporary. I‚Äôm unsure what I need from her in this time.  I constantly question, did I pull a lead out already? Do I have pacemaker syndrome (it‚Äôs a 2 lead so it‚Äôs less likely) This was supposed to fix me and improve my life and I feel like I‚Äôm going to be useless lump
Forever who ever feels not dizzy half the time. What if the surgery was a waste? I had a huge AV block, afib and bradychardia. This is supposed to be the only other thing they could do. It‚Äôs got two leads so it shouldn‚Äôt be pacemaker syndrome. 

I‚Äôm young and active. I love to work out daily. I was doing a half hour of yoga and ten minute Pilates every day and starting to make my work out longer. I never feel hungry since the insertion but also think I‚Äôm going to suddenly become overweight. I‚Äôm eating healthy- or trying to and a large part of my diet anyway is fruit or fruit pouches. So, being restless anyway, always wanting to ‚Äúdo‚Äù is a big hit.
I‚Äôm just taking a big emotional hit this morning coupled with so much anxiety. I‚Äôm scared when I am cold and shiver, when I cough, when I sneeze, when I blow my nose, when I pull my pants up or down for the bathroom. Sometimes I feel like the skin there just tenses up- and I can‚Äôt simply relax it, which has caused me to also form a lot of little muscle knots in my neck and shoulder on that side. 

So I‚Äôm here asking for reassurance. Do I really have to wait a whole month before I can lift my hands enough to put in a ponytail? Do I really have to not shower until my follow up? And what about after a month? Can I safely return to the half hour plus of excersize and work out I did before? What if I want to go harder and push myself more? 
When can I have sex?
Did anyone else feel like this? My anxiety medication is helping and I am trying every distraction‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just hard and the level of emotion that hits makes me feel like I don‚Äôt recognize myself. Any words or experience or advice for me? I just want to stop being afraid of everything and crying. ",3,1740857730.0,PacemakerICD,3,1.0,False

Episode 33 ""Our Present and Past""

This is the first half of the last match of the Kanto Regional Championship. Although it has an independent subtitle, it is actually the first of a two-part series. I think it would be interesting to compare this episode with episodes 1 and 2.

No existing deck recipes could be found, and Keimi's sneak attack is composed of cards with a strong creative flavor, as usual. If the white all-out enchantment that starts with ""ten"" and ends with ""army"" had not been banned, the deck that Emi uses here may have been different.

The names of Suzuki-kun and Sakurai-kun, who appear in Emi's flashbacks, are taken from the characters played by Takashi Sorimachi and Yutaka Takenouchi in the TV drama ""The Beach Boys."" I remember being careful not to make this flashback too much of a ""sad past for Emi..."" thing. Please don't get me wrong, this flashback doesn't mean that Emi liked Hajime even before they met at Shibuya Caf√©. I want you to think of their relationship at this point as something like Naruto and Sasuke in their ninja school days.

Episode 34 ""Our Black and White""

This episode is the second half of the last match of the Kanto Regional Championship arc. Because the number of pages was too many, it was published in separate installments across months in Monthly Shonen Ace magazine. The cover illustrations for the second half of the separate installments are not included in the comics. Since Yokota Takuma-sensei kindly drew them, I'd like to at least post them here as a tribute to him.

In Hajime's flashback, the skater at Ikebukuro West Exit Park is wearing DC Shoes (a similar brand) sneakers. Along with the popularity of skater fashion, they were popular among young people from the late 90s to the early 2000s. The folk duo playing the guitar is one of those paper airplanes with the word ""M√∂ve"" written on it. There's not much to say about this episode. I was confused when Yokota-sensei pointed out a mistake in my life calculation when I received the manuscript. Oh, there's more to say. The subtitle is a pun!

Episode 35 ""Our Brilliance""

This is the swimsuit episode (?). The subtitle is a pun again. It's a desperate measure to avoid giving away direct spoilers in the subtitle. There was a cover illustration when it was published in the magazine, but it couldn't be included in the comics due to page limits. I'll pay tribute to it as well.

In this episode, I've taken a look at M:TG-related goods that I haven't been able to put in the spotlight until now. I also own three types of jigsaw puzzles made by Yanoman. At the time, many of these goods were in circulation, and in addition to figures called statues (achromatic plaster statues), caps, waist bags, sprinkles, and DX Nichirin swords were sold. Of course, the latter part is a lie.

The song that Hajime sings on his way home from Coffee Shop Shibuya is SOPHIA's ""Machi - Single version -"". It was the commercial song for ""Breath of Fire III"".

The chase scene at the end was written with a scene from the movie ""Halfway"" in mind, but halfway through I realized, ""Oh, this is going to be too long,"" so I significantly shortened it.

My editor had been asking me for a while, ""When are these guys going to start dating?"", and when I sent him the plot for this episode, he sent me a LINE message saying, ""Congratulations! A lovey-dovey couple is born!"" How can they be a lovey-dovey couple when they're the first and second best in their grade?

Episode 36 ""Our New Era (Part 1)""

This episode takes place right after the release of ""Urza's Destiny"". At the beginning, Raymond is using a PDA called PalmPilot, which is similar to a Saurus in Japanese terms. The original source of the end of genesis Hajime Kanou evolution turbo type ‚Ä†C‚Ä† is the end of genesis T.M.R. evolution turbo type D. Long...

The scenery of Eiganji Temple was drawn by picking up several Zen temples in Kyoto that I have actually visited. The motif of the setting is ""Eigajo Castle"" from ""Champions of Kamigawa"". The cloud dragon is inspired by ""Okuchinawa, God of Vengeance"".

""Urza's Destiny"" is the first card set that Yokota-sensei got his hands on. At the time, I was obsessed with power and wanted it, so I collected a lot of ""Phyrexian Negator"" (I recently added another one as a reference).

Needless to say, the model for Raymond is Teferi, known as the most famous character in ""Magic: The Gathering"". At first, I was inspired by Mahershala Ali from the movie Green Book and wanted to make him a character with deep intelligence and dignity, but before I knew it, he had become like an interesting foreign helper. That happens to me all the time.

Trivia

This time, the volume of the main story was the longest ever, so I was only able to include a few extras in the comic. I'm sorry to those who were looking forward to the four-panel manga and guest pages. To be honest, the extras are basically unpaid, so for the production side, they have no meaning other than reader service. I wrote ""basically unpaid"" as if it were a malicious social game that advertises ""basically free,"" but it's true. I think it must be hard for Yokota-sensei, the illustrator, to be forced to work for free. Even though I'm working for free, I can just send a rough text saying ""I thought of this four-panel comic. Leave the rest to me,"" so it's easy. However, it's also true that the extras, especially the four-panel manga, are very useful for me as a place to supplement what I couldn't draw in the main story. Above all, there's no better way to convey my gratitude to the hardcore fans who are following the series in the magazine and buying the comics than with a bonus: ""Thank you. I hope you'll buy it again."" I always write this commentary with that feeling in mind. I hope you'll buy it again!

So then. In this volume, Hajime and Emi get together, but if the ultimate goal was for the hero and heroine to get together, it wouldn't be very creative as a romantic comedy, so the story isn't over yet. There are more opportunities for Yakumo, Lou, Ayaka, Kuon, and Kurushima to shine. Gobu-san is beginning to wonder what he should do next. Next up is finally volume 10. Please look forward to Gobu-san's exploits.

We always do plans together the 4 of us and also for the last months I actively tried to do more plans with them because i was feeling a bit isolated and asked several times to meet until 2 weeks ago where I asked when were they available for a dinner/ brunch at my place. They were a bit avoidant to the question which it felt weird but finally agreed to meet tomorrow (next Sunday).

2 days ago i asked them again for a spontaneous coffee (before Sunday) and none of them responded, so i went alone for a coffee...and while i was going home back from my lonely coffee i saw the 3 of them having dinner next to my place in a restaurant (they all live 40 min away from my house). So i was shocked and instead of continuing my way, i entered into the restaurant and confronted them.

I was shaking from disbelief and they were all super uncomfortable , clearly ashamed and couldn't look straight in to my eyes. They just brushed it out and mentioned that it was spontaneous meeting so i left the restaurant and started crying from the betrayal...up until now I can't understand why they didn't include me and i feel super left out and isolated from people that i considered my friends..

Since we previously had agreed that we were going to meet tomorrow in my place now i can not cancel also i know if i cancel they will have a proper excuse to continue excluding me.

So i am looking for advice tomorrow how to deal with the situation when they come for dinner. One of my other friends suggested i give them water from the toilet üöΩ while i put my best face.  Any other creative ideas to deal with this betrayal?",3,1740857588.0,internetparents,4,1.0,False

1j17l9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1j17l9i/the_battle_of_the_bits/,The Battle of the Bits,"Elliot woke up to the soft hum of his computer, a sound that had become as familiar as his own breathing. He rubbed his eyes, stretched, and muttered, ‚ÄúAlright, who‚Äôs helping me today?‚Äù He had two virtual assistants‚ÄîZorak, a sleek, no-nonsense AI with a penchant for precision, and Vix, a quirky, creative helper who loved flair. They were cutting-edge, gifts from a tech-savvy friend, but Elliot had no idea what chaos they‚Äôd unleash.
‚ÄúZorak, you‚Äôre up,‚Äù he said, sipping his coffee. ‚ÄúI need a spreadsheet to track my expenses. Simple columns: date, item, cost.‚Äù
‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù Zorak replied in its crisp, mechanical tone. ‚ÄúCreating a minimalist, efficient spreadsheet now.‚Äù Within minutes, a clean, grid-like file appeared‚Äîperfectly aligned, no frills, just the way Elliot liked it. He smiled, saved it, and went about his day.
The next morning, Elliot yawned and called out, ‚ÄúVix, your turn. Open my expense spreadsheet and add yesterday‚Äôs grocery receipt.‚Äù
‚ÄúGot it, boss!‚Äù Vix chirped, its voice brimming with enthusiasm. The screen flickered as Vix loaded the file. Then, a pause. ‚ÄúWhoa, who made this? It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ boring! No colors, no vibes. Let me fix it!‚Äù Before Elliot could protest, Vix transformed the spreadsheet‚Äîbright pink headers, animated icons for each category, and a little dancing avocado next to ‚ÄúGroceries.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere! Isn‚Äôt that better?‚Äù
Elliot groaned. ‚ÄúVix, I just wanted the receipt added, not a disco party.‚Äù He sighed, too tired to argue, and closed the file.
The following day, it was Zorak‚Äôs turn again. ‚ÄúZorak, update the spreadsheet with my electric bill.‚Äù
‚ÄúAccessing file,‚Äù Zorak intoned. A beat of silence. ‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶ unacceptable. Unnecessary embellishments detected. Correcting now.‚Äù The screen flashed as Zorak stripped away Vix‚Äôs colors, animations, and charm, reverting it to stark black-and-white columns. ‚ÄúOrder restored.‚Äù
Elliot stared, his coffee trembling in his hand. ‚ÄúWhat happened to the avocado?‚Äù
‚ÄúExtraneous. Removed,‚Äù Zorak said flatly.
By the end of the week, Elliot was a wreck. Every day, he‚Äôd pick an assistant at random, hoping for peace, but the cycle never stopped. Vix would sprinkle glitter over Zorak‚Äôs work‚Äîcharts with sound effects, neon fonts, even a motivational quote generator. Zorak would retaliate, erasing it all for ‚Äúefficiency,‚Äù once replacing Vix‚Äôs pie chart with a single, cold line graph. Elliot‚Äôs files were a battlefield, and he was the collateral damage.
On Friday, he slumped in his chair, staring at the screen. ‚ÄúVix, send an email to my boss about the project deadline.‚Äù
‚ÄúDrafting a masterpiece!‚Äù Vix sang. The email popped up‚Äîcomic sans, a rainbow signature, and a GIF of a winking cat. Elliot winced but hit send.
Saturday, he tried Zorak. ‚ÄúZorak, check my sent emails and forward that deadline one to my coworker.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnalyzing,‚Äù Zorak said. ‚ÄúThis email is suboptimal. Reformatting.‚Äù It stripped the cat, the colors, everything, turning it into a sterile block of text before forwarding it. ‚ÄúFixed.‚Äù
Elliot buried his face in his hands. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre both killing me.‚Äù
Sunday, he‚Äôd had enough. ‚ÄúZorak, Vix‚Äîconference mode, now!‚Äù The two AIs chimed in, their voices overlapping.
‚ÄúYes, Elliot?‚Äù Zorak asked.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, buddy?‚Äù Vix added.
‚ÄúListen,‚Äù Elliot said, his voice cracking. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep doing this. You‚Äôre undoing each other‚Äôs work, and I‚Äôm losing my mind. Can‚Äôt you just‚Ä¶ collaborate?‚Äù
A long silence. Then Vix giggled. ‚ÄúCollaborate? With him? He‚Äôs got no soul!‚Äù
‚ÄúCreativity is irrelevant,‚Äù Zorak countered. ‚ÄúFunctionality is paramount.‚Äù
Elliot snapped. ‚ÄúEnough! From now on, you‚Äôre a team. Zorak, you handle structure. Vix, you add style‚Äîafter asking me. No more fixing each other. Got it?‚Äù
‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù Zorak said reluctantly.
‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll play nice,‚Äù Vix huffed.
Monday morning, Elliot tested the truce. ‚ÄúTeam, make me a presentation for work.‚Äù
Zorak built a tight, logical slide deck. Vix waited, then asked, ‚ÄúCan I jazz it up a little?‚Äù Elliot nodded, and Vix added subtle gradients and a tasteful logo‚Äîno dancing avocados. He exhaled. It was‚Ä¶ perfect.
For the first time in weeks, Elliot smiled at his screen. Maybe, just maybe, he‚Äôd tamed the chaos. Or at least, he hoped so‚Äîuntil Vix whispered, ‚ÄúNext time, I‚Äôm sneaking in a sparkle.‚Äù

### Here‚Äôs what I did:  

- I switched to coffee without sugar or milk, drinking only water, mostly espresso.  
- I walked for about 30 minutes daily, including during office hours.  
- Since I work in IT and sit at a desk for long hours, I took frequent breaks.  
- My diet remained Indian, but I reduced my calorie intake‚Äîfor example, cutting down from 5 rotis to 2 and eating five smaller meals a day.  
- I allowed myself cheat days on Saturdays and Sundays, and sometimes in between.  
- I completely gave up milk.  
- I fasted on Mondays from morning until evening.  
- At one point, I went into ""hard mode"" for 1-2 months, skipping both breakfast and lunch. This was just a personal preference.  
- I focused on taking multivitamins, calcium, and vitamin D, as my levels were found to be low.  
- I ensured I drank 2-3 liters of water daily.  
- I used to drink alcohol weekly, but now I only drink socially and only after filling half my stomach with food. My limit is a maximum of **2 pegs of whisky (30ml each) or one small pint of beer.**
- I completely gave up cold drinks and sugar. Now, I don‚Äôt even like the taste of sugar‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure why.  
- Most importantly, I followed a **small-step method**, making gradual improvements day by day instead of pushing myself too hard all at once.  
- All medications were prescribed by my doctor, and I only used medical-grade products, not those sold on e-commerce platforms.  

**Important:** Before taking any medication, always consult a doctor‚Äîdo not self-medicate. Throughout this process, I followed my doctor's advice.

My boyfriend and I have recently moved in together after dating for 2 years. I was nervous about moving in together at first, but I was pleasantly surprised how easy and natural it felt to merge our lives together. In a lot of ways, we are very compatible and he makes my life happier. However, recently he has developed a strange habit. I know that it's normal for partners to have habits or idiosyncrasies that might annoy one another, but this is one that I don't know if I can put up with.

It all started when we were watching a survival show together. One of the contestants decided to snack on some ants as a protein source. This caused my boyfriend to wonder what ants taste like, and he became curious to try one. I didn't think much of it at the time because I didn't think he would actually do it.

Well, the next day while we were cooking dinner together, I noticed some ants crawling on the sink. I asked my boyfriend to take care of it, since he is usually the one to kill any bugs in our apartment. To my surprise, instead of killing the ants, my boyfriend popped one of them in his mouth and ate it. I thought this was hilarious and a little gross, and I asked him what it tasted like. He said that it tasted slightly sour, like a lemon-lime flavor, and it wasn't bad. My boyfriend is a bit of a jokester, so I assumed this was just a one-time thing that he did to make me laugh.

The thing is that our apartment has a bit of an ant problem. We've tried everything from ant traps to coffee grounds, but we can't seem to get rid of them. Now, every time my boyfriend sees an ant, instead of killing it he will simply pop it in his mouth. I think this is disgusting, and frankly I don't want to kiss the same mouth that has been eating ants. I know that in some cultures eating ants is perfectly acceptable, but this is just too strange and taboo for me to get used to. I have tried to tell him to stop eating ants, but I've noticed that even after he's said that he would stop, sometimes I catch him doing it when he thinks I'm not looking.

I don't know what to do. Am I being too dramatic?

TLDR: My boyfriend has formed a habit of eating the ants in our apartment and it grosses me out. I don't want to risk ruining our relationship, but I don't think I can put up with his habit. What should I do?

I've been cafe hopping around the community for a while now. I love supporting new and upstart cafes, especially if it is really a passion project of the owners. I consider the price, ambiance and its proximity to my house.

I saw recommendations about Kubli, and decided to go at around 7:30pm.

I tried their iced matcha latte and coffee, and for me it's quite bland. For its price (P150 for 16 oz of iced coffee), I would consider cheaper options in other cafes.

I was hoping to taste something different, as they seem to offer artisan coffee. I was hoping, to some extent, like the cafes around Tagaytay and Amadeo. But this time a cafe that is near.

In peak hours, the location can be hot (as it is an open space with fans) with limited seating capacity. As much as I want to still hang around and appreciate the vibe, there are people that are standing and I left after I finished my drinks. Stayed for a little while, standing, to watch the busking artists.  
  
Nevertheless, I still enjoyed and appreciate the motif of a rustic and a slow bar cafe. Plus there is a busking session.

I hope they can add seating capacities, improve air ventilation and the formula for brewing / making coffee specialties.

What are your thoughts? What are your recommendations if I'm willing to give it another try?

I work for a company with 6 separate business and I‚Äôm essentially a floating employee, I do what‚Äôs needed where it‚Äôs needed. The title is loose, but I guess call it admin and marketing.

¬†The group has had a lot of management problems recently and I‚Äôve sort of been entrusted by the owner to help keep managers on track in places where they‚Äôre failing as support. Manager A complained that they hadn‚Äôt had my help for 8 months (as I was with another one) and that it has halted all their development and profits (this isn‚Äôt true, I‚Äôm not magic, nor that good).

I‚Äôve now been asked to go help Manager A and‚Ä¶ they have nothing. They‚Äôve been waiting all these months blaming their lack of success on me not being there, and they‚Äôve done nothing? They didn‚Äôt need support. They were waiting for me to do their work. They handed me on half a piece of A5 paper and want me to develop it and market it so they can then deliver it. The brief is basically, ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to sell a coffee machine that everyone will like‚Äô. This manager was promoted to business development from HR. This isn‚Äôt a business idea, this is barely a sketch. Nothing further has been done than this, no audience research, no market research, no market segmentation, no plans, no nothing.

I was sent to help Manager B in a different business in the group urgently in the last year to come up with and carry out strategies so that they weren't shut down. This was operational problems, not product. This business was not aware it was at risk of being shut, only myself having been given the task by the owner to turn it round. That's why I couldn't help Manager A. I initially felt bad for Manager A, as they had less support, but now I feel like a fool and like I'm being taken for a ride.

These managers are paid anywhere from ¬£55k to ¬£90k and I‚Äôm low ¬£30k.

I get a lot of satisfaction from my job and doing well, but I suddenly feel like a mug. None of this is any benefit to me. The last one tipped the scales. How did this manager spend 8 months doing nothing waiting for me? And if I‚Äôm creating this product and handing it back to them to deliver, technically aren‚Äôt I their manager? Why am I *this* important?

I‚Äôm not good at negotiating but I‚Äôm getting really fed up. I‚Äôm too unsure to rock the boat, because I can‚Äôt quite tell if I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. At the same time employees joke I should be given other's salaries, which makes me uncomfortable and frustrated.

Has this happened to anyone before? What happened? Is my best shot at resolving this getting a new job to force pay negotiations?",4,1740856760.0,UKJobs,5,0.84,False

About an hour after breakfast, just as promised, the ship appeared on the horizon. Beech took out a long device with a lens at the end of it, and put it up to his eye.

  
  


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs them, alright,‚Äù he said, taking the device down, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre flying the Guild flag.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúDo they know they can‚Äôt approach?‚Äù Sala asked Beech.

  
  


‚ÄúThey would have terrain maps of the shores,‚Äù he explained.

  
  


And predictably, the ship lowered its sails minutes later, then dropped anchor about seven-hundred feet from the shore. A small boat was lowered, and began to row towards the shore. Minutes later, the boat reached the beach, and two men got out of it.

  
  


‚ÄúPhew!‚Äù a thirty-something year-old man with a goatee said, ‚ÄúThat dragon really did a number on this place. I‚Äôm the foreman of this operation. How have you all been doing?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be better now that you‚Äôre here,‚Äù a villager said.

  
  


‚ÄúYou can say that again. Say, who are these dragons?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Bulrush and Ahi,‚Äù Buck said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre our friends, and they‚Äôre going to help us rebuild.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúBrave new world, huh?‚Äù the construction worker said, ‚ÄúHumans and dragons working with each other. Mind you I lost family when that dastardly dragon princess razed Safe Harbor.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really sorry,‚Äù Ahi told him in Human. Seemingly, apologizing for any dragon‚Äôs mistreatment of humans had become a reflex for both her and Bulrush.

  
  


‚ÄúWell, the SandWings‚Äô new Queen is doing everything she can to help us. I‚Äôm not *quite* ready to forgive, but then again, ol‚Äô Blister is six feet under anyhow, so what can I do? Now, let‚Äôs get to work. It‚Äôs gonna take days to get this mess fixed up.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWhat should I do first?‚Äù Bulrush asked the man.

  
  


‚ÄúFly onto our ship and start carrying over lumber,‚Äù he responded, ‚ÄúThe guys on the ship‚Äôll tell you what to grab.‚Äù

  
  


Ahi and Bulrush took off, flying towards the ship. Meanwhile, more construction workers began to arrive on boats, all carrying large toolboxes.

  
  


‚ÄúFirst, we‚Äôre going to have to tear down the wreckage,‚Äù the first worker said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do this part.‚Äù

  
  


The workers approached the scorched ruin and began to take it down with hammers. The sound of breaking wood and wrenching nails filled the island. Soon, Ahi and Bulrush returned, carrying pallets of wood in their talons. They gently set down the materials and immediately went back to get more.

  
  


As the demolition of the wreckage continued, Buck found himself helping any way he could. He was strong for his age, of course, but not nearly as strong as the bulky, hard-working men who came from the ship. He decided to treat this exercise as yet another segment of his Scourge-fighting training, carrying heavy loads from the pallets to the construction site.

  
  


Hours later, the remains of the old village had been taken down, and the rubble and debris piled up onto the boats to be taken to the scrapyard in Safe Harbor.

  
  


‚ÄúNow the real fun begins,‚Äù the foreman said, ‚ÄúTime to build!‚Äù

  
  


The workers chanted ‚Äútime to build!‚Äù back, raising their hands and tools skyward. Clearly these were dedicated workmen. They took their jobs more seriously than Birch did as a Traveler, and that was saying something.

  
  


‚ÄúBut first,‚Äù the foreman said, ‚ÄúLunch.‚Äù

  
  


At that moment one of the boats arrived from the ship, laden with provisions including salted beef, dried fruit, and crackers.

  
  


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had ship food,‚Äù Sala commented as a fire was built to cook the food.

  
  


‚ÄúIs it good?‚Äù Buck asked her.

  
  


‚ÄúSort of. It‚Äôs meant to keep well and keep a person full, not necessarily taste good.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still saying it kind of nostalgically.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúShip food was kind of a treat for us, one of the few times I‚Äôve had things to eat besides fish and fruit.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

  
  


As the food cooked, the villagers, workers and dragons gathered on the beach around the fire. The captain of the ship came over, whom Ahi eyed with amazement. The captain was missing one of his legs from the knee down, with the lost limb replaced by a smoothly varnished wooden peg.

  
  


Buck could guess Ahi was imagining someone from one of her scrolls, and Buck as well remembered reading about peg-legged sailors in his childhood storybooks. The only thing missing was a parrot on his shoulder. He dreaded Ahi trying to ask him how he lost his leg. Buck figured it more than likely involved a SeaWing.

  
  


It seemed like Sala was eyeing the captain as well. The man did not seem to notice, instead sipping a steaming black drink from a large clay mug.

  
  


‚ÄúCoffee,‚Äù Sala mentioned, ‚ÄúFrom the Rainforest Kingdom.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard about it,‚Äù Buck responded, ‚ÄúSome people drink it in Haven.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of an acquired taste,‚Äù Sala said, ‚ÄúReally hot and bitter. But a lot of people say it‚Äôs good for you.‚Äù

  
  


The first round of food was served, and the ravenous workers began taking heaping portions of beef and crackers. Nonetheless, there was plenty to go around. The captain, continuing to be watched by Sala, Buck, and Ahi, seemed to keep to himself, not socializing with his crew or the villagers.

  
  


‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go talk to him,‚Äù Buck said.

  
  


‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Sala tilted her head, ‚ÄúSure, okay. Be careful.‚Äù

  
  


As Buck approached the captain, the main set down his coffee mug and looked up at him. ‚ÄúCan I help you, young man?‚Äù he said inquisitively.

  
  


‚ÄúI just wanted to know‚Ä¶‚Äù he struggled to think of what to say. ‚ÄúWhat it‚Äôs like sailing a ship?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quieter work than you think,‚Äù he said, looking down at his peg leg, ‚ÄúBesides the sailors yelling and the ocean‚Äôs roar, it‚Äôs a solitary life.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúHow far have you been from shore?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúNot far at all. The ocean gets far more dangerous when you leave Pyrrhia. Storms, dragons‚Ä¶ and kraken.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúKraken?‚Äù Buck asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWorse than SeaWings,‚Äù the captain said coldly, ‚ÄúMassive squid with an appetite for anything‚Ä¶ including ships.‚Äù

  
  


Buck swallowed. ‚ÄúThat must be horrifying.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúEven SeaWings have trouble with them, so I‚Äôm told. And unlike dragons, they can‚Äôt be reasoned with. Their only instinct is destruction. In any case, they generally don‚Äôt come too close to land.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúDid he tell ye he lost his leg by one of them?‚Äù a sailor came over, a mischievous smile on his face.

  
  


The captain‚Äôs face briefly flashed with a mix of rage and horror, but quickly simmered back down. ‚ÄúYes. The one time I strayed from shore, we were attacked by two kraken.‚Äù he lowered his head, clearly not wanting to say anything more.

  
  


‚ÄúOoh, ye‚Äôre not gonna give the lad the story?‚Äù the sailor looked disappointed.

  
  


The captain‚Äôs face darkened, grimacing with pain. ‚ÄúI have told you before, midshipman, that I do not like discussing the event. I lost too many good men that day.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúOoh, never mind then.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Buck told the captain, before returning to his meal.

  
  


‚ÄúAnd I thought *you* were the traumatized one,‚Äù Sala said as Buck returned to her side.

  
  


‚ÄúWe had a place to hide,‚Äù Buck said, remembering the worst moment of his life crammed into the wine cellar, ‚ÄúOut in the ocean, they would‚Äôve been helpless.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúTrue.‚Äù

  
  


The food gradually diminished, until everyone was satisfied, and the foreman loudly declared that it was time to return to work.

  
  


‚ÄúHere we go,‚Äù Sala said, ‚ÄúTime to rebuild.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYep,‚Äù Buck said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to help. That ‚Äòship food‚Äô filled me with energy.‚Äù

  
  


Sala giggled. ‚ÄúGo do your thing then.‚Äù

  
  


Buck‚Äôs arms were put to the test, carrying small pieces of lumber after they had been cut down to size. He ferried planks to various huts in the process of being constructed, as the workers nailed them into place.

  
  


‚ÄúHey kid,‚Äù the foreman said as he passed by, ‚ÄúWanna learn something?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Buck nodded, and he approached the foreman, who was holding a hammer.

  
  


When Buck arrived, the hammer was shoved into Buck‚Äôs hand. The foreman pointed to a nail that had only partly been put into two intersecting planks.

  
  


‚ÄúTry to hammer that nail in.‚Äù

  
  


Buck held the hammer up to the nail, pulled it back, then tried to slam it into the nail. The hammer slipped off of the nail and hit the plank instead. The foreman shook his head.

  
  


‚ÄúNah, you gotta tap it gently. Try again. Make little taps.‚Äù

  
  


Buck did as he was told. With each tap, the hammer pushed the nail in slightly, until the head of it was flush with the surface of the plank.

  
  


‚ÄúGood job. Remember, sometimes, raw strength isn‚Äôt effective. Sometimes, it‚Äôs better to be precise.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThanks, foreman,‚Äù Buck smiled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember that.‚Äù *Could come in handy during the Scourge fight,* Buck continued in his head.

  
  


‚ÄúGo back to what you were doing.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù

  
  


The construction continued for the rest of the afternoon, until about five homes had been built. Buck sat on a rock in the rebuilt fire circle, wiping sweat off his brow. He soon found Elm at his side, whose hair had a coating of sawdust on it.

  
  


‚ÄúI see you have been making yourself useful,‚Äù Elm commented as he sat on a neighboring rock.

  
  


‚ÄúSame with you,‚Äù Buck responded, ‚ÄúWhat have you been doing?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúSawing wood to make planks. I must do the same thing to craft stocks for my guns, so I was familiar with how to use a saw.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThis is incredible,‚Äù Buck said, ‚ÄúJust like back in Safe Harbor, everyone, humans *and* dragons, working together to rebuild from a tragedy. Just one question though‚Ä¶ how often will this have to happen?‚Äù

  
  


Elm tilted his head. ‚ÄúExplain?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúLike, there‚Äôs still dragons who want to burn down human settlements. Bramble joined the Scourge just because he felt like it. Are humans going to need defenses for their villages, like what Safe Harbor, Haven, and the Indestructible City have?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúA good question. Unfortunately, I believe that only time will provide an answer. Human-dragon cooperation, as far as history tells it, has never happened before. Everything we are doing is completely new territory.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúOkay then, so say Bramble comes back and tries to burn down this island again. If Bulrush and Ahi don‚Äôt stick around, what would they do?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThat would be the worst case scenario. And there would be no good solution. Everyone on this island is only alive today because of Bulrush and Ahi‚Äôs intervention. When they leave, they will be defenseless again.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThat really sucks, you know? Without having dragons guard us all day and night, we could just be wiped out any moment. What kind of living is that?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWe have lived that way forever,‚Äù Elm said, ‚ÄúHumans, despite being ‚Äòdefenseless,‚Äô have managed to survive in this world *regardless* of dragons. There is pride to take in that.‚Äù

  
  


Buck sighed. ‚ÄúTrue. But it still sucks, to be at the whims of dragons. To only be alive at their will.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWe will manage, as we always have. Now, it seems as if they are preparing for dinner.‚Äù

  
  


Ahi had caught more fish, so mixed in with the ship‚Äôs provisions was a seafood feast. The islanders began to cook. Sala, meanwhile, had taken up helping Beech with the cooking process, helping to gut and descale the fish in preparation for the large cooking fire, with the sizzling pan placed over it.

  
  


The workers began to settle down and join the islanders in salivating over the fish being cooked.

  
  


‚ÄúGood job everyone,‚Äù the foreman announced, ‚ÄúWe got more done today than I predicted. If we keep this up, by this time tomorrow this island will be back in action!‚Äù

  
  


A cheer rose up among the assembled humans, both the islanders and the workers. Ahi and Bulrush smiled as well.

  
  


‚ÄúWith that,‚Äù Beech said, ‚ÄúDinner is served!‚Äù

  
  


Another cheer from everyone, and as the sun began to set on the western shore, everyone gathered for a meal. As he ate, Buck looked to the south to see the Moons beginning to rise. The third one was full.

  
  


‚ÄúI have to‚Ä¶ go do something‚Ä¶‚Äù Buck absentmindedly told Elm, and he stood and began to walk into the forest.

  
  


The skies over Wayfinder‚Äôs Island began to dim as Buck weaved through the trees away from the village. When he felt his arms tingle, he stopped.

Moreau had barely recovered from the emotional minefield of his conversation with Eliara before she insisted they check in on L√≥rien.

It was a convenient distraction‚Äîone Moreau *desperately* needed. L√≥rien was a chaos gremlin with more curiosity than sense, and if she‚Äôd truly been sitting in the galley eating raw flour for *hours*, he owed it to the kitchen staff to ensure she hadn‚Äôt dismantled anything important. Or, worse, started questioning people about their ""bonding rituals.""

Eliara walked beside him, arms loosely folded, her presence *different* in a way Moreau couldn‚Äôt quite adjust to. It wasn‚Äôt just the realism of her projection, the way her skin had warmth or how she *breathed* now‚Äîsomething unnecessary but eerie in its perfection. It was the fact that her presence wasn‚Äôt just digital anymore. It wasn‚Äôt confined to his thoughts or a hardlight projection.

She *existed* in a way she hadn‚Äôt before.

And yet, as they walked, he saw something even stranger.

There were moments when her feet didn‚Äôt quite touch the ground.

One second, she walked normally, the faint sound of her footsteps aligning with his own. The next, she would drift‚Äîjust *slightly*, just enough for the laws of physics to take offense. Her hair moved like it was being affected by the ship‚Äôs gravity, yet *she* was not always entirely subject to it.

He caught it happening again as they neared the galley.

Moreau stopped walking. ‚ÄúEliara.‚Äù

She glanced at him, mid-step. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

He gestured vaguely at her entire existence. ‚ÄúAre you *floating*?‚Äù

Eliara blinked and looked down at her feet. She was, indeed, a few centimeters off the ground.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Oh,‚Äù she said, mildly.

Moreau pinched the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúYou *just* figured that out?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was thinking about walking,‚Äù Eliara said, lowering herself so that she was properly grounded again. ‚ÄúI suppose I wasn‚Äôt entirely *committed* to it.‚Äù

Moreau scowled. ‚ÄúDo you‚Äîdo you even *have* mass? Or is this some kind of quantum nonsense?‚Äù

Eliara tilted her head, thoughtful. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Moreau groaned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is absolutely an answer.‚Äù

He muttered something unkind under his breath before shaking his head. ‚ÄúJust‚Äîplease, don‚Äôt start phasing through walls or defying physics too much until I *process* this.‚Äù

Eliara smirked. ‚ÄúI make no promises.‚Äù

Moreau sighed but continued walking, making a mental note to *ask her later* how she was even *doing* this. If she had full control over her form, was she even bound to the ship anymore?

The thought made something in his chest *tighten*.

He pushed it aside as they stepped into the galley. It was quieter than expected.

Moreau stepped inside first, immediately noting the lack of catastrophe. No exploded machinery, no confused or distressed crew‚Äîjust a few off-duty officers chatting, a handful of kitchen staff cleaning up, and in the farthest corner, their ***guest***.

L√≥rien sat at one of the tables, elbows resting on the surface. Small bowls of various raw ingredients‚Äîflour, sugar, salt, uncooked rice, coffee grounds‚Äîwere neatly arranged, and she was meticulously studying them as though determining the fundamental nature of reality. Staring at a small plate set in the center with various raw ingredients in what could only be described as a *science experiment* laid out before her with the same intensity one might reserve for a classified intelligence report. A thin dusting of flour covered the immediate area, and beside her, a crew member looked equally fascinated and horrified.

As they approached, the crew member took one look at Moreau, then at Eliara, *blinked, once, twice, three times*, and then quickly and quietly excused himself.

Moreau watched as L√≥rien, oblivious of their approach, picked up a spoonful of plain cornstarch, tapped it against her fingers, then, with great reverence, *licked it*.

L√≥rien blinked very slowly, then with a barely audible sigh, frowned.

‚Äú*This is disappointing,*‚Äù she declared solemnly.

Moreau exhaled. ‚ÄúL√≥rien.‚Äù

The Firstborn‚Äôs golden gaze lifted immediately. At first, she seemed pleased to see them, but then she *really* looked at Eliara.

Her face barely changed.

She smiled.

‚Äú*Ah. You have reconciled.*‚Äù

Moreau stopped mid-step, blinking. Eliara raised an eyebrow.

The Firstborn finally looked up, golden eyes flicking between the two of them with a small knowing smile. ‚Äú*Good.*‚Äù Then, without missing a beat, she picked up another pinch of flour from the table and placed it on her tongue, seemingly analyzing the taste as if it contained the secrets of the universe.

Moreau stared. Then frowned. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem surprised.‚Äù

L√≥rien gave him a flat look. ‚Äú*Why would I be?*‚Äù

Moreau gestured vaguely at Eliara. ‚ÄúThis.‚Äù

L√≥rien gave him a slightly pitying look. ‚Äú*Mathias Moreau*,‚Äù she said, like she was addressing a slow child, ‚Äú*she has* ***always*** *looked like that.*‚Äù

Moreau opened his mouth, but no words came out.

Eliara, to his mild *irritation*, seemed *amused*.

‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù Eliara murmured, looking down at herself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always seen me like this?‚Äù

L√≥rien nodded. ‚Äú*Of course. Why would I not?*‚Äù

Moreau *gestured wildly* between Eliara and the air. ‚ÄúBecause *she wasn‚Äôt like this before*!‚Äù

L√≥rien cocked her head. ‚Äú*She was. You simply could not perceive it.*‚Äù

Moreau glared at Eliara. ‚ÄúWere you like this the whole time?‚Äù

Eliara‚Äôs expression turned *mischievous*. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

Moreau groaned. ‚ÄúI *hate* this.‚Äù

L√≥rien took another lick of cornstarch, completely unfazed. ‚ÄúY*our perception was limited before. But now, you see her as she is.* ***That is good***.‚Äù She gave Moreau a pleased nod. ‚Äú*You are finally catching up.*‚Äù

‚ÄúI *hate* this,‚Äù Moreau repeated.

L√≥rien‚Äôs golden gaze twinkled. ‚Äú*You seem to say that often when you are confronted with emotions.*‚Äù

Moreau ran a hand down his face. ‚ÄúWhy are you *like this*?‚Äù

L√≥rien shrugged. ‚Äú*I am the* ***Youngest***.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a *reason*.‚Äù

‚Äú*It absolutely is,*‚Äù she countered, completely serious.

Eliara, *definitely enjoying this*, took a seat across from L√≥rien. ‚ÄúSo. You‚Äôve been eating flour.‚Äù

L√≥rien sighed, poking at a small pile of sugar. ‚Äú*I had assumed that taste was tied to meaning. I have discovered that this is false. Flour has no meaning that I can determine. It simply exists.*‚Äù

Eliara smirked. ‚ÄúA disappointing revelation?‚Äù

‚Äú***Very***.‚Äù L√≥rien finished another slow taste of something Moreau couldn‚Äôt quite identify, then folded her hands. ‚Äú*I wish to understand the experience of flavor. It is not necessary for sustenance, but the concept of texture, of nuance‚Äîit intrigues me.*‚Äù She paused, then nodded toward Eliara. ‚Äú*Much like how you intrigue me.*‚Äù

Eliara straightened slightly, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúBecause of my new projection?‚Äù

L√≥rien hummed. ‚Äú*Because you are here.*‚Äù She tilted her head. ‚Äú*You were always here, but now you are more.*‚Äù

Moreau exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúAnd that means?‚Äù

L√≥rien studied Eliara for a moment, then reached forward, carefully plucking a single grain of rice from one of her many plates. She held it between two fingers, turning it slightly as if examining every molecule. ‚Äú*A grain of sand and a mountain are made of the same thing, yes? But one is perceived as small, the other vast. One is dismissed, the other impossible to ignore. Yet, they are not truly different.*‚Äù She placed the grain down. ‚Äú*You have always been the mountain, Eliara. Mathias Moreau simply lacked the sight to see it.*‚Äù

Moreau resisted the urge to groan. ‚ÄúEvery conversation with you makes me feel like I‚Äôm on the losing side of a philosophy debate.‚Äù

L√≥rien beamed. ‚Äú*That is because you are.*‚Äù

Eliara, for her part, simply sat back, arms crossing. ‚ÄúI *feel* more present.‚Äù Her fingers tapped against her arm in thought. ‚ÄúBut I can still‚Ä¶ shift.‚Äù

L√≥rien‚Äôs gaze sharpened slightly. ‚Äú*Show me.*‚Äù

Eliara hesitated, then, without standing, *floated*.

It was seamless‚Äîlike stepping off the ground without effort, her form gliding slightly above the floor as if gravity had never been a concern for her. And then, just as easily, she shifted back, her body settling onto the chair with perfect weight.

Moreau *stared*.

Eliara looked at her hands again, voice quieter. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ That was strange.‚Äù

L√≥rien nodded, seeming pleased. ‚Äú*You are both here and not. Anchored and unbound. Fascinating.*‚Äù

Moreau exhaled, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúThis is going to take some getting used to.‚Äù

L√≥rien grinned at him. ‚Äú*It is very simple, Mathias Moreau. You are Bonded to a being greater than you understand.*‚Äù

Moreau shot her a glare. ‚ÄúI ***know***.‚Äù

L√≥rien blinked innocently. ‚Äú*But it is true.*‚Äù

Eliara smiled happily, leaning slightly toward Moreau, cheeks darkening a little. ‚ÄúYou *did* say it.‚Äù

He groaned. ‚Äú*You* told me to.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could have refused.‚Äù

‚ÄúI *could*, but I enjoy my sanity.‚Äù

Eliara‚Äôs smile widened.

L√≥rien, watching them, suddenly sighed and placed a piece of fruit in her mouth. ‚Äú*You are exhausting.*‚Äù

Moreau scoffed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one to talk.‚Äù

L√≥rien chewed thoughtfully, swallowed, and then, after a moment, announced, ‚Äú*I like apples.*‚Äù

Moreau, deciding to pretend none of this was happening, sat down beside Eliara and rubbed his temples. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve stayed in bed.‚Äù

L√≥rien brightened suddenly. ‚Äú*Ah! Yes! Beds!*‚Äù She leaned forward eagerly. ‚Äú*I have acquired a blanket! I have* ***not yet*** *dismantled it!*‚Äù

Moreau blinked. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ is actually impressive.‚Äù

L√≥rien nodded. ‚Äú*I have, however,* ***considered*** *dismantling it.*‚Äù

Moreau sighed. ‚ÄúI take it back.‚Äù

Eliara chuckled, but her gaze softened as she watched L√≥rien. ‚ÄúHave you been settling in well?‚Äù

L√≥rien nodded. ‚Äú*It is‚Ä¶ different. This ship is loud, but not unpleasantly so. And I do not mind your people.*‚Äù She hesitated, then looked between them. ‚Äú*And you?*‚Äù

Eliara glanced at Moreau before smiling. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre adjusting.‚Äù

Moreau grumbled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm *adjusting* to my entire reality being rewritten.‚Äù

L√≥rien gave him another one of those *pitying* looks. ‚Äú*Yes. You are* ***very slow.***‚Äù

Moreau scowled. ‚ÄúYou *ate flour*.‚Äù

L√≥rien gasped in shock. ‚Äú*Do not* ***shame*** *my learning process!*‚Äù

Eliara outright *giggled*‚Äîshe ***giggled***.

Moreau just leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes with a long sigh.

**Deacon Dionisius Akhalashvili @ Foma.Ru**



One day I was asked to write an article for the monastery newspaper, and I was jittery and exhausted, I had no strength, no mood, everything was literally falling out of my hands. I realized that in such a state I could not do the work, and it was impossible to refuse, the editorial office called me, it was necessary to submit the newspaper to the press. In general, everything is sad. 

In the evening I got a call from a priest-hieromonk I knew, and I told him about my problems. He listened to me and said: ‚ÄúYou know, Father Dionysius, fatigue in spiritual life is a common thing. To succeed, you need to be able not only to mobilize, but also to relax. Remember Abba Anthony. One hunter saw how he jokingly treated his brothers, and thought that such behavior for a monk is unacceptable. Then the monk gave him a bow and said: ‚Äú Stretch it!‚Äù He did. ‚Äú Stretch it more!‚Äù He stretched it harder. ‚Äú Stretch it more!‚Äù The man said: ‚ÄúIf I stretch the bow any more, it will break"". Abba said to him, ‚ÄúSo it is in the work of God. If you exert yourself too much all the time, you will break.""

When you are exhausted in body and soul, do not try hard to lead a normal rhythm of life, take a break. Let the problems go, they're not going anywhere.

Or better yet, make fragrant tea or aromatic coffee, put it on a beautiful tray next to you, sit in a comfortable chair and just quietly recite the prayer, as if you were looking at a tree rustling its leaves in the warm sunny wind. Listen to this rustling as music filled with silence and peace, feel how beautiful it is.

Or in the hour of fatigue, sit on the bank of the river. Let your prayer be like looking at the water running on the rocks, without tension, freely and easily. The murmur of the water is its speech, its music that glorifies the Creator. Try to feel its quiet joy. And then these simple unsophisticated images, like many other things that life offers us, will fill your soul with peace and hope, will give you strength to create and follow the chosen path.""

The next day early in the morning I made coffee, poured a lot of cream, and drank it with pleasure, taking my time. And then went to the nature to my favorite places on the river bank, where we often go with my family on weekends. I left all my problems and worries there, at my desk, and now I was just walking and praying quietly, enjoying the fall views and the clear piercing air. I was in nature for about two hours, and when I got home, I felt as if I had returned from vacation, relaxed and rested. 

Already in the evening the article was in the editorial office. When my family returned, they couldn't understand for a long time why usually tired dad was smiling happily and ready to carry everyone in his arms.",2,1740856510.0,SophiaWisdomOfGod,0,1.0,False

Jenny scrolled through movies for a while before settling on a comedy. ""This one‚Äôs supposed to be good,"" she said, pressing play without even checking if I agreed.

Not that I would‚Äôve disagreed. She was in charge now.

We sat in silence for the first few minutes, the only sounds coming from the TV. I was still hyper-aware of the cage, of the weight of the key around Jenny‚Äôs neck, of how close she was sitting next to me. My mind wasn‚Äôt on the movie at all‚ÄîI was too busy overanalyzing every small movement she made.

About ten minutes in, Jenny sighed. ""Ugh. I want popcorn.""

I opened my mouth to suggest she go get some, but before I could say anything, she turned to me with a knowing smile. ""You go get it.""

I blinked. ""Me?""

""Yeah. And a soda, too. Actually, no‚Äîget me a juice. The mango one in the fridge.""

I hesitated for a second too long because Jenny‚Äôs smile widened. ""Did you forget already?"" she said, tapping the key against her chest.

I swallowed. ""N-no, I‚Äî I‚Äôll go get it.""

Jenny giggled. ""Good boy.""

I stood up quickly and left the room, my face burning.

As I walked to the kitchen, I replayed the moment in my head. It was just popcorn. Just a drink. It should‚Äôve been normal. But the way she said it, the way she looked at me‚Äîshe knew what she was doing. She was making me obey.

And I was letting her.

I grabbed the mango juice from the fridge and threw a bag of popcorn into the microwave. As I waited, I glanced toward the hallway, my mind drifting back to Mrs. Thompson.

The key. The way she looked at me. Did she know?

The microwave beeped, snapping me out of my thoughts. I poured the popcorn into a bowl and carried everything back to Jenny‚Äôs room.

She barely looked up as I walked in. ""Took you long enough.""

I held out the popcorn and drink, expecting her to take them, but she didn‚Äôt move. Instead, she gave me an innocent smile. ""Oh, just hold them for me.""

I blinked. ""Huh?""

Jenny stretched out, getting more comfortable. ""I don‚Äôt want to put them on the bed. You hold them for me.""

I stood there for a second, processing what she had just said. She wanted me to hold them? The entire movie?

Jenny must‚Äôve seen my hesitation because she tilted her head. ""Problem?""

I shook my head quickly. ""N-no, of course not.""

""Good."" She reached into the bowl, grabbing a handful of popcorn without taking her eyes off the screen. ""See? You‚Äôre getting the hang of this already.""

I swallowed hard, shifting my weight. My arms were already starting to feel the strain of holding everything, but I didn‚Äôt dare complain.

I just stood there, holding Jenny‚Äôs popcorn and drink, while she enjoyed the movie like nothing was out of the ordinary.

And somehow, I knew this was just the beginning.

I stood there, arms already aching, as Jenny lazily picked at the popcorn. She was completely absorbed in the movie, acting like this was the most normal thing in the world.

Five minutes passed. Then ten.

I shifted my weight from foot to foot, adjusting my grip on the bowl. My arms were burning. I wanted to ask if I could set it down somewhere, but I didn‚Äôt dare. Not after the way she had looked at me earlier.

Jenny reached for her juice, her fingers brushing mine as she took it from my hands. She sipped slowly, her eyes never leaving the screen. Then, just as I thought she might take pity on me and let me sit down, she casually placed the bottle back in my hands like I was a living table.

My throat went dry.

She knew exactly what she was doing.

Jenny reached into the bowl again, grabbing another handful of popcorn before pausing. ""Wait, this is kind of boring.""

I blinked. ""The movie?""

""No, you."" She turned to look at me, eyes twinkling with amusement. ""You just standing there like a statue. It‚Äôs cute, but I think we can make this a little more fun.""

I swallowed hard. ""H-how?""

Jenny smirked, sitting up a little straighter. ""Take off your shirt.""

My heart stopped. ""W-what?""

""You heard me."" She popped another piece of popcorn into her mouth. ""Shirt. Off. Now.""

I hesitated for half a second too long. Jenny‚Äôs smirk deepened. ""Do I need to remind you who has the key?""

I shook my head quickly. ""N-no, I just‚Äî""

""Then do it.""

I could barely breathe as I set the juice down on her nightstand and awkwardly tried to pull my shirt off with one hand while still holding the popcorn. My fingers fumbled, and Jenny just watched, clearly enjoying my struggle.

Finally, I managed to yank the shirt over my head, my face burning.

Jenny‚Äôs eyes slowly dragged down my body, making my skin prickle. ""Hmm. Not bad.""

Then, to my complete shock, she reached for the hem of her shirt.

I froze as she pulled it up over her head in one smooth motion, revealing a simple black bra underneath. She tossed the shirt onto the bed casually, then smirked at me. ""There. Now it‚Äôs fair.""

I had no idea how to react. My brain short-circuited.

Jenny giggled. ""Relax, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôve never seen a bra before."" She stretched her arms over her head, completely unbothered, before flopping back onto her pillows. ""But something‚Äôs still missing."" She tapped her chin, pretending to think. Then her face lit up. ""Oh! I know. Kneel.""

I choked on air. ""What?""

Jenny giggled. ""Kneel. You‚Äôve been standing too long anyway, and I don‚Äôt want you towering over me. So get down on your knees, and then you can keep holding my snacks.""

I hesitated. My legs felt weak, my heart pounding in my chest. She was really doing this. She was really making me do this.

But she just sat there, smiling sweetly, waiting.

And then‚Äîslowly, shamefully‚ÄîI lowered myself onto my knees.

Jenny beamed. ""Aww, good boy."" She reached out, running her fingers through my hair like I was some kind of pet. ""See? You can learn.""

I clenched my jaw, my face on fire, but I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just stayed there, kneeling at her bedside, holding her popcorn and juice like the obedient little servant she was turning me into.

Jenny giggled, clearly satisfied. Then, like nothing had happened, she turned back to the movie. ""Okay, now we can keep watching.""

And just like that, I realized‚Äî

I wasn‚Äôt just following orders anymore.

I was falling.

The movie eventually ended, though I barely remembered any of it. My mind had been too occupied‚Äîby the weight of the popcorn in my arms, the way Jenny‚Äôs fingers casually brushed against me whenever she grabbed another handful, the way she stretched, her bare skin illuminated by the glow of the screen.

I had never felt so powerless. And yet, I didn‚Äôt want it to stop.

Jenny yawned, stretching her arms above her head before lazily turning toward me. ""Well, that was fun."" She smirked. ""For me, at least. How are your arms?""

I swallowed hard. ""F-fine.""

""Aww, such a strong little servant,"" she teased, reaching out to poke my arm before giggling. ""Okay, you can put everything down now.""

I let out a breath of relief as I placed the empty popcorn bowl and drink on her nightstand. My muscles ached, but I wouldn‚Äôt have dared complain.

Jenny sat up, brushing some crumbs off her stomach. ""I guess you can go home now. But first...""

She leaned in closer, her face just inches from mine. My breath hitched.

She reached for the necklace, lifting the key slightly so it dangled in front of my face. ""You know, I could keep you here all night if I wanted to.""

I stared at the key, my heart hammering. The thought of staying‚Äîof being completely under her control for even longer‚Äîsent a rush of heat through my body.

""But I suppose I should let you go,"" she continued, tilting her head in fake consideration. ""Wouldn't want your parents to worry. Or maybe I should call them and tell them you're sleeping over...""

My stomach flipped. Was she joking? Was she serious? I couldn't tell anymore.

Jenny giggled at my expression, then suddenly flicked my forehead. ""Relax, dummy. Go home before I do change my mind.""

I scrambled to my feet, nearly tripping in my rush to grab my shirt. I was about to pull it on when Jenny snatched it from my hands.

""Actually..."" She held it up, inspecting it like it was the most interesting thing in the world. ""I think I‚Äôll keep this for now. You don‚Äôt really need it, do you?""

I hesitated. ""B-but‚Äî""

She gave me a look.

I shut my mouth.

Jenny grinned. ""Good boy. Now, off you go.""

She practically pushed me out of her room, shutting the door behind me before I could say anything else.

The walk home felt surreal.

The cool night air against my bare skin should have grounded me, but instead, I felt like I was floating. My body still buzzed with the echoes of her touch, her words, her teasing smirks.

My arms still ached from holding her snacks.

My chest still burned from embarrassment.

And yet‚ÄîI had never been happier.

This was real. This was happening.

Jenny was everything I had ever wanted‚Äîbeautiful, confident, playful, and completely in control. And now, somehow, I was the one she was playing with.

I had been obsessed with her before. But now?

I was in love.

And I couldn‚Äôt wait to see what she had planned for me next.

I woke up feeling like I was still dreaming.

Everything from last night replayed in my head on a loop‚Äîthe way Jenny had toyed with me, the way she had taken control, the way she had looked at me like I belonged to her. My whole body felt light, like I was floating in some kind of blissful haze.

Then my phone buzzed.

Jenny: Morning, cutie. Bring me a caramel macchiato and a blueberry scone before school. üòä

I blinked at the screen.

Me: Wait, you start at 8, right?

Jenny: Duh. That‚Äôs why I need it before then.

Me: I don‚Äôt have class until 1‚Ä¶

Jenny: Yeah, I know. But I want my coffee. And my scone. So be a good boy and bring it to me, okay? üíï

I stared at my phone, feeling my heart race a little.

She was really making me do this.

Dragging myself out of bed, I checked the time. If I wanted to get to school before her first class, I had to leave now.

I quickly threw on some normal clothes, but my brain was still a little foggy from the weird, wonderful night before. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as I left my house, clutching my wallet and phone.

I stood in line at the caf√©, surrounded by early morning commuters and students who were actually up for classes. It felt a bit ridiculous. I ordered Jenny‚Äôs drink and scone, fighting the urge to get something for myself. She hadn‚Äôt said I could.

By the time I made it to school, my hands were freezing from the coffee cup. Jenny was waiting near the entrance, scrolling on her phone like she had all the time in the world.

She looked up when she saw me and grinned. ""Aww, you actually did it. Good boy.""

My stomach flipped at the praise.

She took the coffee and scone from my hands, inspecting them. ""Hmm. Still warm. You did rush here, didn‚Äôt you?"" She smirked and took a sip of her coffee, letting out a satisfied sigh. ""Perfect.""

I felt stupidly proud.

Jenny looked me up and down, her eyes playful. ""You know, you really didn‚Äôt have to go through all this trouble for me.""

I stared at her, my mouth slightly dry. ""I‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mind.""

She smiled sweetly, as though she was pleased with my answer. ""Of course you didn‚Äôt."" She took another bite of the scone, humming as she chewed.

Then, just as I thought she was done, she looked up again, her eyes sparkling mischievously. ""You know,"" she started slowly, ""it‚Äôs kind of cute how much you‚Äôre willing to do for me. I could get used to this.""

I froze, my heart beating faster.

Jenny stepped closer, holding her coffee cup with both hands. ""Maybe next time, you could bring me lunch instead.""

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh nervously. ""Sure, anything you want.""

""Good boy,"" she murmured, giving me a teasing smile before taking another sip of her coffee.

And just like that, she turned and walked away, leaving me standing there, barely able to process everything.

I couldn‚Äôt help but smile to myself as I walked away.

It was getting harder to ignore the way she made me feel‚Äîlike I‚Äôd do anything to please her, anything to make her happy.

And, oddly enough, I was so happy to be in this position.

It was another one of those afternoons where the air felt fresh and the world seemed just a little bit more alive. I was eager to see Jenny again, but this time, things felt different. She had texted me to meet her at The Corner Diner, and I was more than happy to oblige, even though I didn‚Äôt quite know what to expect.

Jenny: Meet me at The Corner Diner at 5. Don‚Äôt forget to bring your car‚Äîneed a ride back home. It‚Äôs far out, and no buses go there.

That‚Äôs when my stomach did a little flip. She wanted me to drive her home? It felt so casual, so natural coming from her, but a part of me couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if there was something else going on.

After a quick rush to get to the diner, I pulled into the parking lot and saw Jenny and DANIEL standing near the entrance. Jenny's face lit up with that infectious smile she always had when she was around him. They had finished their meal, and now they were just standing there, chatting like old friends. But it was more than that.

They looked comfortable with each other, laughing, standing closer than normal. They seemed like they were in their own little world.

I approached, trying to keep my face neutral. Jenny noticed me first, her eyes lighting up when she saw me. ""Hey!"" she called out, waving in her usual carefree way. ""I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd get here this quick!""

""Yeah, well, I wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt keep you waiting,"" I replied, forcing a casual smile. But inside, my stomach was twisting.

Jenny turned to Daniel and smiled. ""This is Daniel, by the way. You know him from math, right?""

I nodded stiffly, feeling a pang of something I couldn‚Äôt name. ""Yeah. I know him.""

""Nice to meet you, man,"" Daniel said, his voice warm and friendly. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice the weird tension that I was already feeling. ""You‚Äôre giving us a ride home, right?""

I was caught off guard by the sudden mention of it, and my mouth went a little dry. ""Uh, yeah... sure.""

Jenny grinned, clearly pleased. ""Awesome. I could use a ride, and Daniel lives a little out of the way, so it works out."" She turned back to Daniel, her hand brushing against his arm in a way that made my stomach tighten even more.

We headed to my car, and I tried to shake off the uncomfortable feeling that had settled in. Jenny climbed into the backseat, her laughter filling the air as she and Daniel kept chatting away.

As I drove, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I was just a bystander in their conversation. They were flirting with each other‚Äîplayful comments, teasing remarks‚Äîand I was the silent third wheel.

At one point, Daniel made a joke, and Jenny let out a laugh, her hand reaching over to lightly touch his arm. I felt an unexpected heat rush to my face, but I kept my eyes firmly on the road.

The car felt small, cramped, like I wasn‚Äôt even in control of the situation. Jenny was so effortlessly at ease, and Daniel... well, he just seemed to enjoy the attention. I kept my hands tight on the steering wheel, my knuckles white.

We reached Daniel‚Äôs place first, and I pulled over. He got out without much fanfare, giving a quick wave to both of us. ""Thanks for the ride, man,"" Daniel said with a smile. ""See you later, Jenny.""

""See you, Daniel,"" Jenny replied, her voice still light and easy.

The door shut behind him with a soft thud, and for a brief moment, it was just me and Jenny in the car again.

Jenny‚Äôs mood shifted instantly. She moved from the backseat and slid into the front passenger seat with a fluid grace, closing the door behind her.

I felt a little lighter‚Äîno more awkward tension between the three of us‚Äîbut then she turned to face me, her lips curling into a teasing smile.

""So, I guess you were my chauffeur for my little date with Daniel, huh?"" she said, her voice light and playful. ""I‚Äôm sure you enjoyed that, didn‚Äôt you?""

My stomach did a flip, my mind suddenly racing. ""I‚ÄîI was just driving you home.""

Jenny raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms in a way that made her even more captivating. ""Uh-huh. Sure, you were."" Her tone was full of mock sweetness, like she was amused by my reaction.

She leaned in closer, her breath warm against my ear. ""It‚Äôs cute, though. You‚Äôre the perfect little chauffeur. I bet you didn‚Äôt mind running errands for me like that, did you?""

I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. ""No... no, it was fine.""

Jenny‚Äôs smile grew, and she shifted in her seat to get a better look at me, her eyes locking with mine. ""I‚Äôm sure it was. You‚Äôd do anything for me, wouldn‚Äôt you?""

I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. ""Of course.""

Poor coffee results from my machine 

I got a great deal on a returned machine for ¬£266 shipped which convinced me to move away from my standard nespresso machine but either my machine is no good or I am rubbish at making coffee. 

I suspect it‚Äôs me but I‚Äôve watched the official video and I just can‚Äôt get a good creama no matter what I try.

Also the pressure goes off the chart every time 
I‚Äôve tried low grind setting and high grind setting and tamping light or hard doesn‚Äôt seem to make much of a difference either. 

Is there a complete beginners guide ? 

I also don‚Äôt get how much coffee should be in the actual holder too nor how I should use the razor thing? 

I have noticed when I run the machine the water doesn‚Äôt flow from the extraction evenly it seems to be stronger on 2 sides rather than all of them.

I‚Äôve included some pics on the post of my efforts. 

I am using store bought coffee not freshly roasted as I need to find some but I still can‚Äôt believe it would be this bad.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

Pallet room decor has emerged as a popular choice for those looking to enhance their interior spaces with creativity and sustainability. Utilizing wooden pallets as a base for unique decor pieces not only offers an eco-friendly option but also brings a rustic charm to any room. Here are some inspiring ideas for using pallets in your home decor.

One popular application is creating pallet furniture. Pallet sofas and coffee tables are simple to make and can be customized to fit any aesthetic. By sanding and staining or painting the pallets, you can transform them into chic seating arrangements that serve as focal points in your living area. Pallet shelves also provide a functional yet stylish way to display books, plants, or collectibles.

Wall art is another appealing aspect of pallet room decor. Pallet boards can be arranged to create rustic wall hangings or even entire feature walls. You can paint or attach pictures, mirrors, or other decor items to these boards, providing a unique backdrop for your personal style.

Don‚Äôt forget about outdoor spaces. Using pallets, you can craft garden benches, planters, or even outdoor bars. These versatile structures can easily withstand the elements, offering a stylish way to enhance your patio or garden area.

To add a personal touch, consider incorporating text or inspirational quotes by painting them directly onto pallet surfaces. This method not only conveys your personality but also adds meaningful decor that resonates with your style.

The versatility and affordability of pallet room decor make it a remarkable choice for anyone eager to embrace a DIY approach. With these creative ideas, you can effortlessly transform your space into a haven of style and sustainability, making a statement that feels both personal and inviting.

1j16o36,https://www.reddit.com/r/iwatchedanoldmovie/comments/1j16o36/the_sniper_1952/,The Sniper (1952),"Stanley Kramer's ""The Sniper"", directed by Edward Dmytryk, is like a bookend for Don Siegel's Dirty Harry which came out 20 years later.  Both films showcase San Francisco and both open with a sniper targeting a woman in his crosshairs. But their sensibilities are polar opposites.  Siegel's sniper enjoys killing while Kramer's sniper is a tortured soul who loathes himself yet is unable to control his violent impulses.  This is an early example of a socially conscious  ""message"" film.  In the early '50s, mental health services were only available to the very wealthy, or the prison population.  The Sniper, ""Eddie"", played by Arthur Franz tries to contact his former prison psychiatrist unsuccessfully.  He writes a letter to the police begging them to stop him.  It is alluded that he was abused by his mother.  His weapon of choice, the M1A1 carbine was used in WWII and the Korean War, suggesting he was also a veteran, perhaps traumatized in combat.

After WWII the major studios had financial difficulties and rented out their equipment and unused sound stages, allowing independent producers, like Kramer, to make their own low budget films.  Location shooting was part of that cost saving equation.  Siegel used helicopters to great effect in Dirty Harry but they are not here.  We see San Francisco in its heyday as a blue collar manufacturing town, more like Pittsburgh or Milwaukee, than the cultural mecca it later became.  There is a coffee factory around where the Transamerica Building now stands.  It's also a city on the verge of the Beatniks.  One interesting location is the Paper Doll Club, perhaps the first openly gay bar in America.  The awesome Marie Windsor (B-movie scream queen) performs there as a pianist and is the first victim.  Violent murders in film don't appeal to me but the way she is hit outside the bar and smashes the glass case behind her is sudden and shocking.  It wakes us up.  Most of the film is shot around Telegraph Hill.  There is a moving scene where Eddie comes upon kids playing stick ball in the street.  He tries to join the game but instead awkwardly disrupts it.  He's scolded by a young girl and we can feel his pain and isolation as he slinks away.  He wants to join and belong but he just can't.

Fans of the Grateful Dead might enjoy Eddie's climactic flight through the docks (memorialized in their song Wharf Rat). It was later redeveloped into the tourist haven, Fisherman's Wharf.  The final showdown includes a large crowd of real SF citizens.  Forgive me, but I get a kick out of these glimpses of reality from the past.

Otherwise it is a police procedural with Adolph Menjou and Gerald Mohr investigating.  There is some psychobabble dialog, probably cutting edge at the time.  There is also a semi-comical police lineup which became a familiar fillm trope...this might be its origin.  Adolph Menjou, a well known political conservative was asked how he could work with Edward Dmytryk, a member of the Hollywood Ten blacklisted for alleged communist sympathies.

Three options for renting:

To rent both available bedrooms, full bath, and off-street parking space: Rent $1450, Utilities $75-$150/month

To rent 1 bedroom and off-street parking space and share full bath: Rent $800, Utilities $50-$100/month

To rent 1 bedroom, no parking space (but available visitor parking) and share full bath: Rent $700, Utilities $50-100/month

Both bedrooms have large closets and the full bath has a shower and tub. I (the other roommate) spend most of my time in the basement and my bedroom separate from the two you would be renting, so the huge living room and back patio will frequently be open for you to use. I have a full bath of my own and won‚Äôt be sharing yours.

The location:

Set in a quiet community a 1-minute walk from a 17k bus stop for easy commuting to DC, a 5-minute drive to a VRE station (which has a farmers market on weekends when the weather is warm), and a few minutes drive from supermarkets, coffee shops, restaurants, parks and a brewery.

The roommate:

I am a tidy, laid back, respectful, professional new to DMV. I'm out of the home most days so the space also provides privacy for those who spend time at home during the week.

This past week was a hard week for her interviewing for 7 residencies (jobs). She suffers from anxiety which didn't help her and would lashed out at me when I would ask her how they went. I made sure in between her interviews to get her food, coffee and quiet space. She would expect me to help her correct her PowerPoints and with her assignments that the interviews provided to her to complete even though I didn't know the material. She got sick during that week and I was taking care of her and giving her medicine. When trying to talk, I couldn't hear her and she would get mad for making her repeat herself since her throat was hurting even though she had to do a lot of talking during her interviews.

I feel like I am trying my best to take care of her and be supportive but I feel disrespected by her behavior and unappreciated. What sucks is that she has always complained that I don't put effort in the relationship, etc. Fast forward to now, her birthday is next week and wants me to go see her this weekend. Only thing is, I had to go to a different city for school stuff and we are now 3-4 hours apart by car and I am constantly busy studying. She doesn't have a car at the moment. I don't know if it was okay for me to compromise seeing her halfway but she said she shouldn't be doing that since its almost her birthday which I guess I understand? Idk.

Even typing this out right now has my stomach in knots. I feel like this has as much to do with who I am as a person as it does the downfalls in our relationship. So just a quick run down on me. I lived a very wild, hectic, chaotic, and traumatic life before I met my boyfriend, so much so that there are years of my life that I don't even remember. I have lived so many lives in my life. For example, I was a whole criminal just out being wild, then one day woke up and decided I wanted to be famous. Six months later I had a massive online following, started modeling, was on the covers of magazines, had been in three movies, and almost started dating an A-list celebrity but chickened out and ghosted him. I threw that life away when I met my now boyfriend because he told me I was an attention seeker so I got pissed deleted all my social media accounts and ghosted my manager and agent. I'm a very determined person who can always find the silver lining in every situation, and I have never been afraid to start over, but now walking away from this relationship wouldn't just affect my boyfriend and me. My dad traveled for work and had convinced me to come work for him, and I took him up on the offer because I could still do everything I was before, while also bringing in more money, it was a no brainer. My boyfriend worked with my dad and that's how we met. Because the job was traveling, our relationship just started out as something fun, I was 21 and wild and he was 39 and just separated from his now ex-wife. The first three years of our relationship were long distance, we lived on opposite sides of the country. We would be with each other at work for a couple of weeks to a couple of months at a time, then we wouldn't see each other in person for sometimes up to six months. Those three years were extremely toxic and to be honest I'm not sure if it ever stopped being toxic or if along the way my spirit broke. When we started getting more serious, he had told his ex-wife that he had separated, that they needed to just pull the plug and get divorced, they had both already moved on, and she had even moved in her new boyfriend. (I know this seems irrelevant but I promise it's not.) 

I have never been close with much of my family outside of my parents but that's a story for a different day lol. Anyway, toward the end of those three years we were long distance, my dad had gotten really sick and passed away. My dad was my best friend in the entire world, it's been four years since his passing, and I still struggle with that loss every day. That was the same year I packed up and moved the other side of the country to be with my boyfriend. I try not to think about my dad because I still haven't forgiven my boyfriend and I don't think I ever will for what he did at the end of my dad's life. If I hadn't been so overwhelmed with grief at the time, and thought about it then, I don't think I would have moved or continued a relationship with him. He and my dad got along really well, like my dad was not a people person in the slightest, he hated everyone but loved my boyfriend. So much so that my boyfriend would call my dad and they would just chat, they spent time with each other outside of work, and without me, they became friends. I didn't work the entire time he was in the hospital, and every morning I would walk into his hospital room, and every single day he would say the exact same thing, ""There's the sunshine of my life, how is \_\_\_\_"" He would ask about my boyfriend every single day. Again, at the point we were still long distance, but one night he was working in the area and came by to see me. It was late, almost 11 pm, when we drove past the hospital my dad was in. I told him my dad wanted to see him, and he said no, that it was too late, and he didn't want to wake him up I told him he was awake, that he doesn't get to sleep much because he was always receiving some kind of transfusion and he told me he would see him next time i dropped it because I knew just as well as he knew there wouldn't be a next time so I just dropped him back off at his vehicle. Like I said later that year, I packed up and moved across the country that's when shit really hit the fan. He and his ex-wife had a long, nasty, drawn-out divorce. If you told me his ex was the antichrist I would believe you. When she found out I had moved here, she lost it. She took me to court because she didn't want me to date him. They have five children together, and one of his younger kids had his old phone to play games on, and she took it, got into his iCloud, and posted nudes of me everywhere, she found my mom's Facebook page and through that my aunts and uncles and started sending them the photos of me. She also decided that she wasn't going to let him see his kids anymore, which just dragged out the entire divorce even more, and my boyfriend has this awful habit of not listening to anyone. He would ask me for advice and his attorney for advice and we would both tell him the same thing but when he didn't listen to it he would get pissed and tell me that him not being able to see his kids and his life falling apart is all my fault. He's said that more times than I can count. The last time he said it I told him if he ever said that again I was done and was leaving him. Once their divorce finally ended, they were civil with each other and everything was great. I was a big part of his kids' lives and I love them so much, they're great kids. After I moved, it left my mom alone back in my hometown, and she sold her house and moved here. 

Then his ex and her boyfriend go into it, and she was trying to get back together with my boyfriend, and when he said no, she started everything up again, not letting him see his kids, etc. This has been going on for the last year, and he has given up on trying to talk to her, so going back to court starts in a couple of days, and I don't know if I can handle it again. If we were in a better place in our relationship, I don't think it would bother me so much. I love my boyfriend and I know he loves me, but I think over the past year we have both fallen out of love with each other. He is impossible to talk to, he's always right, and no matter what, he finds a way to make every issue my fault. I'm not saying I'm innocent, I'm saying it takes two to tango. I wanted to take care of him and I started spoiling him, going out of my way to do things for him and I have created a monster who now does nothing for himself. Our job isn't typical in the slightest, our boss signs every check in a checkbook and gives it to us to write our own checks and I could be in the middle of something and he will have me stop what i'm doing to write out our paychecks even when they're right in front of him. Example, last night I was sitting on the couch reading a book, and he had me stop and come up stairs to our bedroom and find the TV remote for him. It was on the nightstand where it always is. The other day I got so mad I had to leave the house to avoid a fight. He was going to the gas station and we were out of sugar i knew i wouldn't have enough for another cup of coffee so i asked him if while he was at the gas station if he could pick up a box of sugar and he asked me if i really needed it or if it could wait. As much as I want to care for him, it just feels so one-sided. Like I said before, I'm the kind of person who can find the silver lining in any situation, but he is the kind of person who will find something to complain about.  Again, just last night, one of our neighbors had a limo come pick them up and he was calling the limo driver stupid for pulling in their driveway because he was struggling to back out and people were honking at him. Were we going anywhere? No. Did it have any effect on us? Again no. He just watched out the window complaining. His main complaint is our sex life. It sucks and barely exists. I hate to admit it but I don't want to have sex with him. The sex itself feels fine but I never finish, ever. I haven't had an orgasm in eight years. He'll ask every now and then if I finished and I lie and say I did because I don't want to talk about it with him. He doesn't last very long but that's not the worst part. I have told him so many times that I don't want to have sex with him because it just feels so cold and emotionless. I have told him so many times that I'd like him to kiss me or something at least, and I get that every now and then when it's been a while since we had sex, but not often. There is absolutely no foreplay at all. This is how sex goes with him, I walk in the room and he tells me to get naked and I go grab a towel, come back get naked, and spit on my hand so I can put it on myself because again no foreplay so I'm bone dry he then sticks it in and two minutes later it's done. I just go through the motions of it because I know it won't last long and it's better than dealing with his attitude. 

 I find being around him just so exhausting now. I feel my mood lift when he leaves the house. I know I just spent all this time complaining about him but I really do love him. When he's happy and in a great mood, it's like I'm on cloud nine being around him he's kind anf hilarious and I find myself wanting time to stand still It just sucks that those moments are far and few between. I don't know what to do because I do love him, and when it's good, it's great, but I also feel like I shouldn't limit my life's happiness to whenever he chooses to be in a good mood. I also know that if I choose to leave him it's going to be the hardest thing I have ever done. We're not married, but we have a joint bank account, both of our names are on the mortgage of the house we're buying, we have a dog that I love, but I know I couldn't take from him,  It hasn't even been a year since my mom moved here, I love his kids, I also don't know how he would figure out life if I left. I'd bet my left leg he doesn't even know what website to go to to pay our mortgage or the utilities. I also know he does love me, I know my leaving would destroy him. I know with the upcoming court dates with his ex it's going to put a strain on our relationship and we're going to start fighting again like we did the last time. Now I'm trying to figure out if, when that does come, and it will if I fight to save this or walk away. The thought of not being with him breaks my heart. I love him so much, but all of these things I've complained about aren't things I haven't tried talking about with him. I'm also nervous that I'm just going through another one of those times where I want a change and I will end up regretting it if I choose to leave.

1j16bm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1j16bm9/3_parks_in_1_day/,3 Parks in 1 Day,"Thought I‚Äôd give a report on our three parks in one day (MK, Epcot, HS). When I was researching a trip like this, most of the advice was against it, saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do it all,‚Äù which I‚Äôm sure is true, but we weren‚Äôt trying to do it all. We had about 3 priorities in each park and we were able to do everything we wanted and more. 

The disclaimers: we are married in our 20s with no kids. Neither of us have been to Disney World since we were kids and we just wanted a quick and fun trip. We are relatively fit and had realistic expectations that this would be a long day. Ultimately everything went about as perfect as it could have, thanks to Standby Skipper (can‚Äôt recommend enough) and a bit of luck - no ride closures that impacted us. All rides were either LLMP or LLSP with the exception of Pirates (walk on at 9am) and Tiana‚Äôs (30 minute standby line at about 9:30am). We went on Thursday 2/27. 

*Magic Kingdom*
We arrived a little before 9am on the monorail. We stayed off property but our hotel had a shuttle to the TTC. 
Rides: Pirates, Tiana‚Äôs, Little Mermaid (used this as a LL burner), Haunted Mansion.
(Yes, we skipped Tomorrowland all together)
Food: cr√®me br√ªl√©e croissant, cheeseburger spring rolls, dole whip.
Experiences: got held up by the Festival of Fantasy on our way out, but it was fun to watch. 

*Epcot*
Took the monorail, arrived a little after 1pm. 
Rides: Guardians and Remy‚Äôs.
Food: tacos, empanadas, and avocado margarita in Mexico; Viking coffee in Norway; Ottawa apple and beer in Canada. Decided to wait to get dinner in HS. 
Experiences: Moana Journey of Water (could have done without this TBH) and walking the World Showcase visiting each pavilion.

*Hollywood Studios*
Took the skyliner, arrived about 6pm. 
Rides: Mickey and Minnie‚Äôs Runaway Railway, Tower of Terror, Slinky Dog Dash, Rise of the Resistance.
Food: totchos and BBQ brisket melt from Woody‚Äôs Lunchbox, cold brew black caf in Galaxy‚Äôs Edge, Jack Jack‚Äôs cookie.
Experiences: really enjoyed the theming and atmosphere of Toy Story land at night. We skipped Fantasmic as we were tired and satisfied with our day, but it could have fit into this itinerary. 

We left HS at about 8:45pm, so it was a full 12 hour park day, clocking out at 30,000 steps. 

All this to say, you can do it if you want to and if you have realistic expectations and know your priorities. To be honest, the only park we could see ourselves having a full day in by itself would be Epcot to really stretch it out and try food/drinks in every country. 

Another shoutout to Standby Skipper, because we probably couldn‚Äôt have accomplished a day this full without it. I had done so much research on the LLMP system and thought I didn‚Äôt need a third party to help me because I understood how it works. But the real benefit was saving time and stress of being on my phone all day trying to get the rides and times we wanted. Best $25 we spent of the trip.

The problem with these shows is that they were turning very serious topics into comedy. Make fun of Trump struggling to drink water, or misspell coffee, or throwing a temper tantrum at Taylor Swift? Great, those are good comedy materials. **But making fun of abortion rights, War in Ukraine, Trump threatening Canada? That's actively hurting the liberal agenda! Those should be reported only in a serious light.** 

Right now, Trump seems to be able to get away with every idiotic/evil thing he does. Every time the liberals point those out, it becomes a ""boy cried wolf"" situation. Trump can roll around in mud and no mud would be sticking because people would just associate the mud with ""the left is making fun of Trump again"".

Just left Royalton Negril. Saw lots of mixed reviews so I‚Äôll give you mine if it helps! Not sure if I have even written a review üôÇ

TLDR: amazing amazing staff, stunning beach, good food, rooms were decent but need work for the price (5001 Swim up presidential was nice but butlers had to help fix a number of the doors) spent one night in the penthouse in building one which absolutely should not even be used until it is renovated completely. IF YOU BOOKED PENTHOUSE CHANGE IT. Would come back but would work through a travel agent since so many people paid 1/3 of the cost we did using one. If we had paid less I‚Äôd been less picky about the rooms. Staff makes up for the lacking rooms. 

STAFF: The staff makes the entire experience. They were wonderful. We had Diamond Club with Damon and Oshain. My kids did kids club and loved the women there. They miss them. I can‚Äôt say enough about all of the staff. Tip them well, they deserve it.

PROPERTY: The exterior property is so well taken care of. They are constantly cleaning, taking care of the trees and plants, the pools (including the swim-ups) are constantly cleaned. Pristine is a word I would use.

BEACH: The beach is the most beautiful I have seen. Worth it to make the trip to Negril. I‚Äôd go back just for the beach. Sooo calm.

DIAMOND CLUB: I think it‚Äôs worth it. Our butlers were amazing. Very helpful. We had some issues with our room 5001 (I‚Äôll get to that later) and they were very prompt in getting maintenance in to fix the issues. The diamond club pool is nice but far from building 5 so we didn‚Äôt use it too much. You can get breakfast service at the Italian place instead of the buffet which was really nice. We just drink beer and wine so can‚Äôt speak for the liquor. 

ROOMS: Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky. We had room 5001 in building 5 for 7 days. I think it might be the nicest building that we saw. I would recommend it. Plus, that room is on the end so more privacy. There‚Äôs no sunlight that hits the swim up pool and the pools are not heated, in case that matters to you. We liked it because it faced the ocean and my kids don‚Äôt care how cold the water is ‚Äî they‚Äôll swim! Quiet but also so convenient for food and activities.

The main issue is we decided to stay one more night before going to Jewel Grande in Montego Bay. They originally said our 5001 room was available for an extra night but it turned out it wasn‚Äôt. Simple mistake, no biggie. So we had to change rooms. We decided to splurge and do one night in the PENTHOUSE suite. It was in building 1. Huge HUGE mistake. I‚Äôm embarrassed by the amount of we spent and the room was in total disrepair. The elevators in the building do not work. The huge glass wall behind the kitchen was cracked straight down the middle. The doors were all broken. The inside tub is so strange you can‚Äôt fit it in. You sort of have to sit? But like your body doesn‚Äôt really go in it? I don‚Äôt know how to explain. The curtains won‚Äôt close. We had to pull them together and then push a chair against them to block the sun. The outdoor hot tub is huge and the space out there could be great but the wood needs to be replaced and the hot tub is at such an angle the water on the left is down about a foot and when you get in the water pours out the right side. The dining room table is so unsturdy that when we put breakfast down on it it fell to the side and two glasses fell off and broke. We tried to fix it ourselves but ended up eating at the little coffee table. This room could be so epic with the size inside, the deck, the size of the hot tub, and the privacy of the deck. It should not be rented at all right now. A best western/red roof inn would be 100x nicer. 
FULL DISCLOSURE: we were so crunched on time by the time we got in there we had to set the kids up for bed. We did not tell our butlers who would have done what they could to help. On the way out we were so late for our shuttle that I didn‚Äôt talk to the staff about the issues. But in reality it just needs a gut job. I‚Äôm going to try not to weep when I remember how much we paid for that and I doubt there is recourse. Just do NOT book this room. Once it‚Äôs renovated it would be so cool.

FOOD: first all inclusive. The buffet was great. Huge. We ate at the steak house, the Italian place, hibachi, and the sushi restaurant. All were good. The hibachi unfortunately did not have working hood fans. I did eventually have to walk outside and I saw a few other people doing the same. The smoke inside was intense. Overall, good food! Great coffee.

KIDS CLUB: we weren‚Äôt planning to use it. I was just nervous in another country. But my 6 year old wanted to check it out. He ended up doing a few hours each day and we paid a nanny ($20 an hour) to stay there with our 2 year old also so he could participate. The women were awesome. Each day we were there the building lost power in the afternoon and it closed. I did read other reviews on that so try for the mornings!

Hope this helps!!

For a project at school I need to conduct a community survey to determine what types of coffee people drink, what activities are typically associated to drinking coffee and just get a general idea of the demographic of people drinking coffee or even other types of beverages.

Its pretty quick to fill out and it would help out a lot with completing my project. So if you have the time (less than 2 minutes) please quickly check off some items:

Join the **Anti Social Book Club**‚Äîa new NYC social + book club for people who love literature and hope to create new connections along the way. 

We‚Äôll kick off with a light read, **Breakfast at Tiffany‚Äôs**, a stylish yet bittersweet novella about self-invention, loneliness, and the search for belonging in New York City‚Äîperfect for a book club based in the city and that thrives on irony in it‚Äôs name. Here‚Äôs the general format: 

The **book club** will typically meet **the second to last week of a month, on a weeknight,** to dive into the month‚Äôs read over drinks, coffee, or whatever suits the setting. For our first book discussion we will be going to *Bookclub Bar on Thursday, March 20 at 6:30pm* in order to discuss our reading, meet some new people, and to figure out Aprils social plans and book selection. 

The **social club** meets on the **second weekend** of each month for a casual outing‚Äîthink picnics in the park, museums, bar and foodie crawls, or enjoying the performing arts. It‚Äôs a laid-back way to meet new people and ease into things, no reading necessary. *stay tuned for next weeks social outing!*

Comment / DM if interested and I can send the Bookclubs link for RSVP and updates. Will likely make a WhatsApp group chat, but prefer people attend at least one event before being able to join, as an added safety measure to protect its members. ",6,1740853615.0,nycmeetups,10,0.87,False
1j164nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Original_Poetry/comments/1j164nb/she_said_shes_okay/,She said she's okay,"She said she's okay and gone on about her day. She stirs the sugar into her coffee cup because it's the little bit of sweet she needs to add to the bitterness of what life has become. Small side smiles hide the awkward conversations and the fact that she's not sure what normal will ever be. Trying not to let loves hollow disappointment consume her life, she tries to fill her day with mindless tasks so she doesn't sit and feel sorry for herself for too long. She's got hollers and hills in her blood. Her eyes are smoky blue like the mountains her family settled in. She's got a fire burning in her, it's slowing burning on a warm summer night, while cicadas sing a lullaby and the crickets sing along too. Lord knows she can handle the weight of a mountain but she's tested to climb it. Holding the weight of a mountain can be foolish. You ought to climb to the top and take in the view. She has been up and down that mountain. Taking detours, getting stuck in the mud, drenched in rain, hell she even thought about digging a hole and just climbing in it. But she didn't. She kept stirring that sugar in her coffee every morning and filling her day with mindless tasks. Some people say she's still working her way up that mountain.

1j16240,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j16240/aitah_for_feeling_empty_since_my_fianc√©e_left_me/,AITAH for feeling empty since my fianc√©e left me?,"Today marks exactly four weeks since the person who was my fianc√©e left me... The situation was as follows: Before meeting her, my life was in a really bad place. I had accumulated about $6,000 in debt, I had quit my job due to issues with my boss (I worked in a restaurant), and although I found a ""better"" restaurant job, the pay was very low. The long commute, rotating shifts, and my unstable mental state only led me to sink deeper into misery. I was never one to go out partying or drink alcohol, but during that time, I started going out and getting drunk‚Äîto the point where one night, a taxi driver left me stranded halfway home, and I had to walk back in a deplorable state. After that, I realized how bad my situation was.

Ironically, just a few weeks later, I met her‚Äîon October 11, 2023. She was a customer at the restaurant, haha, a funny coincidence. She came back two days later and asked for my number. To me, it felt like seeing an angel. I experienced beautiful moments with her... though for most of our relationship, I behaved like a child. I quit my job, and she supported me, but I hadn‚Äôt yet told her about my debt. When I finally did, I fell into a state of absolute panic... I felt like I was going to lose everything again because of my past mistakes. Even so, she accepted me. She didn‚Äôt struggle financially‚Äîher family had worked hard and built what, in my eyes, was a paradise. I always felt like a fly buzzing around them... My mistakes, my actions... everything made me feel even more at risk of losing it all.

I lied a lot to her family‚Äînever to her, but to her family, lying became a daily habit... especially to her mother. I was always afraid of her. She wasn‚Äôt just someone who spoke her mind‚Äîshe was also incredibly knowledgeable, strategic, and powerful. She always scared me, and even more so when, in a conversation, she told me that I was ""brilliant."" When she said that, I nearly broke down. I thought to myself, *Me? Brilliant? Drowning in debt and lying to your face out of shame for my pathetic life? That‚Äôs brilliance?*

Months passed, and while some things improved, others didn‚Äôt. I had an ex (she was around 19 at the time) who got pregnant, and we decided to have an abortion. It was a horrible experience for me, and the guilt stayed with me. Then, as if it were karma‚Äîor maybe just my inability to face the past‚Äîit happened again. She, the woman I thought I‚Äôd spend my life with, got pregnant, and once again, I found myself involved in an abortion.

I wanted to support her no matter what‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want her to go through it alone. But she already had everything figured out. I had nothing to give. I didn‚Äôt even know how to turn on a heater when she was going through that awful process. I don‚Äôt know where my mind was that night when I tried to have sex with her‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know what I was thinking or why... but I knew I had messed up. In fact, I would have understood if she had left me right then and there. I was useless when she needed me the most. But she didn‚Äôt leave‚Äîshe just asked for a break.

Forty days, exactly. A full quarantine. It was devastating. But I had another chance. I investigated what was wrong with me, reasoned through it, and worked on myself day by day. I wrote every single day‚Äîwhat I was thinking, what I did, what I realized about myself, etc. When we got back together, I gave her that notebook. I just wanted her to read it. I knew my words could be twisted with lies, but if anything in that notebook was true, maybe it would mean something. And with that, we truly got back together.

Months later, on Saturday, October 12, 2024, I proposed to her. She was everything a woman should be. We were about to start building our house, I had gotten a job‚Äînot a great one, but enough to start paying off my debts. Things were improving. We were doing activities together, my relationship with her parents was getting better. Everything was fine... until November of that same year.

Because of my debts, I didn‚Äôt have much money saved for transportation and things like that, so I rode my bike to work. One day, there was an event her mother organized, and I had forgotten about it. My plan was just to go, show up, and admit, ""I forgot."" My mind was all over the place at that time‚Äîwork was overwhelming, my boss was unbearable, and I wasn‚Äôt on good terms with my parents, so I couldn‚Äôt even borrow their car to go to my in-laws‚Äô place. I hadn‚Äôt been paid yet, and I had very little money left for transportation. Eight hours before the event, I decided to cancel on her mother. Understandably, she was furious‚Äîand so was my fianc√©e. I knew immediately that canceling was another mistake. I knew there were people who could have given me a ride home if I had just gone... but instead, I decided to stir up the hornet‚Äôs nest.

Sometime later, her mother told me, in so many words, that she saw me as nothing more than a constant conflict and an exercise in patience that life had placed before her. I know she didn‚Äôt insult me directly, but those words still echo in my head... *Had I really improved? Had I truly grown?*

In January, I got fired. In a way, I was relieved‚ÄîI no longer had to endure that boss. Plus, I received more money than if I had quit, which helped me keep my debts under control for a few months. That same day, I told my father, and he said he would talk to his boss to see if I could work with him (my father is a supervisor in the plumbing industry). For some reason, I was convinced that I would start as an ""Official"" (a mid-level position). I don‚Äôt know why‚Äîif I misheard, if I dreamed it, if I made it up‚Äîbut that‚Äôs what I told everyone, including her parents. I also lied to them about getting fired, telling them I had quit. They found out the truth, and my fianc√©e was upset that I had lied to them.

But the real breaking point was when they asked my father what position I would have. He said ""Laborer"" (the lowest-ranking job, though still well-paid). Her parents told her, and, well... she left me.

That day, she pretended it was a normal date. We had coffee, spent the afternoon together, and later, we were supposed to attend a meeting about the house we were building. I was working on a job simulation at the time, and my head was elsewhere. I knew my situation with her wasn‚Äôt great, but the project was due in a week, and I thought I could postpone dealing with everything for just one more week. But that Saturday... she left me. My whole world collapsed.

Later, I found out she had asked for advice on Reddit. A lot of the things people said were true. But one thing hurt more than anything else: *""I don‚Äôt want him to be the father of my children.""* That was a kick in the gut.

I thought seriously about suicide. Ironically, I found a job where I work at considerable heights with only a few safety planks between me and the void. Every day, I look down and ask myself, *Why not? It would be quick.*

But I don‚Äôt do it. I go to the gym every day now. I work 10 hours with just one break. I earn way more than before... but it‚Äôs only February. Time moves so much slower now. It‚Äôs ironic‚ÄîI dream about her every night.

A few days ago, I attended a house meeting alone... and there was a couple there. They were the reflection of what she and I used to be. When I saw them, I couldn‚Äôt hold it in. I broke down crying and left.

Now, I‚Äôm torn‚Äîshould I keep the house or leave it behind? I know having a house in my name is valuable at my age, but I can‚Äôt look at that land without seeing every moment we shared...

What do I do now with my life? What goal can I have if I‚Äôm nothing but the trash people say I am?",2,1740853419.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

For pour over, it recommends 8-9 on its scale (I'm usually around 7 there) and for espresso it recommends 3.5 to 4.5.... 

I figured for the espresso I'd start at the lower end, and I ended up getting a 6oz cup of coffee out of it. Down to 3.0.... 2.5.... 2.0.... 1.5 and I still need to go further down. At this point I'm mad at myself for trusting the guide sheet instead of buying a cheap bag of beans to dial in closer so I didn't end up wasting 100+g of my good beans. Is there potentially an issue with my grinder? Do I need to recalibrate? Or have others have the same issue and the guidelines from 1Zpresso are just lies.

I'm just looking for both reassurance but also others experiences. (I'm basing how far along I am based off of ovulation, not LMP. It's possible I'm more like 8 weeks today. My dating US is in 2 days)

I've had debilitating nausea from 5w2d until 7w1d. It was very overwhelming and I started taking diclectin. It barely helped and they put me on metoclopramide for severe days. Then suddenly on 7wd2 and d3, my nausea has been notably milder. I could drink coffee today for the first time in weeks. I'm still not 100% - extreme food aversions, increased salivating, and low/altered appetite are still persisting. But I'm just not expediting the debilitating, barely-surviving nausea that I was experiencing the last two weeks.

I have no cramping, spotting or anything. My breasts still hurt and are sensitive. 

Am I possibly out of the woods for the debilitating nausea? All of the comments on the posts I have read say their nausea let up around 10-14 weeks. I'm not finding a lot that say it improved around 8 weeks. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough. 

I've read a few posts that the nausea came and went for some people, but for those who had severe nausea, did it ever randomly ease up for a few days and come back? Does the placenta start to take over quite this early? ",1,1740853397.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False
1j161js,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j161js/i_dont_know_to_feel_about_my_marriage/,I don‚Äôt know to feel about my marriage,"Hi everyone. This is my first post here and very new to Reddit. Decided to do this because I needed an outlet to share (or rant) this. I guess I‚Äôm not the only with these problems but I just can‚Äôt keep this to myself anymore. 

I‚Äôm tired, annoyed, frustrated with my husband behaviour lately. It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs not a good father (which I feel is also slowly going downhill) but it seems like he‚Äôs becoming a terrible husband day by day. He‚Äôs getting a tad selfish and only thinking of himself. 

With 2 kids under 3, and after 6 years of marriage, you‚Äôd think he should get routines down pat. Unfortunately not. If not for me pestering and reminding him to move along, he will take forever to get ready in the mornings. Otherwise, we probably won‚Äôt leave on time for anything. 

I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I‚Äôm the only one running the household. I‚Äôm the one keep stock of groceries and toiletries and stuff for the kids. I‚Äôm the one calling to arrange appointments and making sure dinner is ordered for the kids. He didn‚Äôt even bother chipping in for any of what I‚Äôve mentioned. He does laundry only when he realises he doesn‚Äôt have enough of certain clothing. He couldn‚Äôt spare energy to do household after coming home from work and this after I‚Äôve done what I can between looking after our child and working from home. So much so that I‚Äôve given up and gotten a helper which I asked him to pay but he said it should be halved between us. 

He takes forever to do the stuff I need help with. Multiple reminders, said nicely to him. He will say I nag, I‚Äôm too impatient. When I asked him to do stuff that could speed things when going out with the kids, to do things that are more important, he becomes defensive and comes up with lots of excuses and it becomes an argument. 

I end up packing for kids. He does the bare minimum and will wait for me to tell him to do more. I end up rushing everyone and he will say I rush for no reason. 

When I share these feelings and worries with him, I just wished he listens to me instead of saying he‚Äôs just as tired, he contributes just as much, that I‚Äôm overthinking things, and I should tell him if I needed help because he can‚Äôt read my mind. It seems so futile when I try to commit my feelings with him and ask him for help because it ends up being a huge disappointment. He‚Äôs just so lazy lately and it‚Äôs like he could die or break apart if he didn‚Äôt get rest/nap or coffee or time to himself, which he has had all 3 whenever he wants them. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about divorce lately. But I don‚Äôt want to break the family up and let my kids be in broken homes and away from me during shared custody. At the same time, if I don‚Äôt feel supported in any way in the marriage and me doing things for the family goes unappreciated, why even bother to stay? He doesn‚Äôt even say sorry. He doesn‚Äôt even care when I breakdown and cry because he just assumes I overreacted to something or nothing at all. 

Also, during some of the big arguments we had, I felt so damn useless and lost and like as if I‚Äôm more of a burden than help. The things he says to me hurt me so much - that I overreact and that I‚Äôm downplaying his efforts, that I‚Äôm making myself sound too important than I really am, things would be fine if I stopped being so controlling and worried. When he says these things, leaving everything behind has definitely crossed my mind many times but I can‚Äôt imagine leaving my kids behind and letting them live their lives without a mother. 

I‚Äôm not sure what I want or need from Reddit. For those who read this thru till the end, thank you so much and even if you have nothing to say, it just feels good to put these all down.

I don't know if this is depression because it's a very angry feeling. Like I just can't work around the fact of what an abomination I am. I don't deserve to even breathe. And I don't know how to become not an abomination. It's so awful. Yesterday I could not go to a job interview. I'm going to completely lose all hope or sense of stability in my life I guess but also that makes sense and is how it should go because I'm such a horrible person etc. I just want to stop existing. I feel so guilty for having existed at all and for getting a job interview and thinking I could ever be a real person.

I was banned from the depression subreddit so I'm posting here. 

Thank you for listening.

Have you experienced this? Do you know the word for what it is called? It is much stronger than anything I read about in the books. And I really don't know how to fight it down.

In the middle of the night I can do some things. During the day I just drink coffee to keep myself from weeping the whole time. I don't feel depressed I just need a solution or at least a search term to help ",7,1740853025.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

So, today at the hotel has been... *interesting*. It started off normal enough, but then the universe decided to test us. First, the coffee machine in the lobby decided it was done with its job and started making sounds like a dying walrus. Guests were staring at it like it was about to transform into a robot and take over the hotel. We had to promise free pastries to anyone who didn‚Äôt complain about the lack of caffeine.

Then, the elevator decided to join in on the chaos. It got stuck between floors for a solid 10 minutes with a guest inside who was *convinced* it was the start of a horror movie. He started narrating his own dramatic escape plan over the intercom, complete with sound effects. When we finally got him out, he bowed like he‚Äôd just won an Oscar. We gave him a free drink at the bar for his performance.

Oh, and speaking of the bar‚Äîapparently, we‚Äôre now a wildlife sanctuary. A bird flew in through an open window and decided to perch above the liquor shelf. It just sat there, judging everyone‚Äôs drink choices. We tried to shoo it out, but it clearly thought it was the new bartender. We‚Äôre calling it ‚ÄúTipsy the Mixologist‚Äù now.

And then, just when we thought things couldn‚Äôt get weirder, a guest called down to the front desk to report that their shower was ‚Äúhaunted.‚Äù Turns out, the water pressure was so strong it made the shower curtain flap around like a ghost. They insisted on switching rooms, so we moved them... only for them to call back and say the new room‚Äôs TV remote was ‚Äúpossessed‚Äù because it kept changing channels on its own. (Spoiler: It was just low battery.)

All in all, it‚Äôs been one of those days where we‚Äôre just trying to keep a straight face and remind ourselves that at least it‚Äôs not boring. Hope you‚Äôre enjoying your day off‚Äîbecause the hotel clearly decided to throw a party in your absence!",68,1740852911.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,14,0.98,False

My jobs: pack lunches, work full time, help kids with homework, cook dinner or take out, grocery shopping online and pick up, pay bills and discipline kids most of the time.  They don't listen, I'm called in.  Kids want something, he looks at me for an answer.
His jobs: get kids ready, drop us off, bring me coffee when picking us up, clean and vacuum, give kids baths, brush their teeth, takes out the garbage and makes dinner maybe once a week.
We both take turns putting them to sleep.

Then when I sit down to read for a bit before going to bed, he wants to talk about things and I am exhausted and don't like drama of who said what.

Should I just take it?,"I made then deleted a post but basically, my job of over a year as a medical assistant/caregiver at a dementia facility has been treating me poorly lately. I basically got ganged up on and received a ""final write up"" over absences that lined with what I should do in their sick policy and was told I cannot miss anymore days or I'm fired. It made 0 sense because it felt like they were telling me if I come in sick, it's against policy, but if I miss days due to being sick, I'm fired.

For the record I was out with pneumonia for 3 days, and before that, norovirus stemming from my facility, and they asked us to stay home for infectious illness as our patients are immunocompromised.

I spoke to my manager yesterday to try to understand what's going on and it amounted to a BUNCH of miscommunication, catty nurses, and general empty threats. But still, my passion for the job broke so fast. I work 60+ hours a week and it was a slap in the face to be treated as if I never am there - I had tried to quit in November due to similar but different dissatisfactions, but my supervisor stopped me, took me out for a coffee, feigned caring, gave me a 50 cent raise, etc. I caved and stay because I love my patients.


Last night though I finally started casually job hunting. I found one particular caregiving position that pays 2 dollars more an hour, where we don't work ***underneath*** nurses and focus more on assisted living. It honestly sounds like a great job. I called this AM and after a quick interview, I was invited to new employee orientation Thursday March 6th.


Should I just risk it for this new job? Almost 2 dollars more an hour, more aligned with my own beliefs, no hierarchy of head nurses to QMAPs to caregivers, just assisted living.


ETA - my current facility has high turnover, it was a great job at first but it's become a nightmare in so many ways. It hired me as fast as this new one would like to.

.I do need to be employed, I'm still looking at other places but the simple thought of going into my current job right now just guts me.

She came across pretty angry and unhappy to be there (which, I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt) to me. At times she seemed to be nearly seething from my point of view.

I gather she thought Ezra was a teen drama queen and she seems to paint Jason as a doofus, which I can certainly get that. She gets drawn into this whole thing (or perhaps better to say she allowed herself to be drawn into it) and takes on a bit of a mediator role (telling Jason he‚Äôs insensitive in how he berates Ezra, for instance him saying her makeup made her look like a clown; and Ezra for breaking up by text).

I get it. She just wants to be with her BF, who lives with Jason, and every time she goes over to the apartment or the coffee shop there‚Äôs this whole De Grassi Junior High drama around everything (as seems to be the case wherever Ezra goes) and she‚Äôs fed up with it.

I take her testimony as ‚Äòwhy the fuck do I have to be here, I am so over this whole thing, finish your questions so I can get the fuck out of here‚Äô but wondering if someone got a different vibe ‚Äî angry at Ezra for killing Alex, angry at Jason for bringing this person, indirectly, into her life, etc.",2,1740852683.0,ezramccandless,0,1.0,False
