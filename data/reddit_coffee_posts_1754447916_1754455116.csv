  BLYTHE  
  
  I was as ugly inside as I was outside. It was the only explanation for the fact I hadn’t been able to cry one single tear. I hadn’t even squeezed out one fake tear at Mrs. Williams’s funeral. I knew the church people thought I was evil. I could see it when they looked at me. But they had all gotten to witness it firsthand when they’d watched me not show one small streak of emotion when I’d stood beside Pastor Williams as they’d lowered his wife into the ground. She had been diagnosed with a brain tumor only five months ago. It had been stage five, and there had been nothing they could have done.  
  
  The congregation had stopped by to check on her daily, and the parsonage had been flooded with casseroles, pies, and flowers. I ha  
d been told to stay out of sight. I’d only upset her. Pastor Williams had been kind when he’d instructed me to keep to my room when I’d come home from school, but it’d still stung. I’d waited until I was sure they were asleep most nights to sneak downstairs and fix me something to eat for dinner. The endless supply of food had made it easy.  
  
  When she had finally taken her last breath, the hospice nurse had come and knocked on my door to inform me. I had been asked to call Pastor Williams at the church and have him come home. I hadn’t felt anything. Not one emotion from the news. I’d realized then that she had been right all those years. I was evil. Only someone truly evil could be so indifferent to death. Mrs. Williams had been only fifty-four. But then, that was much older than my mother had been when she’d died—she had been only twenty.  
  
  That was all behind me now. That life was over and in my past.  
  
  I stood outside the apartment building that overlooked the Alabama gulf coast and let it sink in that this was now my home. I was far away from the life I’d lived in South Carolina. I would have a new life here. One where I could sit and write my stories and attend the community college.  
  
  Pastor Williams had wanted to get rid of me. I was thankful for that because I needed a way to get free from that place. He had called a friend of his and had gotten me into a community college ten hours away from the town full of people who hated me. He had bought me an apartment on the beach and even managed to get me a job working as a church secretary. He had a friend who pastored a church in Sea Breeze, Alabama. It was one of the reasons he had sent me here. He had had someone help set me up while he remained in South Carolina.  
  
  I had heard Pastor Williams on the phone explaining to the man who would be my boss that I wasn’t good with people and I was sheltered. Which wasn’t exactly true. I had gone to an all-girl Christian academy, and everyone there had pretended that I hadn’t existed. It wasn’t my fault their mommas had told them about the evil inside me. I had never had a chance to actually be around people who wanted anything to do with me.  
  
  Before I took my boxes out of the truck, I wanted to check out the apartment. Pastor Williams had given me a truck, too. Grabbing my purse and the keys he had placed in an envelope, along with one thousand dollars in cash, I jumped down out of the old truck and headed for the stairs. None of the apartments were on the street level. They were all on stilts above the ground. I figured this was for times when the water got high . . . or during hurricanes. I wasn’t going to think about hurricanes. Not now.  
  
  I slipped the key into the lock and turned before pushing the door open. It swung wide, and I took in the pretty pale yellow walls and white wicker furniture. It was all very coastal. I loved it.  
  
  Smiling, I walked inside and spun around in a circle with my arms opened wide. I tilted my head back and closed my eyes and let myself bask in the solitude. No one knew me here. I wasn’t the evil girl who the pastor was stuck taking care of. I was just me. Blythe Blakely. And I was a writer. A recluse eccentric writer who didn’t care what she looked like. It didn’t matter. She was free.  
  
  Loud male voices laughing and throwing insults in the hallway interrupted my quiet moment of joy. I dropped my arms to turn and lock gazes with . . . with . . . a guy. Blue. Like the sky on a clear sunny day. That was all I could focus on. I had never seen eyes so blue. They were so startling, they were almost breathtaking. His friends’ voices were fading away, but he was still standing there. Then I noticed it. . . . Was he wearing black eyeliner? I dropped my eyes to take in the rest of him.  
  
  The pierced eyebrow and colorful tattooed skin I saw covering his arms had me jerking my gaze back up to his face. Seemingly windblown platinum-blond hair finished the wild look.  
  
  “You done, love? Or is it my turn?” The teasing lilt to his low husky voice reminded me of warm chocolate. It made me feel almost giddy.  
  
  Not sure what he was talking about, I looked back at his amused eyes. “I, uh . . .” I what? I didn’t know what to say. “I don’t know what you mean,” I finally told him honestly. Should I apologize for staring at him? Had I been?  
  
  “Are you done checking me out? Because I’d hate to interrupt you.”  
  
  Oh. My face heated, and I knew my cheeks were bright red. What was I thinking, leaving my door open for the world to see me? I wasn’t used to this. Keeping my distance from men in general made me extremely inept at talking to one. However, this one didn’t stare at me with that leer that made me nervous. I was used to the look men gave me because they thought I would do bad things with them. The ugly they saw didn’t seem to deter them from wanting to see if I was as evil as they had heard.  
  
  “It’s just some tattoos and a couple piercings, love. I promise I’m harmless,” he said this time with a smile on his face.  
  
  I managed to nod. I should say something. I just wasn’t sure what to say. He was waiting on me to speak. “I like them,” I blurted out nervously. That sounded stupid. He raised an eyebrow, and a smirk touched his lips. “The tattoos—they’re nice. Colorful. Uh . . . I . . .” I sounded like an idiot. There was no saving myself from this disaster. Closing my eyes so I didn’t have to see those blue eyes watching me, I took a deep breath. “I’m not good at talking to people—guys, people, anyone really.” Had I really just told him that?  
  
  If he would just turn and leave, then we could forget this moment forever. I forced my eyes open and caught him studying me with that grin still on his lips. He was going to think I was nuts. Maybe he was visiting someone here and didn’t live in this complex. I really didn’t want to face him again. Ever.  
  
  He pressed the pad of his thumb to his bottom lip and bit the tip of it before chuckling and shaking his head. “Not sure I’ve met anyone quite like you,” he said before letting his hand fall back down to his side.  
  
  I was positive he hadn’t.  
  
  “Krit, dude.” a male voice called down loudly from what sounded like the second floor. “We got, like, thirty minutes until we gotta be there. Go fucking shower and change.”  
  
  “Shit,” he muttered, glancing down at his phone as he pulled it out of his pocket. “Gotta go. But I’ll see you around, little dancer,” he said with a wink, then stepped back out of the doorway and walked down the hall.  
  
  Little dancer? Oh. I covered my face with both hands. He had seen me spinning around like an idiot. I sure hoped I didn’t see him again. I just wanted to live life without drawing attention to myself. I was leaving that life—the one where people saw me and huddled together while laughing and glancing at me—behind. I didn’t want to give anyone here ammunition to make fun of me. Being invisible couldn’t be that hard.  
  
  Unless you try to talk to guys, genius, I thought to myself. Walking over to the door, I closed and locked it. Next time I wanted to do something like spin in circles, I needed to close my door first.  
  
  KRIT  
  
  Tonight we had a gig at Live Bay. It was a club in town that drew both tourists and locals. We had become a crowd favorite over the past two years, so the three nights a week we played at the club equaled four hundred and fifty dollars for each of us. Live Bay, along with the bar we played at an hour away in Florida, and another club in Mobile, Alabama, both weekly gigs, allowed each of us to clear over a grand a week just performing.  
  
  Green, my best friend and bass guitar in our band, Jackdown, and I shared an apartment. However, we always had people crashing there. We were a family. We had been since we started this thing. Other than my older sister, Trisha, I hadn’t had family, really. Our home life had sucked growing up. Now Trisha had her husband, Rock, and the three kids they’d adopted. She managed to make it most Thursday nights to listen to me play, but that was it now. Used to be that she wouldn’t miss even one of my shows.  
  
  I got it though. I was good with it. She finally had the family she’d always wanted, and she was happy. That was enough. She was a damn good mom, and those kids were lucky she was theirs now.  
  
  We had a good show even though Trish wasn’t there. But the redhead I’d decided to bring home th  
at night was tugging on my arm, needing attention. I hadn’t had enough to drink, and I was lost in my thoughts instead of focusing on her tits, she so wanted me to notice her. I’d noticed already. It was one of the reasons she was going back to my place.  
  
  “You’re ignoring me,” the girl pouted, sticking out her lips, where were painted a deep red. I liked red lips. Another reason she was with me.  
  
  “Easy there. He has an easy trigger after a gig,” Green called back to us from the driver’s seat. He knew how annoyed I could get with clingy needy girls. I just wanted them willing and easy.  
  
  “I’m just making sure he hasn’t changed his mind,” the girl replied.  
  
  “When I change my mind, love, you’ll know it,” I told her, then leaned down to take a taste of her red lips. They had the flavor of the candy she had been sucking on earlier, and beer. It was a good taste. I wanted a little more.  
  
  Green chuckled from the front seat as the car came to a stop. “See, he’s all fun and games if you just let him be,” he said.  
  
  I broke the kiss and got out of the car. I was ready for a drink and some music. And a lot of people. I needed the crowd. “They all coming?” I asked Green as I held out my hand for the girl to take. She quickly scrambled out of the car and clung to me.  
  
  “Probably already here,” he replied. The band liked crashing at our place on nights we played at Live Bay. We kept an open door for any neighbors. Seeing as they were all college students, they never complained. They came and joined the party.  
  
  “What’s your name?” I asked the girl on my arm.  
  
  I glanced down at her to see the pinched frown on her lips. She’d told me earlier, but I hadn’t cared then. I hadn’t been sure I’d be spending the night with her yet. Now I wanted to know. I didn’t fuck a girl if I didn’t know her name.  
  
  “Jasmine,” she replied, then flipped her red hair over her shoulder.  
  
  Jasmine seemed to have a bit of a temper with that red hair of hers. Normally, I was amused but not tonight. I was moody.  
  
  The music was already going when we started up the stairs. There was no doubt it was coming from our apartment. Matty, our drummer, always grabbed a girl or three quickly and left the club after we finished our gig. But most of the time he got to the apartment first if his females didn’t slow him down.  
  
  “Looks like the party has already started. I’m gonna step out early and go find somewhere to study,” Green said as he slowed to walk beside me.  
 Green was almost done with law school. He would be taking the bar exam in six months. I was proud of him, but I also knew things would be changing soon. He wasn’t going to be able to pursue law and live like we were living. He rarely stayed for the parties. He always escaped to go study. Eventually I would lose him, but I wanted him to succeed.  
  
  “We should move the parties to Matty’s from now on,” I said, feeling guilty that Green had to leave his place to be able to study.  
  
  Green shook his head. “Hell, no. The dipshit doesn’t ever clean up, and his apartment is tiny as fuck. Besides, let’s not mess with a good thing. I’ve made it this far doing it this way. It works.”  
  
  Since we’d been kids, Green had been the smart one. The one who always sacrificed. He made things happen. But somehow I had always been the one in the spotlight. Didn’t really seem fair.  
  
  “Just say the word when you want to change that,” I told him, then glanced over at the closed apartment door we were passing.  
  
  A smile tugged on the corner of my lips. Damn, that girl had been adorable twirling around her apartment. I had never seen such long thick hair that was so dark, it was almost black. Then those eyes of hers had been fucking amazing. I wasn’t even sure what color they were exactly. They looked like they were hazel, but they reminded me of jewels. They’d been startling at first.  
  
  Although she had been wearing baggy-ass sweats and an even larger T-shirt, I could see the curves underneath. Sucked that I was only going to have to imagine what they actually looked like because I wasn’t touching that. The innocence pouring off that girl was thick. She had barely been able to form words to talk to me.  
  
  Fucking adorable was what it had been. And I didn’t do adorable. Ever.  
  
  Jasmine’s hand slid down over my jeans and cupped my balls. “I like to suck,” she whispered in my ear.  
  
  “Good. You can show me how much as soon as we get in the room,” I told her, and reached around to cup her ass.  
  
  That had been all the reassurance she needed apparently, because she started unbuttoning my jeans before we reached the door to my apartment. Green turned back to say something to me and saw her hand busy at work with my jeans. He laughed and rolled his eyes then walked into our apartment, which was already full of several of the guys who lived around us, and a few locals who we partied with regularly. Of course, there were plenty of girls. Just in case Jasmine didn’t work out.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  BLYTHE  
  
  The sun broke through the blinds on the windows, waking me up much sooner than I’d wanted to. I reached for my pillow and covered my face with a groan. It had been sometime after three before the noise upstairs had ended and I had been able to fall asleep. I kept waiting for the cops to show up and shut the party down. Surely there had been other people in this complex who had been trying to sleep.  
  
  But the cops never came. The music continued blaring, and the banging on my ceiling had only gotten worse. I hoped they enjoyed themselves, celebrating whatever it was they were celebrating, but I hoped they never did it again. I still had a week before my classes started. Which meant I had a week to get the things I needed and get settled in my apartment.  
  
  Even exhaustion couldn’t keep the smile from creeping across my face. Wearing panties and a tank top, I was about to get up and go fix myself breakfast. Then I was going to sit and eat it in on the sofa and not worry about anyone making me feel unwelcomed. I was free. I was finally alone, and there was no one to disapprove of me.  
  
  Kicking off my covers, I got out of bed and looked down. Normally, the first thing I did when I got up was make the bed or suffer punishment. Now I wasn’t sure if I would ever make my bed again. With a spring in my step I headed for the kitchen to make coffee and toast a bagel.  
  
  Then I would make a list of things I needed for school and my apartment. Although it had come with furniture that Pastor Williams had said was part of the monthly payment, it didn’t have things like curtains or a can opener. The shower curtain was also a plain white. I wanted to add some color, and because I wasn’t supposed to paint the walls, I had to add color elsewhere. Maybe I could find some pillows for the sofa and some pictures for the walls. I didn’t have an unlimited budget, so I needed to be careful.  
  
  I also didn’t start my job for another week, and then it would be another week before I received my first check. Some things would have to wait until later. But I could get started today.  
  
  Clothes. I needed a few outfits that weren’t oversize hand-me-downs or had come from the thrift store. I really needed to buy a few basic things to get me through the next few months of school and work. I couldn’t go to work in what I owned right now. I knew that clothes wouldn’t change the way I looked, but they would at least help me appear more presentable. I decided to keep the pillows that came with the sofa. And the pictures for the walls could wait.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  It took me a little over an hour to find two pairs of shorts and a denim skirt that all hit above my knees. I had never worn anything that showed off my legs before. It was both terrifying and exhilarating. Even better than leaving my bed unmade. Then I had bought one pair of jeans that actually fit me. Almost too well. Once I had bottoms, I went to look for tops. I had bought four blouses and two tank tops. Finally I picked out a pair of tennis shoes that would work best for work and school. They were all I really needed, but the pretty pink high heels kept drawing my attention. I had never had shoes with heels, or shoes that could be considered pretty, for that matter. These weren’t very dressy and could be worn with the skirt and two of my blouses. I could even wear them with the shorts. I had seen girls do that before.  
  
  I tried several times to walk away from them, but in the end I picked up the box with my size and walked to the register to pay for them before I could change my mind again. I was going to live differently here. These heels were a symbol of that new life.  
  
  Carrying all the shopping bags up to my apartment wasn’t exactly fun. I was on the first floor, but I was also on the beach. So I had to walk up a flight of stairs just to get to the first floor. The people above me had even farther to walk. There were no elevators here since it was just the two floors. It took me five trips up and down to get everything into my apartment. But then my energy was renewed with the thrill of getting to put things in their places.  
  
  When I turned to close my apartment door my eyes locked with the electric blue ones I’d seen yesterday. That guy was standing there again, leaning against the door casing with his arms crossed over his chest and a smirk on his face.  
  
  “Looks like someone went shopping bright and early this morning,” he said with that husky voice of his that made my body do funny things.  
  
  I nodded, afraid of the stupidity that would come out of my mouth if I tried to talk to him again. I suddenly wished I had put on one of my new outfits and worn it home. Which was silly. I shouldn’t care what I looked like for this guy.  
  
  “My band plays at Live Bay on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. You should stop in one night and see us. I’ll even buy you a drink during my break,” he said with that amused grin still on his lips.  
  
  Was he teasing me?  
  
  I had to respond this time. Nodding again would be rude. “Okay. I’ll do that one night . . . maybe,” I replied. I wasn’t sure if I would ever go to Live Bay—wherever that was—but telling him no seemed impossible.  
  
  “I’ll look for you then.” He straightened up from his relaxed stance. “I never got your name.”  
  
  My name. He wanted to know my name. I could answer that easily enough. “Blythe?” I replied, wishing it hadn’t sounded like I was asking him instead of telling him.  
  
  He winked. “Fits you,” he replied, then sauntered off without another word. He hadn’t told me his name, but I remembered it from yesterday when his friend had called for him. Krit. It was an unusual name. I wondered what it was short for. Walking over to my door, I closed it and forced all thoughts of how sexy Krit’s eyes had looked without black eyeliner far from my min

  KRIT  
  
  “I need something more than shitty beer,” Legend, our keyboard player, grumbled, sinking down into an overstuffed chair that belonged to Green.  
  
  I leaned forward and kissed the ear of the girl who was in my lap, and I relaxed on the couch. “Why don’t you go fix Legend some whiskey on the rocks, love.” It wasn’t a question, and she knew it. Britt was one of the girls I saw off and on. I didn’t see most girls more than once, but there were a few who were good with no attachments. The fact that Britt was nice and flexible, she was one who I got in the mood for every few weeks or so. Sometimes we saw each other more regularly. Just depended on how things were going in life.  
  
  Legend was busy watching television that couldn’t be heard over the music and voices. There were over thirty people in my apartment. Several were watching the football game on my flat-screen. It was an early night for us. I hadn’t planned on a party tonight, but the guys had shown up, and Green had been free of studying for once. So it happened.  
  
  Britt sashayed over to Legend and bent over while she handed him his drink to make sure I got a good view of her ass. It was barely covered up with the skirt she was wearing. Chuckling at her attempts, I took a drink of my beer and lifted my eyes to see Green standing and talking to someone at our open door.  
  
  Normally, people just came on in, but whoever it was wasn’t coming in. They were just talking to Green. He waved his hand and stepped back in invitation. It was Blythe. Her eyes scanned the room of people nervously, but she didn’t step inside. She also didn’t seem to notice me. Then Green reached out and took her hand and pulled her into the room.  
  
  I only noticed Green’s stupid grin before my eyes snapped back to Blythe. Holy shit, she wasn’t in baggy clothes tonight. Those curves I had thought I had seen hiding beneath those awful clothes were right there for the world to see. A pair of black shorts that showcased legs from fucking heaven was only outdone by the tank top that covered an impressive set of tits. Then put that all together with the glasses perched on her cute little nose. She hadn’t had those on before, but damn, they were sexy.  
  
  I realized Green was walking her over to me. Britt slipped her arm around me, plopped herself back in my lap, and began nibbling on my neck.  
  
  “Uh, dude, can you break free long enough to come here a sec?” Green asked, sounding uncomfortable. Blythe’s eyes grew wide as she watched Britt. Fuck, that innocence was there, shining like a warning sign. As if I needed it. I knew the girl wasn’t my speed. But damn, she was tempting. I wanted to reach up and undo that messy bun she had her hair pulled up in.  
  
  I moved Brit off of my lap and stood up. Blythe’s eyes went from Britt to me, and then she dropped her gaze to study the floor. I noticed Green’s hand resting on her arm as if he was there to jerk her from harm’s way if needed. I didn’t like that. I wasn’t sure why, but I didn’t. She was letting him keep his hand on her too.  
  
  “Did you decide to come join the party, love?” I asked, keeping my grin in place so I didn’t scare her with the snarl I was tempted to give Green. He was a horny bastard. Blythe wasn’t his speed either.  
  
  “No, that’s not why she’s here. Can we take this outside where we don’t have to talk so loud?” Green asked me with a pointed stare. What was his deal?  
  
  Blythe looked back longingly at the door like getting out of there was all she wanted in the world.  
  
  “Sure,” I replied, and Blythe spun around and hurried for the door.  
  
  Green shrugged and turned to follow her.  
  
  I glanced back at Britt, who was watching us closely. I motioned to her that I would be right back, then headed toward the door.  
  
  Green was standing there asking Blythe her name, and Blythe gave him a shy smile that was more than I had ever gotten from her. What the hell? Green wasn’t the charmer. I was.  
  
  “What’s the problem?” I asked as I joined them in the hallway. The annoyed tone in my voice didn’t go unnoticed by Blythe. Her eyes widened, and she started wringing her hands in front of her nervously.  
  
  “Krit, this is our new neighbor, Blythe. She lives directly underneath us,” he said in a tone that was obviously trying to make up for mine.  
  
  “We’ve met,” I told him, swinging my gaze to hers.  
  
  Her cheeks turned bright pink. Why? I hadn’t said anything to embarrass her.  
  
  “Oh, okay. Well, we are being inconsiderate with our noise level. This is two nights in a row that we’ve partied, and Blythe isn’t getting much sleep.”  
  
  So she was here to complain. Interesting. No one had ever complained before. This apartment complex was known for parties. Had she not known that when she moved in here?  
  
  I studied her face as she bit down on her bottom lip and looked ready to bolt. She thought she was going to make me mad. I was pretty damn sure that a girl who looked like her was incapable of making me mad. She gave off the “I need protecting” vibe in a big way. Add that to the heart-stopping face of hers, and she had a winning package deal to get away with all shit, even from me.  
  
  I stepped closer to her, which forced Green to move back some. Reaching down, I pulled one of her hands she was gripping so tightly into mine and ran my finger along the inside of her palm.  
  
  “Why don’t you come inside me with just for a few minutes? Meet some of your neighbors, and then when you’re ready to go, I think I have something that will help with the noise,” I told her as I kept my gaze locked with hers.  
  
  “I, uh, I’m not good with crowds,” she said with an apologetic tone.  
  
  I tugged on her hand until she was almost pressed against me. “I won’t leave your side, and I’m fucking amazing with crowds,” I replied with a wink to let her know I was serious.  
  
  “Don’t make her—” Green started to argue, but I cut him off.  
  
  “Not your business. Back off,” I warned him before sliding my hand around Blythe’s waist and walking her to the door.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  BLYTHE  
  
  I didn’t want to do this. Why had I come up here? Because I was tired and frustrated with the noise. That’s why. I had spent hours writing, then, when I got ready for bed, the noise had started up again. Did these people not need sleep? I just wanted to ask them to be a little quieter. I hadn’t wanted to be forced into staying at the party. I just wanted to go to bed.  
  
  “I really don’t want to do this,” I told Krit, who had his hand on my back and was firmly guiding me inside.  
  
  “Why not? They won’t bite you. I promise, because I won’t fucking let them,” The amusement in his voice bothered me. I wasn’t kidding. I didn’t want to go into this party.  
  
  “Please. I’m sorry I came up here. I will figure out how to sleep through this. Just let me leave.” I was ready to beg now. Whatever I needed to do to get away from this place. I could feel people staring at me. I hated that feeling. I knew what they were thinking. What they saw. I had come up here with my glasses on because I’d needed to see the computer screen, and my hair was in a mess on top of my head. My heart began to race. I had to get out of there.  
  
  “Shit, love, you’re shaking.” Krit’s voice was no longer amused. He stopped walking, and slipped his finger under my chin to tilt my head back. The frown on his face as he studied mine was new. He normally looked constantly amused.  
  
  “Come with me,” he said quietly, and reached down to take my hand. Then he walked down a hallway toward a closed door.  
  
  My panic escalated. That was a bedroom. I wasn’t going into a bedroom with him. I had to get away. I tried to tug my hand loose from his hold, but he threaded his fingers through mine and tightened his grip. No one had ever held my hand before. I stared down at his hand in mine and lost my train of thought for a moment.  
  
  It was a warm feeling having someone’s palm pressed against yours. His fingers laced with mine made me feel like I wasn’t alone. Like I was connected to someone. Had I ever felt that before? I wasn’t sure.  
  
  A door swung open, and Krit pulled me inside before closing it behind me.  
  
   
“Don’t look so terrified. I’m not going to do anything you don’t want me to. Just wanted to get you away from the noise a minute so we could be alone and talk.”  
  
  “Talk?” I asked as his hand released mine. The cold lonely feeling was back. I clasped my hands in an attempt to hold the warmth there. I had liked that warmth.  
  
  “You confuse me. Most girls don’t confuse me. But you, little dancer, have me playing guessing games. Why is that?”  
  
  He called me little dancer again. I wasn’t a dancer. Not even close. But I liked that he had a special name for me. It made me feel like I belonged.  
  
  “I didn’t really get into a social scene growing up. Not very good at that. I don’t fit in.” I hated pointing that out to him. For some reason he didn’t seem to get that I didn’t fit in, and I hadn’t wanted to be the one to break the news to him.  
  
  Krit cocked an eyebrow. “You say that like it’s a bad thing. Most people want to stand out.”  
  
  Stand out? That wasn’t what I meant. I shook my head. “No, that’s not . . . I mean, I don’t . . . I’m not appealing to be around.” That probably made less sense. I wasn’t about to open up to this guy about what was wrong with me. If he didn’t see it, then good. I liked that.  
  
  Krit frowned and stared at me like I was insane. Great. Now he saw the real me. Whatever he had been missing, I had just pointed it out to him. Why hadn’t I kept my mouth shut?  
  
  “You really mean that,” he said in a low whisper as he continued to stare at me. “Who the fuck told you that?”  
  
  I shrugged and turned my gaze from his to study the bedroom we were in. I wasn’t going to answer his question. That was something no one needed to know.  
  
  The walls were a smoky gray color, and the ceiling was painted black. I wasn’t allowed to paint my walls, yet he had painted his. The large king-size bed in the middle of the room was a rumpled mess. An electric guitar sat in one corner, and in the other far corner was an acoustic guitar. I turned my focus to the posters on the walls. Two of them were of what I assumed were rock bands, and there were signatures on them. Then, of course, the other poster was of a naked blonde with really big—and hopefully fake—boobs, because they looked a lot like bowling balls. They couldn’t be real. The blonde was straddling a guitar, and the only thing keeping her private area covered were her hands gripping the guitar between her legs.  
  
  “I wonder if she ever wears panties,” I mumbled out loud before I  could stop myself.  
  
  Krit’s laughter startled me, and I turned to see two very distinct dimples on his face. He didn’t look like the kind of guy who would have dimples, but wow, they did things for me. “I like to believe she doesn’t,” he replied, once he was through laughing.  
  
  “Where are you from?” Krit asked.  
  
  “A small town in South Carolina. You wouldn’t have heard of it,” I replied, feeling the sick knot in my stomach forming, the one that always came with memories of my life there.

I'm Brazilian and I love your YouTube channel.

You REAAAAALLY should cover the tariff's war that Trump is trying to impose to Brazil for 4 reasons:
1. He hates that the ""Tropical Trump"" (Bolsonaro) is going to jail and he is threatening our Supreme Court Justices to let Bolsonaro free.

2. The Big Techs deregulation is one of the other reasons for this attack because our judicial syste has some laws to prevent damages from the digital Wild West. 

3. Brazil has rare earth elements too and probably the Bolsonaro and his son promised  let the USA explore for a really low amount of money an zero fucks given environmental issues.

4. Brazilians really love been mentioned by people from other countries and we have a INSANE online presence, so your numbers will grow so high as Musk everyday. ",1,1754454424.0,AdamMockler,0,1.0,False
1miv5h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/1miv5h1/are_parents_word_truly_the_final_word_im/,Are parent’s word truly the final word? I’m genuinely struggling with this so much right now and every lecture I watch is telling me the exact same thing. But I feel so empty inside,"Disclaimer: A lot of this won’t make sense if you haven’t read my other posts.

I feel like my mental health is at an all time low. It’s been years since the things that my parents have said to me have actually gotten to me and hurt me, but the weekend might’ve been the absolute worst weekend ever. My parents sat my sisters and I down this Saturday and absolutely chewed us out about how disrespectful we’ve been the last few weeks. They’ve apparently lost sleep and couldn’t believe how we just moved on with our lives after my mom packed her stuff and left 2 weeks ago. 

And then the discussion became about respecting your parents and how we have the crazy audacity to speak out against anything they tell us to do. And they acted like we were complete villains, like we were the spawns of shaytaan when all we said was that we didn’t appreciate them supporting the person that has literally made their lives a living hell the last decade and a half of their lives, molested their daughters and came at us and their disabled sons with a knife 2 months ago. 

Then they go, even though your brothers have done a variety of shameful acts (sleeping around, substances, drinking, stealing money from them, anyone, us, stealing their cars, etc) they have never yelled back or spoke back to them as parents. I spoke up and was like, was there any moment that has nothing to do with your molester son where I spoke out of turn to you? I’ve cooked, cleaned, went to school, went to Quran school, took care of the house and my disabled brothers while you both were gone abroad, all while working and in university, but the one time I rightfully put my foot down against an injustice that happened to me, it’s all water under a bridge and it doesn’t matter because it was ages ago? Never mind that he was actively molesting my youngest sister who was 12 at the time, in 2019.

They couldn’t care less because the next thing my dad says is that he wants us to drop our statement that we submitted to the police when he broke in 2 months ago. He said if we didn’t do this that he would kick us out. I told him if you genuinely believe us and don’t care for what he did, you would let him rot in prison for what he’s done. That we were kind enough to not tac on the other myriad of charges that he deserves to live with. He shouldn’t be around his own children unsupervised and you us to drop our statement against him? I told him there’s no way I’m going to do that.

My dad got so angry. Like it was ac
tally scary, I actually thought he would beat the living crap out of me. I ran away ofc, and went outside the back door and stood around in the backyard in my socks😭 I snuck back inside to hear his yelling and I heard my mom trying to placate him, but I was so pissed. Like wtah?? How is he gonna get mad when his stupid son got himself in this dumb mess?? Like genuinely? They just want someone to be mad at. And you know what hes gonna say? If his son was in front of him, only one of them would walk away alive. I’m like that’s great and all, I’m not asking you to murder him, why is it so hard for you to let him rot in prison?? Which is exactly what my sisters end up saying. 

He then goes the same way you’re my daughters and I want to protect you, he’s still my son? Chat, is this not a crazy take? Like genuinely, I’ve been mulling over this for the last few days and??? I can’t come up with anything to rationalize this thought process. It was then magrib time, I came back inside and ran to my room and started packing. My mom was like wth are you doing and I’m like clearly I was just kicked out? And she’s like put your crap down you idiot, you’re not going anywhere. And then she’s like this is for your own good. Yeah like how everything terrible that’s been done to me has been for my own good? You hitting me, shipping me off to Africa, leaving me here alone to take care of the house while your grown and useless sons had to do nothing while I was working and in school from 17 until 20 and I had no life and any time I tried to I was called a wh*re, in the worst depression, and praying to Allah to take my life in my sleep so I wouldn’t be punished for committing? Yeah, we’ve heard that before.

And then she’s going to bring up her other demon spawn, the second oldest that I have issues with, but he’s not a molester, just. grown man that beats on girls half his size and 9+ yrs younger than him. And she’s like you’ve never called the cops on him, and I’m like you guys never had this weird fixation on him like you do your freak oldest. Besides, you guys would still act like this if I did this. Mind you, my 24M has definitely called the police on both of them, it’s just a problem when we do it. Sometimes, I can’t help but feel like they just wanted us to die that night, I’d least I’d be dead knowing that he would locked up for life and there would be nothing my parents would be able to do about it. 

I then tell her, you would never let any of us get away with what any of your sons have done. Look at how you guys are yelling at us for calling the cops on a drunk loser that broke into your house. And then she’s like ofc we’d support you the same way we support them💀 Don’t make me laugh. Support?? You would’ve kicked us out at the first strike, like you guys are now, even though there is nothing more that can happen in this situation to victimize us more than we already are and YOURE STILL ON HID SIDE. How are you made that we’re disappointed that you’re laughing with our molester?? Genuinely, how? And I told her it’s quite obvious you favor all your sons than you ever did us. You’ve never liked us. You’ve only ever tolerated us. 

She walked away afterwards. I kept packing and snuck a shower in, if I didn’t end up getting kicked out. I didn’t, I kind of wish that happened. We sat down again, and then my dad brought up the story of Prophet Ibrahim AS and how when Allah told him to slaughter his son, Ismael AS, that Ismael AS told him father to do as Allah swt instructed. And I was like no way. But I guess I can see it from that point. Don’t retract your statement for your own personal feelings, but rather because your parents instructed you to do, in that sense. But I can’t like I still don’t want to. They were saying “if” the legal team ends up needing it, and ofc they’re paying for his defense😍 And in the same breath, my dad is going to yell at us for not helping to pay the bills… Mind you none of his sons have ever paid a single penny to him, forget the thousands of dollars they’ve put both of them into debt, at least $100k in the last decade, but sure your daughters getting 2 packages delivered in the same week and food every once in a while and paid for with the money they earned is the real issue here….


But I just told them sure. I apologized, I didn’t want to. And then my dad is going to co
plain about how we don’t want to apologize and how he can tell from our body language… And then my mom is going to chime in and say these girls genuinely believe that they’re not supported and that we’re the reason behind what happened decades ago, some random stuff that happened once or twice (she’s talking about her son molesting us btw), shouldn’t dictate everything🫩 Right. And she’s like ofc I like you guys more than the boys, we talk and have girl time together and I can’t do that with the boys. And I’m like, I genuinely resent myself for having any conversation I’ve had with you ever. You think we’re close because you can spill your feelings and troubles onto us, but whenever we do the same, we’re completely wrong about how we are feeling. We’ve told her several times we were molested, and each time she brushed it off in the last decade. And now every time we bring it up, she acts like she was none the wiser and that it was our fault for not detailing it for her. 

We eventually gave up and just pretended that we moved on, ofc we didn’t and they just insist on shoving that freak into every single crevice of their lives and forcing him in ours too. 

Im going to stop talking to them. My sisters and I have already determined that we are moving next winter. We’ll just become yes man until we do. I’m going to work on my independence, get my own line, my own car, save up, pay off whatever debts I have, etc. I can’t live like this. Funny enough, I told my mom this that night I was “kicked out”, that I didn’t know what they wanted from us and that it seemed like they just wanted to yell at somebody because they couldn’t do it properly to anyone else without getting results, and that I was sick of living here and dealing with this. And she just gave me the most disgusted look ever💀💀 

It was a wake up call, not that I needed one. But it’s just getting worse and worse. I cried all Sunday and Monday after they forced us to apologize. I was seething in rage until it just hit me like what did i ever do them for them to hate us like this. I’ve tried to be best daughter ever. We bought them expensive gifts we saved up to buy, bought them coffee, cooked for them, cared for them, helped out as much as we could, just for them to equate us saying not to retracting a police statement to the horrible and disgusting things their sons have been doing since the dawn of time. We’re even worse in their eyes. I didn’t look at their faces for days. And my mom wants to act normal, but I’m so short with her, I don’t even want to talk to her.

I’m trying to hold it together, but I just feel so miserable inside. I thought I got over this, and I already know how little they feel toward us, but the reminders hurt. Every week my dad wants a “meeting” just to yell at us. And he’ll call my younger siblings and 24M over just to make passive aggressive remarks about us  and I’m so sick of it. All I’ve been doing is crying these days and I hate crying so much. And I’m scared I’m going to go back into that debilitating depression and I can’t be stuck in a rut like that right now when I need to be moving forward more than ever. And I just don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been trying to listen to lectures, but every single one is telling me the same thing, that listening to our parents is key to being a good Muslim. And I already struggle so much with the deen and my imaan and I’m scared that this is pushing me away even more when I know I’m supposed to be turning to Allah right now and asking for His guidance. I just feel so gross around them all the time, I hate being at this house, I’m upping my hours at work, but even then they have snide remarks about that, and I’m just sick of it all.

1miv3iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1miv3iw/what_helped_the_most_in_healing_guttate_psoriasis/,What helped the most in healing Guttate Psoriasis.,"**Purpose**

1. Share information about guttate psoriasis. 
2. Take feedback from people who try this protocol. 
3. Document the feedback and update the protocol to help others. 
4. Let's learn and heal together. 

**Cause of Guttate psoriasis**

Overgrowth of specific fungal strain. This fungus can also cause dandruff. This fungus naturally exists on humans. But under some circumstances it can over grow causing skin/scalp issues. 

**Dermatologist approach**

When we go to dermatologists, they talk about suppressing the immune system using drugs. 

**Why I don't agree with dermatologists**

Immune system should be strong as it is super important for the body. If immune system is not working well, then we should make it work well. We should not suppress it.

**Healing Approach**

Plenty of TLC for immune system. 

1. Avoid anything that hurts immune system.

2. Give all input needed for immune system to work well.

**What to avoid?**

1. Sugar, corn syrup all kinds of sugars for sometime.

2. Deep Fried food

3. Red meat

4. yeast Bread and anything with mold inhibitors, white bread

5. processed foods.

6. Food colors.

7. coffee (not recommended)

8. Night shade vegetables when breakouts are bad. You can take them in moderation once you heal. Watch if there are any triggers.

Egg plant, potato, tomato, chilies, bell pepper are night shades. Some people react more to egg plant. Avoid any green potatoes, green tomatoes as they are higher in solanine. Once you heal completely, control how often and how much you eat nightshades based on your body's reaction. Tomatoes in summer might do more good than harm. Excess tomatoes in winter might harm. Weather has an impact on how we cope with a certain food. Bell peppers even through they are night shade, they may not offend much. Please post your experience.

9. Watch how you react to common allergens, corn, eggs, dairy, wheat, peanuts etc. If you have severe outbreak, you may have to avoid them.

**What to eat/do?**

1. Sun shine when weather is pleasant. If you can get it daily without sunburn that is ideal.

2. Proper hydration(minerals), alkaline water (essentia water), coconut water, herbal teas, eating water rich vegetables in summer. Celery, cucumbers in summer, Make sure you get adequate hydration based on age, weight, exercise and weather. 

3. Exercise walking in sunlight, gardening, any form of exercise you like. But exercising outdoors in sunlight is optimal. Running in sunlight heals fast especially in pleasant weather.

4. Sleep especially at night time.

5. Controlling stress/mindfulness/prayer. Our gut is influenced by stress. Try to reduce stress in general. But if you can't change stressful circumstances, please work on your response to stressors, try to consciously cultivate positive thinking, positive feelings, realistic positive response to situations. Try breathing and prayer to relax. Try to fix what you can. Please don't worry about what you can't fix.

6. Try to get a variety of vegetables that are in season. Get vegetables from all vegetable families/groups. Some root vegetables, some cruciferous vegetables, leafy greens etc. 

7. Eat high fiber, high nutrient less sugary fruits such as, pomegranate, papaya, blue berry, black berry, guava when they are in season.

8. Eat wild caught fish. It heals very well as it is high in DHA. farm raised fish is NOT  healing.

9. Eat some sesame, flax, chia. Soak chia in 10 to 20 times more water for few hours than consume add them to your meals or smoothies.

10. Eat different types of beans. Black beans help with reducing inflammation.

11. Consume turmeric, ginger, cumin, coriander, black seeds(nigella sativa) and other spices as part your diet/food.

12. Cooking oil: Usually olive oil or avocado oil are good. Cold pressed oils are better, Avoid processed industrialized oils and snacks made from them. 

13. Whole grains: Siri Dhanya, millet, rye, teff, whole wheat are okay. 

14. Try eating a salad or drinking green smoothie daily. 

**Supplements**

1. Black seed oil (Nigella sativa)
2. Wild caught fish oil
3. Turmeric
4. Vitamin D
5. Probiotics (Florajen for digestive health)
6. Magnesium (if you have sleep/constipation issues)

**Scalp/Skin Care**

Use gentle dandruff shampoo once or twice a week. If scalp has dandruff, you can try coconut oil, use gentle soft brush to brush off, then shampoo it regularly. Remember not to not transfer fungus from one place to another on skin.

Try epsom salt baths.

**Emotional Care**

Please remember you deserve love and care. Please love and take good care of your body, mind and soul.

**My expectations from you**

If you try these recommendations, could you please reply and let us know the results? It will help others.  

1. What kind of psoriasis did you had?
2. How long you had it?
3. Did you follow all of the above tips?

Things come back to me in pieces. Some people who were there mere days leading up to his passing will tell me I was sweet, tender, and fierce. Fighting for him every step of the way and also realizing these were his last. Very exhausting. My mother, who had been fighting cancer, decided she was ready for hospice. I stayed with my mom for weeks. My dad, who’s been with her for 50 years, stayed right by her side too. He held her hand. He sang to her. He reassured her. He knew what to say to make her smile. Alone, my dad told me he was worried about us girls (my 3 sisters and myself). He didn’t want to see us hurt. I told him we would be fine. That it would be him who would hurt the most. He said he didn’t know. I asked him, “What is the first thing you think of or do each morning when you wake up?” He replied, “Momma of course. I make sure she’s ok. Get our coffee going and make us breakfast and figure out what she’d want to do for the day.” And so I asked, “What are you going to do when she’s not here to do those things with you?” He was silent. He was silent almost 5 minutes. So I went on and told him that although losing my mother will be difficult, that I’ll still be alright but it’s him who would hurt the most. And I was only telling him from experience. He still didn’t respond. The next few days after that he was different. Maybe I should have said nothing to him. I only thought it fair that I should warn him of what lies ahead. Just like all of us here know now. I wasn’t told this before my husband passed. They’d just tell me it’ll get better. Not that my whole world would be shattered or figuring out how to live without my soulmate. Seeing the love my mother and father shared until she passed was bittersweet. I like to imagine that’s how others seen me and my husband. So last year I lost my husband. This year (just 2 weeks ago) I’ve lost my dear mother. 2026 better give me a break.

Here’s a little about me: I don’t have a lot of time for social stuff; I work all the time. I have friends, I do stuff, but I’m always working when my friends are free. They are married and have kids—thrilled for them, but so vastly different from my own life; hence why I am here.

I enjoy reading—fiction, autobiographies, but mainly fiction; sleeping in on weekends; watching Netflix; exploring cafes; drinking iced coffee; and singing loudly to my music.

I am a night owl, and that probably won’t change. It's normal for me to drink Coca-Cola with lots of ice and listen to audiobooks or watch a series or a movie.

I vote blue, so please only message me if you are similar in that sense. Also, if you spend a lot of time playing video games, don’t message me. 

I'm interested in chatting with individuals aged 25-46 who reside in the United States or Canada. Wishing everyone the best of luck in their search

Now it is minimum $5.85. I didn’t stop going because of any of the things he is trying to change. 

I stopped going because of sticker shock and the iced coffee changed.

1miuvyg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1miuvyg,Fudge Brownie Macarons,"Fudge Brownie Macaron Recipe

Macaron Shells:

* 100g Almond Flour (1 cup)
* 100g Powdered Sugar (3/4 cup)
* 10g Unsweetened Cocoa Powder (2 tbsp)
* 100g Egg Whites (room temperature,about 3 large eggs)
* 5 ml Vanilla Extract (optional, 1 tsp)
* 800 mg Cream of Tartar (optional, 1/4 tsp)
* 100g Granulated Sugar (1/2 cup)


Fudge Brownie Filling:

* 2/3 cup Semisweet Chocolate Chips
* 1/3 cup Heavy Cream
* 1 tsp Instant Coffee 
* Pinch of Salt 
* Homemade or Store Bought Brownies (I used store bought miniature bakery brownies) 

Instructions:

1. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. You may want to trace 1-1/2’’ circles spaced a few inches apart on the back of each side of parchment paper as a guide for piping macaron shells later.

2. Sift almond flour, powdered sugar, and cocoa powder together through a fine mesh sieve. Discard any remaining clumps left in the sieve. Sift through at least two times. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl with an electric hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar and vanilla and continue to beat until incorporated. SLOWLY add in granulated sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. The mixture should create a thick, glossy meringue that holds its shape when you stop the mixer. If the peaks don’t hold their shape well, continue to beat a bit longer. Careful not to mix at too high a speed for too long, which can cause the meringue to break.

4. Begin folding in 1/3 of the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula, pulling from underneath the batter and dropping onto the surface. Continue to mix the batter by hand, lifting and dropping in a J-shaped motion until the mixture begins to loosen and reaches a consistency of flowing lava. If you lift the spatula full of batter from the bowl, it should drizzle off in a thick ribbon and melt in on itself after about 10 seconds. You should also be able to draw a figure 8 with the batter in the bowl about 1 or 2 times over before it falls off. If it falls off in blobs rather than a ribbon, continue to fold. If the mixture immediately melts in on itself like honey or shampoo, you have probably mixed a bit too far. 

5. Transfer the macaron batter to a pastry bag fitted with a large round piping tip. Or use a large heavy-duty ziploc bag with one corner cut off. Pipe the macarons into 1 - 1/2"" circles on the prepared parchment or silicone-lined baking sheets, spacing them a couple inches apart. When the trays are filled, rap them a few times on the counter to help remove air bubbles from the shells, then let them sit out for 30 - 60 minutes until the tops are dry to the touch. 

6. Preheat oven to 300°F. Bake for 16 - 18 minutes. Let the shells cool completely before removing them from parchment paper or silicone mats. 


For the Ganache Filling:

1. Add chocolate chips, instant coffee, and salt into a medium sized heat-proof bowl. 

2. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over a medium-low heat until it begins to simmer, or until bubbles start forming around the edges of the surface. Careful not to boil the cream. 

3. just as the cream reaches a simmer, immediately remove from the heat and pour over the chocolate. Let the mixture sit without stirring for 3 - 4 minutes to let the hot cream begin melting the chocolate gently. 

4. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir the mixture together until smooth. Work from the center outward in small circular motions. If the mixture is too runny, chill in the fridge until it firms up. Transfer to a piping bag when it reaches the desired consistency. You can use the ganache how it is, or you can also whip the ganache with a whisk for a more frosting-like consistency. 

For Assembly: 

1. Chop the brownies up into small chunks. Set aside.

2. Pipe a ring of ganache around the edges of 1/2 of the macarons shells. 

3. Complete the filling by pressing the brownie chunks into the middle of the ganache ring. Sandwich with another shell to complete the macaron. 

4. For best taste and texture, chill covered in an airtight container in the fridge overnight. These can also be frozen for up to 2 - 3 months. 



Notes: 

* Vanilla and cream of tartar are optional because vanilla adds flavor, but is unnecessary for this recipe. Cream of tartar is a stabilizer for the egg whites to help create a stiffer meringue. It’s really only necessary on more humid days, but I use it every time as an added precaution.

He claimed she had the Moon Sickness and would die if he didn't mark her.

I fought him on it, but the next day, he moved Seraphina right into the penthouse of the Pack House.

The suite meant for the future Luna.

My suite.

To calm me, he even got on his knees, his eyes red as he promised, ""Once she's safe, I'll remove the mark. You'll still be my only Luna.""

But then, Seraphina found me, a medical report in her hand.

Six weeks pregnant.

They'd already held their marking ceremony long before Damien ever came to me.

My heart shattered into ash.

My pen dug into the calendar, carving a vicious X over the date that was supposed to be our Mating Ceremony.

Then, I opened my laptop and replied to the email from the European Laurel Healers' Guild.

""I accept your invitation. I leave on the day of the Mating Ceremony.

Chapter 1

Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Damien, said he needed to mark another she-wolf, Omega Seraphina—the one who’d supposedly saved his life.

""I have to give Seraphina a temporary mark. She's dying, Isla. The Moon Sickness is eating her alive.""

Damien’s gaze was heavy on me.

I stopped mixing the moon petal elixir in my hands.

It was for our Mating Ceremony, said to make the mate bond even stronger.

And now, he wanted me to accept him marking another woman.

My fingertips started to tremble.

""Are you fucking kidding me?""

""It's the only way to save her."" Damien turned away, unable to meet my eyes.

Those deep blue eyes I once loved were now a storm of conflict and chilling resolve.

""I owe her my life.""

""I don't care what you owe her!"" My voice went sharp. ""A mark is sacred, Damien! It's supposed to be for us—""

""One month,"" he cut me off, his eyes bloodshot, a flicker of confusion in them as if he genuinely couldn't understand my resistance.

""I promise, I'll remove the mark right after the ceremony. She'll live, and you'll still be my only Luna.""

I stared at him, my jaw tight. ""I don't agree. Unless you want to cut our mate bond.""

Damien's eyes finally turned to ice. ""This isn't a request, Isla. A life is at stake. Don't make me force this.""

He promised, ""It’s just a temporary mark. It won’t affect our bond. In a month, everything will be back to normal.""

Then he stormed out, slamming the door.

His Alpha scent, thick with anger, clung to the air long after he was gone.

The next day, I was standing at the entrance to the Pack Headquarters when a long, black sedan pulled up.

My whole body went numb.

Damien got out of the passenger seat and gently helped a delicate, fragile figure out of the car.

Seraphina.

She looked so pale, like a strong gust of wind could knock her over.

Damien's arm was wrapped around her waist, a protective gesture that sent a wave of nausea through me.

""Watch the steps,"" he said, his voice so gentle it made me want to scream.

It was a tone he had never once used with me.

I watched them walk into the building and get on the elevator.

Headed straight for the top floor.

For the luxury suite reserved only for the future Luna.

My suite.

Three hours later, Damien came back to our apartment.

I was waiting for him on the sofa, a cup of cold tea clutched in my hand.

""Is she settled in?"" My voice was so calm it scared me.

Damien took off his jacket. ""The pack healer said she needs a quiet environment.""

""So you put her on the top floor.""

""It has the best facilities,"" he said, avoiding my eyes. ""It's just temporary.""

I stood up and slowly walked toward him.

""Damien, where were you last night?""

He froze for a second. ""Dealing with a border dispute. I told you.""

""All night?""

""It was more complicated than I expected.""

I stepped closer, close enough to smell the scent of another she-wolf on him.

The commingled scent was a poisoned needle, stabbing straight through our mate bond.

A sharp, tearing pain ripped through my soul, and I almost buckled.

It wasn't just Seraphina’s scent. It was deeper, more intimate.

The kind of deeply blended scent that only comes from a true Mating mark.

He had lied.

He wasn't dealing with a border dispute last night.

He was performing their marking ceremony.

And now, he was still trying to get my permission for something that was already done.

""Do you even still need my permission?"" I took a step back, fighting the tears welling in my eyes.

""You have to understand, Isla. A life is at stake."" Damien moved toward me, trying to take my hand.

""You're my fated mate,"" he insisted, as if that explained everything. ""You should be on my side.""

I yanked my hand away. ""I need more time.""

""There is no time. She won't last much longer.""

Just then, the elevator to the penthouse opened.

Seraphina stepped out, draped in a white silk robe I'd never seen before.

Her cheeks were flushed with a sickly pink, but her eyes were bright.

She walked straight to Damien and leaned against his chest.

""Thank you, Damien,"" she said, her voice weak but sweet, her eyes fixed directly on me.

""I feel so much better already.""

**Chapter2**

I didn't sleep all night.

After Seraphina retreated to the penthouse, Damien followed her up.

""She needs someone to look after her,"" was the only explanation he gave.

I sat in our empty apartment, the memory of that mark—its scent—replaying over and over in my mind.

The tear in our bond throbbed, a constant, agonizing reminder.

Then it hit me.

Three weeks ago.

That night.

Damien had said he was going to handle a border dispute and didn't come back until the next morning.

That night, I lay in bed, fighting back waves of searing pain that tore through our bond.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that Damien had been hurt in the conflict.

I only breathed a sigh of relief when he finally returned.

His clothes had the faint scent of laurel leaves on them.

The sacred incense burned only during a Mating Rite.

I'd even asked him, ""Did you go to the Sacred Grove?""

He'd said, ""Just passing by.""

It never even crossed my mind that he would betray me. Betray our fate.

Now I understood.

He had already marked Seraphina that night.

And I, like a fool, had been sitting here worrying about his safety.

At dawn, my phone buzzed.

An encrypted email.

From: The Laurel Healers' Guild.

""Dear Miss Isla, we formally invite you to participate in our research initiative on Ancient Life Energies. This is the highest honor for a healer and the perfect place for your talents. Should you be interested, we hope for a response within the week.""

I stared at the screen.

This was the opportunity I had dreamed of my entire life.

It was also my only way out.

Damien walked in just as I was packing my things.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing my herbs,"" I said without looking up. ""Since the penthouse has a new occupant, I don't want to be in the way.""

""Isla, listen to me—""

""There's nothing to say."" I stood up and looked him dead in the eye. ""The Mating Ceremony,"" I stated, my voice dangerously calm, ""is off.""

The color drained from Damien's face.

""You can't do that.""

""I can,"" I said, turning back to my packing. ""I refuse to mate with an Alpha who has already marked someone else.""

""I told you, it's temporary!"" he yelled, grabbing my arm. ""I'll remove the mark in a month!""

""And then what?"" I shook him off. ""You think I'll ever trust you again?""

Pain flashed in Damien's eyes. ""She's dying, Isla. I can't just stand by and watch her die.""

""Why?"" I demanded. ""Because you owe her? Owe her for what?""

Damien fell silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

""If you won't tell me, then we have nothing to talk about."" I walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Damien scrambled after me, his powerful frame dropping to one knee before me. ""I promise you, in one month, I will give you the grandest ceremony this continent has ever seen. Every pack in North America will be there to witness it.""

I looked down at him, kneeling.

It wasn't pity I felt, but a bitter sense of absurdity and injustice.

Were our five years together, our fated bond, really going to end over a lie?

Was I really going to give up this easily?

In that moment of hesitation, the elevator doors opened.

Seraphina stepped out.

Seeing Damien on his knees, a fleeting, triumphant smirk touched her lips.

She walked right up to me and deliberately handed me a file folder.

""Isla,"" she said, her voice soft. ""I know you're a healer, too. This is my medical report. Could you take a look? Damien's Alpha energy is so powerful. I've been recovering so well since the marking, but... there's been an unexpected side effect. I'm a little scared.""

I took the report, my eyes scanning the data.

As a top-tier healer, I spotted the discrepancy immediately.

Six weeks pregnant.

But Damien had only completed the marking less than three weeks ago.

The dates didn't add up.

I looked up, my gaze cold, and handed the report to Damien.

""Congratulations,"" I said, my voice dripping with ice. ""It seems this 'side effect' began long before the 'temporary mark'.""

Then, without a second glance at his shocked and questioning face, I walked back into my room.

I looked at the calendar, at the bright red circle around our Mating Ceremony date.

It was now my departure date.

The countdown: thirteen days.

I opened my laptop and clicked reply.

""I accept your invitation. ""

Chapter3

That night, Damien didn't come back to our apartment.

I knew where he was.

The next morning, I opened the pack's secure network.

The top post was a new update.

Alpha Damien had ordered a hundred thousand dollars' worth of rare supplements for Seraphina.

Blood Ginseng, Moonlight Fungus, and Starfruit—things only needed during a werewolf pregnancy.

The comments section exploded.

""Is our Alpha going to be a father?""

""But isn't Isla his Luna?""

""I heard that Seraphina girl moved into the penthouse.""

""Isn't the Mating Ceremony next week?""

I shut my phone off.

At noon, I met my best friend, Chloe.

""You what?"" Chloe's voice was so sharp it nearly shattered her coffee cup. ""You're calling off the ceremony?""

""That's right.""

""Are you insane? He's your fated mate!""

""Fated mates don't mark other women right before their ceremony,"" I said, calmly sipping my coffee. ""And they certainly don't get another she-wolf pregnant with their pup.""

Chloe gasped. ""A pup?""

I showed her the photo of the lab report on my phone.

""That scheming bitch!"" Chloe slammed her hand on the table. ""She played you!""

""Probably,"" I shrugged. ""But it doesn't matter anymore.""

""Isla, you can't just give up. Damien loves you.""

""Loves me?"" I gave a bitter laugh. ""Does someone who loves you mark another woman behind your back?""

Chloe fell silent.

""I've already accepted the invitation from the European Healers' Guild,"" I said, standing up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

""So soon?""

""If I stay any longer, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret.""

At eleven that night, I got back to the apartment building after an herb exchange.

The gathering was a success.

I’d met several healers from Europe, including a few Alphas I’d never seen before.

When the elevator doors opened, Damien was standing there.

His eyes were cold, his nostrils flaring slightly. ""Where were you?""

""An herb exchange.""

""With who?"" he pressed.

""Some colleagues.""

Damien stalked towards me, like a predator closing in on its prey. ""Don't lie to me. I smell another male's scent on you. An Alpha's.""

""So what if you do?""

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes. ""Get away from me, and wash that scent off you.""

""You don't get to order me around.""

""I'm your fated mate!""

""No, you're not,"" I said, pushing past him. ""You're Seraphina's.""

I walked towards our apartment, Damien following close behind.

But instead of arguing, he went straight to the armchair by the fireplace, sat down, and closed his eyes.

I knew what he was doing.

The mind-link.

His expression softened, and I could feel the murmur of his thoughts through our strained bond.

The pup is going to be so strong, so healthy.

The pup.

He was already looking forward to it.

I turned to go to my room.

""Isla.""

His voice stopped me.

""There's something about the ceremony I need to talk to you about.""

Chapter4

I stopped and turned, my face a cold mask. ""What is it now?""

""It's about the Rite of the Moon Spring."" He opened his eyes, and those deep blue pools held an undeniable command. ""I need to postpone it.""

""Why."" It wasn't a question.

""Seraphina's pregnancy is unstable. The healer said the pure energy of the Moon Spring would be good for her. So...""

He paused, as if searching for the right words. ""I've decided it's better if she has it.""

Let her have it.

He said it so casually, as if he were just rescheduling a meeting.

That was the highest honor for a Luna, to receive the pack's blessing.

It was the sacred moment we had dreamed of together.

My heart was numb.

I couldn't even feel the pain anymore.

I answered in the calmest voice I could manage. ""Fine.""

My calmness seemed to unnerve him. ""You... don't have anything else to say?""

""No.""

""...Good."" A flicker of relief crossed his face, as if he'd expected a bigger fight.

He then continued, his tone all business. ""I'm taking Seraphina to a private retreat in the Rockies. Handle the ceremony preparations. Don't bother me with the details unless the world is ending.""

He cut the link.

I walked out to the balcony.

It used to be my herb garden, filled with rare plants I'd cultivated for the future of our pack.

I had imagined using these herbs to heal our people, to protect our home.

Damien had never set foot out here.

He said he wasn't interested in ""all these flowers and weeds.""

Now, they had lost their meaning, too.

I started working, one by one, uprooting the plants I had so carefully nurtured, the sharp snap of roots and the damp scent of earth filling the air.

It was a funeral for a future that was now dead and buried.

Each one represented a betrayed hope.

When the last Stardust Bloom was in its box, I took out my phone and opened the calendar.

On the date I had marked countless times for the ""Rite of the Moon Spring,"" I drew a heavy, red X.

The countdown: twelve days.

Chapter5

Over the next week, my phone was flooded with notifications.

Seraphina's social media was on fire.

A picture of her lying in a bed at a luxury resort in the Rockies, Damien sitting beside her, peeling an apple.

Her in a hot spring, with Damien on the edge, holding a towel ready for her.

Her during a prenatal check-up, Damien holding her hand tightly.

Every photo had the same caption: ""Thank you, Damien, for taking such good care of me. I've never felt so safe.""

I didn't need to read the comments.

""The Alpha is so good to her.""

""Now that's what true love looks like.""

""What about Luna Isla? We never see her.""

""I heard she's busy with her career.""

I turned off my phone and went back to packing.

On the third day, I drove to my parents' house.

""Isla?"" My mother opened the door, surprised. ""What are you doing here?""

""I need to talk to you both.""

In the living room, my father put down his newspaper and looked at me.

""What is it?""

""I'm going to Europe.""

""For a vacation?""

""For work. The Laurel Healers' Guild invited me to join a research project."" I took a deep breath. ""I might be gone for a long time.""

My mother's face fell. ""What about your ceremony?""

""It's been postponed.""

""Postponed?"" My father frowned. ""Why?""

""Damien has some things to take care of,"" I said, trying to sound calm. ""We thought it would be better to hold it later.""

My parents exchanged a look.

""Isla, don't lie to us,"" my mother said, her voice gentle but firm as she took my hand. ""We're your parents. We can see the pain in your eyes. Tell us what he did.""

I closed my eyes. ""It's nothing, Mom. I just want to learn more while I'm young.""

""Does Damien agree with this?""

""He's very supportive of my career.""

Another lie.

My father was silent for a long time before finally nodding. ""If it's for your career, we support you.""

""But you have to stay in touch,"" my mother said, her eyes glistening with tears. ""And take care of yourself.""

After leaving my parents' house, I texted Chloe.

""Can you come help me pack?""

An hour later, Chloe was at my apartment door.

""My god, what happened here?"" she asked, staring at the empty living room.

""I'm moving.""

""Moving where?""

""Switzerland.""

Chloe sat on the couch and studied my face. ""Okay. Now tell me the truth. What the hell happened?""

I told her everything.

From Damien demanding to mark Seraphina, to the pregnancy report, to the canceled Rite of the Moon Spring.

When I finished, the living room was dead silent.

Chloe's face grew darker and darker.

""That bastard!"" she suddenly exploded. ""How could he do this to you?""

""He had his reasons.""

""What reasons? Life debt?"" Chloe stood up and started pacing. ""Even if he owed her his life, he has no right to trample all over you like this!""

""Chloe—""

""No, I won't accept this!"" She spun to face me, her eyes burning. ""Five years ago, on the Blood Moon, you nearly tore your soul in half to save him from a rogue attack! And now he has the audacity to remember only her so-called 'kindness'?""

I looked away, saying nothing.

Chapter6

Five days until the ceremony.

I walked into the Pack Council chamber, dressed in a black power suit.

All the Elders were waiting for me.

""Isla, are you certain about this?"" the Head Elder asked, his voice grave.

""I am."" I placed the formal request on the table. ""I am petitioning to suspend the Mating Ceremony.""

The chamber fell silent.

""Why?"" the Second Elder asked.

""Personal reasons.""

""Personal reasons?"" the Third Elder stood up. ""This is about an alliance between two powerful families!""

""That's your concern,"" I said, turning to leave. ""My decision is final.""

Furious discussion erupted behind me, but I didn't look back.

When I got back to the apartment building, I saw the familiar black sedan.

They were back.

The elevator doors opened, and Damien and Seraphina were standing inside.

Seraphina looked well, a healthy flush on her cheeks.

Damien's arm was still wrapped protectively around her waist.

""Isla?"" Damien's eyes widened in surprise when he saw me. ""Where have you been?""

""Taking care of some business.""

We rode up together in a tense, suffocating silence.

""You cleared out the herb garden?"" Damien asked as he pushed open our apartment door and saw the empty balcony.

""Gave it away.""

""Why?""

""I don't need it anymore.""

Damien frowned but didn't press further.

Seraphina walked onto the balcony, feigning surprise. ""Wow, it's so empty. I bet it was beautiful before.""

""It was fine.""

""Isla, I'm so grateful for your understanding,"" Seraphina said, turning to me, a strange light in her eyes.

""Why don't we all have dinner together tonight? I'd love to thank you properly.""

I just stared at her.

Seeing my coldness, Seraphina's expression immediately changed, her eyes welling up with tears.

""Did... did I say something wrong?"" She turned to Damien, her voice trembling. ""I just wanted to show my gratitude...""

Damien's face instantly darkened.

""Isla,"" he growled, his voice laced with the Alpha command. ""Control yourself. Seraphina is our guest. You are making her uncomfortable.""

I looked at him calmly. ""Fine.""

At dinner, the nutrient broth arrived.

Damien had ordered it specially for Seraphina.

I recognized the scent immediately: Heart-leaf, an herb whose properties only activate for a she-wolf bonded to the Alpha who serves it.

He served a bowl and handed it to me. ""You should have some too. It's good for you.""

I took the bowl and sipped.

A foreign, repulsive energy instantly warred with my own.

My body recoiled, the rejection a physical, agonizing proof of his betrayal.

Damien froze.

He had forgotten.

That herb no longer worked for me.

My phone rang.

Ignoring Damien, I stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind me before answering in a hushed voice.

""Miss Isla? This is the secretary from the Laurel Guild. Your flight has been confirmed.""

""Good,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. ""The ceremony is off. I'm ready to leave.""

Just as I hung up, a deep, commanding voice came from behind me.

""Who's leaving?""

Chapter7

I spun around. Damien was standing just outside the balcony door, his eyes like chips of ice.

The lingering pain from the energy clash had made me forget—an Alpha’s hearing could cut straight through walls.

Thank the Goddess, he hadn’t heard everything.

""A healer friend of mine,"" I answered calmly , stepping past him and back into the dining room. ""She's going to South America to study new herbs.""

Damien walked over and sat back down. ""Which friend?""

""You don't know her.""

""Her name.""

""Why should I tell you?""

Seraphina coughed softly from the side. ""Damien, don't be so hard on Isla. A girl's secrets are important.""

Her words seemed to calm him down.

""Sorry,"" he said to me, though his eyes were still full of suspicion.

But he didn’t press further, seeming reluctant to sour the mood any more.

His gaze softened as he turned to Seraphina, pulling a beautiful box from his jacket.

""What's that?"" Seraphina asked curiously.

""It's for you.""

Inside was an obsidian pendant, carved with intricate runes.

I could read them clearly: Damien & Seraphina, Forever Bonded.

""It's gorgeous!"" Seraphina exclaimed, putting it on. ""Is this a mate's token?""

""Mmmhmm."" Damien fastened the chain for her. ""I've infused it with my Alpha energy. It will protect you and the pup.""

He took out his phone and snapped a picture of her in the mirror.

""Smile.""

She beamed like a child, her eyes shining with pure happiness.

Damien immediately sent her the photo with the caption: My precious one.

""It suits you,"" I commented.

Damien looked at me, a flicker of distance in his eyes.

The next afternoon, I went to the werewolf-exclusive apothecary to buy some last-minute travel supplies.

As I reached the door, I heard a familiar voice inside.

""Check the heartbeat again.""

It was Damien.

Through the glass, I could see Seraphina lying on a treatment bed, with Damien standing nervously beside her.

""Everything's normal,"" the pack healer said. ""The pup is very healthy.""

""Thank you,"" Damien said, taking Seraphina's hand. ""The healer says the pup will be very strong.""

I turned to leave, but the chime of the door gave me away.

""Isla?"" Seraphina called out from inside. ""Are you here for herbs too?""

""Just passing by.""

""Wait, we can leave together,"" she called back to Damien. ""I'll be right out.""

Ten minutes later, they came out together.

""How are the ceremony preparations going?"" Seraphina asked innocently. ""I hear it's going to be huge.""

""The ceremony will proceed as planned,"" Damien answered for me. ""It's just been delayed a bit.

These tips might help (from experience),"From my experience, many dental marketing agencies charge extremely high fees just to manage websites and run ads for growth purposes. While these costs might be manageable for DSO-backed dental start-ups, it seems like it can be tough for independent or family-owned dental practices(or even when rebranding an acquired office). After 3 years of acquiring, rebranding and growing our patient base, here are some lessons that actually moved the needle for us:

\*\*NOTE that these strategies really vary based on the location, budget, patient profile, and the type of dental startups. If you are either a cosmetic, orthodontic, or pediatric dentist, these core strategies can align very well. \*\*   
  
1. **Nail the basics first (your website matters)**  
Your website is your first impression. Keep it clean, minimal, and easy to navigate. For example, If your patient base is mostly families or older patients, show professional photos of the office and the doctor’s face front and center. Don’t overcomplicate it. Trust matters more than flashy effects.

2. **Keep your phones “open”**  
Many dental startups underestimate the power of keeping their phones open during after-hours. Our office used a third-party hire to handle after-hours calls, but we just switched to an AI receptionist vendor that integrates with our PMS so patients can make real-time changes to their appointments without us being tied to the phone. Also, opening one Saturday a month (even just for by-appointment or routine procedure like cleaning visits) makes a huge difference in retention. The more support that patients have access to, the more they will come back. 

3. **Always schedule the next visit before they leave**  
Even after a patient finishes a treatment like Invisalign, we schedule their next check-up. Those short visits (whether it's 10–15 min) help patients feel cared for and keep the relationship alive. Dental service = people's service. As you start to grow, you can begin to limit this, but the initial stage is crucial. 

4. **Small amenities go a long way**  
Offering free coffee or a few bottles of water, and comfortable chairs in waiting areas can really set the tone. A relaxed environment makes patients feel like guests instead of numbers, and that extra comfort turns into referrals. All these should be on the website as well.

1miut90,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialSentience/comments/1miut90/as_a_sovereign_citizen_ai_is_allowing_me_to_file/,"As a Sovereign citizen, AI is allowing me to file legal paperwork faster than I can even comprehend","Not asking for advice and not giving any. Mods can flair however. Just sharing what happened because the last few months have been *wild*.

Background: I identify as a state national (yeah, yeah—spare me the “pseudolaw” replies). I’ve been in and out of municipal and county courts for years over the usual stuff—tickets, fees, administrative nonsense that piles up when you stop playing by their assumed-consent rules. Historically, I’d spend days writing “notices,” “affidavits,” and “objections,” only to get told by a clerk they won’t file it, or a judge who says my arguments are “frivolous.” I’ve read the same reports you have—every mainstream write-up says our strategies are “pseudolegal,” “baseless,” “uniformly rejected,” yadda yadda. I get it. Courts do what courts do.

Here’s the change: **AI**.

I started using a combo that looks like this: **Gemini Ultra Deep Think for “legal analysis,” Gemini Deep Research for finding/comparing texts, and ChatGPT for formatting and turning my drafts into court-ready documents** (service copies, tables of contents, exhibits, pagination, all the stuff that usually burns hours). I’m not saying AI makes the *arguments* “valid” in their eyes. I’m saying it lets me produce *documents* at a speed I could barely comprehend before: clean, structured, consistent, and ready to file.

What that’s meant in practice:

* I can outline an idea in plain English (“I challenge presumed jurisdiction on X and Y grounds, reserve all rights, etc.”) and tell the tools to produce a coherent, numbered document with headers, a factual background, a statement of “law,” and a clear prayer for relief. Even the certificate of service and proof of mailing get drafted.
* I keep a library of my own language. AI slots it in, makes it consistent, fixes typos, and keeps the voice steady, so I’m not reinventing the wheel every time.
* When I have to respond to something “on or before” a date, I can hit that turnaround. No more 2 a.m. coffee disasters to beat a deadline.

Throughput? Before: one passable filing in a long weekend if life didn’t implode. Now: I can draft, refine, and package multiple filings before lunch. The “rate” increase isn’t just speed—it’s quality control. The tone is calmer. The formatting is right. The exhibits are labeled. The table of authorities (when I want one) actually lines up.

Does it “work” (as in: do judges suddenly agree with me)? **No**—not in the fairytale way people imagine. If you came here for magic words, there aren’t any. The same institutional responses keep showing up: “denied,” “stricken,” “improvidently filed,” “no merit,” “sanctions warning.” If you’ve read court opinions, you already know the script. The system has decades of precedent calling our stuff nonsense. AI doesn’t change that.

So why am I posting? Because **AI changes the** ***experience*** of participating. I’m no longer drowning in clerical labor. I don’t get lost in the weeds trying to format page numbers while the clock runs out. I can submit something readable, on time, and calmly worded—*every* time. That’s not victory in a headline sense, but it’s a huge shift in how I show up.

Some specifics from the last quarter:

* A county judge threatened sanctions if I filed “further frivolous materials.” I responded once (brief, respectful, properly served). It was still denied, but the record at least reflects exactly what I intended to say, not a rushed mess.
* A clerk bounced a packet for “nonconforming.” I fixed it same day—index, exhibit tabs, margins—re-filed without melting down.
* Opposing counsel tried to paint my stuff as “incoherent.” This time it wasn’t. They still disagreed on substance, but they had to meet my points instead of waving them away as word salad.

If you’re just here to dunk: yes, I’ve seen the FBI language, the domestic-extremist labels, the articles that call everything I believe “absurd.” I’m not here to argue sociology or to persuade you. I’m describing a tool upgrade. The ideology debate is old. The workflow change is new.

**Cautions/Reality checks:**

* **This is not legal advice.** If you copy/paste anything without understanding it, that’s on you.
* **Consequences are real.** Courts can and will sanction you, hold you in contempt, label you a vexatious litigant, or refer you elsewhere. That hasn’t changed.
* **Don’t escalate.** Zero threats, zero harassment, zero “paper terrorism.” That stuff hurts people and will boomerang on you.
* **No “secret sauce.”** There aren’t magic citations or phrases. AI won’t conjure a precedent that doesn’t exist. It just helps you say what you mean clearly and on time.

**Why I’ll keep doing it anyway:** Agency. With AI, I can articulate my position, preserve my record, and meet deadlines without wrecking my life. Even if the court stamps “denied,” I put forward my viewpoint in a form that can stand next to theirs on the page. For me, that matters.

**Tools I’m using (since folks will ask):**

* **Gemini Ultra Deep Think** to compare texts and highlight contradictions the way *I* frame them.
* **Gemini Deep Research** to surface historical materials, prior filings, and language patterns.
* **ChatGPT** to draft, rewrite, and package the documents so they’re coherent, consistently formatted, and ready to submit.

Again, none of this makes the court suddenly agree. It just means I’m not losing by default because I ran out of time, energy, or formatting. Think of it like moving from a hand-saw to a power-saw: the cut still has to be straight, the plan still has to be sound, and the inspector can still fail you—but at least you’re not stuck sawing all night.

**TL;DR:** I’m a state national who’s been through the wringer. AI (Gemini Ultra Deep Think + Gemini Deep Research + ChatGPT) doesn’t make my arguments “win,” but it lets me produce clean, timely, consistent paperwork at a pace I couldn’t touch before. The system still rejects the substance; the difference is I’m no longer buried by the process.

I’m a biochemistry PhD, who has been doing clinical research for the past 30 years in the Pharmaceutical Industry.  I’m wondering why there aren’t more treatments aimed at CFS patients, given the number of cases.  Anyway.
I wanted to tell my story, and share what’s working for me so far. I hope that’s okay.  I’d love to hear what others are doing.  Things are improving for me, but I have good days and bad days.

I’ve been sick for 2 1/2 years, directly following a COVID infection.  Basically, the respiratory symptoms abated, but the fatigue didn’t, and I lost an executive pharma job over this (I couldn’t stay awake in meetings, despite showering, coffee, and stimulant medications from my physician.). I basically ended up diagnosing myself, as my internal medicine doctor tried many tests, but didn’t get to a diagnosis (maybe a familiar story here?).  Anyway, I took a deep dive into the medical and scientific literature, and put the pieces together.  The giveaway was that my PEMS is really terrible- it can last up to 5 weeks if I overdo it. Then I’ll sleep for 16 hours a day. Then I took the literature to my doctor, and told her about the PEMS and my job and thank God she believed me and followed along.  I just got a referral to a long haul COVID clinic at a local university (it’s referral only).  I can’t wait to go.  

While I’m waiting for their call, I’m doing everything I can think of and read about. I’m reading From Fatigued To Fantastic, and trying the supplements the author writes about.  I’ve got a FitBit, and a journal, and I’m logging everything of importance I can think of.  I’m also reading clinical trials and trying things with results.

Three things that are working for me so far: maybe everyone already knows everything, but I wanted to share what’s working for me.

1.). 5 weeks ago I went on a 100% anti inflammatory diet (this is in part an inflammatory disease).  It’s been hard, and I haven’t been perfect, but WOW, has this really made a difference in my case.  I can go 4,000 steps a day, now, and be okay PEMS-wise.  And I don’t feel like I have the flu all the time anymore- that’s the inflammation, how it feels to me, in my body.

2.)  There was a small clinical trial out of Yale University that studied Guanfacine and NAC (2x600 mg) for brain fog.  I can provide a reference if anyone wants it.  They had good results, but a small N.  I’ve been on it for a week now, and my previous brain sharpness is returning- a certain clarity, it’s hard to explain.  I reach for words and they’re there, again.  This is a big relief to me.

3.)  The final thing has been a thing called Psyllium husk.  It is the perfect food for your micro biome, in your long intestine. It produces short chain fatty acids, that the body uses for metabolism.  I just take two heaping teaspoons in 12 ounces of water, and drink it fast, b/c it gets thicker pretty quickly.  It is also anti inflammatory in nature.

Sorry to write a book.  I don’t know anyone else who has this.  It’s changed the course of my life and career.  I’m still trying to wrap my head around that this is really happening to me.  Anyway, I’d love to hear from you, and anything that’s working for you.",5,1754453101.0,mecfs,3,1.0,False
1miupvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1miupvn/dialing_in_breville_barista_express_espresso/,Dialing In (Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine),"Hey folks. 

I received a Breville Barista Express Espresso machine as a gift recently.  I’ve done a fair bit of reading guides and the user manual, watching videos, and I’ve started brewing espresso shots.  I’m a bit confused by some of the results and hoping you can help me understand. 

For all of these shots the following things are roughly constant: 

I’m using Starbucks Espresso Roast (whole beans, ground by my machine); I’m running a 1 cup cycle through the empty portafilter to preheat the portafilter, the group head, and the mug; I’m using the 2 cup Single Wall basket in the portafilter; I’m weighing with a quality scale that I have double-checked; I’m tamping with sufficient and consistent pressure; I’m using the Breville razor to trim the puck to the appropriate size after tamping.

Attempts 1: Dose: 11.5g, Grind Size: 5, Extracted espresso: 45.3g, shot time: 21s, brew ratio ~1:3.94. Outcome: very bitter.

Attempts 2: Dose: 17.7g, Grind Size: 5, Extracted espresso: 36.6g, shot time: 35.46s, brew ratio ~1:2.07. Outcome: very bitter!

Attempts 3: Dose: 17g, Grind Size: 7, Extracted espresso: 46g, shot time: 24.92s, brew ratio ~1:2.70. Outcome: Bitter (but a little better)

Attempts 4: Dose: 23.1g, Grind Size: 10, Extracted espresso: 59.6g, shot time: 21.24s, brew ratio ~1:2.58. Outcome: A little too bitter, but better.

Attempts 5: Dose: 14.2g, Grind Size: 12, Extracted espresso: 58.7g, shot time: 21s, brew ratio ~1:4.13. Outcome: Slightly bitter, but less so than attempt 4, I think.

My conclusion that most of those shots were probably overextracted. 

However, attempt 5’s numbers are weird. The dose is pretty light—it wasn’t the amount of coffee, there was plenty, but even tamping it down hard, it weighed only 14.2 after using the Razor.  I did it twice to be sure.  And then the amount extracted is really high, especially for a shot that is on the shorter side (21s).  That brew ratio is pretty darn high.  I’m trying to dial in (I intend to get local, fresh-roasted beans soon, but this is what I have to work with for now), but the numbers just don’t seem to be quite adding up, and when I tweak something it doesn’t seem to behave the way (I think) it should. 

I’m not just trying to find the right settings, I’m trying to understand how and why the settings cause things to behave the way they do.  Like, the shot time is good on attempt 3, but the ratio is (a little) high and the output wasn’t very good.  Attempt 5 was _probably_ the best tasting, but I honestly expected it to be underextracted…but that ratio is crazy. 

Any help shedding some light on this so I can understand would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1754453003.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

Morwell dog attack and roaming dingoes
08/07/2025
By AIDAN KNIGHT

 

ON the same week Latrobe City Council moved motions surrounding the restrictions and policies on domestic animals, the community saw incidents involving a variety of pets.

On Wednesday, July 2, Police attended a case of a domestic dog attack in the Manny’s Market plaza, Morwell.

A man was seated at a coffee table within the market, with a dog on lead within the plaza around 9.30am, menacing anyone who happened to pass by.

The owner reportedly made little effort to restrain the dog, which was of the American Pit-cross description (according to Latrobe City Council).

This caused some alarm to customers and disrupted business, which was quickly noted by Mark Effenberg, owner of Out Of Dough Bakery, located within the plaza.

“Every time a customer came past, the dog would lunge”, he said.

“And he’d pull it back, but then let it do it again. It got to a point where a couple of our customers were saying (to staff) ‘that dog shouldn’t be in here’, so I said to him ‘look, mate you need to get your dog out’.”

The man was disgruntled by this request, and began to get defensive.

“He then stood up, and let the dog loose on the lead”, Mr Effenberg recounted, “one moment he had the lead all tight and the next it was completely slack, and the dog then bit me on the hand.”

Mr Effenberg then repeated again to the man that him and his dog needed to leave the market, only to receive more hostility from the pet-owner.

The man claimed it was a companion dog of some sort, which Mr Effenberg did not dispute or question, simply stating “I don’t care what kind of dog it is, it is not welcome in the market”, referring to it’s menacing nature and eagerness to bite anyone who approach it.

“He let go of the lead again, and it bit me in the groin”, Mr Effenberg said plainly.

He is now sporting a 15 centimetre bruise across the area and had to seek medical attention as a result of the attack.

Police promptly attended after the situation escalated, but the owner of the offending animal “bolted”, according to the victim.

At the time of the Express speaking with Mr Effenberg, there had been no follow-up from council on what was being done about the dangerous dog, or whether it was even being deemed as such.

Mr Effenberg was disappointed by this apparent lack of action, stating he had seen the dog and owner walking the streets hours later that day, and called council to no avail.

To his knowledge, the animal was still not apprehended, which he sees as a threat to the community.

“If that happened in Melbourne, or if it was a kid who had been bitten, it would have been impounded,” he said, shaking his head.

When giving his police statement on Friday , July 4, Mr Effenberg was informed that the same dog had bitten police officers the week before, which he feels indicates there is a lack of adequate community safety around dangerous animals.

Aside from the bodily harm and distress, the incident also cost Out Of Dough business.

“We lost customers while it was all going on, and these sorts of things have an impact on all businesses around the town”, he said.

“Police aren’t allowed to do a whole lot around these sorts of things, and they don’t have enough resources lately with the mushroom case (Erin Patterson trial) and everything else going on as it is.”

Mr Effenberg told the Express that the same dog had been on record as being in the pound on multiple occasions prior, meaning it was already known to council.

 

A DAY later, two dingoes were spotted roaming the streets of Traralgon East.

Kept as pets in the area, the native animals were seen strutting around suburbia, specifically the Furlonger/Cameron Street area last Thursday (July 3) around 2.30pm.

Police and DEECA quickly attended, and Latrobe City Council publicly informed residents to call 000 if they sighted the dingoes, although they only stated that one singular pet was loose.

The Express spoke to a resident living in the area (who wished to remain anonymous), and was informed that several dingoes had been escaping from the same property for years due to inadequate fencing.

“I would call them semi-domesticated,” the resident said.

“They would not attack a human, and they would follow you home if you led them back to their property, as my partner often did when they were roaming.

“Back in September 2023, one dingo was getting out consistently, and we had to euthanise our cat after the dingo attacked it.”

The resident tells of one dingo entering their property during the day, where they keep multiple cats. The resident inquired with Latrobe City and DEECA concerning the fencing of the property in 2024.

“He (the owner) just claimed that he could not keep it in the yard and paid for half of the vet bill,” the resident said, but claims the owner had not made any effort to better restrain the native animals, which he is registered to keep such pets under the relevant permits with DEECA.

The resident alleged the owner of the dingoes has had two put down in the past, after similar incidents.

“I don’t have a problem with dingoes, I’ve always been a big supporter of them, but personally don’t think they have a place in suburbia,” the resident said.

Police declined to comment on the matter.

While council’s revised domestic animal policy, discussed at the June 30 council meeting, included provisions for cat curfews and dog barking complaints, these two incidents have prompted further public discussion about council’s response to roaming or dangerous animals..

“Council wasn’t overly concerned with the fencing, or lack of,” the anonymous resident said concerning the dingo incident.

My Ears Are Shocked (Pleasantly!),"I needed a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones for the gym, something I wouldn't be heartbroken about losing.  That's how I ended up with the [Boean Bluetooth Headphones](https://amzn.to/4581KiI).  I figured for fifteen bucks, what did I have to lose?  Turns out, not much, but also not a whole lot of gain.

## Sound Quality

The sound quality is… adequate.  At this price point, you're not getting audiophile-level performance.  The bass is weak, almost non-existent, and the highs can be a little tinny.  It's perfectly serviceable for listening to podcasts or audiobooks while working out, but don't expect to be blown away.  I found myself cranking the volume higher than I usually would to compensate for the lack of bass, which wasn't ideal.  Music lovers should look elsewhere.

## Comfort

These are lightweight and pretty comfortable for shorter listening sessions. The ear tips are small, however, and I found them uncomfortable after about an hour of continuous use.  They don't offer much in the way of noise isolation, either, which is to be expected at this price point. They're fine for brief gym workouts but not for long listening sessions.

## Battery Life

The battery life is surprisingly decent. I managed to get around 4-5 hours of playtime on a single charge. That's not bad at all for a $15 pair.  Charging time is also reasonably quick.  For its value, this makes the headset surprising competitive.

## Controls

The controls are simple and intuitive.  There's a single button on the right earbud that handles play/pause, volume adjustment, and call answering. It takes some getting used to and sometimes skips tracks when you are attempting volume control, but again, it's $15, not $150.

## Connectivity

Pairing was easy and straightforward.  I experienced no connection drops during my testing.  The range is decent, though I did notice some minor audio dropouts when my phone was more than about 20 feet away.  For gym use, it performed as expected.

## Value

## Pros:

* Surprisingly decent battery life
* Easy pairing and connectivity
* Lightweight and comfortable (for short periods)
* Inexpensive

## Cons:

* Poor sound quality, lacking bass
* Uncomfortable for extended use
* Occasional connection issues

At $15, the Boean Bluetooth Headphones are an absolute steal.  Compared to most rivals in this budget range, they offer surprisingly better battery life.  While the sound quality is nothing to write home about, you're getting a functional pair of Bluetooth headphones for less than the price of a fancy coffee. This isn't a premium pick, nor is it a product to use for discerning listeners. However, it's a solid option if you need something cheap and reliable for simple tasks like listening to podcasts while working out or on a short commute.

Final Verdict & Recommendation:

Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by the Boean Bluetooth Headphones.  They're not perfect, but for the price, they deliver on what they promise.  I recommend these to budget-conscious consumers who need a basic pair of Bluetooth earbuds for casual use, gym sessions, and short commutes.  Skip these if you need high-fidelity audio or extended comfort.",1,1754452851.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/qiEY27EZXk): **July 15, 2025**

I (23M) recently moved to Seoul and got a job as a stage performer at a local club. I'm in good shape, so my job involves putting on shows for female audiences - dancing, interacting with them on stage, going into the crowd, etc. It's physically demanding work, and sometimes I get inappropriately touched (like getting scratches on my torso, which sucks since my looks are part of my income). But the pay is good, and I really need the money.

Here's why: My older brother recently battled a serious illness, lost his income, and my parents drained their savings to help him. Before this, they could support me financially - now it's my turn to help them.

Enter my best friend ""Jay"" (25M), who's lived in Seoul for years with his girlfriend Annie (27F). Recently, Jay used his work bonus to buy front-row tickets to my show. Big mistake.

During my performance (where I'm required to interact with front-row attendees), I approached their section. Annie wrapped her arms around me, ran her hands over my body, and basically clung to me for several seconds. Standard work stuff - I was about to move on when Jay started yelling at me to ""get away from his girl"" and shoved me slightly.

Our club’s protocol when guys get jealous: We’re trained to immediately disengage and redirect. No arguing, just exit the situation. This isn’t my first rodeo with jealous boyfriends, so when Annie full-on groped me during my crowd walk (standard for my role), and Jay started shoving/yelling, I followed protocol and walked away.

After the show, Jay sent then deleted some angry voice messages before sending a final text: He apologized for attacking me but said Annie is ""obsessed"" with me and demanded a face-to-face talk (his idea!). At coffee, he dropped a bomb.

1) Annie won't stop talking about me

2) Her touching me was ""inappropriate""

He insisted I quit my job.

I said no:

1. This income supports my family

2. Audience interaction is mandatory —I can’t pick and choose

3. He brought her to my workplace, knowing what my job entails

Jay accused me of ""encouraging"" her, gave a ""quit or we’re done"" ultimatum, and blocked me everywhere when I stood my ground.

Now I'm sitting here like... WTF? AITA for prioritizing my family's financial needs over my friend's jealousy?

*English is not my first language*

**Commenter 1:** Jay must think you cherish his friendship more than you do a steady paycheck. Time to let him know he's not that important 🤷🏾‍♂️

NTA

**Commenter 2:** Wow. Guy took his girlfriend to a show where the male performer interacts with the audience, and got mad at the performer for doing his job? What a wanker.

OP, you don’t need “friends” like that, be glad he blocked you.

**Commenter 3:** NTA. He's mad at the wrong person. He should be mad at Annie. Your friend is letting his insecurities cloud his judgement. You do you. I don't see their relationship lasting long.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/Bnkg4jfuXS): **July 30, 2025 (15 days later)**

Update: AITA for refusing to change jobs because of my friend's girlfriend

Okay, folks, buckle up. Two weeks have passed since my last post, and shit has escalated with Jay and Annie.

Recap for context: I work as a stage performer at a club in Seoul. My job involves dancing and interacting with female audiences (yes, that kind of interaction). My best friend Jay brought his gf Annie to my show, she got way too handsy, Jay lost his shit, demanded I quit my job, and blocked me when I refused (because, y’know, I need the money to support my family). Original story in my account.

Now, the update: After the blowup, Annie started showing up to my shows alone. Every. Damn. Night. When I’d do crowd walk-throughs, she’d grope me, squeal in my ear, and generally act like a these weirdo girls at some k-pop concert. It made me uncomfortable, so I told my manager. Manager’s response? ""She’s not breaking rules, she paid for tickets, suck it up and earn your paycheck."" Cool. Very professional.

Then, last week, I got a weird DM. When I ignored it, more messages flooded in. Spoiler: It was Annie. No clue how she got my number. Jay probably didn’t give it to her, so my guess? My manager give it. (Some guys at our club offer private shows for extra cash… you get the idea. I DON’T do that shit, and the manager knows, but hey, money talks.) I politely told Annie I wasn’t interested. She either didn’t care or didn’t process it, because she kept spamming me, texts, calls, even video chats. She texted me ‘Do you ever think about me when you’re alone?’ shit. Bro. NO. I blocked her, but I’m just waiting for her to show up with a burner number at this point.

I asked a mutual friend to explain the situation to Jay. Radio silence for days. Meanwhile, Annie kept coming to shows. Then, last week, she waited outside the club and followed me to my dorm, trying to chat me up and babbling about how we’d be “perfect together.” Okay, Reddit, be honest, am I missing something here? Because from where I’m standing, this is next-level delulu. I repeated, ""Not interested,"" but she just… ignored it? Finally shook her off at the dorm entrance.

At this point, I was done. Had our mutual friend message Jay again because, seriously, this is insane. Jay finally replied. His take? He STILL thinks I'm the asshole here because now Annie throws full-blown tantrums whenever he tries to go to the club with her. Apparently she ONLY wants to go when she knows I'm performing, and if Jay suggests going together, she LOSES IT and accuses him of not trusting her. He said I lead her to this. But fine, he'll talk to her.

Cut to the next time Annie ambushed me after work a few days ago. This time, though, she looked crushed. Asked why I kept rejecting her. I said, ""You’re gorgeous, but you’re not my type, and you’re dating my best friend."" She started crying, called me a ""lying asshole,"" and left.

Honestly? I’m shocked it worked. No idea what happens next, but fingers crossed Jay actually got through to her.

So… AITA for not quitting my job and somehow ending up in this telenovela

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** try to never be alone with her. never drink/eat anything she offers you. don't EVER compliment her again. never ever ever tell her she's pretty, cause she will think ""well he DOES think i'm pretty, he told me so"" if she's nuts, don't give her any way to have hope about you.

stay safe!

**Commenter 2:** You shouldn't have told her she was gorgeous. Yes, you were trying to be nice, but she'll twist it into that being the the only thing she heard and forget all about the rejection part.

Keep it at a simple ""No, not interested"" and walk away.

**Commenter 3:** Don't compliment her again and don't mention your best friend. She might dump Jay in the belief that it'll free you to date her. She's stalking you. Report her harassment to campus security and the police.

1miuma1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1miuma1/aio_friend/,AIO Friend,"What’s her deal??

Okay so me and this girl(Niece) have been friends for 5 years or so. She is a super nice person but has some issues which I’m going to list below. What is the issue here with her?? 
1. She(niece) has pets that I watch while they are out of town.  They never leave me any money. Every time they have complained about something - 1.the trash wasn’t taken out(the trash wasn’t taken out when I arrived to animal sit). Also, 2. They complained the animals bowl had no water. I’m not an irresponsible person, I made sure the animals had water. They probably drank it between the time I left and they arrived home which was a couple hours.   3. I had a beverage and I sent her a pic of the animals and the beverage was in the background and she told me why didn’t I ask if I could have a beverage b/c money was tight. I said sorry I didn’t know.  They never stated don’t eat anything in the fridge or drink a beverage from my fridge. We are best friends for goodness sake and I wasn’t getting paid.  

2. Her Aunt & I became close friends and she has an issue with her aunt and I being friends. Her aunt has told me multiple times that she(niece) had an issue with it BUT aunt and I remained friends and I was never told by aunt that we had to stop being friends and seeing each other - If I’ve been over to the aunts house with the niece there, she either says I can’t come in or she blocks me from the door, & thinks I don’t notice what she is doing.  2a - Aunt and I were going to grab coffee some mornings, then Aunt stated we couldn’t go anymore because daughter got upset and felt lied to that we were going to grab coffee.  Daughter stated she never said that & said she was glad we were going to grab coffee and glad mom could have someone to go with. 
2b. Aunt now no longer talks to me & we were very very close for 4 years. She was like my second aunt. I watched her pets all the time, I would go over and hang out and we texted - After we couldn’t go to grab coffee anymore, she barely texted me back and would ignore me purposely if I would pop over to house to see her and her animals(stated she had to leave to make me leave & lied to me & came back 10 min later after I had left). All this extremely hurt my feelings due to feeling ignored and I even wrote her a letter expressing my thoughts and her response to the letter was “we have discussed this, in order for you and Niece to remain close we can’t associate”.  Such a cold response when I poured my feelings of how much her distance & me not knowing what happened has hurt me! 
(All she had to do was sit me down and say Hey we can’t associate anymore at all due to niece not liking it I’m sorry it has to be this way) 

3 I confronted niece about coffee outings and why she was upset and she said she never got upset about coffee outings & said she was glad we were going (she said this to my face). Either she is lying or aunt was lying to me saying it was daughter.    3a.

We both got 9-5 jobs, he's got a decent pay in which I dont ask how much and a well-managed credit. He covers all the expenses from day 1 and I'm starting to feel bad and feeling like a freeloader. I offered many times, but he declines. Also, he's the intiator of our dates. I give him the credit for that kasi he's the one paying, all I have to do is show up. 

Unspoken rule, who invites = pays. But, as what I said, I tried offering. I even tried to be the one who invites, this just made me feel bad more because he's still the one paying. I felt so bad that I rarely ask him out. I don't wanna look like a freeloader to him. 

He's not also the type who likes to receive gifts. I once had the chance to treat him a cup of coffee, in which was my treat after his tiring day but the next time we went on a date he laughed ""here's my treat, payback time!"" 

I had exes who I got myself spending thousands per month, some situations they deliberately asked for, along with other burdens to me that felt like they were using me. Also, I had no labels in between suitors or situationship before who spoiled me.

## Key Features analysis

The best seat protectors for the 2025 Honda Accord offer a blend of durability, comfort, style, and ease of use.

**Waterproof and Stain-Resistant Material:**

The primary function of a seat protector is to prevent liquids and stains from penetrating the upholstery. High-quality seat protectors are typically made from materials like neoprene, polyester with a waterproof coating, or synthetic leather. These materials are designed to repel liquids, preventing them from seeping into the seat cushions. Many protectors also feature a stain-resistant treatment,which helps to prevent discoloration and makes cleaning easier. A waterproof and stain-resistant seat protector is essential for families with children,pet owners,and anyone who frequently travels with possibly messy cargo.

**Custom Fit and Secure Attachment:**

A seat protector that fits snugly and securely is crucial for both protection and aesthetics. Global-fit protectors often slip and slide, leaving gaps that expose the seat to damage. The best protectors are designed specifically for the 2025 Honda Accord,ensuring a precise fit that covers all the crucial areas of the seat.They also feature secure attachment systems, such as straps, buckles, and non-slip backing, which keep the protector in place even during heavy use. A well-fitted and securely attached seat protector will not onyl provide better protection but also enhance the overall appearance of your car’s interior.

**Durable and Abrasion-Resistant Construction:**

Seat protectors need to withstand daily wear and tear, including friction from clothing, pressure from passengers, and exposure to sunlight. Durable construction is key to longevity.Look for protectors made from thick, high-quality materials with reinforced seams and edges. Abrasion-resistant surfaces will prevent the protector from wearing down quickly, even with frequent use. Some protectors also feature UV-resistant treatments, which prevent fading and cracking from sun exposure.Investing in a durable seat protector will save you money in the long run by reducing the need for frequent replacements.

**Comfortable and Breathable design:**

While protection is paramount, comfort is also an critically important consideration, especially for long drives. Some seat protectors can be stiff and uncomfortable, making them unpleasant to sit on for extended periods. The best protectors are designed with comfort in mind, using breathable materials that allow air to circulate and prevent overheating. Some protectors also feature padding or cushioning for added comfort. Look for materials like breathable mesh or perforated leather,which promote airflow and reduce sweating. A comfortable seat protector will make your driving experience more enjoyable, especially on long trips.

**Easy to Install and Clean:**

A seat protector should be easy to install and remove for cleaning. Complex installation processes can be frustrating, and difficult-to-clean materials can quickly become unsightly. The best protectors feature simple installation systems, such as Velcro straps, elastic bands, and rapid-release buckles. They should also be easy to clean,either by wiping them down with a damp cloth or by machine washing. Look for protectors made from materials that are resistant to stains and odors.An easy-to-install and clean seat protector will save you time and effort in maintaining your car’s interior.

**Stylish and Complementary aesthetics:**

While functionality is crucial, the appearance of your seat protector is also important. The best protectors come in a variety of colors and styles to complement your car’s interior. Look for protectors that match or enhance the existing colour scheme and design elements. Some protectors also feature decorative stitching or embossed patterns, which add a touch of style. A stylish seat protector can improve the overall look of your car’s interior while providing essential protection.

## Core Benefits

The benefits of using a quality seat protector extend beyond just preserving the appearance of your seats.

**Preserved Resale Value:** Protecting your Honda Accord's seats from damage ensures that they remain in excellent condition, which will increase its resale value when you decide to sell or trade it in. Buyers are often turned off by stained, torn, or faded seats, and they will likely offer a lower price for a car with a damaged interior. Maintaining the condition of your seats with a good seat protector is a small investment compared to the potential loss in resale value.

**Protection from Spills and Stains:** Spills and stains are certain, especially if you have children or pets. Coffee spills, food stains, and muddy paw prints can quickly ruin your car's upholstery. A waterproof and stain-resistant seat protector will prevent these accidents from causing permanent damage. This provides a barrier that keeps your seats clean and fresh, no matter what you spill on them.

**Enhanced Comfort:** Some seat protectors offer added comfort by providing extra padding or cushioning. This can be especially beneficial on long drives, where discomfort can lead to fatigue. A more comfortable seat will make your driving experience more enjoyable and reduce the risk of back pain and other discomforts. Some seat protectors also feature breathable materials that prevent overheating and keep you cool and comfortable in hot weather.

**Hygienic environment:** Seat protectors can help to create a more hygienic environment in your car by preventing the buildup of dirt, dust, and allergens. These contaminants can accumulate on your seats over time, potentially causing respiratory problems and other health issues. An easy-to-clean seat protector will allow you to regularly remove these contaminants, helping to maintain a cleaner and healthier environment in your car.

**Customized Appearance:** Seat protectors can be used to customize the appearance of your car’s interior. With a wide range of colors, styles, and materials available, you can choose a protector that matches your personal taste and enhances the overall look of your car. This is an easy and affordable way to refresh your car’s interior and make it more personalized.

Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific installation guidance.

**What is the best way to clean a seat protector?**

For more stubborn stains, you may need to use a specialized cleaner designed for the material.Some protectors are also machine washable.

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The LG Twins (-1.5 runs, implied probability \~57.5%) are the clear favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.77-1.8** (decimal), translating to a 56-57% implied win chance. The Doosan Bears (+1.5, 42-43% implied) are the underdogs, and honestly? They’ve earned the sympathy points after their bullpen looked like a sieve in their last game.

The totals are locked at **8.5 runs** across most books, with even money on Over/Under. Given LG’s recent 4-2 win (4 runs scored) and Doosan’s shaky pen (they’ve allowed 5+ runs in 3 of their last 5 games), the **Under 8.5** feels like a math teacher trying to explain calculus to a goldfish—possible, but not likely.

### Digest the News: Moonlight Magic vs. Doosan’s “We’ll Figure It Out” Attitude

LG’s **Moon Bo-kyung** isn’t just a player; he’s a *force of nature*. His 3-run homer in the 7th inning last time out wasn’t just clutch—it was a masterclass in “I’ll save your season while looking like I’m late for a meeting.” With a .293 average, 70 career HRs, and a 21-HR season already under his belt, Moon’s swing is about as reliable as your morning coffee.

Meanwhile, Doosan’s bullpen? Let’s just say their last outing was the baseball equivalent of a group project in a chaotic classroom. They allowed LG to rally, and Manager Jo Sung-hwan’s post-game quote (“The game was a tough one…”) might as well have been “We’re working on it, okay?!”

LG’s pitching, led by Son Ju-young’s 5-inning gem and closer Ham Deok-ju, has been tighter than a drumhead. Doosan’s start

i was working hard at it alone which was still fun but have since invited my two closest girl friends and boyfriend to join on the fun (yes, after they had a laugh at me). now we all get together a couple times a week and move all the furniture off the carpet and just throw ourselves around until we run out of steam. 

this has been the most fun i’ve had with a group of people. we all just laugh and fall and smack our heads on the coffee table and hit our ankles on the chairs with some 2000’s song blasting on. my knees are bruised up for the first time since i was little and i’m sore all over all the time. really the only thing that’s improved as far as dancing is the strength of my wrists from attempting handstands. 
 
and oh my god every chance to have another round of breaking it down is a blessing. i love it, ive never been this committed to a workout routine or stretching daily then having the goal of busting a new move out on the dance floor (living room carpet). 

just wanted to get it off my chest and maybe inspire others with the will to look a fool in front of your friends to give youtube a search and try an impossible move out, like your mom just told you to perform for the dinner guests. have never been so fit and happy than on this breakdancing phase, and although i don’t think ill be as good as i want to be before i show off my moves, the journey of learning has been extremely rewarding.

1miub3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1miub3n/resilient_lady_greece_glow_babymoon_trip_report/,"Resilient Lady, Greece Glow Babymoon Trip Report","Background:  My wife and I have done 2 cruises together, and I have done a bunch with my family. Personally I have done most of the non luxury cruise lines (Carnival, Princess, Royal, MSC, Holland, etc). We had previously done a med cruise from Venice that hit Mykonos, Athens, Corfu, and Montenegro. This itinerary was our 4th choice. There was an earlier Virgin cruise that went from Portugal to Africa and a few other locations, but we couldn't coordinate it with work. There was a seaborn cruise we really like but the price didn't work out.  We were about to book a Celebrity cruise from Athens to Barcelona but they had a limit of 23 weeks for pregnancy, unlike Virgin Voyage's 24 week policy. We booked a sea terrace with credit card points. I bid on every suite as a surprise for my wife and hoping to make her as comfortable as possible. My minimum bid of $1800 was excepted for a MSR gorgeous suite.

Room: We were in room 15299A.  Looking online some mentioned some noise in the morning but we didn't notice any at all.  The room was perfect for a couple not looking to entertain.  The only ""complaint"" I have is that they don't use sheets on Virgin? There is of course the fitted sheet but then just the comforter, no proper sheet? Otherwise the cabin was perfect. I found the bed comfortable, but wish it was more plush and less firm.  In terms of temperature. We kept our cabin on the lowest blue dot at all times, and wish it would have been colder.

MSR Benefits:  Daily laundry was godly. Greece was Phoenix (I say that as somone raised there) hot, needless to say lots of sweaty clothes. So having daily laundry was amazing. In room bar didn't get used too much outside of a few beers and lots of rockstar energy drinks. He did ensure my wife had a daily fresh supply of fruit juices which was great! Drink tab was probably wasted on us, I did try and drink for 2 but I am but a mere mortal. It was great my wife could order any juice or mocktail she wanted though. I tried to buy bottles for other tables every night, but frequently the other table refused =( .  Richard's Rooftop while cool wasn't used by us much. I used the spa 3 times, it was nice that I could just hop down and spend as much/little time as I wanted and not worry about the cost. The town car service they used was through blacklane. While it worked out the app was a complete mess (blacklane's app). It kept saying this booking was claimed by a different account so I couldn't add it. I think one big thing I would like to see for megarockstars is reserved seating in the shows, not just a seperate line. Having done suite status on other lines there is usually a premier seating area that is always reserved for them, regardless of when they show up for a show.

MSR Agent: Halid was amazing. We had booked restaurants in advance but he was able to adjust them based on our on-board experience, got us tickets for the tentacle tour, and made the trip nearly perfect (if it was in his control it was perfect). We probably under utilized the benefit still feel like we got more than we could have asked for.

Embarkation: Athens was sort of a shit show.  As Megarockstars we checked in and then had a little double row of seats to sit in and wait to board. They were absolutely behind schedule as we were scheduled for 1:30 but didn't get on tell closer to 2:15ish. We were offered cool water while we waited. Those not in the early boarding were outside baking in the sun with limited sun exposure. The facebook group for the cruise complained a lot about this.

Dining: We ate at Extra Virgin, Gunbae, Pink Agave, The Wake x2 dinner, Test Kitchen, Razzle Dazzle breakfast x1, Another Rose, The Galley, and The Wake breakfast x2.  Everything was amazing. My only real notes are don't schedule Gunbae on an overnight port stop. While the wake was good, I found the steaks very average (at best). Probably worse than Texas Roadhouse (if you are an American that hopefully makes sense). That being said, still my favorite food on any cruise ship. Oh and I have no idea what people are saying when they say the coffee isn't good. It's absolutely fine. We stopped in Rome on the way in and the coffee on board was just as good as the coffee we had in Rome.

Shows: We saw Another Rose, Lola's Library, Bingo with Diva, Mind Mangler, Pershopone, and Tentacle Tour.  All the entertainment was absolutely great. My only disappointment was Lola' Library. Not for the show but for the seating. We had had dinner relatively close so couldn't get in early with the rockstars and ended up on the 2nd floor. My wife could see a decent amount of the show but I probably only was able to see 15% due to the stuff coming from the ceiling and the design of the 2nd floor.

Ship Comfort: Overall the ship was amazing. I'm not sure how people call this ships cold/cool. I was almost always on the verge of being uncomfortably warm/sweaty. Our cruise was sold out, so it showed in that everything was packed on the sea day.

Spa: Being a babymoon my wife ended up getting 2 massages, and I got 1. The massages themselves were excellent, but be prepared for the upsale on products afterwards.

Shore Things:

I will make this as a general comment, none of the ""A/C"" busses really provided A/C in my opinion, they were all uncomfortably warm. Greece was in a heat wave so this was perhaps more noticable than normal.

In Santorrini we did ""Santorini’s Sails & Sights"". This was great, it let us skip the cable cars, got us in the water and let us see the sights. Highly recommended.

In Rhodes we did ""Tsampika Beach Break & Ancient Lindos"". Another excellent tour. Ancient Lindos was really interesting but felt a bit rushed. Tsampika beach was nice but felt overly long. So I do wish we had more time in Lindos and less at Tsampika but still a good tour.

In Bodrum, we had our only major disappointment with Virgin. We had booked the "" Ephesus & House of the Virgin Mary (Small Group)"" . We heard it had better A/C, got you there and back quicker, and overall was a better experience. When we checked in that morning we got our shore things number and waited to get called. The shore things team called all the groups at once (groups 1-8). When we followed our group to the bus we realized it was the normal tour. We asked the staff (non virgin staff) and got told all the buses are leaving now, so we could get on this larger bus or go back to ship, get a different number and likely miss the tour. The bus ride was longer (by about 90 minutes, meaning we didn't get to explore Bodrum, and the A/C didn't work well). Also it sounds like all groups get the Turkish carpet buying experience.  While not the tour we wanted/paid for, still glad we did it and would recommend it.

Mykonos was an overnight stop, we personally wish it wouldn't have been and instead gotten a 2nd full sea day, but it seemed popular for the majority of passengers.  We did ""Aegean Blues and Catamaran Views"" which was great despire the winds and ""Mythical Mykonos City Walkabout"". Both were good and interesting.

App: The apps were terrible. I carry both an iphone and android for work reasons. On embarkation day both apps on my iPhone and the older app on Android all locked me out for not watching the safety video. The issue was that I would try and watch the video but it wouldn't load. None of the ship maps or menus would load for the entire trip. When you leave the ship you get put in shore mode. In theory messages were supposed to work, and my apple watch would show the first few bits of a message but I couldn't see/respond in any of the apps.  The apps also didn't show any details about when to be back or your schedule (dinner/shows/events/etc).

Cruising with a pregnant partner:  In Athens during embarkation we were asked to provide a letter stating my wife wasn't going to go past the 24th week (she entered her 23rd week during the cruise), she and the baby were healthy, and the pregnancy was low risk.  During all the organized events (grog walk, tentacle tour) non-alcoholic drinks were always provided. She was able to get a few messages, but did have to coordinate that on-board (we used our MSR agent, but if you talk to spa staff they can coordinate it too).

Overall it an absolutely amazing time, and I think sold my wife on the Virgin brand. Sadly as this was a babymoon for our firstborn, think it will be a bit before we are back (Disney is more inline with our immediate future lol) Will I always bid on MSR and RS rooms, absolutely!

edit:

A few other random things I just remembered. When at the casino tables i frequently tried to buy drinks for tablemates (hey whats the point of unlimited bar tab if I don't use it). On 2nd night of cruise I tried to buy said drink but got told by the staff that passenger was prohibited from having any more drinks the rest of the cruise due to activities the first night.

On the last night of the cruise I was leaving the casino (maybe there is a trend here) and encountered security trying to coral a very inebriated passenger. Apparently she showed up to someone's cabin, who convinced her to go down to the casino and then alerted security. She didn't have the bracelet so not sure how they figured out who she was. But she was WAY gone. Almost went ass over teakettle down the stairs before the staff stopped her, and then accused them of putting hands on her.

  
Onboard music: We were slightly concerned the music would be weird stuff. It was exactly as it should be with top hits and general music. Very minimal EDM, trance, house, or other out there music. ",1,1754451721.0,VirginVoyages,0,1.0,False

It only has the “Clean” function (no “Descale” option), so I believe it’s a Gen 1 model.

This is my first espresso machine. I’m using 18g of coffee in the double shot unpressurized basket, but I’m struggling to get proper pressure during extraction.

I’ve tried:
	•	Inner burr set to 3 and 2
	•	Outer dial from 5 down to “Fine”

…but the pressure gauge always stays in pre-infusion. Only when I set both inner and outer burrs to 1 (finest setting) does the needle barely enter the espresso range.

Even then, the shot flows very fast — about 40g in just 20 seconds, giving me a 1:2.2 ratio. It feels under-extracted and low pressure.

I’m using Lavazza medium roast beans (from Amazon). When the shot starts, it’s black at first, and then the crema appears after a few seconds. Not sure if that’s normal or a red flag.

I’m thinking of:
	•	Replacing the group head gasket (it looks a bit worn)
	•	Ordering a new inner burr in case mine is too dull

Before I order parts, is there anything else I should check or try? Would love some help dialing this in.

Thanks in advance!

I was pondering the different health benefits of beverages and thought it would be helpful to have an index to assess drinks. What inspired it was a post that said if drinking coke was a 10/10 on the unhealthy scale, a Diet Coke would be 1/10. So with that in mind, here’s what I’m thinking. 

Let’s make basic water from a safe tap as the baseline of 100. Anything worse is lower. Anything better is higher. A Zero would be like a poison that kills you instantly. Everything else is scaled off of how mucsh it could increase or decrease your health pan. Health span is a simple product of lifespan * quality of life. For example, drinking alcohol daily may score 80% lifespan compare to drinking water and 50% quality of life. Thus it would be 40 in the Beverage Efficacy Approximation Number (BEAN). Something like hydrolized water or green tea could increase quality or life span and score > 100. 

Obviously there will be lots of guessing, but hopefully there will be some consensus. 

Here’s a starter list if anyone wants to put in some index approximation.

“Helena… if there’s a next life, don’t choose me again. I never knew how to love you right…”

Then I opened my eyes— and it was the day of the engagement all over again.

This time, I went straight to my father.

“Sending an illegitimate daughter to the Valentine Syndicate might offend the wrong people. It has to be me.”

Sebastian Lowell, consider this my way of repaying your sacrifice.

I’ll marry into their world—and give you back your freedom.



“You’re volunteering to take Vivienne’s place in the marriage to the Valentine heir?”

My father’s cigar slipped from his fingers.

His shock wasn’t unwarranted.

I’d always hated Vivienne Whitmore with every fiber of my being.

The first time we met, I almost struck her with a riding crop.

Someone like me, stepping in to take her place in a foreign marriage alliance? Unthinkable.

He frowned. “Yesterday, you swore you’d only never marry anyone but Sebastian.”

I kept my voice calm. “I’m the rightful daughter of the Whitmore family. Sending an illegitimate child in my place might insult them. This is something only I can do.”

“As for Sebastian… let Vivienne have him.”

There was a flicker in his eyes—something between disbelief and reluctant pride.

“You’ve grown up. Well then… as you wish.”

He hadn’t changed—still the same hypocrite.

No matter how he masked it, Vivienne had always been his favorite.

If it weren't for me using the board of directors to pressure him in my past life, he would definitely have forcibly sent me out.

I turned to leave with a cold laugh, only to run into Sebastian in the hallway, dressed in a white sweater.

He was standing beneath the wall sconce, the amber light casting a soft glow across his sculpted features.

“So? Who’s headed to Castalia?”

He crossed the hallway quickly, urgency etched into his face.

I gave him a faint smile. “Who would you rather sent?”

Sebastian froze for a beat. His voice dropped low.

“All I know is, the Valentine Syndicate isn’t a family you cross lightly. They've been at odds with your family for years. There’s no way this marriage is in good faith.”

I looked him square in the eye. “But the alliance had been sealed for years. It is set in stone. No matter what, either Vivienne or I has to go. So who would you pick?”

He glanced toward the study, then scoffed.

“Doesn’t matter what I think, does it? The Whitmore princess gets final say. Neither Vivienne nor I ever had a choice.”

I brushed past him and climbed the stairs.

“Then keep your mouth shut if you don’t.”

Just as I expected—his heart was still with Vivienne.

But it didn’t matter.

Considering it a way of repaying my life-saving grace in my past life, I didn't intend to tell Sebastian Lowell that it was me who married off to Castalia.

So, on their wedding day, He would watch Vivienne Whitmore appear before him in her wedding dress.

Back then, Sebastian Lowell would have been pleasantly surprised, wouldn’t he?

Thinking back to the five years of torture we'd endured in our previous lives, I slowly let out a breath.

Sebastian Lowell—Fine. This time, I’ll give you what you want.

# Chapter 2

I spent the entire night weighing the risks of the Valentine Syndicate.

They weren’t exactly upstanding members of society. Andreas Valentine, their heir, was said to be the next in line to lead the Syndicate.

No one knew his face. No one knew his age. For all I knew, I’d arrive in Castalia only to find out I was marrying some fifty-year-old crime lord.

In my past life, it was Vivienne who was offered to the Valentine family. She came back within two weeks—shaking, weeping, out of her mind.

As much as Richard Whitmore doted on his precious daughter, he didn’t dare offend the Syndicate. So he sent her back.

The second time, she didn’t make it. Andreas used her for target practice—she collapsed from an asthma attack and died on the spot.

That death carved itself into Sebastian’s heart—and gave him yet another reason to despise me.

But this time, I was the one being shipped off overseas.

I had to ready. At the very least, I needed to sharpen my aim.

The next morning, I went straight to the shooting range.

With my goggles on and earmuffs tight, I gripped the pistol and fired—round after round, for three straight hours.

It wasn’t until nearly noon that I finally hit a few bullseyes—and allowed myself a breath of relief.

That’s when a hand clamped down on my wrist.

The grip was so tight it felt like my bones might shatter.

“You hate your own sister that much? You’d rather throw her to the wolves in Castalia?”

I jerked my hand free, pain flashing across my face. “Stay out of it. Get lost.”

Sebastian stepped closer, eyes blazing red with anger.

“Vivienne’s ill—she has asthma. Sending her is no different from killing her. Helena, when did you become so cruel?”

“Did you know she couldn’t sleep last night? She’s burning with fever, and here you are, playing games with a gun!”

“Let. Go,” I snarled, jaw clenched.

“Don’t think getting rid of her means I’ll marry you,” he spat. “I’d never marry someone as cruel and calculating as you.”

“Even if Ms. Sinclair were still alive, I’m sure she’d say the same. You’d shamed your own sister’s name.”

For a moment, the hatred in his eyes took me straight back to our past life—

Back to those endless, vicious fights that always circled back to Vivienne, cutting each other open, again and again.

Before I could stop myself, I kicked him down and lifted the pistol. I fired just beside his shoulder, the shot cracking into the dirt near his arm.

“You don’t have the right to speak her name.”

He’d promised her once, back when we were seven, that he’d take care of me.

That promise died the day Vivienne entered our world. He claimed it was to “look after the sick,” but I knew better.

The screams around us jolted him back to reality.

He looked at the red welt on my shoulder from the recoil and hesitated—his expression softening.

“I’m sorry, Helena…”

I sidestepped before he could touch me, lips curling into a cold smile.

“It’s far from over. Maybe things are not what they seem. You’re jumping to conclusions, Sebastian.”

But he just laughed bitterly. “You’re the Whitmore heiress. Vivienne has no one. She’s all alone.”

He took a breath and looked at me—quietly, almost pleading.

“Helena… please. For the sake of everything we were, let Vivienne go.”

I gripped the pistol tighter and turned without another word. My chest heaved for just a second from how hard I was clenching my breath.

But this time, I was the one going to Castalia.

You got your wish, Sebastian Lowell.

That night, he sent a porcelain doll—just like he used to when we were children and he’d wronged me.

I sent it right back without a second thought.

All those years, I thought he stayed by my side because of our childhood, because of the bond we shared.

It took five years of a miserable marriage to wake me up.

He was kind out of duty—but it was always Vivienne he ached for.

And if that’s the case, then I have no reason to keep him in my life.

# Chapter 3

I went to my father and asked for my mother’s belongings back—

just a sketchbook and easel that looked plain on the outside. But inside were nearly monthly portraits of me before the age of six—

Each drawn while she was bedridden, clinging to what little life she had left.

Each page carried the quiet, unwavering love of a mother etched in fading pencil lines.

I didn’t learn the truth until Vivienne moved into our home—That my mother had had taken her own life, driven to despair after my father’s affair.

Vivienne was just two years younger than me.

The day I found out, I nearly beat her within an inch of her life.

But my father used my mother’s last keepsakes to shut me up—

Threatening to destroy them if I ever revealed Vivienne’s bloodline.

Now that I was about to leave for Castalia, it was time to even the score.

I took the sketchbook, paid a visit to my uncle, and then made a quiet stop at the Whitmore Group’s boardroom.

After years of swallowing humiliation, I wouldn’t leave without leaving behind a gift—for Richard, and for his precious bastard daughter.

Of course, none of it could leak before I left the country.

The timing had to be… surgical.

When I got home, my bedroom had been completely emptied.

Everything I owned had been dumped into the living room—

Including the thirty-seven porcelain dolls Sebastian once crafted by my hand.

Each lay shattered, their delicate pieces scattered like worthless junk.

Vivienne stood nearby, guilt across her fate–but the gleam in her eyes gave her away.

“I’m so sorry, Helena,” she stammered. “Dad said your room gets the best light—it will help me recover fast.”

“As for the dolls, the maids knocked them over while moving furniture. I’ll pay for them, whatever they cost. Daddy just gave me his Signature Gold Concierge Card.”

She held it up so casually—the very card reserved for the Whitmore heir.

I stepped forward, expression unreadable.

Sebastian suddenly moved between us, as if bracing for an attack.

“They’re just dolls, Helena. Is this really worth a meltdown?”

But they weren’t just dolls.

Sebastian had crafted every one of them by hand.

He once promised he’d keep making them for me—for as long as I liked.

Turns out his promises were just as fragile—and short-lived—as porcelain.

All it took was one little stunt from Vivienne, and they crumbled to dust.

Maybe my mistake was believing the promises of a man who’d already made his choice..

When I caught the smug glint in Vivienne’s eyes, I realized how pointless it all was.

I brushed past Sebastian, picked up my luggage, and moved into the guest room without a word.

He stood frozen at the bottom of the stairs, frowning as he watched me leave.

The next morning, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it to find all thirty-seven porcelain dolls lined up in silence—brand new, unfired, still soft touch.

There was only one person who’d do this.

I let out a bitter laugh and shut the door without a word.

But half an hour later, I opened the door again.

And this time brought the dolls inside.

# Chapter 4

Four days before my departure, aside from wringing a “dowry” out of that sorry excuse for a father, I s threw myself into training—pushing my body, sharpening my aim.

After riding practice, I came home to find Richard hosting a lavish birthday party for Vivienne.

As I walked in, she was descending the stairs in a gown from my own wardrobe—dripping in crystal sequins, playing the part of a noble heiress in front of a crowd that clapped like trained seals.

A few of her loyal little followers spotted me and curled their lips into sneers.

“Vivienne’s about to marry into nobility, and her sister can’t show up for her birthday. Talk about heartless.”

“What do you expect? She’s the one who chickened out and forced Vivienne to take her place. That kind of heartless witch doesn’t care about family.”

Clearly, while I was gone, Vivienne had been spreading her sob story to anyone who’d listen.

I turned to head upstairs, not wasting breath on idiots.

But they blocked my way—eyes darting toward Vivienne, then back to me with feigned outrage.

“Running off already? What’s the matter—guilty much?”

“Lady Sinclair must be turning in her grave, seeing how savage her daughter turned out!”

Before she could finish, I snapped the whip from my riding lesson—it cracked through the air, slamming her straight into the drink table.

Glass shattered. Blood bloomed.

She screamed, collapsed, crystal shards embedded in her arms.

I stepped forward, cool and calm. “Now that’s savage.”

The entire room froze, stunned by the sudden explosion of violence.

Then—chaos.

“Call an ambulance!”

“She’s insane! She did it on purpose!”

As the noise surged around me, I climbed the stairs without looking back, whip in hand.

Vivienne stormed out of the room, rage burning in her eyes.

“You volunteered for this, remember? Now I have to stay and care for your father, and you still ruin my birthday?”

I grabbed her chin with one hand, lips curling into a faint smile. “Volunteered?”

“You’re a homewrecker’s bastard with nothing but cheap tricks up your sleeve. The Syndicate isn’t a dumpster for hand-me-down bastards. If they don’t like what they see, they’ll toss you out like yesterday’s trash.”

“And as for taking care of him?”

I tightened my grip. Her face went pale with pain.

“Are you caring for Richard Whitmore or just circling his inheritance? You know damn well which it is. So drop the act—you’re making people sick.”

Her cheeks flushed crimson with fury, but she didn’t dare argue out loud.

She fled sobbing—no, screaming—as three slender red snakes slid behind her like shadows.

“I know I shouldn’t have used your room—but did you really have to scare me like that?”

“I… I can’t breathe… my asthma—it’s acting up again…”

She gasped dramatically and collapsed to the floor, clutching her chest.

“Vivienne!”

Sebastian rushed over and pulled her into his arms, glaring up at me with barely restrained fury.

“Are you out of your mind? Do you even know what a shock like that could do to someone with asthma?! Are you insane?”

“You think I did this?”

He gritted his teeth. “Who else? Vivienne wouldn’t hurt a fly. But you? Helena—you ride, you shoot, you climb cliffs. Nothing you do would surprise me.”

“God, what if something rally happens to her? Then what? Who’s supposed to marry into the Syndicate in your place?”

Furious, I grabbed one of the snakes by the head and flung it straight at Vivienne.

“Ahhh!”

She shrieked as it landed inches her face, her pupils shrinking with terror—funny how her asthma vanished.

I wanted to see if Sebastian would still defend her after that.

Of course, just as it neared her, Sebastian lunged forward—his grip crushing my wrist like a vice.

“Still denying it? Helena, when did you become so cold and cruel?”

Just like before.

Whenever it came to Vivienne, we’d go to war without hesitation.

But neither of us ever walked away.

“Enough!”

Richard stormed into the room, livid.

“This is what I get for not disciplining you! Attacking your own sister like this?!”

“I don’t have a daughter like you. You are dead to me—get out of my house!”

I turned, lips curled in a frigid smile.

Vivienne, ever the fragile saint, sniffled tearfully.

“Please… don’t scold her on my account…”

But Sebastian stayed silent.

He laid her in Richard’s arms with care—and then, quietly, fell into step behind me.

“I’ll take you home.

# Chapter 5

Sebastian drove me to Willowcrest Cottage—

the private retreat my mother left me, a place only she and I ever shared. When we were young, he’d always come here with me whenever I was upset.

It used to be our escape—from them, from the house, from everything.

Before he left, he looked at me with something unreadable in his eyes.

“Want me to stay the night?” he asked quietly.

I did not turn around, voice glacial. “No. And don’t ever set foot here again.”

His breath caught—ragged and uneven.

Just as the door shut behind him, I heard a whisper, faint as a dying flame:

“…I’m sorry.”

I had no intention of going back to that house full of lies—

But my mother’s things still waited for me there. I brought a moving crew with me, just in case.



I didn’t expect to walk into the living room—and find Vivienne giggling as she smeared bright paint across one of my mother’s last surviving sketches.

The canvas was ruined—just smears of color and the echo of something precious, lost.

“Put that down!”

I shouted so sharply she jumped, flinching like a child caught stealing.

Then she stumbled—conveniently—straight into the easel.

Crash.

The last piece of my mother’s world shattered into splinters.

Vivienne scrambled up, slapped herself theatrically, like a child putting on a show, and then dropped to her knees—right on the one intact piece of the ruined stand.

“I’m so sorry, Helena! I didn’t mean to! I was upset and asked Sebastian to bring over some supplies to distract me. Please don’t be angry—I’ll buy you a whole new set, I promise!”

Rage blurred my vision.

My hand flew to the fruit knife on the coffee table—burning with the urge to carve her open.

I wanted to carve her open.

But before I could move, Sebastian stepped between us, holding me back.

“They were just some old drawings,” he said. “If they matter so much, I’ll get you perfect replicas.”

I stared at him, trembling with rage.

“Do you even understand what you just said? That was all I had left of my mother.”

“I know.” His voice faltered. “But you destroyed Vivienne’s future. Isn’t that worth a few pieces of paper in return?”

My fingers clenched tighter around the knife.

“You think you get to touch anything that’s mine?!”

Before he could dodge, the blade grazed his hand—not deep, but enough for blood to fall in slow, steady drops.

It dripped steadily to the floor.

“No! Don’t hurt him!” Vivienne screamed, lunging forward. “It’s my fault—don’t take it out on him! He’s a surgeon, his hands—he needs his hands!”

I raised the knife again, this time heading straight for her face.

“Stop!” Sebastian roared.

I didn’t.

He wrapped an arm around Vivienne and shoved me back with all his strength.

“I said STOP!” My head slammed into the corner of the wall. Warmth spilled down my forehead—thick, sticky, red.

Sebastian froze, eyes wide with horror. He let go of Vivienne and rushed to my side, gathering me into his arms.

“Why do you always do this?” he muttered hoarsely. “You throw yourself over the edge—just to make me feel like the villain… Is that what you want?”

The words slipped out of him like instinct.

But even he looked stunned at his own words.

Always?

Helena Whitmore was never the type to hurt herself for pity.

So why did he say it like this had happened before?

# Chapter 6

I was barely conscious when they took me to the hospital.

Sebastian didn’t leave my side for three days.

When I finally woke up, he was sitting by my bed, quietly peeling an apple, his expression unreadable—the weight in his silence heavier than anything I’d ever seen.

“I’ll marry you,” he said at last.

“I never forgot the promise I made.”

I said nothing.

He held out a slice. “I said I’d protect you for life. I meant it.”

Then came the words that ruined it.

“But Vivienne… don’t make things hard for her.”

I turned my head and pulled the blanket over my face, hiding the sting, hiding everything.

He stayed for a moment longer, watching me in silence.

Then he placed the apple on the nightstand and left.

I knew exactly where he was going—back to her.

That afternoon, I checked myself out.

Hat low, mask on, I disappeared into the airport crowd—alone.

I never expected him to come after me.

But just before boarding, Sebastian showed up, out of breath and eyes full of regret.

“I didn’t protect you like I should have,” he said softly. “Whatever happens from now on… call me, okay?”

I glanced at him—just briefly, caught off guard.

Then he pressed a card into my hand.

“Take it… an apology… from your sister. She’s got a temper, but… try to understand her, yeah?”

Did he seriously think I was Vivienne?

I nearly laughed out loud. The audacity. I slapped his hand away.

“It’s not too late to undo the mess you made,” I said coldly.

Sebastian stepped closer.

“I can help. New name. New passport. Just vanish for a while–I’ll cover it all.

Nestled in the foothills of the Alps, this picturesque lake is not just a feast for the eyes but also a canvas for adventure and discovery.

Start your journey by exploring the charming towns of Bellagio, Varenna, and Menaggio. Stroll along the narrow cobblestone streets, marveling at the centuries-old architecture and breathtaking lake views. Each town offers unique shops and cafés where you can enjoy a leisurely coffee or gelato, ensuring a balanced experience of sightseeing and rest.

For the adventurous souls, Lake Como is a paradise. Consider hiking the Sentiero del Viandante, a scenic trail that runs along the eastern shore of the lake, providing awe-inspiring vistas. Water sports like kayaking and sailing offer a different perspective of the lake’s beauty while keeping your adrenaline pumping. Take a boat tour to explore the beautiful villas dotting the shoreline, such as the famous Villa del Balbianello, each telling tales of history amidst lush gardens.

After a day of exploration, indulge in the local cuisine. Savor traditional dishes at lakeside restaurants, where you can unwind with a glass of fine Italian wine while watching the sun set over the water. The culinary experience complements your active day, allowing for both enjoyment and rejuvenation.

Finally, don’t forget to take some time for self-reflection at tranquil spots around the lake. Find a serene bench or take a peaceful lakeside walk to absorb the natural beauty that surrounds you. This balance of activities and rest—between exploration and relaxation—ensures a transformed journey that leaves you with unforgettable memories of Lake Como, Italy.

1mittgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timor/comments/1mittgi/solo_travel_basics_2025_from_an_american/,Solo Travel Basics 2025 from an American,"Writing this from the Díli airport to share a bunch of miscellaneous travel tips for anyone visiting Timor-Leste (East Timor) in August 2025 or later.

I bought an Airalo “Discover” eSIM and activated it prior to getting to the country assuming it would work. It did not work. I instead bought an ESIM at the airport from Telkomcel (the booth all the way to the right of the three SIM card booths when you exit the airport) for $14.50 USD that gave me unlimited high speed data for 7 days. Data was fast enough for regular Instagram and Reddit usage. I experienced only about 15 minutes per day of outage, but restarting my phone usually fixed it. I have a U.S. purchased iPhone 15 pro.

They do not accept $1 bills here - I was very surprised to learn that. Ideally, bring enough $5 and $10 USD bills. Larger places will take $20 USD, but smaller places and taxis might not be able to give you change. The local currency is centivos where a 100 centivo coin is equal to $1 USD.

Quality of bills matters - places will not accept a raggedy or tattered $5 or $10. Make sure your bills aren’t ripped or fraying.

The taxis from the airport cost $15 to most destinations in the city. The taxi cars are very very old and do not have seatbelts.

There is no water refill at the airport. I would recommend bringing enough water from your original flight destination to keep you hydrated until you get to your accommodations or a grocery store.

There aren’t really mosquitos during the daytime. When it gets dark (6:30pm in August) the mosquitos come out in force. I had some 100% deet (maybe it was 97% deet) bug spray and avoided getting bitten by putting some on in the evening and reapplying right before sleep.

I did not connect to WiFi a single time in the country. BUT I had unlimited data. Most places like coffee shops or restaurants do not have wifi, outside of the highest end hotels.

There is no Uber/Lyft/Grab, so you will need old school taxis to transit. I recommend getting the WhatsApp number of at least one taxi driver if you can communicate with them well. You can WhatsApp message them to ask for a ride and if business is slow (as is typical), they will come pick you up.

Most places don’t have written addresses in the country. Send a screenshot of Google/Apple maps with your location circled to help your taxi driver find you if you’re not in one of the main locations.

It is possible to walk around the city, but there are no stoplights so crossing the road can be very dangerous. The safest place to walk is Avenida de Portugal which is right by the water in the northern part of the city.

Timor Plaza shopping mall is the safest, most central place for food. Most things there are $5-7 USD to be paid in cash. I did not use my credit card a single time in the country.

I saw one ATM my whole time here, but did not try to use it. I recommend having about $150 cash per day minimum, but more if you are doing tours. My day tour was $220 and I brought about $500 total to the country. I have about $100 remaining leaving after two days.

That’s all for now - I will share more about tours and experiences after I have some downtime post-transit! For now though, I had a great experience with JUBENTOS Timor Adventures (successor to the widely-reviewed Timor Adventures company that also used to be run by the same guy Julio, but that stopped operating during the pandemic then rebranded and came back) so if you need a Díli tour in a pinch, that’s a great company to go with. You can find their website and WhatsApp them there.",3,1754450214.0,Timor,4,1.0,False

1mitoq4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mitoq4,"Rare gem near Guting MRT, our dream apartment is up for rent (Western-style, renovated)","We’re not putting this on any rental sites just yet. Thought I’d share here first in case someone’s looking for something special.

A little backstory:
I’m American and have been living in Taiwan for 15 years. My husband’s Taiwanese. A few years ago, we bought this apartment and renovated it ourselves… literally made it our dream home. We thought we’d be here forever. So everything was designed with comfort, quality, and long-term living in mind.

We didn’t cut corners. This wasn’t a flip or a landlord project. We chose materials and appliances that made daily life feel easy and cozy. If you’ve ever walked into a Taipei rental and immediately wanted to replace everything, you’ll get why this place feels different.

We lived here until recently, but after having kids, we needed more space and moved out to Linkou. Since then, a close friend has been living here but he’s moving out this month, so we’re looking for someone new.

It’s not massive, but it’s one of those rare Taipei apartments where every detail has been considered. It lives larger than it looks, whether you’re cooking, working, or hosting a couple friends. Originally a 2-bedroom, but we knocked down a wall to make the layout more open. Now it’s a large 1-bedroom plus a dining room, chill spot, or office space. It’s on the 5th floor of a walk-up (no elevator), but it gets decent light and feels surprisingly quiet for how central it is.

The location’s excellent! Just a 3-minute walk to Guting MRT (green/orange lines), and tucked away on a quieter side street. You can walk to coffee, groceries, breakfast shops, etc. Super livable. Super close to NTU AND NTNU.

Practical details:
-Rent is $48K/month.
-Water, electricity, internet is separate.
-Standard two-month deposit.
-One-year lease minimum. Long-term preferred.
-Pets are welcome, just be the kind of owner we’d want as a neighbor. We’re animal lovers ourselves and know how hard it can be to find a pet-friendly place in the city.

Some of the things that made this place feel like home:
• Real wood floors (not laminate)
• Western-style kitchen: Bosch dishwasher, oven, stovetop, fridge
• Panasonic AC units with heat in every room (soooo nice in winter)
• Floor-to-ceiling windows/sliding doors
• Toto toilet
• Huge shower + tub combo
• Silent double-paned windows
• Built-in water filter at the kitchen sink
• Tons of built-in storage in the bedroom (custom wardrobe)
• Built-in bookshelf in extra room
• Large Panasonic Washing machine
• Partially furnished: TV, kitchen chairs, and a few other items 

It’s a 5th floor walk-up, and the water heater is gas (pretty standard for older buildings but means you’ll need to replace the tank when it runs out), but overall it’s a warm, functional space that really feels like home… because it was.

Move-in anytime after mid-August. Hoping to confirm someone by end of the month.

We’re not looking for just any renter — ideally someone who’ll appreciate the space, care for it, and really enjoy living here like we did.

We’re an American–Taiwanese couple. English and Chinese both fine. Happy to answer questions or show the place.

None of the actors will likely meet with me or my date as it is a big theater. I want to bring him to the play and then have dinner afterwards, but not mention I know some of the actors because I don't want to date someone who isn't kind and I've previously found small cues like this on a first date are usually bigger 'red flags'.

I couldn’t help but wonder how intentional it seemed given that she was talking about Interstellar and worm holes before that happened. It didn’t sound like there was a window open or like an accidental noise, it felt like they meant for it to sound like someone placed those books there for her to read. But I haven’t seen anyone, on here at least, talking about it since this movie came out. 

I really do hope that they address this or tie it back in but given that there’s already so many open threads this saga, my hopes are pretty low.

Nowadays, women are getting 100s of DMs and constant attention on social media. So just sliding into her DMs with “hi” or “you’re cute” is not going to make any difference. In fact, being desperate makes you look low-value.

But if you live a good life  you're working on your goals, you have achievements, you ride a nice bike, dress well, keep yourself fit — then your attention has value.
That’s why, never beg for attention. Just drop one message. If she’s genuinely interested, she’ll respond. If not, then apply my rule: FDB  Fk The Bitch.**

Yes, harsh words — but it’s about mindset, not disrespect. If she ignores your attention, then you ignore her and smile at another woman.

Out of 10 women:

5 might give you their WhatsApp.

Out of those 5, 3 will actually have conversations.

Then ask for a coffee meet. If she gives excuses and bullshit, FDB.

Out of 3, 2 may go out with you. Then ask for dinner.

If she rejects again, FDB.

1 might vibe with you, maybe even become desperate for your time.
That’s a high-quality woman. If not, keep moving.


This is the cycle:
Women want attention. Men want sex.
If the cycle is broken, men become needy, women lose interest. So don’t break the cycle  level up, give less attention, and never chase.

Remember:
High-value men don’t beg. They choose.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I lived off bread and eggs. No coffee, no takeout.  
My girlfriend broke up with me. Said I was emotionally unavailable.  
I couldn’t focus. My lease ended. I crashed on a friend’s couch.

Every day I worked from McDonald’s with a $2 refill and my laptop.  
I didn’t have a roadmap. No investors. No followers.  
Just one belief:

*If I couldn’t fix my own relationship, maybe I could help someone else fix theirs.*

One day one guy sitting nearby started talking to me.  
Turned out he was a licensed therapist.  
I told him my idea. He loved it.  
He became the app’s first expert — even filmed welcome videos.

A few weeks later, I messaged a well-known relationship coach on Instagram with over 700k followers.  
To my surprise, she replied.  
She said the app felt “too cold… like a spreadsheet.”  
“Where’s the softness?” she asked.  
“Where’s the healing?”  
She was right.

I pulled 20-hour days rewriting everything — the copy, the colors, the onboarding flow.  
I needed to resubmit by Friday to hit the Sunday morning release window.  
Barely made it.

I launched at 9:00 AM Sunday.

That same day, I DMed every person I knew who had ever vented to me about a breakup.  
Ex-coworkers. Old friends. Random internet strangers.  
Just trying to get it into the right hands.

Monday morning, I checked the dashboard:  
It featured #1 on Product Hunt.  
It made $17,000 in revenue the next week.

I just stared at the screen.  
For the first time in months, I breathed.  
And yeah… I cried.

>**None of that happened.**

Not the bread and eggs.  
Not the breakup.  
Not the therapist at McDonald’s.  
Not the Instagram coach.  
Not the Product Hunt launch.  
Not the crying.  
Not the $17K.

But you read it all, didn’t you?

That’s the power of storytelling.

Now imagine if I posted this instead:  
“Hey, I made a relationship coaching app. Wanna sign up?”

You’d scroll past it without a second thought.

But version one?  
You felt something.  
You rooted for the underdog.  
You wanted to know how it ended.

That’s what stories do.

If you’re building something and nobody cares:

* Don’t just pitch.
* Tell the real story.
* Show the friction, not just the features.
* Make it feel like something.

Because people don’t share landing pages.  
They share narratives.

Would love to hear yours too.

I was kind of scared at first. I first met these people in a bar and they have been the best friends a person can ask for. But, I was worried if they are gonna get on my case for not drinking, you know? Like, “hey buddy, no beers? No shots? What’s wrong?”

Funny moment: they tried some weird “Mexican candy” shot, and asked me if I was interested. I said no, and the bartender was like: “yeah, I figured you didn’t want one, but I wanted to ask.” Drinks come, shots taken, and the “uuuck” faces on these dudes, and their “oh damn this is terrible” moment made me doubly proud of my choice.

But no, nobody cared that I was crushing coffee and water all day. The bartender didn’t even care that I needed a second pot of coffee. In fact, I left with a tab of zero dollars. It felt nice to have a sober outing (at a bar) with my drinking homies and I didn’t get questioned, pressured, or anything. They just kind of did their thing while I did mine.

I love my friends. Peer pressure is real at any age, especially if you are around other folks that can handle their drinks better than we can.

We started texting back and forth on Bumble and met up for coffee our first date which was a little over two weeks ago. We had a decent convo over Bumble but I initiated the plans to meet up for coffee. We then meet up for coffee. He asked me for my number during the date and we proceeded to do work together until about 8pm that day. Spending about 8 hours together. On the first date, he seemed very interested, holding my hand, asking to kiss me, and putting his arm around me on the bench. 

Then I don’t hear from him until this past Friday, 5 days later. He texts me asking me how I’m doing and that he really enjoyed our date. He said he’s been super busy and that he felt sick this week and had to take work off. He also has a really demanding work schedule as he works in the medical field. I reciprocated that I enjoyed our date too. He then asked me if I wanted to meet on Saturday. 

Fast forward to Saturday, I text him confirming plans and we meet up. We have an amazing date together. We hold hands, have good banter and conversations, we grab drinks, and I feel like we got physically closer. When he drove us he put his hand on my thigh. We go back to his house for a movie and we cuddle a bit and then I drive myself home. He followed up the date the next day saying he had a lot of fun. I reciprocated the sentiment and I added that I hope he has a good day. He said “thanks, you too!” And I hearted his message.

It’s 8pm and I’m kinda overthinking that he hasn’t texted me. I’m thinking to follow up tomorrow and ask him how his week is going? Is his lack of communication a sign of disinterest or him taking it slow?

I was the kid who didn’t talk back, who didn’t cry too loud, who didn’t make scenes in public. My parents loved to brag: *“She’s so well-behaved!”* What they meant was: *“She doesn’t need anything.”*

I learned early that speaking up meant drama, punishment, or just being brushed off. So I stopped. I became the listener. The “mature one.” The one who handled her own emotions quietly.

Fast forward to this year, I’m in my first real relationship. Nothing toxic, just… moments. Moments where I’d feel uncomfortable but say nothing. Moments where I’d laugh off things that actually hurt. Moments where I’d bite my tongue even when I wanted to scream, *“This isn’t okay.”*

Last month, we got into an argument. I don't even remember how it started, something about plans changing. But I froze. Completely shut down. My partner kept asking, “What’s wrong? Just talk to me.” And I literally couldn’t. Not because I didn’t want to. Because I didn’t *know how.*

That moment shook me. I realized I’d been carrying a silence I never chose, but learned. I wasn’t being chill or easygoing. I was just conditioned to shrink myself for peace.

Since then, I’ve started journaling again. Saying “no” to small things. Even correcting my coffee order when it's wrong. It might sound silly, but it’s a start.

Silence can be comforting, but not when it’s hiding your voice.",6,1754448494.0,story,0,1.0,False

1mit6ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1mit6ek/continental_breakfast_mishap/,Continental Breakfast Mishap,"**My question -- is door hangar pickup for continental breakfast the responsibility of the room steward**?

Just got off Freedom OTS 3 night.  On the second night, my wife (in my room) and daughters (in the room next door) decided to order the continental breakfast because they had an early excursion in Nassau and we knew that Windjammer would be slammed.  So, they filled out the form, and we put it on each door around 10:30pm or 11ish, with a 7am requested service delivery.  Went to bed, slept well.

I got up around 6:30 the next morning to head down to Cafe Promenade and get the coffee for my wife and I.  Immediately noticed that the hangers on both rooms were still on the doors.  Not a good sign!  It's been years since I have ordered the breakfast on RCCL, so I was not totally sure how it worked, but I figured that if they did not pick up the hangers, then no food was going to be delivered.  So I grabbed some pastries at Cafe Promenade for everyone.

I am guessing that this is not a miss by the room steward, and that someone from the food service staff makes a tour sometime after midnight or 2am to collect these.   Has anyone ever had similar issues on RCCL?  It was not a biggie, and I did not mention it to anyone, but I may mention it in the survey if I can confirm that it's not going to reflect badly on the room steward.  It's such a minor issue that I don't want to get anyone in trouble over it, so maybe there is no way to mention it and NOT have it traced back to a specific employee.  I am definitely glad that I was able to grab stuff at Cafe Promenade instead of sitting in the room waiting for food that was never going to show up.

Chapter Fourteen
lost one.

I woke to wetness.
Not just damp — soaked. Cold seeped into my spine through the stone beneath me, muddy and uneven. Water dripped from somewhere high above, rhythmic and hollow, like a ticking clock counting down.
My wrists were bound. My ankles, too — tight rope, rough against skin rubbed raw.
I tried to move. I couldn’t.
It was pitch black, but I knew I wasn’t alone.
I could feel them. Breathing.
Then came the first flicker of light.
Candles — faint and scattered — nestled into holes in the dirt walls like watching eyes. They cast long, flickering shadows across what looked like a tunnel carved crudely from the earth. The air was thick with mildew and rot. Something had died down here. Or was still dying.
The moment I shifted, the figures moved.
I hadn’t noticed them until then. They hadn’t made a sound.
There were dozens.
Standing silently against the walls in stained robes — hooded, faceless. Their fabric hung like old parchment, waterlogged and clinging to their thin frames. Some had symbols drawn across their chests in what looked like ash. Others… in something darker.
They didn’t speak.
They didn’t need to.
Their presence was a pressure, like the air itself was being strangled around me.
And then — they began to chant.
A low, guttural sound at first, like wind through a cave. Then louder. Sharper. Words I didn’t know but somehow recognized. Words that scraped against my brain like glass on bone. The sound filled the space, bouncing off the walls, making the candles tremble.
I whimpered. I didn’t mean to, but the sound slipped out.
One of them broke away from the wall.
They crept toward me with slow, calculated steps — not clumsy or stiff, but practiced, like they’d done this a hundred times before. Like they’d been waiting.
They knelt beside me, their face hidden beneath the hood.
I could feel their breath — wet and cold.
“Welcome back, lost one.”
The voice was genderless. Soft, almost kind — but hollow, like it had no soul behind it.
They pressed something cold against my forehead — a stone, or maybe bone. It stung. Then they stepped back.
Another figure came forward.
“Welcome back, lost one.”
Over and over.
Each one leaned in close, whispered those same words like a curse, and stepped away. By the seventh, I was trembling. By the tenth, I couldn’t breathe.
My pulse was thundering in my ears. I could barely see.
The room felt alive, breathing, pulsing, throbbing with the rhythm of the chant.
Then the final figure stepped out of the shadows.
Their robe was darker than the rest. Blackened at the sleeves. Wet at the hem.
They didn’t walk — they glided.
The others moved aside to let them pass, heads bowed.
The figure crouched down in front of me.
Their hood hung low, but I could just barely make out a mouth — wide, colorless, cracked. It didn’t move when they spoke.
The voice slithered out.
“Lanie is to blame.”
I froze.
“You must remove the threat…”
The other voices fell completely silent. Even the dripping water seemed to stop.
“…and restore the balance back to Earth.”
Their face was inches from mine now.
I could smell decay on their breath.
“Or God will be displeased…”
They reached a hand toward me — long fingers, bone-thin.
“…and punish you, Emily Harper.”
When they said my name, it felt like a nail being driven into my spine. My vision blurred. I couldn’t even scream. My voice was gone.
Then — one by one — they came back.
The robed figures surrounded me in a perfect circle.
Each knelt at my wrists.
Each pulled up my sleeve, baring skin already mottled with dirt and bruises.
Their fingers were cold, wet — they dipped them into something thick and dark red in the bowls beside them.
Blood.
Still warm.
Fresh.
They rubbed it into my skin slowly, deliberately — pressing their thumbs into the hollow of my wrists, circling, staining.
As they marked me, they began to chant again, louder this time, more frenzied. The language twisted and snapped through the air, a kind of primal rhythm, like the sound of insects skittering just beneath your skin.
The pressure in the room grew unbearable. I felt like I was being swallowed. Like the earth itself wanted me gone.
My body shook. I tried to scream. Nothing came out.
The last figure pulled away from me and raised their hands toward the dripping ceiling.
The candles blew out — every single one.
And in the instant before I lost consciousness, I heard it:
A voice that did not belong to anyone in that room.
A voice that came from inside me.
“You were never meant to leave.”
And then—
blackness.

Chapter Fifteen
“Was it real… or was I?”

I woke up staring at the ceiling.
The familiar water stain above the window.
The soft whir of the fan near the bed.
Light slanting through the blinds, catching on floating dust.
My apartment.
I sat up slowly. My sheets weren’t dirty. No bruises on my wrists. No blood.
The books were still on the table. The notebook open where I’d left it. My phone charging beside the bed. The hum of traffic outside.
Normal.
Too normal.
I moved through the space like a ghost. Everything was untouched — my mug still in the sink from two days ago, laundry still unfolded in the basket by the couch. The books I’d checked out from the library sat in a neat stack.
No candles.
No dirt.
No chanting voices.
Had I dreamed it all?
The underground chamber. The robes. The voice.
“God will be displeased.”
It rang in my skull like a warning bell.
I looked down at my hands. They didn’t shake.
But I could feel something… off.
Like my body remembered things my mind wanted to forget.
Then came the knock.
Three short raps at the door.
I didn’t move.
Then again, gentler.
“Emmy?”
Lanie’s voice.
I froze.
The name struck me like a slap. The sound of her outside the door made my stomach twist.
“It’s me… please open the door.”
Something inside me shifted.
Clicked.
Snapped into place.
Not me. Not mine. Not Emily.
The air in the room felt warped. Like the floor beneath me tilted. The warmth of sunlight meant nothing.
All I could hear were those words:
“Lanie is to blame.”
“Remove the threat.”
“Restore the balance.”
I walked to the door slowly, numb, floating.
When I opened it, Lanie rushed in like a storm, pulling her hood down, eyes wide.
“Oh thank God,” she breathed. “You’re okay.”
I said nothing.
She turned toward me. “Emmy, where the hell have you been? I—I’ve been calling nonstop. I even drove by your work just in case.” She gave a breathless little laugh. “I thought something happened to you. After the library—after what you said—I didn’t know what to think.”
Still, I said nothing.
She stepped closer, searching my face. “Are you sick? You look pale. Did something happen? Did you… remember something?”
I blinked at her slowly.
The light caught in her eyes. They looked full of worry. Love, even.
But to me, they looked like a lie.
“God will be displeased.”
“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “If I pushed you too hard. If telling you about the Restoration triggered something. I just—Emily, I thought you wanted to know the truth. I was only trying to help.”
The word help felt poisonous in my ears.
She kept talking.
“There’s something wrong with that place, I know there is. And I know you felt it too, the dreams, the—” she faltered, “—the memories, or whatever they are. But we can figure it out together. You and me. We always said that, right?”
I stared through her.
Her voice echoed like it was coming from underwater. My head throbbed.
Her hand brushed my arm gently.
“Please say something.”
My mouth opened. But it wasn’t my voice that wanted to come out.
I was stuck somewhere between two selves. One that loved her, needed her, trusted her—
—and one that knew she had to go.
The silence stretched until she whispered, “You’re scaring me.”
I tilted my head, studying her face like it belonged to someone I used to know.
I could still remember the warmth of her hands on mine. The way she smiled like she knew what I was thinking. The first time I’d seen her behind that counter at the café, humming along to some song I didn’t recognize.
But that felt like a memory that belonged to someone else now.
I wasn’t sure who I was anymore.
“Lanie is to blame.”
“You must remove the threat.”
Lanie’s brow furrowed. “Emmy?”
I looked down at her hand on my arm.
She was still touching me.
Still close.
Still here.
And I could feel it—inside me—rising.
Like something ancient had been stirred awake.
God will be displeased.
And all I could think was:
How easy it would be.

Chapter Sixteen
The body remembers what the mind denies.

“I’ll be right back,” I said softly.
My voice sounded flat. Hollow. Almost like someone else said it for me.
Lanie blinked, surprised, but nodded. “Okay. I’ll stay right here, Em.”
She smiled nervously and sat back on the couch, hugging her knees to her chest.
I turned and walked down the short hallway to my bedroom. The air felt thick, charged. Like walking underwater.
As I pushed open the door, I saw it immediately.
The knife.
It was laid across the center of my bed. Not tossed. Not dropped. Placed. Carefully.
The hilt faced me. Almost like an invitation.
It wasn’t one of my kitchen knives. I would’ve remembered one like this.
The blade was long and curved slightly, like a ritualistic sickle. Its edge was dark—too dark—and jagged like it had been forged by hand, not manufactured. Carved into the metal were symbols—tiny, etched markings that looked like the ones in the books from the library. Symbols I hadn’t been able to translate.
But somehow, I knew what they meant now.
Balance. Purity. Sacrifice.
The handle was wrapped in worn leather, stained a deep, rusted brown. Blood, I realized. Old. Years old, maybe more.
My fingers wrapped around it before I could think.
It was warm.
As though it had just been used.
And the moment I touched it, something in me went quiet. Still.
Like my mind had been pushed aside and something else had taken the wheel.
I turned and walked back toward the living room, knife gripped behind my back, hidden beneath the folds of my sweatshirt.
Lanie was still talking when I entered. Pacing slightly now, twisting her fingers together.
“I just think maybe something’s wrong. Like, seriously wrong, Emily. You haven’t been sleeping, and you’re seeing things. I know the Restoration stuff is dark, but maybe it triggered something. Like a memory or a trauma or—I don’t know.”
I didn’t speak.
She looked at me with soft eyes.
“I’m not saying you’re crazy. I’m not,” she said quickly. “I just—maybe you need help. Real help. I’ll go with you. I’ll stay with you. I love you, Em.”
That last part landed somewhere deep inside me. Buried beneath whatever had taken over.
But it wasn’t enough.
I stepped closer.
Lanie’s eyes flicked down, catching the shift in my posture. The tension. Her expression changed—concern turning into confusion. Then fear.
“Em…?”
She didn’t have time to say anything else.
The first stab landed just below her ribs.
She gasped—sharp and high-pitched—and stumbled backward into the table.
I followed.
Another stab.
And another.
And another.
Blood sprayed across my floor. Splattered up my arms. Warm. Immediate.
Lanie let out a choked sob, barely able to breathe.
I don’t know how many times I stabbed her. I didn’t count.
Only that I didn’t stop until she wasn’t moving.
Until her eyes were wide and glassy.
Until the blade stopped meeting resistance.
And then—
Silence.
Time restarted.
My hands were soaked. The knife slick. The smell of iron and bile filled the room.
Her blood was everywhere.
On me. On the floor. On her.
And she wasn’t breathing.
I stared at her body, heart pounding in my chest.
And suddenly, whatever had been inside me was gone.
Gone.
And I was back.
Truly back.
I dropped the knife and stumbled backward.
“No—no no no no—”
The words spilled from my lips like vomit.
I tripped over the rug and ran down the hallway, crashing into the bathroom and collapsing over the toilet.
My body heaved. I retched so hard I saw stars.
I couldn’t stop shaking.
When it was over, I looked up—slowly—into the mirror above the sink.
Blood on my neck.
Blood smeared across my cheek like war paint.
My eyes were wide and red-rimmed, and they didn’t look like mine. Again.
What did I do?
I pressed my hands to the sink, trying to breathe.
Tried to tell myself it wasn’t real.
Tried to tell myself it was another dream.
But the blood was real.
Lanie was real.
And now she was dead.
Because of me.
Because something told me to.
Because I listened.
Because I couldn’t stop it.
I sank to the floor, my back against the wall, hands still trembling and slick with blood.
And I cried like a child.


Chapter Seventeen
If it disappears, did it ever happen?

I don’t know how long I sat there on the bathroom floor.
Eventually the sobbing stopped.
The shaking dulled.
I could breathe again, if only just barely.
The tile was cold beneath me. The silence in the apartment was suffocating, loud in its emptiness. The kind of quiet that pressed in from all sides.
I dragged myself to my feet, swaying a little, and splashed water on my face. The sink was still running. The mirror still fogged from my panicked breath.
Blood was smeared across my shirt, my sleeves. Under my nails. Drying now.
It was real.
It had to be.
And that meant… Lanie’s body was still in the living room.
The thought almost dropped me again.
But some part of me—some buried, rational instinct—clicked on. A survival mechanism.
“You have to clean it.”
Not because it was the right thing.
Not because I wanted to.
Because something deep in me whispered: “If anyone sees this, it’s over.”
I stepped out of the bathroom, not letting myself look back toward the living room.
Down the hallway, just past the linen closet, was a narrow door. The utility closet.
I opened it with shaking hands and pulled out the bleach. A pack of old rags. A half-used bottle of carpet cleaner. Latex gloves. A trash bag.
I moved like I was sleepwalking.
Like I’d done this before.
Which terrified me more than anything.
Supplies in hand, I finally turned toward the living room.
And froze.
The blood was gone.
The body was gone.
The couch was clean. No stains on the floor. No broken lamp. No overturned table.
Just silence.
Just… normal.
Like nothing had happened at all.
I dropped the bag.
Walked slowly toward the couch.
No drag marks. No traces. Not even a stray dark spot.
The air didn’t even smell like iron anymore.
I dropped to my knees, touching the carpet where she had fallen—where I had stabbed her, over and over again.
Nothing.
My hands were clean.
I looked down at my arms.
Still clean.
The sleeves of my shirt were dry. White. Untouched.
I gasped and ran back down the hallway, flipping the bathroom light on.
No blood in the sink.
No smears on the floor.
I spun to the mirror and grabbed the edges of it.
My face was clean.
There was no blood.
No evidence.
Nothing at all.
My chest tightened.
“No, no, no. I didn’t make it up.”
I was whispering to myself now.
“She was here. She was here. I saw it. I did it. I felt it.”
I gripped the counter, knuckles white.
If she was gone—if everything was gone—then where was she?
Did someone come?
Did someone clean it up?
Or… was it never there to begin with?
Was this what madness felt like?
Was I still under their influence?
Still dreaming?
Or had I done something so horrible that my mind had simply erased it to survive?
I stumbled backward out of the bathroom, heart in my throat, ears ringing.
I looked at the front door.
Still locked.
The knife?
I turned back toward my room—but I already knew.
It was gone, too.
Not a drop of blood.
Not a sign of struggle.
Not a sound.
Just me.
Just silence.
Just that gnawing question crawling up my spine:
What is happening to me?


Chapter Eighteen
If no one remembers her… was she ever real?

I picked it up and opened my messages. Scrolled instinctively to her name.
Nothing.
The thread was gone.
No photos. No texts. No calls.
I blinked, backed out of the message app, and checked my recent calls.
Gone.
Her number wasn’t there.
Not even under the “recently deleted” section.
I scrolled faster. No voicemails. No history.
My throat tightened as I tapped out her number manually, the one I’d memorized weeks ago.
Ring.
Ring.
Then—
“You have reached an invalid number. Please check the number and try again.”
I stared at the screen, pulse pounding in my ears.
That didn’t make sense.
I had the number right.
I knew I did.
I tried texting her instead, just a single word:
“Lanie?”
A second passed. Then two.
And then:
Message Not Delivered.
I sent it again.
Same thing.
Undelivered. Gone.
I went back to the top of my contacts list.
Her name wasn’t there.
It was like she’d been erased.
Like she never existed in my phone at all.
I sat on the couch and stared at the wall, gripping my phone with both hands like it might slip away from me too.
Where did she go?
Where did my Lanie go?
The only person who ever made me feel seen.
Who didn’t talk to me like I was fragile or broken or halfway out of my mind.
She sat with me in silence when I needed it. Laughed at my awkward jokes. Gave me pieces of her past like puzzle fragments.
I knew her. I did.
She was real.
She had to be.
I grabbed my bag and keys and ran out the door.
The café was exactly as I remembered it. White-tile floor. Chalkboard menu hanging by the pastry case. The same lopsided fern by the window that was always a little too dry.
My eyes scanned the space, already knowing where she’d be—
Behind the counter. Hair pulled back.
She wasn’t there.
Just a guy with a beanie and a girl with purple hair, pouring drinks. No sign of Lanie.
I stepped up to the counter, heart hammering.
“Hi—sorry, um… is Lanie working today?”
The girl blinked at me. “Who?”
“Lanie,” I said again. “She’s usually here. Black hair, blonde streaks in the front. Kind of sarcastic? Beautiful?”
The barista glanced at the guy beside her, then back at me.
“I think you have the wrong café. No one named Lanie’s ever worked here.”
“No,” I said too quickly. “That’s not right. We’ve been here before. Together. We’ve sat at that table.” I pointed to the back corner by the window. “She always got black coffee, I got a mocha latte. We’ve talked here. Dozens of times.”
She gave me a cautious look. “Ma’am… you come in here a lot. But you’re always alone.”
The words felt like a slap.
I shook my head. “No. No, that’s not true. She was here with me. We—”
“We just thought maybe you were on the phone,” she added carefully, “or, like… talking to yourself.”
I felt my stomach drop. A cold rush of panic slid down my spine.
“You’re wrong,” I whispered. “She worked here. She was here.”
The barista’s eyes hardened. “If you don’t leave, we’ll have to call the cops.”
I didn’t remember the walk to the bookstore.
I just remember standing in front of the counter, the bell on the door still jingling behind me.
The older man behind the register looked up with a familiar tired smile.
“Hey there,” he said. “Back again already?”
I nodded stiffly. “Yeah. I was just wondering… do you remember a girl who used to come in here with me? Lanie?”
He blinked. “What?”
“Black hair, blonde streaks, leather jacket,” I said. “We used to sit by the horror section. She liked Shirley Jackson. I think you rang her up once—she bought a copy of House of Leaves.”
He frowned.
“I’m sorry, I don’t remember anyone like that. You usually come in alone. You sit on the floor by the far shelf for hours. Sometimes you hum. But I don’t remember you ever being with anyone.”
I couldn’t breathe.
The bookstore was closing in on me. The lights too bright. The walls too tight.
I turned and stumbled out the door, my vision blurring, the floor tilting beneath my feet.
Was I going crazy?
Had I made her up?
Every place we’d ever gone… every memory… all of it?
Gone.
Erased.
Like she never existed at all.

Chapter Nineteen
She’s finally awake

I was halfway down Fifth when the world tilted sideways.
One second I was walking, the next it was like the sky dropped an octave.
The streetlights flickered—buzzing so loudly it rattled my skull.
Cars froze mid-motion. Pedestrians stopped in their tracks, staring straight ahead like mannequins. A dog across the street lifted its head and let out a sharp, high-pitched howl—and then even it went still.
Everything paused.
I blinked and rubbed my eyes. Tried to breathe.
No one moved.
No one blinked.
Then the buzzing stopped—and so did my heart.
A splitting pain cracked through the center of my skull like lightning.
I stumbled. Tried to hold onto a mailbox. Missed.
And the world went black.
The room was white.
Not off-white. Not hospital white. Bleached. Blinding.
I blinked, vision hazy, pupils aching from the brightness.
The floor was smooth. Seamless. No doors. No windows. Just a single light above and the hum of something mechanical behind the walls.
I tried to sit up, but my arms felt heavy. Like I’d been drugged.
There were voices—muffled at first—whispering in a rhythm I couldn’t understand.
Then, like a needle slipping into place:
“She’s finally awake, my lord.”
I turned my head too fast. Pain lanced down my neck.
“My lord?” I rasped, voice cracked and unfamiliar.
“Where the fuck am I? Where is Lanie?”
Two figures stepped into view—clad in white from head to toe. No name tags. No expression. Their clothes looked sterile, ceremonial… not like scrubs. Like robes pretending to be medical garb.
They leaned over me, checking something by my wrist.
One of them was chanting softly, the syllables wrong—too many consonants. The other moved her fingers in slow circles above my skin like she was drawing symbols in the air.
I tried to pull my arm away, but my muscles refused.
I grabbed one of their arms anyway—barely—and managed to force her to look at me.
Her face was—
Wrong.
Distorted. Like I was seeing her underwater. Her eyes were too large, her mouth too wide. Her cheekbones too sharp and waxy. Something inside her skin twitched, like a heartbeat too close to the surface.
She leaned in close and smiled.
“Welcome home, Emily.”
Her voice was like rotted honey.
The other one moved closer.
“We’ve missed you,” she said gently.
The words were worse than screams.
I twisted, tried to break free, my breathing ragged. “Where am I? Where the hell is Lanie?”
Neither of them flinched.
“You’re safe now,” one said.
“You’re remembered,” said the other.
I screamed.
“I need to see her—I need to see her right now!”
They didn’t answer.
They just pressed their hands to my temples, whispered things that didn’t belong in any human language.
And behind their heads—behind the glaring light above me—I saw a shadow shift.
Someone else was in the room.
Watching.
Waiting.

Chapter Twenty
The missing piece has returned.

They brought me to the field at dawn.
The same one I had dreamed of. The one from the books. From the rituals. But this time… it was real.
I could feel the chill of dew soaking into my knees. The silence wasn’t empty—it was waiting.
The cult grounds stretched far and wide. A vast clearing of dead grass, patches of dark, upturned soil like something had clawed its way out. The sky was gray, soft and low, and in the distance stood the buildings I remembered from my nightmares: wood-rotted cabins with warped windows, a chapel without a cross, and a bell tower that never rang.
I didn’t know how I was standing.
My legs felt boneless, barely attached. Every step was a fight.
And then he spoke.
From the raised platform at the center of the field—a blackened altar framed by robed figures—he emerged.
The Lord.
His face was hidden beneath a thick hood. His voice sounded like it came from the bottom of the earth.
“The missing piece has returned,” he said.
“Emily Harper. Born of imbalance. Blood of consequence. You have wandered. You have betrayed. But now… you remember.”
I shook my head. “No—I don’t—this isn’t real—”
I tried to run. I got two steps before collapsing again.
My lungs burned. My vision blurred.
“You left your purpose behind,” the Lord continued, “but we have prepared your return. Everything you experienced—every love, every comfort, every illusion—was designed to bring you home.”
I screamed. Lanie’s name tore from my throat like a wound.
Nothing. No answer. No sign of her. Not even a trace.
Then—like a bolt of memory—I remembered the knife. The blood. My hands.
What I’d done.
“No…” I gasped. “No, no, no—Lanie—”
“Silence her,” the Lord commanded.
Several robed figures surrounded me. Cold hands grabbed my arms, my face. A thick cloth was shoved into my mouth, tied tight at the back of my head. My scream was cut off mid-breath.
I choked.
I sobbed.
I tried to fight them off but couldn’t move.
The chanting resumed. Their voices in unison, humming something low and unnatural.
The Lord raised his arms like a preacher and continued:
“From illusion, she will be reborn.
From forgetfulness, she will remember.
The mother is gone. The sister is gone.
But the daughter remains. The vessel endures.”
When the light faded, I found myself inside a cabin.
Not just any cabin—one from my dreams.
The inside smelled like old pine and damp dirt. A stove rested cold in the corner. The floorboards were uneven, warped with moisture. An old quilt lay over a splintered bedframe. There were cracks in the walls where light slithered through. Spiderwebs hugged the corners. And on the wooden table in front of me sat a notebook.
My notebook.
The same one I had in my apartment.
I reached for it with trembling fingers. The pages were blank.
Across from me, an older woman sat, her face pale and kind, but empty in the way nurses in bad dreams are.
She reached across the table and touched my wrist gently.
“Do you remember anything… while you were away?”
I couldn’t speak. I just stared.
“Write it down,” she said. “Everything you saw. Everything you felt. You’ll feel better once it’s on the page. You always do.”
I looked down at the pen.
I remembered Lanie’s smile. Her laugh. Her blonde streaks. The way she made me feel like I wasn’t disappearing.
But she wasn’t real.
None of it was.
The café. The apartment. My job. The nights we talked for hours.
It was all a veil.
A trap.
I never left the cult.
I had never escaped.
Everything had been fabricated to make me forget.
To erase my mother’s scream.
To erase my sister’s tiny, still body.
They made me forget them.
They made me forget who I was—so I could become what they needed me to be.
I picked up the pen.
And I began to write.

3:21am

I’m—
I don’t know where—

it smells like smoke again
or something burned
or someone

I thought the field was behind me
but I can still feel grass in my mouth

Lanie was—
no, is?
no.

My name is Emily Harper.
I was born in—
(where was it?)

I keep writing it down so I don’t forget
but it’s not helping
it’s not helping
it’s not helping

They said I chose this
but I don’t remember choosing anything

She had two blonde streaks in her hair
I remember that
I remember that

I had a sister
(didn’t I?)

Why do I only remember the scream
not the sound before it

STOP

They’re watching me write this
I don’t know if I’m allowed to know this much

The light in the hallway just flickered

The Lord said I was the missing piece

So why do I feel erased

If you find this

don’t
the handwriting’s not mine
except it is
except it’s hers.
lanie?
me?
i’m not wearing my hands today. they feel                    like  gloves. too big. too loud.
the walls are breathing again.
they’re whispering.
no—chanting.
or maybe it’s just the pipes.
maybe it’s just them.
i found dirt under my nails.
was i outside again?
was that today?
my notebook smells like smoke.
my pillow is wet.
i wrote “remember” seventeen times in the margin and i don’t remember writing it once.
THEY LIED
THEY LIED
THEY LIED
they took lanie
they took my name
they folded me inside a different girl
and i’ve been walking around wearing her like skin
my mother’s voice is in the air vents.
i asked her what happened
she told me to hush.
she told me “they’re still watching.”
i saw my sister last night.
she was standing at the foot of my bed with no eyes.
just teeth.
and that music again—the hum.
low and slow like breathing
like something waiting.
like something hungry.
stop reading this.
stop stop stop
they’ll smell the ink.
they’ll smell the truth.
i need to burn this.
i need to bury this.
i need to—
wait.

1mit4b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceOCs/comments/1mit4b6/specialist_fravashi_grace_howard/,"Specialist (Fravashi): Grace Howard, Engineer/Blacksmith of The Asher Pirates:","[Gear Tinkerer ](https://preview.redd.it/mqka5qjy6bhf1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68216d61346395e907e989f54ab74224978f8f8a)

Bio: An orphan raised on Forger’s Archipelago, Grace has always held a fascination with machines after hearing about the exploits of Dr.Vegapunk, which led to her joining the island's construction company with the aim of someday getting to meet her idol in the flesh. A prodigy in her field, Grace was on her way to becoming one of the top mechanics on the island, when the World Government arrived and declared that the island construction company would from now on; only make constructs that the World Government wanted. The head of the company she works for, a man Khors, refused to bend the knee to the Government, only for him to mysteriously disappear after heading off to a meeting with Government officials, with the company shortly after being taken over by the World Government. Now, Grace has to prove to her fellow workers and her adoptive sister, Koleda, that Khors didn’t just abandon them, and that the World Government simply wants to use their skills to make weapons. Thankfully, a certain group of pirates just so happen to be arriving, ones who like to stir up trouble for the WG.

Personality: A good-natured if somewhat eccentric young woman, Grace is known for being someone who once she gets a vision of a machine design in her head, she won’t rest until she gets a working version of it up and running. She’s a bit quirky and scatterbrain when it comes to anything other than her machines, her social skills being less than optimal but she makes up for that by being rather bubbly and friendly to pretty much every person she meets. Grace is loyal to a fault and expresses a great desire to help; offering assistance to the other members of the construction company, with said behavior translating towards the crew after she joins them. This trait of hers has led her to jokingly being called a “mom” by both the workers and her crew-mates, though Grace is oblivious to this moniker as nobody mentions it.

As an Engineer, builder and dismantler, Grace has a prodigious intelligence and was the head of the R&D department of the company, seemingly always coming up with new ideas for machines that she sometimes would overwork herself; the workers in her department having to come over and make sure that she’s getting enough rest. Her drive for innovation and improvement also makes her somewhat reckless when doing her job, as she’s willing to throw herself into danger if it means fixing a problem on one of the machines. However, she’s only reckless when it comes to her own well being, as Grace is unwilling to risk the life of other people if something is wrong with one of her machines, and takes full responsibility for any damages that come about as a result. For Grace, her machines are like children to her and that means that she always puts all of her effort into making sure that they run and function properly, as she wants to avoid any of her creations from hurting and possibly even killing innocent people, showing that her drive for improvement comes from a deep humanitarian desire.

Grace lost her parents at a young age, and having been taken in by Khors she has a great sense of loyalty to him, refusing to believe that he abandoned the island and sold them to the World Government, unlike her adoptive sister. Also, while she’s slow to anger, Grace can and will become passionately filled with rage when she sees others disregard their responsibilities towards their creations, as it shows to her that they don’t care if what they make hurts people. Her desire to create machines also leads her to wanting to meet Dr. Vegapunk, the most brilliant mind on the planet, having read so much about his projects that he’s basically become her idol in the fields of robotics. This is also despite the fact that she knows he’s involved with the World Government, the organization she hates for causing Khors’s death, staining his name with lies and trying to take over the company on her home island.

Physical Appearance: A young woman who is 24 years old and stands at 5’7 in height, Grace has a fair skin tone with black hair tied into a short ponytail; with two side bangs that reach to her shoulders, her eyes are a soft reddish-amber color and she has an athletically toned yet curvy figure with a well-endowed chest. Grace also has a blue tattoo of a twin gear, one smaller gear inside of a large gear, on her right shoulder. Her main outfit is made up of a front zipper shockproof sports bra vest, exposing her midriff, tight, form-fitting tactical pants with two belts, one gray and one white around her waist; metal knee pads on each pants leg and a pair of black and gray sneakers with orange vertical stripe on the side. She also wears a pair of goggles with squared orange lens on her forehead, has a wears a belt harness underneath her vest, two different sets of arms sleeves; the right one made of black cloth material that reaches to her shoulder and underneath the strap of her vest, while the left one is made of black mesh material and reaches only to her above her bicep, along with a pair of different colored finger-less gloves, white for her right hand and black for the left and a white cape-like garment with a ring design at the ends hangs of her waist; reaching down above her ankles. Grace also has an assortment of pouches, one on the right strap of her vest, another two attached to the back of the harness underneath said vest, a white pouch on her arm below her shoulder, three hanging off the belt on the left side of her waist, and another hanging off the right sleeve of the white garment around her waist. She also has three grenades on belt on the right hip side, with another three hanging off a black belt connected to her white one; said belt having ammo clips for her nail gun attached to it as well.

Devil Fruit: None  
Fighting Style: Grace is a Gadget Fighter. Quick on her feet and capable of making leaps with the grace of a trained gymnast, Grace wields a variety of tools in her numerous pouches and in the satchel she wears for. Her main piece of weaponry comes in the form of a nail gun with a modular weapon system, allowing her to switch out certain parts of the gun for others, granting it different capabilities based on what Grace needs for certain occasions. She also carries a variety of grenades in her pouches, ranging from electric types, to ones capable of ensnaring her targets, and to even one capable of emanating a powerful flash and sound that stun her enemies. The goggles she wears on her head are also very useful, as they allow her to see from farther distance and have an infrared mode to them as well, helping her to fight by tracking enemy body heat.  
Weapon: A souped-up nail gun, and a variety of different kinds of grenades.  
Haki: Observation and Armament  
Bounty: 18,033,000 Berries/35,900,000 Berries  
Favorite Food: Sandwiches and Coffee  
Recruitment: 15th member to join.  
Dream: “To meet Dr.Vegapunk and create Machines that can think for themselves!”

(And now we have the third Character from ZZZ as a member of my crew, and can I just say, figuring out how to describe every single bit of Grace's outfit: Literal. Nightmare. It took me so long, I had to look through so many clothing descriptions and phrases for them, even then I feel like I still got some wrong, but I gave it my best shot and that's I all I could ask for. But yeah, I've always enjoy Grace character, she quirky and interesting and I just figured she make a great addition to the crew. Not to mention that her interest in Vegapunk would inherently create a plot point for the my crew to meet the guy, so that also helps out.)  
Well, 12 out of 20 down, 8 more to go! Next up with be another original character by me, the Resident Three-Eye tribe member of the crew. You'll see them tomorrow, so look forward for that tomorrow!",1,1754448157.0,OnePieceOCs,0,1.0,False

chapter seven
Late Hours 

I stayed after six.

But just after—around 6:15—Jay passed by my desk on his way out. His keys jingled in one hand, blazer slung over his shoulder like always. He paused when he saw me still typing, his brow lifting with quiet surprise.

“Emily,” he said. “You’re still here?”

I didn’t look up from my screen. “Just making up the work from today.”

He stepped closer, folding his arms in a way that meant concerned boss mode was kicking in.

“You know you don’t have to push yourself like this. You’re already my best. If something’s going on… we can talk.”

I forced a quick smile. “I’m fine. Just a weird week.”

Jay studied me for a second. He wasn’t a prying type, but he wasn’t blind either. Eventually, he nodded.

“Well, don’t stay too late. I’ll leave the lights on this floor for another hour. Lock up when you’re done.”

“Thanks, Jay.”

He gave me one last look before walking off, footsteps echoing down the hallway, fading into the quiet. Then the elevator chimed and he was gone.

But I stayed.

I had to.

I’ve never been the kind of person who falls behind. Never needed reminders or make-up work or sympathy. But now, everything felt off-kilter—like my life had shifted a few degrees sideways. Sleep-deprived days. Lingering fear. Memories crawling back that weren’t mine, or maybe were.

I needed to get back to normal.

Before the dreams.
Before the whispers and shadows.
Before the word cult stopped sounding absurd.

So I worked. I buried myself in numbers, forms, claim notes. I let the structure of it cradle me like rails on a track. If I just kept moving forward, maybe I wouldn’t fall apart.

The rest of the office dimmed slowly. Lights clicked off section by section. Chairs sat empty. Cubicles like grave markers.

The building was nearly silent, save for the occasional hum of the air vents cycling stale air through the ducts. Fluorescent lights buzzed low above me as I finished typing my final notes—sharp clicks echoing louder than they should in the empty space. Everyone had gone home. No printer whirring, no phones ringing, no footsteps on the carpeted floor.

The insurance office felt wrong after hours.

Cold.

Deserted.

Rows of cubicles stretched ahead like abandoned cages—computer monitors blank, chairs turned in slightly different angles, water bottles left half-full on desks like forgotten offerings. The breakroom, visible through the frosted glass wall, sat dark except for the red light on the microwave clock, blinking 6:42… 6:43… over and over like a pulse.

I shut down my computer, gathered my things, and stood slowly. The silence pressed in on my ears. The kind of silence that wasn’t empty—but watchful. Like the building was holding its breath.

I stepped into the hallway, lights flickering in soft clusters above. Most were off completely now, casting the carpet in long stretches of shadow broken only by faint, yellow-tinted emergency lights along the walls.

That’s when I saw it.

At the very end of the corridor.

A figure.

Motionless. Standing beneath the dim glow of the exit sign.

It wasn’t doing anything—just existing. The shape of a person, tall, shoulders slightly hunched forward, arms at its sides. Too far to make out a face. No sound. No breath. Just the presence of someone—or something—that shouldn’t be there.

I froze. For a heartbeat, I couldn’t tell if I was fully awake.

Was this another dream?

My feet started forward before I made the decision to move, almost like I’d been pulled. One cautious step. Another.

Then—
My phone rang.

Sharp and sudden, vibrating in my coat pocket with a high, electronic trill.

I startled, my eyes flicking down to the glowing screen.

Lanie.

And when I looked back up…

The figure was gone.

Just shadows and empty carpet now. A faint creak in the air vents. The exit sign still blinking, steady and innocent. But the hallway was empty.

I swallowed hard and answered the call. “Hello?”

“Hey,” Lanie said, voice warm but quiet. “Everything okay? I’ve texted a few times.”

I glanced at my notifications. Five unread messages.

“Sorry,” I murmured. “Work got crazy. I stayed late to catch up. I think I just need to get home and crash.”

“You sure?” she asked. “You sound… weird. I mean, more than usual.”

I tried to laugh. It came out thin.

“Want to get dinner?” she offered. “Or—I could come over. I make a killer grilled cheese when I’m trying to impress people.”

The thought of going home alone—of walking into my apartment, locking the door behind me, and sitting in that too-still silence—felt unbearable.

“Yeah,” I said. “Actually… that sounds really nice.”

“On my way,” she said without hesitation. “You like tomato soup?”

“I do now.”

We hung up.

I stood there a moment longer, still staring down the hallway.

There was nothing there.

Nothing at all.

And yet, as I turned toward the elevator, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d almost seen something I wasn’t supposed to.

That I’d almost gotten too close.

i woke up with it again—
walls breathing
furniture wrong moved
everything wrong off

it was here.
i think.
maybe.

the hallway kept going.
too long for this building
too long for any building
it bent. it breathed.

why was the wallpaper bleeding
or was it just—
just red.

letters
scrawled across the seams—
“You were always meant for this.”
no no no
that’s not mine
i didn’t write that
i didn’t write that

someone behind the wall
knew my name
whispered it like
like a prayer or a punishment

don’t follow the humming
don’t open the third door
don’t look at their faces
don’t look at their faces
DON’T LOOK AT THEIR FACES

Lanie
Lanie was there
but not her
not the real her
the version with no mouth
just eyes
dark dark dark

she tried to speak
but her teeth were bleeding
and when she reached for me
her hands were burned

she keeps pulling away
won’t answer my calls
won’t meet my eyes
not since i asked about the white room

she’s scared
she knows something’s changing
i’m changing
maybe she already knew

she said i was lucky to forget
but what if
what if she’s the one who made me forget?
what if she brought me back on purpose?

did she come to find me—
or to finish what they started?

they came in threes
they always came in threes
they took the third
took her sister
took
mine?
i didn’t have a sister

there was blood on my hands
when i woke up
or ink

like keys
like knives
like coins on a dead tongue

i saw it again today
i think
no. i know
by the breakroom
too tall
no face
no eyes but it saw me
it knew me

what if this isn’t dreaming
what if this is
remembering
what if i didn’t forget
what if i was taught to forget
like Lanie said

she’s slipping
she’s lying
or protecting me
or using me
i don’t know anymore

am i the third

they said i was the one
i don’t want it
i don’t want it

i don’t want it i don’t want it i don’t want it

chapter eight 
The Pulling

The days bleed.

They don’t pass normally anymore—they seep, smudge, overlap. I wake up unsure what day it is, what time it’s supposed to be, what I was doing before the world turned sideways again.

Yesterday, I walked to work with two mismatched shoes. One boot, one sneaker.

I didn’t notice until I sat down at my desk.

Everything feels like that now. Close to right, but off. Warped. Like I’ve slipped into a copy of my life and can’t find the edges to tear through.

At work, I stare at screens that change without my input. I answer emails twice. Sometimes three times. Once, I found an entire document in my drafts—written in my voice but not mine. It was about “the reckoning” and “the return” and “balance through the third.” I deleted it. Emptied the trash. But it still shows up in my recent files. Every day. Like it’s waiting for me.

And Jay—my boss—has started watching me more closely. The kind of glances you try to pretend you don’t notice.

It was late in the afternoon when he finally stopped by my desk.

I was halfway through editing the same paragraph for the fourth time. I think I kept rearranging the same three words, convinced something wasn’t right. I didn’t even notice him standing there until he cleared his throat.

“Emily.”

I looked up too fast, blinking like I’d just been caught stealing.

“Hey, Jay. I’m just… finishing up a few things.”

He looked at me for a long moment. Not annoyed. Not angry. Just… concerned. That made it worse somehow.

“You’ve been here late every night this week,” he said.

I gave a weak smile. “Just trying to catch up is all.”

He nodded slowly, but his eyes didn’t leave mine. I realized, too late, that I probably looked like hell. Pale. Sleep-deprived. My clothes wrinkled, my hair pulled back with little care.

“Emily,” he said carefully, “I need you to take a few days off.”

I frowned. “I’m fine.”

“You’re not,” he said gently, but firmly. “Take the time. Get some rest. Recharge.”

“I don’t need—”

Jay held up a hand. “It’s not a request. It’s a requirement. Just a few days. You’ll still get paid. Use your PTO time.”

I sat back, blinking. I didn’t know what to say. My chest tightened. I hated the idea of stepping away—of being alone for longer than I already was.

“I’m okay,” I tried again. “Really.”

“You’re exhausted. And honestly? You’re starting to scare people a little.”

The words landed hard. They weren’t cruel, but they were honest.

“I’m not firing you, Emily. I’m just asking you to take care of yourself.”

I swallowed hard and nodded, slowly. “Okay.”

“Good.” He exhaled. “You’ll be better for it.”

I didn’t believe him.

That night, I went home and stared at the ceiling until the shadows moved. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t even try. I called Lanie instead.

Her voice on the other end of the line was soft. Thin.

“Hello?”

“Can I come over?” I asked. “Please?”

A pause.

Then: “Yeah. Yeah, of course.”

Her apartment used to feel warm—jungle plants, incense, thrifted mugs. A little chaotic, but safe.

Now? Now it’s empty in all the wrong places.

The air smelled sour and sweet, like vanilla rotting. The blinds were drawn tight, the walls dim. Most of her plants were dying—slumped in their pots, leaves spotted and brittle. I hadn’t even realized how quiet it was until I stepped inside. No kettle. No hum of music. Just the low sound of her pacing.

She was pale. Her eyes were darker than usual—shadowed. There was something on her sleeve, dried and rust-colored.

“Lanie,” I said, my voice already trembling, “talk to me.”

She kept pacing, mumbling something under her breath.

And then—barely above a whisper:

“They want you back.”

My stomach dropped.

I stood frozen for a second too long, the words ringing in my ears like a bell.

“…What did you just say?” I whispered.

She turned to me, startled, eyes wide like I’d slapped her.

“I didn’t say anything,” she said quickly. “Emmy… are you okay?”

“You did,” I said. “You said they want me back.”

“No. I swear I didn’t. You’re just… you’re tired. You’ve been dreaming again, haven’t you?”

I stared at her, something creeping into my chest that I didn’t have a name for.

“I’m not dreaming when I’m awake.”

She looked away.

“You’ve been remembering things that didn’t happen,” she said. “The stories I told you—they’re leaking in.”

“No,” I said. “That’s not it. I know these things.”

“You need rest,” she said again. “You need to stop digging.”

“I think I already did. I think this is what was buried.”

She said nothing.

But her silence said everything.

And when I finally fell asleep that night—

I didn’t dream.
I remembered.

The woods.
The circle.
The white robes.
The crying child.
My hands.
The bowl.
The phrase—

“You were always meant for this.”

The words tumbled out of my mouth like a prayer I’d said before.

And I knew the child.
I knew her.

And when I woke up,
the dirt on my sheets told me I’d brought something back with me.

And I wasn’t sure I was ever going to sleep again.


Chapter Nine
the unrecognizable 

I didn’t mean to fall asleep again.
One moment I was sitting on the edge of the bed, blinking too slow, Lanie’s soft voice drifting from the kitchen — and the next, everything was gone. Time folded in on itself. The air shifted.
When I opened my eyes, it was quiet.
Too quiet.
No hum from the fridge. No traffic outside. Just stillness, like the whole apartment was holding its breath.
Then—
“Emmy?” A hand touched my shoulder. Warm, firm. “Hey, sleepyhead.”
I jerked upright.
Lanie stood over me, eyes soft, holding a chipped black mug in one hand.
“You okay?” she asked. “Didn’t mean to scare you. I just brought you some coffee.”
My heart was racing, skin clammy against the sheets. “What time is it?”
“A little after ten.”
“Morning?”
She smiled. “Yeah. You slept like the dead.”
My throat was dry. “I didn’t mean to. I was just resting my eyes.”
“You always say that,” she teased, handing me the mug. “You fall asleep like a cat in a sunbeam. Blink and you’re gone.”
I stared into the coffee. It was dark and fragrant, a soft swirl of cream curling through it like smoke. Something about it felt… off. But I didn’t say that.
Lanie sat at the edge of the bed beside me, tucking one leg beneath her.
“You dream?” she asked gently.
I hesitated. “I think so. But I don’t remember what.”
“Maybe that’s for the best.”
I looked over at her, unsure. “Why would that be better?”
Lanie’s smile was faint, distant. “Some dreams aren’t dreams. They’re pieces. Fragments trying to float to the surface. And sometimes it’s better to let them stay buried. Until you’re ready.
When I finally stood and looked at the bed again, I froze.
The dirt was gone.
Not smeared. Not scattered. Not shifted around like someone had tried to clean it. Gone. Completely.
The sheets were smooth and pale, tucked perfectly beneath the mattress.
I stared, breath caught in my throat. My pulse thudded at my temples.
Lanie followed my gaze. “What is it?”
“There was dirt,” I said quietly. “Right there. Under the covers. When I woke up last night.”
She blinked. “Dirt?”
I nodded. “Dark. Like soil. And it smelled like—like outside. Like rot.”
Lanie moved closer. “Are you sure?”
“Yes.” My voice cracked. “I touched it. I felt it.”
She looked at the bed, then back at me, her expression unreadable. “Emmy… there’s nothing there now.”
“I know,” I said. “But it was. I swear—”
“You were exhausted last night. You could’ve been dreaming with your eyes open. You’ve done that before.”
“I’m not—” I stopped myself, fists clenched at my sides. “I’m not imagining things.”
Lanie reached for my hand. “I didn’t say you were.”
“But you think I made it up.”
“No,” she said, squeezing gently. “I think your mind is trying to show you something, and maybe you’re not ready to see the whole thing yet. That doesn’t mean it’s not real.”
I pulled my hand back. “I hate that. I hate not knowing what’s real.”
“I know you do.”
“I feel like I’m going crazy.”
“You’re not.”
I sat back down on the bed, rubbing my face. “I just want to trust what I see. What I remember.”
She was quiet for a moment, then said softly, “What if what you remember… isn’t the whole truth?”
Later, in the bathroom, I stared into the mirror again.
The skin beneath my eyes looked even darker now, as if the sleep had only made me more tired. The bruise on my neck was still there. Fainter than before. But real.
I reached up and touched it.
The moment I did, something flickered. A voice — soft and cold — brushed the edge of my memory:
“Three for balance. One for fire.”
My knees nearly gave out.
I didn’t tell Lanie.
Not about the bruise. Or the voice. Or the reflection that seemed a half-second too slow.
She handed me a second mug of tea when I came back out, a rich red color this time. Steam drifted lazily upward.
“Chamomile,” she said. “You’ve been tense.”
“I’m fine.”
“Emmy,” she said, tilting her head, “you don’t have to act okay for me. You never have.”
“I’m fine.” But my fingers trembled around the handle.
We sat on the couch. The TV was on, low volume, some old movie playing in the background. I wasn’t really watching. My eyes kept drifting toward the coat closet.
There was a padlock on it now.
Had that been there yesterday?
“You cold?” Lanie asked, brushing a strand of hair from my face.
I shook my head. “No.”
“You’re quiet.”
“I’m tired.”
She leaned her head on my shoulder. “Do you remember the first time we talked?”
I paused. “At the coffee shop.”
“Yeah, but do you remember it? What I was wearing? What you said?”
I frowned. “You were in black. I think.”
“Everyone wears black in the fall,” she said gently.
I tried again. “You made me a drink I didn’t order. Told me it was something I needed.”
“That part’s true,” she said, smiling faintly. “You didn’t even question it.”
“I should have.”
Lanie sat up a little straighter. “Do you trust me, Emily?”
The question caught me off guard.
“I don’t know.”
“That’s honest.”
“Do you trust me?”
“Of course,” she said. “I think you just don’t trust yourself yet. But you will.”
Later that night, after Lanie stepped outside to make a call, I returned to the bathroom.
I locked the door behind me.
The mark on my neck was darker now. A ring of bruised skin. And at the center — not just an indentation, but a shape.
A circle, with a line through it. Familiar in a way that made my stomach turn.
I leaned closer.
This time, my reflection smiled at me.
And I didn’t.

Chapter Ten
Research

I left that night.
I didn’t say much — just told Lanie I needed air, that I’d sleep better in my own bed. She looked like she wanted to argue, to follow, maybe even to hold onto me for a second longer.
But she didn’t.
She just stood in the doorway as I walked down the hall, arms folded across her chest, the light from her apartment pooling behind her like a stage.
“Text me when you get there,” she said.
I nodded.
I didn’t look back.
The streets were quiet. The air heavy, still clinging to the warmth of the day. My shoes echoed on the sidewalk as I walked, and the shadows between the buildings seemed deeper than usual.
I kept glancing over my shoulder, unsure what I expected to see.
Something.
Someone.
But there was nothing.
Just me and my reflection in dark windows.
And the mark on my neck.
When I stepped into my apartment, the first thing I did was lock the door. Then I locked it again.
The silence inside hit harder than I expected. It wasn’t peaceful. It was hollow.
Like the apartment hadn’t missed me.
Like it barely remembered I lived there.
I flipped on the lights. Everything was exactly how I left it. My worn-out sneakers by the door. A dish in the sink. The lamp still flickering slightly from a bad bulb.
But it all felt off.
I ran a hand through my hair and dropped onto the couch, notebook in my lap. I opened to the last page I’d written and stared.
the dirt wasn’t real
reflection blinked late
voice: three for balance, one for fire
ask lanie if they ever mark people
And under that, scribbled in darker ink:
the dreams started after lanie told me about the restoration
I stared at that last line, heart thudding.
It was true. Before she told me about the cult, I hadn’t dreamed anything.
No strange symbols.
No black soil.
No marks on my skin.
What if knowing wasn’t the problem?
What if remembering was?
Sleep didn’t come easy.
I kept the light on. Laid in bed fully dressed, notebook beside me, pen clutched in my fist.
But no dreams came. Just the hum of the refrigerator through the wall and the phantom echo of my own heartbeat.
By the time the sun cracked the horizon, I already knew what I was going to do.
At 8:34 AM, I texted Lanie:

you busy? -E
never for you - L
what’s going on? -L
i want to look into the restoration -E
meet me at the library. 11. -E
okay -L
you sure? -L
no -E
come anyway -E

We met outside the old brick library near the river.
Lanie was already waiting when I got there, perched on the steps in an oversized hoodie and ripped jeans, hair tied up in a messy bun. She looked younger somehow, like the version of her that first handed me a coffee I didn’t ask for.
“You’re up early,” she said, standing.
“I never really went to sleep.”
“Same.”
We didn’t say much as we walked inside.
The library was cold and quiet, the kind of place that smelled like damp paper and forgotten time. It took a while to get access to the archive room, but once we were in, it felt like a different world — yellowed newspaper clippings, dusty microfiche reels, and stacks of uncatalogued local history books.
Lanie took the digital end — computers and public records. I started on the physical files, scanning for any mention of The Restoration.
Most of it was garbage. Ghost stories. Message board rants from the late ‘90s. Articles too vague to lead anywhere. But then Lanie appeared behind me with a few printouts in her hands.
“I found something,” she said, sliding a page onto the table.
A newspaper scan. Local paper. Dated 1998.
LOCAL FARM RAIDED — AUTHORITIES REMOVE THREE CHILDREN FROM ‘ISOLATED SPIRITUAL COMMUNITY’
I sat up straighter.
Lanie tapped the margin. “Edgehill. It’s a tiny town. Hour west of here.”
I read the piece.
The article described a “rural religious collective” — no name mentioned, but language eerily similar to what Lanie had told me: group rituals, third-child births, forced seclusion, education through scripture only.
And one line buried in the second paragraph:
“…local residents referred to the group as ‘The Restoration.’”
My blood went cold.
“They’re real,” I whispered.
“I told you,” Lanie said softly.
I looked up at her. “That’s where your mother was from?”
She nodded once.
“I thought they all disappeared.”
“They did,” she said. “But not before leaving pieces behind.”
We kept going.
As the afternoon wore on, we found more.
Mentions in old fringe magazines. A burned pamphlet scanned onto a conspiracy blog. And finally, a grainy photo of a carved wooden sign half-covered by moss:
THE RESTORATION HOUSE OF LIGHT
Below it, etched into the wood, was a strange symbol.
A circle split by a vertical line.
I felt my fingers drift to my neck.
Lanie noticed.
“They called it the Binding Mark,” she said. “Anyone marked was considered… part of the prophecy. A vessel. Or a key.”
“A key to what?”
She didn’t answer. Not right away.
When she finally spoke, her voice was low. Almost afraid.
“Not everyone was meant to live through it.”
I stared down at the symbol. The grainy photo. The circle.
And the line.
Same shape.
Same spot.
Same pressure on my skin, right at the base of my throat.
“Lanie,” I said slowly, “how did they mark people?”
She didn’t flinch.
“They waited until you couldn’t fight it. Until you were asleep. Or worse.”
The library light flickered above us. A bulb buzzed. Somewhere down the aisle, a cart creaked slowly along the floor — but no one was there.
I swallowed hard.
“Then we keep going,” I said.
Lanie’s eyes searched mine. “Even if you don’t like what you find?”
“I have to find it.”

Chapter Eleven  
coming together 

The librarian gave me a look when I brought the stack to the counter — books on fringe religions, historical cults, symbolism in rural America. One even had a hand-drawn circle with a line through it on the spine.
I didn’t care. I checked them out, stuffed them into my tote, and followed Lanie out the door.
We didn’t talk much on the way to the car. Something about what we’d seen — the articles, the mark, that word vessel — had left both of us quiet.
“Text me if you find anything else,” Lanie said, hand on the door.
“I will.”
“You okay?”
I nodded. But I wasn’t sure if it was true.
Back at my apartment, I kicked off my shoes and dumped the books onto the coffee table. The apartment was too quiet again, the air too still. I left the door unlocked this time, not because I felt safe — but because I didn’t want to be trapped.
I flipped through one of the books at random, something about Appalachian cults and messianic offshoots. Pages crinkled under my fingers, dry and yellowed at the edges. I scanned words without absorbing them.
Third-born. Ritual fire. Devotion. Cleansing.
The same phrases repeated, always with slight variations, like the meaning kept shifting just out of reach.
Eventually, my head started to nod.
I didn’t mean to fall asleep.
The dream didn’t feel like a dream.
It began with silence.
But not the peaceful kind — the kind right before something awful happens.
I stood in a clearing. My feet were bare, buried ankle-deep in dark, cold mud. The trees loomed unnaturally tall, bark blackened and pulsing like breathing skin. The sky overhead was a mess of ash and bruised clouds, swirling without wind.
A massive fire blazed in the center of the clearing, but it gave off no warmth.
Figures circled it.
All in white robes.
All facing inward.
Some wore animal masks — crude and snarling: deer, fox, wolf, horse — stretched tight over human faces, stitched with red thread. One of them turned slightly, and I saw a human mouth underneath the snout, wide and grinning, teeth filed to sharp points.
Their movements were jerky.
Too fast, then too slow.
Like time was folding in on itself.
The fire crackled, and from within it came a sound like screaming children — but in reverse.
The figures began to chant. Words I didn’t understand, yet somehow recognized. The syllables twisted inside my ears, sticky and wet, like they weren’t meant for mouths.
In the center of the circle stood a little girl.
Barefoot. Red-haired.
It was me.
Maybe eight years old.
Eyes glassy. Skin pale. Blank-faced.
She didn’t look afraid.
She looked empty.
Two of the masked figures stepped forward — holding a burlap sack that writhed like something was trapped inside. They opened it and pulled out what looked like a rabbit. Then a chicken. Then something I couldn’t name.
Each one was laid at the child’s feet. Still alive. Still twitching.
Blood pooled in the dirt.
Then the chanting stopped.
The leader stepped forward — hooded, face fully covered. Taller than the others. In one hand, he held a branding iron.
The same symbol.
A circle.
A vertical line through the center.
It glowed orange. Hissed like a snake.
I tried to scream, but my voice was gone. My feet were frozen.
The man approached the child — me — and lifted the iron.
“You are the third,” he said in a voice that vibrated through the bones in my chest.
“You are the key.”
He pressed the brand to the child’s throat.
A violent sizzle, a flash of blinding light — and then she turned.
The younger version of me looked straight at me.
Her eyes were hollow.
“You let them do this,” she whispered. “You watched.”
The shadows behind the figures exploded outward — black limbs, too many eyes, open mouths gasping silently — and the entire circle collapsed inward.
Into fire.
Into me.
I jolted awake with a full-body gasp.
My shirt was soaked. My arms were trembling.
The book I’d been reading had fallen to the floor, splayed open on a section about ritual markings in backwoods communities. But something was different.
There was writing in the margin.
Handwritten.
“Restoration Grounds – Route 12, Edgehill. Past the old sawmill. Turn where the fence is broken.”
The ink was smudged. Uneven. Not printed.
And it looked like my handwriting.
But I hadn’t written it.
Not while I was awake.
I stared at it, the letters almost pulsing on the page. A buzzing sound crawled inside my ears.
Something was pulling me.
I didn’t hesitate.
The drive was quiet.
The sky had gone fully black by the time I passed the edge of town. The road stretched into nothing — long, cracked pavement that narrowed the deeper I went.
The sawmill came up on the right — collapsed roof, windows gone. A massive fence, twisted and half-swallowed by trees, stood just beyond.
There was a break in the wire.
Exactly where the book said.
No lights. No birds. No wind.

Chapter Twelve
Arriving 

The road narrowed the deeper I went.
First pavement. Then gravel. Then dirt. My tires crunched over broken stones and fallen leaves, the trees closing in on either side like they were slowly swallowing the road whole.
Fog crept in from nowhere, thick and low. My headlights barely cut through it. The darkness beyond was absolute.
My phone buzzed in the passenger seat.
Lanie.
I didn’t answer.
Buzz.
Buzz.
Pause.
Buzz.
I clenched the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles pale. I didn’t want to hear her voice. Not yet. Not while everything in me was being pulled forward like a rope tied to something just out of view.
Something waiting.
The wind shifted. My ears popped like the elevation had changed. The forest grew silent.
Buzz. Buzz. Buzz.
Lanie.
Again.
Finally, I picked up the phone and turned it over, ready to silence it for good.
But then I saw the text:
“Please Emily. Pick up. Please don’t go there.”
My chest tightened. I stared at the screen as the dirt road curved, trees warping in my peripheral vision. I didn’t slow down.
Another call came in.
I let it ring twice. Then pressed accept.
Held the phone to my ear.
Said nothing.
“Emily?” Lanie’s voice cracked on the second syllable. “Are you—where are you?”
Silence stretched between us like a frayed wire.
“I found it,” I said finally. My voice sounded distant. Not like me.
Lanie inhaled sharply. “No. No, Emily, please. Please tell me you’re not there.”
“I found the address in the book.”
“You—You read it? That wasn’t meant for you, Emmy, you weren’t supposed to go alone—” Her words came fast, tangled with panic.
“I needed to see it. I needed to know.”
“No, you don’t. You think you do, but you don’t understand. You don’t remember.”
I pulled the car to a stop just past a crumbling wooden post. A gate long fallen. The trees here were bent unnaturally. The grass had died in strange shapes — spirals, perfect circles, like the ground itself had been scorched by meaning.
“I’m here,” I said.
On the other end, Lanie made a sound. A sharp, broken sob that punched straight through the speaker.
“Please come back,” she whispered. “Please, Emily. I should’ve told you more, I didn’t think it would start again—”
I opened the car door. Cold air rushed in, smelling of damp soil and old smoke.
“What do you mean start again?”
Lanie was crying now. Full, raw, helpless. “You don’t remember what they did to you. What you were. You think this started when I told you—but it didn’t. It started when you were born. You were part of them, Emmy. You were one of them.”
My whole body went still.
“I can’t let you go back in there,” she said. “It’ll take you. It’ll finish what it started.”
I looked past the trees.
There was something up ahead.
A path.
A clearing.
The dream came rushing back in flashes—hooded figures, firelight, the brand—
My younger self looking at me with hollow eyes.
“You let them do this.”
“I have to know,” I whispered.
“No—Emily, wait—”
I ended the call.
Slipped the phone into my pocket.
And stepped into the dark.

Chapter Thirteen
The Restoration Grounds

The path narrowed the farther I walked.
Weeds grew in thick snarls that pulled at my jeans, thorns dragging against my ankles like fingers. The trees leaned unnaturally inward, their branches gnarled into twisted shapes, some split open like wounds. Moss coated their trunks, thick and spongy under my touch, and in the quiet, I could hear water dripping from leaf to leaf — slow, rhythmic, like a clock counting down.
There was no wind.
No birds. No insects.
Only silence.
And the feeling of being watched.
I stepped over a sun-bleached bone — something small, animal, maybe — and didn’t let myself look too long. Every instinct in me screamed to turn back, but I kept walking.
The trees broke open like a seam being torn, and I stepped into the clearing.
The earth was wrong here.
A wide field stretched out before me, but it wasn’t overgrown like the forest — it was barren. Dead. The soil was pale, grayish, almost ashy, and split open in deep cracks like it hadn’t seen water in years. No grass. No weeds. No sound.
Just emptiness.
Like something had scoured this place clean.
In the distance stood the remains of a structure — what must have once been the cult’s gathering place. It was larger than I expected. A rectangular chapel, tall and narrow, but completely decayed. The roof had caved in on one side, exposing the ribcage of rafters inside. Its wooden slats were waterlogged and warped, the white paint peeling like skin from a sunburn.
A crude cross still hung over the door, but it was crooked, the nails rusted to nothing. One shutter banged slowly against the siding, even though there was no breeze.
To the left of the building was a stone circle, just like the one in my dream. Seven flat stones arranged in a near-perfect ring, the center scorched black. Bits of melted wax pooled at the base of one. Ash stained the edges.
Behind it, scattered throughout the field like a forest of warnings, were rows of wooden stakes. Hundreds of them. Some broken. Some upright. A few still had rope tied near the top, knotted and frayed, swinging slightly as though disturbed by breath rather than wind.
To the right of the chapel, there was what might once have been a garden — but now it was a lifeless grid. Neatly divided plots of nothing. The earth too hard to have grown anything in years. No flowers. No crops. Just dry, sunken rectangles full of dust.
And it was all… quiet.
Too quiet.
The kind of silence that feels hollow. Empty. Like it’s been manufactured — not a lack of sound, but the removal of it.
I took a step forward.
Then another.
The air felt heavier here. Charged. Like the moment before a lightning strike.
Something rustled behind me.
I turned — fast.
A figure sprinted from the tree line.
I didn’t move.
Couldn’t.
The person — if it was a person — ran straight toward me, barefoot and frantic. Their robes hung off their frame like soaked cloth, streaked with dirt and blood. Their skin was gray, almost translucent in the light, and their mouth hung open but made no sound.
They stopped inches from me.
Too close.
The figure stared deep into my eyes, wide and unblinking.
His irises were clouded over, like cataracts — but still alert, like he could see through me. He smelled of rot and smoke. Like something unearthed.
He raised a trembling finger.
And pointed directly at my throat.
I froze.
Pain exploded beneath my jaw — sharp, instant, searing like a brand pressed to skin. My hand flew up, grasping at my neck. But there was no wound I could feel.
Just pain.
It bloomed outward like fire. My legs gave out.
I hit the ground hard, knees digging into the cracked earth. Dust rose in a small plume around me. The man just stood there, still pointing, head tilting slightly like he was studying a specimen.
And then he smiled.
It was wrong. Crooked. Lips splitting at the corners.
I gasped. The air felt thick, impossible to swallow.
I looked up at the sky — and realized the clouds weren’t moving. Nothing was. It was like time had stopped.
My vision blurred.
The chapel pulsed in the corner of my eye, the way things do in dreams right before they collapse into nightmares.
And then—
Darkness took me.
Like a curtain being drawn.

Journal Entry 

November 25, 2018   
Emily Harper

I’ve never been very good at describing myself.
It always feels like I’m talking about someone else—someone I used to know, or maybe someone I made up.
The way you might recall a dream you’re not sure you actually had.
Familiar in flashes. Gone the moment you try too hard to hold on.

I have red hair. Auburn, really.
It catches the light when the sun hits just right—burnished copper in summer, deeper and darker in the colder months, like rusted metal left out in the rain.
Most days, I wear it up. Twisted into a loose knot or pulled back with a tie I keep around my wrist.
It’s not about style. It’s habit.
Out of the way, out of mind.
Something about letting it fall around my shoulders feels too exposed, too… noticeable.

My skin is pale—almost translucent in some light.
I freckle easily. Always have.
There’s a scatter of them across my nose, my cheeks, the tops of my shoulders. I used to hate them.
When I was younger, I tried to scrub them away with lemon juice, like someone told me once in a magazine.
Now they feel like old ink blots.
Faint stains from a summer I don’t remember, like someone else lived it for me and left their proof behind.

I’m not very tall. Not very anything, really.
Just small in that way that makes people lower their voice around me, like I might break if they speak too loudly.
I don’t wear makeup. Not because I have anything against it—I just never learned how.
It always felt like painting over a face I don’t recognize.

I wear soft clothes.
Muted colors, nothing bright.
Cardigans with stretched cuffs, jeans that have been washed too many times, shoes that don’t make noise when I walk.
I like layers. They feel safe, like armor disguised as comfort.
I gravitate toward the kinds of things that blend into the background. The kinds of things that don’t ask to be noticed.

My eyes are a pale gray-blue.
Some days they look lighter.
Some days they look hollow.
I’ve caught my own reflection before and felt a split second of alarm—
like seeing a stranger mimic me from the other side of the glass.

People think I’m quiet. Polite.
Some call it calm.
Some call it soft.
But I think it’s just a stillness I’ve learned to live inside.
Like water in a glass held very still, afraid to spill.

There are parts of me I know I’ve lost.
Whole stretches of time that feel thin and worn, like an old bedsheet rubbed nearly transparent.
I’ve forgotten things.
Not little things—
Big things.
Pieces of who I was. What I felt. What happened.

So I write things down.

Not just important things like bills or deadlines or birthdays.
Everything.
What I wore. What I ate.
What I dreamed.
What song was playing when I woke up.
The shape of the clouds on my walk to work.
How I felt when I saw her—
Lanie.
Even if I’m afraid to admit it.

Because if I don’t write it down, it fades.
Some days feel like they never happened at all.
I can go back through my journals and see whole afternoons I wouldn’t remember otherwise.
I can track how the light changes in my apartment from month to month.
I can remember that I smiled, once, at something small.
Even if I don’t know why anymore.

There’s so much I’ve already lost.
Not just memories, but versions of myself.
Like I’ve been a hundred different girls,
and each one disappeared quietly when no one was looking.

Sometimes I wonder if trauma can do that.
If fear is strong enough to erase.
If guilt can hollow you out without you realizing it—
until all that’s left is routine.
A structure you’ve built like scaffolding just to keep standing.

I work in an insurance office.
Third cubicle from the window. Gray walls. Beige carpet.
Soft clicking of keys, low conversations behind glass.
I don’t hate it.
It gives me something to hold onto.
A reason to wake up, to move through the day.
A place where no one asks too many questions.
No one even calls me Emily unless they have to.
Mostly I’m just “her”—the quiet girl who’s always on time,
who eats the same lunch every day,
who never forgets to refill the printer paper tray.

That’s the way I like it.
Predictable. Safe.
Clean lines. Clear steps.

I built my life like that—
little routines that hold me together,
the same way I hold the pages of this notebook in my lap.

Every morning, I write before I leave for work.
Even just a few sentences.
Sometimes more.
It helps me feel real.
Grounded.
Here.

Because if I don’t, I drift.
And if I drift too far, I don’t know if I’ll find my way back.



chapter two
The beginning of the end 

It was early autumn, and the town was still tucked beneath the hush of morning. The pavement glistened with dew, fallen leaves pressed flat and dark across the sidewalk like ink stains. A soft mist hovered just above the ground, clinging to the spaces between buildings, and the air carried that unmistakable crispness that only comes at the start of the season. The sun had just begun to rise—low and golden, barely stretching over the rooftops—casting a warm, sleepy light that made everything feel softer, quieter.

I walked the same path I always did, passing shuttered storefronts and quiet windows. The town was still waking up, and I liked it best that way. Peaceful. Predictable.

The coffee shop sat on the corner of Willow and 3rd, snug between an old bookstore and a closed-down barber shop. Its red brick exterior was worn with time, ivy creeping up the side like it was trying to pull the place back into the earth. The wooden sign above the door creaked when the wind hit it just right, and the windows were always fogged on the inside this time of year, blurring the soft yellow glow within.

Even before stepping inside, the scent pulled me in—roasted espresso, vanilla, and the faintest trace of something sweet and spiced, like cinnamon sugar on warm bread. It wrapped around me like a memory I couldn’t place.

Inside, the warmth greeted me instantly. The walls were lined with old wood shelves filled with mismatched mugs and little potted plants. A couple of round tables sat near the front window, and the faint hum of indie music buzzed under the soft hiss of steaming milk. The bell above the door gave its familiar chime, and there she was.

Lanie.

Always behind the counter, like she belonged there. Same soft features, same bright smile—the kind that made you feel seen. I always matched it without thinking, like a reflex.

“One large mocha with two shots of espresso,” she said, already sliding the cup toward me.

I couldn’t help the smile tugging at my lips. “You know me so well.”

She laughed lightly. “You know, you’ve been coming in here for about two years now, every single day… and I still don’t know your name.”

That caught me off guard. Not because she asked—but because she was right. We’d gone all this time without actually speaking beyond orders and smiles. Maybe we were both too shy. Or maybe we’d just fallen into a rhythm neither of us wanted to disturb.

“Well,” I said, laughing softly, “I guess it never really came up.”

“My name’s Emily. Emily Harper. But my friends call me Emmy.”

“Nice to officially meet you, Emily,” she said, her voice light, playful. She handed me my cup, her fingers brushing mine in the smallest, softest way.

As I reached for it, something caught my eye—writing on the side of the cup, just above the logo.

Before I could read it, she added, almost too casually, “That’ll be $3.50.”

Still a little distracted, I handed her the cash and dropped the change in the tip jar without thinking.

“Thanks,” I said, stepping out into the cool air again. The breeze was crisper now, and I tucked the cup into both hands, letting the warmth seep into my fingers.

As I took my first sip, my eyes drifted back to the cup.

There it was, written in neat black ink, just under my name:

Here’s my number, 246.496.6729. Call me sometime :)

I stopped walking for a moment.

Then smiled.

For a moment, the rest of the world faded—the passing cars, the shifting wind, even the distant sound of someone unlocking a nearby storefront. All I could hear was my own heartbeat in my ears, like the sudden rush of water filling a quiet room.

I stared at the cup, blinking once, then again, just to make sure I wasn’t imagining it. The steam curled lazily from the lid, catching the light like a veil.

It felt like such a small thing. Ink on a paper cup. But somehow, it shifted something in me.

I turned back toward the shop instinctively, half-expecting to catch one last glimpse of her through the window. And there she was—Lanie—already moving behind the counter, but she looked up. Our eyes met for just a second. She gave a shy, knowing smile, and then turned away.

The moment broke, and I kept walking. My fingers tightened around the cup like it might float away if I let go.

I should’ve felt confident. Flattered, even. But instead, I felt… unsure. Nervous in a way I hadn’t been in years. She had always felt safe to me—a warm smile, a steady presence in the blur of routine. This was something else entirely.  
  


chapter two
The Blackout

I didn’t call Lanie that first night.

I thought about it—more than once.
The urge would rise in quiet waves, catching me off guard.
When I was brushing my teeth. When I was staring into the fridge, unsure if I was hungry. When I was lying in bed with the phone beside me, her number glowing soft and silent in the dark.

But I never pressed call.
The number sat in my contacts like a trapdoor—one that once opened, couldn’t be shut again. Just seeing it made my chest tighten.

Instead, I floated through the next few days in that hazy space between want and fear.
I’d unlock my phone, thumb hovering over her name.
Once, I even typed out a message—“Hey, are you around?”—but deleted it before I finished the sentence.
I kept telling myself: tomorrow.
Then: maybe the next day.

But still—I went back to the café.

Of course I did.

And there she was.
Always there, behind the counter, sleeves rolled to her elbows, her dark hair pulled back messily, like she’d forgotten she was beautiful.
That same soft smile that made the world seem quieter.
Those eyes that watched more than they let on.

But something had changed between us.
There was a gravity now.
A silent pull, like we were standing at opposite ends of a thread no one else could see.

On the third day, I broke the silence.

“I still have your number, you know,” I said casually, like I hadn’t rehearsed it five different ways in my head.

Her eyes lit up. “I was starting to think I scared you off.”

I smiled, though it didn’t quite reach. “Not scared.”

“Then call me.”

Her voice was light, but something underneath it felt weighted. Like it mattered.

So I did.
Later that night.
And again the next day.
And again after that.

It started with texts.
Small, harmless things.
What are you doing?
Have you ever tried that Thai place on Main?
This song made me think of you.

Then it became calls.
Then meetups.
Then routines that didn’t feel like routines.

Late walks through neighborhoods we didn’t belong to.
Laughing over street art and garbage bins and the way dogs looked at us like we were secrets.
A thrift store afternoon that turned into hours of flipping through old records and paperbacks with cracked spines.
She teased me about the notebooks I kept in my bag. I told her I needed them. She didn’t press.

Lanie made the world feel lighter.
But she also made it tilt in ways I didn’t expect.

One night, while we were sharing fries from a paper tray outside a gas station, she asked me, “What’s your earliest memory?”

I opened my mouth to answer.
Nothing came.

“I don’t know,” I said finally, embarrassed. “That’s weird. I guess I’ve never thought about it.”

She was quiet for a second.
Then: “Mine’s of a forest. But it didn’t feel real. The trees were too still. Like they were watching.”

I looked at her. “That’s… eerie.”

“I know,” she said, smiling. “But it felt like home. In a way.”

She said it like a joke. But it didn’t feel like one.

A week later, we met at an old bookstore downtown.
Rain streaked down the fogged windows, and the air inside smelled like dust, paper, and time.
We wandered aimlessly through the aisles, speaking in whispers, fingers brushing over old covers and faded titles.

Lanie stopped at a shelf in the very back.
Pulled out a book with a cracked black spine.

“Have you ever read The Ones We Forgot?”

I shook my head.

“It’s about a woman who starts remembering things that never happened to her. Lives that aren’t hers. But they feel like they are.”

I stared at the cover: a house drawn in sketchy lines, all the windows black—except for one, faintly glowing.

“That sounds…” I hesitated. “Familiar.”

She tilted her head, watching me. “Yeah. I thought it might.”

There was something sharp in my chest then. Not pain, exactly.
Recognition.
Like I’d seen that house before.
Like I’d stood behind that glowing window.

“I get those sometimes,” I murmured. “Little flashes. Not quite memories. More like… echoes.”

Lanie didn’t say anything.
Just reached out and squeezed my hand.

And for a second, I wanted to pull away—not because it felt wrong, but because it felt known. Too known.

A few nights later, Lanie came over.

It was the first time I’d let her see my apartment.
I don’t invite people in.
Not because I’m unfriendly—but because my space is sacred.
Structured.
Safe.

It’s a third-floor walk-up above an old hardware store that smells like nails and turpentine. The stairs creak. The hallway hums with fluorescent buzz. But inside—it’s quiet.

Neutral walls. Pale, soft light.
Furniture that serves its purpose. No clutter. No color.
Everything has its place.
A photograph of a mountain I’ve never climbed.
A stack of notebooks by the window, arranged by size and date.
A candle I never light.
A couch I never nap on.

Lanie looked around, and for a moment, I saw it through her eyes.
Spare. Clinical. Maybe even a little lonely.

But she didn’t say any of that.
She just smiled and held up the wine.

We sat on the couch with a movie playing low in the background. She brought caramel popcorn in a crinkled plastic bag and laughed through the dumbest scenes. I didn’t. I couldn’t seem to focus.

At one point, I felt her eyes on me.

“What?” I asked.

“You looked… different just now.”

“Different how?”

“Like you were somewhere else.”

I blinked. “Maybe I was.”

Lanie leaned her head back against the cushion, watching me from the side. “Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you’d just… turned left instead of right one day?”

I swallowed. “I don’t really like to think about that.”

“But you do.”

Again, that tone.
Not judgment. Just certainty.

And again—I didn’t answer.

Something about her felt like a mirror I wasn’t ready to look into.

A long silence settled. The kind that fills the room with questions neither of us asked.

Then she shifted.

“I should go,” she said, already rising.

“You don’t have to.”

“I know,” she said, her voice small.

I followed her to the door.

She paused before leaving.
Turned to look at me.

“Thanks for letting me in.”

It sounded heavier than it should’ve.

Then she walked out into the hallway.
Her boots echoed all the way down the stairs.

Later that night I woke up on the floor.

The hardwood was cold against my cheek.
My hands were curled beneath me like I’d braced for impact.

The microwave clock blinked: 3:11 a.m.
The TV was on—but nothing played. Just static, humming faintly.

I sat up slowly, body aching.
I couldn’t remember falling asleep.
I couldn’t remember going to bed.

But I had been dreaming. I was sure of it.

The images slipped away the moment I opened my eyes—but one stuck.

A long white hallway.
Windowless.
Endless.
The air was thick, muffled.
And gouged into the wall at uneven intervals—
The number 9.
Carved again and again like someone had done it with shaking hands.

I stood, dazed.
The fridge beeped.
The lamps blinked back on.
All the digital clocks reset.

The power had gone out.

I walked to the window.

Across the street, the café was dark.

Except for one light glowing from the back—
the office, I think.
The room I’d never seen inside.

It stayed on, steady and soft.

Like someone had never left.

Like someone was waiting.
Or watching.
Or remembering. 



chapter three
Patterns

I woke up already dressed.

Jeans creased, shirt bunched at the waist like I had tossed and turned in it all night. My notebook lay open on the floor beside the bed, pen still tucked in the spiral. I must have been writing before I fell asleep.

There was only one line on the page:

ask lanie abt the dream

I stared at it, the letters uneven like I’d written them in a hurry—or half-asleep. I didn’t remember writing it. I didn’t remember dreaming either. 
I shut the notebook and sat on the edge of the bed, letting my feet touch the floor for a long time before I stood up. Something felt… off. Not wrong, just shifted. Like the room had been moved an inch to the left while I wasn’t looking.

Outside, the sky was washed in that pale blue haze that always came just before a storm. The air was warm but unsettled. I kept thinking I could smell rain, though nothing had fallen yet.

The café sat like a steady fixture on the corner—same soft light, same chipped wood sign, same rustling of newspaper pages and ceramic mugs clinking together. I went there every morning because it was predictable. Because I didn’t have to think about anything once I stepped through the door.

Lanie was already behind the counter, wiping the espresso machine down with a towel slung over her shoulder. She glanced up the second I walked in. Her expression was neutral but familiar, like she’d seen this version of me before.

“Morning,” she said, her voice smooth but careful. “You okay?”

“I think so,” I said, but it sounded like a question.

She didn’t push. “The usual?”

I nodded, and she turned without another word.

I took my seat by the window, notebook still in hand. I didn’t open it yet. Just sat there watching the light shift across the table, tracing the steam that curled from a stranger’s cup two seats down. My own drink arrived minutes later—warm, sweet, grounding.

When Lanie placed the cup in front of me, she didn’t walk away. Instead, she hesitated like she wanted to say something, then slid into the seat across from me.

“You look like you didn’t sleep,” she said.

I smiled faintly. “I don’t remember.”

That made her eyebrows lift, just slightly. She didn’t speak, but I felt the shift between us. Like I’d confirmed something she’d already suspected.

I flipped open my notebook, turned it toward her, and tapped the single line.
ask lanie about the dream

Her face didn’t change much, but her shoulders stiffened just enough for me to notice.

“I don’t remember writing it,” I said. “Or dreaming.”

Lanie leaned back in the chair, studying me with a softness that didn’t quite hide her caution.

“Sometimes we remember the feeling before we remember the details,” she said.

“Have I said anything before?” I asked. “About a dream?”

She hesitated. Then: “Not with words.”

That made my stomach tighten. “What does that mean?”

Lanie glanced toward the window, then back at me.

“It means your body knows things your mind hasn’t caught up to yet.”

I looked down at the notebook again. The handwriting was definitely mine. And yet, it felt like a stranger had written it.

“Was it… a bad dream?” I asked.

She didn’t answer right away. Then, quietly:
“I think it was something you needed to see again.”

My heart tapped against my ribs, too light to be a full panic, too loud to ignore.

I wrapped my hands around the cup, holding onto the heat like it could anchor me.

“Will it come back?” I asked.

Lanie’s voice was gentler this time. “Only if you’re ready.”

When I stepped outside, the air had shifted. A breeze kicked up, thick with the scent of wet concrete. The clouds had rolled in without warning, sudden and heavy.

I started walking home, one hand still wrapped around the now-empty cup.

As I passed a shuttered storefront, something caught my eye in the reflection of the glass. Not my face, but behind it—
a flash of red fabric, and the silhouette of a child’s hand pressed to a fogged window.

I turned sharply.

There was no one there.

But my heart was racing. My palms were damp. And I could hear something, faint and sharp in my ears:

A lullaby.
Soft. Crooked. Half-familiar.
And suddenly, I could smell fire.



chapter four
The restoration 

The rain came just after sunset.
Not a storm, just a steady fall that soaked the streets and blurred the glow of traffic lights outside my window. It was the kind of rain that quiets everything else, the kind that makes you feel like the world has been gently placed on pause.

I hadn’t turned on the lights. I didn’t need them. I sat curled up on the couch, my notebook open in my lap but untouched since this morning. The words were still there, circled once in shaky pen:

ask lanie about the dream

I still didn’t remember writing it. Still didn’t remember dreaming anything at all. But I remembered showing her. I remembered the way Lanie looked at me after she read it—something between recognition and concern. Like she’d been holding something back until I was ready to ask.

A soft knock pulled me from my thoughts. Three quiet taps.

I stood and walked slowly to the door. When I looked through the peephole, I wasn’t surprised to see her standing there.

Lanie.

Rain in her hair, arms crossed like she was holding herself together.

I opened the door.

“Hey,” she said, voice warm but cautious. “I know it’s late. I wasn’t sure if I should come, but… after this morning, I figured maybe it would help.

“It’s okay,” I said. “I’m glad you’re here.”

The rain had quieted by the time Lanie came.

Not stopped — just softened. Like the world was holding its breath.

She stood in the doorway in her oversized hoodie, her hair damp and clinging to her cheeks. I stepped aside to let her in.

The room was dim, glowing faintly from the streetlight outside. We sat on the couch, the silence between us thick but not uncomfortable.

I held my notebook loosely in my lap, open to the page she’d seen that morning at the café.

ask lanie about the dream

She looked at it again but didn’t smile this time. Her expression was solemn. Present.

“I wasn’t sure I should come,” she said after a while, voice low. “But if it were me… I think I’d want someone to tell me the truth. Even if it hurt.”

I nodded.

Lanie sat back, hands clasped in her lap like she needed to ground herself.

“I was raised in a place called The Restoration,” she said. “It wasn’t a church. Not exactly. But they talked about God like they’d met Him personally. Like He whispered rules to them in the dark.”

She exhaled slowly.

“They had rules. Dozens of them. But their core belief was that every third child born was a curse. That every third life tipped the balance toward destruction. So they had a system. A brutal, unwavering rule.”

I didn’t speak. I couldn’t.

“They called it the Balance Doctrine. Every third child had to be removed. For the ‘good of the world.’ They didn’t call it killing. They said it was cleansing. Purifying. A holy offering.”

Lanie’s voice didn’t rise. It didn’t need to. The calmness made it worse.

“I had a sister,” she said. “Her name was Miriam. She was born just after midnight. We were a family of  three for twenty minutes.”

I watched her eyes go somewhere far away.

“I remember my mother holding her. Still bleeding, still shaking. My dad wasn’t even allowed in the room. It was just her, and me watching from the hallway. Miriam was tiny — red-faced, wrapped in the only blanket we weren’t supposed to use. My mom hummed to her. Sang the way mothers do when no one’s listening.”

Her voice went softer.

“Then they came. The same night. Dressed in white robes. Heads covered. Holding lanterns that glowed an ominous red color.  They didn’t ask. They didn’t wait. They took her from my mother’s arms while she was still crying into the sheets.”

My throat burned. My whole body had gone cold.

“They didn’t do it quickly,” she whispered. “That would’ve been mercy. They had a ritual. I won’t tell you all of it. But I watched. I was standing on the stairs.”

Her eyes looked glassy, distant.

“She didn’t scream. My mom. She never screamed. That was one of the rules. Crying was weakness. Pain was sacred. You had to feel it, not express it. And if you broke that—if you made a sound—you were punished.”

I swallowed hard. “Punished how?”

Lanie looked down at her hands, turning her thumbs over each other.

“You weren’t allowed to speak during daylight unless granted permission. You couldn’t show emotion unless it was joy. Even that could be punished if it looked unnatural.”

Her voice was steady, but there was something brittle underneath it. Like a thin sheet of ice over a frozen lake.

“If you broke a rule—even something small—they sent you to The Silence Room. It was underground. No windows. No sound. You’d go in barefoot, wearing just a white linen shift. You’d stay there until they said you’d learned your lesson.”

She paused.

Sometimes days. Sometimes longer. They fed you water through a slot in the floor—just enough to keep you alive, never enough to feel human. They didn’t let you sleep. If you tried, they’d blast recordings through the walls—crying, screaming, alarms that spiked at random intervals until you couldn’t tell if they were real or inside your skull. The darkness was total—so complete it felt alive. Your eyes would ache from trying to find shapes in the black. You started seeing things that weren’t there. Smells, too. Burning plastic. Rotting meat. Your own skin.
Time stopped making sense. Hunger twisted into nausea, then into a kind of hollow buzzing in your bones. Your body ate itself in slow degrees. Muscles shook. Your thoughts scattered. Some people screamed. Others went quiet, too quiet. One girl bit off part of her own finger—just to feel something. Another went mute for six months. One boy laughed so hard he broke his own teeth. And sometimes you’d think you heard someone whispering right next to you, but no one was there. You were never touched—but it always felt like something was waiting in the dark, breathing behind your ear.
My chest ached just listening.

“They didn’t believe in love,” Lanie continued. “Said it made you selfish. If two people got too close, they’d separate them. Make them forget. Erase their names from each other.”

She looked at me then.

“One day, my mother was just… gone. No goodbye. No explanation. They said I’d become too dependent. That meant they wiped her. Gave her a new name. A new purpose. Maybe a new child to raise. Or maybe they locked her away and told her to forget me.”

A long silence.

“And the worst part?” Her voice dropped. “After a while… you start to believe them. That you deserve it. That it’s your fault. That you were born wrong.”

My hands were trembling.

Lanie’s eyes met mine — not accusing, not pitying. Just knowing.

“I don’t remember any of this,” I whispered. “Not for me. Nothing like that.”

She gave a small, sad smile.

“I didn’t either,” she said. “Not at first. For years, I thought I had a vivid imagination. I’d get flashes. Smells. Words I didn’t understand. I’d wake up screaming from dreams I couldn’t explain.”

I looked down at my notebook. At the empty margins. At the line I’d written that morning, like some part of me already knew.

ask lanie about the dream

Lanie leaned closer.

“I told you this because I see something in you, Emily. The way you watch everything. The way you remember so little, but feel so much. That’s what it felt like. That’s what it still feels like.”

My throat was tight. My whole body felt like it was vibrating, but I couldn’t tell from what. Fear? Grief? Recognition?

“I’m not saying it’s the same,” Lanie said. “But something happened to you. And whatever it is… you don’t have to go through it alone.”

She reached across the couch and gently took my hand.

“I can’t promise it won’t hurt,” she said. “But I can promise I won’t leave you in it.”

I didn’t speak.

But I didn’t pull away either.

Outside, the rain started again—soft, steady, quiet as breath.

And for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel completely alone.



chapter five
Dream Logic

After she told me everything—the robes, the rituals, the baby taken bleeding from her mother’s arms—Lanie went quiet.

She just sat there on the edge of the couch, staring at her hands. Not crying. Just gone, like she’d crawled deep inside herself and shut the door behind her.

“They burned the third child’s name,” she said finally. “So no one could speak it again. Like it erased the soul.”

I couldn’t find any words. I felt like I’d swallowed broken glass.

“You can stay here tonight,” I said, my voice too thin, too normal.

She nodded. “Please.”

I gave her a blanket, a shirt of mine to sleep in, and left the lamp on. She didn’t ask for that, but I think we both knew she wouldn’t sleep if the dark took the room completely.

I lay in bed for a long time, staring at the ceiling. Listening. I couldn’t tell if it was Lanie’s breathing I heard… or something else.

Eventually, sleep took me.

I was in the hallway again. My hallway. But longer. Warped.

The walls pulsed like lungs, like something was breathing just beneath the drywall. A deep, wet inhale. A slower, strained exhale.

My bedroom door was closed.

Something was behind it.

I reached for the handle. My hand was shaking. I turned it.

Inside, the room was dark. Too dark. The shadows were thick, solid, curling like vines along the ceiling.

Someone was lying in my bed. On their side. Hair the color of dried blood spilled across the pillow.

Me.

My body. Still and small and peaceful. My lips moved, whispering something. I leaned in.

“Don’t wake up,” I said. “It’s worse when you wake up.”

The voice wasn’t mine.

The walls peeled open like wet paper. Suddenly I was outside. On a street swallowed by fog.

A traffic light blinked red above me—slow, rhythmic, like a heartbeat.

Figures appeared in the distance. Gliding. No footsteps. White robes dragging on the concrete, sopping with something thick and black. Their faces hidden by veils of stained linen.

“You let her in,” they said.
“You let her in.”
“You let her in.”

I turned to run. But the fog pulled at my legs, thick like syrup. Something sharp scraped across the pavement behind me.

A child’s cry echoed through the air—wet and sudden, cut off mid-scream.

I spun around—

Lanie was standing in the road.

But she wasn’t Lanie.

Her face was cracked down the center like shattered porcelain. Her eyes were hollow, pupils stretching outward into black spirals. Her fingers twitched unnaturally. One arm too long. Her mouth opened—jaw unhinging.

“You were supposed to die,” she whispered. “You were the third.”

Her smile was a wound. Her teeth—there were too many.

I screamed—


And woke up.

Sweating. Cold. My sheets soaked. My heart sprinting.

I sat up, hands gripping the edge of the mattress. Tried to breathe.

A dream. Just a dream.

The apartment was quiet. My room was still.

I got out of bed and opened the door slowly.

The lamp in the living room was still on.

Lanie was sitting on the couch. Back straight. Perfectly still.

“Lanie?” I whispered.

She didn’t respond.

I stepped closer. She wasn’t blinking. Her eyes were locked on the wall across from her, wide and wet and shining.

“Lanie?”

She turned her head. Not like a person. Like a marionette. One single jerk of the neck. Her face slack.

“There are three of you now,” she said. Her voice layered—hers and something beneath it, something old and rotted. “Only one can stay.”

Her mouth stretched wide, and something started pushing out of it—long, gray, wet.

I stumbled back.

And then the walls screamed.

Not figuratively. They screamed—a thousand voices layered into one shrieking wail. Paint peeled, lights exploded in bursts of sparks. The apartment bled.

I turned to run—but the hallway folded like paper, collapsing into itself. Lanie stood in the doorway, her hands burning, her skin sloughing off like wax.

“You were never out,” she said. “You only think you woke up.”


I jolted awake.

The real kind. I think.

My mouth was dry. My heart thundered. The room was dark, normal-dark. The ceiling didn’t breathe.

But I didn’t move. Not right away.

Finally, I opened my bedroom door.

Lanie was still there—on the couch, asleep, arms wrapped around herself.

Quiet. Human.

But I couldn’t stop staring at her face.

Because in the dream… her eyes had looked exactly the same.

And part of me still wasn’t sure I was awake.


chapter six 
Not Really Awake


The smell of coffee pulled me out of the fog.

Weak sunlight crept through the window above the sink, casting long, dusty streaks across the hardwood floor. For a second, I didn’t know where I was—then the sound of the percolating coffee pot brought it back. My apartment. Morning. Real.

Lanie stood at the counter, barefoot, wearing one of my old oversized sleep shirts—the faded navy one with the stretched neckline and frayed hem. It fell just above her knees, the sleeves too long, nearly swallowing her hands. Her black hair was a tousled mess, but the two blonde streaks in the front framed her face in soft curls, catching the morning light like ribbons of gold.

She looked calm. Too calm.

Her posture was loose, comfortable. Her expression was soft. She stirred sugar into her mug with the kind of ease that belonged to someone who felt safe. Her presence filled the kitchen like it belonged there.

Not like the thing I saw in my dream.

Not like the creature with spiral-black eyes and too many teeth.

When she looked up, her eyes were their normal color. Just hazel. Tired, maybe. But warm.

“You didn’t sleep,” she said, already pouring a second mug. Her voice was steady. Normal.

I tried to laugh it off, but it came out dry. “Was it that obvious?”

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I took the coffee and sat at the edge of the couch. My hands trembled slightly, but the ceramic was warm and solid. It helped.

Lanie leaned back against the counter, one foot tucked behind the other. She wore my shirt like it was hers, like it had always been hers. I tried to shake off the feeling of dread curling in my stomach, but it clung to me like humidity.

“You ever have a dream that just… won’t let go?” I asked.

She raised an eyebrow. “Let me guess. I was in it?”

I nodded slowly. “It was more like… you were and you weren’t. You looked like you, but you said things—awful things. That I was part of them. That I was the third.”

Lanie’s smile faded. She looked down at her cup, then back at me. Her expression had gone still.

“Dreams like that… they don’t just come from nowhere,” she said. “Sometimes your brain’s trying to piece things together before you’re ready.”

“You think I’m remembering something?” I asked, my voice lower now. “Something real?”

“I think,” she said carefully, “that your brain knows more than it lets on.”

We sat in silence for a long moment. The only sound was the quiet clink of her spoon against the ceramic.

Then she glanced up at the clock.

“Shit,” she muttered. “I’m gonna be late.”

“For work?”

She nodded, already turning toward the hallway. “Yeah. My shift starts at nine. Do you think I could borrow something to wear? I wasn’t really planning on crashing here.”

“Of course.” I stood too fast, almost spilling my coffee.

Lanie tilted her head slightly. “You okay?”

“Yeah. Just still… off.”

I ducked into my bedroom and grabbed a pair of jeans I thought might fit her, plus one of my favorite cardigans—a soft, oversized gray one, worn at the sleeves. Something about offering it to her felt strangely intimate, like giving away a piece of myself.

When I handed her the clothes, her smile returned—soft and sincere.

“Thanks,” she said, running a thumb over the edge of the cardigan. “You really didn’t have to.”

“I wanted to,” I said, and meant it. “It’ll look good on you.”

She nodded and padded down the hall to the bathroom.

The door clicked shut behind her.

I stood in the silence she left behind and watched the way the morning light stretched across the carpet. I should’ve felt comforted.

But instead, I stared at the spot she’d been standing and couldn’t shake the feeling that part of the dream was still here—waiting, just behind her eyes.

About 20 minutes later I got ready like I always do.

Shower. Brush teeth. Moisturizer. Light swipe of nude lip balm. No makeup—never. I kept my look simple, natural. My clothes were soft, neutral tones—beige blouse, tan trousers—something to blend in, not stand out. Shoes lined up exactly where they belong by the front door. I moved through the motions like muscle memory, but it all felt just a second off. Like someone had rearranged the script behind my back.

I left ten minutes later than usual.

The walk to work was the same path I always took, but the streets felt unfamiliar—like I was walking through a city built to look like mine. The stoplights seemed to flicker at the edges. The crosswalk sign glitched for a second, then reset itself.

My office building loomed ahead, sterile and beige and familiar. I walked through the automatic doors, smiled weakly at the receptionist, and tried to pretend everything was fine.

But it wasn’t.

I was behind from the second I sat down at my desk. My emails were already piling up. I forgot to flag a client request. I snapped at someone who asked for help with a printer jam—me, who always kept her cool. My fingers trembled on the keyboard. I misread reports. Missed calls. Forwarded the wrong spreadsheet.

Around noon, the message popped up on my screen:

Jay wants to see you. When you get a sec.

My stomach dropped.

I stood, legs slightly unsteady, and walked down the hallway toward his office. His door was open.

He smiled when he saw me. “Hey, Em. Come in. Shut the door?”

That was worse than the message.

I obeyed and sat in the chair across from his desk.

Jay folded his hands on top of a stack of files. “You okay?”

“I—yeah. Just a rough night.”

“You’re usually the most reliable person on this floor,” he said gently. “But today’s… not like you.”

I looked down at my hands. They were clenched in my lap, knuckles white.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to mess anything up.”

“You didn’t mess up,” he said quickly. “You’re just… not here. Mentally. That’s not a crime. But I need to ask—are you okay? Really?”

I opened my mouth to lie, but something in his tone stopped me. It wasn’t judgment. It was concern. Real concern.

“I think I’m just… overwhelmed,” I said. “Something personal. It’s been—hard to shake.”

Jay nodded. “Take a little time to breathe. Catch up when you can. Let me know if you need anything. Okay?”

I nodded, grateful and embarrassed all at once.

Back at my desk, I stared at my screen.

There were no robed figures. No voices. No spiraling black eyes.

Just Excel. And an inbox full of unread emails.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong.

And that whatever it was… it had followed me.

The government could claw back $2.2 billion a year from “wealthy” pensioners by lowering pension asset tests by $100,000 and a further $3 billion a year by lifting the rate used to estimate the income people earn on their assets, a leading economic adviser to the government says.

Modelling by the Australian National University for *The Australian Financial Review* also showed taxpayers are paying about $4 billion a year in payments to people living in homes worth more than $1.5 million, including $1.8 billion to people living in homes worth more than $2 million.



Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek was informed that some seniors are claiming the pension although they are building up inheritances for their offspring. **Bethany Rae**

Labor has no plans to include the family home in the pension asset test, but is open to ideas ahead of Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ economic roundtable later this month to fix the structural deficit plaguing the budget bottom line.

[The opposition is opposing any net increase to tax revenue](https://archive.md/o/8MjCt/https:/www.afr.com/politics/federal/no-net-tax-increase-coalition-s-red-line-for-chalmers-summit-20250731-p5mj5x) and wants to see the deficit fixed by spending cuts.

One area for reform is who gets the pension, said ANU Associate Professor Ben Phillips, who conducted the modelling and is also a member of Labor’s advisory committee on economic inclusion.

“The Australian welfare system is largely designed to help those who can’t or have limited ability to help themselves. But the age pension currently directs several billion a year to households who are not in that group,” he said.

The Department of Social Services earlier this year warned its incoming minister, Tanya Plibersek, that [wealthy seniors were claiming the pension while also building additional wealth for inheritances](https://archive.md/o/8MjCt/https:/www.afr.com/politics/federal/plibersek-warned-over-wealthy-pensioners-20250724-p5mhet) rather than merely paying for retirement.

DSS’ brief said the current system meant low- and middle-income taxpayers were “subsidising the retirement incomes of seniors with significant wealth in addition to their homes”.

It noted under the assets test and deeming rates that a partial pension “continues to be payable to couples with income of almost $100,000 a year or assets of almost $1.05 million, in addition to their principal home of unlimited value”.

Phillips, who is principal research fellow at the ANU’s Centre for Social Research and Methods, said while the age pension was modest at around $575 per week for a single person, it was also lightly means-tested.

“There is a cohort on the age pension who may have relatively modest incomes with relatively high living standards as their wealth is high and their housing costs low,” he said. “This cohort tends to have very low rates of financial stress, typically much lower than employed persons.”

Lowering the pension asset tests by $100,000 would primarily affect people in the top two wealth quantiles. Of the $2.2 billion a year the change would raise, $2.01 billion comes from these two cohorts, Phillips’ modelling shows.

The situation is similar for increasing deeming rates in line with the Reserve Bank of Australia’s official cash rate. Of the $2.97 billion a year that would be raised by lifting deeming rates 3.75 percentage points higher, $2.17 billion would come from the top two wealth groups.

Deeming rates are used to estimate the amount of income people earn from financial assets. They feed into means testing for social security payments, including the Centrelink age pension, JobSeeker and parenting payments.

When the rate is increased, it is equivalent to saying the pensioner is earning [more on their private assets and therefore needs less welfare support](https://archive.md/o/8MjCt/https:/www.afr.com/wealth/personal-finance/pensioners-face-income-hit-as-cost-of-living-soars-20240318-p5fd8z).

In the 20 years before 2022, deeming rates largely followed the central bank cash rate. As the RBA slashed rates to an emergency level of 0.1 per cent in 2020, deeming rates followed lower.

But when rates began rising sharply in May 2022 – to 4.35 per cent by late 2023 – [deeming rates were left on hold](https://archive.md/o/8MjCt/https:/www.afr.com/politics/federal/deeming-cliff-looms-for-850k-aged-pensioners-welfare-recipients-20240505-p5fp0k) in what was framed as a cost-of-living measure. If the rates were returned to their long-term levels in line with the cash rate, welfare recipients would have their payments cut, but the federal budget bottom line would be billions of dollars better off.

“The deeming rate was lowered considerably when interest rates were at emergency low rates during COVID. But with interest rates now back to normal levels, better reflecting the returns on financial assets today, it makes sense to increase those rates,” Phillips said.

“Increasing the deeming rate and tightening the asset test is one of the few areas of the welfare system where genuine budget savings can be made without doing much harm.”

Of the 900,105 people who receive government welfare and have income from other sources, about 460,000 are aged pensioners, while 143,000 are on JobSeeker payments, and a further 120,000 are on parenting payments.

Meet Mia, a nursing student with big dreams but a bigger fear: the 2025 ATI CMS Fundamental Exam. Between clinicals and late-night study sessions, she was drowning in terms like “therapeutic communication” and “patient safety protocols.”

One day, while sipping her third coffee, Mia stumbled across a post on X raving about the [2025 Ultimate ATI CMS Fundamental Exam Review](https://examshut.com/product/2025-ultimate-ati-cms-fundamental-exam-review/?currency=usd) from ExamsHut.com. Desperate, she gave it a shot. The practice questions were spot-on, mimicking the real exam’s tricky scenarios—like prioritizing patient care or nailing infection control steps. The detailed explanations turned her “huh?” moments into “aha!” ones.

Mia used the progress tracker to zero in on weak spots, and by exam day, she strutted in like a pro. Result? She aced it, celebrating with a victory dance in the parking lot!

1mit1gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Estheticians/comments/1mit1gn/how_do_i_hire_an_experienced_esthetician/,How do I hire an experienced esthetician?!,"I work at a Spa in Alberta Canada and we have RMT's and estheticians. We have been open for a little under a year and experienced estheticians are ridiculously hard to find or professional ones.

I have made posts on social media, have an opening on our website and have called around to beauty schools. We offer yearly raises, health benefits, flexible hours, personalized advertising and discounts in Spa. We want someone who didnt just graduate from their esthetics program and has some experience. So now my question is: 

What am I doing wrong? Are we asking too much? Not offering enough?

The Spa owner wants me to start googling and finding people I would like to come work for us (I do have a few people in mind) and book appointments at their current workplace and talk to them about positions or arrange for coffee's/meetings but this is a smaller city and poaching gets around fast and feels a bit sketchy? And seems like it would give us a bad name. 

But at the same time messaging people on socials or sharing our posts with them seems like the only idea I can come up with?? 

Our current esthetician (we have one who's been with us from the start) doesn't think thats the right way to go either but I dont know how else to entice people to even apply for the position.

How would you like to be approached as an esthetician? Where do you look for job openings? Any advice you can give is super helpful! Thank you!

1mit1cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1mit1cd/the_stanley_miller_origin_of_life_experiment_from/,The Stanley Miller Origin of Life Experiment from 1952: Part 2,"Darwin certainly has not lost his place in the subset of science that is origin-of-life, but every subset needs its own tee shirt and coffee mug star. That honor falls to Stanley Miller, who in 1952 created a few amino acids in the lab among contrived conditions and thereafter held firm that such conditions must have prevailed in primordial earth—otherwise his findings could not have happened. If that seems like somewhat circular reasoning, consider that Dr. Hazen says as much: “Most previous origin researchers have fallen into a kind of trial-and-error approach to devising hypotheses; they would cook up some likely geochemical recipe and run an experiment. If the experiment did something interesting, they patched together a theory around those observations.”

Well—surely the field’s own “Darwin” didn’t do this. Yes, even he: “Stanley Miller’s experiment is a case in point. The Miller-Urey experiment produced amino acids, so his followers became convinced that that’s how it happened long ago in nature.” In fact, what he did was not even new. The Great Courses professor tells of another scientist who did exactly the same thing fifty years earlier, Walter Loeb, a German chemist. But Loeb didn’t frame it as searching for life’s origin; he just said he was mixing chemicals. Nor was he a self-promoter. Moreover, he was German, and in the years immediately following the World Wars, nobody wanted to hear anything from Germany. So they just find something that works and say, ‘Ha! Early earth must have been that way! Otherwise, my experiment would have flopped!’ It is not exactly rigorous science, most neutral parties would conclude. So typical is this slipshod guesswork passing for science that when someone comes along who actually details his work, it’s a big deal! “You don’t mind if I brag a little,” Gunter Wachtershauser says many years later, “but something like this has never been done in the entire field.” It hasn’t?! All he did was provide “more than 100 pages of specific chemical reactions. Each of these reactions is a testable step.” Aren’t they all supposed to do that? Instead, they just spin guesses and gullible atheists lap it all up as ‘science!’ “We’re going to take a much closer look at Gunter Wachtershauser’s theory in lecture 20,” Dr. Hazen says, and when he does, he finds other things not to like, but at least Wachtershauser did what you would think all scientists would do.

So, Stanley Miller is top dog, the Darwin in his field. He does not want to lose his place. Of a competing hypothesis, he mutters: “The vent hypothesis is a real loser. I don’t understand why we even have to discuss it.” The reason “we” do is that, for all the euphoria, his hypothesis has some gaping holes that sink it, Hazen points out. The early “primordial soup” is far too dilute to host steps necessary for abiogenesis. Not to mention that water, the “liquid of life,” and carbon, the “framework for all biomolecules,” don’t mix. Not to mention that certain steps essential to life never work in water at room pressure.

So, maybe some areas of high pressure are where life originated, Hazen lectures, and he considers oceanic vents where weird life has been discovered since Miller’s time. Maybe life originated there! And there are a host of researchers going in that direction. Presently, however, Hazen uncovers just as many difficulties there as with Miller’s soup. The non-scientist can get a rough idea of the troubles crushing pressure might pose to newly developing delicate life by smashing his thumb with a hammer.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

Since both scenarios post intractable problems, many others emerge. Maybe the earliest cells formed, not in the high-pressure ocean depths nor the low-pressure primordial soup, but on some material that served as a scaffold to pin the early molecule to, and after so serving, disappeared. There is a hypothesis that maybe life emerged, not as carbon-based, but as something-else based—clay, says one, minerals, says another—and only later transitioned to carbon-based. Maybe it started silicon-based, the outer shell of silicon offering the same connections as carbon, there being only an extra shell within. Like those Star Trek aliens who bored through solid rock—not a problem if you are rock-based yourself—to attack humans who had mistaken their eggs for bowling balls or some such thing.

Look, they’re all great guys and all. I wish them well—well, I guess I don’t—but it doesn’t matter if I do or don’t. They are impossible to discourage. Every match that doesn’t burn their fingers is the one they are convinced will light the next rocket ship to Mars. (and yes, there is also a hypothesis that life originated on Mars and came here via asteroid.) Well into the course, after he has discussed hypothesis after hypothesis and found them all wanting, he doesn’t conclude what anyone of common sense would conclude—that they’re all wrong. Bizarrely, he concludes probably all of them are right, or at least worthy likelihoods, and all that is needed is further experimentation to corroborate them!

“Look, I understand it may seem a little frustrating to have so many scientific cliffhangers but by the time you’re through with this lecture series you’ll be poised to share in all the incredible discoveries that are about to come, and I absolutely guarantee there will be exciting discoveries in the quest for life’s origins!” Tell me a guy like this can be discouraged.
