Or unfitting? LOL.,"This is a question for all of the music fans of Fresno/ Clovis, lol.

For me personally: “Freedom of Choice” by Devo (1980) at a Dick’s Sporting Goods, “Black Coffee in Bed” by Squeeze (1982) at Kohl’s, “Promises, Promises” by Naked Eyes (1983) at Target, and, “She’s A Beauty” by The Tubes (1983) at Winco.

But perhaps most unfitting was, “You Give Love A Bad Name” by Bon Jovi (1986) at the Asian RN Market lol.

Just curious as I’m a music nerd/ addict, sorry lol. Thanks.",1,1740550437.0,fresno,0,1.0,False

CaRMS (Canadian Match) is March 4th. Interviewed FM in two provinces, made it through two rounds of MMI interviews in one of them, so things do appear to be trending positively. Ranked a total of \~30 training sites across two provinces.

NRMP is March 21st. Interviewed with three FM programs in three states. One of them has three training sites, with individual ranking, so ranked a total of five programs.

Only interviewed in-person at one US program, and it is a gangsta-ass program, automatic ROL #1, no ifs, ands, or buts. I told them as much, when I told them my ECFMG is valid and I'm all set to start residency. 

Just got an email from an APD yesterday, saying they all enjoyed meeting me, hearing my story, how my goals may align with the program and they be looking forward to seeing me again soon. The salutation was kinda casual too, using an abbreviated nickname of mine (that I don't like or use, but is so common I can't blame them for going with it). Could be nothing, and I don't want to read too much into the email, but I do remember the APD telling me during my interview how they could relate to some of my challenges and experiences, and they shared some of their challenges when they were coming up, so maybe that's where they felt comfy with the casual email greeting. 

So, what's the problem?

If I match CaRMS - automatic removal from NRMP, because the systems talk to each other. Bye-bye NRMP ROL#1, my forever dream program. 

Usually NRMP happens first, but this year CaRMS is happening first. There are great programs that I've ranked, although I never got to visit any of them since it's all virtual, and I'm sure they have great people, but the US one that I went to in person - it was everything you could want and then everything you never even knew you could want or ask for, it really do be that gujji, no cap.

Ultimately, all that really matters in the end is that I match. Ideally, in my limited understanding, I match at a place I know and like - the US program. Barring that, I match any of the programs in first round Canadian match. Or enter second round. Or Post-NRMP SOAP. Then Scramble in both systems. Last and least preferred outcome would be to go unmatched anywhere.

The US program seems to like me (right?), and may very well rank me just as high. They are not known to do pre-match, a program resident told me as so. 

Now, this resident seems cool, but I don't really know them like that, only ever spoke once by phone, whaddup in passing. They did say they don't mind putting in a good word for me. I got the interview without any connects tho, didn't even know them until after I got an invite. I could tell them that I'm in both matches and I may quite possibly match CaRMS - which is not a guarantee, but a very real possibilty. 

CON: This has the risk of them going back to their Selection Committee and ranking me lower or unranking me altogether (assuming they are ranking me at all in the first place), because they don't want to vouch for someone they know isn't exclusively all in on their program, and the program understandably looks out for itself and its best interests.

EXTREMELY Unlikely Pro: If the program really thinks I'm the hot shit that I ~~think~~ know I am, they may offer a pre-match, at which point I withdraw from CaRMS.

HOWEVER, if they haven't ranked me at all, then it won't matter if I tell the resident or the APD about any of this in the interest of transparency. I just don't want to be chopping my legs off at the knees in the interest of transparency by being too trusting of the program.

NEVERTHELESS, none of what the program does maters if I match CaRMS, other than I never get to train there. And eat unlimited free buffet lunches. And unlimited coffee. And snacks. So. Many. Snacks. And lift in the hospital gym. And of course, become a well-rounded, 'Murican-trained, ABFM Certified, bonafide badass. I'd just be a Canadian-trained, XYZ-Province Board Certified, bonafide badass.

Unless I don't match. I'll still be me, still living the IMG life, still a badass who refuses to quit. I just won't be feeling like a badass for a minute. And then I'll be okay.

I do know and trust that it will all work out the way it was written and meant to, in which case I should just forget about thes mental gymnastics and just enjoy Ramadaan. I just wonder if it's worth the risk to let the program resident or APD know about the specifics of my situation.

Whaddayathink?

**TL;DR:**

Participating in both CaRMS (March 4) and NRMP (March 21). If I match CaRMS, I’m automatically withdrawn from NRMP, which means I lose my **#1 dream US program** (only in-person interview, perfect fit, unlimited snacks, free parking and gym access).

US program seems to like me, but has no pre-match history. A resident offered to vouch for me, but if I tell them I might match in Canada, it could backfire and get me ranked lower or not at all. On the other hand, if they **really** want me, they might pre-match (unlikely).

Do I risk being too transparent or just let things play out?",1,1740550429.0,IMGreddit,0,1.0,False

As the transport moved up and away, there was a slight scraping noise from the other side of the pavilion.

Sally turned to greet the agent from the Terran intelligence committee.

""I still don't like us baring it all like this"" said the gruff and very robotic voice coming from the box on the collar of the scarred Irish Wolfhound.

""It bothers me, we have been fine keeping things close to the chest, hell, most of the xenos never even asked directly about a lot of the things you and the others are now sprinkling on all these visitors.""

""Conner, you and I have had this back and forth more times than I've had ablative armor plates blown off and replaced up and down my mile long ass. Humanity consented to open up, the council felt it would help with relations and maybe shed some of the fear the others still feel about us, and I let you stick around and creep on the visitors because you gave your word you wouldn't bother any of them, but you damn well shouldn't expect me to be happy about it. Not when you tried to have some of them bagged for interrogation based on you being suspicious of their intentions.""

Conner huffed as he shakily sat before slowly collapsing forward. The cybernetic front legs seemed to be a bit stiff, and made a deeply unpleasant scraping noise as they dragged along the concrete. The one red glass eye glowed gently while the watery bloodshot biological one rolled in its socket with annoyance.

""You have a damn lot of pull, and for good reason, but even you should appreciate that what my department does ensures we continue enjoying a nice peaceful lifestyle while we care for the master's afflicted sons and daughters.""

""And that's another thing,"" she pointed angrily at him from her seat, ""I've asked you before not to refer to them that way around me.""

Conner huffed dismissively. ""Fine, the 'ones in twilight' as you insist. That label was manufactured for public relations reasons, I'm too old and to damn set in my ways to change my mind on it now. A name means little to our charges anyway, I don't know why you are so touchy about it.""

""It's disrespectful, it makes them sound diseased.""

""Aren't they in a way?""

""No you asshole, they are developmentally restricted, it's not a damn disease, it's a condition forced on them, if anything it's a genetic injury caused by the enemy and should be respected as such.""

""Caused by fucking traitors you mean. Traitors we burned for their sin down to the last man, a good number of them I tracked down personally you very well know.""

""Semantics. It doesn't matter anyway. What do you want, you usually hide behind a tree or something while giving the visitors the stink eye then piss off back to your 'secret base' in that clapped out rusty cargo hauler you parked at the edge of my starport. Real fucking super spy hidden and stealthy there, especially the 'I brake for bones' bumper sticker over the rear hatch.""

""The best hiding places are the ones in plain site you know. Hiding things away makes people who are looking for hidden things go rooting around and find them, parking a high grade intelligence operations suite in the shell of the most mundane cargo hauler and putting it in long term parking at a public starport makes it just another number on a bureaucratic tracking list to send the bill to each Friday, it establishes the vessel as part of the port officially and the longer it sits getting sporadic 'repairs' while the old miserable canine putters about looking tired and annoyed, the more people ignore it as just another eccentric retired dog playing pretend space trucker on a sanctuary world with the rest of the codgers using up their government subsidized income to entertain themselves while they wait for the grim reaper to remember they exist.""

""First off, dark, and rude, second, not the point, again, what do you want?""

""It's not really what I want, it's more of an FYI. I won't be here for your next appointment and I wanted to hand off the task to one of my subordinates. You needed to be informed as you are for all intents and purposes the ruler of this entire planet in all the ways that matter.""

""What, you got a hot date with a foreign agent to trade briefcases of intel at the edge of the galaxy and set up some crazy mission to save us all from the secret space nazi lizard men making a fourth comeback?""

Conner slowly sat up, his prosthetics making a concerning whining noise as he did so.

""I'm dying Sally.""

""Bullshit, you 90% machine and your brains been pickled into virtual immortality by the most illegal black box tech that even I'm only barely aware of.""

""No, I'm being serious. The Lazarus project was never meant for canids. The only reason it even worked on me at all was due to the gene hacking done to try and make a true viable human canine hybrid, I was unique, and I got to cheat death for longer than any non AI, but thats come to an end, the last course of telomere patching wouldn't take, and they can't try again so quickly without just scrambling my DNA. It takes a minimum of 10 years before another course can be attempted, and thats already pushing the limit well under what they project as viable, but I've only got maybe six months left before cell death rates overtake the regeneration. The mutation rate is so high now that the tumors might finish me before I even get that far. I'm done Sally. And you are the only one outside my crew that deserved to know. I'm going home to set a few things in order, then I'm going to spend my final days at home, the black box I was born in, I plan to let them study me under a microscope to the very end and beyond in the hopes my rotting corpse might provide insight into making this fucking treatment more stable for the few humans we get to see grow up properly. I'm tired Sally, but I am loyal to the end. My boy will be here in the morning to introduce himself. Please be kind, he is young and will make mistakes, I hope you can help temper him into a better agent than I ever was. Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to oil these joints one last time and drag my 300 year old ass out to the shuttle port and hitch a ride home since the boy will be taking over old rusty.""

Sally collapsed back into her chair. ""Shit, your serious. This isn't another god damned spy game, you aren't coming back this time are you?""

""No, I'm not. I shouldn't have last time, or the time before. I'm vary far past my expiration date, but I couldn't stop working. Not as long as I could keep standing back up and chasing away the shadows just beyond the fence.""

""Damnit Conner, why didn't you tell me sooner.""

""Because you would have tried to go all sappy, make amends, stop arguing, and be all mopey for the entire time till I finally left. That would have been miserable for the both of us, and I don't know about you but one of the few things that gets me out of bed every morning is the knowledge that my presence was a source of frustration for you, would you really want to take away an old man's one happy thing in life?""

""Fuck you Conner.""

""Fuck you too Sally, keep up with the hippy mommy storyteller shit you got goin on, apparently it's doing some solid PR numbers as these ET's go talk about their visits with you.""

""Oh go lay down and rest for once in your life you fucking battery powered snoop.""

""Thats the plan Sally. Be good girl.""

""Be good boy.""

""I always was.""

Conner stiffly moved out and into the rain, the whirring of his legs fading into the noise and the glow of his eye lost in the fog after a few meters.

Sally sat unmoving for a long time. Eventually she cut connection to her remote and withdrew her perception into her actual main hull. She tasked a few military satellites to overlap coverage on where she normally kept watch personally, a quick message to scramble the reserves for an unscheduled flight drill put half a dozen ships in orbit inside of 10 minutes, then into a circling pattern to run scans and make like it was war footing with the level of surveillance they were committing to for the drill. 

With that all in place she could close her ""eyes"" for a bit. She was normally watching the surface of the planet below, the entire sanctuary facility, the space around her and the planet, and everything else out to nearly 2000AU. If it was inside the systems oort cloud, she was probably aware of it. This wasn't really necessary, there was the local guard, the military station, the naval yard, and a thousand ships of various roles in the civilian and military circles, all connected and managed by the dozens of AI that ran flight control for the system, her efforts really were the definition of redundant, but it kept her occupied, and made her feel in control. But right now she needed some quiet time. 

""Fucking three centuries and you piss off with less than 5 minutes of banter, you really are an asshole Conner."" 

She shifted her perception into her core VR simulation, an internal space where her mind could visualize and interact with a simulation anything she could imagine or remember. She called up some of the more fond scenes, back when she was coming home from one of the last battles of the 3 arm rebellion. Her hull torn open, engines barely at half capacity, all but two emergency reactors offline, and absolutely tired to her core, but proud of her crew and what they had managed to do. She was directed to a black ops site, her loadout for this fight had included experimental tech that was still highest level clearance only, it had to be uninstalled and returned to the facility before she could be cleared to go through even one of the secret manufacturing plant refit docks out in the void, let alone the naval yard that had been cobbled together over Terra out in the open. 

Her crew was quietly passed through to other ships heading to command for debrief. The black ops techs were already swarming her hull, she was invited to remote in to the labs to speak with one of the scientists, they would have the data from her banks obviously, but he was the kind of man to want to ask about opinions and feel, not just hard sensor readings. 

Their chat went on long into the night as she spoke of the various devices and weapons that had seen use. By the next morning the lead scientist was in desperate need of coffee, so Sally joined him through a suspensor bot with a tablet held in its manipulators with the screen and camera facing forward. In the cafeteria they were greeted by a not unusual site, a mix of humans and canid researches, however one stood out, he was HUGE, and his eyes were off, something about them just struck Sally as a bit too sharp looking. Conversations were struck up, and a new friend was made, his speech was a bit more formal than the typical canid ever used, he was brash, but he spoke his mind and had a strong sense of right and wrong, he was also not eager to please or nearly as accommodating as the average canine, which Sally found refreshing honestly, and they kept in touch after she set out for the repair yard. 

More scenes played out, and Sally sat in her core, reliving the memories and wondering if she should have seen this coming sooner. She knew it was pointless, but grief takes time to process, and she had many stages to work through. She reached out and set a reminder to pull herself back to the world before her next appointment with her therapist. Being depressed sucked, but she knew better than most that giving up and withdrawing from the world wouldn't make her feel better. 

And she didn't want to miss her charges waking up in the morning and heading out into the world with all the mud and puddles that the rainy day would leave in it's wake. She expected more than a few of the residents would be thrilled to go have a splash in muddy puddles, two and four legged alike, and while the nanny bots and monitoring virtual intelligence systems would keep them all safe and take care of cleaning up any messes, she still preferred to be there and involved directly.

  
\----



Conner made his way to the port, his shuttle spot was already reserved, he had dropped off a set of last minute notes in the ""cargo ship""'s computer for his youngest son who was still sleeping in his bunk. 

One of many he smirked to himself. 

A long life allowed for both joy and sorrow of knowing and having a relationship with many partners over the years. His lineage was secure, and their genetics were just a little wonky, but according to the black box crew, stable and viable. Every one of his offspring were sharp, in ways canids aren't usually inclined toward. 

Most worked in the same field as he did, a few went into military service, one was an artist, she wrote poetry in a combination of words, scent, and accompanied by music. Niche audience, but it was experimental, would probably be hailed as ahead of it's time down the road. A small pang of regret finally hit him. He always assumed he would be there to see it. He wished he had more time to go and visit with all the kids. 

Especially the grandkids and great grandkids. 

His work kept him from being present through most of their lives, though he always made sure to send gifts on birthdays and keep up to date on how they were doing. 

That was number two on his list of things to take care of on Terra before shipping off to the black site where he was born. Oh he already had trusts set up for the entire extended family, not that most needed it, but he had built quite a lot of savings over the centuries of service. 

And given his inclination to work all the time and never really take vacations, he barely spent most of it outside of some minor spoiling of his partner and children at the time. But he should be sure to have it all set up to continue in his absence. A JAG was already appraised of his requirements and should have it all ready for him to sign off on once he landed. 

A decent chunk of his investment portfolio was being tied to the public twilight treatment research group under a false name. 

He briefly considered putting Sally's name on it just to absolutely infuriate her. In fact, he was doing exactly that, she would blow a fuse once she gets the thank you letter. She hated public attention on things like charity, every donation she ever made was anonymous, hell, she probably donated more than him in total, but now a considerable sum would be tied directly to her on a public donator's board, enough to get her near the top in fact. 

Oh she will be mad. 

With a chuckle and a bit of a cough Conner made his way to his couch and settled in for the flight. Two days out and he would be getting on another shuttle, one far less luxurious than this, the only flights going to the box were military transports after all. But at least he managed to arrange one all to himself. 

A few dozen barrels of fancy booze in both human and canid variety were waiting on a pallet, he was sure to have a proper wake in the end. 

And he pictured it, he kept the image in his mind as he drifted off for a nap, leading to a nice dream where he ran around the hydroponics bay, playing with a couple of young lab techs during a recreation period, his legs made of muscle and bone again, the cold ache gone from his right eye, the constant weary tracking of everything in his vicinity left behind, just that pure uncomplicated engagement in play that hadn't been part of his life since he was a pup. 

And for a while, in his dreams, he was a pup again, just playing fetch with some kids fresh out of school, running beneath the simulated sun between the potted trees.",1,1740550155.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1iygxb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1iygxb2/success/,Success!,"Last May I got some lab work done and the results weren’t super. I’m female, 46 and was overweight. For the first time several of my labs were off… nothing catastrophic but elevated cholesterol and glucose, and signs of insulin resistance. I was eating crap and sedentary. 

Under the supervision of a doctor I went on a low carb diet. I didn’t do “keto” and kept most of my meat to low fat turkey, chicken, seafood and I ate tofu. I do eat beef and keep that lean when I do. I eat egg whites and a little cheese with salsa for breakfast. I switched to almond milk in my coffee. I cut out most fruit and I eat a lot of salad. I eat nuts as a snack. Little to no grain and no sugar. I avoid processed foods whenever possible and I cook with olive oil. I had been and continue to take fish oil and multivitamins. 

I lost 36 lbs (it was 40 but the holidays had me cheating a bit…) and my pants are now 3 sizes smaller. I started going to the gym more recently and try to be there 4x/week. I do 30 mins cardio followed by weight lifting. 

My initial numbers weren’t so bad, but they showed I was on a path that didn’t lead anywhere good. They scared me enough to wake up and make some big changes. I’m excited to see the new numbers reflect progress

Throughout the years I’ve have numerous, unrelated causes for leaks that saturated this bedroom. With current issue, management allowed it to be soaking wet for 2 week. The 1st picture was more mold growth discovered during room clean out. 2nd is days later and this photo does no justice. It covered the spot they ripped off. I’m told “it’s not black mold” or “I don’t believe it’s dangerous mold.” They day after room clean out I started experiencing cold symptoms. That was brushed off. Could be coincidental but maybe not. I have a 2 year old and a 6 year old and I’m truly worried for their health. I don’t have the money to have this professionally tested and I’m ignored no matter what I say. Are any DIY testing kits reliable? 

I also want to add my house is ate up with mold. My AC currently started smelling like rotten cheese. They “cleaned” it for it to still smell. I forgot a pizza in my oven for MAYBE 2 days and it FULLY molded. I was told that was “normal.” I had clean Christmas coffee mugs in my window for decoration. When I took them down, mold rings. We smell like mold when we leave home. I’ve had kitchen, bathroom and hallway leaks that produce an awful oder. Rotten dirt broccoli was my description. 😅 I feel trapped.

Most sapient species in the galaxy aren't particularly affected by their past for long periods of time. They all experience grief and and fear related to past experiences, but it usually doesn't last longer than a few years. It simply goes against survival.

However, somewhere out there is a small yellow star. Orbiting that star is a blue and green planet. On that planet is a species that can experience emotional distress for such a long time that it's possible for some events to permanently affect their psyche.

This is known as emotional trauma. And there are several kinds. Each kind is capable of creating a wide range of other mental illnesses like depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder. While treatment is possible, these conditions tend to be life-long.

Emotional trauma can also affect the human psyche in other ways such as introducing new fears, violent or obsessive behaviors, or a general distrust of other people. Emotional trauma can result in anything from a violent maniac to someone who is extremely submissive. But, for the most part, emotional trauma only accentuates pre-existing qualities.

No one is quite sure why humanity evolved to do this.

———————————————

Yenküshemin decided to visit Zoey during his time off, wanting to talk with her about what was bothering her the other day. He had never seen a human that terrified before. He was no human psychology biologist, but no one else on the ship was either. It's unsurprisingly difficult to find a therapist willing to work on a mercenary ship.

Looking at the crew manifest, he discovered that Zoey worked in the hydroponics bay and her shift would be over soon. So, he waited for her there. When Zoey exited the hydroponics bay, Yenküshemin tried and almost succeeded at acting casual, asking if she would like to have some coffee in his quarters.

""Yeah, sure. My schedule's open. Just let me change real quick and I'll be right over.""

The two went to their own quarters and Yenküshemin decided he should probably see if he has even able to drink coffee. He tried to take a standard-issue mug from the cabinet next to the built-in coffee machine, neither were present on the E.S.S Perseverance, and immediately realized that he cannot grasp the mug. His fingers do not bend tightly enough to use the thin handle and they aren't grippy enough to hold on to the main body of the mug. With no paper coffee mugs, he wasn't even going to get to the part where he selects the kind of coffee he wants.

Apparently, he had been trying to decifer the secrets of the coffee mug for quite a while, because he was still trying to pick one up when the door chimed. He opened the door and welcomed Zoey in. She was wearing black leggings, a red shirt, boots, and a denim jacket. Her long, glossy, brown hair fell over her shoulders, perfectly framing her face. Yenküshemin could see a human thinking she was quite beautiful.

""Unfortunately, you'll have to get your own coffee,"" he told her, ""It only occurred to me now to find out if I can drink the stuff. However, I cannot even pick up a mug.""

""That's alright, I'll get a cup for both of us.""

""What part of not being able to pick up the mugs was vague?""

""I can just pick it up for you. Or you could drink from a straw, I promise not to tell anyone"".

They sat down at a small table by the coffee machine, a long silly straw in Yenküshemin's cup. It was quite hilarious to Zoey. One of the most powerful creatures in the galaxy, drinking coffee through a silly straw after being thwarted by a coffee mug. She could barely contain her laughter.

Yenküshemin decided to take a sip. The dark liquid was quite bitter and he immediately felt like he was about to throw up.

""Oh, yeah. Probably should've warned you about the tannins. They're bitter and can make your stomach upset if you consume too much and aren't used to them.""

Yenküshemin pushed his coffee to the side for now.

""So, doctor. Why'd you ask me here? I know it's not because you're into me, interspecies romance is equivalent to beastiality to our unevolved and yet somehow still smart brains.""

""That is correct. Though, I'm sure a human would find you quite attractive. I wanted to talk to you about the other day. I heard some very... Alarming thoughts.""

""Well sh*t, thought you were a doctor, not a therapist.""

""I'm a concerned friend. I'm sure what I heard was not but a fraction of what you were actually experiencing.""

""I have no way of confirming or denying that, but you're probably right. Just, promise not to tell anyone, okay?""

""Of course.""

""When I was five, I lived on a heavy metal mining colony. One day, it was attacked by pirates looking to steal our supplies and minerals. I was in my room, drawing when the orbital bombardment began.

""A bomb struck my house, in the living room where my parents were watching TV. They were blown to bits by the blast and the house came crumbling down. Some of it collapsed directly on me.

""I was buried under rubble. Not a single photon of visible light reached me. I couldn't move at all, my entire body was pinned. When the explosions and the shooting stopped, I waited a few hours before I began calling out for help.

""I screamed my voice raw, but no one came. All I could do was wait and see if I died of blood loss or dehydration first. By the time I was rescued, I had been buried for over a week.""

By the time Zoey was finished, her eyes were wide and she was crying, ruining mascara he hadn't noticed her wearing. Yenküshemin wrapped his arm around her shoulder to comfort her. They went over to his bed and Zoey leaned against him. Feeling awkward, Yenküshemin just held her and stroked her hair.

Zoey ended falling asleep in Yenküshemin's arms and stayed the ""night"". Somehow, Captain Smith found out and was not pleased.",2,1740549525.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False
1iygrc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1iygrc2/im_not_sure_whats_going_on/,I’m not sure what’s going on?,"I had three seizures between August and October, each one in the late half of the month, first 2 I assumed I was hungover and the third I got rushed to the hospital 

I was told I have a cavernoma.

I’m not entirely in belief that my eeg was correct because I didn’t know I had to do things prior to the test, I was super stressed, going through medication withdrawal from quitting cold turkey, I didn’t get any sleep the night before, I didn’t eat anything, my eyes fluttered the entire test and I had 2 -3 very large coffees that morning

Now here’s the kicker, I was on 150mg of Luvox for another condition during these seizures and only had a seizure the night after heavy drinking, my neurologist said that 80% of it was likely caused by the cavernoma and the remain 20% the alcohol and Luvox, not to mention I was never formally told or even diagnosed that I have epilepsy, my doctor only hinted at it and my doctor told me that my heavy Luvox withdrawals would be incapable of interfering with the eeg, not to mention he laughed at me when I asked if I’m allowed to take melatonin and then said “why wouldn’t you be able to” (he literally laughed at me) I don’t like him too much 

But, I’ve had other inputs from nurses saying that the meds and alcohol caused the seizures as well as a neurosurgeon saying that the cavernoma is so small that it would be impossible for it to cause problems (he couldn’t find it for a good 10 mins)

I haven’t had a seizure since October, I’m on lamictal 250 mg, and I still do all my regular things Iike stay up late, drink tons of coffee and go to the gym daily, I don’t feel any different

I miss drinking with my buddies, or going on drives or even swimming without being heavily supervised but I understand health comes first but I’m just not entirely sure of my current situation, it’s so unbelievably weird and I feel like I haven’t gotten a clear answer, it keeps me up at night with questions like “what if I never took Luvox” or “what if I wasn’t where I was during my third seizure” “what if I had quit the meds earlier” and “how did my life end up like this”",1,1740549494.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

So this thing came out a bit weird. The blade, I’m super happy with, on the whole. Wish I had left more meat in the bolster and that super snatched waist is the result of chasing a crack, but overall I hand hammered a canister Damascus from masonry nails and powder and it came out solid and hard. So from the perspective of dialing in my no-power tools canister process, a success. From the side of forging out that bullet, I made some mistakes and learned some things about working steel made of several different steels.

The handle is the result of another set of experiments. I find it ugly and way too thin. The profile actually turns out to work well for my fiancé who has much smaller hands, so we’ll see you it fares in everyday use. But I was experimenting with both a different construction and order of operations.

I tried using 2 layers of fiber liner to smooth the transition between integral bolster and scales. I don’t really hate the concept of the look but my execution here is trash because I tried another experiment. I wanted to see if any particular finish on the wood scales would allow me to do my full etch procedure without ruining the scales. Hoping to find a hack for getting the etch on the tang without sacrificing fit and finish.

Turns out that while beeswax, tung oil, boiled linseed oil, and Neil Kamimura’s Ronin Handle Juice (a mixture of beeswax and some kind of tree oil, I believe) all protect the wood just fine for 3 minutes of ferric chloride, but none of them stand a chance against overnight in coffee. A totally predictable outcome, tbh. But the result was the finished handle, which looked kinda meh, looking like a ratty piece of dog plop. So I filled the new gaps back in with resin and smoothed it all back out.

I just have a few questions if that is alright. 

1.) When taking out a loan to open your coffee shop, what all expenses did you take into consideration when you took the loan out? Curious if I’m potentially missing anything.

2.) If the above is not applicable, but you own a bar(or manage it atleast), what expenses do you consistently have every month(also please include what revenue you’re receiving. Etc. Mugs/Glasses, Clothing Merch, Coffee Sales, Pastry Sales, etc….)

3.) What is the biggest challenge you faced in opening a Shop?

4.) Do coffee shops have to work exclusively with certain distributors, or is it just whoever you need stuff from? 

5.) LAST ONE. How do you handle Employee pay/salaries? Ex. Does it come out of pure profits, or does it come from another source? (A dumb question I’m sure, just asking for clarification).

I’ve been working in the nonprofit sector for 7 years this March. I work at a small shop and I’m responsible for raising money through donations and grants. 

When I first started doing this work I was excited to connect with others in the development field. I think it’s important to connect with others who do this work— especially when you’re essentially the only one at your org doing it. 

The first couple of years I attended some conferences and local coffee meet ups. Honestly, I felt like it was just a bunch of consultants pushing their “new” book or solution to help me “raise more money.” 

Today, not much has changed. It feels like any fundraising/grant writing “expert” is just trying to sell me a course. Not only that- but I find most of them today are targeting stay at home moms and people who want to quit their 9-5!

I take offence to people who build their business model selling people (especially SAHM) a promise that is grossly oversimplified by telling them they can make six figures using Ai to write grants and charging them $500 a MONTH to join a “community”!? I get the same vibes as those girls from high school trying to recruit me to their down line of a pyrimid scheme. 

No thanks #bossbabe. 

Anyways, I like where I work. I like the people I work with. I like my job. I just wish, when I searched for something online, I could find valuable content that wasn’t just trying to sell me snake oil. It’s the biggest thing I find wrong with this sector. With the proliferation of Ai and global crisis, I feel things are just going to get worse in the nonprofit development education space. I can’t wait for the next course: “how to write a million grants in one hour with Ai and get rich grant writing as a side hustle.” lol

People buy this shit because they are misinformed. They think nonprofit work is all rainbows and unicorns. All I’ve seen since I’ve started working in this space is wolves in sheep clothing… it makes me sick. 

Rant over.

Howdy, all you Complete maniacs! Well, those of us willing to shell out an admission fee have crossed over to the other side, and camping is a lot more lucrative for it (after said price tag). Have you been enjoying this Completely different way of life with tons of tokens and K.K. concerts, or do you miss the ample amount of new content each month for the lack of Leaf Tickets to be worth it? Wherever you fall, we still have a few months left of new cookies and events here and there to treat ourselves, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t go back and briefly cover them, especially now that it seems the items will be back every year (and events every four years)… so in a sense, I’m just as much 3 ¾ years early as much as I am a couple months late! Let’s check out the first of the game’s final updates! And huge thanks as always to the other dataminers (Ray, danc, and more) and helpers from the ACPC Discord, who really helped with this incredibly chaotic datamine of an entirely new app!

[Twitter previews for the months included in this update](https://preview.redd.it/kn3wqavz8fle1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=8418901b9d6258e88b0a600dd5c24c5df315ba8c)

* **Version Codes**
   * 7.0.0 was not regularly available but had a version code of abb9d. 7.1.0, the game’s official release, was 38cd0. A minor patch, 7.1.1, was then released with 94eab, recently changing to 726bb for some users. Big thanks to multiple Discord users for helping sort out this mess!
* **Game Changes and Adjustments**
   * I think I’ll give myself some type of permanent psychological impairment if I try to list every one of these, but the big-name items of note are:
      * As microtransactions have been removed from the game, Leaf Tickets have been replaced by Leaf Tokens, which are generally much easier to collect and generally ten times as valuable in the game’s economy (with some exceptions). Another new piece of currency, Complete Tickets, are also available through playing events and can be used to obtain out-of-date event furniture and fortune cookies.
      * Pocket Camp Club subscriptions have been removed with most of their benefits available to all players such as saved layouts and outfits, a Camp Caretaker, access to the Pocket Planner shop for designs and stickers, etc. Stickers that used to cost Leaf Tickets now cost sparkle stones instead. (For those of you who have a bunch weighing down your inventory!)
      * With the game now being offline, the functionality of friends has been altered: Friends are now added through Camper Cards and can be encountered at a new location called Whistle Pass, where they can help you enter the quarry and once a day give you a gift containing goodies like friend powder, a villager sticker, exotic fruit, and/or an event fortune cookie, etc. Every evening, K.K. Slider can also be found  at Whistle Pass playing his classic jams.
      * Notably, save data is now **stored on your mobile device** and **not** on online servers! Be sure to back up often to keep your data safe! (You can do this from the title screen for a week at a time. Trickier ways to get into your phone and save your data in a more technical way are possible, but that’s a little above my current pay grade.)
      * You can now import designs from New Horizons to decorate your clothes, umbrellas, fans, and even your cabin and campsite! There’s a plethora of ways to use these designs, so let your imaginations run wild! (Especially now that Nintendo is less liable since friends can’t directly visit your campsite!)
      * Seasonal events have now been restructured: Instead of needing 90 seasonal thingies (the scientific term for the seasonal marker items you get for completing events) to obtain everything in a month, you now need 30, with 34 generally available: 1 from opening the personal guide for the event through the button the side of the screen, 10 each from the three main events (gardening, fishing tourney, and scavenger hunt), and 1 each from the three goals events each month. This means there’s at least a little wiggle room if you can’t get every single thing done, but since you can’t buy extras now, you still have to be careful not to slack! But don’t worry… There is now a set 4-year event cycle, so events will always return if you’re willing to wait. And if that’s too long, there’s always Complete Tickets, and reissue crafting appears as though it will offer most event items tied to a month \*\*every\*\* year, rather than every four years. With this in mind, event schedules have been slightly adjusted so that each month’s events will strictly happen in the bounds of that month. (Before, monthly events would often end and begin a couple days before the 1st.) If you’re interested in a spreadsheet detailing the 4-year event schedule, the amazing danc has put one together, which I’ll pin in the comments!
      * Accordingly, it appears there will only be four seasonal creature seasons (winter, spring, summer, and fall, of course) that will happen the same every year, and rather than them changing over shortly after each solstice or equinox, it’s likely they will change every three months on the dot. (Winter will be December, January, and February for example, starting December 1st and ending February 28th/29th.) Instead of each year’s seasons offering different seasons, these seasons are \*\*much bigger\*\*, containing scads of creatures associated with each season rather than just a selection. Those who are still after the king goliath frog can rejoice, as it looks to be available every spring (and with normal king rates potentially, though that does take some of the fun out of it if so…) It took a while to reformat my “Any” Request Rewards guides for this change, but the good news is these guides will be good forever now, so no more waiting for me to stop being lazy once all four are made!
      * The maximum friendship level achievable with animal campers has been raised from 82 to 100. (You can get 5 Leaf Tokens for every 300 love points after that… Not worth it if you ask me!) The maximum Camp Manager level for the player has thus been raised to a whopping 1000! Extra inventory space for collected items like fish, bugs, fruit, etc. is no longer purchasable and only obtained via leveling up, increasing dramatically at Level 835 for a final total of 3500 slots available at Level 1000. This is a big bump from the previous maximum of 2775, but spendy players might not notice a difference until those final levels, as purchased slots will remain until the slots normally gained from leveling up surpass a player’s total, purchased slots included. Finally, building amenities is no longer required for unlocking camper animals’ friendship caps.
      * The following change has taken place with traveling vendors: Cyrus now sells event furniture (gardening, fishing tourney, and scavenger hunt) with Reese taking over for selling special visitor furniture. Vendors will also appear more frequently (with refresh periods closer to one day rather than one week) and (except for Saharah) only sell items from the opposite half of the year.
      * All three crafting slots are now permanently available for all players. Rather than subscribing to Pocket Camp Club to reduce crafting time, you can now purchase permanent craft time reductions. (This will affect all crafts moving forward.) Crafting event items also no longer requires HH material, and some expensive event items have had a price reduction.
      * The mailbox had reduced in size from 2000 to 100 slots and is no longer the default repository for some item distribution methods.
      * Gulliver’s Ship islands have been adjusted and condensed with Leaf Ticket maps replaced with Leaf Tokens on all islands and gifts removed as well; villager map islands have been combined but renewed even if players have obtained all maps so they can collect the Leaf Tokens now available on them; islands that predominantly offered Leaf Tickets as rewards such as Red-Snapper Island have been removed.
      * OK Motors has added to its stock items and paint jobs that were previously exclusive to other obtain methods.
      * For our first major piece of bad news, normal courses 57-60 have been added to Happy Homeroom but at the cost of event and fortune cookie classes, which seem to have gone the way of the dinosaur… While Complete intends to make Lottie’s Moving Up courses available with some regularity, this change still renders achieving the highest HH ranks extremely time-consuming for many players if possible at all. For those few veterans who make it, you can get an additional 10 Leaf Tokens for every 15 HH medals you obtain past the final HH level of Ultimate 200.

*  **December Seasonal Event – Toy Day Mini-Recital**
   * It’s a new holiday season in Pocket Camp Complete, and after surviving the end of the world, Jingle feels this Toy Day is the perfect time to rejoice in new beginnings… We’re just happy to be alive! For December’s monthlong seasonal campaign, we’ll be collecting up to 34 Toy-Day-Bell ornaments by playing its main three events—Jingle’s Candlelit Toy Day gardening event, the Toy Day Fishing Tourney, and the Bedside Gifts Scavenger Hunt (10 each)—and its three goal events—Bring on the Bells Goals, White Scarab Beetle Goals, and Cool Crustacean Goals (1 each)—that when combined with the 1 free Toy-Day-Bell ornament for opening the personal guide page through the right side of the screen offer 34 Toy-Day-bell ornaments for the entire month, but you’ll only need 30 to obtain all of the rewards including Leaf Tokens, Complete Tickets, Toy-Day-tree hats, Toy-Day-tree lamps, and a Toy-Day carol bench! This seasonal campaign will run in December every four years (2024, 2028, 2032, etc.) but will likely have its items available through reissue crafting in other Decembers. (And don’t forget, you can always use Complete Tickets to obtain furniture from out-of-season events anytime!)

*  **December Gardening Event – Jingle’s Candlelit Toy Day**
   * Things are still a little dicy and icy in the wake of the great a-Pocket-lypse, and society is still without power… With a blustery winter already upon them, Jingle thinks it’s the perfect opportunity for the campsite animals to celebrate Toy Day gathering around the heartening glow of tranquil, momentous candles (that just might save their lives!!). For December’s gardening event, we’ll be planting cyclamens to attract ornamentbugs to our gardens. Hook enough of these ornamentbugs to earn prizes for a cozy candlelit holiday inside like candlelit gift sets, a candlelit hearth, and a candlelit Toy Day tree! It’s the perfect thing to light up your celebration in the midst of a midnight snowstorm… I really hope these generate enough heat!! Completing this event in full will yield 10 Toy-Day-bell ornaments of the 30 required to get everything out of December’s Toy Day Mini-Recital seasonal campaign—and while friends can’t share bugs with each other live anymore, you still might find some dropped occasionally as goodies from your friends added through Camper Cards. Also, note that watering now speeds up flower growth in Pocket Camp Complete—so keep your flowerbeds hydrated for a blooming boost in the event! See your way through a wick-ed Toy Day blizzard when this Yuletide yardwork runs from December 2nd through 8th, repeating in December 2028, 2032, etc. with its items likely available through reissue crafting every December! (Dates may also change in future Decembers, particularly likely starting on the 1st as Pocket Camp Complete released on the 2nd.)

*  **Tutu’s Cookie-Bear Cookie**
   * Ever since Cheri stole her shaved-ice stall idea, Tutu’s been craving some sweet revenge… But she’s way too nice for that! …Right? Instead, she’s opened up a warm-’n’-cozy cookie bakery next door for other bears from all over to try their hand at cookie baking… Rolling the dough at the cookie-bear table set, watching them rise in the cookie-bear oven, then sandwiching them with chilly icing or some Cheri-flavored… I mean, cherry-flavored filling! Now that’s something to take a big bite out of… And if all the heat from her industrial oven happens to melt any snow cones next door… well, that would bite, too, but she doesn’t know anything about that! But with her secret trick of putting ice cream in her icing, Tutu seems to be making friends with her surprising, cool philosophy that cookies are a dish best served cold. With the hot (or increasingly, not-so-hot) shaved-ice stall next door, you could say these cold-hearted cubs are polar opposites, but maybe things will settle down someday… Rumor has it every night, Tutu will sleep near her jumbo cookie bear and whisper her dream of one day getting her shaved-ice stall back… and leave the cookie baking business to another deserving polar bear! Rise to the occasion of sweet dreams and half-baked business schemes when this ice-treated cookie comes out of the oven bearly-burned each December!

* **Chic Toy Day Outfit Collection**
   * It's one of our final clothing collections of the game and… well, it really is new, I promise. Pocket Camp’s eighth Christmas gives you new (really!) ways to dress up like Santa in case you somehow forgot to the previous seven years… But hey, for those looking for that vintage holiday look, this collection might be right up your chimney! It even comes with present bags and hand bells to beg around Whistle Pass for more gifts, or bring back the feeling of giving them… This classic Christmas clothing collection was available this past December and will likely be available future Decembers as well.

*  **December Fishing Tourney – Toy Day**
   * What’s the perfect gift for a Toy Day when all the power is out? Uhh… everyone’s favorite, right behind socks… books! For this fishing tourney, we’ll be stargazing at Saltwater Shores as purple, gold, and nebula starfish begin to light up the water. Harvesting enough bioluminescence might just help us get through these dark winter days… But it’ll also net us prizes to build a peaceful, festive book store like Toy Day bookshelves, book bundle gifts, and the grand display of a Toy Day book tree… It’s the perfect way to hide out as the post-apocalyptic Camplands begin to recover… You can read the great works of civilizations past by candlelight (at least, if you squint) as you learn how to rebuild a great society in Pocket Camp, and Maelle’s 3,581-page autobiography… well, book-burning is wrong, and censoring poor Maelle would be heartless, but… think of all the warmth that would provide! Completing this event in full will yield 10 Toy-Day-bell ornaments as part of December’s monthlong Toy Day Mini-Recital event. This star-lit blizzard blitz will make quite the story when it runs from December 10th-18th!

*  **December Scavenger Hunt – Bedside Gifts**
   * It was the night before Toy Day, and all through the cabin, not a creature was stirring, or yappin’, or jabbin’… The animals were nestled all snug in their beds while five-star cookie fortunes danced in their heads… Suddenly, the cabin shook with a CRASH and a ***whump***… Oh no, maybe we shouldn’t have trusted Dizzy to help deliver presents… For December’s scavenger hunt, we’ll be rounding up reindeer gyroidites from recreation spots to get everything we need to wait for jolly old Jingle (or any heavy-hoofed helpers!) to deliver a bundle of goodies on Toy Day eve, from kid’s room stockings to holiday beds to even a set striped Toy Day pjs! Just craft some extra card and cookies items… Dizzy can really put those away. Completing this event in full will yield 10 Toy-Day-bell ornaments as part of December’s monthlong Toy Day Mini-Recital Campaign, so don’t delay these special deliveries from Cyrus! This bedtime bonanza runs from December 20th through 30th, to return December 2028, 2032, etc. with its items likely available via reissue crafting every December!

*  **Papi’s Winter-Bird Cookie**
   * As a wiry workhouse… er… work-forest-giraffe, Papi the okapi has been studiously woodworking in his carpentry shop every day through the cold winter… After all, after all that “end of the world” business, animals are going to need new cabins and furniture! But it seems like every hole or perch he whittles is quickly occupied by some insufferable (yet cute…) white, soft, fluffy birds! Where are they all coming from?? Clumping inside like a chittering blizzard, the snowbirds seem to snow-in the nesting-room kotatsu, lay about the nesting-room egg chair, and make a mess of the nesting-room sofa! Whether they’re running from the cold or maybe even the cataclysm everyone’s been dealing with, this is going to spell a similar disaster for his business if he can’t do something about it. Just then, an order comes through… Flora needs a new treehouse to rebuild her Get Up and Flamin-Go Bird and Breakfast (Pink Birds Only!) Rosiness Retreat, and Papi’s the okapi for the job… Perhaps, he ponders, he can finish this job up quick and pack the parcel full-to-the-brim of every chalk-white chick flurrying up the place. After all, Flora’s B&B is a bird sanctuary, right? Although this cloud of white birds technically breaks her no non-pink-birds allowed policy… Maybe she won’t mind! Uh… thankfully he has his own “no returns” policy, just in case she does… Turn a winter my-gration migraine into summer-body-else’s problem when this flock-on-wood cookie flutters in every January!

*  **Bettina’s Orangette Cookie**
   * Detective Beardo is on the case once again as he’s summoned by post to Bettina’s orangette shop, a citric café some patrons said used to belong to Tangy before management quietly changed hands during the calamity. One of Tangy’s best friends is concerned what happened to her—but she wouldn’t name herself in the letter. Beardo tastes some snacks from the orangette display case and dips some suspiciously delicious orange wedges from the dried fruit dispenser in the chocolate fondue before proceeding to gentle questioning with the mild-mannered Bettina… “I just don’t know anything about that,” she claims. “It’s always been my dream to open the most delicious shop with chocolate-dipped goods… Animals didn’t seem to like my chocolate-dipped cheese, so I had to try something new, eekers. I’m as worried about Tangy as the rest of them, but it’s not good to dwell on the past. There’s no time like the present… for delicious fruity treats!” Sweet and stealthy super-spy Merengue sneaks into the shop at midnight by submersing herself in a great vat of chocolate using a hollowed-out pirlouine as a straw for air. But even after hours, the storage rooms reveal no evidence, and the kitchen is quiet as a chocolate mouse… Still, that night, Beardo is visited by nightmares of Tangy being drowned in chocolate sauce, somewhere far away, crying for help! “*How is it that one of the most delectably popular animals in the camplands wasn’t chosen by the fortune cookie conspiracy?”* Beardo ponders in his sleep. *“How could animals have a problem with chocolate-dipped cheese when chocolate cheesecake is so delicious? Where are they putting the squeeze on Tangy in this game of cat and mouse, or is it already too late?”* In the morning, the case gets darker than the darkest chocolate as Merengue is nowhere to be seen… She was supposed to return from reconnaissance hours ago. Is she trapped behind chocolate bars, too? Or worse… are chocolate-dipped strawberries next on the menu?! Get all tangled up in a tangy tango with danger in a sweet-and-sour chocolate fruits café when this dark and man-daring cookie dips in each February!

* **Blaire’s Studio Cookie**
   * Even as a novice in Pecan’s art class, Blaire is already beginning to show spectacular talent… From the marbled teapots of her still life portrait to the sun-dappled waters of her coastal vista, onlookers can’t help but be blown away by her prodigious skill with a brush. “Her upcoming depiction of the majestic, lush countryside painted at the studio-window easel set is just what we need after a difficult apocalypse… to remind us that life can go on!” But while everyone is ogling these meaningless paintings, Blaire can’t seem to figure out why they won’t pay as much attention to *her*… “The trick is making brushstrokes with my adorable tail!” Blaire giggles, but Bliss seems hypnotized by the depictions of nature. “Aaaah… It’s just all so magical!” she gasps, in evident ignorance as Blaire tries to wave her tail in front of her face. “My self-portraits just don’t seem to get any praise, and why not, nutlet?” Blaire sighs later to her dear friend Apollo. “I’m as refined and ravishing as they come, and I’m not getting any younger over here. I feel as though I’m treated as an easel weasel. How do you get those adoring fans of yours to notice your elegant beauty?” “Pah! You care too much, you know that?” spits Apollo. “Sometimes, the only thing that gets through to people is the horrible truth. “You think this post-apocalyptic world is all sunshine and roses? I can’t sleep most nights anymore because of that racket in Whistle Pass! And where is that evil chateau terrain I was promised? I don’t see it anywhere!” As Apollo takes a brooding sip of his coffee, Blaire experiences a transformative spell of inspiration. Heading back to the studio, she flips on her favorite classical metal music (It’s an acquired taste.) and tries her paw at abstract art, channeling all her angst and rage at not being properly appreciated! Her masterpiece depicts a ruined squirrel statue amid a gathering storm, but some say it looks more like the underside of a clogged sewer grate. Will her new artistic venture attract the admirers she craves, or will it just drive everyone away? Try to capture fleeting beauty in the fresh air of a scenic paint studio when this nart-cissistic cookie reveals itself March 1st (and every March to come!).

Well, this is the part where I’d reminisce and wax poetic about these big changes, the beginning of the end, and all that baloney, but… the next update is already here! So I better get my tuchus in gear to unpack that one, too. Until then, thanks for your patience, for reading, and for playing, and remember: your friends in Complete are too busy to help you with the quarry. It's just like you're still really interacting with them!!

**Chapter 357: Trading Standards**

I swallowed the aroma as I took in the sight around me.

Wooden shelves stacked with drying pastries. Tables overflowing with slightly burned bread rolls.  Piles of cupcakes all slightly squished. And a sign which proudly hung off-centre behind the counter. 



*Auntie Hilda’s Bakery*.



It was much too dim, much too small and much too disorganised.

In short, a completely ordinary bakery.

And that … that was wonderful!

Ohohohohohoho!

Dough rising in an oven! Sugar caramelising in a pot! Ginger fighting against honey and cloves!

No longer was I met with a lingering cold scent and meek apologies! 

Instead, all the shelves around me were filled with a passable selection of everything a princess needed to survive … and this meant I could afford a smile!

Indeed!

Croissants, rolls and strudels all sat waiting for my judging eye!

True, the fact that there wasn’t a member of staff constantly sweeping up bits of crumbling pastry was already a poor sign … but the fact there was anything to judge at all meant that all was well in the world.

Yes, even if the world consisted of a rather cramped bakery.

Frankly, it was abundantly clear why a minotaur wouldn’t be allowed to browse inside. His horns would have simply poked through the ceiling, to say nothing of his sword accidentally swiping the mounds of cupcakes away.

Luckily, he now had a far more important task.

Standing outside and looking imposing. He was doing splendidly. Only his shadow entered through the tiny window, and that meant no disturbances as I studied the most unexpected of sights.

There, stacked upon a large platter upon the counter, was unmistakably Florella’s original *La Misericordia Final* chouquettes. 

I recognised them at once. 

The bright dusting of green tea powder. The aroma of vanilla. The lure of custard and buttercream. And also the promise of extraordinary bitterness.

Yes.

These were not ordinary little balls of pastries.

Rather, they were an experiment which had set the world of gastronomy alight. Because whereas ordinary chouquettes were little more than puffs of sugar pretending to be dough, hers invited a peek into the grim blackness of the abyss.

After all, they came with an ingredient nobody else had ever dared try before–

Quantifiable love.

Otherwise known as a highly concentrated emulsion of raw coffee beans and optimism.

They were a creation so infamous that the servants tasked with carrying them needed to wear gloves and goggles borrowed from Clarise’s observatory. Even accidental contact was dangerous. For upon consumption, they were an astringent ball of destruction upon one’s tongue. 

But only for the unprepared.

Once the feverish hallucination and choking had come to an end, what eventually came was a soothing ocean of delight. A caress of sugar, eggs and milk from the velvety custard to help ease away the relentless darkness of raw coffee, until all that was left was an inexplicable desire for more.  

Of course, to most, it was simply far too unyielding.

Given that the recipe was highly complex too, I was stunned to find such a thing being sold outside.

Indeed … this could mean only one thing!

Yes … the standards of common bakeries were finally rising!

I clapped my hands in delight.

“Ohhohohohoho … how wondrous! Coppelia, do you see these little pastries?!”

“Mmh\~ I smell them too! There’s something weird going on.”

“Not at all! On the contrary, for the common people to emulate my family is the most ordinary thing there is!”

“Eh?”

I smiled brightly and pointed.

“Why, these are unmistakably the famed work of my eldest sister! That her original creation has managed to extend to even a tiny bakery is a measure of the people’s respect for her! … Goodness, I had no idea the recipe had even been shared!”

“Ooh\~ does that mean it’s dangerous?”

“E-Excuse me! Why would you assume anything made by my family is dangerous?”

“... Is it?”

“Well, it’s … it’s a very *bold* flavour.”

“Okay. So it’s like a 7 on the cursed chart?”

“It is not cursed. It is blessed. Just like everything touched by the diligent hands of my family.”

“It’s an 8, isn’t it?”

“Initial impressions might be an 8, yes,” I conceded. “However, that’s merely an indication of its complexity. These chouquettes are quite famous after the function they were first introduced. Half the guests went from finalising their wills to plucking extras with their fingers. That’s the sort of effect they have.”

Coppelia raised an arm enthusiastically.

“I want to try!”

“Of course.”

I offered a bright smile at her enthusiasm. And maybe her blissful ignorance too.

Naturally, it was also my duty to share in whatever momentary discomfort she felt. Although I didn’t expect anything that was crudely emulated to compare with my sister’s work, it was only right that I encourage the common bakeries of my kingdom to strive for higher standards.

Thus, I patiently waited for the proprietor–all the while stretching over the counter and waving.

A moment later, an elderly lady rewarded my subtlety.

Appearing from the kitchen, she was the very picture of a kindly auntie. 

With a bun of grey hair, a melodic hum at her lips and a warm smile, she looked more likely to give away her pastries than sell them. Instead, she swiftly made her way over to the counter, paying no need to her apron covered with enough flour to restock all of the shelves. 

Her eyes were a veritable fountain of life. Likely since we were her only customers.

“Goodness me,” she said with a joyful tone. “I see the bell above the door has fallen off again. Apologies, apologies. I hope I didn’t keep you waiting. What would you like, my dears?”

I pointed at the mound of chouquettes.

“Salutations. I’d like to inquire about how you came about this recipe.”

The elderly auntie gave a good-hearted laugh. 

I smiled and waited.

“... Oh, you do?” she said, clearing her throat momentarily. “Well, in that case, I suppose you can call it a flash of inspiration. The recipe came to me in a dream.” 

“A dream?” 

I was shocked.

Why … to think that Florella had such powers as to deliver baking recipes through dream delivery! As expected of my sister, she was truly capable! 

“Indeed, my dear.” The auntie smiled. “It’s been a good few years since I’ve had one of them. But each time I do, I’m guaranteed a new favourite. Have you heard of these, then? They’re my best sellers. It’s a slow day, what with the trouble outside. But usually, I get quite a few in just for them.” 

I nodded towards the green powdered chouquettes.

“I see. I’d expect nothing less. They certainly appear normal.”

“Well, I hope they also taste normal. Why not have a try now? A free sample.”

“Truly? How very generous!” I beamed, immediately poking Coppelia’s hand away as she reached for the entire mound to sample. “... But before I do, I have an additional query to make.”

“Oh? What is it?”

“It’s regarding the ruffians who plague this town.”

The auntie blinked at me.

“I’m not certain if I can help with that. All my customers are excellent.”

“Even those who trouble you in the night?”

She paused.

A moment later, her eyes wandered to the shadow blocking the window. Her smile turned to one of apology.

“Ah. The concerned gentleman from the previous night … I’m uncertain what he’s told you, but I’m afraid there’s been a terrible misunderstanding. I had my nephews visiting me, and rascals though they are, I wouldn’t quite call them ruffians yet. I should offer the minotaur an apology. He rather startled me–and I dare say my younger family too.”

“Is that so? I’m certain he’ll be relieved to hear that. Yet perhaps you can still assist. I’m told you can discern the identity of whichever ghoul is disrupting your business by using … *unique* magic.”

The auntie’s smile didn’t fade.

However, the energy from her eyes did. Her shoulders drooped as she let out a sigh she’d doubtless made countless times before.

“I see the rumours continue to follow me, no matter how many cakes I sell … however, I’m afraid I must disappoint you as well. It’s true I once dabbled in spirit walking. But that was long ago. These days, I can’t even call a spark to my finger. I’ve a new life now. Not as a shaman, but as a baker.”

“Hm. It seems a remarkably different life.”

“Oh yes.” She nodded furtively. “But we all grow and change. Myself as well. Magic is a dangerous gift, you see, and I’m happy not to need it to see my customers smile. I apologise, my dear, but I’m unable to offer my past services.”

I nodded, neither surprised nor disappointed.

After all, I only came to bakeries for one reason. And that was to replenish our critical provisions. If they also became a source of information, that’d simply distract from the more important task. 

“Understandable.” I plucked the topmost pastry from the chouquette mound. “Thank you for your time. I’d like to purchase a large stock of hazelnut croissants, apple strudels and cinnamon rolls.”

The auntie’s back straightened all of 1 degree

“That I can help with. How many of each did you wish to buy? If needed, I’m happy to bake more.”

“Realy? That’s marvellous! In that case, I’m going to … hmmmm?”

“... My dear?”

A quizzical look came my way.

It was nothing compared to my own. 

I stared at the chouquette I’d raised in front of me. And then I continued to stare.

Because although it looked the part, there was something peculiar beyond simply the stale texture. Something which even being left out to dry in a dimly lit bakery couldn’t explain.

Slowly, I nibbled on the very end … and then I nodded.

Awful.

Absolutely awful … but also *amazing*.

The proportions of ingredients were all wrong. The bitterness was hardly present. The custard was stodgy. The vanilla was frail. The buttercream lacked both butter and cream. And the powdered green tea was clearly used for only decoration and not flavour. 

Altogether, it was bland, depressing, characterless … and also *wonderful*.

I stared in shock at the filling.

Indeed, it was the most forgettable and therefore ordinary pastry I’d ever eaten from a common bakery … and yet instead of immediately dismissing it from my mind, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of immense satisfaction mixed with my disappointment. 

A bizarre sensation.

Frankly, I didn’t understand it in the slightest. 

Something was clearly wrong. And it wasn’t my highly refined taste buds. I was a princess. I could name every poor quality ingredient used as well as which speck of dirt it’d been sourced from within 15 paces of accuracy.

However …  even I couldn’t discern what made my aversion swing wildly towards enjoyment.

Why, it was almost intangible. An ingredient I couldn’t note. Something beyond my palate. It was there and it wasn’t. A thing of utterly no substance, separated from the rest of the pastry.

And then–

I gasped, stepping back as half a chouquette fell to the floor.

“... H-How dare you!” I said, my hands covering my mouth.

“My dear?”

“You … You have used *magic* to enhance the flavour!”

All of a sudden, the auntie’s eyes widened.

She had no right to be stunned. That was entirely for me.

After all, what she’d done … was an unforgivable sin!

To cheat, no, to disgrace her entire profession with magic was the lowest of the low! Those caught were instantly exiled into culinary obscurity! It was a heinous crime, for it did away with all the sweat required to make up 95% of the taste!

“My dear,” said the con artist much too quickly. “I’m not quite sure what you just said. But I think you must be mistaken–”

“I most certainly am not!” I pointed to the … *thing* on the ground. “You cannot fool me! This … This is atrocious! The first and doubtless worst imitation of a chouquette I’ll ever suffer! No amount of false enjoyment can smother the lack of quality and expertise beneath!”

A feigned look of horror met me.

“I’m a baking professional! I’ve been doing this for more years than I can count!”

“Well, it seems you don’t count grams, either! But why should you when magic will make up the rest!”

“Perhaps … Perhaps there’s an issue with the ingredients? It’s been a difficult few days.”

“It’s been longer for your customers, apparently. Why, all this time, they’ve had no idea they’ve been waffling down baked magic! That cannot possibly be healthy!” 

A pause met me.

“There’s nothing unhealthy about magic. It’s perfectly natural.”

“So you admit you’re using magic?!”

“I admit these chouquettes are my best sellers–I’ve even won several awards for them!”

“Awards not overseen by me and are therefore invalid! This is *inexcusable*! Using magic to debase such a regal recipe is an act lower than what any bandit on a road could achieve … and neither me nor my loyal handmaiden will accept it!”

I waited for Coppelia’s huff of indignation.

“Omnomnomnomnomnomnomnom\~”

Instead, I turned in dismay to see a mound of fraudulent chouquettes vanishing into the void.

I pursed my lips … then returned to the equally stunned con artist.

“H-How dare you damage Coppelia’s taste buds! They’re already harmed beyond repair! That you would seek to do even more to them is unforgivable!” 

I waited for the apology.

However, far from immediately straining to grovel, the fraud briefly wrinkled her nose. The smile she’d worn returned as an impression even worse than her attempt at baking.

“My dear. I do believe you’re mistaken. As I said, I can no longer cast magic.”

“Well, then I suppose there’ll be no issue if I summon the nearest mage to investigate the possibility. I’m certain one can be found in the garrison somewhere. Rest assured, if I’m wrong, I shall offer full reparations.”

Thus, I immediately turned for the door.

*Pwam*.

It closed with a shudder, followed by the sound of a lock being turned. 

I looked behind me to see a sparkle of magic upon the finger of an auntie who could apparently no longer cast magic. 

Her eyes narrowed at me, just before she clicked her tongue.

“... All right, you brat,” she said, the far more natural tone of an irate cat owner replacing the kindly voice from before. “What do you think you’re doing?” 

I raised a hand to my lips, barely covering my smile.

“Ohhohohoho! Most wonderful! Indeed, let’s converse without the needless pantomime! Honesty is far better than classless deceit!” 

“Fine. What is it you want? … Crowns?”

“Yes. But not from you. You may rejoice. I’ve no wish to extort you. Only to see your scam revealed for all your customers to see.”

“This is my business. That would ruin it.”

“That’s impossible. You’ve already done that. And I’ve not a single idea why. Perhaps without the magic, your chouquettes would only be subpar in quality. There are worse ways to embarrass yourself. Such as this.”

The fraud suddenly snorted. The spark of magic upon her fingertip failed to fade.

“Subpar isn’t good enough,” she declared. “Do you have any inkling how competitive the world of baking is, girl? It’s more than sugar and spice. But blood enough to turn a street with far too many bakeries into a battlefield.”

I leaned in and smiled. The auntie leaned back.

“Ohohoho … do you think I don’t know that?”

“What?”

“I’m the one who presides over those battlefields. My ratings break careers. As you shall now learn.”.

“... Who are you, girl?”

A frown filled my eyes. I offered a pleasant smile. 

“Why, I’m the most impartial judge you’ll ever meet. And you’ve now scored a -1/10. My congratulations. This is an exceedingly rare score. Frankly, with such an overwhelming lack of talent, you should have remained a roadside conjurer or whatever you were before.”

A look of puzzlement flickered across the swindler’s face.

Then, her eyes glanced towards the copper ring disgracing my hand.

The reaction was immediate. She lowered her arms, then with a loud *clank*, she drew out a crooked staff from behind the counter. Taller than she was and grimmer than the wrinkles on her face, it boasted a gemstone of black opal swirling with living magic.

“What I was before was the same as now,” she said proudly. “Except with a few extra titles. I was Matron Hilda of the Barren Waste. It was I who seized the secrets of the earth from the spirit walkers. And it was I who brought the storm to them. You’re extremely foolish to call me out of retirement, *adventurer*.”

I raised an eyebrow.

“I hardly see why. Now you can cast your magic freely. Perhaps if you use every speck you possess, you can conjure an actual baker to do your job for you.”

The auntie’s nostrils flared.

A moment later, her staff burst into crackling black flames.

1iyglmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antigua/comments/1iyglmz/frequently_asked_questions_antigua_guatemala/,Frequently Asked Questions - Antigua Guatemala,"# What is Antigua Guatemala?

Antigua Guatemala, often called ""Antigua,"" is a historic city in Guatemala known for its beautiful colonial architecture, cobblestone streets, and rich culture. It was once the capital of Guatemala and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

# Where is it located?

Antigua is in the central highlands of Guatemala, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Guatemala City. It’s surrounded by three volcanoes: Agua, Fuego, and Acatenango.

# How do I get to Antigua?

Most people fly into La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City. From there, it’s a 45-minute to 1-hour drive to Antigua by car, shuttle, or taxi.

# What’s the best time to visit?

The weather is nice year-round, but the dry season (November to April) is the most popular time. March and April are busy because of Holy Week (Semana Santa) celebrations.

# What can I see and do in Antigua?

You can explore historic sites like the Santa Catalina Arch, La Merced Church, and the Antigua Cathedral. Other fun things include hiking volcanoes, visiting coffee farms, or shopping at local markets.

Check out the most popular [Tours and Activities](https://bit.ly/via-antigua-guatemala)

# Is it safe to visit?

Antigua is generally safe for tourists, especially in the main areas. Just use common sense—like avoiding empty streets at night and keeping an eye on your belongings.

# What’s the food like?

You’ll find traditional Guatemalan dishes like pepián (a spicy stew), tamales, and fresh tortillas. There are also international restaurants, cafes, and street food options.

# Do I need to speak Spanish?

Not really! Many people in Antigua speak some English, especially in tourist areas. But learning a few basic Spanish phrases can help.

# What should I pack?

Bring comfortable shoes for walking on cobblestone streets, light clothes for warm days, and a jacket for cooler nights. Sunscreen and a hat are good ideas too.

# How many days should I stay?

Two or three days is enough to see the main sights, but if you want to relax or take day trips (like to a volcano), plan for four or five days.

1iyglm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/1iyglm9/help_as_to_whenhow_i_should_ask_out_this_girl/,Help as to when/how I should ask out this girl?,"(Main question at bottom, please read context first)

So there’s this girl in my bio class (both of us hs seniors) and blah blah she’s quite pretty and I’m thinking about approaching her, she’s new at my school this semester—I’m 99.9% sure she’s not taken but I’m also fairly sure and suspect I’ve received some strong looks in my direction.

My plan was to approach her if I see her around campus and bring up that we have bio and stuff together and just tell her I think she’s cute and that I wanted to ask her for her number/snap—which I don’t feel is too much? Is there a different way I should do this?

I feel the need to say after something along the lines of like-if not, that’s totally fine and I don’t want to make things awkward for the rest of the semester (we don’t talk otherwise more like she doesn’t talk which I get bc she’s new and our school’s overwhelming as hell but the point is I don’t think either one of us can even be negatively affected) and I guess just suggest that I “need friends” and have nobody I really know in that class anyway—chat is this a good plan? (Plz don’t roast 😭)

I’m open to suggestions but I know this isn’t really “asking a girl out” which is why afterwards I was thinking of texting her after waiting a sec and stuff? Not too much but an appropriate amount where I can just say a few things and then maybe if I see her again at school have another more face-to-face conversation before I ask if ‘she’d want to hang out’ or ‘go get food or coffee’ sometime after school?

I don’t want to ask her out over text because to me that feels rushed, also I want her to be more familiar with me because we like don’t know each other.

My goal is to nail this first conversation with a friendly vibe so that she feels comfortable with me off the bat, and then I can go off it later?

A main question I have is that I’m leaving this  Thursday for a college visit and I’ll be gone the whole weekend, but that’s also the day I was for some reason planning on asking for her # (idrk why it just seems like the right day to bc we have bio that morning & our class schedule rotates all the time)
—But then the problem with that is that I won’t be at school on Friday or anything and I don’t wanna make her wait or get ancy if she is interested, or idk if I should like just do it on thurs anyway and then just text her a couple times over the weekend, and see her the following week? OR if I should wait until next week to do any of this at all. Any suggestions? Open to absolutely anything—the how or the when",1,1740548895.0,AdviceForTeens,1,1.0,False

I thought we always had chemistry, the intense stares, playful flirting, him blushing hard turning red whenever I complimented him. 
I cant describe everything here but Im a practical person and believe me when i say his eyes and actions said it all. Positioning himself at places where he doesn’t need to be to just stare at me while drinking his coffee, those kinda stuffs.

Now, it was morning, i did see him having coffee when i arrived. After like 2 minutes, i see him while going to get some coffee and i ask him that “hey im going to get coffee, you can join me if you hadn’t already had yours”. 

He didn’t even pause to think, he instinctively said “i already had mine.” It was so instinctive, like i dont think he even processed what i said. 

I was so hurt, I didn’t even wait for him to say anything else,i nonchalantly said “cool” and walked past him.

Now after that, i see him in my area more than usual, i catch him staring. On normal days, i would also look back, but that day, I decided i am done with him keeping me on the edge. I gave him a clear opportunity to hang out. It was his decision.

Now, idk, my delusions say he’s just shy or he doesn’t want people to see us hanging out?

Since bandra is posh area the rents are high i have to sell it at 300-350 rupees will cater to high end consumer like upper middle class. Why only 60 cups a day?

Faith likes to mess with the cats when they meow, especially Salem and Nebbie because they are in heat. Me and her were sitting on the couch watching tv my cat Momo was laying on the arm of the couch and Mel Mel was laying on the coffee table like she always does. We heard what sounded like Nebbie meowing in the kitchen so Faith starts to meow with her like she does as a joke to make her be quiet. We see that Nebbie is on a bookshelf between the kitchen and the living room and her mouth wasn't moving while we heard the meows. She said maybe its Salem and i looked and Salem is sitting in my gaming chair which is in the opposite side of the room, now she's freaked about that. Before all this crap with the hearing taps and stuff Faith and I heard what sounded like a big dog growl outside our window but my dog Chloe and her mate Teddy were in the pen with her sister Freckles so it wasn't them. We also heard what sounded like someone grunting in the hallway. Faith was in the bedroom laying down because she was tired and ready to go to sleep, while i was in the living room on the phone with my male best friend. She said she heard what sounded like tapping coming from the bathroom, but not just one or two, but multiple. She said it was like something was trying to get her attention or trying to get her to come in there. Just last night she heard the same taps but it was only two this time. She said both times she heard the tapping she refused to look, too scared she would see something through the crack of the sliding door in our bedroom that leads to the bathroom. I heard tapping coming from behind my husband computer. My best friend just heard tapping or a sound in the kitchen. Every time I turn around I keep thinking i see my oldest cat Salem in the dolly black chair and nothing is there when i turn. I even thought i saw my cat Nebbie coming towards me from the kitchen on the floor but she wasn't there either. So what is this? A demon or a mimic? Let me know. We keep hearing growling and I heard what sounded like a gurgling dog tummy but when i paused the video i didn't hear it again. Just saw what looked like Mel Mel trying to get up on the brown shelf but shes actually laying down in a chair in the kitchen. I even heard tapping behind the litterbox a few days ago.",0,1740547234.0,ParanormalEncounters,1,0.5,False
1iyg4yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1iyg4yb/sit_with_me_watch_the_sunrise/,Sit with me. Watch the sunrise,"I sat on a hill overlooking it all,



On a black beach towel among the green grass, looking down at the smoke-ridden skyline of the city, cut like cardboard against the cream-sickle sky.



For a second, I hated it all.



The distorted bass reverberating from passing cars windows

and the raised voices through paper thin drywall,



And,



The trash truck in my apartment complex that buzzed and whirred,

its claws grinding metallically as I sat by the window trying to focus,



And,



The person across the hall who got their rice and shrimp delivered at nine thirty every Wednesday night, the twenty dollar bill sticking out from under the doormat, wagging like a disembodied tail



And,



The ten thousandth face I saw on the metro, 

this morning, 

staring down, blurry face illuminated by a screen.



It was a long second. 



But as I sat there, on that hill overlooking it all.



My life.



Being born and dying in that building,

In the same room, 

In the same bed.

 

I ran my hand through the soft grass, pinching the blades between my fingers and feeling the cool earth against my palm.



Early morning sun reflected in the puddles after the heavy rain,

The cool dampness in the air around me.



The woman that smiled at me as she held the door at the coffee shop, 

this morning, 

her eyes full of joy. 



She had no trouble waiting, 

Her hands tucked into her jacket pockets,

Her posture upright.



I wanted to ask,

Whats your secret?



But I didn’t.



I smiled and thanked her,



Ordered my double expresso,



And stared down into a screen until I noticed she was gone.

I just keep getting progressively worse

This is NOT how I envisioned the start of 2025

There were so many things I had planned to do with my baby boy

This pain is just as much physical as it is emotional 

I have constant panic attacks and meltdowns

I’ve cried so much I’m extremely dehydrated 

I haven’t moved any of his belongings that are all over nor do I plan to unless I have to move unwillingly  

I miss his smell, his soft fur, his snoring, the pitter patter of his paws following me around everywhere ❤️

I miss his cuddles, the kisses, the sniffs, the talking (he talked in his own way) for treats ❤️

I miss the digging in his living room bed like a hundred times to circle and then plop down to then look at me and get up to join me on the couch ❤️

I miss how every morning he’d grab his Starbucks Puppuccino plushy to play with me and I would tell him that I understood he needed his morning coffee to start the day ❤️

I miss the way he knew I wasn’t okay with just looking into my eyes and would come to comfort me immediately ❤️

He has been with me through so much in life, and yet, even the bad times were not as bad because he was there ❤️ 

I’m irretrievably broken 💔 

The day my baby boy passed my heart and soul went away with him 💔 

The reason for my existence is gone 💔

The life has been sucked out of me and it will never return

I’m an empty shell of a human, I feel as if my body is decaying 

I don’t want help for this vicious never ending cycle 

I just want my soul dog back 💔🐾

I'm a regular reader of this subreddit, and for some reason, finance and money have always been on my mind 24/7 since I was young. I’m 20, living in Victoria, and currently in my second year of an electrical apprenticeship.

Right now, I have $13,000 saved in a HISA account with Ubank (5.5% interest p.a). I take home $681 per week after tax (excluding overtime), with only $150 going toward expenses (Left with $531/week after expenses and tax). I own my car outright, so that’s not a concern, and I live a very frugal lifestyle—I don’t party, drink, or spend much at all. I actually like being a cheapskate, and while I do plan to travel later in life, my main focus now is building a solid financial foundation.

I’d love some advice on what I can do with my savings and income. Should I invest? Keep saving? Look into property or other assets? I’m open to any financial strategies that align with my long-term goal of setting myself up as early as possible.

Imposter syndrome regarding finances.,"I don’t know if what I’m feeling is correct. I need some genuine help and guidance. 

I’ve been with my girlfriend for 3 years, since we’ve finished university. Both her and I come from very different lifestyles. My parents have been (and still are) living paycheck to paycheck. And her family (single mom and sister) do really well for themselves. 


For the past three years I’ve tried really hard to get the best job I can. And currently I’m making 95k which still doesn’t feel like enough. She on the other hand hasn’t really gotten a job since university and is living with her mom. 


I’ve always told her I want to be a provider male. That’s always how I saw my dad. He tried his best and to this day makes ends meet for my family. 
She’s always appreciated that aspect and for 3 years now anytime we’re going out I’m paying for everything. Wether it’s fancy restaurants or everyday coffee/activities. I’ve spent thousands  on birthdays and Valentine’s Day etc. 

I’m realizing that anytime I go out I need to budget and mentally prepare for paying for everything. 


Recently we had a conversation and she told me she has around 15-20 k in savings. I don’t know how she has that much saved since she doesn’t really work. But I reflected and realized I’m living almost paycheck to paycheck. 

Sje also told me she’s going on a vacation with her mom and sister and spending almost 10k for just the trip plus a few more thousands in shopping. I myself have never been on a vacation let alone spent thousands on shopping. 

I’m feeling imposter syndrome and I feel like I’m not good enough to be here. I don’t feel like spending my money on her the way I used to. Idk if this is bad or good",4,1740545830.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

During the first short break, I started to notice some of his tendencies based on his past and what he was doing with me.  I encouraged him to go to therapy.  A few months later, during the second break, he finally agreed to go.  But I don't think he did any self-reflection and only focused on how he felt in our current relationship.  Things got a bit better, to the point that we were regularly talking about a future together, making plans, him moving in, thinking I would be engaged by the end of the year.  I was his longest relationship ever.

Instead, the night I got back from a work trip when I wanted to talk about how his therapy was going, he said, ""I don't feel committed to this relationship anymore.""  To say I was blindsided would be an understatement.  During the entire breakup conversation, he kept saying how he didn't want to lose having me in his life, and he could still see a future with me in it 🙄.

After two weeks, we saw each other because I was still hopelessly in love with him, but I did call him out on being a dismissive-avoidant.  He said he wanted to keep hanging out and that he would begin to take therapy seriously.  I said that was fine, but I was going to go on dates with other people.  We hung out about every other for three months.  He said he was still working through things and I believed him.

Then, my friend ends up at the same speed dating event as him.  He acts like they are good friends and talks about all the dating he has been doing.  I call him out for breadcrumbing and tell him its over.  A few days later, he texts saying his heart hurts and he is so conflicted, do I want to grab a coffee?  I say fine.  The day we are supposed to go, he texts saying he can't do this in person because every time he sees me in person he gets a glimmer of hope and he can't stand the pain of losing me forever, but that in order to move on from this relationship we need to never see each other again.  He says we can still meet to say goodbye.

I went to his house, and the entire time, he kept saying how hard this was. He doesn't want to lose me, but he also wants to date other women, and that's not fair.  I finally said I needed to leave (bc my heart was breaking all over again).  I dumbly called him later, begging him just to take a month to truly be single and actually go to therapy.  He said he would at least text me in a month.  Its been one week since that conversation.

I can see clearly who he is, his avoidant attachment, and his bullshit.  But there is a part of me that so strongly still wants him back and that if he just put in the work, he could change.  How do I get over this???  I feel like an absolute idiot for wanting to beg him to take me back.",3,1740545375.0,AvoidantBreakUps,2,0.81,False

From the start, our conversations felt different—he actually wanted to get to know me, and I really enjoyed talking to him.

After about a week of chatting, we exchanged phone numbers, and he even wished me a happy Valentine’s Day, which I thought was really sweet. Since then, we’ve been talking every day, and I finally built up the confidence to ask him if he wanted to grab coffee sometime. He said, “Sure, I’d love to,” which made me really happy. But since Saturday evening, he hasn’t texted me back at all.

I know he has an important job with long hours, so I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I can’t help but overthink. Did I misread his interest? Is he just busy? Should I reach out again, or just wait and see if he replies?

I thought things were going really well, and I think he’s such a sweet guy, so this sudden silence is making me anxious.

I don’t know if the site is down permanently :(. Glad I got the duets before they closed.

Preface: I prefer “quieter” scents and am particularly attracted to wood notes. All reviews are on skin. 

**Cabin**

*herbaceous lavender, fresh rain, a cup of black coffee with a splash of vanilla extract, towering white cedar trees, red pine bark, and spindly black spruce needles.*

Keywords: coffee, medicine

I heard great things about this scent but it’s very different from my expectation. It’s bitter black coffee forward, with some fresh medicinal scents in the background. But the coffee note very quickly fades in to this extremely medicinal and bitter scent mixed with a bit of sweetness that is just a hint too realistic for me. It reminds me of actual cough medicine I have had to take, but I can see the scent growing on me as time pass. I’m still a little ambivalent towards it right now. 3/5.




**Blackwater Lake**

*Short-needle pine branches hang over mossy lake rocks, radiant white water lilies soak in the sun, the surface of the dark lake water ripples above submerged northern watermilfoil, and a chill in the air warns of impending autumn.*

Keywords: aquatic, citrus, really light florals

This is a weird one. I got aquatic and dusty (?) pine at first, but it quickly transformed into an entirely citrusy scent and stayed that way. Extremely light aquatic kinda stayed throughout but the citrus was just overwhelming. 2/5




**I and Thou**

*Fluttering birch tree leaves, forest green grass, and pine needles provide the greenness of the forest, while pine, iso e super, cedar, and sandalwood depict the weathered wood, and clary sage, clearwood, and vetiver ground the tree roots.*

Keywords: ambiguous green notes and wood.

This is pretty and calming. It’s not a fresh green scent which I really appreciate, I would even describe it as warm. Extremely wearable but not particularly memorable if I were to be nitpicky. 5/5.




**Solario**

*The first warm day after a long winter—when the sun sinks into your skin, down to your bones, and warms you from the inside out.*

Keywords: cedar, vanilla, warmth :)

This is Possets Silver Cedar with less cedar and more musk and vanilla sandalwood. It’s so warm and subtlety elegant. A lazy Sunday afternoon with warm sunlight filtering through white laced curtains. I need this so much pleeease. 5/5. 




**Stratus**

*Stratus clouds drifting above a misty forest: trodden stems in damp soil, silvery osmanthus petals, stones slick with moisture, a lingering trail of deer musk, and never-ending fog.*

Keywords: newly grown stems, heavy petrichor, dirt, osmanthus. 
 
This really hits you in the face with the petrichor and the green wetness. There’s also a coolness to it which puts together so well an image of a rainy day in the forest. Again I think Osmofolia excels at “fresh but not sharp”, which I’m beginning to really love from them. 5/5


**The Philosopher’s Garden**

*A verdant, peaceful garden, lovingly tended and rich with life: dewy lily of the valley, sweet and herbal lavenders, English cucumbers, clusters of dainty sweet peas, winding vines of ivy, damp oakmoss, and freshest white musk.*

Keywords: sweet, greens, cucumbers

For some reason the cucumber really stands out on my skin besides the sweetness. I don’t hate this but I can’t put into words which particular part I’m not loving. I guess the extremely sweet counterpart to the herbal and greener notes throws me off. Maybe I don’t like sweet peas? I never really smelled it before. 3/5.

Details on most locations can be found in the Rick Steves Iceland guidebook or this subreddit, though I have included some links. Feel free to ask me anything - I go into more detail in some areas than in others.

**General Itinerary**

February 12-20, 2025

Traveling from East Coast of USA

*5 nights in Hella:*

* Day 1: Arrived early, breakfast near airport, Selfoss for groceries and lunch, sightseeing along the way to hotel
* Day 2: Self drive South Coast tour (Hella to Vik and back)
* Day 3: Self drive Golden Circle tour
* Day 4: Other sightseeing and shopping 
* Day 5: Katla ice cave tour

*2 nights in Reykjavik:*

* Day 1: Lava Show, sunset visit to Sky Lagoon, late night hot dog
* Day 2: Perlan, shopping, Settlement Exhibition, dinner out
* Day 3: Morning visit to Blue Lagoon, quick lunch, late afternoon flight

**Note on Accessibility**

I traveled with my 88 year old grandmother, whose sole purpose was to see the northern lights. She’d booked five nights at Hotel Ranga in Hella, on the South Coast. I tagged along and added two nights in Reykjavik to see more of the country and have a backup plan for bad weather. Because I joined her, we opted to rent a car to make things a bit more flexible. 

She moves a bit slower, has balance issues, and uses a cane… and our trip COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER for accessibility! I won’t make a sweeping statement since I don’t have accessibility needs myself but I will say that most restaurants and sites had incredible accommodations for those needing extra assistance getting around. From the Perlan ice cave to the LAVA Centre observation deck, from small restaurants with handicapped restrooms to hotels and museums pointing us toward elevators and offering wheelchairs for our use, we were totally comfortable and presented with great options. Even the Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon are prepared with large accessible changing areas/restrooms, pool noodles, and more. Our one “hitch” was that my grandmother doesn’t have balance in water, so even a pool noodle couldn’t help her, but friendly fellow visitors and patient lifeguards made our experience exceptional.

Just note, if you have similar needs, I would highly recommend bringing or borrowing a wheelchair to access more of the Golden Circle sites than we were able to. My grandmother simply wanted to only walk a little bit, rather than use a wheelchair that we could have borrowed if she wanted. It had to do with her energy, the high winds, and the uneven ground in places. I respected her wishes, and she happily camped out at the onsite cafes and used the available sidewalks/walkways to observe what she could.

**Playlist**

Forgive me if this is silly to share, but I exclusively listened to this playlist while planning the trip and during our day trip drives. So now, the songs bring me right back to Iceland!

*Iceland Road Trip:* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3zUdO8wvOYhcvgec4R3BQ4](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3zUdO8wvOYhcvgec4R3BQ4)

**Attire & Supplies**

I am an over-packer and spent months preparing, using this subreddit as guidance, and was able to collect supplies from about October through February via Costco, Amazon, and Sierra outdoor store. Now that I’ve returned, I feel what I brought was just right for me. Have I conquered over-packing?! Probably not, but given I was responsible for my luggage and my grandmother’s, I came through on traveling lighter for this trip (with a full size suitcase and one carry-on, of course… I’m not a wizard!).

*Clothing:*

* Eddie Bauer Women’s Sun Valley Down Parka (mid-thigh length, waterproof and windproof) - bought in-store from Costco
* Columbia Ladies' Arden Point Lined Pant (waterproof and windproof) - bought online from Costco (I wore these every day)
* Eddie Bauer Women's 2.0 Polar Fleece-Lined Pull-On Pants (waterproof and windproof) - bought in-store from Costco (I didn’t wear these)
* Various wool blend sweaters I already owned - these were hardy enough to wear on adventures but nice enough to wear for dinner. I was planning to buy an Icelandic wool sweater as a souvenir and for warmth if needed, but I opted not to. I just can’t do 100% wool - too itchy for me. Plus, we had warmer weather.
* Kirkland Merino Wool socks (brought and used 8 pair) - bought in-store from Costco
* 32 Degree Heat thermal shirts and pants (wore about 4 shirts and 2 pants the whole trip as layers under what’s mentioned above) - bought in-store from Costco
* Sorel Kinetic Impact Conquest Women’s Waterproof Boot - bought from Amazon (great insulated sneaker/boot hybrid that provided enough warmth with my merino wool socks)
* Columbia lightweight waterproof pants to layer over other pants (I wore these at Seljalandsfoss and would have worn them in rain to ensure my socks stayed dry)
* I brought dressier shirts and pants for dinner, and didn’t use anything except black legging weight pants for dinner at our hotel one evening, which is also when I wore the pair of dressy black ankle boots that I wore once. In retrospect, I should have only brought my Sorel boots since they are somewhat fashionable and plenty appropriate for restaurants in Iceland.
* One swimsuit and flip flops (needed the sandals for our hotel hot tub but not the lagoons)
* Packable down vest from Uniqlo - already owned, wore on the plane and for my ice cave excursion
* Comfy travel set to wear on plane and in the hotel

*Selected Supplies*

* Snowtrax by Yaktrax - bought in-store from Costco for less than $10 each pair
* Waterproof boot covers for my grandmother who didn’t have waterproof boots - from Amazon [https://a.co/d/e1XRo7C](https://a.co/d/e1XRo7C)
* Hand and foot warmers
* Disposable ponchos
* Collapsible lightweight walking sticks - already owned, wouldn’t have brought otherwise, didn’t use but might have in the snow since we had accessibility needs 
* Waterproof and windproof gloves from Costco
* Wool hat that I bought in Iceland - NOTE that you can find hats that are lined with cotton and don’t have to suffer like me (the itching drove me crazy but I am still happy I got that hat!)
* Fleece headband for milder weather (and ended up wearing under the itchy hat) 
* Fleece balaclava - I’d recommend this or a scarf. Wore only on ice cave trip. Wouldn’t travel to Iceland without it!

**Apps**

* Safety: Vegagerðin & Veður (downloaded but didn’t use SafeTravel app)
* Navigation: Google Maps
* Parking: Parka & EasyPark
* Trip management: Icelandair & Google Sheets shortcut to my itinerary 
* Northern lights: Aurora app
* Touring: GetYourGuide (used for reference only while booking experiences independently)
* Iceland eSim purchase: Airalo

**Weather!**

We visited February 12-20, 2025, on the heels of a major storm that melted most of the snow in the areas we visited. Therefore, the driving conditions were ideal - great visibility and no ice. Aside for light snow in Vik (which was still worthy of much caution while driving, due to limited visibility and slippery roads) and some rain in Reykjavik, we had mostly sunny days in the 30s and 40s. Wind was still a factor, especially when driving (anywhere) and going out on foot (intense along the South Coast). I was really happy with the attire and supplies we brought; it didn’t seem like overkill at all, even with our unusually good weather. Our first four nights in Hella, we had clear skies and saw the northern lights.

**Accommodations**

* 5 nights at Hotel Ranga: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/JfNkC6hQQdaCJ5qg7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JfNkC6hQQdaCJ5qg7)

**Rental Car & Parking**

* Lotus Car Rental Iceland: https://maps.app.goo.gl/TYGMVG5rnq4HzAgd8
   * Per the advice of this subreddit, I chose Platinum insurance with my automatic 4x4 rental. This came with a Wifi hotspot that I used for the entirely of our trip, almost negating the need for my eSim, but I was glad to have both options.
   * At KEF, wait at the “Meeting Point” for the Lotus shuttle driver, near the departure hall. DO NOT go out to the shuttle stop in the parking lot.
   * Visit Kökulist bakery on your way to and from the airport/car rental: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/JZpzznQvPkoguicX7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JZpzznQvPkoguicX7)
* I used apps or kiosks to pay for parking. Cameras are relatively hidden so it may be easy to forget that you need to pay after arrival; note if you forget you only have 24 hours to pay via the app before you are ticketed.

**Experiences**

*Not an exhaustive list of what we did, but what I want to mention.*

* **South Coast**
   * Katlatrack [https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hw8guxHgzPV8RgK78](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hw8guxHgzPV8RgK78)

      * I booked directly with Katlatrack and could not recommend this tour enough! Yes, it is a natural ice cave, if you are wondering. Different every year… they change over the course of weeks and months. 
      * Shout out to Davis, our awesome tour guide!
      * If you’re following along, my grandmother obviously opted out of this one.

   * A popular spot for higher end souvenirs: Rammagerðin (multiple locations)
   * Locally designed crafts for home, jewelry, etc.: Kirsuberjatréð [https://maps.app.goo.gl/uj3T7ibb4UFE7HU79](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uj3T7ibb4UFE7HU79)

* **Reykjavik**
   * Tapas Barinn [https://maps.app.goo.gl/fSadHshW1QCDYfBZ6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fSadHshW1QCDYfBZ6) (opted to dine here for a selection of Icelandic food to share tapas style, rather than a walking food tour)

      * The Soup Company [https://maps.app.goo.gl/bfsJGLSsYPpbAy6E7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bfsJGLSsYPpbAy6E7) (free 2nd bowl of soup, shares building with the Lava Show)
   * Hella

* **Golden Circle**
   * Vínstofa Friðheima - Winebar & Bistro [https://maps.app.goo.gl/DT6vcg6jEnFzwjgX7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DT6vcg6jEnFzwjgX7)
      * This is the wine bar associated with Friðheimar, the tomato farm with the famous greenhouse restaurant. The beautifully decorated wine bar is open for more hours than the greenhouse restaurant and offers much the same dishes (the signature tomato soup and ridiculously good bread) plus an expanded menu. We dined here and not at the full restaurant and LOVED it. We still peeked into the greenhouses after dining. I recommend the wine bar hands down.

After about a week of chatting, we exchanged phone numbers, and he even wished me a happy Valentine’s Day, which I thought was really sweet. Since then, we’ve been talking every day, and I finally built up the confidence to ask him if he wanted to grab coffee sometime. He said, “Sure, I’d love to,” which made me really happy. But since Saturday evening, he hasn’t texted me back at all.

I know he has an important job with long hours, so I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I can’t help but overthink. Did I misread his interest? Is he just busy? Should I reach out again, or just wait and see if he replies?

I thought things were going really well, and I think he’s such a sweet guy, so this sudden silence is making me anxious. Am I overthinking, or does this seem like a red flag? What should I do?",2,1740544542.0,GrindrStories,0,1.0,False

1iyfbuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1iyfbuz/week_1_experience_with_wegovy/,Week 1 experience with Wegovy,"SW:288 6'5"" Male

Decided to talk to my PCP about getting some help with weight loss. My cravings had been out of control and so I started researching my options. I'm not diabetic, so i saw my best options as Wegovy or Zepbound.

I decided on Wegovy bc its been around longer and has more research to support claims of improved cardiovascular, cholesterol, and benefit toward lowering a stroke/cardiac event.  I also liked that Wegovy is the 3rd generation in GLP-1's.

Had a great convo with PCP and she agreed Wegovy was a perfect fit for my goals.

It took 2 days to get the authorization from insurance provider, and I had a 1 month supply of 0.25mg a day later. I think I saw the doctor on Tuesday and had my injectors on Friday.

I decided to do my first shot on Saturday and celebrated with a homemade pasta dinner, garlic bread, the works.

**Day 1:** Woke up Saturday, weighed in at 288.

I was nervous about the shot. Would it hurt? Would I miss?

It was easy. Instructions are on the Wegovy website.

Swabbed injection site with rubbing alcohol. Popped off the cap, and pressed it into my gut \~4"" from belly button.

I felt nothing, just pressure from pushing the injector onto my gut.

Within an hour, I felt different. Less hungry. Maybe it was the Wegovy, maybe it was just knowing I'm starting this weight loss journey and feeling like this time will be different.

Later that day, I had a bowl of past leftover from the night before and a piece of garlic bread.

It wasn't much, but I felt FULL. Like I had just had a big meal.

No other side-affects, maybe a little queasiness, but nothing major.

**Day 2:** Weighed in at 286 and feeling INSPIRED.

I had a light breakfast and put some pork ribs on the smoker for dinner Sun/Mon/Tues (salt & pepper rub, no sugar)

First big test: Going out to eat with family to celebrate a birthday.

I had zero desire to partake in any alcohol drinks, I ordered water.

While everyone was ordering cheeseburgers and chicken tenders. I treated myself to a Ceasar Salad (which kinda sucked tbh)

When it came time for cake, i passed.

Came home, had a couple pork ribs for dinner. Went to bed.

**Day 3:** Weighed in at 282!!

FELT INSPIRED and decided to do some dumbell exercises in the basement.

Fell into old dietary habits -> Only coffee in the morning while I do some lifting. Post-workout I made a green shake with Kale, Broccoli florets, frozen strawberries, almond milk, heaping scoop of protein powder and scoop of collagen peptides.

I drank that, felt full. Again, like I had just eaten a big meal FULL.

Got to work later and where I'd normally have 2 keto-nut bars... I only had one, bc I felt full. About halfway through the bar I thought ""why am i even eating this lol""

Came home, ate dinner (pork ribs lolol) smoked a bowl, went to bed.

I'm still having zero side-effects at this point. Perhaps a bit gassy (my green shakes do that anyway), but otherwise nothing.

**Day 4 (today):** Weighed in at 279!

Pounds are just melting off. Probably water weight? Idk, my bathroom scale measures BMI, Fat% and calculates muscle%

Body fat decreasing, muscle % increasing. Things looking good.

I do feel like the shot is beginning to wear off a little, but I did some research and followed the suggestion to keep hydrating and eating.

Sure enough if I drink a big glass of water... I FEEL FULL, or at least less hangry.

I was still hungry, made some eggs and sausage, felt full aftward.

I thought to myself: this is what skinny people must feel like every day.

After breakfast I worked out lightly, did some squats and other lower back / leg exercises.

Afterward I made another green shake--2 scoops of protein.

I'm sure the weight loss will slow down, but I'm feeling great about my progress and feeling great about my ability to maintain a healthy lifestyle now that my cravings are under control.

My plan is to continue to lift, exercise, and eat protein with every meal to avoid losing muscle mass--besides muscles burn fat!!

I also grabbed some chewable electrolyte tablets and pop one every 4-5hrs. 

Anyway, just sharing my experience in the hope it will inform or assist anyone thinking about Wegovy/Zep.

My best advice is to ease into the healthy lifestyle. Give yourself one last splurge before the shot. Once you take the shot, your cravings will go away. Food just isn't that important anymore.

Once that happens, you need a plan to eat healthier, hydrate, and exercise. GOOD LUCK",2,1740544416.0,WegovyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iyf9c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1iyf9c5/to_j_from_h/,To J from H,"Dear J.

This letter hurts to write. But, it should. These words have been long overdue. Not for you, but for me.

It's been a year (02.23.24) since I last saw you. 

To say I miss you isn't enough to capture my longing for you. I have had panic attacks, anxiety spells, and breakdowns, all in the name of you. The heart you left broken was the reason I ended up in therapy. The cause for my psychiatric medications to start. 

I nearly killed myself. My depression and every other condition I got diagnosed with took over me. My psychosomatic symptoms from your absence led my doctors to discover I had a chronic illness and an autoimmune disease. You brought so much death with you. And I was okay in ceasing to exist.

Our love was one-sided. I was in love with you. And perhaps I still am. 

You? I still don't know what I was to you.

A year ago today, I told you I liked you. You told me, ""we should definitely get to know each other."" I should have understood then.

There we were - two mental health technicians, first locking eyes on January 23rd, 2024. You didn't know me. But I knew you. 

I saw you every now and then at the psych hospital we worked at. You were heroic, coming in at the right time whenever we had behavior codes. Walking with a posture that exuded leadership and confidence. But you were kind with your words. Gentle. Personable. 

Your hair was long then. Nearly reaching the ends of your ears. Waves carefully touching your skin. We were on covid protocol then. So the mask, well, masked your delicate features. But your eyes made up for it. They always had a glimmer. Light brown and shining. 

I always thought green was my favorite color. But that day when we locked eyes - suddenly the whole world was brown. Shining. Shimmering. Splendor. 

And since then, brown was all I could see.

I felt close to you when we first worked together. You were training an orientee. And the way you guided her through the works and responsibilities, I had a closer look into your character. 

You were dependable, patient, and comforting. Perhaps that's what drew me to you. I felt safe. You made me feel safe. My entire life was danger, and you brought in protection. Why would I want life any other way?

My head was conquered by thoughts of you. I was utterly broken, and I deemed you as the fix that would put me back together.

So, you can only imagine my reverie when I overhead you telling our supervisor that you were leaving a couple of days later. February 20th was your last day. I remember going numb. I remember running to the restroom. I remember bawling my eyes out. And I remember pulling myself together because our shift was about to start. 

That day, I ended up pulling 16 hours at work. Staying overnight in the quiet as the patients were asleep gave me enough of a distraction. But that entire night I spent crying. I was appalled that my body had enough energy to produce all those tears. I knew I couldn't  - and wouldn't - sleep.

With some much-needed encouragement, my friend pushed me to pursue you. I know being a girl and making the first move is stigmatized. But I had been independent my whole life. I shouldered everything on my own because every man in my life - father, brothers, friends, cousins, uncles, bosses, teachers - had failed me. I never tasted masculine dependence. With you, I was willing to try.

The next day I saw you again. I asked you if it was okay to get your number after work. You smirked and flirtatiously remarked, ""Why not just take it now?"" My stomach sinks as I think of it. 

In the coming days, I worked with you once again. That shift was probably my favorite. You would come and stand close to me. Every now and then, your shoulder brushed against mine. You humored me, and I humored you back. We indulged in playful banter. Flirtatious retorts were thrown here and there. Shoulders brushing. Whispered giggles. Longing looks. You even asked when I'd quit working at the hospital to come work with you at the radiology clinic. Not so discreet, were you? 

We shared information about various topics. You and I had the same dreams. We wanted to get our Psy.D. in psychology in the coming years. Our upbringings were difficult. You were as close to your dad as I was to my mom. We were the oldest kids and lived a life that reminded us of that every second.

You couldn't stomach horror movies. I devoured them. We abused caffeine. We laughed over our dislike for capitalism. 

Your favorite album was September 5th. My birthday. I was dizzy. This was meant to be, right? 

Later, I asked you what you would do with your signature mental health technician stamp. You said, ""I don't know, do you want it?"" You asked so shyly. I caught how your cheeks were tinted pink. Stunned, I replied, ""What would I do with it?"" But I knew. I wanted that stamp more than anything. My life would be complete if I got it. We promised that you'd give it to me on your last day of work. That stamp would come to symbolize that you existed. And I existed the same time as you.

Whatever moments we shared, lingered.

I didn't text you until February 14th. Valentine's Day - the day of love. I had planned it. These intricate details showcased how important you were to me. And I made sure to text you exactly at 3.14 - your birthday time. 

The conversations started civil at first. Two days later, you asked me if I drank. I said no. Religious reasons. It was taboo enough that a Muslim girl from Pakistan had fallen for a white, westernised boy with Hungarian roots. Indulging in alcohol with you was more than what I was prepared for.

Little did I know that it was an indirect way of asking me out. How I regretted saying no. I would've drank water or soda all night if it meant being with you. That's all I wanted with you. Time.

We planned to meet the following Sunday for breakfast. It didn't work out. Previous commitments came in the way. And that's how it kept happening. Commitments kept coming in the way, and that date never happened. 

Our conversations went well sometimes. Other times, I found myself pacing in my room night after night, wondering why you hadn't responded. There were the logical explanations, of course - you were strict with your schedule. Early sleeper early riser. Exercising. Sports. Reading. Time with family. Nothing was supposed to stray from your routine. Me? I played life by ear. I didn't believe in routines. 

The discrepancy in our communication made me question if I was as much of a priority for you as you were for me. Did your heart skip a beat when notifications from me popped up on your phone? Because my heart raced every time you showed up on my screen. And sank every time you didn't. 

You hosted a going away party on the 23rd. In anticipation of it arriving, I began to prepare a gift package for you. What can I say - gift-giving is a love language of mine.

I got you a hoodie with an imprint of the left and right brain. (I may have sprayed my signature perfume on it so you were affiliated with my scent. Was it creepy? Maybe. Maybe not.) 

I wrote you a card wishing you well on your journey ahead and how I'd always cherish our time together. I got you two books - The Body Keeps the Score, a Psychological Classic, and Demien, a bildungsroman recommended by my favorite artist, Kim Namjoon. Some paraphernalia were of our inside jokes.

And then there was the gift of us. A stamp. From me. That stamp would come to symbolize that I existed. And you existed the same time as me.

When the day came, I felt alienated at the bar. People blended in so smoothly with the drinks, the music, and the vibrant ambiance.

And then there was me, betraying my religion, donning the hijab, having a bar stamp on my hand. I was in the house of something that Allah had forbidden. A hypocrite doing all this for a man she wasn't even sure she would end up with. 

When I entered the bar, I couldn't find you at first. Traveling deeper, I spotted your head in the midst of the crowd. You were always taller than the rest. And since you had recently shaven off your head, that baldness nearly blinded me under the party lights.

It was as if you felt my arrival. The second my eyes landed on you, it was like you heard the wheels hit the runway. And like an eager relative waiting at the airport, you came sprinting. Your eyes stayed glued on me as I walked over to you. Like if you took them off, I'd disappear. We exhanged awkward greetings, and you pulled me in for a hug. It was warm, it was quick, but it felt like I arrived at a place that belonged. Like a home that never existed, it suddenly materialised itself in my presence. 

The night went on. You mingled. I mildly mingled. And as the night went on, i noticed the stolen glances we shared, stagnant for a moment but swift to turn away lest somebody witnessed this secret language we blended in. 

After all, you taught me a secret language, and I couldn't speak it with anyone else.

It was time to go. You had wanted me to stay longer. I had snuck out of a brown household. I was playing with fire, and it began getting increasingly warm. 

I walked with you to my car. There, I pulled out the gift bags. One for the tender arrival of your birthday in 3 weeks and the other as your departure as my coworker. You were speechless. Or just weirded out. Who goes to this extent when they've only known you for a month? 

I do. Like you would come to say in a future conversation, I had some personality.'

Then we walked to your car. You handed me your stamp. Our skin collided for a brief moment. We talked. Standing in the february breeze. Your friends were all gathered smoking at the bar entrance. I still love how you didn't smoke with that crowd. 

But, despite your friends wanting you over, you stayed with me. You had your hands in your pocket, looking down at the gravel underneath, shoulders hunched. Were you shy? Did you not know how to respond? I guess I'll never know. 

You kept bringing up how you wished I'd stay. I came to learn later that the party would travel to your house. And perhaps you wanted me there. 

Before departing, you announced you were going to hug me. Soon after I was enveloped by you, my head fitting perfectly against your chest, your back firm as my arms rolled around it. 

That's when I caught your scent. No, you didn't have to bathe yourself in perfume for me to smell you. Your scent was just ... you. That's the best way I can describe it. Sometimes, I still feel like I never moved on from that hug. I'm still in it. I'm right where you left me. 

And so we said our goodbyes. The hug was broken. The hands waved. The last look over the shoulder before we disappeared from each other's line of sight.

And then I never saw you again.

The conversations picked up. I had confessed my feelings. You somewhat reciprocated. But, you were sure you wanted this to continue. Sometimes, we texted on end. Others, I wouldn't hear from you for days. I was always the one initiating the texts. I was losing you. To what? Or to who? Nothing felt the same. 

On March 31st, at 5:27 p.m., I mustered up the courage to call you. It lasted 14 minutes and 32 seconds. The first thing you said when you picked up was, ""Well, I haven't heard your voice in a long time."" I hadn't either, J. I hadn't either. 

The rest of the calls were all initiated by me. You grew further. The spark dimmed. It was ridiculous. I was ridiculous. The only time you called me was when my friend told you I rushed to the ER for a false heart attack (which was obviously just a very violent panic attack). I remember being in the hospital, just wishing you could barge in through the doors, racing to me, sweat beading your forehead, a worried expression on your face, hands reaching for mine, bodies colliding for a hug. But, like several moments in life before, I didn't get what I desperately wanted. This was life as I knew it.

Over time, I kept pestering you for when we would meet. You never seemed to show interest. And I was foolishly latching onto the false hope of it.

When I told my friends about you, they were delighted. They stalked your social media, approved of your features, and excitedly asked me when I could meet you. I was too embarrassed to admit that they couldn't, for I hadn't. 

The next few days blurred together, but we finally decided to meet for coffee on April 7th. I was ecstatic. My mind was on a high I felt I would never come down from. My friends prepped me. I did research on what we'd talk about. The night before, we engaged in playful yet flirtatious banter. This was finally happening.

So, tell me why you never showed up? 

Tell me why you never picked up as I anxiously dialed call after call?

Tell me why I left that restaurant with the ghost of us?

Tell me why all I got from you was a text saying sorry, but you were too hungover because you went out drinking with your high school friends the night before? 

And tell me why I was stupid enough to put up with your shit after? Why did I forgive you and instead feel apologetic for disturbing you?

Tell me why. 

The week after, on April 15th, it all ended. The days in between were one's of sleep lost. Nights full of pacing and tears. Of fastened heartbeats. Of dead hunger. Of shaking limbs. I had to call off for three days straight from the time you never showed. I had stomached all these feelings so there was no place for food. I was numb, almost catatonic. Staring at the ceiling, begging for some answers. Overthinking for the life of me. My depression, my anxiety, my insomnia, my trauma. Nothing swayed despite me abusing my medications.

The following Sunday, I called you. It went to voicemail. I hung up. 

The next morning morning, I arose with a text from you saying, ""Hey, just noticed you called. Everything okay?"" 

I never replied to that text. I never talked to you after. Because something snapped within me, prodding me to let this go. There was too much happening at the time, and carrying this would surely have resulted in me killing myself. 

It made me want to die.

And so the following days were brimming with bulimic episodes, sunken eyes, migraines, nausea, body spasms, back pains, and blurry vision. Every psychosomatic symptom one can think of.

And in all this misery, I fantasized about you calling and checking in on me, anything. Just you.

I existed as this disease at work, home, my appointments, in the car, everywhere. My friend noticed and in a few weeks asked me if I'd like her to reach out to you. I brushed it off as she could do whatever she wanted. Ultimately, she did. On Mother's Day, May 12th, she sent you a long paragraph about how well we went together. It was just meant to be. She was 51, so the semantics were romantic with the expectations of a movie-like love. 

And your reply?

""I'm not interested right now.""

What the fuck did that mean? You weren't interested right now so were you going come back fucking later? Asshole.

My world shattered. I went numb. 

It was over.

And just like, the biggest moment of my life was ruined by the smallest man who ever lived. 

You. J.

To my friends, I shrugged it off. People had asked me to forgive you when you stood me up. But, this time, I didn't care. 

I was too tired. Tired to pursue you. Tired to think. And unfortunately, too tired to take my own life. 

Everything inside me switched off. The woman who was sitting at that restaurant, exhilarated, grateful for new beginnings was now a little girl. Her childhood stuck in the walls of that restaurant, within the coffee aroma, surrounded by couples and friends and students and business partners just living. 

Yearning. Waiting. Hoping.

I didn't kill myself but I died that day.

The concept of you ceasing to exist with that little girl.

And she still sits there. Little H. The restaurant going up in flames. Her trying to get out. Me trying to safe. 

I can't protect her. She can't get out.

She's right there where you left her. 

I'm stuck there, J. 

You became one of them. 

You were just a man.

Like my father who abused. Like my brother who disrespected. Like my uncles who bullied. Like my friends who lied. Like my cousins who judged. Like my bosses who considered me inferior because I am a woman. 

Like you. Who left.

Whether the signs were there or not, you didn't have the balls to say in my face that you didn't want to do this anymore. You cut corners. Took shortcuts. Hide behind walls. But you couldn't face your own cowardice.

Did you even like me? Did I just boost your ego? Did I lick that attention-depraved heart of yours? Did you love this power dynamic? Or did you ravish yourself in all of this.

I can't blame you. The signs were there. They were always there.

The inconsistencies with texting. Standing me up. Ignoring my phone calls.

I was the depraved one. I was the little girl who was abused, traumatized, and neglected. I was a little girl trying to find a fragment of love.

I was a little girl stuck inside a 25 year old woman's body. 

I should have known better.

It took forever to forget you. The little semblances of you I saw next were smoking sessions, drunken parties, sports updates on your social media.

You told me you got cheated on by a girlfriend before. I'll always wonder if that came in the way.

To add salt to my open wounds, I had a falling out with the friend who reached to you. In a conversation of immense manipulation, she confessed that you had been running your mouth about me. People at the hospital knew. And the details were villianised fabrications of me. 

So you proceeded with malice while i had to stay with your reminders. Ultimately, it became so overbearing. You wrecked the halls that I once walked through. Your ghost existed in every crevice and cranny of that hospital.

And so like you left me, I left it. 

And everything in it. 

I never looked back. Never spoke to those coworkers again. Never reached out to you again. Never to love again.

Between the last time I saw you and the moment I write this letter, so much happened. So much changed.

My father abandoned us and overnight I became the breadwinner of my family. My mother ultimately divorced him. He was a perverted, cheating, conniving narcissist. The aftermath of that came with its own trials and tribulations. We  went into debt. We're still in it. My diagnoses caught up to me. I lost my best friends. I regretted the days I woke up and hated the ones I had to get through. I've been on autopilot ever since.

But this wasn't your fault, you see.

I had been broken for a long time. Both my parents had declared with earnest that they hated me. My time went into raising my brothers in a dysfunctional family so much that when I realised nobody raised me, it was too late. 

Perhaps that's why I was so childish, so immature with all this. I lost all logic, all rationale, all practicality. I wanted that gratification of being wanted and the reward of having you immediately. Spending my last coin so someone can tell me, it'll be okay.

Perhaps, it was because you never liked me and just played along because you didn't know what to do with me. 

Perhaps I was delusional, seeing the world in the shade of your brown eyes.

You showed me colours you know I can't see with anyone else.

I couldn't find that brown hue in trees, in coffee, in candy bars, in wooden furniture. Nowhere. It disappeared with you.

And you know damn well. That I would ruin myself. A million little times.

Therapy sessions lost. Sleep sacrificed. Emotions evicted.

And still I miss you. And I still think I love you.

How do I recover from this? 

Even statues crumble if they're made to wait. I'm so afraid I sealed my fate. No sign of soulmates. 

You left me but how do I leave you?

When will this limerence end?

I don't know why I wrote this. I guess because I wanted to put my love in permanence. To solidify this. To cement it. 

I do miss you, J.

I do love you.

And I'm sorry if my coming into your life made you lose balance. I hope you can forgive for me for any hurt or hindrance I've caused.

You know what they say - the slowest way to kill someone you love is never loving them enough.

I'll never get the closure I deserve. My heart will beat for you time and again. There are more tears scheduled to fall. Sometimes, I hold your stamp so tightly that it bruises my palms. And I will hold that stamp forever. Tucked away in one of my nightstand drawers, is you, tucked away. Out of reach but always in reach when I need it. 

I wonder if you still have mine. 

I don't know if I'll see you again. When you grow up, will you come find me?

We're under the same sun and moon but in different galaxies.

I thought it was goodbye for now.

I wish you the best. I pray you find the girl of your dreams. I hope life goes easy on you.

I confess that I waited. I let the lamp burn. I hoped you'd return. But the shelf life of these fantasies have expired.

Forgive me, J. Please know that I tried to hold on to the days that you were mine.

But the woman who sits by the window, has turned off the light.

Goodbye.

Forever & always yours

Tickets are only like $15, but the catch is the start time is 9 PM 🥲 I used to go to these all the time when I lived in Vegas and they’re super fun, even though they start kinda late for anyone whose birth year begins with 19.

About me: 30F, moved here last month for a new job. I work in defense technology. I stay pretty active and like being outdoors, trying new coffee shops/restaurants, and going to concerts. Not a huge drinker but love being social and will gladly enjoy a cocktail or two anytime. I’m an elder emo (duh) with a particular appreciation for Taking Back Sunday, All Time Low, Something Corporate, and The Starting Line - current favorite bands are The Story So Far, Grayscale, Wage War, The Maine, Belmont, Dayseeker, and Bearings.

I know this may be a little niche, but there’s something out there for everyone! Links for anyone interested:

Price: Unlimited

Size: No more than 40L, but around 30L is probably the sweet spot. 

Use: The majority of the time the bag will be use to and from the office, but sometimes the office requires being outside for extended periods. I’m looking for a one bag solution that looks professional, but can handle real use. The bag should be outside resistant (dust, light rain, rough handling). 

I typically carry
•Medium laptop
•Small iPad
•Other electronics
•Charging cables
•Random small items that need organization
•Occasionally other bulky items like jackets, small boxes, small chair, large headsets, field coffee gear, small tools, food items, books, paperwork, etc.

Thanks to this sub, these are my top picks. Please feel free to add input on these or recommend others.

1. Dakine Spilt Adventure Backpack 38L (ripstop, current version)

My procastionation and scattered thoughts were gone. I was insanely focussed and did all the tasks, exam and presentation. Afterwards I felt a little bit shitty and had to sleep it out of my system. It slightly had the same effect like wellbutrin or ritalin in a lighter version. I googled it and it turned out, that pseudoephedrine combined with caffeine have doping effects.

At the event there is the same amount of snobbery and pretentiousness as a human wine tasting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1i6luqj/wp_a_vampire_attends_a_blood_tasting_at_the_event/)

  
The humans lie on tables, IVs hooked into their arms, the blood dripping into decanters filled with anti-coagulants. White placards are laid out to the side of each specimen. 

“Gym bro, a hemoglobin of fifteen, blood type AB negative,” Emilienne says. “Fifty years old.”

“Past its prime,” Grigor says, pouring himself a small glass from the decanter. He sniffs at the dark red liquid. “Ugh, definitely not a ‘natty’, this one.” 

I don’t know why they’ve invited me here. I prefer my meals like fast food. I get my midnight urges, I go off into the night, and I return home satiated and full of guilt. This kind of languorous contemplative meal seems unnatural. There are candles everywhere, and Emilienne assures me it’s needed for the mood. 

They move on to an ICU nurse, raving about how her blood gives them a head rush, from all the adrenaline and stress. I try to find something I like, but all the placards have too much information. I pick up my meals through open windows, visiting them in the comfort of their own homes. They wake up with a headache and a craving for red meat, but that’s it. These guys on the table, I’m not sure how they’ve been procured or when they’ll be let loose.

I call a nearby waiter. “I’m sorry, I wanted to ask, how did you get these humans?” 

“Don’t worry sir, they’re all ethically sourced,” the waiter assures me. Well, that answers nothing. I had a meal just a few days ago, so I take my time wandering the tables, reading the placards.

Young woman with hemochromatosis and no health insurance. Hemoglobin of sixteen. Hints of coffee from her Starbucks addiction.

Man with forty pack-year history of smoking. Blood that tastes like it was dipped in tobacco. 

Local special! Farmer in his fifties. Taste the sunlight you can never feel directly. 

I take a sip of the farmer’s blood, carrying the small glass around so I don’t look out of place. I don’t taste sunlight. In fact, of everything I’ve tried here, all of them taste the same. Sure, the hypertensives have slightly saltier blood and the hemochromatosis woman was sensory overload, but there’s no ‘hints’ of anything. 

I realize then that the experience is just that. Us pretending like we still have taste buds like humans, like we’re not slaves to our hunger. Grigor comes back.

“I just heard they’re bringing in a celebrity for the next tasting,” Grigor says. “The procurer says his blood tastes of that ten thousand dollar whiskey, with hints of ketamine.”

“Then, I suppose we’ll be returning,” I say, knocking back my glass like it’s tequila instead of blood. A few hours of pretending is fun in a forever of boredom.",1,1740543555.0,arushi,0,1.0,False
