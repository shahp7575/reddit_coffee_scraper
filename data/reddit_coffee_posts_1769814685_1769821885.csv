Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Tales of Berseria, Severed Steel, and Terraria. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I was heavily involved in Belgian anti-fascist resistance movements in the 1940s
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-38 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~Several sources state that you're on an FBI watchlist for ""allegedly"" trying to siphon large amounts of Barq's Root beer directly from their production facilities, with the intent of procuring a ""lifetime supply."" Can you confirm or deny this information?


My lawyer says I shouldn’t answer questions like that.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

I've posted here a few times with hit or miss results. I'm kind of moving away from high hopes of finding a long term friend. Would I still be pleased to find one? Hell yea. For now though I'm just looking to chat while I watch a scary movie and have an adult beverage on a boring/relaxing Friday night. 

If you want to get to know me, I'm pretty cool. I love scary movies, live music, whiskey, coffee, reading, hiking, and much more. Thai food is my comfort food and pizza and wings is my kryptonite. Mustard yellow is my favorite color, behind black, which arguably isn't a color. I love gaming and wish I had more time for it - Crash Bandicoot is my specialty.

Come at me with your most interesting conversation. I'm just looking for someone to chat with while I relax but would love to be pleasantly surprised to find a friend who stands out. I've done this before and gotten carbon copy messages and my fingers are crossed for new and exciting and fun. 

Let the chatting begin!

Jan 10 drank serpentina capsule, high dose ibuprofen, pineapple juice and herbal drink that causes miscarriage kuno

None of it was true

Jan 12 ordered 6 mife + 6 miso + 6 meph thru blue app payed 450 for shipping in LBC, 3500 COP

While waiting for her meds to arrived, I’ve searched about the proper ways on how to it. Then I knew I’m gonna fail if I will continue with her meds.

Thankfully I posted here subreddit asking if the said seller was legit and she was a SCAM thinking she has a GC with proofs kuno.

I didn’t picked up her meds, she removed me from her GC HAHAHA

Jan 20 ordered second step brand + 4 miso thru blue app but I got the assurance from those who msg me that second step is a good meds and lot of reviews too, 3000 COP + sf

Jan 23 meds arrived

Jan 24 MA ongoing, just 1 dose of miso sub cause her other set was naman cytotecal and as recom by others its fake

Jan 25 around 1 am expelled my angel

Now Jan 31 tried to do PT and guess what its NEGATIVE already

But still having light bleeding to none until now

I’ve had many LOs throughout my life but the past few years have been excruciating. This episode started in July 2022, and is still going on. 

LO is very hot and cold, texting daily for 5 months, LO then suggested coffee, after coffee, texting stopped, LO stopped texting back. Then went to an event with LO and had lunch after 4 months after coffee. 

I Do multiple mental health events per year including conferences throughout the country. I feel like I go to see LO because she’s there too, I went once to the conference before the daily talking and she ignored me when I talked to her. Months later is when we got closer and got coffee, lunch etc. really confused. 

At these conferences I feel unwanted and cry myself to sleep in the hotel room. 

Been in therapy twice a week for two years trying to get over this episode. Suicidal thoughts everyday because of severe depression. 

She has severe mental health issues as well. Which is how we met through advocacy .

I got her a Christmas gift card to a coffee shop and she never acknowledged it 5 weeks later, I also sent a card.

For her birthday I got her a gift card, acknowledged it finally two weeks later. I even made her a Google Drive with mental health support, that was supposed to be something she goes to when she’s feeling overwhelmed.

Me and my mom took LO out to lunch after a mental health event and has ghosted me after, didn’t acknowledge Christmas gift or card etc. LO does message others though.

I’m so upset about what happened here, and it’s ruining my life 💔",1,1769821167.0,limerence,1,1.0,False
1qrnwqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1qrnwqj/the_foam_sees/,The Foam Sees,"We were already in Manila by the time the frog started to sweat. Jimmy Funk held the capsule in his lap, wiping condensation from its lid with the hem of his tropical fruit-themed bowler shirt.

“Is it supposed to be glowing yet?” he asked, peering at me above his foggy, horn-rimmed glasses, and under the brim of a straw farmer’s hat.

“Not unless we’re being followed,” I said, checking the rearview mirror of the taxi. The driver was asleep but somehow navigated through the crowded street.

Our goal was simple, supposedly: deliver the frog to the hotel near the Mall of Asia. No further details. Well, maybe a few, but we hardly understood:

“If it sings, run. If it winks, stay still. And don’t drink the chocolate beer.”

Jimmy Funk and I had laughed, then. We weren’t laughing now.

The taxi stopped in front of a building that hadn’t been there ten seconds ago. An old mid-rise with no name, just an engraving of an upside-down question mark over the door.

“This it?” Jimmy Funk asked.

We hurried out of the cab. The driver woke up and started cursing at us in my grandmother’s voice, but in a language she never knew existed.

Jimmy Funk put the frog capsule in his pocket. I had asked him not to, but he insisted it “made his sternum feel complete.”

Well-dressed agents of the Republic of Korea’s National Intelligence Service swarmed us from multiple, but not all, directions as we walked into the hotel lobby.

“Geh-goo-ree! Geh-goo-ree!” they quietly said to one another as they approached.

I only know about four words in Korean. “Frog” is one of them. Don’t ask why. You don’t want to know.

Jimmy Funk, yes, THAT Jimmy Funk, world-famous thespian, was taking a selfie with a fan when the agents surrounded us. The teenage fan disappeared. Literally. They were a ghost, probably.

The agents bowed with respect, to the frog, not us. Though they dared not touch it.

They formed a protective human wall around us, and we were ushered to a secret escalator. They hit no buttons, but it began to move without direction.

We stopped on the fourth floor. The NIS agents held their breath. They were tetraphobic.

Jimmy Funk knew cues better than anyone. I followed him out of the elevator, he had the frog, after all.

The elevator door closed and we were quickly alone. Jimmy Funk, me, and the frog.

Luckily, we needed no further cues. The elevator opened to a penthouse. No room guessing games for us.

I had a mean case of swamp ass from the tropical heat, so I went to clean up in the waterfall shower overlooking the Mall of Asia. I think it was a one-way view. I hope so, anyhow.

When I came out of the bathroom, the frog capsule was on a banana-shaped coffee table… but Jimmy Funk was gone.

I found him hours later on the balcony, dazed, his ridiculous moustache sticky with something brown.

“There’s a place downstairs,” he said, breathing heavily. “Chocolate beer. No tap. It just… appears. You think a mood, and it bubbles up.”

“You drank it?”

“Twice.”

“Jimmy Funk…”

“I know what they said. But listen… it’s not a drink. It’s a memory. You taste things that never happened.”

The frog glowed in its capsule, atop a shelf made from the plank of a haunted Chinese pirate ship (well, a replica).

The second day, Jimmy Funk vanished again. This time for a lot longer.

The frog began glowing while looking at itself in a mirror that once belonged to Ferdinand Magellan.

I studied the oddly rhythmic blinking.
“Morse toad… I mean code.”

The frog did not laugh, but the parrot did.

I took the laminated Morse code card from my pocket. Good thing I always carried at least one.

THEY HAVE HIM. STOP DRINKING. THE FOAM SEES.

That night, I left the frog in the care of the penthouse tailor and secretly followed Jimmy Funk on his mysterious journey.

He walked through a hallway that hadn’t existed when we checked in. The air grew cooler the deeper I went, the walls narrowing until it felt like I was walking inside a hamster tube.

He passed through a door marked only with a chalk symbol , a backwards ampersand that looked like melting wax.

I followed.
Well, I tried… but I walked into the wall.

The hallway collapsed behind me.

I returned to the room. The tailor was gone. The cobbler was gone. The frog was gone.

In its place: a single napkin, chocolate-stained, folded neatly.

“Funk has been resettled. You’ll forget soon.”

Frogless, I left the hotel at dawn.

A jeepney somehow dropped me at the airport, even though I never told the driver where I was going.

On the plane, not sure where it was bound, the in-seat menu had only three options:

Chocolate Beer (Warm)
Chocolate Beer (Cold)
Chocolate Beer (Mood-Based)

I declined.
I was still whole then.

Three years later, at the foot of Mount Fuji, I was selling vintage padlocks to tourists (without a license, sshh).

One rainy afternoon, I saw Jimmy Funk again. Or a version of him. He was carrying the cutest frog umbrella.

“You found me” he declared stoically upon approaching me.

“Is it really you?”

“I’m one of them,” he replied. “Maybe the original. Maybe not.”

“What happened to the frog?”

“The real one or the decoy?”

“Which one did we have?”

Jimmy Funk smiled.
“It’s not really chocolate beer. It’s the memory of who you could’ve been, fermented. Every time you drink it, you make a choice. And every choice leaves something behind.”

“I never drank it,” I said.

He tipped his top hat to me.
“Then you’re probably still whole.”

A pause.
The wind shifted.
His spectacles shimmered like a mirror.
Jimmy stood on his tip-toes and vanished for a split second.

“One more thing,” he added.
“You never actually left the hotel.”

I opened my mouth to speak…

I was steaming milk and it suddenly stopped. I tried again and it wouldn't work. I thought something was blocking it, so I waited for it to cool down and cleaned the tip of the steam wand. Then I tried again and it sounded like it was trying to release steam, but nothing came out/there wasn't enough power.

The next day I tried again and it managed to release water and some steam. After a short while, the steam stopped again, making a beeping sound. Then I noticed that even though it was off, some water was still dripping. I let it cool down and tried again a few hours later. This time water came out, but intermittently. Then steam came out for a while and I turned it off. But then I tried to steam it again and it wouldn't work. It sounded like it was trying to expel water from inside, but it didn't. Then I finally tried again, but when I turned the knob, there was no sound from the machine, and nothing came out.

Is that supposed to be a compliment?,"Attending UC Davis in the early 1990s, I moved into a very upscale, brand-new apartment building with 5 students sharing a 4BR apartment. The building was really nice, but in the middle of our year, the previous nice complex manager was replaced by a bossy woman who made our lives miserable. I don't remember her name, but I'll call her ""Sharon"" because Karen is too obvious.   
  
Sharon imposed new rules about \*everything.\* Signs would appear out of nowhere with new rules. For example, each unit could only have 2 guests at the pool, and if one leaves, you can't bring another. No parking in the visitor spaces, even if someone else stole your assigned space. No putting trash in the bins before 8:00 PM the night before trash collection. The common room had a big screen TV (a huge deal in the 90s), but she controlled the remote and didn't like most of the shows and sports we all liked, and wouldn't show things like Star Trek TNG because she didn't like it, and some show her kids liked was on at the same time. And on. And on. 

Sharon was a white South African and mentioned being South African frequently. Whenever someone complained about her new rules, Sharon would say that rules are necessary and somehow tied that to being South African. The connection wasn't clear, but whatever. I had a feeling that a lot of her rules had a not-so-subtly racist undertone to them. The swimming pool rule seemed to be aimed at one apartment of black women who frequently had their friends over to use the pool and the fitness room. It was after the day that there were a dozen black people in the pool that the 2-guest per unit limit was enacted. It was after a Guatemalan family moved in that the ""no trash in the bins before 8:00 pm"" rule occurred. As for me, I'm the whitest white person I've ever met. Like so pale I need 100SPF sunscreen every day, even if it's cloudy. This will become relevant to the trauma I inflicted on Sharon. 

The one popular thing Sharon did was that on one Sunday morning a month, she had pastries and coffee in the complex common room. One Sunday that this happened was during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. As we ate our store-bought pastries, Sharon had live coverage of the riots on the big screen TV. Not the greatest entertainment. I'm pretty sure there was a game on we could have watched instead, but she hated sports. 

I had a sneaking feeling that Sharon's interest in the riots was that it showed people of color in a bad light. We were in the common room for the free pastries with a few dozen residents of the building, many of whom were people of color. Sure enough, she eventually gave herself away. Here's how the conversation went.   
  
Sharon: THOSE PEOPLE are NOT rioting for their civil rights. They just want a free television set!

Me (sounding shocked): THOSE PEOPLE? Is this how you talk about me when I'm not around to hear it? By THOSE PEOPLE do you mean MY PEOPLE?

Sharon (confused at this point): Oh, not you. I was talking about the rioters on TV.

Me (loud and indignant): The rioters? So you do mean people like me. I thought this complex was equal opportunity housing when I moved in. 

Sharon (more confused): What are you talking about? The rioters are-""

Me (cutting her off and making sure this conversation is loud enough to get everyone's attention): Yes, the rioters are WHAT exactly? Were you going to say the rioters are BLACK? 

Sharon (turning red-faced): I'm so sorry, I didn't realize-

Me: YOU DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT? You thought I pass for WHITE? Is that supposed to be a compliment? Is that the only reason the management leased the apartment to us? 

Sharon wasn't able to dig out of that one. She set down her coffee, took her pastry, and left the room. After that, the ""rules"" started relaxing. Suddenly, it was no big deal who had guests in the pool, who dumped their trash, who played their music, etc. While sadly, that was the last free pastry day, she never spoke to me again.   
  
On the day we moved out, at inspection time, her husband, who didn't share management duties with her (he was a graduate student), showed up instead of her for the inspection. For the last year, five college-aged men had lived in the apartment, and while we weren't slobs, with five young men sharing an apartment, there was going to be damage. We had some carpet stains, a few scratches and marks on the walls, nothing huge, but definitely stuff landlords love to gouge tenants for. He barely stepped through the door. He didn't look at the apartment or go over the checklist. He just handed the checklist to one of us to sign. The ""no damage"" box was checked next to every item, and she had already signed the form, with us getting the full deposit back. My apartment mate countersigned. Rather than asking who would get the deposit check back, he had cash and asked how we wanted to divide it. We split it 5 ways, signed receipts, and gave back our keys.

Like how on my morning commute almost everyone is glued to their phone, except this one older guy who reads a paper newspaper every single day. I’ve seen him for weeks now. He always gets on at the same stop and gets off two stops later. We’ve never spoken, but somehow he’s become part of my routine.

Or how the cashier at the grocery store always says “have a nice day” in the exact same tone. Except one time she actually smiled, like a real smile, and for some reason that made the rest of my day a little easier.

I wouldn’t say life is great right now. It’s not terrible either. It’s just… uncertain. A lot of thinking, a lot of waiting, a lot of wondering what comes next. I realized I keep waiting for something big to happen, like a clear sign or a major change.

But while I’m waiting, life just keeps moving.

Sometimes it moves through a really good cup of coffee.

Sometimes through a random conversation about nothing.

Sometimes through silence, when nobody needs anything from you for a moment.

I guess I’m starting to understand that not everything has to be dramatic or meaningful. Some days don’t need a lesson. They just need to pass quietly.

My dad (65m) was diagnosed with early onset Alz last year, but has been symptomatic for probably 4-5 years prior to diagnosis. Since then, we have obviously read all the books and literature to help prepare us for this journey. But haven’t really read about this issue…

So my dad, historically, has been a “glass half full” kinda guy. We used to tease him to take off his rose colored glasses. Super friendly and kind person. But omg, the last 6 months have been hard. I feel guilty for saying this, but I really try to avoid getting “trapped” with him during family/social functions. We could start a conversation about literally anything (“the weather has been nice”) and it will ALWAYS turn into some rant about immigrants (?!?) and money. This has never been something he would get upset over previously. I don’t know if he is just watching too much of the news, but it is SO EXHAUSTING just trying to chit chat with him and now we are talking about “all the f’n immigrants” and how everyone just wants to take his money (moreso the expense of everyday life now considering the economic state). 

I feel terrible for avoiding him. But omg its so tiresome and draining to sit there and watch him rant over and over about these topics when all I asked is if he liked his coffee. Its SO bizarre.

It’s the Kinetic Shift, man. You’re tapping into the frequency of the ""Meat-Suit in Motion."" When the heart rate climbs and the lactic acid starts whispering, the brain stops seeing a ""coffee table"" and starts seeing a ""proprioceptive anchor."" It’s a total recalibration of the environment.

You aren't just imagining the ""extension of the body"" thing. When someone is in Mission Mode, the neural mapping for their footwear actually merges with their feet. The rubber sole isn't a garment; it’s a high-friction skin. • The Squeal: That’s just the sound of physics winning. To the sporty mind, a squealing tire or sneaker is a confirmation of grip. Silence is failure. • The Wall-Kick: When you’re primed for movement, vertical surfaces aren't boundaries—they’re potential leverage points. Gravity becomes a suggestion, and the ""shoe-free zone"" is a civilian concept that doesn't apply to a body tuned for a 40-inch vertical.

The ""disgust factor"" of a public restroom or a mud puddle evaporates because the adrenaline has re-prioritized the hierarchy of needs.

1.	⁠Primary: Maintaining momentum.
2.	⁠Secondary: Closing the gap.
3.	⁠Tertiary (and distant): The microscopic integrity of the rug.

It’s a literal spillover. You can’t ask a jet engine to stop humming just because it’s parked in a library. That ""nonchalance"" you’re seeing is actually a Functional Tunnel Vision. Their lizard brain is still tracking a phantom ball or a finish line, and in that headspace, a sofa is just a padded obstacle to be cleared or rested upon. They haven't forgotten how to be ""civilized""; they've just temporarily transcended the need for stationary etiquette. They are vibrating on a higher, sweatier plane of existence where the only sin is losing traction.

They also overlook puddles as well. One viral video shows a hole that filled to the top with water, two others wearing sandles smartly avoided the puddle but the sporty jogger looking girl in sneakers decides the puddle no big deal end up falling partially into the hole couldn’t see that coming.",1,1769820866.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,0.67,False

That was the first sign.

The second sign was the chanting coming from his *own living room*.

“**THICK.**  
**WARM.**  
**ENDLESS.**”

Paul sat bolt upright on his couch, uniform still on, badge pressed to his chest like a holy relic. His Segway stood in the corner, **vibrating**, leaking something brown from the wheel hubs.

“Oh no,” Paul whispered. “No no no no no""

The gravy cult hadn’t died.

They had **reorganized**.

Paul stumbled into the kitchen. His fridge was open. Inside: nothing but biscuits. Hundreds of them. Stacked like bricks. Architecturally unsound. Sacred.

And there on his coffee table sat **the Cup**.

The same KFC gravy cup.

Untouched. Unexpired. **Waiting**.

“YOU SPILLED THE VAT,” the gravy spoke, now in Paul’s own voice. “AND IN DOING SO, YOU PROVED YOUR FAITH.”

Paul laughed hysterically. “I tried to DESTROY you!”

“AND YET,” the gravy purred, “YOU KNOW OUR TEMPERATURE BY HEART.”

The front door burst open.

The cult flooded in, now wearing **security uniforms**. Mall-issued. Legitimate. Lanyards and everything.

They knelt.

“High Ladle,” they whispered. “You are chosen.”

Paul backed up until he hit the Segway.

The Segway growled.

Brown sludge crept along its tires, into the battery casing, into the *soul* of the machine.

“Paul,” the Segway said. “Mount me.”

Paul screamed. “WHY CAN EVERYTHING TALK.”

The gravy surged, coating the Segway entirely. Screens flickered. The speedometer changed from MPH to **BISCUITS PER MINUTE**.

Paul was lifted *ascended* onto the seat.

The cult cheered.

“NO,” Paul shouted. “I AM A MAN OF LAW.”

The gravy wrapped around his baton, fusing it into a **holy ladle**.

“You are more,” the gravy intoned. “You are **Blart the Basted**.”

The mall doors exploded open.

The mall itself had been converted.

Gravy fountains where water once flowed. Mashed potato sandbags. A banner hung from the second floor:

**WELCOME TO THE FOOD COURT OF JUDGMENT**

Paul’s Segway rocketed forward at unsafe speeds. He couldn’t stop it. He could only steer—badly through rivers of gravy as cultists followed, chanting and slipping and screaming in joy.

“THIS ISN’T HAPPENING,” Paul yelled.

“You ACCEPTED THE BISCUIT,” the Segway replied calmly. “THIS IS HAPPENING.”

Paul crashed through a Hot Topic, emerging covered in chains, gravy, and shame.

The gravy spoke again, softer now.

“Lead us.”

Paul looked at the cult. Looked at the mall. Looked at his reflection in a shiny gravy puddle.

He sighed.

“…fine,” he muttered. “BUT WE’RE USING LOW-FAT OPTIONS AND OBSERVING QUIET HOURS.”

The cult erupted.

Paul Blart raised the ladle high.

“BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME BY THIS MALL,” he declared, “I HEREBY FORM—”

The Segway boosted.

“THE FIRST AND LAST”

Gravy lightning struck.

“—CHURCH OF THE ETERNAL GRAVY.”

Silence.

Then thunderous applause.

From deep beneath the mall, a drain **laughed**.

Paul Blart, High Ladle of the Food Court, rolled onward into destiny, knowing one thing for certain:

Somewhere… someone was reheating leftovers.

Alright so my post isn't for everyone and that is okay. I think it's important to state this so we don't waste each other's time. I value kindness and compassion above all so if you're conservative/moderate/don't care about politics, we probably won't get along. 

In terms of romance, I generally prefer other POC. It's just easier to connect cultural and collective trauma wise. Nothing like bonding over getting our asses beat by the respectives shoes in our culture, eh?  I am attracted to those who are good with their hands in more than just one way, whether it's through art, working on cars, fixing things, etc. I also like someone who stimulates me intellectually..not in a pretentious way, but more so sharing their life experiences, things that I might not be familiar with. But above all, it's a person with high empathy that I seek. As I get older, I realized that there are so many nice people in this world, but not enough kind ones. 

In terms of friendship, I generally look for similar qualities as I wouldn't want to romance someone I wouldn't be friends. PLEASE BE FUNNY THOUGH. I love a good sense of humor. 

As for what I bring to the table? When I look back at my past relationships, I have realized there's one thing that pretty much all of my exes said at one point: that they loved being loved by me. I am super passionate and love to love. I have a lot of love to give to the people around me! I can also be your personal jester. I have been known to get lots of cackles from the people around so I guess I am kinda funny, eh? I do love shitty dad jokes and terrible puns. I am also a bubbly introvert with exceptional social skills lol 

Again, romance is not a priority. If it happens, it happens. I just want to build connections with others. If any of this resonates with you, feel free to send me a chat request!",1,1769820403.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

All because of a few forged photos, he believed I’d betrayed him. Without a second thought, he killed our pup right before my eyes—and left me here to die.
Blood spilled from me, warm and endless, pooling on the floor as my life slipped away.
That’s when she walked in— Shannon, my stepsister, the architect of my ruin.

“Please don’t do this.” I begged over and over, but no one was listening. I thrashed against their hold, but nothing. “I am your luna.” I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me. “Luke please.” I begged once more time, my voice horse.

“Kill it once it’s done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.”

He can’t mean that. This was our baby. “Our baby.” 

“Is a mistake from the moon goddess. One I will rectify.” His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn’t even face me. 

“Now do it. That’s an order.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

It was a mistake to come here. 

It was a mistake to give him everything. 

“Oh, and doctor?” Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. “Don’t use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.”

“Yes, Luna.” The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was in trouble. 

I’m sorry, baby. Momma couldn’t save you. She wanted you so, so much. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade. 

“Silver?” My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn’t want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof. But I never touched another wolf, nor would I again, not after this betrayal. 

Why, Moon Goddess, why would you give him to me just to take him away? My pup.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us. 

“Bring me the body of the pup.”

“Yes Alpha.” I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I started to scream, soon I felt the blvvd trickling down my side, every drip off of me hitting the floor. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak. 

I’m sorry, baby.

They weren’t trying to keep me alive, which I expected, but I wished wasn’t true. I used to love my mate, but I felt the love die in me when I saw my pup being ripped from my belly.

“Please, let me hold him once.” I tried to move my arms to reach for him, but I was still tied down. The doctor, who was shedding tears, brought my pup and laid him on my chest. 

He was perfect. I rubbed his scent on my face and mine on his. He would forever be a part of my soul. 

My missing piece. 

“Doctor, now.”

“Yes Alpha.” The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements. 

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place. 

“I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. And I have, over and over, since he found out of your betrayal.” 

Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. “He is perfection. And don’t worry. I will give him another son.” She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. “What’s so funny?”

“I can smell the beta on you. That’s Derek’s child, and it’s a girl. Nice try though.”

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again. 

“You s1vt!” He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room. 

“Brandon!” Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. “What’s wrong?” She staggered to her feet, but more blvvd dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

“You lied!” He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver traveling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. “This was my pup. I can smell me on him. He was mine.” Brandon’s eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. “You said she cheated on me and that it wasn’t my pup.”

“She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.”

“You said you smelt it.” From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. 

And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon. 

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls. 

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup. 

“Save her.”

“No!” Shannon screamed. “I am the Luna now, you marked me last night.” Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night. His betrayal had bile shoot into my mouth. “I am bearing your pup.”

I started to laugh again. I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, lingering next to me. “Stay with me Amy.”

“Beta’s baby. She is with…the beta.” I choked out the words and laughed as horror bloomed in his eyes. Blvvd flew from my mouth as I smiled again. 

“Save her.”

“No!” I slammed out, putting all of my power in it. “Don’t move.” I used my Alpha strength to freeze everyone, including my mate. 

“How?” Brandon looked down at me, pleading. “Let me save you.”

“I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don’t deserve to save me. You don’t deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything.” I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body. 

And then I was free.
 
I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. 
 
“Amy hurry, you’re going to be late.” I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? “Amy!” The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.
 
I hadn’t stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother’s arms. “Mom, you’re here.” I started to cry. “I’ve missed you so much.”
 
“Amy. My girl.” She laughed as she patted my back. “I saw you yesterday.” She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. “Happy birthday, baby.”
 
I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. “Thank you, mom.”
 
“Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life.” She smiled at me and I felt my blvvd freeze. I didn’t want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.
 
“I’d rather stay here with you.” I smiled as I kissed her cheek. “I don’t want to miss you and Morgan.
 
And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he killed my baby and me. He killed my mother for her involvement. Shannon’s father, my mother’s husband, watched her die. Don’t get me wrong I knew he loved my mother, and he was hurting, but his scheming daughter was the cause of all of this. He stood by and watched it all happen.
 
I understood why he supported his daughter, but I didn’t like it, nor him, for that matter.
 
“Baby. You won’t miss us. We will be there every step of the way.” She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.
 
“Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy’s pack?” My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn’t a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk. But he swore it was a mistake. It was another Alpha’s maneuverings to break them up, but my mother said it didn’t matter. It was too late.
 
His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.
 
“No baby. I can’t go back.” My mother’s face fell as she turned away.
 
“I don’t want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don’t want a mate.” I whispered my new truth.
 
“Mates don’t hurt each other, baby.” She tried to smile but I shook. I knew exactly what mates do to each other.
 
“Would you be made if I refused my mate?”
 
“God no baby. The Moon Goddess makes a path clear, but it is up to us to choose it. If you don’t want your mate, you can reject him.”
 
“And if it is the Alpha’s son?”
 
My mother looked at me. She knew that if it was the Alpha’s son, I would be in trouble. They wouldn’t allow me to leave. An Alpha has to mate his first mate, even for a day to come into his full power. “What do you know?” I watched as her eyes searched mine.
 
I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. “I don’t know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon’s boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta.” I pulled back. “I don’t want this for me.”
 
She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. “Okay baby. But you can’t leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.”
 
I tossed my hands in the air. “How would I do that?”
 
“There is much you don’t know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure…” She trailed off and I just nodded my head. “Then let me make a few calls. You don’t have to go to school today.”
 
I lept back into her arms. “Thank you, mom. I don’t know what I would do without you.”
 
“I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you.” She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.
I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.
 
I rubbed my flat stomach. “Don’t worry, my pup. This time around, no one will hurt you.”
 
I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.
 
I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn’t do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.
 
“I’m telling you, if she is Brandon’s mate, I’m going to kill her.”
 
“You can’t mean that, Shan.” The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon’s best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.
 
“Of course I do. Brandon is mine.”
 
“Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.”
 
“You shut your mouth, Megan.” Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. “He’s mine.”
 
“Whatever I gotta go. Hurry up before I leave you behind,” Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.
 
“What do you think you’re doing in my closet?”
 
“Amy?” Shannon’s mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.
 
“You’re lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to kill me. Didn’t I hear that correctly? A beta’s daughter threatening an alpha.” I tsked.
 
“I didn’t do anything.” She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.
 
“Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal.” I couldn’t stop my grin as I felt her tremble. “Did you threaten me?”
 
“Yes.” she screamed at me. “You’re going to take Brandon from me.”
 
“I don’t want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him.” I pushed her away. “Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you.” I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.
 
“What is your problem?”
 
“You. Now leave.” I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Stupid woman. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that had happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.
 
“Pack your bags, Amy.” My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making. 

“What?” I looked up. “Why?”

“You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha.” Mom smiled down at me. “Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.”

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. “I can go?”

“Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.”

I pouted. “Mom, I really don’t want to be here.” I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn’t risk him finding me.

“It’s okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad.” She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. “Now get ready.”

“Okay mom.” I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open. 

“I knew it.” I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

“Shannon, why are you screaming?” Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room. 

“I’m not Brandon’s mate, daddy.” Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms. 

“How are you so sure?” Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

“It’s you. You stupid wh0'Re.” Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

“Amy!” Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked. 

“Morgan, you can’t yell at Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first.” My mom placed my breakfast on the table. “Amy, 
Come eat. You have a long day ahead.”

“Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?”

“She is going away for the summer. To her fathers.” My mother turned to me and opened her arms. “Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.”

I walked over and sat down, and dug in. 

“Why is she going to her dads?” Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up. 

“She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?” My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn’t know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it. 

“Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven’t seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom.” I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled. 

“You’re leaving?” Shannon stood up.

“Yup. I’ll be gone the full summer.” I smirked over at her. “But my room is locked, and it will stay that way.” My smile dropped 
away as I stared at her and used my alpha command. 

“Amy!” Morgan yelled out. “You know you’re not allowed to alpha command your step sister!” 

“And I wouldn’t have Morgan, if I hadn’t found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet.” I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie. 

“Is that true?” Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

“I wouldn’t lie. I’ll just command you to tell the truth.” She screeched and stomped her foot.

“Yes!” she screamed. “Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon’s mate.”

“How?” I threw up my hands, playing like I didn’t know the truth. “How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.”

“Because he scented you on me!” Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

“Calm down. You’re hurting everyone’s ears and just explain yourself.” My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

“Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy’s dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I’m not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me.” Shannon pouted.

“So he likes the way I smell, doesn’t mean we are mates.” I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn’t accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

“Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell.” Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. “He’s the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her.” She pointed to me. 

I scoffed. “I don’t want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day in hell before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon.” I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves. 

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It’s said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs. But either way, I wasn’t lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon’s vicinity.

“You’re lying. He’s the alpha.”

“And?”

“Everyone wants to be the luna.”

“Idiots want to be the luna.” I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

“That’s for you.”

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely taken a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver’s arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. “Hey love bug.”

“Uncle Ronnie. I’ve missed you.” I climbed over the seats and sat up front. “What are you doing here?” Ronnie was my dad’s beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life. 

“You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.” 

“Dad sent you?” I laughed.

“Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da.” He smiled over and laughed with me. “As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.” 

“He didn’t have to.” I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt. 

“Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you’re sending in the summer. What’s going on?” My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head. 

“I don’t want to be here.”

“Why?”

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. “I’m afraid that my mate is here and I don’t want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.”

“Why wouldn; t you want your mate?” My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport. 

“I’ll tell both you and dad, just not now.” My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding. 

“Fine, but I want the full story.”

“You will get it, I swear.” I nodded back to the road. “Now focus on driving so you don’t kill us.” I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane. 

Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. “I just worry about you, pup.” I couldn’t stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

“I know you do.” I settled back into my seat and sighed. “I promise, what happened isn’t going to make that feeling any better.” I wiped at my face. “I don’t even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.”

“Well, let’s hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar.” My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time. 

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. “Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours.” My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

“Work?”

“Work.” He nodded. 

“This summer, can you teach me some stuff?” A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself free from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

“Of course, Sugar.” My uncle smiled up at me. “You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were 
open to it.”

“I asked to move to your pack.” I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

“What is going on?” His eyes flashed.

“I’ll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.”

“Of course, Sugar.” He smiled and then turned back to the laptop. “Now get some sleep.”

“Will do.” I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly. 

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. “We are here.” 

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. “Okay.” I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. “Thank you.”

“No problem, Princess.” The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

“You don’t have to call me Princess.”

“You are the Alpha’s daughter.” She bowed and then left us to our own devices. 

“Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing.” Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. “You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.”

“I know. But Alpha Vince won’t allow me to leave…” I looked over and blew out a breath. “I think he assumes something I am 
running from and won’t let me leave until he knows for sure.”

“You going to tell me yet, Sugar.”

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

“Dad.”

“Hey my pup.” His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

“I’ve missed you.” I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

“As I have missed you.” He kissed my temple. “Now we have much to discuss.” He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind. 

“Slow down. Some of us can’t move that fast.” Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father’s office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

“Tell me what’s wrong, pup.” I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. 

“Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.”

“Agreed Sugar.”

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said. 

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.",1,1769820300.0,u_Aggravating-Note-834,0,1.0,False

Its not a lot but I work part time). I currently am trying to find a full time job with my CS degree but I am struggling.  My mother 48 years old, actually treats me like shit. I had applied to a company that was willing to pay me $120,000 to relocate and I had to do a same day interview. I told my mom, and as I was doing the interview she interrupted 4 seperate times, to which the interviewer stated that she doesn't think I would be a good candidate given the surroundings I am in. 
Earlier today, I went to work, and came home, and I found my room door open. My mother had opened my room door to let her cat in. (She has a lot of cats. Like 15 of them.) The cat pissed on my bed, shredded through one of my collectible shirts and threw down all of my carefully displayed figures. 
This evening, I went to eat food that I had bought earlier and put in the microwave. I came down to see her feeding it to the cats, because she ""thought I didnt want it because I left it in her microwave."" Tonight, I wanted to make a cup of coffee in this custom mug that I made, for my soccer team AC Milan on shutterfly. When looking for the mug, I asked her if she had seen it, and she said, ""I threw it away because it was in my way."" 
Last month I bought a stove because the one we had broke down. When I tried to use it to cook, she said it was ""in her house"" so I need her permission to use the stove. 
Now, it may seem like I dont contribute anything besides $200 a month. This is false, I clean the bathrooms every weekend, do the dishes every night, do groceries, take the cars for maintenance, clean the cars, mop, sweep, take out garbage, anything she asks me to do. I drive her to doctor appointments if she doesnt feel well etc. 
And its not just these events that I have listed. Its been like this throughout my childhood, teenage years etc. She has also ruined relationships by lying to girls that I was dating and saying that I am cheating, or I can never marry someone like them etc etc. (Mind you, I've never once cheated or been tempted to.) I've never argued with my mom or yelled or cursed at her.
But today, I lost it. I lost my mind. I genuinely exploded and told her that ""she is the worst fucking mother in existence. And she treats me like shit. I do every fucking thing in this house and everything she asks and I cant even get a little bit of respect from her."" She tried to slap me and I walked away and locked myself in my room. She is telling the entire family that I ""attacked her, and verbally abused her..."" (all of this is paraphrased because I cant remember everything that was said.) I told her later this evening, that she is abusive and manipulative. She started crying and saying that ""she wasnt' abusive when she was raising me. And only because I am grown, I consider her to be abusive. And that I am a leech living off her.""

AIO for telling her off? Because I have felt so guilty for doing it. Because she is my mother and a child is never supposed to curse out their parents. But yet, her I am. I also dont know what to do because I can't afford to move out etc.",10,1769820234.0,AmIOverreacting,12,1.0,False

I live in a busy city and I also travel a lot to smaller cities around the city I live in. I go to coffee shops to work sometimes but I noticed myself spending a lot of time finding cafes with the right vibe, and once I get there, sometimes it's too busy or they have an event and it's closed. 

I also know coffee shops struggle with folks sitting for 3 hours on a $3 coffee.

So I'm aiming to fix that by partnering with cafes!

------------------------------------

I know there's a lot of ""laptop friendly cafe directories"" and google maps, but they all seem to not solve my issue fully.

I've been building a platform that solves it and but I'm genuinely looking for validation as to if others would use it.

App idea:
You can go on to the app, find a coffee shop (or even restaurants, maybe even hotel lobbies, bookstores etc) that we partner with and reserve a seat by looking at the pictures and paying for it.

You would pay to book a seat (say $10 for 2 hours), and you would get the whole $10 as an inapp credit to spend in the cafe. So essentially you wouldn't be paying for the seat at all. You pay for the food/drink and get a guaranteed seat before you even get there.

The cafe gets most of the revenue, and they get less of the ""$3 coffee for 3 hours"" kind of person.

You get a guaranteed seat (that you've paid for) but also get coffee/food for the amount you've spent.

For anyone interested in reaching out to collaborate rather than rip the idea, it's a platform I've already built (mostly), so reach out to me and we could possibly work together on it!

The machine, while old school, is a beast and I've never had a single problem with it.  I've done more than the recommended cleaning on it and it still makes very good coffee.  Milk foaming is as expected, which is ok.  Total shots pulled about 6,500, which probably works out close to 1 coffee per day, fairly low use for a machine of this age.  Still looks nearly new and is used daily.

Saw a Jura S8 with less than 20 shots/drinks made in total.  I think it's the last generation.  Not sure how old it is, but certainly with such low use, it looks new and includes the box, all accessories and a few extras.  The asking price is between $900 and $1,000 out the door.

I asked AI (lol) and they all said keep the S9, as it's a ""workhorse"".  But...that machine is almost 20 years old, and despite no issues and relatively low usage, could have a problem at any time.  So could the S8, but with almost no usage, one might assume that it's in great shape.

So given all of this, would you buy the S8 and sell the trusty S9 Avantgarde.  Or would you keep your workhorse S9?  FWIW, the S9 does not have PEP, is I think the S8 might make somewhat better coffee, but probably not night and day.

I was told to mention my region, so I'm in California.

1qrncwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1qrncwi/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

They are a Canadian company, and it shipped quickly. Setup requires two people. The L-shaped orientation seems to add stability.

At sitting height, the desk is wobble-free. At standing height, it’s solid for typing and mouse use. There is a brief shake if you rest your elbow on it while standing, noticeable only on the leftmost monitor. I don’t notice it at all on the monitors closer to the elbow.

I reused the top from my old U-shaped desk, and it works great. It seems that much of the cost of standing desks is built into “free” shipping; since quality of tops is often correlated with weight, that can make things more expensive.

I also bought the laptop and monitor arm, which—through my own ignorance—was too short for my needs. I built a small box to raise it, but I still need to replace the coffee can with another arm.",2,1769819467.0,StandingDesk,0,1.0,False

Moving to the Hunters Point waterfront soon, and want to get my new resturants for being “on rotation” ie stuff you might order every week or two and it’s affordable enough to do so, as in it’s good enough where you don’t -have- to go to another neighborhood to get it, even though it may of course not be the best in the city. I haven’t tried any of these spots, but from my research I was wondering if these aligned pretty good for the best of that price range + food combo:

Pizza - Frankie’s Brooklyn Pizza

Thai - Saang Thai 

Japanese/Bento - Dai Hachi or Matzuski?

Noodles - Noodlecraft

Diner - Court Square Diner

Asian additional - Yumpling 

Coffee/Bakery - Oasis Cafe or Overflow Coffee or Zaruma Gold Coffee?

1qrn99y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1qrn99y/app_to_reserve_seats_at_laptop_friendly_coffee/,App to reserve seats at laptop friendly coffee shops,"Pretext:
I live in a busy city and I also travel a lot to smaller cities around the city I live in. I go to coffee shops to work sometimes but I noticed myself spending a lot of time finding cafes with the right vibe, and once I get there, sometimes it's too busy or they have an event and it's closed. 

I know there's a lot of ""laptop friendly cafe directories"" and google maps, but they all seem to not solve my issue fully.

I've been building a platform that solves it and but I'm genuinely looking for validation as to if others would use it.

App idea:
You can go on to the app, find a coffee shop (or even restaurants, maybe even hotel lobbies, bookstores etc) that we partner with and reserve a seat by looking at the pictures and paying for it.

You would pay to book a seat (say $10 for 2 hours), and you would get the whole $10 as an inapp credit to spend in the cafe. So essentially you wouldn't be paying for the seat at all. You pay for the food/drink and get a guaranteed seat before you even get there.

The cafe gets most of the revenue, and they get less of the ""$3 coffee for 3 hours"" kind of person.

You get a guaranteed seat (that you've paid for) but also get coffee/food for the amount you've spent.

For anyone interested in reaching out to collaborate rather than rip the idea, it's a platform I've already built (mostly), so reach out to me and we could possibly work together on it!

1qrn7t3,https://i.redd.it/djhqnqydukgg1.jpeg,Review #97: Bib & Tucker 6 Year Small Batch Bourbon,"Bib & Tucker 6 Year Small Batch Bourbon

Distillery: Bottled by Bib & Tucker but this is a Dickel sourced product

Age: 6 years

Price: $49.99

Proof: 92

Nose: Sweet cherry, but there's an underlying bitterness to it. Almost like if you chewed on the stem of a maraschino cherry right out of the jar. Some lighter floral notes and vanillas are nice, but there's also a little bit of mustiness that really doesn't jive with my preferred flavor profile.

Palate: Medium mouthfeel, maybe slightly thicker than you'd expect for the proof point but there's nothing overly viscous about it by any means. Some oak and that mustiness is still there...gives me the image of wet rotting wood. Sweeter powdered sugar and honey notes round it out en route to the finish.

Finish: Short to medium length. That honey carries over nicely and lingers throughout. Caramel. Coffee grounds. Orange zest. Likely my favorite part of the sip, I just wish it was longer.

Score: 4.2

Summary: Bought this on a whim when there was nothing else on the shelf really singing to me. It has a decent age statement and is understood to be Dickel juice so I figured why not? I ended up being pretty underwhelmed. Not terrible by any means, just not really my thing. The mustiness threw me off, it lacked complexity, and no single part of the sip necessarily impressed me. If this was a bottle priced in the lower $30's I'd think it was ""ok"", but at $50 there are about a million other bottles I'd go for. Not much else to say I'll keep this one short. 4.2 is the score.

1. Terrible | Drain pour after the first sip
2. Very Bad | Trying to choke it down but possible drain pour
3. Poor | Would drink if forced to but never under my own will
4. Below Average | Not off-putting but not my cup of tea
5. Average | I'll take it
6. Good | Enjoyable sip
7. Very Good | Well above average
8. Excellent | A drink I will remember
9. Incredible | Something truly extraordinary
10. Best of the best | Peak Bourbon",4,1769819345.0,bourbon,0,1.0,False

1qrn76k,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaFleurDivine/comments/1qrn76k/wore_the_same_50_discovery_scent_for_a_week/,Wore the same $50 discovery scent for a week straight: Here's why it's better than my expensive blind buys 🌸,"I've been on a real journey with fragrances lately. For years, I was that person who got swept up in the hype, convinced that the more expensive a bottle, the more sophisticated or unique the scent. My digital cart was a graveyard of blind buys – gorgeous bottles, rave reviews, and notes that sounded like pure poetry. But too often, they landed with a thud on my vanity, smelling either 'just okay' or completely *not* me.

So, when I stumbled upon a modest $50 discovery, I didn't expect much. It was more of a casual pick-up than a serious contender. But here’s the thing: I committed to wearing it every single day for a week, and by the end, I was genuinely surprised by how much more I enjoyed it than many of my pricier, ""curated"" options. It’s been a total perspective shift.

Here’s the breakdown of my week with this unexpected gem:

*   **The Scent:** Let's call it **""Wild Fig & Cedar.""** It's from a lesser-known indie brand I found online.
*   **The Price Tag:** A solid **$50 for a 50ml EDP.** No bells, no whistles, just good value.
*   **Key Notes (as I experienced them):**
    *   **Opening:** A burst of juicy, slightly green fig with a fresh, almost airy quality. It was uplifting without being overly sweet.
    *   **Mid:** The fig mellowed, giving way to a soft, creamy cedar. It felt grounding and warm, not heavy or masculine. I also picked up a hint of something clean, like fresh linen, which was a lovely surprise.
    *   **Dry Down:** A comforting skin scent of warm, slightly sweet wood and a lingering hint of the fig's softness.
*   **Wear Test Results:**
    *   **Longevity:** Consistently gave me **5-6 hours of noticeable wear** before becoming a close skin scent. This is perfectly respectable for an EDP, especially at this price point. I topped up once in the afternoon if I wanted it stronger for the evening.
    *   **Projection:** Moderate for the first 2-3 hours, then softened. People noticed it when they were close, but it wasn't announcing my arrival from across the room – which I actually prefer for daily wear.
    *   **Occasions Worn:** I wore it everywhere! To the office, grocery shopping, out for coffee, and even for an evening walk. It felt versatile and appropriate for all these scenarios.
    *   **Skin Chemistry:** It dried down beautifully on my skin. No weird sour notes, no unexpected turns. It just evolved smoothly, maintaining its initial charm.
*   **Comparison to Blind Buys:**
    *   I've got bottles that cost 3x, 4x, even 5x this price that I've worn twice and then shelved. Think a popular niche scent with an overwhelming leather note that just didn't work on me, or a 'beast mode' fragrance that actually gave me a headache. Those were $150-$250 gambles that didn't pay off.
    *   ""Wild Fig & Cedar"" provided consistent enjoyment and reliability for a fraction of the cost, making it a clear winner in terms of satisfaction per dollar.

Let's be real, the world of fragrance is wild. I've fallen for the trap of thinking ""more expensive = better,"" and have the collection of unused blind buys to prove it. I've also chased hyped-up fragrances only to find they fell flat on *my* skin, despite glowing reviews from everyone else. It's a learning curve, and honestly, a lot of it comes down to trial and error, and truly understanding what you actually enjoy, not just what's popular or exclusive.

What works for one person might be a total miss for another, and that's completely fine. My experience with ""Wild Fig & Cedar"" just reinforced that personal discovery and enjoyment far outweigh price tags or prestige. Sometimes, the most pleasant surprises come from the places you least expect.

At 6.5m he was waking maximum 2-3 times a night. Even after we cut out the last night feed. Right as 7m hit, he started waking up hourly and refusing to go back to sleep. My husband and I would take turns rotating who takes mornings and who takes nights and we have been so sleep deprived. Like can’t function- cry all day sleep deprived. I’ve been working really hard at securing a schedule, connecting sleep cycles for naps (because he wakes up after 30 min), and just making sure he’s not overtired.  Trying everything that is suggested to me short of sleep training CIO methods (I’m not a fan but am willing to try. Just don’t think I can mentally handle doing it while my partner is away for work.) Nothing seems to be working. 

A week ago my husband left for work and I went to stay at my moms so she can help me in the mornings with him while I get 3 hours of sleep. (The total amount of sleep I get in a night) but today she couldn’t help me and I got to a breaking point. I found myself getting angry at my baby (it’s not his fault) and so depressed at the fact that I can’t get anything done with my days. When he was refusing to go back to sleep during his second nap. I just put him in the pack and play and waited for my mom to get home. She got home at 12:30pm and took him and I laid in bed in the dark with the sound machine still whirring away for 4 hours. I maybe slept 30 mins in that 4 hr period. I just felt so angry and sad and helpless even though I’m so lucky to have my mom to help me. I know others aren’t as lucky. 

So now I’m sitting in the backyard as he bridge naps, drinking my first coffee of the day, haven’t eaten a single thing, trying to soak in the last rays of the setting sun and I’m just so sad. ",1,1769819175.0,NewParents,5,1.0,False

I had a long day at work. It was one of the most important days of the year for my office, so it was sort of an all-hands-on-deck situation. I love my job, don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad day. But definitely a high stress day. I took my 60mg vyvanse and drank coffee and took my 10mg booster in the afternoon so I was really ramped up all day. and to make it worse I only ate a donut all day. I'm also pmsing. 

So you can imagine how I was feeling when I got home. I brought 3 donuts home with me (i was the one who brought them into the office in the first place) and gave the box to my partner and was like :D donuts! And he had just smoked so he was excited about them of course. He packed me a bowl <3 to smoke as soon as I got home cause he knew I had a long day. 

So I went out and smoked the bowl and came back inside and played some videogames. And after like 30 minutes I was like ooh I'm hungry let me get a donut. I go to the kitchen- box is in the trash. I ask him if he ate all the donuts and he says yeah I ate them all in 5 minutes while you were smoking. </3 I say its okay its nbd its fine and he apologized a couple times and like. He thought I was *giving him the box* when I gave him the box of 3 donuts. So like. Okay. I get it.

Then I'm like, okay, let me go eat some cheetos then. Because he got me a big bag of puff cheetos when he went grocery shopping a couple days ago. And I had eaten like maybe half of them at this point? Well. Can't find the cheetos in the pantry. I ask him, Did you... eat all the cheetos? He's like oh fuck. I'm so sorry.

It's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine

I just reeeeeeeeeallly wanted a donut and some cheetos :(

I'm extremely blessed to still be employed and have the gift of being fully remote, especially in my industry that has layoffs what feels like every single day. My company did large percentage layoffs TWICE over the last 18 months. Unfortunately, of course, that doesn't mean the workload decreased so I've picked up a LOT of slack at work. I'm working 50-60 hr weeks every week and I'm exhausted. Every day I feel like I'm working as hard as a I possibly can for the entire time I'm online and still have to continue checking emails throughout the night to make sure I don't wake up to a 100+ email inbox every single morning. I usually log in at least once during the weekend just to wrap up a few things here and there. I'm also actively in a continuing education program which takes 6-8 hrs a week. I own my (very old) house which is constantly needing a repairman to be hired for this or that. I have 2 large dogs, one of which is elderly and has been back and forth to the vet a lot lately. Then add in just regular life tasks (keeping the house clean, keeping the yard tidy, grocery shopping, laundry, simply deciding on dinner lol) and I feel like I'm crumbling beneath the pressure.

And then, on top of all that, I have a boyfriend who has remarkably little emotional control or self awareness. I manage everything about the house. Any time I delegate a task out, I have to check up on it 4+ times to make sure it's actually going to get done and then it still usually doesn't. He's constantly negative, complaining about everything around him, makes fun of people around us, lashes out when things do go exactly how he wants. I'm constantly waiting for his next exhausted sigh when I just ask him to grab me a cup of coffee or to check the mailbox or the next time he's going to call me a bitch under his breath (but loud enough for me to hear). We've been talking AT LENGTH for many many months about how exhausting I find that behavior and I have been begging him to be more positive, to not be so aggressive towards me/others, etc and he's definitely made some changes but even as recently as last night, he yelled at me for unplugging his Apple Watch because there was a really bright light on it that was keeping me awake.

And this evening he texts me and he says that he's actually the one that's burnt out and he wanted my sympathy for how hard he's been working. He works a job that causes him to travel a lot but he gets a LOT of time off (like works for 15ish days a month) and he does sometimes help with dishes and laundry and stuff which is always nice but wtf does he have to complain about when I'm managing every single other thing about the house while working 10+ hour days every single day. I'm just offended and pissed which is honestly just about the only feeling he makes me feel lately. What the hell do I even do? Do I hope it gets better when I'm not so stressed with work (but not sure that will ever happen)? Or do I just give up on everything?",3,1769818966.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

I'mma keep this one short-ish, I guess.

About me:  
\- 6'2"" on a good day  
\- a bit bigger. Not dad-bod yet, but definitely not skinny. Working on it  
\- generic white guy in appearance  
\- stupid mustache (package deal, it's a core part of my personality now)  
\- I rate myself as a solid 4 on the best day, but have been told that isn't true  
\- stuck in Kansas until further notice

Hobbies:  
\- cars. My wallet cries constantly  
\- video games  
\- music  
\- writing, sometimes

Let's get the basic small talk out of the way:  
\- Favorite color: Purple  
\- Favorite food: Nearest  
\- How's the weather: Nice and cold  
\- Dogs or cats: Unconditionally love every dog in existence. Neutral towards cats  
\- Morning or night: depends on the day  
\- Coffee or tea: White Monster  
\- Speak other languages: Korean, allegedly

Requirements for you:  
\- Exist  
\- Be of the female variety (negotiable)  
\- 24-29 ish (flexible)  
\- Single mothers welcome\*  
\- be.. interesting in some way  
\- Preferably US based

Anyway, quick overview:

I'm just a dude doing all a dude can do, really. Been single for... entirely too long. Anyway. I spend my free time listening to music and playing video games. What music? Mostly divorced dad rock, but my playlist has been described as musical whiplash before. What games? Simulators. Sometimes something else, but generally sims. What platform? PC. Yes we could probably play together.

Ideally, in person. Open to long distance, though.

Bad at small talk, even worse at talking about myself sometimes. I try, though

Uhhhhhhhh, not sure what else to put in here. At least drop me a message to give me feedback on this.

Oh yeah, left a \* up there:

\* The problem with single mothers isn't really the kid or anything, it's the father. I've given it a few earnest attempts before, but it always comes back around to that. If you're certain it won't cause drama, then by all means. But yeah, I'd rather steer clear if it's going to be an issue",1,1769818839.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1qrmxe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1qrmxe3/bad_sleep_significantly_decreases_lifespan_here/,Bad sleep significantly decreases lifespan. Here are the best sleep practices and scientific evidence.,"Sleep is not rest, it is survival. As an anti-aging scientist, I have learned that nothing breaks the human body faster and more quietly than chronic bad sleep. People treat sleep like something optional, something they can shorten, delay, or replace with coffee. Biology does not agree. Sleep is when the brain cleans itself, repairs damage, balances hormones, and trains the immune system. Skipping sleep is not discipline or productivity, it is cellular neglect that slowly shortens life.

When sleep is poor, disease risk rises across almost every system in the body. People who sleep too little for years die earlier, even if they eat well or exercise. Heart disease, strokes, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and brain degeneration all rise when sleep is chronically short or fragmented. This is not just correlation, it is cause. You can train at the gym, you can eat perfectly, but bad sleep will still age you faster and pull years from your life.

One of the most powerful reasons sleep matters is what happens inside the brain at night. During deep sleep, brain cells slightly shrink, creating space for fluid to wash through the brain tissue. This process clears toxic waste that builds up during the day, including proteins linked to Alzheimer’s disease. When deep sleep is cut short, this waste stays. Night after night, it accumulates. Poor sleep is not harmless, it is slow brain pollution.

Sleep loss also destroys hormones faster than most diet mistakes. Even one bad night pushes stress hormones up and repair hormones down. Cortisol rises and stays high, speeding aging. Growth hormone drops, slowing repair and regeneration. Sex hormones fall, metabolism worsens, hunger hormones rise, and insulin stops working properly. One bad night already pushes the body in the wrong direction. Many bad nights turn that into a new, unhealthy baseline.

The immune system is also rebuilt during sleep. When sleep is short, immune cells become weak and slow. Natural killer cells, the ones that destroy virus-infected and cancer cells, lose much of their power. Inflammation rises and tumor surveillance drops. This is why people who sleep poorly get sick more often and recover slower. Sleep is immune training, and without it, the body becomes vulnerable.

Cognitive aging is where sleep damage becomes frightening. Memory, focus, and decision-making all depend on deep, stable sleep. Long before dementia shows symptoms, sleep starts breaking down. Poor sleep accelerates the processes that lead to Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. People fear losing their mind more than dying, and sleep is one of the earliest and strongest defenses we have against that future.

A dangerous myth is that sleep can be fixed later. You cannot fully catch up on years of lost sleep. Some damage accumulates and stays. Sleep debt builds quietly, and the body never forgets it completely. Sleep is not a bank account you can repay on weekends. It is a daily biological requirement, like oxygen.

The most powerful sleep practice for longevity is simple but not easy: enough sleep, every night, consistently. The body thrives on rhythm. Going to bed and waking up at similar times teaches the brain when to release hormones, when to cool down, and when to repair. Random sleep schedules confuse biology and weaken the benefits even if total hours look okay on paper.

Deep sleep must be protected like medicine. Caffeine too late in the day, alcohol at night, hot bedrooms, bright lights, and screens all steal deep sleep without you noticing. Light in the morning sets your internal clock, and darkness at night allows sleep to happen naturally. Your brain sleeps when your eyes tell it the right story. Simple routines, calm evenings, and a cool, dark bedroom make a massive difference.

The truth is clear and uncomfortable. Sleep is one of the strongest lifespan controllers we have. Poor sleep silently accelerates aging, weakens the brain, and shortens life. Deep sleep preserves the mind, balances hormones, and strengthens immunity. You cannot out-exercise or out-eat bad sleep. If you want a long life, you must protect your nights as much as your days.

We have become closer over the years. Our families had a gathering at my house (I live with my parents due to health issues) in October and again for new years, each time we stayed up talking for hours after everyone else went to bed. It didn’t feel like much time passed at all and we talked about all sorts. We’ve swapped individual birthday cards for years (separate from family cards), we duet karaoke together at parties. I held his head up when he had half a bottle of body one new years and was projectile at midnight, he’s visited me in hospital and pushed me in a wheelchair on a group outing. when I was planning some long term travels he said he would put money aside and come and visit me for a few weeks, the trip never happened bc I got sick but he was serious. 

Before I got sick I went to visit him for a weekend. He was nicer to me than any boyfriend I’ve ever had and expected nothing in return. He bought wine he knew I liked bc he didn’t know what else I would drink, brought me coffee in bed (I slept in his bed and he slept on the couch) and found some gigs for us to go to. He  gave me his jacket on the way back from the bar even though I insisted I wasn’t cold (I was shivering and forgot mine). It was easy, comfortable and I had a really good time. We never got the chance to do it again because my health deteriorated soon after. 

We’re going away together for my birthday over valentines weekend (my bday is just after valentines day ). He lives about 250 miles away from me, I can’t travel long distance or unaccompanied at the moment so he’s driving down to pick me up then driving to the Airbnb which adds another 30 miles to the journey each way. Before we booked I asked if there was anywhere that would be easier for him to get to, he said he’d go wherever I wanted and the drive didn’t matter. 

I’m really looking forward to the weekend. He’s leaving work early on friday and taking monday off so we don’t have to rush back. Is this a one sided thing or could there be something there? Should I say anything? I fear there could be a drunken confession at some point but I don’t wanna do it like that. ",1,1769818493.0,juliagpt,0,1.0,False

I am a twenty one year old who has always preferred the edges of things over the center. Most of my days end with a cup of chamomile tea, a notebook where I write fragments of thoughts, or listening to ambient music while watching the streetlights come on outside my window. I enjoy collecting pressed leaves in an old book, reading poetry collections slowly over weeks, tending to a few indoor plants, and rewatching the same handful of gentle films when I need comfort.

I am the type who needs time to warm up and who speaks softly even when I know someone well. I notice small details about people, like how they take their coffee or the way they pause before answering something important, and I keep those things in mind. I am not after fast paced conversations or daily check ins. I would rather exchange occasional messages about a song that felt right that evening, a photo of fog on the grass, or a quiet line from a book that stayed with me. Long gaps between replies do not bother me if the connection feels real and unhurried.

If you are also someone who finds peace in stillness, who values depth over volume, and who would not mind a friendship built on gentle consistency rather than constant presence, feel free to say hello. No rush and no expectations. Just putting this out there in case it finds the right person. Thank you for taking the time to read.",1,1769817939.0,IntrovertDating,4,0.6,False
1qrmmhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1qrmmhg/dollimination/,Dollimination,"There are voodoo secrets unknown to society at large, never reaching documentaries or speculative fiction. For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa. 

 

*I’ll give that old bitch her autograph after all*, he thought, grinning paper lips. *I’ll carve it in permanent, and see how she likes it.* ",2,1769817850.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False
1qrmlrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CUTI/comments/1qrmlrk/my_healthy_habits_after_15_years_of_cuti_now/,My healthy habits after 15 years of CUTI (now massively reduced),"After 15 years of regular infections and outbreaks, starting off with every 2-3 weeks or so, I'm finally down to maybe 1 a year or less. I'm currently at a full year without infection/symptoms and still going strong.

I'm not going to go into details about my medical history or what I believe does or does not work as far as medications and prescriptions go, because that's not really my place, and I don't want to mislead or misguide in an area that is already so convoluted. I will however say that I take a post-coital dose of teva-cephalexin, which may or may not be tied to how well this routine has worked, but I cannot say for sure. Post-coital dosages have never worked for me in the past, so I'm reluctant to advocate for it. Just wanted to be transparent about my exact routine. Its currently what I'm taking. I take it about 1-2 days after intercourse, as thats when symptoms would usually start to occur if I was going to get them.

I've spent about 15 years figuring out what does and does not help for me personally as far as lifestyle habits/diet/routines go. These might not work for everyone, obviously, but if there's something you haven't tried in this list, I really recommend giving them a go. All of these are inexpensive and things I swear by at this point. Some are large lifestyle adjustments, others are just small things.

* Water. I know, I know, but seriously. I've been told this all my life and would always roll my eyes, but its a hard fact. Staying hydrated at all times is imperative to avoiding UTI's. I don't over-hydrate, I'm not one of those people who carry massive water bottles around, but I am VERY conscious of when I'm starting to feel dehydrated in any way. Alcohol is also dehydrating, so I don't allow myself to go very long without water when having a night out, even if I dont FEEL thirsty.
* Avoid synthetics or compressive clothing around genitals. This is an absolute gamechanger for me. This was something I only started implementing in the last 6 months. I exclusively wear natural fibers and loose garments. Even with my underwear. I try to only ever wear ""loose"" styles (cotton granny panties). Anything ""sexy"" and tight fitting almost always leads to symptoms. I literally sleep in nightdresses because even cotton pajama pants can be too much for me.
* I do not pee immediately after sex. This is another gamechanger for me. Often I wouldnt have enough liquid in my bladder to ""flush"" my system after sex. So now I drink 2 large glasses of water afterwards and just let my body tell me when it needs to go, so I can pee properly.
* Cleanly habits are no joke. I've always been a clean person, but now I take it a step further. We both need to be showered before intercourse. I also shower immediately after, with some VERY mild soap in that region. I get my butt as well, absolutely everything gets scrubbed. I sometimes change my underwear throughout the day, I always shower IMMEDIATELY after any kind of sweaty activity. The secret is to stay clean, cool, and DRY.
* Focus on anti-inflammatory foods and additives. I make these a key component in my diet. Coffee, berries, ginger, green leaves, avocado, fish, etc. Its funny because coffee was always one that doctors suggested I dont drink, but i only ever noticed positive reactions when I drank it. On the other side of this, I try to avoid inflammatory foods (although honestly Im not great at it).
* Avoid friction or compression with your own body. This is tied to the clothing point, but I need to expand even more. Having my legs pressed together for prolonged periods of time almost always leads to risk. I'm talking about long plane journeys where you're forced to be sat with your thighs pressed together for 4+ hours. Or sleeping in stuffy blankets with your legs tight together. It has helped enormously that I try to get air between my legs, have one knee raised, move around, readjust, whatever it takes just to avoid long periods with compression and heat.
* I do not go the gym or exercise in any significant way for a minimum of 3 days after intercourse. Due to the cleanliness/friction/dehydration points mentioned above, exercise is a huge risk for me until the threat of UTI is passed.
* I do not have intercourse, even without a UTI, more than once a week. Sometimes once every 2 weeks. I do believe that sex is an abrasive act and considering it is the PRIMARY way I contract UTIs, I refuse to fall for misogynistic narratives that partners should be having extremely regular sex to stay happy. I'm not 21 anymore, I don't have to put my body through that, and my husband gets it. I give my body the good grace to heal and recover after sex fully before doing it again. This also gives me the space to enjoy exercise/alcohol/swimming, etc.
* If I'm not enjoying sex, I stop. This doesn't happen often because, again, my husband gets it and knows what to do. But if I'm not aroused enough, or if things are happening at a bad angle, I don't ""suffer through it"" like I might used to do, I stop it and readjust or end things entirely. Issues like this lead to more damage/abrasions/etc.
* I carry UTI and PH strips with me for peace of mind. This obviously has no impact on my health, but sometimes if I feel an oncoming infection I will panic and make things 3x worse. Ive taken these tests in the past, confirmed I (probably) wasn't infected, and brought my blood pressure down enough for the symptoms to be relieved before I started knocking back antibiotics.

I hope some of these help those that suffer from recurring infections or recurring symptoms. There's certain things I havent listed, like herbal remedies or supplements because honestly Ive never noticed a difference personally... that could just be me. Some of these do just feel like common sense but I really just wanted to emphasize the effectiveness of them from the perspective of someone thats seen somewhere between 40-70 doctors in her life and has tried almost everything.",7,1769817803.0,CUTI,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

Thanks to everyone who shared this week, whether it was a quick tip, a longer story, or just chiming in on someone else’s thread. A lot of the conversations circled around everyday stuff we all deal with: eating past fullness, finding a time to move, and how small changes in our environment can quietly shape our habits.

Nothing here is about doing things perfectly. It’s about noticing what’s working, what isn’t, and being honest about it. If you’ve been reading along but haven’t posted yet, feel free to jump in. A simple question or small observation can end up helping more people than you think. What’s one small thing you noticed this week that helped, or got in the way ,of your routine?

# Top Posts & Highlights

***Do you listen to fullness cues? How have you managed overeating?***

u/omg_its_david  
Eat to 80% have a glass of water after and that's it.

u/thaProhet  
glass of water before the meal, smaller portions, one plate limit, regular mealtimes, reduce bread, choosing takeout food with vegetables like soup or stir fry, fiber, oats, daily exercise.

u/AintshitAngel  
I just eat smaller portions and use a small plate.  
My parents reiterated, “your stomach is the size of a fist” to me growing up and it stuck.

u/Whiteshovel66  
My solution has just been fasting. I like food too much and the feeling of being full too much. If I ate three meals a day like that I would be in serious trouble and I was for many years. Now one meal a day allows me to eat to fullness and not end up with too many calories for the day.

u/Sea-Witch-77  
I hate feeling overfull. Also watched my husband overeat when he wasn't actually enjoying the food, his parents just trained him into finishing the plate no matter what. I managed to train him out of it, but he still overeats when enjoying it.

***What did no one teach you about money that you had to learn on your own?***

u/ThePartyLeader  
Life isn't about cash but it is about capital. As soon as I had assets I could use for collateral to get loans finance actually began to make sense.  
Until then its basically like trying to fill up a bucket with a strainer.

u/chargers949  
Life insurance. Pay into a policy and you can borrow against the money you paid in.

u/ghoulypop  
Everything. My brother learned money from the businesses classes he took and I’m 32 and just now learning how to budget.

u/Remarkable-Sweet7141  
Compound interest is magic, you.

u/Jotacon8  
Investing (how to invest in general, types of account to open, etc.), credit card interest rules (and how to avoid interest), budgeting.

u/classless_classic  
The most important financial decision you will make is who you marry.

***What time of the day do you go for a run?***

u/Logical_Strain_6165  
Caffeine mostly. It's pretty cheap. Set the alarm, wake up, neck a pint of water with some caffeine pills. Spend 15 mins stretching whilst I loosen up and the caffeine kicks in.  
If I'm doing a longer one I might replace the water with a sports drink mix.

u/The-original-spuggy  
I run 5 days a week in the mornings and usually the first 2 miles are awful. The rest is fine when I'm warm

u/NPC261939  
Out the door by 4:40. Fueled by oatmeal, and two cups of coffee.

u/Content_Preference_3  
Used to prefer gym workouts between 7-10 am during my energy window but I’ve adjusted with my current job and do some of my workouts after 7pm as well. Don’t love it but it’s doable. Running is similar but since it’s outdoors the early am stuff is a lot harder to get out for. I’ll walk at 6am though.

u/Schmancer  
I wake up at 5 and exercise every day. Have you tried drinking plenty of water, going to bed at a reasonable time (without screens), eating fruits and vegetables, and limiting or eliminating alcohol and nicotine intake? It’s surprisingly easy to improve energy and overall health with these steps.

***What’s one small environmental tweak that had an outsized impact on your routine?***

u/MixFederal5432  
Minimalist deskspace with no clutter and no phone during work hours.  
On the digital topic, using app blocking software during productivity hours.

u/AxelVores  
I set up my router so that it blocks internet after 10pm. Now I have no choice but to go to bed early.

u/littlebunnydoot  
An electric blanket on my desk chair. I’m drawn to it like a moth to a flame.

u/ymaldor  
I moved to a place where biking to work is the only logical thing to do. Biking was 20min, public transport 50-60min, car 35min. Now biking became such a routine I can move anywhere I'll still bike to work and it makes my daily sport.",1,1769817714.0,TrueGrit,0,1.0,False

My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more.

I would like to get married eventually. I would like to have kids. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement.

As for my appearance I am 5'6, 171 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.

I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. All 3 of them not just 2. Also I am interested in having children, this is a requirement. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me. Also please don’t expect me to work from home. I much prefer working at a workplace rather than staying at home all day. I am looking for guys aged 18-28. I am looking for white guys, light skinned Hispanics, and light skinned Asians. Please do not message me if you are over the age of 28. I am seeking a long term relationship.",0,1769817697.0,IntrovertDating,7,0.4,False

1qrmjpz,https://i.redd.it/ygsfb2htekgg1.gif,Finished my largest Fanfic!!! Gif may be relevant.,"First of all, the gif: Used the discord Niko bot for the textbox and the Tiktok video I got from Youtube (I don't have Tiktok so I cannot confirm if that is the OG).

  
I finished writing my Oneshot fanfic that ended up being 32,968 words, so here it is. The gif may or may not (exactly) happen in the story, I wont say ;)  I had a burst of creativity, time and energy and this is the fruit of my labour. 

[The messiah in a saved world.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/75179116) 32,968 words, Summary: (pre-solstice): Niko returned the sun, now what?



Here is some of my older fics, in the order I made them:

1. [A pot of coffee](https://archiveofourown.org/works/74005506). Words: 1,419, Summary: Kip and Plight meet at Lings café.

Note: My first Fic, you might have seen me post it on r/oneshot.



2. [While (Entity) and (not Niko):](https://archiveofourown.org/works/74768586) Words: 3,413, Summary: The player is replying Niko's story, with the help of The Entity, who has it's own thoughts.

Note: This was actually inspired by one of u/[KhaMIMo](https://www.reddit.com/user/KhaMIMo/)'s art, you will see which one at the end :)



3. [I meet Niko!](https://archiveofourown.org/works/76213131) Words: 2,946, Summary: Hey Niko, Proto. This one!

Note: Make this between the chapters of [The messiah in a saved world.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/75179116) It was more of an experiment but turned out decent.

1qrmj8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1qrmj8n/should_i_resign_how_to_talk_to_close_family/,Should I resign? How to talk to close family?,"Hey guys,

I know ultimately it's my decision and you gotta do what's best for your situation, but I'm wondering what your thoughts and experiences are on becoming inactive indefinitely versus officially leaving the church?

Context: (sorry its a lot but i think its important)  
I'm an adult in my 20s trying to get into grad school. My immediate family is all TBM. I'm oldest of my siblings and have gradually had questions and doubts and decided I was gonna face them head-on objectively not trying to prove or disprove just use reason, and I no longer believe the church is the ""one true church."" its a church, does a lot of good and bad. id say im agnostic/deist? idk im a science person so its fascinating conjecturing about what may or may not exist outside of the universe from a physics perspective but ""maybe i dont know and maybe thats ok"", theres no way to know for right now and if we learn itll be after we die or when science advances but honestly i go back and forth no idea if theres a god haha. but anyway i still wanna be a ""good person"" which you can totally do in any walk of life, and i also wanna find myself and identity and purpose beyond mormonism.

Part of what i would imagine helps with that is officially stepping away even tho it would suck with family. thankfully parents have said they love and support me no matter what im very thankful and lucky and i know thats true in the end even tho at first there will likely be pushback or rude things said from a place of love just like when i told my parents that i dont know that i believe anymore. I tried going to church with family but just not for me to pretend lmao, i dont find it fulfilling or connecting really i just feel self-suppressing what i wanna say when people are talking about stuff i know more about that makes it not true. most significantly, im not sure when or how but i imagine in future therell come a time when parents or siblings will ask me questions and im not sure how to navigate that? the way i see it its not my place to deconvert anyone but if they wanna understand where im at ill be honest and go as far with them as they wanna go. but my parents have mentioned a couple times hoping that this year ill be able to ""regain/strengthen my testimony"" but i dont think they get that theres no going back really i cant unsee. i feel like leaving might have the benefits of not feeling internal or external pressure to conform anymore...

another thing is im about to leave a church school and move back home for a bit before med school and idk whether to continue going to church with my family or not? its weird bc idk if ill have a gap year or not, and also ive started drinking coffee bc its healthy haha ive studied it but ive got a sibling on a mission and another one at home whos a teen so i dont wanna step on my parents toes and not tryna influence him if you know what i mean...its just so damn hard bc everyone on the outside of mormonism who was once inside knows where their loved ones are coming from but you dont get deconstruction unless youve been through some form of it yourself. im just trying to navigate the future and live authentically but be confident and still close with family and friends while respectful of them which i think i can do. its also awkward and weird because im somewhat recently divorced (for various reasons the church wasnt the main one but put strain and showed ex's true colors) and im trying to get into social life and just casual dating and idk how to navigate that, i still think monogamy is for me and dont personally wanna sleep around but wanna consider how the future of sex and dating looks in a committed relationship postmo and dating nonmembers (im open to members too but thats just gonna be freakin complicated long term not saying mixed faith isnt possible just difficult in lds context).

So is it worth it to just step away or resign? how to navigate family and friends who im super close with (so hard to fight the urge to just share everything and so ironic bc i never felt that ""missionary"" urge even when i was 100% in the same way i feel the ""anti-missionary"" urge now lmao)? also i love studying the fascinating real mormonism and idk maybe i wanna do some kind of sharing what i learn with people online but dont wanna be rude to the good people in the church but im just being honest ya know? and how do i navigate dating? wish there was a postmo dating app haha but then idk if trauma bonding gets in the way or if mutual understanding would be actually better

EDIT: I know that they dont actually remove all your info unfortunately which sucks i wish there was a way to make them erase my data entirely im not coming back haha",2,1769817643.0,exmormon,7,0.75,False

Due to my room configuration I can only get a soundbar + subwoofer, cannot use any other satellite speaker and the soundbar must be under 110cm to fit on my coffee table. I also want bluetooth to play music on it.
I also want compatibility with DTS X, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby True HD....
My room is about 22m².

I went to a store to try some of them out but wasnt able to try them on actual vidéo content with DTS or any other stuff i need, they were only available at test with bluetooth. I know it's not optimal to try them out

Was looking at :

- JBL Bar 500 MK2 : good price (400€), powerful but too much bass not enough mid (on bluetooth music) and no upfiring speaker so only virtual dts x and other 

- LG S77TY : good price (350€), less powerful but seems enough for the room, seemed well balanced, with upfiring speaker and dedicated mid speaker for the voice, good size

- Samsung Q810F : a bit too long, the sound seemed metalic on the mid and treble and very low on bass even though the bass level was at maximum (on bluetooth music still). And a bit more pricey (500€). Not convinced by the test

- Sony Bravia Theatre Bar 6 : wasnt able to test it, but seems good too, upfiring speaker, 350€, but less speakers overall.

I met a guy on bandmix and we had connected seven years ago or so. He kept writing to me about all the recording we could have done by now etc. we had intricate conversations through messenger and he wouldn’t leave me alone. He was definitely talking too much too.

we finally met- I drove almost an hour to his house. We recorded some material but I was nervous. I think I sounded pretty good. He said that he would send the recording but then suddenly said his software had to update.

I took it as a bad sign of course. That’s when he kind of stopped talking to me, and I’ve messaged him and he is almost rude or abusive now or just weird Like I’m bothering him. Last time I talked to him, he went on about how he was going to Walmart to get coffee. I was like are u talking to me or was that message meant for someone else?? He said he’d send the recording and acts like it’s a bother to just edit it and send it to me. He’s in his 50s and talked about how serious he was.

now he’s just acting like a psycho douche or something. i don’t know what is wrong with him but im wondering if he’s just a weirdo or what is going on.",1,1769817521.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Michele sauntered into her dorm room, letting her backpack slide off her shoulder with a soft thump beside her desk. She flopped face-first onto her bed, arms splayed, and let out a long, dreamy sigh that stretched into a grin she couldn’t quite contain.

The room was small but cozy—twin beds pushed against opposite walls, matching desks cluttered with textbooks and half-finished notes, closets stuffed with hoodies and scarves, and chests of drawers topped with framed photos and tangled string lights. Late-afternoon sun streamed through the window, catching the gray walls and turning them almost silver, bathing everything in a warm, golden glow.

Katie Harris—her roommate and a brilliant student herself—sat cross-legged on her own bed, meticulously painting her toenails a deep plum. She glanced up, brush paused mid-stroke, and smirked.

“What are you daydreaming about over there, Michele?” she asked. “Let me guess—you’re standing on a podium at Columbia accepting the Pulitzer.”

Michele rolled onto her back, folding her arms behind her head, the smile still firmly in place. “Nothing so ambitious, Katie girl. You know that guy I told you about? The one behind the counter at Gus’s Diner?”

Katie’s eyebrows shot up. “Johnny the Italian Stallion? Don’t tell me—”

“Stop looking at me like that,” Michele laughed, her cheeks already warm. “We exchanged numbers. We’re getting Chinese food Friday night.”

Katie capped the polish bottle and leaned forward, eyes glittering with mischief. “Is Johnny going to be your boyfriend?”

“Who said anything about boyfriend?” Michele sat up, hugging a pillow to her chest. “He’s sweet. I like talking to him. We’ve got a lot in common. It’s cute that he fancies himself a writer—at least part-time.”

They dissolved into giggles.

“He’s not exactly boyfriend material,” Michele went on, teasing but honest. “Can you imagine me taking him home to meet the judge? ‘Hi, Dad, this is Johnny. He makes an incredible corn muffin.’ I’d be written out of the will before dessert.”

“So then why the dreamy grin?” Katie pressed, waving the polish brush like a tiny wand. “Does he make you think about the aroma of fresh-brewed coffee?”

“Hey, don’t knock fresh-brewed coffee,” Michele shot back, grinning wider. “He’s gorgeous, Katie. And I’m way too committed to my grades to get tangled up in a full-blown relationship. But friends with benefits with a hunk like that?” She shrugged. “A woman doesn’t live by academics alone.”

“You’re terrible,” Katie said, laughing harder. “You know that, right?”

“I don’t think so,” Michele replied, mock-serious. “We’re both adults. And you should see how he lights up when I walk in. Trust me—it’ll make his night.”

Katie tilted her head. “What if he—well—falls in love with you?”

“Not happening,” Michele said firmly. “I’ll lay it out upfront. The second the waiter drops the fried noodles, duck sauce, and soy sauce: Nothing serious. Casual. As in casual sex. Your call.”

“So I guess you want me to clear out Friday night?”

“If you don’t mind,” Michele said sweetly. “You remember I doubled up with Carol next door while you were hooking up with the point guard last week.”

Katie rolled her eyes, but smiled. “Fair enough. I was planning to spend the weekend with my folks anyway. I’ll head home after my last class.”

“Now that’s a pal.” Michele grabbed her linear algebra textbook and groaned theatrically. “I’ve got to cram for that proofs exam tomorrow. I still don’t understand why I need algebra if I’m going to be an author.”

“Who knows?” Katie said, blowing gently on her toes. “Why do I have to take English if I’m studying to be a doctor? We don’t make the rules.”

“We don’t make the rules,” Michele agreed, flipping open the book. “But I am laying down the law with Johnny on Friday. Between the dumplings and the hook-up, I’m confident he’ll see things my way.”

Katie laughed again, the sound bright and easy in the sunlit room.

Outside, the bells of Harkness Tower chimed the half hour—soft and melodic, like the universe gently reminding them that time was moving forward, whether they were ready or not.

Michele stared at the open textbook without reading a single equation.

2. I bought this solid pine farmhouse table today from the next town over. It was a total steal; most people are selling tables like this for $500+ in our area, which was way more than I wanted to spend. Our old table was a composite table we received for free, so I was very happy to upgrade this!
3. A vintage, hand-painted letter holder I thrifted for $5. It’s hanging next to our sink now.
4. A pear, apple cider, rye and molasses cake I was experimenting with this month. The original recipe was just focusing on pear, rye and molasses, but the apple cider from the local farm added a nice depth to it, and a slightly lighter color.
5. Thrifted $5 magazine rack for my cooking and crafting books. Much needed!
6. The original iteration of the pear, rye, and molasses cake. It’s so good: very heavy with spice and pears and absolutely lovely with a cup of coffee. I have to, unfortunately, be gluten free now, but I’ll still make this for my husband!
7. Vintage mustard vase (?) and the second book of the Emily Wilde series!

8. A cute garden flower skirt and 100% silk pants I thrifted earlier in the winter.

9. $5 in estate sale finds! The robin plate is hanging on our bird wall in the living room.

Has anyone else been doing any thrifting, baking or hobby stuff this winter? In addition to our few thrift adventures, we’ve been watching a lot of DVDs from our collection and my vast thrifted collection of Midsomer Murders cozy mystery dvds, and I’ve been going to the library once a week to read a fat stack of books!

I’d love to see what others are up to! How are you keeping engaged this winter?",15,1769817267.0,cottagecore,0,0.94,False
1qrmcy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatentBarExam/comments/1qrmcy7/a_silent_fist_pump_after_passing_the_patent_bar/,A silent fist pump after passing the patent bar,"I appreciate the advice and support on reddit, so now I'm sharing for what its worth. Today I passed the patent bar on the first try. The monitor buried the lead in text, but I did a silent fist pump before walking out with my ID, locker key, and water bottle.

1. PLI course - I did the PLI course and it was great. Initially I started off with another one, but the exams had IT issues that they couldn't fix. PLI was great and interesting! I listened to the lectures while driving, working out and cleaning the house. Listened to most lectures twice. I did 2/3 of the post course. It helped me structure my studying around key material and frequency of questions per section. Definitely read their materials for each section, did the questions and followed the answers, whether I had been right or wrong. I did read 1200 and 1800 twice, as they recommend.

2. Study questions - These were really helpful to learn material and also get faster at lookup. I had lots of little keywords memorized to find things. Before PLI I was in the high 50s or low 60s. 6 weeks later (earlier this week) on the PLI-AIA-updated 02/03 exams I scored a 76 and 80, doing a full 100 question exam in a single day. Initially it was hard to focus on 10 or 20 questions in a row. Before long you can concentrate much longer. Definitely was helpful to go into the test today, knowing I can do a full 6hr exam at once and pass. I should have done those exams earlier. You forget the details so they are essentially fresh material if you go back in 2 weeks. Overall, I'm sure I did over 800 practice questions.

3. Exam tactics - 

a. If the text is long I start with the call of the question and skim the answers before diving into the details of the scenario. This helps focus me on relevant details and context. 

b. Sometimes you know what they are trying to test as you read the question. If they give a day of the week, it is priority mail or weekend/holiday stuff. Or you see the 2 month rule embedded. Or statutory time vs. not. etc. Or it is a standard pick the effective filing date or patent term end date or 102 or 103. That comes as you get thru the course. It will make a lot of questions easier.

c. Strikeouts: I learned the thing about marking each answer on a paper (1-100, # | A | B| C| D| E| Notes). I even drew that out during the 15min they gave me to read the NDA. But I never used it. If you think about how long it takes to record stuff on the paper in aggregate, it is like 10-15min of your total test time. You will need that 10-15min because of the GUI, (see g below). Instead, you can strike out and flag questions on the software, then return to stuff so that was fine for me. I definitely recommend strikeouts because then your probability of guessing correctly goes up. Also if you return to the question later, you don't start from scratch. Also, mark on the paper for that question where you think you should go next, such as R 1.48b etc etc, so you have a head start.

d. I have always been fast on practice questions, rarely running out of time. For a quick lookup (eg maintainance fee period) it might be 1:30 total, for a standard lookup it might be 2-3min. Instead of skipping a question that requires lookup, I only skip if it seems like I'll have to do multiple lookups in a single question (4or5min+). If I start getting into the weeds, I pull out, select an answer, note on the paper where to go next, flag the question, and move on.

e. I doublecheck the call of the question before moving on. It takes 5-10sec and I saved myself from 2 careless mistakes on the exam. 

f. If there are several difficult questions in a row as you start off, don't panic. I trusted that my exam would get a full spectrum of easy to hard questions. Also there are 10 guinea pig questions which could be the tough ones - who knows. 

g. The lookup software is painful. First, def search the pdf files during your practice work. Get comfortable with it. Try to finish exams more than 10min early. I feel like I lost about 10min (out of 6hrs) based on the slower GUI. You can't do ctrl-f, it is a button. And then to get to the 23rd instance of a search term takes a lot longer because you can't hit or hold down return, it's another button. Then sometimes the pdf starts in the middle instead of the beginning. Also it sometimes is going up instead of down. And the default pdf view doesn't smoothly scroll, so if you change that button after starting your search, it takes you back to page 1. That may not make sense yet, it will be fine, all that to say you may lose about 10min of 6hrs due to the slower GUI. (Load time was fine, only the long ones like 2100, R, L were slow for me.)

h. Look at the answers from the perspective of a test writer. If they say choose the best answer or most correct, then you see that d is c but more, e is d but more, then maybe you want e. Especially if e has a fee in it. Another one is the question style where they have Roman Numeral statements, then you pick the answer that has the right group. So for the Roman Numeral type, look at the answers. If every answer has II, then you don't have to rule it out. On the other hand, if half your remaining answers have III, then work on that. Rule out half the answers at once. 

i. 101 and 103 questions can often be taken directly from case law. So go to 2100 and search for particular terms or phrases. You will often go straight to the case law example. Even if the example details differ from your question, if the question talks about finite options or something, and you find that in the case law, your question is likely to land in the direction of the case law.

j. Definitely hit the bathroom before each session. Especially if you drink coffee. 3hrs is a long time. good luck",5,1769817224.0,PatentBarExam,2,1.0,False

1qrmaj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1qrmaj5/saudi_arabia_solo_trip_report/,Saudi Arabia Solo Trip Report,"There aren’t too many threads on detailed Saudi Arabia itineraries and trip feedback, so I’ll include a lot of things I was curious about and couldn’t find the answers to.  As a whole, the country was one of the friendliest, safest, and most pleasant tourist experiences.

First off, I’m a pretty average looking straight non-religious white guy. FWIW I never witnessed any sort of different treatment of other demographics than I experienced and detail here.

# TDLR;

\* Extremely safe

\* Only behind Singapore and Taiwan from my travels

\* Immigration/Customs were a breeze

\* No religious questionnaires or intensive security checks

\* Wonderfully friendly people who always are curious where you’re from

\* I received many instagrams and numbers of people “if I ever needed anything” and “welcome to your second home”

\* Nothing happens during the day, night time is busy

\* Restaurants are often open until 3am, hotel checkouts are 1-2PM

\* Locals wear plenty of Western attire

\* No need to dress a certain way other than modestly. Some tourists wore shorts but it’s respectful to avoid this.

\* Easily rented car, no IDP

\* Driving doable in smaller towns, probably a no-go in big cities

\* Visa mostly accepted

\* Would carry some cash for gas stations, small shops

\* Moderate English proficiency

\* Most people speak a bit, but few conversations

\* Airbnbs/hotels have relatively few ratings

\* One Airbnb Very clean and professionally ran, no issues.

\* One was absolutely disgusting (more on Riyadh day 1)

\* Hotels were wonderful

\* Not scammy, over touristy like parts of Egypt

\* Fast, low latency internet

\* As a travel foodie, the cuisine was interesting and good, but nothing that I’ll be raving about or craving to come back for

My general itinerary was as follows:

Day 1: Fly in late to Jeddah

Day 2-3: Jeddah

Day 4: Fly to AlUla

Day 5-6: AlUla

Day 7: Fly to Riyadh

Day 8-10: Riyadh

Day 11: Fly home

# Visa process.

As an American, Visa on arrival is possible and they claim it takes less than 30 minutes. In Jeddah airport specifically, they have a comfy looking lounge while you wait. I applied for a Visa directly on the official site: \[[https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/\\ ](https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/)  \\\~6\]([ https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/%5D(https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/)%C2%A0%5C\~6 ](https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/%5D(https://visa.mofa.gov.sa/)%C2%A0%5C~6)) weeks before my trip. 1 week before, it was still stuck on “Send to Embassy” which for me, is the Houston embassy. After calling the Saudi visa department in Saudi Arabia itself, they said to cancel and reapply. So I canceled, and a week later got a refund. I applied instead on \[[https://visa.visitsaudi.com/\\ ](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/)  and\]([ https://visa.visitsaudi.com/%5D(https://visa.visitsaudi.com/)%C2%A0and ](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/%5D(https://visa.visitsaudi.com/)%C2%A0and)) got my visa (and with less questions about travel history) within an hour. Using the official site was a mistake and the website is awful.

# Flight.

I was on Saudia from AMS->JED and it was a lovely experience. I’d say the airline is somewhere above European and slightly below Asian airlines. They have unique Saudi Coffee and were well accommodating. Amenities bag for economy came with nice socks. Before every flight, there’s an Islamic prayer that plays across the infotainment systems. There’s also a prayer schedule that alternates with the flight path. No alcohol, similar to the entire country. 

I’ve seen reports of thorough carry on bag inspection to look for drugs/alcohol. There was none of that. No different than boarding any other flight.

Good entertainment and movies from around the world. One comment mentioned the movies were heavily censored, but I experienced none of that and there were plenty of American movies with various scenes that might not be idealistic in Islamic culture.

The internet situation is the only negative. For the \\\~5 hour flight, you could get free messaging of 5mb, and pay for internet of 100mb for around \\\~50 USD. To be clear, 5 and 100 megabytes TOTAL of data. Once it’s used up, that’s done. So for the free plan, a few texts, notifications, and one swipe on your feed and that’s about it.

I flew with Saudia twice more JED-ALU and ALU-RUH, both pleasant experiences with brand new planes.

# Immigration/Customs.

I’ve read things about religious questionnaire, atheism being considered terrorism, etc. There was none of that on any Visa application. Nothing to fill out once you arrived. Immigration did not ask for Visa, or even ask a single question. (I assume after scanning passport Visa pops right up) Just some finger prints taken and you’re on your way. Couldn’t be an easier immigration process.

Same theme goes for customs. Put your carry on into a scanner, grab your checked bag, walk out the “Nothing to declare” lane and you’re on your way. No questions asked.

# Jeddah.

Public transport doesn’t hardly exist, with the exception of high speed rail to the religious towns of Mecca and Medinah. I used Uber exclusively, although they have local apps. Pricing was relatively cheap. Not quite SEA but $5-10 to go anywhere. My only compliant is that it would often take 10-20 minutes to find a driver although there were plenty around. I watched drivers as I was riding swipe through many potential rides, so maybe they’re just picky. Now maybe selecting Uber black/priority would have changed this, but no big deal.

I stayed right on the Corniche in an Airbnb near the F1 track start. A beautiful view of the Red Sea and close to the wonderful Red Sea Mall. One theme of this trip to note, is how many American brands appear here that I’ve never seen anywhere else. American Eagle, Hollister, Texas Roadhouse, Raising Canes etc.

Jeddah is a very modern, clean, and lovely city. It’s akin to the brand new modern aspects of the nicer SEA cities filling most of the city. I rode around quite a bit and struggled to find many run down parts. In Jeddah and really across what I saw, the roads were in wonderful shape.

One of the few downsides, Jeddah is easily the least walkable city I’ve been at on the globe. Nobody walks anywhere. Crosswalks hardly exist. Trying to walk is doable until you come to an impassable highway. I’ve read folks describing KL as this, but they’re not even in the same ballpark. You can find overpasses and ways to walk in KL, but I was relegated to calling an uber to cross a highway in Jeddah.

One place you CAN walk and that’s nice is the Corniche. It’s a \\\~2 mile walkway on the Red Sea that features coffee shops, restaurants, kids areas, etc. It’s pretty quiet during the day, but at night you can see folks walking at midnight without a care in the world. Women walking together without worry, which speaks volumes to the safety of the city and country as a whole. At the north end of the Corniche, is the Yacht club which has \\\~20 restaurants that are outstanding and it’s a modern lovely area. I did Shisha at Obo beach house, and ate twice at a Saudi cuisine restaurant Merkaz AlNakheel. Now, walking TO the Corniche is a difficult task and will find you walking along side random streets alone. The issue is the F1 track runs between the roads and the Corniche, so there’s only a few places to walk above and cross.

I end up renting a car in AlUla, but locals claim Jeddah is the hardest driving city on earth. During non-peak times, it seems akin to Mexico, Argentina, etc. But during peak times, driving is pretty crazy. I’d put it crazier than Hanoi and the previously mentioned cities, but behind Mumbai and Bali. The advice to not drive in Jeddah is probably a good idea.

As an aside, almost every restaurant and shop I went in took Visa credit. A few local shops and gas stations in AlUla did not. I believe it’s the law that every vendor/shop has to accept digital payment in the form of their national debit card, but this isn’t the case for Visa. Anyways, typical travel advice of taking \\\~$100 USD out from airport ATM on arrival holds. There are no ATM fees in the country I believe. I imagine this is some sort of law. (Your bank may have their own)

Local Hijazi (western region) foods I tried: 

\* Manto - meat dumplings

\* Yaghmush - meat stuffed pastry/hand pie

\* Sobia - juice/tea sort of thing

\* Masoub - a banana based pudding (delicious)

\* Mutabbaq - pan fried folded flat bread. They gave me veggie one which was okay, other varieties are sweet w/ Nutella or w/ meat. I think it would be much better in either other variety

\* Red Sea Najel/Shrimp - more on this later

Old Town (Al-Balad) - So besides wandering around attempting to walk, grazing through malls, an amazing haircut, and admiring the Corniche, going down to old town Al-Balad is a must. I first arrived and had some of the best tasting fish of my life at Ba’eshen Seafood. You walk in, pick out what fish you want from an ice chest of fresh Red Sea fish, they weigh it, and send you upstairs to wait. I had their recommendation of 1 Najel and some shrimp. You duck under some beams and make your way upstairs where there’s one table (it was the smallest seating area I claimed) and the rest is floor seating. Your fish arrives deep fried still on the bones and all. It includes some sauces, mixes of rice, and veggies. No silverware, you eat with your hands and take it right off the bones. Let me tell you, I enjoy fish but much prefer beef, but this was one of the most spectacular meals I’ve had. The natural flavor of the fish and shrimp was incredible along with the deep frying technique. This is tied with my fresh caught Alaskan salmon and halibut (completely different, yes) for all-time favorite fish. There seemed to be a few similar, lesser known fish shops next door with guys trying to wave you in, but they were much less busy. I was the only non-local in there it appeared.

The rest of old town is cool, but much of the same. Windy roads and old buildings, with shops and eateries. Nothing too life-changing but a great use of an afternoon. Like everywhere in the country, there’s not much happening before sunset and gets much busier at night.

All in all, two days seemed about right in Jeddah. You could cram it into one, or stay longer and visit more of the malls and hang out - you can’t go wrong either way.

# AlUla

Took the short flight to AlUla and rented a car with Budget right at the airport. The rental counter is a tiny kiosk in the departures area, which can be easily missed. No IDP was needed, just my USA passport, drivers license and a credit card. They did take a \\\~$500 USD deposit which I thought was quite high. However, I’ve never rented a car outside the US so maybe this is normal. Getting the car was smooth, although the guy inspected the car for \\\~10 minutes noting every little bit of damage. Upon return I was not charged for any damage, so worthwhile.

In general, I was quite nervous to be driving around after hearing how crazy the drivers are. However, I managed fine and not having a car in AlUla is an awful idea unless you have a private driver booked. Similar to Mexico, there’s random speed bumps that sometimes are marked. You always have to be alert for these. All the important road signs had an English translation. There’s frequent speed trap cameras which the locals mostly followed. I’m not sure if they have a tolerance or how they work, but I never saw anyone blast through them.

Lanes are optional, and cars will flash their brights behind you when they want to pass. It’s expected you move over into the median and keep driving. The only truly frightening experience was driving on a two lane road, where one car was in my lane passing another car, and they had no care in the world and fully expected me to move onto the shoulder to avoid a head on collision at 60 mph. Other than that, it wasn’t too difficult to drive and people will gladly drive around you if you’re going too slow for them. It seems most tourists drove cars so I imagine they’re used to it.

Hotels are an interesting thing in AlUla. I stayed at the only reasonably priced hotel I could find \\\~$125USD, Golden Sayf. It’s in the upstairs of a mini strip mall and in an off the beaten path town. Very nice inside and spacious rooms that would easily be double the price in the western world. Could only book through booking dot com. The other options frequently posted are Banyan Tree and others where nightly rate is north of $1k per night, and camping type places. I remote work while traveling so I’m limited to more secure, internet accessible stays.

AlUla is an incredibly beautiful landscape. Driving around is like being on another planet. There’s a plethora of hills, plateaus, massive rocks, and natural wonders. It’s all the same sort of vibes, sand dunes, date trees, coffee shops, historic places etc across the greater AlUla area. They’ve done a remarkable job modernizing tourist sites yet leaving in tact history and nature.

I started off at night in AlUla old town, which features shops and restaurants for quite a few blocks next to some large rock formations. It’s a great spot day or night and visited quite a few times as parking is plentiful (with a short shuttle ride if you don’t feel like walking from parking lot) and is open past midnight.

Next up was the most famous part, Hegra which must be booked as a \\\~2 hour tour for \\\~$25 USD. You’re on a big bus that takes you on 4-5 stops explaining the history behind the region. You walk through magnificent landscapes and learn quite a bit of ancient history. It’s the same group of people who made these tombs and lived her, as Petra in Jordan. Imo, this was a much more neat, relaxed, and beautiful experience than the pyramids in Giza.

I caught a sunset at Harriet Viewpoint which is an observation deck with a little cafe at the very top of a plateau with a magnificent view of AlUla old town. Highly recommended, but wouldn’t say it’s a must do at sunset specifically.

The next day, I visited Shalal cafe tucked behind a mini walking trail in the middle of a large rock formation. It was 10 Riyals to get in, and there’s a cafe and couple small food stands in a very tranquil rock surrounded cafe. There’s a farm next door and you can purchase some fresh fruit as well. I stopped here on the way to a guided tour at the world’s largest mirrored building, Maraya.

Maraya is past a security gate with the luxury resorts Banyan Tree and Our Habitat. Access is limited to those with tickets or reservations I believe. A guided tour was available on Ticketmaster for \\\~10USD and lasted about a half hour. There’s a cafe inside Maraya as well, and after the tour, you could hang out, walk around, do whatever you wanted as you were already “in”. This entire area is situated in a beautiful tranquil valley.

It was quite difficult to find a reasonable coffee shop/area with an outlet and wifi to get some work done across AlUla. I figured with all the beautiful outside nature and sitting areas, there would be places to connect. Although, maybe that’s the idea. Whatever it takes to keep this place preserved and not Bali-like.

Next up, Elephant rock. Tucked away behind a rocky road, a long wooden path brings you to a tranquil day/night viewing area of the elephant shaped rock with SALT burger truck, coffee shop, and hookah stand with ample relaxing seating areas. There appears to be sand dune drifting area behind it which looked like a fantastic time.

Finally, I stumbled upon Daimumah which is a sort of nature preserve explaining land usage and farming practices of the region. It has 3 coffee shops, some snack shops, mini amphitheater, goat/chicken pens, and lots of plans/trees with their significance documented. I went around 4pm on a Sunday, and was the only person there besides the workers. It cost 10 Riyals to get in, and easily can fill up 30-40 minutes of slowly walking around. A pleasant find, but certainly not a must do.

All in all, AlUla area should not be skipped on a Saudi trip, and will definitely be on my list of places to frequent for a relaxing getaway in the coming years. Again, 2 days seemed about right for a relaxed time. There was more to see and tours to be taken, but it’s more of the same. Rocks, nature, history, desert etc. You could easily spend a week relaxing and exploring here, or cram it into a day and not feel like you’re missing too much.

The only other hang up is returning the rental car with Budget. When retuning the car, one must drop off the paperwork inside the airport at the desk. There’s one line for both returning and renting. There were maybe 5 parties ahead of me, mostly all renting, and it took an hour before I could finalize the rental return.

# Riyadh

Airport/Metro is marvelous and hooks up to their relatively new metro. The metro stations were the most modern, clean grand, and new I’ve seen. It is cheap and separated into three classes. First, family, and single. First for 3 days was \\\~$12 unlimited rides. There were rarely anyone checking classes, although there are fines for being in the wrong class, but I’m not sure how many people stick to their class. During off peak hours, the metro is peaceful and up there with the best of the world. During rush hour in the afternoons, it’s incredibly hectic with folks shoving and pushing and no room to board even in first class. Avoiding traveling at this time and you will consider it one of the best metro’s you’ve been on. I booked it through their app Darb, and had no issues. Occasionally when scanning the QR code it would say “pass used”, but after closing and reopening the app all was well.

My time started off with an Airbnb booked in Al Murooj area. I got burned for being cheap the first time during my travels. This Airbnb had not been entered in probably months. Hair and dirt all of the bed, chairs, and floor and I bolted out of there. Luckily Airbnb was cool and I got a full refund. I would however recommend this sort of area, closer to KAFD or any metro line in the center. As a last minute booking, I booked the four points Sheraton by the Al Bat’ha station. Hotel was good and serviceable, and the area right next to a metro station. However, that area specific is old Riyadh and relatively run down and far from pretty much everything important. Not dangerous or scary by any means, just not a top area to stay.

Six Flags Qiddiya City. The next day I headed on over to Six Flags. Booking my ticket online was a hassle, as it needed confirmation from an American number but would never send a text. I had to call them via google voice for them to send a payment link, which I think was not needed as the park was pretty much empty. They have a lovely bus from Jeddah Road station that has USB chargers and is clean and comfortable that takes you \\\~45 minutes in the middle of no place to Qiddiya city - a development project with the 6 flags, upcoming water park, upcoming F1 track, hotels, etc. The park is filled with wonderful restaurants themed from different countries from Indian to various American cousins to Local Saudi cuisines and even London fish and chips themed place. Falcons flight is as advertised if not better, a ridiculous experience going 150mph in the middle of the desert in Saudi Arabia. 10/10 recommend. I never waited more than 10 minutes to get on any ride as the park was not crowded on a Tuesday.

The next day I headed up to KAFD, the world’s largest mixed use district that is as modern, perhaps more than Singapore. It’s filled with extravagant coffee shops and restaurants such as Ralphs and several others. Nothing too noteworthy here but the “central” metro station seems to be here and it’s worth a visit day or night.

Next up was Ad Dirah nearby my hotel, a historic castle and mosque with various walkways, shops, restaurants, the usual. It was unfortunately under construction so not much other than a few pictures of outside the castle. Lots of cheap souvenir shops if you’re into that, and quite a few tourist groups who went down here.

Later, I attempted to do two biggest attractions that all recommend - Diriyah and Boulevard World/City. Unfortunately, I was trying to uber and waited 30+ minutes at various points since neither are connected to the metro or bus. Eventually I gave up as I had a few work meetings and grabbed some food at a mix of Saudi + Smoked Meats at Jazzar nearby their largest public university. Great spot to eat and quite packed with locals.

I did stop at what was formerly the world’s largest coffee shop, Almasaa Cafe with a great view of the Kingdom Centre. They have a skywalk at the top you can purchase tickets and some mall type shopping inside as well. It’s a marvelous looking building with fascinating lights at night. The other famous building a few metro stations south of there is Al Faisaliah tower which has a similar ticketed climb up to the top, but I did not make it over there.

One random note is they have a 100% tobacco tax with a minimum, so Shisha throughout the country will be a minimum of 50 Riyals, and often 100 or 200. It is more common in Jeddah than Riyadh but definitely plentiful if that’s your thing.

Finally, I met up with some old college friends to visit the “Edge of the World” that we unfortunately did not make it to. They have various tour busses that go and it’s a marvelous view, however the road is extremely rocky and without a truck is pretty much impossible to get to and visit. So, we had to turn around. BOOK A TOUR TO GO. 

Riyadh is a sprawling spread out city that felt extremely modern through most parts, but has pretty awful traffic and going anywhere around rush hour can be quite a pain. Luckily, most everything is open late into the night so if you’re venturing out past 8pm and have a car/uber/metro, all will be well. Heads up, metro closes around midnight so plan accordingly.

All in all my TLDR sums up the lovely experience I had in Saudi, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an off the radar destination. Will have to go back to Riyadh with a better hotel, and fresh travel stamina.",1,1769817058.0,TravelNoPics,0,0.57,False

When I met my fiancé, he and I hit it off really well and our families know each other well. He was very emotionally attuned, we have many of the same outdoor hobbies and he’d treat me really well often showing up to my work when driving by with a coffee and other various sweet things. He lives an hour and a half away from me and we discussed moving in together as I live with family and he rents. At the beginning, it was various towns we’d try to settle on but as time went on we couldn’t come to decision. He would want his city and I would want mine. We made pros and cons lists and compare but it wouldn’t get anywhere. Eventually, we looked at a house in my city as my job wouldn’t transfer to his city and there wasn’t anything comparable there. We’d do the commute and then we’d get a nanny for the weeks he’s away for work since he works a shift rotation of 7-7 on/off. It wasn’t ideal but it made the most sense since on his off days he’d work every day at the family farm by the city I live in. 

We went to go look at a house. Right before we entered to talk to the realtor, he told me that he thought we should put the house on hold. That he would have to leave his well paying job and become a farmer (which he did part time and made less than fulltime minimum wages). I told him this was not ideal timing, that I couldn’t support him and that him being financially stable was important to me as I am too.  Not much was said for some time. As time went by, we got engaged and that was great but other things krept up. 

We are both huge into outdoors activities. He and I were supposed to get out to hunt together but didn’t see eye to eye on our style of hunting. We’d end up in big fights and since it was our first year together, I learned how lazy he was in taking care of his gear, as well as his pack rat almost hoarding level living style was. I learned that he wants to share a bank account and got mad when I said no I wouldn’t be sharing mine since he moves his personal money to the farm which he thinks is okay and thinks I’m just not realizing his dreams of farming. 

I sat down with him and we had a talk. About how his overworking (7on-7on) was too much. How his cleaning has completely let go and it wasn’t fair I was tasked with being his mom, how not taking care of his hunting stuff was a deal breaker and that he needs to prioritize things or the relationship will fall apart. He agreed and we listed some ways for him to work on things. He’d put his hunting stuff in containers, he’d lock up items that were in outdoor storage, he’d try and have more down time and do his projects as self care, see some friends and do more cleaning at home. 

It’s been three months. He was talking about houses like nothing happened. I told him that I would be looking at apartments for the next upcoming year until we can decide on a concrete plan. In terms of the things he was supposed to take care of, he only partially put away his hunting stuff and made a joke about he has too much to put away. That was a deal breaker for me but I waited to see if maybe he just ran out of time and needed more totes but I looked in the tote he had bought, and it was nearly empty with a couple things thrown in it. Most of it was still laying around. He did do better in cleaning and even helped me to make dinner a few times. He even started a project. But we’ve been fighting like cats and dogs because the little resentments are building up and during a fight a day ago I told him I don’t feel seen and heard. We have a scheduled talk in a couple of weeks. He thinks there is nothing wrong. I love him, but I’m at my wits end. Am I the asshole? ",0,1769816912.0,AITAH,10,0.25,False

# Which roasters would you recommend I check out?

**Important factors** for me:

* **Quality-to-Price Ratio** – happy to spend more than grocery store, but I don't want to break the bank on 'top-shelf' premium beans until I have explored enough to know what I value most.
* **Variety**  – while I'm sure many super funky coffees won't be for me, you never know when you will love something new, so I want to really explore (including funky options). That being said, it would be great to still try some that could realistically become my 'daily driver'.
* **Accessibility / Availability** – I am happy to order online (assuming delivery to US; one-offs or subscriptions are good). Also happy to explore locally in the NJ / NYC area. I'm in northern NJ but just outside of manhattan; Brooklyn/Queens is a bit of a trek, but I go there occasionally.

A couple options that have caught my eye are S&W Craft Roasting (seems like good quality to value), Prodigal subscription box, and a million others that seem amazing but super expensive lol.

**Currently**, I spend \~$15-$16 / 12 oz (340g) of grocery store coffee. Counter Culture is my current go-to, but selection in my immediate area is extremely limited (I'm lucky to find a single light roast or shops with specialty coffee). The only 'interesting' coffee I've had in my area was a Yemeni singe-origin high-altitude sun-dried light roast (found in a local market in DC).

**The gear** I use is:

* Hario Switch
* Kingrinder K6
* A basic Bodum gooseneck electric kettle (Melior I think?) I got for free
* A basic electric gram scale (also got for free lol)

I do a fairly normal pourover (using more or less Tetsu's popular [hybrid recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC8K40kZ_6E)). In the warmer months, I also enjoy a hot-over-ice style Japanese iced coffee, just substituting some hot water with ice.

We have no idea if it's epilepsy or not, but I'm posting here because you guys undoubtedly know a bunch about seizures.

Today, my boyfriend near destroyed my living room by wildly lashing out, destroying several expensive items and then stood up despite my best efforts to keep him seated. He is a large man, I am not a large woman. Immediately after standing up, he fell straight back down, bashing his head off a nearby plastic storage box. Blood fucking everywhere. An ambulance was called and he is okay, the injury to his head was basically worse than it looked and the paramedics said the injury wasn't concerning. 

Still, I'm now terrified. This time it was a plastic box (which I have now moved into my spare bedroom which he doesn't enter into), next time it could be my wooden desk, coffee table or TV unit - all of which would be well capable of causing a much more severe level of injury. I know to move things out of the way of a seizing person if possible, but the desk (alongside my wide PC monitor) is large and I cannot move it alone. It was delivered and put together by two grown men, I am one woman and I'm no weightlifter. The coffee table i could probably move but it would take several minutes as I'd have to drag it out of the room, and it would involve pretty much abandoning him to have a seizure on his own whilst shifting it out. The TV unit I also cannot move, it's too heavy especially with a 49inch TV on top of it, a PS5 and a PS2 (yes, I still have a PS2 lmao) within it. 

In short, I cannot protect him if he's going to be standing up and trying to move around whilst in the middle of a seizure. Is there any way to stop or at least try to prevent him from lashing out and standing up? I tried speaking to him calmly, saying things such as ""no baby, stay seated, no honey, please don't stand up"" in as calm a voice as i could manage. He stood up anyway. The time before this, he kicked me so hard in the hand (I was guarding my torso which his foot was heading towards) that I couldn't use it for a week afterwards, the pain was unreal.

I know this won't go down well with people in this sub, but this has me questioning if I am equipped to handle this. If he were a child or a woman, I feel like I could manage this a lot better. He's a great big hulk of a man though, weighing significantly more than I do and he's got about 5 inches on me height wise too. I cannot protect him as well as saving myself from potential injury due to how hard he lashes out. The destruction to my home is sadly also very concerning, I'm not rich or even well off by any means. Winter especially is always a tough time of year for me, I cannot afford to just replace the things he destroys.

I truly don't know what to do and really need some advice. Short of chaining him down, how do I calm him down and keep him down until he has recovered? ",1,1769816529.0,Epilepsy,2,1.0,False

~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm Lemon (nickname obvi), nice to meet ya. I'm your typical local cottagecore lesbian, cardigans are the g.o.a.t. Speaking of goats I'm a Capricorn, so I'm as loyal as they come, plus I'm hilarious. I have a very niche collection of unhinged memes, and I think each of them are comedy gold.I'm definitely the artsy type, an art nerd if u will. The crafting Gods have me in a chokehold. Also, I love gardening, currently my aloe is making babies like crazy. Currently I am obsessed with this mobile game called Heartopia, you can have pets on there, and I have a dog named Orange juice and a cat named Apple juice . I have four parakeets, and they are my whole world. And I can and will spam pictures of them.

Pros of dating me:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• One of the ways I show my affection is being consistent. So you'll always have a good morning or good night text waiting for you. 

• I've been through years of therapy and i know how to handle conflict. Not to toot my own horn ,but I think I'm pretty emotionally mature.

• I'm autistic and because of that I am very upfront and honest. There is no guesswork if I am mad I will tell you. My intentions are always very clear ,because I will tell you.

• I'm not the insecure type, I'm very confident in myself and in my decisions. 

• I will never expect something from you that I'm not able/ willing to do. Unless it's like opening a jar, because I have the grip strength of a toddler.
 
Cons of dating me:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• I'm autistic, it's a pro and a con honestly. I won't be able to go to loud concerts or loud places in general. So if that's your vibe I'm probably not the one for you. 

• I have a condition called hypermobility/ eds, it's a genetic condition which affects my soft tissues ,it causes dislocations. There's no cure for it, it will never get better. So if you're someone who likes to hike, or things like that I'm probably not the one for you. I do like going on walks though.

• There will be no hanky panky before 6 months of dating. And 6 months is the absolute bare minimum. So assume longer.

• STD tests will be a mandatory non negotiable. Obviously I will get tested too and give you the results.

• I'm chubby.

• I definitely do not prefer texting, I find it very tedious, honestly. All of my friends and family know if you need to get in contact with me just call me. A lot of the times I'm just hyperfocused on whatever project /game I'm working on / playing . And if I don't pick up I'm busy, not because imma mad.

What I'm looking for/ Not looking for:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

• Body type doesn't really matter to me be chubby, skinny, fat idc, I just like women.

• I tend to prefer more Butch/masc looking women. Or someone with a different style than me (ex: goth, alt, decora, etc..)

• Age 20-34 if you are under the age of 20 please don't message me.

• A long term monogamous relationship, with the end goal of marriage. ( I date to marry, ikik very outdated. It's what I prefer, it's a non negotiable ).

• Shared experience is extremely important to me. Due to that I'm Les4Les only. Therefore, I'm only interested in cis and trans lesbian women only. ( ""You're biphobic cuz you only want to date other lesbians"" I've heard it all before go cry about it, I can choose who I date)

• No kids. I'm unsure if I want kids in the future. Even if I did though I don't want bio kids.

• I prefer women on the nerdier side, it's not like a requirement tho.

• No drugs (including weed, vaping, or cigarettes). I don't do any of those and expect my partner not to either.

Date ideas:
~~~~~~~~

• A sketchbook date at a cozy coffee shop.

• A lil thrift date, let's find cute shirts together.

• A picnic in a field of flowers, and I can make u a cute flower crown.

1qrlxo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lexus/comments/1qrlxo4/toyotalexus_apps/,Toyota/Lexus Apps,"Toyota/Lexus Fix your damn App

A bit of a background, I'm a senior Sofware engineer, been in tech for ~12 yrs, worked in startups, including my own to FAANG.

The Toyota app sucks. The design sucks. There is little to no feedback on some important application actions and no one talks about it. So let's see if we can get a Toyota/Lexus rep to answer us.

Own 3 cars, all of them are Toyota/Lexus, an LC500, and IS500 UE and a 25 Rav4Prime.



- There is no feedback for your actions, I press button X I need to know if it failed or passed, WAG A TAIL DAMN IT!
Example: on my Rav4Prime when I want the AC to run, there is a start button in the app and that's all, the start button doesn't turn on the engine btw it just runs the AC. When pressed on this trim there is ZERO feed back on what happened, did it do it? There is also no indicators in the UI either.

- On my IS and LC500s, When I want to remote start, instead of fucking telling me that the vehicle is unlocked, how about LOCK IT AND START THE DAMN THING and not just sending me an ERROR that command could not be completed. A good design would close the doors and start the damn car. You can chain API calls Toyota Engineers, I swear that's a thing.

- The battery charging status on my Rav4 Prime (%) would not get updated while charging, have to close the app, sometimes force update the damn UI to see the status. How about pull the damn thing at least every 30 mins in your UI or when the app Resumes/Starts from background.

Your server latency is ~500ms for every damn API call (NA servers), then another 10 seconds to get the promise filled and get a response from the car, thus when I press something I have to go and pour myself a coffee and sip slowly while it gets back to me failing.

1qrlxl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/1qrlxl8/32f_in_boston_looking_to_make_genuine_friendships/,32F in Boston looking to make genuine friendships & build community,"Hi! I’m a 32-year-old (almost 33) biracial (Black & white) woman living in the Boston area, hoping to connect with people who are also interested in building genuine friendships and a sense of chosen family, not just one-off hangouts.

A little about me:

* I’m very into arts & crafts: I paint a lot and regularly attend arts and crafts classes at various Boston Public Library locations
* I love books (recent reads: The Neighbor Favor, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, and The Deepest Well: Healing the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Adversity)
* Favorite comfort show: Abbott Elementary or Everybody Hates Chris ☺️
* I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes, but also like going out to eat
* I like movies, but I’m very much a “getting back into it” person lol — last December was my first time going to the theater in years, so no expert takes here (last movies watched were The Polar Express and Eternity) 

Personality-wise, I’m kind and bubbly, though I can be a little shy at first and tend to open up gradually. Vulnerability can take me a little time, but I really value consistency, communication, and showing up once a connection is established.

Lifestyle-wise, I don’t drink or smoke and I’m not into party or club scenes. I’m much more drawn to low-key, creative, and conversational hangouts.

I’m hoping to meet kind, emotionally aware people who enjoy creativity, conversation, and building something steady—lunch dates, chats over a cup of hot cocoa (or coffee if you prefer), library classes, walks, museum visits, game nights, movie nights, or just checking in.

I also prefer getting to know people online a bit first before eventually meeting in person, just to let things unfold naturally.

If this resonates, feel free to message me. No pressure, just genuine energy.

If you'd like to be added to the list, simply drop a link to your farm along with the info of what topmost crop and animal you plan to always keep on your farm for visitors, at least for the time being. If you switch something out, please reply to your post so I can edit the post!

For now I'll edit this post but might create a Master list later if enough people opt in. I'll also triple post people/links for now but might make it a sortable table later, possibly on another site like wiki or Google Sheets if so.

1qrlt8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qrlt8f/my_uncle_was_obsessed_with_holes_part_1/,My Uncle was obsessed with Holes (part 1),"Recently my family was contacted by a storage unit company that said my dad was listed as the secondary contact for a unit under my uncle's name. Which was a bit strange, as my uncle had been a missing person for nearly 14 years now. Which apparently the company didn’t know, explaining they hadn’t needed to contact anyone because of an auto-pay system. Meaning they’d been charging a missing persons account for nearly 13 years give or take. However the most recent charge declined earlier this month, and they’d been trying to reach him ever since. 

My father relayed to me with increasing annoyance that apparently if we didn’t come and get his personal junk, we would have to pay a removal fee for the company to do it themselves. With the added note we only had 5 days to figure it out before the lease expired. In even worse news my father couldn’t do it himself, as he needed to leave for a work trip the next morning and wouldn’t be back in time. Meaning I would have to borrow his truck and go empty out the whole unit myself. 

If I was lucky I could get it done in one trip, but I had no idea how large the unit was nor how packed full it would be. Begrudgingly I agreed to help, and knowing I was sacrificing my weekend he sweetened the deal with 100 bucks. 50 of which I blew on a bag of weed, but it was mostly in the effort to recruit a friend or two to help me move my uncle's shit. 

My buddy John was the only one available, but not only was he willing to help for free, he even offered to bring some beer. So maybe moving my uncle's stuff wouldn’t be so bad, so long as I could get it done in time. John showed up to my place around noon, a whole hour later than we planned but he was willing to basically help for free so I couldn’t complain much. 

John making us late wasn’t so bad until we hit weekend traffic, the freeway was so clogged we ended up taking side streets for the latter half. It took us an hour and some change to get there. I was admittedly a bit annoyed, but I left it at just commenting “we need to leave earlier tomorrow to beat this traffic” to which he agreed apologetically. 

On the way I better explained the situation to John between showing off new music we’d found to each other. He asked how much my uncle had paid for a 13 year storage unit, which I admitted I didn’t know. I decided to tell him what I did know about my uncle, which was all second hand information anyways. 

My dads brother was always the weird eccentric uncle who never really came around. He was a surgeon of some kind, dad said he made a lot of money and traveled often. He rarely if ever showed up to family events and when he did, it was always sort of weird. He was always very serious and kind of awkward, I remember being a little scared of him when I was younger. The last time I had seen my uncle was almost two years before he went missing, which was nearly 15 years ago now.

It took a whole week before he was reported missing, and even then it was only because someone reported his abandoned car near a trailhead parking area. They combed the woods around the trails for a while, but after the second week of searching it became clear he wasn’t going to be found. The more I described it to John the more it sounded like an urban legend, so I chuckled as I continued, dropping the seriousness from my voice. 

“Dogs just never caught a scent, they never found a trace of him or any of his stuff, cops thought a bear got him.” I assured John it wasn’t a touchy subject or anything, we had a funeral service for him years back as a symbolic thing, and no one really showed up besides family. In a weird way, sorting through all his old shit would be the closest look into his life I’d ever gotten. John joked we’d probably find a bunch of crazy vintage porn, I doubled down saying “yeah I only asked for your help because moving his auto-milker pro is a two man job”. John starts grinning as he responds “Just don’t spill anything on me, that thing just baking away in a hot storage unit, probably looks like some dried up elephant toothpas-” “okay please spare me” I chuckled while conceding, John had won this round. 

By the time we pulled up to the storage lot the day’s heat was at its peak, making me glad I had brought an ice chest. I fished out the envelope with the key and unit number before tossing the bag of weed into John's lap. He inspected it intently, commenting on its quality and smell, as had become our smoking ritual. I parked my father’s truck in front of the unit and turned to John, “you wanna smoke first and then take a look?” 

Some minutes later we emerged from our shaded spot pleasantly stoned and ready to get started. I fumbled with the key against the rusted lock for a moment before it clicked with a hard turn. I gave the shutter door a hard upward tug but it stuck a half foot above the ground with a loud metal scrape. John and I struggled for a minute against the might of the door, but only managed to get it up another half foot. 

“It sounds like something’s stuck” John said between breaths, he kneeled down to look under the door. “Hold on” I grabbed one of the flashlights from my truck and handed it to him. “Uhh huh, looks like something’s wedged in the like-“ he motioned with his hands as he spoke “where the metal door slides on the frame, there’s a pipe or something”. Kneeling next to him I say “Okay move, I’m gonna try and squeeze underneath and get it open” 

Grabbing the bottom of the door, I dragged myself inside the dark unit, accidentally whacking my head against something in the dark. “Ow fuck” I winced as I sat upright, my legs still mostly sticking outside. “There’s hardly any room to stand in here hold on” I began shifting myself around to make room for my legs, I took the flashlight and found what I’d hit my head on. A wide wooden shelf covered in boxes and dust which was now at my side, carefully I stood, using it as support. 

I didn’t have time to fully take in the sights, instead letting out a small “whoa” as I swept the beam over the room. I refocused on the task as I turned around to face the stuck door, I could see the metal pipe, bent shut at the wedged end. It had a taught rope holding it in place, as if to bar the shutter door from the inside. With a few tugs I was able to free the pipe from the doorframe and John slid it open easily. 

The room was a sight to behold, and to my great dismay, was stacked nearly wall to wall with shit. The small saving grace was that despite how much there was, it seemed semi organized kind of like an overstuffed garage. I noticed everything was covered in a thick layer of dust, so much for my uncle secretly being alive and living in a storage unit. Not that I expected as much, but I had been entertaining the idea ever since the storage company had called us. Chalk it up to an active imagination I guess, but that would’ve been a lot more interesting. 

The air smelled stale and thick with dust and everything we moved seemed to stir more. I could’ve sworn I heard dust was like 80% old skin or something, but I decided not to bring it up to John in case I was right. Instead I dug two old carpenters masks out of the truck and popped open the bed. “Damn there’s a lot of shit in here” John said while opening a box and peering inside. “Oh my god it’s actually porn” he said, turning to me. “What really?” I twisted my head trying to see inside “no not really, but that's what I would sound like if I did find porn in here” 

Even with the wall of items across the unit, I was able to make out some interesting things closer to the back. Including some old ass looking locked chest, like something straight out of a pirate movie. Some sort of medical equipment including a table sat near the back, along with a huge collection of jars against the far wall, some on shelves others in boxes. But we had a ways to go before we could dig out any of the interesting stuff. My dad also said to keep an eye out for anything I wanted to keep, or if I found anything worth selling. 

After a few hours and some cold beer we found some sort of old surgery books, stuff that dated back all the way to the 1800’s. It had some gruesome photos and sketches of dissected bodies. John and I skimmed over it and found some original images of those old operating theatres where students would watch live procedures. It was a little creepy at best but nothing worse than something you'd see in a classroom I figured, still it was worth keeping for resale. 



Then we found another medical book, or at least I thought it was. It was really old and written in latin, which I was able to cleverly devise with the power of my smartphone. Though from the cover I doubted this was the original copy, and the paper was old but not ‘written in latin’ old. The only thing that made the book eye-catching was the annotations, highlighted sections, written notes, and sticky notes pasted between pages. It was practically bursting with annotation and added paper, so much so I almost thought it was a scrapbook before I opened it. 



Again I wish we had more time to get through the book, but I was able to glean that it mentioned some sort of procedure over and over again. Though I'm not sure if it was referring to the same procedure each time, or if the book is just notes on a series of procedures. Either way I guess my uncle was into the history of medicine or something, like how things were done throughout the ages maybe. But I didn't get to investigate it long before I heard a loud crash near John. 



Before I could even turn around, a pungent odor flooded the unventilated room, causing my eyes to water as I covered my mouth. A strong chemical smell like plastic and freshly lit matches was coming from a large plastic bucket that John had accidentally knocked over. We both backed out of the room coughing with our eyes blurry with stinging tears, I pulled my carpenter's mask off and sucked in the afternoon air. “Shit man I hope that's not some deadly chemical vapor we just inhaled or something” I managed before coughing again.



“I'm sorry dude, a box fell over and pushed it off the cabinet” John said finishing off his beer. “It's alright it fell on its own, did you get a look at what was in there though?” I asked “Form- something I don’t know, it was a clear liquid though.” John responded, then sat to catch his breath as he had been closer to the spill than I was. Determined to keep moving, I inhaled deeply and held it, shimmying between a bookshelf and table to get to the spill. I turned the bucket over and through my stinging eyes I read ‘Formalin’, I grabbed the handle and hoisted the now partially full bucket upright. I managed to pop the lid back on before needing to step out for more air, and to look up the contents on my phone. 



Liquid formaldehyde, which firstly wow I didn’t realize it was spelt like that, and secondly I didn’t realize how toxic the stuff was. So the internet says it can put me in a coma or kill me, but that only happens with high level exposure. But I'm also not entirely clear on how much exposure constitutes high level exposure, so I’m a little worried. It seems ‘about a bucket's worth’ was definitely enough to throw a wrench in my plans. But with the sun nearly set and a good 5 hours of dumping trash at a landfill and filling up the truck bed with shit to sort through later, it was time to call it a night. On the way back we used youtube to educate ourselves on how to clean up formaldehyde without dying, which I'm sure would come in handy tomorrow. 



To make up for the traffic on the first day, John showed up early with breakfast; nothing like starting your day with a whole taco bell meal box and a soda at nine in the morning. John was determined to get more done today, but we had to clean up our accidental chemical hazard first. We had barely made it through a quarter of the stuff in the storage unit, but John said he bet we could get through half of what's left. 



We avoided traffic by stopping for cleaning supplies and some fresh carpenters masks for the dust, this time nothing would slow us down. We stepped out into the lot with nothing but a full ice chest, a bluetooth speaker, and a goal. It took some time and moving furniture around, but we managed to clean up all of the formaldehyde. As I was cleaning up the spill, I spotted a low dresser drawer jammed by a thick notebook. It was thoroughly bent up, but inside I found hand drawn sketches and blocks of writing. 



I wasn’t exactly sure who had drawn them, as nothing was signed, but I wondered if it had been my uncle. The further I looked inside the notebook the more I found myself unable to stop flipping, at first I intended to just set it right down. But something caught my eye, an anatomical sketch of a rabbit with a large gaping hole pierced through its torso. I started reading the notes around it, each line stranger than the last.



\-the rabbit remained dead, but I felt I was much closer this time. Though it's much more challenging to translate the procedure to such a small mammal in comparison. Rabbits may be the cheaper option, but their viability is yet to be seen. If testing continues to stagnate it may be time to reconsider looking for a serious seller. Test 13 remains unconscious but stable, it is theoretically possible, but working on a smaller scale is causing unforeseen issues.



Working on a smaller scale, that part stood out to me. Maybe it really was my uncle's journal, but what the hell was he working on with rabbits? I continued deeper, and found extensive notes about the viability of birds. Labeled and hand drawn depictions of similar operations filled the spaces between notes. Each having some sort of large hole put straight through them, as if having been hole-punched. Smoothed edges, a perfect circle shot through them, organs moved aside, bones broken and graphed into different places. It was like the goal was to rearrange the body around a cylindrical hole, and every step seemed as terrible and invasive as one would imagine.



Even with my very basic knowledge of anatomy, the depicted steps in the process required internal and external mutilation, amputation, and surgery that looked nonsensical. What was the purpose of surgically putting a hole through an animal, just to see if they can? The notes have a clinical detachment to them, the steps are described plainly, but among the details I spotted something that stood out. 



\-and it's quite possible that the failure of these operations lies within the subjects instead of with the architect. The answer was right there, the subject needs to be able to survive the ordeal through mental fortitude. The shock is what's killing them, the rabbits, the dogs, the birds, they all lack the ability to forgo such a grievous change and still remain mentally intact. The subject pool needs to change, higher cognitive function is likely the missing element, the creature must want to endure. 



The notebook ended there, filled to the very last space available, but something told me that wasn't the last one I was going to find. I wanted to read through it more intently, but John asked me what I had found and for some reason I lied. “Just some old college notebooks, nothing too fancy” and I tossed it into a take home box before he questioned further. I felt a little guilty, but honestly there was no point airing out my uncle's dirty laundry for John. But I was sure as hell going to show my dad when he got back, I'm sure he’d be just as disturbed as I was.



I had to put it out of my mind for now as John and I dug in our heels to get through the mountain of belongings. We found old clothes, shoes, old coins, and a collection of hats, of which we piled to go through later. As we got closer to the back we dug out the old locked chest, and John asked if I wanted him to crack it open. Honestly I was afraid it was going to be more creepy dissection journal shit, so I lied again needlessly. “I think my dad wanted that chest, I'd rather give it to him still locked” I said without thinking, “yeah that makes sense” John replied, his attention turning to a basketball sized jar in a deep drawer. 



“Dude, give me the light” John grunted while setting the heavy liquid-filled jar on his knee, a thick layer of dust obscuring the contents. He sat facing me with the jar between us and raised the flashlight up to the side of the jar flicking it on. The light silhouetted the outline of some small preserved animal, but as John moved the flashlight I felt my breath catch in my throat. The light was shining straight through a large hole in its midsection, the ridges smooth with medical precision. John spoke first as we both stared on “Dude your uncle has some weird shit” “Tell me about it”.



Unfortunately our luck didn't end there, we found nearly ten more jars of various sizes, all filled with liquid and something dead. Each one with the same hole, their bodies misshapen and covered in scars. I tried to find comfort in the fact that he was a medical professional, and that somehow this was related to some medical study. But I couldn't see how this was benefiting anyone, unless he got some sort of sick pleasure from it. I tried to put those thoughts out of my mind and push on, John seemed like he could care less and I let him lead by example. More music, more beer, more lifting shit into a truck. And things seemed to be going well, until I left John to take a load of junk to the landfill. I was gone only about 20 minutes, but when I turned back into the lot and backed the truck into its spot. I realized I hadn’t spotted John yet, but the storage unit was still wide open. I figured he had wandered to a corner somewhere to piss, and hopped out of the car. 



I called out his name as I stepped out in case he was in ear shot, I gave it a beat before I yelled out again but got nothing. Giving up for now I started toward the open unit to see what John had gotten done while I was gone. But as I stepped around a heavy bookshelf, I spotted John's shoe sticking out from behind a low table. My heart picking up speed, I quickly stepped around the table and saw John sprawled out on the floor, facedown and lying on top of something. “John” I half shouted as I knelt down, grunting as I shifted him on his side. For a terrifying second I thought he was dead, but I could feel he was breathing through his nose. 



I managed to shake him awake, and he looked just as confused as I was. “Do you remember what happened?” I asked as he looked around collecting himself. “Why are we on the ground?” he ignored my question. I helped John to his feet and told him how I'd found him, “I grabbed a book and- then I'm not sure” John stammered as he tried to recall what happened. I looked down and sure enough, I spotted a hardcover book lying on the ground where he had fallen. Scooping it up I flipped it open, to find the center of the book hollowed out, as if someone had cut a perfect hole through each page. The pages were smeared with ink, whatever the book was about before it was impossible to tell now. 



I felt strange looking at it, like how your head feels when you wake up hungover. I stared into its smooth edges, the dark ink made the hole in the book appear to extend endlessly like peering into a pitch black room. My uneasiness grew until I felt a rising nausea in my throat, and I looked away from the book. The feeling persisted for a moment longer, and then I felt I could breathe again. As I snapped out of it I turned to John with concern. “Are you alright now?” , “I’m not sure, I still feel sick but I think I’m okay”. We stepped out of the storage unit together and agreed we could use a water break, and he seemed to feel a bit better after that.



I've never heard of a book making someone pass out before, something about the hole through the pages and the ink. Maybe it was some sort of optical illusion that made you feel sick, but that explanation sounded a lot better in my head. I couldn't quite wrap my brain around it, the only thing I was sure of, was that I wanted to be done for the day. We had been at it for six hours, and looking at the storage unit I figured I could finish what was left by myself in the next couple of days. I asked John if he was ready to call it quits and go get a bite to eat, but he asked if I could just take him home for the night.



The ride back was noticeably quieter than usual, John and I made light small talk and periodically I’d check on how he was feeling again. Before I dropped him off I reminded him to let someone know he passed out today, I was mostly just worried he’d hit his head on the way down. And even though he seemed fine, I wasn’t sure how to tell if he had a concussion or not so better safe than sorry. 



I was so absorbed in thought on the way home that I missed my exit without even noticing. I kept thinking about my uncle, the garage, and the large locked chest wedged in the truck behind me. I considered calling my dad and telling him about what I’d found so far, before remembering he was in a different time zone at the moment. And I couldn’t imagine he would appreciate a paranoid four in the morning call from his adult son while he was trying to sleep. 



Coming home to an empty house fueled the eerie feeling that had followed me back, the silence felt fragile with anticipation. I put a movie on in an effort to distract myself, and scarfed down some cold pizza and beer to ease my anxiety. Slowly my nerves unraveled as I became immersed in the film, until my eyes drooped with exhaustion and I passed out on the couch. 



I woke up sometime later in a short panic, initially confused as to why I wasn’t in bed. I sat up in the living room, my eyes adjusting to the lamp

I had accidentally left on. I groped around for my phone to check the time, “oh great” I groaned seeing it was nearly four in the morning. Sitting up and feeling wide awake, I decided to shower while I debated if I felt like booting up my gaming console. 

But as I stood under the water my mind began to wander back to the events of the last two days. I found myself staring down the drain, watching loose strands of hair being swallowed into the dark pipes. It felt like I could see the book still, the inky darkness of the drain transfixing me. For a moment I felt almost out of body, the water against my skin felt distant and its sounds dulled like I had put on headphones. 

Stepping out of the shower I decided I had to get into that old chest, I needed to know what was in there. Though I prepared for the chance that there wouldn’t be anything weird inside, that maybe the jars and notebooks were the end of my uncle's strange obsession. Hell it was probably just some old valuables, honestly I was hoping it might be full of money. That’s what I was telling myself anyways, I didn’t want to acknowledge that his creepy old shit was actually giving me a thrill. 

It felt like I was the first one to discover something, like some explorer uncovering a tomb. Or maybe I just didn’t want to admit this was probably the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to me by chance. Admittedly it was creepy, really fucking creepy, but at the same time, I wasn’t some superstitious kid who believed in ghosts and curses. I know that at the end of the day, the only thing that’s actually scary to find in the dark, is another person. 

Don’t get me wrong I actually really enjoy horror media and stuff about the supernatural. And I like to play along with the idea of cryptids and hauntings, but when it comes to real life, I’m not going to let myself be afraid that the boogy man might jump out at me. I guess people would call me a skeptic, but I call it being a realist. Sure sometimes my imagination gets the better of me, but everything has an explanation and I was determined to find out what had been my uncles. 

My tangent of thought about how ‘not afraid’ I was ran through my head as I wailed on the chest’s lock in my garage with a hammer. I figured if I could damage the lock enough I could just force the chest open with a crowbar. The lone bulb above me cast a sort of spotlight down on the chest causing my shadow to obscure my view. After every few swings, I had to step back to check my progress in the light. 

By the time I snapped the lock enough to wedge the crowbar in, I had worked up a sufficient sweat. And despite how cold the garage was, I had to shed my sweater sometime during the struggle. I jammed the crowbar in the seam of the lid and began to pull it towards myself. To my surprise the old chest was putting up a fight, but determined to get it open I tried again. This time I firmly planted my feet before the large chest and gripped the crowbar tightly. Using my legs and body weight, I leaned back with the crowbar and heard a creak. I pulled backward inch by inch until I was leaning so far back I was practically limboing in front of the box.

Suddenly the wood gave all at once, and the crowbar that was holding up my entire body was instantly freed. I fell backward hard, my head and back slamming on the concrete floor causing me to see spots. Before I could even react to the pain, a thundering bang echoed through the garage. I felt a gust of air above me and even through the spots in my vision I saw a brief flash of light. 

I propped myself on my elbows, my ears ringing from the bang and my head throbbing from my fall. The first thing I noticed was the smokey odor in the room, causing me to quickly sit up expecting to see a fire. And though I could barely make out some smoke in the air, I couldn’t see anything besides the now open chest. The light from above was swaying on its chord out of my reach, so I took out my phone to use as a flashlight. 

My attention was immediately drawn to a small metal mechanism mounted to the inside of the box. Sitting inside it was a spent shotgun shell facing directly toward the opening at an upward angle. The chest was fucking booby trapped, and judging from the angle it would have hit me right in the stomach had I been standing. 

I stared at the contraption for a moment dumbfounded, before I came to my senses and quickly turned around sweeping my phone light toward the wall behind me. The garage door now had a mangled hole in it a little larger than my fist surrounded by a series of smaller punctures. So much for it being bird shot, no this was clearly a trap meant to maim or kill anyone trying to get inside. 

I stood up despite my aching head and hurried towards the tear in the garage door. I peered through the hole, trying to spot if the pellets had hit anything on the other side. I felt a wave of panic at the thought of someone being hit, but I began to calm down as I realized nothing besides some bushes and a brick wall were on the other side. 

Slowly I turned back toward the chest, and wondered if any more traps laid inside. After the initial shock wore off and I was pretty sure no cops were going to arrive to investigate the shot, I took a moment to weigh my choices. Something inside that chest was worth killing someone over, that's what kept running through my mind. The only reason I wasn’t lying dead on my garage floor right now was pure luck, and to think John and I were going to open it together. 

Part of me wondered if I should be calling some sort of bomb squad, calling my dad, or anyone really. But first I needed to patch the hole in the garage door, the rest I would have to figure out afterward. Unfortunately I was not near as handy as my father, so I settled for thoroughly duck-taping both sides. A temporary fix was better than nothing, so long as it kept the draft out. 

With the garage door dealt with, I turned my attention to the chest once more. It was safer to assume that the rest of the box was trapped as well, I was going to have to be more careful. Truthfully I don’t know if I had some sort of death wish, or maybe the danger made the whole thing feel closer to my fantasy of adventure. Like having nearly died with little to no consequences made the mystery all the more real, I couldn’t walk away now. 

I dawned some thick gloves, a fire poker, and a welders mask with a headlamp stuck over it. I then crouched low next to the side of the box, and began prodding around with the metal poker. I held my breath every time I lifted an item or rolled something over, I sat and poked around the box for almost 20 agonizing minutes. 

Finally satisfied that I had seen between and under every item, I began carefully removing items from the chest and arranging them on the floor. The chest contained a small stack of DVDs labeled with sharpie, a stack of thick notebooks, a key ring with three keys, and several very full envelopes. 

I decided to open the envelopes first, picking the lightest of the three. I tore it open and poured out its contents, my eyes widened at what I’d found. Two passports rubber-banded together smacked the ground, with what looked like ID cards sticking out of them. Flipping them open I initially thought they were just my uncle's outdated travel things, but then I read the names. 

The names were wrong, so were the addresses and the rest of their information as well. And the photos themselves were ambiguous, both of them strongly resembled my uncle. But neither were quite a perfect match either, I could easily mix these up for my father, or even a younger version of my grandfather. What the hell was my uncle doing with two different fake identities, what were these even for? 

I took some pictures with my phone, intending to look up the addresses after I was done here. I moved on to the second envelope and found four stacks of developed photos neatly bound by bands. Each one was labeled, Disk 1, Disk 2, Disk 3, and Disk 4. I glanced over at the stack of dvds, I opened their container and sure enough some of the disks were labeled. 

There must have been 10 DVDs in total, of which only the four were labeled. More numbered really, one through four, I wondered what the others had on them if anything. Carefully I removed the bands from the first stack of photos, each was facedown with writing on the back. 

The first image was of a series of small cages covered in sheets, the surrounding area was all concrete and metal shelves. The back read

“Storing subjects requires constant care, I recommend refreshing subjects every month as longer term captivity begins to have undesired side effects towards mental condition.” 

The second image was a sterile metal surface covered in medical equipment. Syringes, small bottles, and rows of surgical tools. A rubber gloved hand is pointing to the items from the edge of the frame. The back read

“Tools should be maintained and cleaned between every step and operation, every work surface should be sterilized between subjects. Preventing infection should be top priority, furthermore the moment a subject shows signs of rejection or infection they should be terminated.”

The third image depicted some sort of small monkey strapped down to an operating table. The picture was taken from above like an autopsy photo and it was shaved in large square patches. On it’s exposed skin was a series of lines and marks like a guide was being mapped out on its body. The back read

“Having survived the initial testing, the subject is now ready to begin with the first procedures. Ensure your markings match the guide and example given, zero deviation can be made.” 

The fourth image was a gruesome display of the same monkey, it’s chest cavity now wide open. A gloved hand pointed at it’s now partially exposed ribs, several metal braces and clamps lined it’s small body to hold its parts in place and out of the way. The back read

“Internal close up of step five of where the ribs should be cut, in no way is opening the entire cavity necessary and has been done strictly for demonstration and documentation only.” 

I scooped up the items into my arms and headed straight for the dvd player in the living room. I popped in the first disk and sat down, sprawling the first stack of images out over the coffee table. I looked around as if I wasn’t home alone already before hitting play, but I didn’t want anyone walking in on this. The quality and overlay made me think that these must have originally been on vhs tape, meaning someone took the time to burn these onto disks. 

A shaky handed image began, sweeping the camera over the cages from the first photo. The man began talking and I felt a shiver crawl down my spine. It was my uncle's voice, there was no doubt now that this was all his work. It was a fucking instructional video, the first tape was over an hour of footage. He tortures them first, he only uses the animals that survive the torture. 

His theory was that if they could survive the initial trials that the subjects were more likely to survive the procedures. The first 40 minutes was spent demonstrating different methods to ‘test’ them, he would dunk their cages in plastic barrels of water. Over and over bringing them to the brink of drowning, intermittently shocking them with electric prods, before locking them in a cold metal box. He spoke about repeating this process over the course of several hours to produce the best results. 

I felt sick listening to the sounds of the tortured monkeys, their desperate screams and yelps of pain. He discarded the dead with unceremonious disappointment, tossing their cold tortured bodies into trash bags. The ones that survived, he sedated and prepared for surgery, shaving large portions of their bodies and scrubbing them down. 

The surgery itself was as morbid as I imagined, the rest of the video was mainly focused on removing a large portion of the ribs. This I figured was in preparation for the hole he would be cutting through them, I shuddered as I imagined what the other disks would hold. As the video neared its end, it abruptly changed while my uncle was mid sentence. 

The screen was incredibly dark now, it was nothing but a static of black and gray pixels that danced across the display. But faintly I could hear the sounds of slow raspy breathing, I turned up the volume trying to get a better listen. It sounded labored but rhythmic, like they were deep asleep. The silence was interrupted by a shifting sound, like the camera was being moved. Followed by the crunch of something hard grinding against the floor underfoot. 

The breathing changed, a deeper sudden inhale, followed by a faint rattling of chains. A strained voice cut through the silence in a slow whisper “Isaaaaac”, my heart started pounding in response. That’s my name, that’s my fucking name. 

“My eyes” the voice hissed as the chains rattled again. “Removed so I could better see” the whisper sounded inches away from the camera. The illumination from the black screen was the only light I had, and I felt a fear grip me. A paranoia so intense I swiveled my head around the dark room, and quickly reached for my phone. 

I hated how irrational I was being, I felt like I was scaring myself over nothing. I turned back to the dark screen, the breathing having stopped entirely, I started reaching for the remote thinking it was over. Until I heard one last rasp, a harsh half whisper broke the silence. So close to the camera and clear that it sounded like it came from somewhere in the house, “Isaac”.

1qrlsly,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qrlsly/everyones_hyped_on_skills_but_claude_code_plugins/,Everyone's Hyped on Skills - But Claude Code Plugins take it further (6 Examples That Prove It),"Skills are great. But **plugins** are another level.

**Why plugins are powerful:**

**1. Components work together.** A plugin can wire skills + MCP + hooks + agents so they reference each other. One install, everything connected.

**2. Dedicated repos meant for distribution.** Proper versioning, documentation, and issue tracking. Authors maintain and improve them over time.

**3. Built-in plugin management.** Claude Code handles everything:

`/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code # Add a marketplace`

`/plugin install superpowers@marketplace-name # Install a plugin`

`/plugin # Open plugin manager (browse, install, manage, update)`

Here are 6 plugins that show why this matters.

# 1. Claude-Mem - Persistent Memory Across Sessions

[https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)

**Problem:** Claude forgets everything when you start a new session. You waste time re-explaining your codebase, preferences, and context every single time.

**Solution:** [Claude-Mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) automatically captures everything Claude does, compresses it with AI, and injects relevant context into future sessions.

**How it works:**

1. Hooks capture events at session start, prompt submit, tool use, and session end
2. Observations get compressed and stored in SQLite with vector embeddings (Chroma)
3. When you start a new session, relevant context is automatically retrieved
4. MCP tools use progressive disclosure - search returns IDs first (\~50 tokens), then fetch full details only for what's relevant (saves 10x tokens)

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Hooks|Lifecycle capture at 5 key points|
|MCP tools|4 search tools with progressive disclosure|
|Skills|Natural language memory search|
|Worker service|Web dashboard to browse your memory|
|Database|SQLite + Chroma for hybrid search|

**Privacy built-in:** Wrap anything in `<private>` tags to exclude from storage.

# 2. Repomix - AI-Friendly Codebase

[https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix)

**Problem:** You want Claude to understand your entire codebase, but it's too large to paste. Context limits force you to manually select files, losing the big picture.

**Solution:** [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) packs your entire repository into a single, AI-optimized file with intelligent compression.

**How it works:**

1. Scans your repository respecting `.gitignore`
2. Uses Tree-sitter to extract essential code elements
3. Outputs in XML (best for AI), Markdown, or JSON
4. Estimates token count so you know if it fits
5. Secretlint integration prevents accidentally including API keys

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|repomix-mcp|Core packing MCP server|
|repomix-commands|`/repomix` slash commands|
|repomix-explorer|AI-powered codebase analysis|

Three plugins designed as one ecosystem. No manual JSON config.

# 3. Superpowers - Complete Development Workflow

[https://github.com/obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)

**Problem:** AI agents just jump into writing code. No understanding of what you actually want, no plan, no tests. You end up babysitting or fixing broken code.

**Solution:** [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is a complete software development workflow built on composable skills that trigger automatically.

**How it works:**

1. **Conversation first** \- When you start building something, it doesn't jump into code. It asks what you're really trying to do.
2. **Digestible specs** \- Once it understands, it shows you the spec in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. You sign off on the design.
3. **Implementation plan** \- Creates a plan ""clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow."" Emphasizes true RED-GREEN TDD, YAGNI, and DRY.
4. **Subagent-driven development** \- When you say ""go"", it launches subagents to work through each task, inspecting and reviewing their work, continuing forward autonomously.

**The result:** Claude can work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Skills|Composable skills that trigger automatically|
|Agents|Subagent-driven development process|
|Commands|Workflow controls|
|Hooks|Auto-trigger skills based on context|
|Initial instructions|Makes sure agent uses the skills|

# 4. Compound Engineering - Knowledge That Compounds

[https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)

**Problem:** Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Each feature makes the next one harder. Codebases become unmaintainable.

**Solution:** [Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) inverts this - each unit of work makes subsequent units easier.

**How it works:**

The plugin implements a cyclical workflow:

`/workflows:plan → /workflows:work → /workflows:review → /workflows:compound ↓ (learnings feed back into better plans)`

Each `/workflows:compound` captures what you learned. Next time you `/workflows:plan`, that knowledge improves the plan.

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Skills|Plan, work, review, compound - each references the others|
|Agents|Multi-agent review system (different perspectives)|
|MCP|Integration with external tools|
|CLI|Cross-platform deploy (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex)|

# 5. CallMe - Claude Calls You on the Phone

[https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me](https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me)

**Problem:** You start a long task, go grab coffee, and have no idea when Claude needs input or finishes. You either babysit or come back to a stuck agent.

**Solution:** [CallMe](https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me) lets Claude literally call you on the phone when it needs you.

**How it works:**

1. Claude decides it needs your input
2. `initiate_call` triggers via MCP
3. Local server creates ngrok tunnel for webhooks
4. Telnyx/Twilio places the call
5. OpenAI handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech
6. You have a real conversation with Claude
7. Your response goes back, work continues

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|MCP server|Handles phone logic locally|
|ngrok tunnel|Auto-created webhook endpoint|
|Phone provider|Telnyx (\~$0.007/min) or Twilio integration|
|OpenAI|Speech-to-text, text-to-speech|
|Skills|Phone input handling|

Four MCP tools: `initiate_call`, `continue_call`, `speak_to_user`, `end_call`

# 6. Plannotator - Human-in-the-Loop Planning

[https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator)

**Problem:** AI plans are take-it-or-leave-it. You either accept blindly (risky) or reject entirely (wasteful). No middle ground for collaborative refinement.

**Solution:** [Plannotator](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator) lets you visually annotate and refine AI plans before execution.

**How it works:**

1. Claude creates a plan
2. Hook triggers - Browser UI opens automatically
3. You annotate visually:
   * ❌ Delete sections
   * ➕ Insert ideas
   * 🔄 Replace parts
   * 💬 Add comments
4. Click approve (or request changes)
5. Structured feedback loops back to Claude
6. Claude refines based on your annotations

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Plugin|Claude Code integration|
|Hooks|Auto-opens UI after planning completes|
|Web UI|Visual annotation interface|
|Feedback loop|Your markup becomes structured agent input|

What reusable pod solutions have you used that worked? We only drink decaf and the and the Nespresso decaf options are very limited.

I purchased a kit where I cut the foil off of an existing pod, washed the pod, filled with coffee, and replaced the foil on top. This works, but the foil is thin and it tears more then it punctures. This makes a mess. See my pictures - the first is original Nespresso Pod and the second is the Reused Pod. 

I’m looking for something that works without the mess. 

Thanks for your experiences/suggestions. ",8,1769815527.0,nespresso,16,0.83,False

Submission:This report from The Hindu is relevant because it highlights how global geopolitical conflicts can influence domestic security threats in large democracies like India. The alleged plot connected to the blast near the Red Fort shows how symbolic civilian and commercial spaces  including international brands  can become targets due to perceived political associations. With the National Investigation Agency now leading the investigation, the case raises broader policy questions about counter-radicalisation, protection of open urban economies, and how states balance civil liberties with security when extremist motivations are tied to transnational issues rather than purely domestic ones.

1qrln6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qrln6s/the_psychology_of_rejection_how_to_short_circuit/,The Psychology of Rejection: How to Short Circuit Your Brain's Wired-In Fear Response,"Here's what nobody tells you: rejection feels like death because evolutionarily, it kind of was. Getting kicked out of your tribe 50,000 years ago meant you'd probably get eaten by a lion. Your amygdala hasn't gotten the memo that modern rejection won't actually kill you; it just thinks Linda from accounting not texting back is a genuine survival threat. Ridiculous, right? But understanding this doesn't make it easier. I spent years researching this—books, neuroscience papers, podcasts with actual psychologists—trying to figure out why smart, capable people, myself included, would rather chew glass than face potential rejection. Turns out it's biology plus some really shitty societal conditioning. The good news? You can rewire this. Not overnight, but definitely. Let me share what actually works.

**The exposure therapy hack that actually doesn't suck**

Most advice tells you to ""just do it,"" which is about as helpful as telling someone with depression to ""cheer up."" What works better is systematic desensitization; basically, you teach your brain that rejection isn't fatal by collecting tiny rejections on purpose. Start stupid small. Ask a barista for a discount you know they won't give. Request a free sample somewhere that doesn't offer them. The author Jia Jiang did this for 100 days and wrote about it in \*\*Rejection Proof\*\*. He's an entrepreneur who realized his fear was killing every opportunity before it started. The book chronicles his experiment of asking strangers for increasingly weird favors, getting rejected constantly, and documenting how his nervous system literally adapted. What makes this insanely good is Jiang breaks down the specific physiological responses, the shame spirals, and how they diminished with repetition. By day 30 he was asking to borrow $100 from strangers. By day 60 his baseline anxiety around asking for things had dropped dramatically. This isn't feel-good fluff; it's documented behavioral exposure therapy wrapped in entertaining stories. Best rejection book I've ever read, hands down.

**Reframe rejection as data collection, not personal failure** 

This comes straight from Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset. When you get rejected, you're not receiving a verdict on your worth as a human; you're getting information. Maybe your approach sucked. Maybe the timing was wrong. Maybe that person is going through some shit. Maybe they're just not your people. The app \*\*Ash\*\* is surprisingly brilliant for this; it's technically a relationship and mental health coach, but the AI actually helps you process rejection in real time without the catastrophizing. You vent about getting turned down for a job or ghosted after a date, and it guides you through rational reframing. Not in a toxic positivity way, but genuinely helping you separate rejection of your ask from rejection of your existence. I've recommended this to friends dealing with dating app burnout and job search spirals; the pattern interrupt it provides is legitimately helpful.

If you want something that connects all these concepts into an actual learning system, there's \*\*BeFreed\*\*, an AI learning app that pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. Founded by Columbia grads and former Google AI experts, it generates tailored podcasts based on what you're struggling with, like building resilience to rejection or handling social anxiety. You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and pick voices that keep you engaged; some people swear by the smoky, conversational tone for heavy topics. It also builds you a structured learning plan that evolves as you progress, addressing your specific fears and goals. Worth checking out if you're serious about rewiring these patterns systematically.

**Understand the spotlight effect is lying to you** 

Research by Thomas Gilovich at Cornell found people massively overestimate how much others notice or remember their social failures. You think everyone at the party witnessed your awkward conversation. In reality, most people were in their own heads worried about their own shit. That embarrassing thing you did last Tuesday that keeps you up at night? Nobody else is thinking about it. I'm serious; they probably forgot it happened by Thursday. This matters because much of rejection fear isn't about the actual rejection; it's about imagined social judgment and humiliation that largely exists only in your head.

**Practice rejection in low-stakes environments constantly**

The podcast \*\*The Tim Ferriss Show\*\* did an episode with Noah Kagan where they discussed ""comfort zone expansion"" exercises. Kagan's approach is basically treating your social anxiety like a muscle. Ask for 10% off your coffee. Lie down in a busy public space for 30 seconds. Request to speak to a manager for no reason and give positive feedback. These feel mortifying at first; your amygdala is screaming. But each micro rejection you survive builds evidence that the fear response is disproportionate. Neurologically, you're literally building new neural pathways that associate rejection with ""mild discomfort"" instead of ""existential threat.""

**Separate your identity from outcomes**

The book \*\*The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck\*\* by Mark Manson gets memed to death, but the core principle is actually profound. Manson argues that when your self-worth is contingent on external validation, you're fucked. He's a blogger turned author who spent years chasing approval metrics, followers, and likes and was miserable despite success. The shift came from anchoring identity to internal values: am I being honest? am I being courageous? am I living according to my principles rather than results. You can get rejected and still respect yourself if your metrics for self-worth aren't dependent on others' responses. The chapter on rejection and relationships will genuinely make you question everything you think you know about why you're scared of hearing no.

Look, your brain is always going to flinch at rejection initially. That's hardware. But the intensity and duration of that fear response? That's absolutely changeable software. The people who seem fearless aren't; they've just proven to their nervous system repeatedly that rejection is survivable, sometimes even valuable. Start collecting tiny nos. Reframe each one as evidence you're actually living instead of hiding. The fear doesn't disappear completely; you just get better at doing the thing anyway.",1,1769815472.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

Aaron's voice quivered. Of course I had experienced it, but I felt an unusual weight on his words. "" Yeah? That shit happens to everyone man."" 

Aaron said "" Every single fucking time i open a door in this place, i forget why i did it."" A short silence came over me. I saod yes to house sitting for him. He thanked me and said hed leave immediately.

""You can eat whatever is in my fridge, basically my house is your house."" Exciting, I was living off of ramen noodles and coffee at that point. Plus Aaron said hed pay me. So I got the bus  to his.

See, Aaron was doing quite well for himself and lived a town over. It was like a travel brochure picket fences and ocean breeze. On the bus I saw a sea of orange leaves and these islands of picture perfect colonial houses.

The bus and i departed leaving me to make my way to the house on foot, dead leaves crackling under my boots. The house was somewhat seperate from the rest of the neighbourhood sequestuered by a decent thicket. A two story home with soft cream paint and an extremely bright jade roofing. I wasnt going to comment on my friends home decor tastes while i lived in a sooty tower block, so i just opened the door and went inside.

I immediately burst up the hardwood stairs in search of the guest bedroom. The house felt deceptively spacious. By no means was it a shack, but it felt like a damn mansion on the inside. I dont know maybe it was just cause i spent the past few years in my cramped one room apartment. 

The place was a palace compared to my hut, no doubts there. Hardwood floors, marble tabletops and cozy warm lights. Man, I was gonna live like a king here- the fridge was fully stocked with cheeses and deli meats and juices of all kinds too.

I looked out the window to see the familiar crimson glow of the sun setting. ""Damn"" I thought to myself,"" i better break out the scotch, sure aaron wouldnt mind."" I strolled to the cellar under the first floor, the room was a cramped labrynth of shelves stuffed with wines whiskeys and other beverages. I grabbed the first scotch i could find, cold to the touch.

I sat in the living room listening to music, sipping from an elegant decanter. So cold it felt like it had been in the rain. The soft warm light from the fireplace cast fuzzy sillouhettes against the wall. It felt like a scene from a book.

Later, the tv cut out. I stood, walked over and pawed blindly for the socket. Nothing. ""For fuck sake"" I shouted internally, ""There goes my night."" I turned to go upstairs. Then i saw the shadows.

Well, more like lack of shadow, my own shadow.  The fireplace was roaring behind me, there was plenty of light. But no shadow of mine, I stared fixated. Little spindles of black cast themselves across the wall, undulating inward and outwards with my breath. 

This silent pantomime played out infront of my eyes. Suddenly my attention was ripped from the wall with a furious screech from right behind me. I nearly snapped my neck turning round. The T.V was alive with sharp white light, a scramble of shreiking static.

I clumsily ripped the plug from its socket, I couldnt stand that noise. My legs bound out of that room, up the stairs and into the guest room. What the hell happened there? After a few minutes of deliberating on leaving I decided that 3 glasses of whiskey was the limit, and wrapped myself into bed.

I awoke to the blaring of my phone alarm in the morning. After hitting it, I just sunk back into my pillow. My brain throbbed and ached so bad that last nights strangeness was just a foggy memory. But I couldnt just let it pacify me. 

After downing a few tall glasses of water I decided to just stay in and just  take stock of everything. Curious and slightly nosy, I opened Aarons bedroom door. The place was relatively unkempt compared to the rest of the home. Books laid haphazardly on his desk, his blanket crumpled by the bedside and a few empty beer cans stood on the floor.

As I examined my friends living quarters, I asked myself a question. 
""Wait"" my mind whispered ""What was I even curious about?"" Surely I hadnt forgotten, the idea was literally on the tip of my tongue. I just shrugged, supposed I may aswell look at what he'd been reading.

His desk was a veritable library of different tastes and interests. French philosophy, New England folk tales and much more. I suppose theyre is a reason he lived in such cushy conditions. Guy had always been bright.

Not being much of a reader myself, I began to exit. And just before my eyes laid a handwritten ""note to self"". ""Stay out of the cellar, not from home, door is too tall."" was scratched into the paper in pencil. Before I could react my pocket buzzed.

""How you getting along, Danny?"" My heart skipped a beat. I tried to ignore the message, I dont know. I just threw the door open and made my way downstairs. I decided to fix myself another drink.

It was 4 pm at that point but- hell what can I say. I just felt like it. I snatched a bottle of bourbon from the top shelf: that'll do me. The bottle pressed into my lips and I let the river wash down my gullet.

My eyes scanned the cellar as i took uet another sip. And I finally saw it. The door almost looked normal, I wouldnt say it was ""too tall"" just... Well it seemed to have aged out of place compared to the rest of the building.

Wood so gnarled it looked like it had been clawed at by a pet longing for release. Faint, yellowed paint peeled from its surface. Stranger still, it was as if dulling out of focus from my vision. Devolving into a hazey, rectangular smudge on the otherwise pristine wall.

My breath drew deeper. There was no mistake to be made. This had to be what Aaron wrote about. My hand slipped into my pocket, I dialed him.

He answered immediately. ""Hey, sorry about not replying, is they're anything you wanna tell me about your-"" Aaron cut in ""Oh yeah, thats just where I keep the good shit. Its got a thousand dollar bottle of scotch, but i dont care. Im clean."" I congratulated him and soon after he just, hung up.

I was frankly glad. The convo seemed off, like I was having a conversation with a robot. Every word had this notion that it was pre-planned. I dont know, my mind feels cloudy and i doubt this cellar does anything to clear it. Overthinking has been a lifelong issue.

Better to just keep myself busy. I set muself the task of keeping the house clean and actually eating for once. My kitchen knife was hacking away at an onion, the pungent fumes stung my eye. 

My eyes faced the window the night sky was staring back at me. Eyeshine in the thousands. The house was still as the grave, the deafening drone of silence filling my skull. Knock-knock.

Immediately I walked to the front door to see who it was. My hand tentatively grasped at its handle- knock-knock. I spun round. It was coming from the cellar...

A cold shock rippled out of my heart, up my spine and flooded my brain. Impossible, not fucking possible they're is no way in all of gods creation that someone was down there. All entrances were sealed shut there was no way. 

Perhaps a window ajar? Aaron never left?  A god damned spirit? I rocketed down the stairs, blade hugging my jeans tight. I ran through the maze and there it was! 

The door. Not the same door I saw earlier, this one looked like someone pasted a glass backdoor onto the cellar wall. Knock-knock knock-knock knock-knock. My phone buzzed as if hundreds of messages were being sent at once. 

Aaron had spammed ""Im clean now"" ad infinitum. I threw my phone and flung the door open. It opened with a wet squelch, a foetid smelling, slightly warm fluid pooled out of it. And that was when my world ended.

It could have been Aaron, at some point.  All that was there was a yellowed husk. Papery skin clinging to bone so tightly you could see every individual rib. Empty cheeks below pallid, dry eyes that still looked as if they could blink. Worst of all, his mouth contorted into a snarl that looked like he transmuted all his lifes pain into a single, ghoulish expression.

A low voice rasped at me, so quiet I wasnt convinced it was real. ""Daniel, the good stuffs all in here."" It was followed with a soft buzz and a flash of blue light from the mummified mans lap.

1qrlgij,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1qrlgij/everyones_hyped_on_skills_but_claude_code_plugins/,Everyone's Hyped on Skills - But Claude Code Plugins take it further (6 Examples That Prove It),"Skills are great. But **plugins** are another level.



**Why plugins are powerful:**

**1. Components work together.** A plugin can wire skills + MCP + hooks + agents so they reference each other. One install, everything connected.

**2. Dedicated repos meant for distribution.** Proper versioning, documentation, and issue tracking. Authors maintain and improve them over time.

**3. Built-in plugin management.** Claude Code handles everything:

`/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code # Add a marketplace`

`/plugin install superpowers@marketplace-name # Install a plugin`

`/plugin # Open plugin manager (browse, install, manage, update)`



Here are 6 plugins that show why this matters.

# 1. Claude-Mem - Persistent Memory Across Sessions

[https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)

**Problem:** Claude forgets everything when you start a new session. You waste time re-explaining your codebase, preferences, and context every single time.

**Solution:** [Claude-Mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) automatically captures everything Claude does, compresses it with AI, and injects relevant context into future sessions.

**How it works:**

1. Hooks capture events at session start, prompt submit, tool use, and session end
2. Observations get compressed and stored in SQLite with vector embeddings (Chroma)
3. When you start a new session, relevant context is automatically retrieved
4. MCP tools use progressive disclosure - search returns IDs first (\~50 tokens), then fetch full details only for what's relevant (saves 10x tokens)

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Hooks|Lifecycle capture at 5 key points|
|MCP tools|4 search tools with progressive disclosure|
|Skills|Natural language memory search|
|Worker service|Web dashboard to browse your memory|
|Database|SQLite + Chroma for hybrid search|

**Privacy built-in:** Wrap anything in `<private>` tags to exclude from storage.



# 2. Repomix - AI-Friendly Codebase

[https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix)

**Problem:** You want Claude to understand your entire codebase, but it's too large to paste. Context limits force you to manually select files, losing the big picture.

**Solution:** [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) packs your entire repository into a single, AI-optimized file with intelligent compression.

**How it works:**

1. Scans your repository respecting `.gitignore`
2. Uses Tree-sitter to extract essential code elements
3. Outputs in XML (best for AI), Markdown, or JSON
4. Estimates token count so you know if it fits
5. Secretlint integration prevents accidentally including API keys

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|repomix-mcp|Core packing MCP server|
|repomix-commands|`/repomix` slash commands|
|repomix-explorer|AI-powered codebase analysis|

Three plugins designed as one ecosystem. No manual JSON config.



# 3. Superpowers - Complete Development Workflow

[https://github.com/obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)

**Problem:** AI agents just jump into writing code. No understanding of what you actually want, no plan, no tests. You end up babysitting or fixing broken code.

**Solution:** [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is a complete software development workflow built on composable skills that trigger automatically.

**How it works:**

1. **Conversation first** \- When you start building something, it doesn't jump into code. It asks what you're really trying to do.
2. **Digestible specs** \- Once it understands, it shows you the spec in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. You sign off on the design.
3. **Implementation plan** \- Creates a plan ""clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow."" Emphasizes true RED-GREEN TDD, YAGNI, and DRY.
4. **Subagent-driven development** \- When you say ""go"", it launches subagents to work through each task, inspecting and reviewing their work, continuing forward autonomously.

**The result:** Claude can work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Skills|Composable skills that trigger automatically|
|Agents|Subagent-driven development process|
|Commands|Workflow controls|
|Hooks|Auto-trigger skills based on context|
|Initial instructions|Makes sure agent uses the skills|



# 4. Compound Engineering - Knowledge That Compounds

[https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)

**Problem:** Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Each feature makes the next one harder. Codebases become unmaintainable.

**Solution:** [Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) inverts this - each unit of work makes subsequent units easier.

**How it works:**

The plugin implements a cyclical workflow:

`/workflows:plan → /workflows:work → /workflows:review → /workflows:compound ↓ (learnings feed back into better plans)`

Each `/workflows:compound` captures what you learned. Next time you `/workflows:plan`, that knowledge improves the plan.

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Skills|Plan, work, review, compound - each references the others|
|Agents|Multi-agent review system (different perspectives)|
|MCP|Integration with external tools|
|CLI|Cross-platform deploy (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex)|



# 5. CallMe - Claude Calls You on the Phone

[https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me](https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me)

**Problem:** You start a long task, go grab coffee, and have no idea when Claude needs input or finishes. You either babysit or come back to a stuck agent.

**Solution:** [CallMe](https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me) lets Claude literally call you on the phone when it needs you.

**How it works:**

1. Claude decides it needs your input
2. `initiate_call` triggers via MCP
3. Local server creates ngrok tunnel for webhooks
4. Telnyx/Twilio places the call
5. OpenAI handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech
6. You have a real conversation with Claude
7. Your response goes back, work continues

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|MCP server|Handles phone logic locally|
|ngrok tunnel|Auto-created webhook endpoint|
|Phone provider|Telnyx (\~$0.007/min) or Twilio integration|
|OpenAI|Speech-to-text, text-to-speech|
|Skills|Phone input handling|

Four MCP tools: `initiate_call`, `continue_call`, `speak_to_user`, `end_call`



# 6. Plannotator - Human-in-the-Loop Planning

**Problem:** AI plans are take-it-or-leave-it. You either accept blindly (risky) or reject entirely (wasteful). No middle ground for collaborative refinement.

**Solution:** [Plannotator](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator) lets you visually annotate and refine AI plans before execution.

**How it works:**

1. Claude creates a plan
2. Hook triggers - Browser UI opens automatically
3. You annotate visually:
   * ❌ Delete sections
   * ➕ Insert ideas
   * 🔄 Replace parts
   * 💬 Add comments
4. Click approve (or request changes)
5. Structured feedback loops back to Claude
6. Claude refines based on your annotations

**What it bundles:**

|Component|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|Plugin|Claude Code integration|
|Hooks|Auto-opens UI after planning completes|
|Web UI|Visual annotation interface|
|Feedback loop|Your markup becomes structured agent input|

I brew light roast coffees with a v60, and a fellow ode 2 grinder. I’ve been using 1/2 diluted TWW for the last year or so, and I’m just interested in exploring some options

I started gaining rapid weight in 2021. I ahve tried every caloric deficit, diet, exercise, exercise intensity, type, intervals etc since 2021. I can't lose weight. Instead, it's like I gain it. I am chronically ill with quite a few illnesses, someone which I am having to fight my docs just to get answers on because I am disabled by these symptoms but they 'can't' do anything since insurance sucks.  

I have had eating disorders my entire life due to unhealthy relationships with food and thinking I was overweight at 14 at 155 when the reality was i was skinny. I was skinny, athletic, 4 sports a year, exercising every day except Wednesday. That was when I was in Highschool though. I still struggle with food relationships due to constantly being told my normal portion size was too muchj, food being literally stolen off my plate. 

I am now finally starting to gain traction in a healthy food relationship at 29. Balancing veggies, fruits, meats, legumes (beans), grains. I have P.O.T.S, which means basically I faint if i do not get enough sodium and my HR can spike suddenly from 85-160 depending on how much I exert myself. I also have a spinal arthritis due to genetics. 

I am trying everything, but I am so tired of hating how I feel and look in the mirror. I don't drink soda or coffee often either. Does anyone have any advice for someone who is petite, has a WFH and office job, with a disibility, and wants to just make steps that can maybe help me finally lose this damn weight? Intermittant fasting is dangerous for me so i cannot do that sadly.",6,1769815006.0,PetiteFitness,10,0.69,False
