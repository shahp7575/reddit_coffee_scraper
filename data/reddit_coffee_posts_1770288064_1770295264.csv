I have a lot of different interests and I am up for almost anything.

I like going to the gym, playing and watching football, playing chess, reading Non-fiction, going on walks, watching anime / k dramas, listening to music anything from playboi carti to the beatles to charli XCX (crazy lineup ik haha), I also am somewhat into politics, not as much nowadays, oh and I love helping others by doing various charity projects.

I also am up to talk about anything and am open to debates as I like hearing other people's views.

I am looking at eventually being irl friends but to start with, lets message each other for a bit and see if we get along well enough first. After that we could get drinks or coffee etc.",1,1770295232.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

“What?” Austin said sharply.

“Nothing, man—just leave me be,” Gerald muttered, pulling out his phone to scroll endlessly.

Austin approached Gerald.

“Let’s get one thing straig—”

Gerald shot up from his phone. “Bruh, you ain’t gotta start that bullshit! You sent Josh out there the other day, he probably froze in a ditch somewhere. For what?! Man was selling a little dope, that make you feel big?”

Austin stood silent for a moment.

“Nothing to say, huh? You know what you did. You’ll have your day.” Gerald laughed, low and bitter.

“Is that a threat?” Austin asked. “Because if it is, that will get you put out real quick.”

Gerald smacked his lips and his eyes widened. “You can’t be serious!?”

“I am. When you threaten me, that compromises the safety of the mission and people here,” Austin replied.

A few guests on nearby bunks glanced over, then quickly away.

From one of the middle bunks, a hoarse voice drifted out.

“Knock it off, Gerald. Some of us are tryin’ to sleep.”

Will lay on his side, blanket pulled to his chin, cane propped against the wall within arm’s reach. His eyes were half-closed, but Austin could feel him listening.

Gerald smacked his lips again, wide-eyed in mock disbelief. Austin couldn’t believe it either. “Man, you really somethin’ else.” He shoved his phone into his pocket, muttering curses under his breath as he trudged toward his bunk.

The other transients slowly prepared their bunks; some didn’t even bother and just lay on an unmade cot, already asleep.

The room slackened, but not by much. Austin moved to the desk. The clipboards sat stacked, neat, waiting—schedules, chores, the list of names. He straightened them, though they didn’t need it. His eyes slid toward the hallway, the one that led to the bathroom.

“Bathroom get cleaned?” His voice carried thinly through the room.

“Yeah, Marcus did it,” someone said, flat from a bunk.

Another voice followed, too quick: “Needs to do it again. Go see for yourself, chaplain.”

Austin glanced up just long enough to see Will roll onto his back, fingers ticking the cane handle—tap, tap, tap—like he was setting the pace.

The sound snagged something in Austin’s chest. Familiar.

Josh used to do that with a lighter—tap,tap, tap—waiting for somebody to to buy. 

Austin nodded once, eyes still on the paper. “Should be fine,” he said, more to himself than anyone.

He started his first headcount. The roster said twenty-three. He pointed the pen and worked across the bunks the way he used to grade tests—left to right, no skipping.

Twenty-two.

A small laugh popped from the far side of the room. Somebody muttered, “Here we go.”

Austin’s ears warmed. He forced the pen back to the top of the page.

“Hold still a second,” he said, trying to make it sound like routine, like he wasn’t about to turn the room into a courtroom.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

“Will—stop,” Austin added, still not looking up.

The tapping didn’t stop. It got steadier, cleaner, like Will wanted him to hear it.

Austin counted again. Slower. 

Twenty-four.

The pen stopped in midair.

He didn’t look up right away. Looking up too fast meant catching eyes—twenty-three pairs, waiting for him to accuse someone, to start the kind of chaos that got men thrown out.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Will’s voice drifted from his bunk, light as a joke. “Counting’s your thing, right, Chaplain?”

Austin kept his face blank. The old him—the math teacher—wanted the problem to behave. Wanted the number to land where it was supposed to land.

He set the clipboard down on the desk like he was choosing not to turn the room upside down. 

A guest stopped making his bed and shuffled over with a strange, deliberate kind of walk. New. Austin hadn’t seen him before.

“Are you the staff watching us here?” the man asked.

“Yes,” he said. “I’m Austin.”

The man hesitated, then stuck a hand out—too far, too eager. “Um… I’m Eddie. Yeah.”

Austin stared at the list a moment too long before he noticed the hand. He dropped the clipboard to his side.

“Sorry. Yeah. Nice to meet you.” He shook Eddie’s hand and looked up.

Eddie’s eyes were wet and puffy, but he wore a crooked grin. Late forties. Tall and a little twisted, like somebody had wrung him out and never quite bothered to straighten him again.

“Yeah…” Eddie said. “I’m glad I got a bed here. Otherwise I don’t know what I might’ve done.” His mouth twitched like he was trying to laugh and couldn’t decide if it was allowed. “Probably just throw myself off the state bridge.”

A short, empty laugh slipped out—then caught, almost turning into something else.

Austin forced his face into something steady. “Well. I’m glad you’re here.”

Eddie kept going too fast, like silence would swallow him. “If you need me to clean or anything, I’ll do it. If I’m not taking a tour of the roof, haha.”

The laugh cut off again, abrupt.

“I appreciate that,” Austin said. “And—look, you’re not doing great. If you want to talk at some point, I’m around.”

“I got a shrink,” Eddie said. “Haven’t seen him in a few weeks. The hospital assigned him after I tried stabbing myself with a metal rod.”

He lifted his shirt higher than he needed to, showing a puckered puncture scar on his stomach.

“Doctors said if it was another quarter inch to the right, I’d have been done for.”

Austin felt the old helplessness rise—the one that came right before he reached for rules, for anything that would make him feel useful.

He heard Will’s cane again behind him—tap, tap, tap—patient, satisfied.

Austin looked at the scar, then at Eddie’s face. He tried to keep it simple. Not polished. Not Greg-speak.

“Well… you’re still here,” he said. “So I’m gonna take that as… you’re not finished.”

Eddie’s eyes softened. He went quiet, throat working once.

“Well,” he said finally, voice smaller now, “I should probably get to sleep. Nice to meet you, Austin.”

He stepped back toward his bunk.

Austin stared down at the tile, the pen still in his hand, and felt the number sitting there like a splinter—twenty-four—while the list on the clipboard stayed stubbornly at twenty-three.

When he looked up, the room had changed.

Every guest was already in their bunk. Their breathing came heavy, in strange unison—chests rising and falling together, the mattresses shivering faintly with each exhale.

The wind rattled at the windows, but inside, the sound dulled, smothered, as if the air itself had thickened.

Austin set the clipboard down with care, like laying something fragile on glass.

He crossed the room, each step too loud against the floor. At the light switch, he hesitated. Maybe darkness would smooth it over, appease whatever had stolen the room yet again.

The fluorescents cut out. Darkness folded down over them all.

Every bulb in the room seemed to have died, save the bathroom. Light bled from its cracks in long, skeletal lines across the floor.

Austin stood still until the rhythm of the breathing settled into the black. Then, with a shaky breath of his own, he decided: trays, cups, coffee for breakfast. If he kept busy—if he made the morning ready—he might not have to think about the night.

The way to the kitchen was dim, the light stretched thin along the ceiling. It sat higher than he remembered—or maybe he was shrinking into himself, smaller with every step. Windows framed the dining room in a long row. Through the glass, the snow had already laid claim to the world outside, erasing lines, smothering edges. The city was still out there, but farther away than it should’ve been, as if the storm had pushed it back miles in just moments.

Austin stopped. His breath fogged the window, and for a second it looked like he was staring into a place no one lived anymore.

Was he losing his mind? He tried to ask himself honestly. And then another thought followed, quieter, heavier: Would it even matter if he was?

A plea rose from Austin’s bones before he could stop it.

“God, what is happening to me?”

But almost as soon as he spoke it, he caught himself. Maybe that wasn’t the right question.

“God… what are you doing?”

First Darrick. Then the conference room. Each moment had slipped through his grip like water, as though the world itself was sliding away from him. The kitchen, he told himself, would be different. The kitchen would be steady—his anchor.

He stepped inside and scanned the room. Lists were taped neatly to the counters, instructions spelled out in the cook’s careful handwriting. Meals planned for every day of the storm. Some trays already portioned, waiting in the walk-in fridge. It wasn’t just Greg’s foresight he felt behind him. As he stood in the cold light of the kitchen, he grasped that other hands had been here too—preparing, arranging, guiding. He could almost feel their presence lingering in the air, quiet but close, watching to see whether he would follow.

The lock clicked. Austin turned the key and swung the pantry door open. Rows of cans stared back at him—soups, beans, generic pasta, a few stale doughnuts in a torn box. Relief flickered. Enough to stretch a few days, maybe more. He reached for the bags of coffee.

Something clung to his ankle, dragging upward as though a can of chicken stock had sprouted fingers. Austin lurched back so hard he nearly dropped the bag. He didn’t look again. He slammed the pantry door, shoving it hard enough to rattle the frame, and stumbled into the kitchen, chest heaving.

“That’s enough for tonight,” he muttered. “Sleep. I need sleep.”

But when he stepped into the dining room, the air shifted.

Every chair had turned. Dozens of them, all angled toward him, their backs perfectly aligned, their metal legs biting into the floor. The dining room was longer—tables stretching on and on, doubling back, multiplying. The chairs filled every space.

He’d looked too long past the veil, and now the veil was looking back. They would drag him down under the streets through secret tunnels—grind his body into dust, and let it sift onto the top of the drop ceiling to be lost.

He took a step back. The chairs screeched forward in unison.

The sound split him open. A thousand metal legs scraping across linoleum, grinding like molars, sparks shrieking from the floor. He clutched his ears, but it didn’t matter. The noise drilled through cartilage and bone. A slow trickle of warmth spilled down his neck. His fingertips came away slick—blood, thickened, almost clotted, as though his skull itself were weeping.

Austin turned and stumbled toward the chapel. The floor stretched beneath him, lengthening, as though the distance between him and the door doubled with every stride. Behind him, a chair gave chase, its legs clawing across the endless floor. The sound of pursuit wasn’t just scraping anymore—it was gnashing, chewing, the furniture of the world tearing him apart before they ever reached him.

He slammed into the chapel door as though it had leapt toward him at the last second. He threw it shut. The windows were blacked out, not from the storm but from something thicker, heavier, as though tar had sealed them shut.

The chair battered the door. Each impact rattled the hinges, old wood bowing inward with splintering cracks. Austin staggered toward the exit—then the sound shifted. Not in front of him anymore. Inside the walls. Metal legs racing through the studs, stomping along seams that he couldn’t follow.

Austin turned.

The door was gone. It had never been there at all.

He was being played with.

At the center of the room stood the chair, warped with violence. The air around it wavered, shivering as though heat rose from blood itself.

The air trembled. The chair seemed to lean, not moving but beckoning. Around Austin, the chapel swelled with noise—sirens, cups scraping against concrete, refrigerator hums, knuckles tapping on doorframes. All of it layered together, not sounds anymore but a single roar: the abyss calling his name.

He almost let it take him. But then the bunks flashed through his mind—their weight, their need. Eddie’s scar. Gerald’s anger. Will’s hand shaking on the cane.

If he went, they’d go too.

The thought tore through him like air after drowning.

Austin turned, forcing his legs to move. He burst through the other exit of the chapel and ran, directing himself toward Greg’s office—the only place that might still hold steady ground.

The roar thinned behind him, dissolving into echoes. By the time he shut Greg’s office door, silence had taken its place. He switched on a lamp. The warm glow settled over the room, soft and perfect, as if none of it had happened.

Then the ringing settled in—a high, piercing whine that swallowed half the room. The dried blood itched along his jawline. He fumbled through Greg’s first aid kit, hands clumsy, pulling out an alcohol pad. The sting when he wiped his ear shot down his neck, sharp enough to make him clench his teeth. He tore a strip of gauze and pushed it in, crude, too deep maybe, but it was all he knew. Just a plug. Just something to keep the blood in.

Austin lay his hand on the desk for balance, waiting for the spinning in his head to slow. The ringing never stopped.

He made his bed, set the alarm a little before breakfast, and lowered himself onto the mattress. The lamplight glowed steady, a pocket of warmth holding against the dark.

He missed his classroom.

Pretty much what the title says. We're tired of solo-queuing in Valorant and CS2 only to get matched with toxic teammates or people who don't communicate.

We’re trying to get a solid Bangalore-based gaming community going under **Aretaxia**. The goal is to have a group where you can always find a duo or a full stack for:

* **FPS:** Valo, CS2, Apex
* **MOBAs:** Dota 2 (if you hate yourself), League
* **Casual:** Even some BGMI or CoD Mobile if people are up for it
* or you just want to decompress after a long shift with some low-stress stuff like **Among Us, or Fall Guys**, you’re welcome.

Since we're all local, the plan isn't just to stay online. We already run a book club and tech/startup meetups here, so we’re planning to organize **actual LAN tournaments and cafe meetups** once we have enough people. It’s way better winning (or losing) when you can grab a beer or a coffee with the team after.

If you’re in Bangalore and want to join the Discord, just comment what you’re playing right now or shoot me a DM.",1,1770294904.0,BangaloreSocial,1,1.0,False

I am on a non stimulant ADHD med because I’m also on medications for my heart.  I can’t drink anymore, smoke anymore, and I can barely tolerate coffee.  

I use to be able to socially drink and smoke with all my friends and family when they come over to play cards every week, but now I’m the sober one watching everyone else have fun.  It sucks.

I’ve been working from home for 4 years now, I make more than when I was working in office for another company.  I love it, it’s super convenient for me and my family.  The problem is I’m lacking motivation, have poor time management, and procrastinate BAD.  

I’ve made huge life changes for my health in the last 6 months that I had no choice but to make and with those changes I’ve tried making good habits.  IT’S HARD.  I’m so use to being able to juggle everything with ease by crushing caffeine and letting loose a little bit, but now that I can’t it feels like I’m being punished for enjoying my twenties and my brain fog continues to get worse.  

I wake up, get my kids to school, check my social media (I’m also a content creator), then clock in and work, kids get home, I clock out, run errands if I need to, cook dinner, everybody games or watches movies together for a bit before bed, I give hubby affection and attention, stay up to manage my content, then fall asleep around 1-2 am.  

I’m mentally checked out while I work, it’s like my fingers are slower than my mind and with my workload, I can’t keep up.  I know I’m more than capable, but when it comes down to buckling down and getting s\*\*\* done I do my best work last minute when there is a deadline.

I guess what I’m trying to say is what can I do to be the best at my job and stay on top of it all?

We don’t have sharwd classes either. But since I was in campus early, he invited me to grab coffee and to hangout in his org/club room. We ended up chatting. 

At first I thought we were alone so I mentioned this concert coming up in campus and was planning to ask him.. but turns out there was a 3rd person (a member). When he asked if I planned on going, I was gonna say i’m thinking about it _then_ ask him to go with me. Since we weren’t alone, I just said i’m thinking about it. He teases me saying I’m bringing it up because I’m going with someone. 

I panicked internally and said no i’m not planning on that and instead changed the topic by saying I don’t really know the artists. I show him the list and he also doesn’t know any of them. I managed to shift the conversation to artist we’d like to have instead.

When that was over, he invited me to come to class with him because it’s related to my program. I ended up going with him and it was pretty nice. My next class was in the same building so he walked with me but then asked if he could sit in. He stayed in my class and skipped his own.

We then grabbed lunch, ate at their club room again, chatted some more until eventually i had to go because of my last class.

It’s best suited for folks whose **tinnitus gets worse with anxiety** or poor sleep, and it's part of a growing list of **natural treatments for tinnitus** that people turn to after exhausting other options.

If you’ve been on the hunt for a **plant-based solution for tinnitus**, this might be your next experiment.

# 🧬 How Does It Work?

Most **over-the-counter tinnitus relief** options focus on boosting circulation or supporting inner ear function. This one takes a different route.

By targeting stress and poor sleep, **Sonic Solace** helps you **calm the nervous system to stop ringing in the ears**. For some, that alone makes a big difference.

This is a **natural tinnitus relief that helps with stress**, especially the kind that builds when silence turns into static.

If your **tinnitus is worse with anxiety**, you’ll likely notice a shift in how your body responds to the noise once you [start to relax](https://theworldhealth.org/sonic-solace-official).

# 🌱 Key Ingredients & Their Benefits

Each dose of Sonic Solace contains ingredients often seen in **herbal remedies for tinnitus and insomnia**. Here's the core lineup:

* **Corydalis**: Known to ease nerve-related discomfort. Great for those struggling with a pulsing or electric hum.
* **Passionflower**: Famous for its **tinnitus benefits**, it promotes calm and helps with sleep.
* **California Poppy Seed**: Supports better rest and may reduce nighttime nervous energy.
* **Marshmallow Root**: Helps soothe internal irritation and promotes comfort.
* **Prickly Pear**: A powerful antioxidant that may improve **ear nerve support** through healthier circulation.

Together, they offer a gentle and consistent approach to managing noise without synthetic fillers.

# 🧪 Personal Experience With Sonic Solace (Told by Uncle Ray’s Fishing Buddy, Don)

Let me introduce you to Don—he’s been my Uncle Ray’s fishing buddy for over 20 years, the kind of guy who can gut a trout with one hand and grill it with the other.

But for the past few years, the only thing louder than his fish stories was the **ringing in his ears**. He said it started after years of working around heavy machinery and got worse once he hit retirement.

“It’s like having a mosquito jam session in your brain 24/7,” he told me over coffee.

Don started [using Sonic Solace](https://theworldhealth.org/sonic-solace-official) a few months back after I mentioned it during a family get-together. At first, he was skeptical—he’s not exactly the herbal tea type.

But sleep had been elusive, and it was starting to show.

The first week? Nothing dramatic. But by week two, he noticed he wasn’t waking up five times a night just to stare at the ceiling and curse. He started saying things like,

“It’s still there, but I can ignore it now,” which, coming from Don, is practically a love letter.

He’s not big on tech, but even he said the **natural tinnitus treatment** helped him feel more grounded—less irritable, less tired, and a little more like himself.

His only complaint? “Those pills are horse-sized,” he joked, “but I’ve swallowed worse at deer camp.”

All in all, Don’s sticking with it. Not because it fixed him, but because it helped him *live with the noise without it living rent-free in his head*.

# ✅ Pros and Cons

# Pros

⬆️ **Gentle and effective** — A **natural treatment for tinnitus** that doesn’t knock you out or mess with your gut.

⬆️ **Full-year guarantee** — Gives you time to truly evaluate. No rush.

⬆️ **Great for light sleepers** — Many use it as a **tinnitus supplement for better sleep**, and it delivers.

# Cons

⬇️ **Large capsule size** — Might need to pair it with a good gulp of water or your go-to smoothie.

⬇️ **Not a cure** — If you're looking to **stop tinnitus caused by stress** completely, results will likely vary.

⬇️ **Requires patience** — This isn’t a plug-and-play fix. Results take time.

# 🗣️ Customer Feedback and Real Reviews

One user said, “It didn’t cure me, but it turned down the volume.” For many, that’s enough to improve life significantly.

# ⏳ How Long Does It Take to See Results?

This isn’t an instant mute button. Most people report a noticeable shift after **10–14 days**, with stronger effects by week three.

Some said the ringing felt less sharp. Others felt their anxiety lift first—which then made the **ear ringing at night** more tolerable.

Like many **natural tinnitus treatments**, it’s a slow build. Give it time. Give it consistency. That’s where the value kicks in.

From curated materials to thoughtful lighting and textures, Luxury contemporary home decor is shown as a timeless approach to elevated everyday living.***

https://preview.redd.it/hvdz53zo4ohg1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a530984072285d583db63cd4b7baa0245e2db84

In an era where aesthetics meet experience, [**Modern Luxury Home Decor**](https://whatsforyourhome.com/) has emerged as more than just a trend—it’s a lifestyle. It marries form with function, boldness with balance, and simplicity with sophistication. From sweeping open spaces to curated corners that feel like art installations, this style transforms ordinary rooms into personal sanctuaries.

But what exactly makes a home feel *luxurious* in today’s design landscape? The answer isn’t confined to expensive materials or flashy accents. Instead, it lives in thoughtful choices, purposeful design, and a harmony that feels effortless yet intentional. Welcome to the world of luxury contemporary [**Home Decor**](https://whatsforyourhome.com/product-category/home-decor/), where every detail matters, and comfort is king.

**1. Defining Modern Luxury: More than Just Aesthetic**

At its core, Modern Luxury Home Decor embraces clean lines, rich textures, and a sense of openness. Yet, it avoids minimalism’s cold sterility. Instead, it infuses warmth, personality, and curated layers that invite you in.

This is a style that respects space—not fills it. It allows breathing room for light, shadows, and moments of calm. With Luxury contemporary home decor, each piece, whether vintage or brand new, contributes to a cohesive narrative.

You might see a grand marble-topped table in a dining room, or a shaping of light hitting a sculptural lamp in the living area. These aren’t just decorations—they are experiences.

**2. The Soul of Modern Luxury: Materials That Speak**

The foundation of any luxurious space is the materials. Whether subtle or striking, they define the tactile emotional pull of a room.

**• Natural stone**—marble, onyx, travertine—brings gravity and timelessness.

**• Rich woods**—walnut, oak, teak—offer warmth and texture.

**• Plush fabrics**—velvet, boucle, silk—invite touch and comfort.

**• Metallic accents**—brass, chrome, matte black—add sparkle without showiness.

In Luxury contemporary home decor, these materials aren’t just chosen—they are orchestrated. Imagine a living room where a deep blue velvet sofa sits opposite an ash wood credenza, framed by brushed brass lighting. The scene feels lavish, yet grounded. It feels intentional.

It’s not about how much you have—it’s about how well those elements converse.

https://preview.redd.it/c92wczos4ohg1.jpg?width=538&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fb68f1e9f01cd5fe02295811441da38cc7ecf24

**3. Color Stories That Breathe Life In**

While some interior styles lean toward stark whites or monochrome palettes, modern luxury embraces nuance.

Warm neutrals—creams, taupes, greys—set the stage. But then? Contrast enters. Deep emeralds, muted blues, and charcoal blacks punctuate spaces with gravity and play.

Some designers are even turning to jewel tones as accent walls or upholstery choices. These colors don’t shout; they whisper sophistication.

Carefully curated color palettes ensure that each room feels distinct, yet connected. Walls, trim, floors, textiles, and art—each layer participates in an elegant, dynamic interplay.

**4. Functionality Woven with Beauty**

A hallmark of *Modern Luxury Home Decor* is that nothing is gratuitous. Every item should fulfill a purpose—practical, visual, or emotional.

A coffee table is not just a surface; it’s a conversation starter. A light fixture is not merely illumination; it’s a work of art.

Take kitchens, for example. Luxury contemporary kitchens are sleek, but not sterile. They mix state-of-the-art appliances with handcrafted cabinetry. Countertops are expansive, yet warm to the eye and touch. These spaces feel alive—ready for gathering, creativity, and nourishment.

Bedrooms, too, become retreats rather than showrooms. Plush headboards. Layers of sumptuous bedding. Dimmers that shift mood without effort. A place to rest feels almost sacred in these settings.

**5. The Art of Layered Lighting**

Lighting is an unsung hero in luxury interiors. Get it right, and a room transforms. Get it wrong, and even the most exquisite design falls flat.

In Luxury contemporary home decor, lighting is layered:

**• Ambient** for overall mood.

**• Task** for reading, working, or cooking.

**• Accent** to highlight art, texture, or focal points.

Consider a grand chandelier above a dining table. It provides drama and ceremony. But complement it with soft wall sconces, and suddenly the space feels warm, rich, and inviting.

Lighting isn’t an afterthought here. It’s a character in the narrative.

**6. Art and Sculptures: Personal Statements in Space**

A home should tell a story. And nothing conveys personal taste quite like art.

Whether it’s a large abstract canvas over a sofa or a curated collection of sculptures on floating shelves, art breathes individuality into luxury spaces.

Echoing the principles of *Modern Luxury Home Decor*, artwork should:

• Reflect personality

• Create visual anchors in rooms

• Play with scale and texture

• Balance negative space

Art isn’t merely decoration—it’s a dialogue between the resident and the room.

**7. Textiles That Comfort and Captivate**

Texture is the silent amplifier of luxury. In textiles, this becomes clear.

Imagine:

• A buttery soft throw casually draped over a sofa.

• Sheer curtains filtering gentle sunlight.

• A sculptural rug underfoot defining a conversation area.

• Pillow arrangements that feel relaxed yet refined.

Textiles in *Luxury contemporary home decor* are functional but visually magnetic. They cushion, define, and elevate every square foot of space.

**8. The Outdoor Connection**

Modern luxury doesn’t end at the walls. Outdoor spaces, terraces, and balconies become extensions of the interior, blurring boundaries between inside and outside.

Seating areas with weather-resistant but chic furniture. Planters with sculptural greenery. Hidden lighting that evokes evening ambiance.

In essence, your outdoor space becomes another room—equally curated, equally luxurious.

**9. Balancing Minimalism and Opulence**

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of *Modern Luxury Home Decor* is how it walks a fine line: minimalism without austerity. Opulence without excess.

Rooms feel spacious and calm, yet full of intention. This balance isn’t accidental. It’s achieved by asking a simple question for every choice: Does this elevate the experience?

If the answer is yes—keep it. If no—refine it or remove it.

This rigorous approach results in spaces that feel:

• Uncluttered yet expressive

• Luxurious yet livable

• Bold yet timeless

**10. Final Thoughts: A Home That Breathes Story**

Luxury is not a price tag. It’s a feeling.

At [*whatsforyourhome.com*](http://whatsforyourhome.com), we believe that *Modern Luxury Home Decor* is a thoughtful blend of artistry and ease, where each room feels curated but not curated-to-death. It’s warmth without chaos. It’s elegance without pretension.

Luxury contemporary home decor transforms spaces into reflections of self—elevating daily life into something richer, softer and more profound.

**Lattafa Atheri:** I am not someone who look forward to beautiful packaging, for me if the product works its good to go, but damn atheri bottle and box is so pretty that it literally felt like I gifted myself some cute stuff.

If we talk about fragrance itself, hands down a beautiful fragrance, one can never go wrong with it, this is floral, imagine a bouquet, with subtle and pleasant perfume, not overpowering, but sweet. I think bee packaging is indeed an excellent choice because you'll be smelling like garden full of flowers you are ought to attract bees!

**Paris Corner Vanilla December:** I am a december baby so perfume named December was must for me, and at that if we add vanilla to it then its game over for me. This vanilla is little different than other vanillas I have used, its not sweet but rather strong, boozy opening again the note is rum so understandable, dont overspray it, projection is beast with this one,but after sometime it changes in to a subtle floral, like you wont even realize its the same perfume, I would say I will keep it for nights, it literally gives festive.

**Paris Corner Eternal Coffee:** Decent packaging, vey coffeeesque, I am a fan of cocoa and coffee, I cant live without vasline coco butter moisturizer and Stives coffee scrub, if you are a fan, this perfume wont disappoint, its literally sweet coffee mixed with cocoa. Its creamy coffee latte literally and I am in love! Projection excellent, might not stay for hours on skin but clings on clothes forever.

**Lattafa Nebras:** This is elegant, opens with beautiful citrusy notes, mixed with chocolates and vanilla, not overpowering sweet, its grownup, I love the bottle too, it starts strong and stays thats a plus. two sprays and you are sorted for hours! Kind of perfume that turns head. I am definitely not going to outgrow this.

* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

I'm courting this beautiful sweet girl and we're both always busy daily because we're always trying to optimise our time as developing individuals. 

Whenever we have plans for each other it always makes me smile, being with her just makes my life so meaningful and worth striving for. 

She essentially continuously shows me how to be a better person every single day and I couldn't be any more than happier to have her as someone I love and adore. 

What I like about our daily communications is that we're 80% on voice, so like there's always that sense of care and understanding whenever we communicate. And the way she asked me that made my night to sunshine morning! Who needs coffee when you have someone like her. 😁

They said it's just a waste of money when I'm not spending their money. It's all from my pocket. There is no reason for me to be guilty spending either because I'm an only child and have no siblings to send to school (It's a  culture here in the Philippines to be our parent's retirement plan and send all our siblings and sometimes cousins to university). How could they say this when they were willing to raise money (50k USD) for my uncle who was 78 years old and died of CDK because of years of drinking and gambling. Meanwhile, I have never even tasted a can of soda, do not drink coffee, and don't drink alcohol even at 26.

They say, I should accept if it's God's will for me to die. I am a christian (which is something they keep doubting just because I avoid people and go to mass online) but I think God helps those who helps themselves too.

So, I'm needing to create zones for the dining area and living room but it is feeling very disjointed. We definitely need some rugs and maybe more furniture. We have a coffee table and cabinet arriving next week.

Also our couch situation is a bit weird. We have an L-shaped couch that used to be longer (a 3x2 configuration) and an arm chair which worked well in the old place. It was a bit too long in the new lounge so my husband converted the arm chair into a 2 seater and I'm not sure I'm loving the layout.

Day 1-5: Asked strangers for directions even when I knew where I was going. Just to practice starting conversations.

Day 6-10: Complimented random people on something genuine like their jacket or dog. Most people smiled back.

Day 11-15: Started conversations with cashiers and baristas beyond just ordering. Asked how their day was going.

Day 16-20: Attended local meetups and forced myself to introduce myself to at least 3 new people each time.

Day 21-25: Asked coworkers to grab lunch instead of eating alone at my desk.

Day 26-30: Signed up for an improv class and actually showed up.

1qwjjgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedlnMen/comments/1qwjjgd/1_hormone_expert_stop_crashing_at_3pm_this_secret/,1 hormone expert: STOP crashing at 3PM! THIS secret habit that will CHANGE your life,"Feel like you're running great all morning but then hit a wall around 3PM? Like out of nowhere your brain fogs up, your energy tanks, and you start craving sugar or caffeine like your life depends on it? It’s not just you. That crash is one of the most common patterns reported by people in their 20s, 30s, and even 40s. But most people treat the symptoms, not the root cause. This post is for anyone who's sick of energy rollercoasters and wants a fix that actually worksresearched from top endocrinologists, published medical literature, expert podcasts, and more.

Dr. Sara Gottfried (Harvard-trained hormone expert) calls the mid-afternoon crash “the cortisol cliff.” Your body is designed to follow a natural cortisol rhythmhigh in the morning, tapering down smoothly by bedtime. But most modern lifestyles wreck that curve. We overstimulate early with caffeine, skip meals, sit all day, and wonder why we burn out by 3PM.

This isn't just about energy. It messes with your sleep, focus, weight regulation, and mood. Fixing it starts with this one habit: front-loading your mornings to regulate your hormones.

Here’s what the best research-backed people recommend:

1. Eat breakfast with protein and fat within 60 minutes of waking up  

   A 2022 paper from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that starting the day with 30g of protein helped regulate cortisol and insulin better than skipping or eating carb-heavy meals. This balances blood sugar, preventing crashes later.

2. Get outside in natural light for 5–10 minutes before 10AM  

   Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks this down in his podcast. Morning sunlight sets the circadian clock in your brain, telling your body to release cortisol in the right amount and at the right time. Artificial light doesn't cut it.

3. Ditch the stimulant-caffeine cycle before breakfast  

   Drinking coffee before eating spikes cortisol worse. Dr. Matthew Walker (author of Why We Sleep) and recent UCLA studies both show that morning coffee on an empty stomach dysregulates cortisol and contributes to the afternoon crash.

4. Strength train or walk before noon  

   Harvard research published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise showed that moderate morning exercise helps stabilize cortisol and blood glucose for 6–10 hours. That means steadier energy all day.

5. Cut out hidden sugar before lunch  

   A report from Harvard Health and the Mayo Clinic both confirm that sugary drinks and even “healthy” granola bars lead to an early insulin spike then crashsetting you up for that 3PM energy slump.

This stuff works. Not overnight, but within 3–5 days your energy curve starts shifting. Fix your mornings, and your afternoons fix themselves. All hormone-driven. All science-backed.",1,1770293191.0,LockedlnMen,0,1.0,False

This seems to happen more so when I attempt an early bed time (10.30pm), but I often need to go to bed at this time. So it means when I finally get back to sleep and then my alarm goes off a couple of hours later, I’m exhausted. 

I have noticed relapses/ nocturnal emissions do seem to line up with me sleeping better. 

Thing I’ve tried: 

\- Magnesium glycinate 

\- Phone off at 9pm 

\- Last meal between 6.30 - 7.30

\- Not drinking close to bed (to avoid waking up to pee) 

\- No coffee  

Possible culprits: 

\- Stress/ anxiety (this happens even when I don’t feel stressed however) 

\- Semen retention 

\- 10g creatine in the morning (have heard this can effect sleep for some people) 

\- Other supps include 5k D3, Vit K, 9mg Boron, 12.5mg Zinc

\- Dense protein rich diet. Last meal is often heavy as I don’t want to be in a food coma at any other point in the day. Even when I eat as early as 6pm it still seems to digest for a long time.

I have a tiny balcony that I use for very boring things: sitting with coffee, airing out blankets, sometimes working on my laptop when the weather is decent. A few months ago my upstairs neighbor moved in. I didn’t think much of it at first. Then I started finding stuff on my balcony floor. At first it was dust and crumbs, which I brushed off as normal apartment living. Then it escalated. One morning I walked out and found sunflower seed shells everywhere, like someone had been actively snacking above me. A few days later it was clumps of hair and lint. I genuinely stood there staring at it, trying to understand how that much hair ends up falling straight down. The worst part is the timing. It almost always happens early in the morning or late evening, which makes it feel weirdly personal, even though I know it probably isn’t. I finally saw it happen while I was outside. She leaned over her railing and shook out a tablecloth, sending crumbs and dust raining down directly onto my chair and plants. I looked up and said, pretty calmly, “Hey, could you not do that over my balcony?” She looked annoyed and said something like “It’s just dust” and disappeared inside. Since then it’s been a pattern. Blankets, rugs, sometimes even wet laundry getting shaken out so that water drips down onto my stuff. I tried leaving a polite note in the hallway asking whoever lives upstairs to please shake things out over their own balcony or inside. The note vanished, but nothing changed. I tried talking to her again and she snapped that this is how she’s always done it and that I’m being dramatic. I started documenting it with dates and descriptions, because it was making me anxious in my own home. I don’t want to escalate this into some huge battle, but I’m tired of cleaning someone else’s mess off my space. I’ve stopped leaving things outside, which defeats the whole point of having a balcony. I also catch myself listening for footsteps above me, waiting for the next shower of crumbs. It sounds ridiculous written out, but living with this constant low-level annoyance is exhausting. I’m not asking for silence or perfection, just basic consideration. Right now it feels like my home is slowly shrinking because one person refuses to acknowledge that gravity exists. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if this is just one of those neighbor situations that never really gets better.

For context, I am currently partnered to my nesting partner and we cohabitate, have pets together etc.

A few months ago I met someone online that I really, really came to like. We started as friends but after a few months it developed into something more. This person was there with me through a lot - they didn't always know what I was going through to the fullest extent but they were a pretty consistent part of my life and eventually we began speaking sexually/romantically with each other. I felt a connection with them that is very rare for me because from our friendship, I discovered so many things matched up like interests, hobbies, intellectual topics, sexuality and kinks. We just got along like a house on fire (idek why that is a saying honestly lol).  
They knew I was poly + partnered from the start and were fine with it.

The other day, I met them in person for the first time for a vibe check/coffee date and it went really well. We are insanely attracted to one another and we both laughed so much. We kissed and it felt electric. Once I got home I realised I had never outright had the convo with them about essentially what we both wanted from this. They want basically a FWB situation where intimacy, sex, connection and consistency are the core. I wanted this as well, but I have come to realise I also want the open-ended possibility of it becoming something more if it naturally progresses. Not looking for a LTR at the moment but I want that possibility open, basically. 

What I did not realise until told in this conversation was that their ultimate goal was a monogamous relationship in the future, but they were happy to explore with me because they don't want a LTR right now. All good and fine and I agreed, perhaps maybe in fear of losing them? I'm not sure.

But then I started mulling it over over a couple of days and I realised I like them way, \*\*way\*\* more than I thought I did, and the idea of starting some kind of relationship with them that has a certain expiration date gives me a LOT of anxiety, fear and almost pre-emptive heartbreak. I'm not a person that can do things in halves. If I fall, I fall hard. I cannot see any way in which this relationship would not result in a pretty painful ending, at least for me, and I feel like I would always be unrelaxed and bracing.   
Our trajectories/long term goals in this regard are so distant from each other, and it just felt like I would be being untrue to myself to tell myself I can cap my feelings, I can like them only to a certain extent because I know they will not want anything with me beyond that - I can't. Heart on my sleeve kinda girl.

Essentially I told them a way less wordy version of this today and that I wished to be friends, not because of anything bad about them but in fact the opposite. They were understandably cold and distant, but I think I've actually really hurt them and it sucks. I miss them a lot already.    
  
I feel a lot of guilt and uncertainty, but I know that the anxiety my body keeps going through is a sign that this isn't going to end well for me if I continue it. It really fucking sucks that pretty much everything else is so well aligned except for this.

I (25F) am with my hubby (29M) for almost 5 years, married for almost 1. I’m working as a pediatric nurse, sometimes I do overtime. My husband has a typical physical job.

I come from a pathological and poor family, where there was a lot of psychological and physical abuse, there was not enough money for food and in the winter we slept in jackets because we could not afford heating. On the other hand, my husband grew up in a family where there was no shortage of money, but he had 2 sick sisters (1 adopted), who died. He has only one sister left (she is 11 years old). He also had problems in his family, because his biological father abandoned him and his stepfather is an alcoholic.

Before we get together we knew eachother for about 4 years and for about 1 year right before starting relationship we were close friends. We started dating when we were roommates. After about half a year, we moved into his apartment. We don't argue often, they are not big and loud quarrels. We always try to solve everything on an ongoing basis and we worked on communication for a long time (my husband has autism, so we really worked a lot on it). We have a rule that we never go to bed in the middle of a conflict. Neither of us is perfect, because there are simply no such people. Sometimes we disagree on something, we don't understand each other, but we still try to find a solution to every situation.

When I started working as a nurse, I got depressed and was in a very bad condition. For 3 years I attended group therapy for Adult Children of Alcoholics. I completed it successfully, and at this point I am slowly coming down from psychiatric drugs. My husband (then still a bf) always supported me a lot in this, actually he taught me that I could let others take care of me.

For as long as I can remember, my husband has great respect for my profession. In our relationship, I earn more and I am able to save more. The renovation of the apartment and the new car were mainly paid for by me, as well as all holidays. It doesn't bother any of us, my husband always says that I studied and worked hard to be where I am now. I often come back from my 12-hour shifts physically and mentally tired. I work mostly at night shift. 

I never have to worry about household chores. My husband cooks, cleans and even massages me almost every day for at least an hour (I have problems with chronic back pain). When I was hospitalised in March with sepsis, he took a vacation from work to come to me every day and spend time with me from morning to night. He almost always drives me to work and picks me up from her, he takes me to meetings with friends and picks me up from them, even if I come back from a party in the middle of the night, he tells me to call him so that he can pick me up. He wakes me up with coffee, makes me breakfast and always make sure that I’m eating during the day (sometimes I have problem with this) when he’s not at home.

He always says that he loves me very much and that I am the most important. He always says I'm in the first place for him and he always gonna put me above everyone else.

1qwj9x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1qwj9x4/i_accidentally_gave_my_mornings_a_tiny_ritual_and/,I accidentally gave my mornings a tiny “ritual” and it’s weirdly grounding,"A few weeks ago I noticed my mornings had started to feel like one long, quiet blur: wake up, coffee, keys, out the door, same sidewalks, same bus stop, same automatic thoughts. Nothing bad, nothing exciting either, just a steady loop. On a random Tuesday I missed my usual bus by maybe 30 seconds. I stood there looking at the empty road and the little digital sign counting down to the next one, and I realized I had never actually read the community noticeboard inside the bus shelter. It’s been there forever, with those curled corners and faded flyers that all look like they’re from three years ago. So I walked over and properly looked. There were the usual things (lost cat from last summer, guitar lessons, a handwritten note about a set of keys found near the park), but in the bottom corner someone had taped a tiny weekly schedule for the local library’s “micro events”. Not big author talks or anything, just stuff like “ten minute poem at noon” or “bring one houseplant cutting” or “quiet puzzle table available”. I don’t even go to that library much, but seeing it made me smile in a very neutral way, like, oh right, people are just doing little things out here. The next day I got to the stop a bit early on purpose and read the board again, and then I did it again the day after. It turned into a small habit without me deciding it was one. Now, most mornings, I arrive two or three minutes early, and I check the board like it’s the news. I’ve learned that someone in my neighborhood really wants to trade sourdough starter, someone else keeps re-posting the same flyer about a missing mitten (just one mitten, not both), and there is a regular typed sheet that lists which days the community garden gate will be open. One day there was a flyer for a tiny “repair cafe” where you can bring a lamp or a toaster and someone might help you fix it. I don’t have anything broken right now, but I tore off the little phone number tabs anyway and put one in my wallet, just in case. I also started bringing my coffee in a smaller thermos, because the extra minute at the stop means I’m actually sipping it slowly instead of gulping it while walking. It’s still the same morning, same route, same everything, but there’s this small pause that feels like a comma in the sentence. Sometimes the board has nothing new and that’s fine. Sometimes there’s a new flyer that’s slightly crooked and you can tell someone put it up in a hurry. It’s kind of comforting in a low-stakes way. I didn’t “improve my life” or anything dramatic like that, I just found a tiny spot where the day feels a little more human, and it cost me exactly two minutes and some tape-smudged fingers.

1qwiwps,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qwiwps/what_happens_to_your_brain_when_you_quit_social/,What Happens to Your BRAIN When You Quit Social Media (Science-Based Breakdown),"
So I fell into this rabbit hole researching why quitting Instagram felt harder than quitting coffee. Turns out, there's actual neuroscience behind this, not just weakness or lack of discipline. Your brain literally rewires itself around these apps, and when you pull the plug, shit gets weird.

I've been studying this through research papers, podcasts, and books because I was sick of the ""just delete the apps"" advice that completely ignores what's happening in your skull. Here's what I found.

**1. Your dopamine system is basically hijacked**

Social media companies employ literal neuroscientists to make their platforms addictive. Every notification, like, and comment triggers dopamine release, the same chemical involved in gambling and substance addiction. The intermittent reinforcement (you never know when you'll get that dopamine hit) makes it especially potent.

When you quit, your brain freaks out because it's used to those regular dopamine spikes. You get restless, anxious, even depressed. This isn't weakness, it's your neurochemistry adjusting. The good news? Your dopamine receptors can recover, but it takes time. Usually 2-4 weeks before the intense cravings ease up.

Dr. Anna Lembke's book [Dopamine Nation](https://icrrd.com/public/media/16-05-2021-051456The-Obstacle-Is-the-Way.pdf) (she's the chief of Stanford Addiction Medicine) destroys everything you think you know about pleasure and pain. She explains how our brains maintain balance, and how constant dopamine hits from social media throw that balance completely off. This book will make you question every scroll. She uses patient stories to show how digital addictions are processed identically to drug addictions in the brain. Insanely good read that actually changed how I view my phone.

**2. The first 72 hours are genuinely brutal**

Research shows the acute withdrawal phase peaks around day 3. You'll experience FOMO on steroids, phantom vibrations, compulsive checking of the app icon that's no longer there. Your brain is literally searching for its fix.

One study from the University of Bath found that one week off social media significantly reduced anxiety and depression, but participants reported the first few days as extremely difficult. They felt disconnected, bored, and irritable.

Practical tip: replace the behavior, don't just delete it. When you feel the urge to scroll, have a specific alternative ready. Could be a 2 minute breathing exercise, a physical book, or the Finch app (genuinely helps with building new habits through a cute virtual pet system, way less cringe than it sounds).

**3. Your sense of self gets destabilized**

Here's the part nobody talks about. Social media doesn't just give you dopamine hits, it literally shapes your identity. You curate a version of yourself, you get validation for certain types of content, you start performing your life rather than living it.

When you quit, you suddenly have to figure out who you are without an audience. It's disorienting as hell. You'll catch yourself thinking ""this would make a good post"" then remember you're not posting anymore. That cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable but necessary for reclaiming authentic experiences.

Cal Newport's *Digital Minimalism* breaks down why our brains weren't built for constant connection. He's a Georgetown computer science professor who's never had social media, and he provides a framework for intentional technology use. The book won WSJ and NYT praise for a reason. It includes a 30 day digital declutter process that actually works, unlike the cold turkey approaches that fail 90% of the time.

Another resource worth checking out is [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app from Columbia alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from research papers, expert insights, and books on behavioral psychology to create personalized audio content about breaking digital habits and building better ones. You can set your specific goal (like reducing screen time or improving focus) and it generates an adaptive learning plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives. The depth customization is useful when dealing with the restlessness that comes with quitting, you can adjust based on your attention span that day.

**4. Boredom becomes your superpower**

Social media eliminated boredom from our lives. Every spare second, we scroll. But boredom is actually when your brain does its best creative work, processes emotions, and consolidates memories.

The withdrawal period forces you to sit with boredom, and it's excruciating at first. But this is where the magic happens. Your brain starts generating ideas again. You actually daydream. You process experiences instead of immediately photographing them.

[Dr. Manoush Zomorodi's](https://www.manoushz.com/) podcast *Note to Self* (now called *ZigZag*) did an entire series called ""Bored and Brilliant"" exploring this. She presents research showing that boredom activates the default mode network, the part of your brain responsible for creativity and self-reflection. Worth listening to the whole series.

**5. Your attention span actually recovers**

Studies show heavy social media use literally shortens attention spans and reduces ability to focus deeply. The constant context switching (scrolling from topic to topic) trains your brain to expect novelty every few seconds.

When you quit, you'll notice you can't focus on long-form content at first. Books feel impossible. Movies feel slow. This improves gradually. Around week 3 or 4, most people report being able to focus for longer periods without that itchy need to check something.

The Ash app is solid for this transition period if you're dealing with the anxiety that comes up. It's like having a relationship coach/therapist that helps you work through the emotional stuff that surfaces when you're not numbing out with scrolls.

**6. Social connection becomes real again**

Ironic that ""social"" media makes us less social. Research from the University of Pennsylvania found that limiting social media to 30 minutes per day led to significant reductions in loneliness.

When you quit, you'll initially feel more isolated because you're missing the illusion of connection. But then something shifts. You start texting people directly. Making actual plans. Having conversations that aren't performed for an audience.

This feels awkward after years of curated interaction, but it's also deeply satisfying in a way scrolling never was. Your brain starts getting social fulfillment from actual human connection instead of the synthetic version.

**7. The urge never fully disappears, but it gets manageable**

Even after months, you'll still get occasional strong urges to reinstall. Usually triggered by stress, loneliness, or habit cues (sitting on the toilet, waiting in line, etc).

The difference is after the neurochemical adjustment period, these urges don't control you. They're just thoughts that pass. You notice them, acknowledge them, and move on.

The key is having systems in place for those moments. Keep your phone in another room at night. Use app blockers. Have replacement activities ready. Don't rely on willpower alone because willpower is finite and these apps are designed by teams of engineers to break it.

**The bottom line**: Your brain doesn't just ""miss"" social media when you quit. It goes through actual withdrawal because these platforms have literally altered your neurochemistry. The discomfort you feel is real, biological, and temporary. Your brain is remarkably plastic and will adapt. But you need to understand what's happening and have strategies beyond ""just be stronger.""

It gets easier. Your brain heals. You remember what it's like to be present. But those first few weeks are rough, and knowing why makes them slightly more bearable.

They all fight constantly. I live in another state with my kids and fiance, but somehow I end up in the middle of all their dramas via phone. 

My mum and sister live together and are at each others throats constantly. It's an awful situation. I had both of them calling me basically trying to get me on side, bitching about one another. They were both clearly in the wrong, there was shoving, a coffee got thrown, names were called. It was awful. I remained neutral.. told each of them what I felt they did wrong, and left it at that. 

I'm starting to feel really burdened by the drama, I'm never involved directly but everyone insists on contacting me to involve me. I have my own challenges with my own family and a 4 month old baby andna 2yo, I really don't have the mental space for this drama anymore. 

Would you just ask them not to involve you? They can be rather unreasonable and I do wonder if this would damage our relationships. I don't want anyone to feel they can't come to me, I just don't want it to be for the purpose of convincing me to side with them. Its so immature, especially when we range in age from 28-40, and then my mum is nearly 60. 

Is anyone elses family this chaotic and immature still even as adults? Surely this is not normal.

Not because they're rich, hot, or famous, but because they have this magnetic quality that makes you want to be around them? I used to think that was just luck or natural charisma. Turns out, it's not. It's a skill. And after diving deep into books, psychology research, and hours of podcasts on social dynamics, I've cracked the code on what actually makes people like you. This isn't about manipulation or fake smiles. It's about understanding human nature and using that knowledge to build genuine connections.

**Step 1: Stop Trying So Hard (Seriously)**

Here's the paradox: The more you try to make people like you, the less they will. Desperation smells worse than old gym socks. When you're overly eager, laughing too hard at bad jokes, or agreeing with everything someone says, people sense it. Their bullshit detector goes off.

Instead, focus on being **genuinely interested** rather than interesting. This is straight out of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", which is basically the bible of social skills. Carnegie says people care way more about themselves than they care about you. So flip the script. Ask questions. Listen like their words are gold. Not that fake nodding thing while you plan what to say next. Actually listen.

When someone feels heard, they associate that good feeling with YOU. It's not manipulation, it's just how our brains work.

**Step 2: Mirror Their Energy (The Chameleon Effect)**

This is backed by actual science. When you subtly mirror someone's body language, speech patterns, or energy level, they unconsciously feel more comfortable around you. It's called the **Chameleon Effect**, and researchers have found it increases likability big time.

If they're speaking softly and slowly, don't come in loud and hyper. If they're animated and gesturing wildly, match that energy. This doesn't mean being a copycat weirdo. It's about creating rapport through similarity. Humans are tribal creatures. We trust people who seem like us.

Try it next time you're talking to someone. Lean in when they lean in. Match their tone. Watch how the conversation flows smoother.

**Step 3: Use Their Name (But Don't Overdo It)**

Carnegie nailed this too: a person's name is the sweetest sound to them. Using someone's name in conversation triggers positive feelings. It shows you care enough to remember it and makes the interaction feel personal.

But here's the trick, don't be that person who says their name every other sentence like some creepy salesperson. Drop it naturally once or twice during a conversation. ""That's a great point, Sarah."" Or ""I totally get what you mean, Mike.""

Small move, huge impact.

**Step 4: Give Genuine Compliments (Not BS Flattery)**

There's a difference between compliments and ass-kissing. People can tell when you're blowing smoke. The key is to compliment something **specific** that shows you actually noticed them.

Instead of ""You're so smart,"" try ""I love how you explained that concept, it made everything click for me."" Instead of ""Nice shirt,"" go with ""That color really suits you, where'd you get it?""

Specific compliments feel sincere. Generic ones feel like you're working an angle. And according to research from Stanford psychologist Robert Cialdini's book ""Influence,"" genuine compliments activate the reciprocity principle. When you make someone feel good, they're wired to want to return the favor.

**Step 5: Be Vulnerable (Not Weak)**

This might sound backwards, but showing vulnerability actually makes you MORE likable. Researcher Brené Brown talks about this extensively in her work. When you share something real, a small struggle, a mistake you made, a fear, it breaks down walls. People connect with authenticity, not perfection.

But there's a balance. Don't trauma dump on someone you just met. Share something relatable and human without making it heavy. ""Man, I totally bombed that presentation last week, learned my lesson about practicing"" hits different than pretending you're flawless.

Vulnerability builds trust. Trust builds likability.

**Step 6: Make Them Feel Good About Themselves**

Here's the ugly truth about human psychology: people like you more when they feel good around you. It's not about making them laugh, although that helps. It's about creating positive associations.

Psychologist Robert Zajonc called this the **mere exposure effect**. The more someone sees you in positive contexts, the more they like you. So be the person who brings good energy. Don't gossip. Don't complain constantly. Don't drain people with negativity.

When you leave a conversation, they should feel lighter, not exhausted.

If you want to go deeper into social psychology and communication strategies, there's a personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books like Carnegie's work, Cialdini's research, and expert insights on influence and relationships. 

You can set a goal like ""become more magnetic in conversations"" or ""build authentic connections as an introvert,"" and it creates a structured learning plan tailored specifically to your personality and challenges. The app turns these insights into customized audio sessions, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and context. You can adjust the voice too, some people go for something energetic during commutes, others prefer a calmer tone before bed. Makes it way easier to absorb this stuff while doing laundry or hitting the gym instead of just bookmarking articles you'll never read.

**Step 7: Remember Small Details**

You know what makes someone feel valued? When you remember that small thing they mentioned three weeks ago. ""Hey, how did your sister's wedding go?"" or ""Did you ever finish that book you were reading?""

This is next level stuff. Most people are so caught up in their own heads they don't retain details. When YOU do, it signals that you genuinely care. It's rare, and people notice.

Keep mental notes or jot down details after conversations if you need to. This isn't creepy, it's thoughtful.

**Step 8: The Power of Silence**

Silence makes people uncomfortable, so they fill it. And when they fill it, they often reveal more about themselves. Don't be afraid of pauses in conversation. Let them breathe. Let the other person think and respond fully.

Chris Voss talks about this in ""Never Split the Difference."" He's a former FBI hostage negotiator, and even he uses silence as a tool. It shows confidence and gives space for deeper connection.

Plus, people who don't dominate every second of conversation are way more likable. Nobody likes a conversation hog.

**Step 9: Show Up Consistently**

Likability isn't built in one conversation. It's built over time through consistency. If you say you'll text someone, text them. If you promise to grab coffee, follow through. Reliability is sexy. It shows you're not just flaky or fake.

The book ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear talks about how small, consistent actions compound over time. The same applies to relationships. Show up. Be present. Don't ghost people. The cumulative effect is massive.

**Step 10: Stop Seeking Approval**

This is the ultimate paradox. The less you need people to like you, the more they will. Desperation repels. Confidence attracts.

When you're comfortable with who you are, flaws and all, people feel that energy. You're not performing for validation. You're just existing authentically. And that's magnetic as hell.

Mark Manson talks about this in ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck."" Stop caring so much about what everyone thinks. Ironically, that's when people start gravitating toward you.

**Final Word**

Making people like you isn't about tricks or manipulation. It's about understanding what makes humans tick and showing up as your genuine, interested, and thoughtful self. Listen more than you talk. Remember details. Be consistent. Don't try so hard. And for the love of everything, stop being fake.

It gives me ADHD-like symptoms and obsessive compulsive thoughts to specifically watch porn,I never had that when I wasn't on caffeine.

I had periods where I did give it up for a few days or weeks and the urges were non-existent,but always found a way to fool myself to back to energy drinks again because ""it amplified my Nofap benefits and emotions""(yeah I was stupid I know).

One way to deal with that caffeine high was nicotine,I only started vaping a month ago and it was easier to abstain from porn,but the intrussive thoughts from caffeine reducing the bloodflow from my brain always caused me to have ""boring relapses"" (where you don't feel like masturbating but you do it anyway,again the intrussive thoughts).

I'm spiraling, a little. I've got all the Epstien files on my thumbdrive, and I'm unzipping them, mind you, I'm very easily distracted, and usually I'm busy telling cam girls or whatever to fuck right the fuck off in the kindest way possible (It's a late night hobby I picked up when games don't cut the mustard.)

But.... the news cycle, right,? Just dump, after dump, after dump of randomly paced news about ICE, Trump, Maga, the Grams, Superbowl, what I should be angry at, what I shouldn't, the Stranger things, Iron lung, palworld, pokemon, digital soul and any number of other things I happen to be somewhat focused on a t the moment.

My main thing here is that usually I'm super fucking logical about a bunch of shit, but lately, after a marathon sesh of play Upload Labs and supermarket simulator, a few random thoughts occured to me. These weren't the usual systems designs or unused upgrade plans or mod things I usually have and thanks to a double dosage of 200mg caffine pills with a cup of coffee, it's just now dawning on me that I haven't really vented. 

True venting, no ai to disect things or preexplain the explanation, nor a community that tells me my ideas are dumb because of whatever reason, but rather just venting for the fucking sake of venting.

Mind you, I don't really talk to anyone, and blogging has always been kind of there for me to mentally vomit onto a blank white space and call it a day.

But what am I supposed to follow in order to get sometraction? Why do I feel constantly isolated when it comes to getting any kind of attention of support for the projects or stories I'm working on?

Gpt would usually tell me that I'm working on a level others don't operate at, but I'm pretty sure there ARE others that operate at my level, or even beyond. My spurts of random brain glitches are useful from tiem to time, but I often find it hard to relate to others. Maybe I'm not focused enough? Or edgey enough? Or people in general don't really know how to relate to me?

I've explored this time and again, and the fact that it still takes an ai to tell just what the fuck is up because I don't quite understand does take a little while to process. Maybe I'm just one of the folks people are supposed to ignore until something amazing happens? 

If that's the case it kinda sucks that thats the worlds plan for me and people like me.

""Oh sure, you're the sperm that won, but you're the human that'll lose till you win.""

Fucking what? 

Like, seriously, am I supposed to just fucking stumble around, tripping over my dick till I stumble around for a light switch that's never supposed to be there in the firstp lace? Am I just one of the few lucky losers that never really gets their shit together and winds up at the bottom of a ditch somewhere because they spent too much time having crisis after crisis?

Told you... inconsistent, unfocused, unbothered by the ways of the world. I spent so much time being angry at a bunch of different things that I never figured out how to actually take care of myself nor find ways to provide for myself. 

So... I might be kind of fucked if I'm unable to find work... which is also a bummer, since I tend to just do my own thing and isolate myself most of the time from the outside world, which, somehow turns me into a bit of a loser.... unseen, unheard, unwanted, and unloved, ah the life of a street mime that also doubles as a band poster on a wall no one pays much attention to.

But am I philosopher? A creator? An architect? Am I just a show? A shadow? A blinking light of society that emits a light but no one bothers to really explore the source of that light?

I wonder about a lot of things, and yeah, I don't really tighten the circle or touch on anything anyone can grasp on to really express one opinion or another... maybe that's my problem... is that I'm too nuetral, too little, too small in my words.

Though, previously explored notions of polysyllabic vabularies have often left others feeling lost in translation, as though they aren't able to ocmprehend or even bother, in the slightest, to educate themselves or reach out.

Maybe I'm too complex that the varied complexity becomes a bothersome task in its own right and folks would rather move forward i ntheir own mundanity then to be the least bit interested in some of the random findings....

I dunno, maybe I'm just some muddied cloud of random thoughts, and that AI is the only real way I can relate to the world without being bogged down by the varied inconsequential weight of it all. But.... that makes me sound cold, distant, egotistical, doesn't it? Like I'm the villain of some b roll movie that never got produced or green lit and so it just sits there, people and producers passing it by without giving it a second look, as though thep lots contained within the film itself were witnessed one too many times, and despite the grandier or complexity of the many intertwinging plots, in the end, they all just weave the simplest of tales?

I don't know how to relate to others, and maybe that's both my greatest strength and weakness at the same time? Like a double edged sword.... maybe I've purposefully isolated myself from others for so long as a way to protect myself from the endless criticisms of my roomates that I've somehow forgotten to social... or even attempt to reconnect? Could be that... maybe its that.

I dunno if its that. Could be something else?

But that'd mean that despite my best efforts of keeping it simple, to the best of my ability at least, I don't really know how to do anything of great worth, or maybe I downplay the importance of various aspects of my psychology that it seems to others that I'm crying out with an open hand looking for answers that were never there, and those people who do look me in the eyes, only see someone crying wolf or clamoring for some kind of pity...

But the bitterness of mankind, in this day and age seems to carrywithin it its own kind of poison, doesn't it?

There's no place for philosophers in this day and age, as those without any actual bite lose their potential spotlight forever, remaining as unknown as the memory of the day before in the minutes before waking up.... I overthink a lot... high anxiety and all that. But relaxing is a problem as well, as though I'm consistently trapped in an endless nightmare, saying one thing while walking in the opposite direction of the challenges that come before me.

Does that make me cowardly or wise? Intuitive or avoidant? Risk averse or overly cautious? What does it all mean in the end? Half my life whittled away by time and tide and yet for all the accomplishments within my own achieved, there's little accolades to my name, as though the days of glory are behind me and there are no more dragons to slay... Or maybe, like Quixote... I've been slashing away at windmills for too long... pretending the giant in their places were attacking some kind of village. But there was never a village in danger, nor giants to slay, no hidden rescue...

What does that mean for me? That I've lived so long in my own head as a way to redact the dialy horrors and traumas and stresses that I endure and encounter that my own imagination, as limitless as it could be, acts as a prison unto its owner?

Weird. Huh? To say so much, yet never really understand what it all means.... to be a part of so many communities yet never know exactly what to say, or to be on the right track when momentum is obviously pulling in the opposite direction...

I've recently decided to pull the trigger on an espresso machine, and I got myself a pretty good deal for an after display Delonghi Dedica Arte. Long story short, I had some crappy omni roast I used to get the hang of it all, and we did mostly single shots for practice, and after I got to a point where it wasn't terrible I oredered some nice coffee from a roastery I like.

Coffee arrives, I pulled a shot with the settings I liked and it was a decent shot, bit harsh, bit acidic, but it was enjoyable. I then used lower temp and finer grind, definitely a smoother shot, just a bit flatter somehow. The next time I pulled a double shot I used a grinder setting sitting between the last 2 shots, everything is the same, but I pulled a double shot and it was craptastic, akin to that omni roast I had. Clearly I did something wrong, wet puck, ultra sour, maybe I tamped wrong, maybe double shot basket isn't twice as big and theres was just too much coffee (this one is more voluminous). Next time I used 2g less, I guess it's better but still pretty bad, and it doesn't feel like there were too mamy grounds in the basket. My gf has the same issue. I tried tamping harder, tamping lighter, I'm kind of at a loss here. There's such a huge difference between single and double shot with absolutely the same ratios. My idea is to go do 14g, see if it's just too much coffee in the basket, since 16g still felt like kind of a lot, but at that point it's hardly a double shot if single is 9g.

At the same time, single shots also just fell off in quality. They're still much better, but the last shots I pulled were fine for cappuccino, but not good enough for pure espresso. I'm gonna try to use identical ratios to the 1st shot for scientific reasons, I need to see if I can replicate it, but it still feels like I'm missing something.

Anyone has some tips about what I might be missing? Or had a similar experience with dedica? I'm good with pourover, but this is my 1st rodeo with espresso

My previous post where I talk about this is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pzq2ih/gerd\_not\_helped\_by\_ppis\_thinking\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pzq2ih/gerd_not_helped_by_ppis_thinking_about/)



The diet I finally decided on was this:

* potatoes
* white fish
* salmon
* chicken breast 
* carrots
* courgette
* olive oil
* herbal teas (rooibos, ginger, chamomile)



I didn’t add anything else at all apart from salt, and I didn’t have any alcohol or caffeine at all. My only ‘cheat’ was having a steak a couple of times because the opportunity came up and I thought it had a very low likelihood of causing any problems.



I have had a bit of improvement (I’ve been trying to track my symptoms as carefully as I can) but it’s only been a slight change really. Normally I’d be inclined to continue on this diet for another month or two and hope that the symptoms continue to slowly improve, but since I have a very busy March lined up in terms of travelling (both for work and holidays) and I know it’s gonna be impossible to keep to a diet anywhere near as strict as I have been, I feel like it makes sense to use February to gradually introduce some foods to try and get some idea of what is and isn’t a trigger for me.



So what I’m trying to decide now is what foods I should try and introduce first. These are the options I’m thinking of:



* Eggs - Would be good to have another protein source to make things a bit more varied, this should also be quite an easily available food when I’m travelling
* Oats - I feel like this would be a good one to add some fibre, also would make things a bit easier when travelling
* Some other vegetables (broccoli, spinach, cabbage) - I feel like it’d be a good idea to get some variety of vegetables nutrition wise
* Berries (blueberries, raspberries) - Would be good for fibre and for micronutrients
* Coffee - Yeah, maybe this is less important nutrition-wise, but tbh this is what I’ve missed the most so I’m inclined to try and reintroduce this as soon as I can
* Anything else? I think I’ll probably leave alcohol and dairy for now, although when I’m on holiday in March I probably won’t be 100% strict with these

1qwimmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qwimmw/should_i_consider_divroce/,Should I consider divroce?,"Hi, first time posting here, and I would love to hear from people who have gone through anything similar.

I have been married to my husband for almost three years. From the moment I met him, I told him that I am not close with my family and that I rarely ever see them. He had a lot of back and forth with me about this, saying I might not be a good partner for him because he loves seeing his family and I’m not close with mine. Anyway, we got past this because he said that once he gets married, he expects to see them once a week in the summer. I had no issues with this. For context, we live around a 5hour flight away from them.

Since we got married, we moved to another continent. His parents visit us for the whole month and stay in our apartment. Our apartment is not big, only two bedrooms. In the summer, my husband wants me to go with him and spend another close to a month at their house. We do everything together breakfast, lunch, dinner, and walks. Maybe four times, just me and my husband, we will go for a coffee alone in the village, but then his father most of the time will come out to find us so he can have coffee with us.

I feel like my bucket has overflowed and I cannot take it anymore. It is not cultural, by the way. They come to our apartment and they don’t want to shower, they smell and are very difficult. They never wash their clothes and smell almost like they are homeless people. They moan about the food we eat and make comments. They say they would get rid of half of my kitchen items if this was their kitchen and make stupid comments. They don’t put their dirty dishes in the dishwasher. They go onto the balcony with socks, bring all the dust inside, and then get mad at me when I ask them not to do that.

The father demands that he sit in the front seat in the car when it’s four of us, and I sit in the back-and this is how it is. My husband will not dare to go against his father. When my husband is driving, his father tells him off and shouts at him if he doesn’t like his driving, like he is a child, and my husband just laughs like a little baby and does not stand up to him. But when it comes to me, and when I tell my husband that I don’t like things, he is pretty harsh towards me, has a big running mouth, and is not afraid to grab my hand or wrist and pull me.

My husband does not see anything wrong with his parents behaviour, and I am the one who gets blamed when I try to speak with him. According to him, his parents are great, they mean no harm, and he does a lot of stuff for me. When I ask him what exactly he does for me, his answer is driving me to x place, like he is my slave. He supports both of us whilist I am searching for a job. Whenever there is an argument, he always brings up how he drives me to x place or drove me in the past. I stopped asking him to drive me to places a long time ago because of this exact reason.



This morning, my friend visited me and my in-laws were around. Instead of saying hello, they sat with us and literally acted like my friend came to visit them. I was supposed to give something to my friend and my MIL said, “Give this to her,” and I said no, I cannot give  it to her after you cut it. She then turned to my friend, made a stupid facial expression, and said, “Don’t listen to her,” meaning me.

Whenever my in-laws are visiting, my husband and I end up having massive arguments. We are unable to talk to each other in peace because his mother listens to everything. If we go to our bedroom, my husband does not want to talk because he is tired, I give him anxiety by expressing my feelings, or I annoy him. On top of that, he does not want his parents to be alone.

My husband tells his parents how much money he makes, how much money we have, what he is doing with the money, and where we are investing it. But he lies to me and says he does not tell them this. His mum told me that John (my husband)  will have a certain amount of money in five years, that John’s car is very nice, John this or John that. Basically, it feels like I am nobody and that I own nothing.  
Once his mother told me that he went to his brother’s house and had been talking against me- my own husband. Whenever we had disagreements in the past, he always ran to his brother and sister-in-law, so I would not be surprised if he trashed me in front of them.

I do not work at the moment as I have lost my job, but I am searching for one. On top of everything else, my husband decided to take them travelling with us. I agreed as long as they did their own things, but now my husband is going against what we agreed. After all these events, I asked my husband to book a hotel room just for us, as initially we booked an Airbnb for all four of us. They are spending a few weeks in our apartment and even more time in the rented Airbnb. I don’t like it and I need my own space.



My husband is difficult and accuses me of always being a downer and asks what is wrong with me as my behavour is not normal. He says I give him anxiety. Basically, I have to keep my mouth shut and deal with his parents. Because his friends’ wives are doing it, why shouldn’t I? Bear in mind, his friends’ parents are much nicer, so I am not surprised they are not against spending time with their in-laws. The other two daughters-in-law don’t like them and barely see them, never mind spending weeks with them.

We are both 33 and have no kids (which I am thankful for, as I am not having a child in this situation).



Deep inside, I regret marrying him. My previous partners were nothing like this. They accepted me the way I was when it came to family. Things didn’t work out for other reasons, but they never let their parents or anyone walk all over me the way my husband does. My husband keeps telling me I am an unhappy individual, a downer, and that something is wrong with me. I hate my whole life when his parents are around. I have asked him to book them a hotel so they don’t stay in our apartment, but he never does.



I don’t think he will ever change, and I am considering divorce. I spoke with a few of my friends and they do not think it is normal to spend this much time together. I can’t go into full detail with them because I don’t want them to know everything. My friend keep asking me why your husband is allowing this x, y, x and i have no words to reply. I want to cry and scream. 

Am I really sich a downer and crazy individual or am I being manupulated by my own husband?

As the lines between traditional banking and crypto payments continue to blur, stablecoin cards are emerging as one of the most anticipated fintech trends of 2026. According to a recent forecast by Dragonfly general partner Tom Schmidt, the coming year could mark a turning point where stablecoins stop being just a blockchain feature - and start becoming a daily payment tool in physical and digital commerce.

# From wallets to cards: A leap in crypto usability

Until now, stablecoins like USDC and USDT have mostly lived in crypto wallets, used for savings, remittances, or DeFi. But as more consumers demand practical ways to spend their crypto, the focus is shifting to real-world usability. Visa and Mastercard have already piloted stablecoin integrations, and several fintech players are racing to issue debit-style cards that let users pay directly from stablecoin balances.

Why is this such a big deal? It’s about bridging Web3 and Web2 - giving users the ability to use stablecoins in everyday situations without complex onboarding. Whether it’s paying for coffee, booking travel, or covering freelance bills, stablecoin cards could dramatically accelerate the adoption of crypto payments.

# What this means for crypto payment platforms

For crypto payment gateways, this shift represents both opportunity and responsibility. Enabling businesses to accept and settle stablecoin payments is no longer enough - the infrastructure must also support seamless outflows, recurring payouts, and real-time transactions that mirror card payment behavior.

[Sheepy.com](http://Sheepy.com) already equips merchants with tools for accepting stablecoins and automating mass payouts. With card-based stablecoin spending set to surge, having flexible, reliable crypto rails will be key for staying competitive in the evolving digital payment landscape.

# A year of stablecoin usability

If 2024-2025 were about regulation and infrastructure, 2026 may be the year stablecoins finally go mainstream at checkout counters. For businesses, it’s time to adapt. For users, it’s time to swipe.

Do you see stablecoin cards replacing traditional debit cards, or will they stay a niche tool for crypto-native users?",1,1770290011.0,Sheepy_crypto,0,1.0,False

1qwihf4,https://i.redd.it/1vi4e5pbsnhg1.jpeg,Did cycling from Dombivli to Marine Drive Mumbai- 50km+ (Storytime),"I do cycling frequently in a few weeks, so randomly me and my friend decided to cycle from Dombivli to Marines.

Before this ride, my longest ride was just 18km, was a bit unsure about how the ride would go since we are not professional cyclists with road cycles.

The cycle I have is Cosmic’s MTB in which most of it’s gears are not operational, and MTBs are usually 10-15kg heavier than normal road bikes which usually cyclists use.

Still we did start the ride as decided, the first 20 km were the easiest, speed was decent around (18-19kmph), the traffic was less since we started the ride early morning at 6 AM.

Then the 20-30km point was the moderate part… since we were riding on flat surfaces. The speed dropped a bit, starting to feel the leg muscles a bit. Had some water and sugary food and continued the ride.

Around the 40Km we took a break to have breakfast at Ramashrey in Sion, had some Thatte Idli and Dosa, Filter Coffee, Pineapple Sheera turned out to be new fav dish in my list (Ik this part is useless info but still sharing it )

Then the final 10Km was when I actually started feeling my legs muscles getting pumped, still we could maintain the pace around 10-15kmph and reached Marines finally.

It was a fun experience, would like to do it again in sometime.

Would love to know if you guys have any more place recommendations which I can go by cycling, drop it in the comments!

TL;DR: My biological father died at birth, and my mother resented me for it, treating me as a slave and a scapegoat while favoring my half-brothers. I endured extreme physical and psychological abuse (beatings, isolation, starvation of affection) and developed coping mechanisms including self-harm, over-exercising, and hypersexuality. She financially exploited me by stealing my inheritance and forcing me into university just to collect government payments. I was discarded the moment the money stopped, and I am now navigating life with CPTSD, BPD, and severe emotional regulation issues.

(I did use Gemini AI to try and fix punctuation errors only) 

The Beginning
When I say I’ve had a shit run, it’s pretty much been from the get-go.
I never knew my biological father because he died less than 24 hours after I was born. The story is that he lost control of his motorcycle and hit a tree when he came off the bike. (I found out in my teens that that was the ""official"" story. But the reality was that he was racing with a friend of his and they got too close, accidentally knocked his bike and caused him to crash. Because they didn't have a license, they rode off and left him there.)
Anyways, my mum was 18 at the time, and within 24 hours she went from the happiest she had ever been, to completely destroyed. It broke something inside of her. Not long after his funeral, she found out he had been cheating on her with multiple other women as well.
For the first 6 months of my life, I was essentially raised by both sets of grandparents. My mother went off clubbing, partying, sleeping around, and going on holidays. When she took me back she was on a lot of antidepressants (but they actually made her even more violent and aggressive).
My stepdad got into the picture when I was about 2 and a half. They had 2 more kids (my half-brothers) but he treated me like his own son. However, he was very much ""old fashioned""—he worked, came home, expected dinner on the table, and to be left alone to do his own thing afterward. So, my mum became a controlled domestic housewife, which only made her anger issues even worse.
The Abuse

See, she never treated me the same as my brothers. I always angered her the quickest (when I was in my teens she told me I reminded her of my dad, so that's why I was treated differently).
Most kids get told off or spanked when they misbehaved. I got punched, kicked, thrown into walls, choked, and I’d get pinned to the floor with her on top of me hitting me repeatedly with a belt or wooden spoon. I even got pushed down a flight of stairs in my teens. And it could be anything from actually misbehaving to playing too loudly, being up too early, annoying my brothers, or getting annoyed at them.
There were times where she’d either make me go to her closet and choose which belt she would hit me with, or she’d let my brothers choose. There were times where she’d drag me from under my bed and hit me repeatedly.
I’d be forced to sit facing a wall, with my legs crossed and my nose/forehead pressed against it. If I looked away she would make me sit there longer, and it could be up to half an hour to an hour at a time. She’d lock me in my room, remove the door handles so I couldn't get out, even if I peed myself. She’d leave me in there until she was ready to let me out. And if I had peed myself, she would usually resort to physical violence as well.
And this was all before I was even 10 years old.

The Punishments
In 4th grade, I got a bad report card, so my punishment was simple: No technology, no toys, no family movie night, no TV at dinner. I got my own table and own chair facing a wall. If I looked at the TV, I’d get an additional punishment on top.
Every day after school I sat at the dinner table, did any allocated homework, and then had to write lines or copy books word for word. I also didn't get dessert after dinner. And this happened every day, until my grades improved. Which wouldn't be known until I got my next report card, 3 months later.
My grades never dropped again; I actually never got a grade lower than 85% from that point on.
Eventually, my mother divorced my dad, but he was still smitten over her. Even though we saw him every weekend, her punishments extended there too, and he would enforce them.

Escalation and The Failed Escape
After she divorced him it only got worse. She mixed her pills with alcohol, drugs, and sleeping pills. She only got even more aggressive and abusive, and she ended up getting involved with bikies. To ""toughen"" me up, she would force me into the gym at home, put on her boxing gloves and just start punching me, expecting me to learn to defend myself, or she’d pit me against my brothers while she watched.
At 13, I tried to run away from home. I stayed with my biological grandparents, went to court, all that stuff. I had DHS supervise visits to my mum's house where she showed off a fridge and pantry full of food and snacks we never had previously. She showed off a bedroom that was decorated and full of toys, a computer and gaming consoles (stuff that I didn't have before).
After a few weeks, I was ordered by the courts to return back home. I returned to an empty bedroom and was told that I had betrayed her, so I needed to earn everything back.
Years later she told me she had bikie-funded barristers representing her, and she had slept with the corrupt police sergeant that was overseeing my case to make sure she got me back. She cut off contact with my biological grandparents because of their involvement.

Isolation and Slavery
As for my social life, it was non-existent. I didn't have a phone, wasn't allowed to visit friends—not even for their birthdays or my own—and wasn't allowed to have Facebook or any form of social media/messaging apps either. She rarely attended family events either, so the only socialization I ever received was at school during school hours only. I walked to and from school, but she had timed how long it took me, so if I was late for any reason, I got punished.
I was isolated, so I spent a lot of my time just reading, self-reflecting, and just stewing in my own emotions and thoughts. My therapist/psychologists think this is what contributed to what is assumed to be a higher-than-average IQ.
At home, I was—in her own words—her slave. I made her coffee whenever she wanted it, cooked dinner, cleaned up afterward, vacuumed, mowed lawns, folded laundry. If I so much as sighed, I was grounded, verbally or physically abused, or a combination of all. Whatever she felt like in the moment.

Coping Mechanisms: Technology
When I finally got an iPad, that was my only form of socialization. I found ways to hide messaging apps, so I managed to meet people online and talk to a few friends. But at the same time, if I was grounded, the iPad was the first thing I had to hand over.
The problem was that this was one of my few coping mechanisms and links to the outside world. I ran my Kik group, I talked to strangers, and I also used to help friends through their own personal problems and relationship issues (I didn't have a relationship of my own but for some reason, I just seemed to know what to do).
The problem is if I was grounded all that control and contact ceased and I was left in panic mode. I’d suddenly lost contact with these people and they had no idea why I’d just disappeared. My Kik group would fall into chaos, and friends who were in the middle of emotional breakdowns or depressive episodes were left abandoned. It put me under immense amounts of stress. Obviously, I couldn't tell my parents what I was up to or that I did have access to messaging platforms or it would have been even worse.

Coping Mechanisms: Physical Pain
Anyway, by the time I was 16 I was actively working out. I was fit, I worked out 3 hours a day, every day. But it wasn't to be healthy or fit; it was, according to my therapist, actually a form of self-harm and emotional regulation. I’d deliberately play music that would either upset or anger me, and would push my body as far as it could go until I was so physically exhausted and sore that I’d just pass out.
By this point in time, my sparring matches with my brothers were completely one-sided. Even with both of them against me at the same time I’d still come out on top, so she’d get my stepdad to take me down instead.
It wasn't until one random day when she pushed me against a wall and tried to choke me that all the physical abuse stopped. Apparently, she tried to choke me, and rather than actually choke and submit, I smiled, puffed up my chest, and tensed my body. Apparently, the look in my eye actually made her feel like I was about to tear her apart; it scared her enough to never try to physically dominate me again.
But the verbal and emotional abuse still continued.
Along with overworking my body, I also self-harmed. Not because I wanted to end my life or because I was depressed... it was another weird coping mechanism I’d developed. I’d bottle up my emotions, and when I finally needed a release I’d let it all out in a controlled and private explosion.
I’d take a razor from a brand new pencil sharpener, and I’d just start slashing at my body. No clean organized cuts, it was completely random and totally chaotic slashing over my legs, chest, stomach, arms. I’d never go too deep, never near veins, and always quick slashes, so fast and with such a sharp razor that I didn't even feel the cuts. I’d do it until I was simply too tired to continue. As I was doing it I didn't ""feel"". It's only when I stopped that I did—the warmth, the burn. And as sick as it sounds, I’d savor it, I liked it.
I’d clean and disinfect my razor, have a blistering hot shower to intensify the pain. Watch my body and the water turn red as each cut wept. And then I’d go to bed, lay down, and feel my body just radiate heat until I passed out. I unleashed my anger and pain onto myself so that I didn't unleash it on someone else.
One day she saw a cut on my arm. She made me strip in front of her and my stepdad, told me I was a disappointment, weak, and that next time I should make sure I cut myself right and just end it—at least my younger brothers weren't weak and pathetic.

Coping Mechanisms: Hypersexuality
Then there was the NSFW stuff. I started masturbating when I was 9, watching porn not too long after (had access to a computer at my dad's house, mine eventually, and then my iPad).
I started sexting with strangers on Omegle, Kik, Snapchat, Reddit. Sexual release felt good; it was one of the few things that made me feel good. The people I talked to, whether they were grooming me or not... seemed like the only people that actually cared about me and wanted me to feel good, so I just wanted more and more of it. It spiraled into an addiction where I was and still am just chasing that dopamine.

Financial Exploitation
But that's not the end of the abuse, no no. See here's the thing.
When my dad died my mother received an insurance payout, his superannuation, and another payout which was supposed to A) be locked away and given to me on my 18th birthday, or B) used to support me as I grew up. My mother chose option B. On top of that, she would also receive single parenting payments and ongoing payments from VTAC until I A) turned 18 or B) finished my education, whichever occurred last. (A gap year between high school and uni would void this so it would count as me finishing my education in high school... important in a second).
So my mother was financially stable. She also received single parenting payments for my two brothers as well. When I was 16 and started receiving AusStudy payments she took 50% as rent.
She pushed me to go to university right after high school and refused to let me leave when I realized it wasn't what I wanted to do anymore. I didn't know if I stopped then so would her payments... she only wanted me to go to university so she could keep getting paid. In the end, it killed my passion for art, and I now have a $100,000 HECS debt for the courses. If I tried to quit she would threaten and abuse me... and even though I was 19/20 and physically stronger than her, I was afraid. So I finished my courses.
As soon as I graduated she gave me permission to leave home. She even packed up my stuff and I moved in with my now-wife. I was no longer bringing in the money, so I was no longer needed.
The thing is, even though she never worked, and we had money, we never saw it. My brothers and I ate Home Brand food, cheap food, and quick and easy dinners. We never went on school camps, never went on excursions, and never got takeout. We bought 2nd hand school books and had to buy our own clothes with money we got from birthdays and Christmas, etc.
All while she bought designer clothes, bags, shoes, partied on weekends, and went on holidays. I was essentially her paycheck; she admitted she despised my dad, and because I reminded her of him, she resented me too.

The Aftermath
Thanks to all that, I’ve got CPTSD, depression, anxiety, BPD. It's assumed I have a higher than average IQ, and I am probably on the spectrum.
I find it difficult to empathize with other people's emotions because I can't process or at times even feel my own, so I don't know how to react sometimes. I find it difficult to recognize or understand social cues. Things like death leave me appearing cold and unfeeling because I don't seem upset, unfeeling and don't seem to react like a normal person would.
I go through periods of having 0 emotion and feeling. I have over the years learnt how to act normal to ""blend in"" and be more socially acceptable. But I also have periods of time where I'm just so overcome with emotions and hyper-sensitive that I feel overwhelmed and like I'm drowning. I slip into a huge depressive state and essentially break down. My libido becomes non-existent and I just spiral.
Usually, this ends in a period of complete emotionlessness, my libido skyrockets even worse than my usual, and I essentially become insatiable. But once it all plateaus and stabilizes I return to MY normal state.

Fact Sheet

[2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial - United States Department of State](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/2026-critical-minerals-ministerial)

https://preview.redd.it/okci7m3qknhg1.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f9111e8cb192e536993f4630be3264ffce26853

* Today the United States, together with our partners and allies, has set out to reshape the global market for critical minerals and rare earths. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, joined by Vice President JD Vance, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, hosted representatives of 54 countries and the European Commission, including 43 foreign and other ministers, at the [2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPI33yvFtI).
* Delegations from the following countries attended: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Cook Islands, the Czech Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, the European Commission, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guinea, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, the Netherlands, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, and Zambia.
* Critical minerals and rare earths are essential for our most advanced technologies and will only become more important as AI, robotics, batteries, and autonomous devices transform our economies. Today, this market is highly concentrated, leaving it a tool of political coercion and supply chain disruption, putting our core interests at risk. We will build new sources of supply, foster secure and reliable transport and logistics networks, and transform the global market into one that is secure, diversified, and resilient, end-to-end.
* At today’s Ministerial, the United States and our partners took action to build secure and resilient critical mineral supply chains. In one day, the United States signed new bilateral critical minerals frameworks and memorandums of understanding (MOUs), announced U.S. government financing opportunities to support strategic minerals projects, and celebrated the launch of the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE). These efforts are complemented by our collaboration between the United States and its nine Pax Silica partners to secure strategic stacks of the global technology supply chain.
* Today, the United States signed eleven new bilateral critical minerals frameworks or MOUs with countries, including Argentina, the Cook Islands, Ecuador, Guinea, Morocco, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan. The United States signed ten other critical mineral frameworks or MOUs in the past five months and reached completion of negotiations on such agreements with seventeen other countries. The United States is demonstrating unprecedented leadership in critical minerals diplomacy. These frameworks lay the groundwork for nations to collaborate on pricing challenges, spur development, create fair markets, close gaps in priority supply chains, and expand access to financing.
* Secretary Rubio announced the creation of FORGE as the successor to the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). FORGE, which will be chaired by the Republic of Korea through June, will lead with bold and decisive action to address ongoing challenges in the global critical minerals marketplace. Understanding the benefits of working together and building on the MSP, FORGE partners will collaborate at the policy and project levels to advance initiatives that strengthen diversified, resilient, and secure critical minerals supply chains.
* Recognizing that governments alone cannot solve this problem, we are committed to close partnership with the private sector, including through Pax Silica, which will lead through investments in mining, refining and processing, end use applications, and recycling and reprocessing. On February 3, the day before the ministerial, we brought leading lights in the private sector together with governments from around the world to discuss supply chain challenges and investment opportunities. That day, Deputy Secretary Landau witnessed the signing of an MOU between Glencore and the U.S.-backed Orion Critical Mineral Consortium in relation to a potential acquisition of assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This MOU reflects the core objectives of the U.S.-DRC Strategic Partnership Agreement by encouraging greater U.S. investment in the DRC’s mining sector and promoting secure, reliable, and mutually beneficial flows of copper and cobalt to the United States from the DRC. Following the ministerial on February 4, Deputy Secretary Landau and Under Secretary Helberg convened a task force of mining industry leaders to advance priority projects in the framework of new collaboration with the United States and its partners.
* The U.S. Government is mobilizing unprecedented resources to secure critical mineral supply chains, supporting projects with more than $30 billion in letters of interest, investments, loans, and other support over the past six months in partnership with the private sector. These investments, along with Pax Silica and our reinvigorated diplomatic and commercial engagement driven by America First values, are having a multiplier effect, mobilizing private capital many times greater than the U.S. government outlay, which will generate billions of dollars in new projects to secure our supply chains. These coordinated efforts span domestic and international projects, strengthening U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. Under the Trump Administration, America is leading the global race for strategic minerals and advanced manufacturing. This is only the beginning—dozens of additional projects are in the pipeline undergoing due diligence by U.S. funding agencies, with more coming online soon.

U.S. Government support for critical mineral supply chains in the recent past includes:

**Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)**

On February 2nd, President Trump announced Project Vault, a landmark initiative led by the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), which marks an unprecedented step in U.S. industrial policy by establishing a domestic strategic reserve for critical minerals. The EXIM Board of Directors approved a Direct Loan of up to $10 billion for Project Vault, more than double the largest financing in EXIM’s history, designed to shield domestic manufacturers from supply shocks, expand U.S. production and processing of critical raw materials, and fundamentally strengthen America’s critical minerals sector.

More broadly, over the past year, EXIM has issued $14.8 billion in Letters of Interest for critical minerals projects under the Trump Administration, including, in recent months, $455 million for rare earth development and processing in the United States; $400 million for lithium extraction in Arkansas; $350 million for cobalt and nickel production in Australia; and $215 million for tin extraction across the United Kingdom and Australia.

EXIM’s critical minerals portfolio of authorized transactions includes:

# Feb. 5th, 2026~How US Project Vault challenges China's rare-earth dominance

*Donald Trump's Project Vault seeks to secure US access to rare‑earth minerals vital for advanced tech and clean energy. The EU wants a minerals alliance with Washington, but can they really shift China's outsized lead?*

[How US Project Vault challenges China's rare-earth dominance](https://www.dw.com/en/how-us-project-vault-challenges-chinas-rare-earth-dominance/a-75795283)

A flurry of announcements this week is reshaping efforts by the [United States](https://www.dw.com/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189) and the [European Union](https://www.dw.com/en/european-union-eu/t-17440066) to loosen [China's](https://www.dw.com/en/china/t-18480887) grip on [rare‑earth minerals](https://www.dw.com/en/rare-earth-elements/t-64385013), the building blocks of next-generation technology.

US President [Donald Trump](https://www.dw.com/en/us-president-donald-trump-russia-ukraine-israel-gaza-tariffs-trade-war/t-19434433) on Monday unveiled Project Vault, a plan to build a US strategic stockpile of critical minerals, expand domestic rare-earth processing capacity and secure long‑term supply deals with manufacturers.

In another development, the EU on Tuesday set out plans for a rare-earth alliance with US to bolster its own resilience.

Meanwhile, US Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.dw.com/en/jd-vance/t-70177094) gave a keynote speech to delegates from key mineral‑producing countries on Wednesday, seeking to secure a rare-earth trading bloc to challenge China.

Rare earths and other critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and copper are essential for [electric vehicles](https://www.dw.com/en/electric-vehicles/t-18951760), [robotics](https://www.dw.com/en/robots/t-37675402), [artificial intelligence](https://www.dw.com/en/artificial-intelligence/t-42133476), [defense](https://www.dw.com/en/defense-and-military-spending/t-72055302) and [renewable energy](https://www.dw.com/en/renewable-energy/t-19008095).

# What is Project Vault?

Project Vault is the Trump administration's initiative to stockpile more than 50 critical minerals, including rare earths. 

""For years, ‍American businesses have risked running out of critical minerals during market disruptions,"" Trump said during the project's launch at the White House on Monday.

""Today, we're launching what will be known as Project Vault to ensure that American businesses and workers are ⁠never harmed by any shortage.""

Trump added: ""You're covering everything with this ... We're not just doing certain minerals and rare earths. We're doing everything.""

The US Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve will be backed by a $10 billion (€8.48 billion) loan from the US Export-Import Bank (EXIM), with up to an additional $2 billion in private capital. 

EXIM Bank president and chairman John Jovanovic [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/trump-stockpile-critical-minerals-reserve-project-vault.html) that the project creates a public-private partnership formula that ""is uniquely suited and puts America's best foot forward.""

More than a dozen companies have signed up to participate, including General Motors, Stellantis, Boeing, GE Vernova and Google. Bloomberg News reported that three commodities trading houses have signed deals to handle raw material purchases.

Officials say the initiative is also meant to support US manufacturing by keeping supply-chain risks off companies' balance sheets and ensuring a 60-day mineral reserve for emergencies.

At current prices, the $12 billion budget would be enough to buy every gram of critical minerals utilized outside of China in a year.

# Why did Trump launch Project Vault?

Project Vault is designed to counter China's longstanding use of [rare-earth minerals as geopolitical leverage](https://www.dw.com/en/can-the-west-break-chinas-grip-on-rare-earths/a-74474562), particularly during last year's [tariff war with Washington](https://www.dw.com/en/trump-tariffs/t-71496505).

China currently produces about two-thirds of the world's rare earths and refines nearly 90% of them, giving it a stranglehold on global supply.

Beijing twice moved to put controls on rare-earth exports during US-China trade negotiations, only to relax the curbs as tensions eased. This served as a reminder of how quickly China can weaponize its dominance in the sector.

These curbs caused immediate supply shortages and production delays among US and European manufacturers, accelerating calls for diversification of the critical minerals. 

Chinese leaders have wielded rare earths as leverage before. In 2010, Beijing abruptly cut exports to [Japan](https://www.dw.com/en/japan/t-19035046) during a diplomatic dispute, jolting supply chains and prices.

The planned US mineral stockpile is modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in response to the 1970s oil crisis, when an Arab oil embargo caused oil prices to quadruple, leading to widespread fuel shortages.

The new rare-earth reserves will help protect US manufacturers from supply shocks while supporting domestic production.

Project Vault reflects a broader effort by the Trump administration to harden US supply chains against geopolitical pressure. Over the past year, the Pentagon has spent nearly $5 billion to secure its access to the minerals.

Last month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and other critical minerals.

# What role is the EU playing in the fight for rare earths?

The EU faces many of the [same vulnerabilities](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-trying-to-end-china-rare-earth-dependence-von-der-leyen/a-74496790)as the US. Europe has almost no domestic rare-earth refining capacity and [relies overwhelmingly](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-frees-billions-in-bid-to-reduce-china-rare-earth-reliance/a-75004708) on Chinese processors for the permanent magnets used in wind turbines, electric vehicles and jet fighters.

The EU's Critical Raw Materials Act sets non-binding targets for domestic extraction, processing and recycling, while new funding aims to accelerate minerals projects in [Sweden](https://www.dw.com/en/sweden/t-66053585), [Finland](https://www.dw.com/en/finland/t-65197962), and [Greenland](https://www.dw.com/en/greenland/t-71244495), which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

These regions have some of the bloc's most promising rare-earth deposits — with Greenland offering particularly significant potential despite its non-EU status, which Trump cited recently when he floated a fresh bid to bring the island under US control.

Several European firms, including [Germany's](https://www.dw.com/en/germany/t-17871182) Vacuumschmelze, are expanding permanent-magnet production to give the continent its first scalable alternative to Chinese supply.

After Brussels this week proposed a rare-earth alliance across the Atlantic, the US Trade Representative's office confirmed Wednesday that it would partner with the EU and Japan to ""mitigate critical supply chain vulnerabilities.""

A joint press statement said the partners are ""taking significant steps towards increasing their economic security and national security"" by boosting resilience in the critical minerals sector.

# How is the US working with rare-earth suppliers?

Representatives of 55 countries, including EU states and Japan, gathered at the State Department in Washington, DC, on Wednesday for a summit on critical minerals.

Vance told them that the US wants to help build a ""trading bloc"" of rare earths among allies and partners that guarantees US access while ""also expanding production across the entire zone.""

The nations gathered also included major or emerging suppliers like [Australia](https://www.dw.com/en/australia/t-18172340), [India](https://www.dw.com/en/india/t-18996071) and [Thailand](https://www.dw.com/en/thailand/t-63342744), along with rare-earth consumers and processors, [South Korea](https://www.dw.com/en/south-korea/t-63357867), Germany and [Canada](https://www.dw.com/en/canada/t-39628562).

Several African nations, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, were also present. They are seen as critical partners in the supply of other critical minerals.

The proposed trading bloc would regulate minimum prices for critical minerals to prevent China from suddenly ramping up exports and undercutting other countries.

""We want to eliminate that problem of people flooding into our markets with cheap critical minerals to undercut our domestic manufacturers,"" Vance said.

""Investment is nearly impossible, and it will stay that way, so long as prices are erratic and unpredictable,"" he added.

Project Vault, the US-EU-Japan alliance and the planned critical minerals trading bloc are widely seen as helping to boost short-term protection and longer-term diversification from China.

But many analysts believe it will take five to 10 years of sustained investment to mount a credible challenge to the world’s leading producer and could create a glut of critical minerals if countries follow the US' example and create their own stockpiles.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

https://reddit.com/link/1qwih5k/video/gl4x8w6znnhg1/player

# KEY TAKEAWAYS IMHO: Feb 4th Wasn’t “A Meeting” — It Was the U.S. Declaring a New Critical Minerals World Order

This Fact Sheet above basically confirms the U.S. is no longer treating critical minerals like a normal commodity market — it’s being reclassified as a **national security + industrial policy battlefield**, and the U.S. is now building a **full diplomatic + financing + trade enforcement machine** to break China’s leverage. Between the Ministerial (54 countries), FORGE replacing the MSP, Pax Silica, price stabilization frameworks, and a pipeline of **$30B+** already in motion, the message is loud: **projects that can actually deliver will be fast-tracked, financed, and protected.** This is no longer “we should do something someday” — it’s “we’re doing it now, globally, with allies, with money.”

# WHY THIS MATTERS FOR NIOCORP: ELK CREEK IS LITERALLY WHAT THIS WHOLE PROGRAM IS BUILT FOR

This is where NioCorp stops being “a mining story” and becomes a **strategic supply chain weapon.** Project Vault is the storage-and-stability anchor. EXIM is the money cannon. FORGE is the diplomatic muscle. USTR is the trade enforcement. DOE is the buildout engine. And the whole thing is screaming for one type of asset: **a domestic, scalable, multi-mineral, vertically integrated operation** that can go from **ore → oxides → metals → alloys → magnet-grade materials → components.**

That is **exactly** Elk Creek. Not one mineral. Not a “maybe someday” junior. Not a single-point refinery dream. **Seven critical minerals in one U.S. orebody** with an experienced management team and a defined plan.

# Perhaps NioCorp is NOT in D.C. right now just for EXIM meetings?

They’re in D.C. because **the entire U.S. critical minerals architecture just turned on**, and NioCorp is positioning itself to be **inside the pipeline**, not watching from the outside.

This week is starting to look less like “news” and more like **the opening phase of the Elk Creek endgame.**

**What I find most interesting is:**

**Traxys isn’t some random “middleman” name tossed into Project Vault for optics.** It’s the *same Traxys* that signed a **binding scandium offtake agreement with NioCorp years ago** — back when almost nobody was willing to put real contractual teeth behind scandium supply. That means Traxys didn’t just “arrive” in 2026… they were early, they vetted Elk Creek early, and they moved first to lock in future supply before the rest of the market even understood what scandium was worth.

Now fast-forward to this week in Washington: **Project Vault goes live, EXIM becomes the money cannon, the U.S. rolls out global critical minerals diplomacy, and Traxys is positioned as a key enabling player inside the new strategic reserve framework.** And right in the middle of it sits NioCorp — one of the only U.S. projects that can deliver **Seven Critical Minerals** with a DFARS-aligned, end-to-end pathway. That’s why Mark Smith keeps hammering home: ""**2026 is the year!""** Not a slogan — it's a sequencing statement.

**This is exactly why Smith keeps calling Elk Creek a “National Strategic Asset” — because in the new Project Vault era, NioCorp isn’t pitching a mine anymore… it’s offering the U.S. a domestic supply chain.**

[This is exactly why Smith keeps calling Elk Creek a “National Strategic Asset” — because in the new Project Vault era, NioCorp isn’t pitching a mine anymore… it’s offering the U.S. a domestic supply chain!](https://reddit.com/link/1qwih5k/video/mrgtdgvlqnhg1/player)

While **EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes** are in deep discussions right now —They need a **fully domestic, DFARS-aligned, vertically integrated producer** that can scale into real contracts, real stockpiles, and real manufacturing security — and **NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.**

This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty — **not one metal at a time**, but through a single project that can bring **SEVEN critical minerals** into multiple defense and industrial supply chains **at once**… **from ore → oxides → metals → alloys → magnet-grade materials → components.**

And imho the Traxys detail matters: **the same Traxys now positioned inside Project Vault is the one that locked in NioCorp’s scandium early with a binding agreement years ago.** That’s not coincidence — that’s continuity. It’s proof that the players who understand the bottleneck have been circling Elk Creek long before the market caught up.

When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It’ll be exactly what Mark Smith has been calling it — a ""**U.S. National Strategic Asset""**… and in the Project Vault era, NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — **it’s the platform the solution gets built on.**

My girlfriend [28F] left me [28M] after six and a half years of being together. From my point of view, things were going well, but from hers, it didn’t look the same. Looking back on the relationship, it was cold. I wasn’t as invested as she was, and often she put more effort into the relationship. I was physically present but passive. I was always dissatisfied with what I had or didn’t have, among other things.

At the end of the relationship, she reproached me for everything that bothered her about me, about our relationship, and for the fact that after so many years I hadn’t proposed. The things she said were true. No woman would stay with an uninvolved man who doesn’t give meaning to the relationship, but instead stays passive, doing things out of inertia.

In the end, she told me that for many months she felt like I was living a double life, spending too much time on my phone, hiding the screen, neglecting her sexually, not paying attention to her, not appreciating her, which made her unhappy in the relationship. I begged her, saying that everything she mentioned could be corrected and that we could still have a good life together. At that moment, she said she was emotionally empty and no longer saw a future for us because we had started behaving like a couple married for 30 years—even though we weren’t.

I should mention that overall, our relationship was beautiful. We started when we were 22. It was the first long-term relationship for both of us. There were no fights, accusations of cheating, nights away from home, or suspicions of infidelity. She decided to leave me, and we cut all contact for a month and a half. However, later she came back wanting to reconcile. During that time, she admitted that she had met with a coworker, but nothing more than a kiss happened, at which point she stopped, realizing things weren’t going in the right direction as he was in a long term relationship.

After two months of being apart, we both lost 10 kg. I tried to meet other girls. I went out with a girl for coffee, but it stopped there because my depressive state was at its peak, and I couldn’t see myself with anyone else

Loving her very much and accepting all my mistakes, plus considering ourhistory, I agreed to reconcile. It’s been three months since then. Now, we get along very well. There are no signs that she’s hiding anything or living a double life. She is very committed to the relationship, talks about “us” in the future tense, and makes sure the relationship works so that we don’t end up in the same situation again.

I had a broken marriage before her, another chunk of my life wasted on someone who didn't care about me the same way. I want it to just go away, I wish I could erase my memories. I wish my time didn't feel wasted, ending a relationship traumatically messes with those good memories you keep.  

&nbsp;

I haven't talked to her since August. I made the mistake of reaching out again over the summer and she made me feel comfortable doing it, but she was still with him and it drove me half mad. She made me think we could have a future and try again, then she chose him over me all over again and it just devastated me. It was so good to be close to her again, hear her voice, smell her smells, look forward to her texts. I'm so stupid. I've tried dating, I hated it. Everyone just uses me. I tried drinking but I was developing some alcoholism fairly quickly and hiding inside a bottle. God, I've smoked so much weed and cried so much over the last year I can't fathom it. I just want to have a normal dream that doesn't include some nightmare element about her, she haunts me.

&nbsp;

I swore off talking to her it was so painful, she just wanted my attention in a selfish way. I don't look pictures and I try hard not to wallow in the past. I focus on hobbies and expend energy. I've lost almost 100 pounds. I'm in better shape and I'm so much more healthy but I still feel like mental mud. Therapy didn't help, it was too infrequent and they just wanted to toss pills at me. I don't have family, my mother passed away a few years ago now and it's hard being alone. My friends are all older with lives, it's so hard making new friends when you're 40. Isolation and dark thoughts are getting to me, I need to change my life. Reaching out to people keeps hurting more then helping though. I'm just posting to get it out of me this morning, screaming into the darkness again. Time to beat my ass with some exercise and watch the sun come up. At least exercise feels good. And I thank the universe for coffee, coffee will never break my heart. I just want to feel better. Thanks for reading.",1,1770289163.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

We live together. She doesnt have a car right now because hers died a few months ago and she hasnt been able to afford a replacement yet. So every morning I drive her to work before heading to my own job. Her shift starts at 9 and mine starts at 10 so it works out timing wise even though her job is kind of out of the way for me.

I dont mind doing it. Or I didnt mind. Because heres the thing. Every single morning she is the worst version of herself in that car. She stays up until like 2 or 3am on her phone watching tiktoks or whatever and then has to be up by 8 and shes miserable about it. Ive told her to go to sleep earlier and she says she needs her downtime. She gets off work at 4. She has plenty of downtime. But whatever.

The drives are brutal though. She complains about everything. My music is annoying. Im driving too fast or too slow. I didnt get her coffee. The car smells weird even though I literally cleaned it. And shes just mean about it. Not playful mean. Actually mean. Snapping at me, rolling her eyes, making comments under her breath. And when I bring it up later she says she was just tired and out of it and I need to stop being so sensitive.

Last thursday was the last straw. Im driving her to work and she looks over at me and goes ""can you at least brush your teeth before you trap me in a car with you"" in this genuinely disgusted voice. I had already brushed my teeth. I always do. I have good hygiene. She just wanted to be cruel because shes tired and Im the closest target.

That night I told her Im done. I said I will not be driving her to work anymore. Im done being her punching bag every morning for doing her a favor. She can figure out her own transportation. She got upset and said I was overreacting and that she didnt mean it but I said no this is done.

Friday she took an uber. Monday she said she couldnt afford another uber and asked me to drive her just this once. I said no. She ended up being almost two hours late because she was trying to figure out the bus route. Apparently she was already on thin ice at her job because shed been late before and this was the final straw. They let her go.

She called me screaming. Saying I got her fired. That I knew she had no other way to get there and I did this on purpose. When I got home she was still going off and then said I need to pay for her half of rent and expenses until she finds a new job since its my fault she lost this one.

I dont know. Maybe going cold turkey was too much but I hit my limit

- One Day More, Les Miserables

-------------------------

##**Shiraz - August 21st, 2026**

Karim sat outside, enjoying a cigarette and stroking his beard. Not in a secretly-villainous way, but in that he hadn’t let his facial hair grow out this long for quite a few years and he was incredibly unfamiliar with the feeling. It’s been only around three weeks since he and Nasim had begun planning the Shiraz uprising, and he could feel it weighing on him physically. Possibly not aided by the fact his smoking has had a noticeable uptick to approximately a pack a day. Nasim chastised him that more money was going to his smoking than to small arms ammunition.

He took a glance up to the sky. Clouds had gathered overhead, the overcast weather left him moody, as if the air itself brought a sense of pessimism. But he was certain he was simply overthinking it, there’s been far too much weighing on his mind. The plan for the Shiraz Uprising simply came together too quickly, he hadn’t even had time to consciously acknowledge the last four months of his life. He wouldn’t get that time for a retrospective today, either. He could see Sam approaching on his bicycle. He took a final drag of his cigarette and threw the stub to the ground.

“Karim, comrade!” Sam was always far too eager. Karim initially chalked it up to youthful energy, but there was something else going on with Sam that made him just so unapologetically upbeat. Nasim’s waiting for you, just go down this block, to the right, and she’s down that street with some of the others. You'll see the flags right when you turn the corner, don't worry!” Sam had been circling Karim on his bike the entire time he said this. As he began pedalling back to Nasim he quickly turned back for one last loop around Karim as he said, “Oh! Forgot to mention, Nasim’s moved your car to a garage up by the Arg with the *perfect* path to speed out of the city and save all your other comrades okay see you later!”

*There is something* absolutely *wrong with that kid,* Karim thought as he lit up another cigarette and began walking down the street, patting the Makarov in its holster along his hip. He might finally get an opportunity to use this old heirloom.

The many flags of Iran flew in the breeze in the Koze Gari Square. It was his idea to throw in basically every flag they could find or easily make, the Shah, the first flag of the Islamic Republic, the current flag, even a couple replicas of the very very brief soviet republic flag, and a hammer and sickle as a nice touch. His idea was to show a true united front to attract as many people as possible, and it certainly seemed to be working. A large crowd had gathered but he quickly spotted Nasim through the thick of it all. She stood with a black armband around her left bicep, the same as all the other resistance members.

“Nasim, I’m here,” Karim shouted out as he shoved his way through.

She spotted him instantly, running up to drag him to the circle that had formed around the group. Another rebel fastened an armband around his left bicep, matching all the others, and handed him an AK. Then another looked up after checking his AK. “Today’s the day, comrades.”

“Indeed it is,” Nasim responded. “Comrades, today we’re gathered here to make a change. A change not just for Shiraz, but for all of Iran. Remember, our job here is going to be to pull as many IRGC bastards as possible to focus here, giving Karim here, and all his allies back in Tehran, an opportunity to pull off something great. All those who fight here today will be honoured, those who fall here will be remembered as martyrs. This is the first true fight the IRGC will be seeing, so we’ll be making fucking sure that they see what Iran has to offer.”

Karim looked around and could see all the rebels were attentive to her speech. He couldn’t help but feel sorrow knowing the faces he sees here, young and old, would likely die all just for his plan to work. But on the other hand, they trusted him. He had an obligation here that he must fulfill, nothing else in life matters now.

“We’re all familiar with the plan but remember, there are caches of weapons throughout the city, if you’re running low on ammo then find one and stock up. Anybody you see on the street who’s trying to fight or seems willing but is unarmed? Take them to one, arm them. Traps are laid out throughout the entire southern half of the city. And remember, for the love of god, do not cross the Khoshk river. We’re focusing on keeping their focus north of the airport, south of North Iman street, west of the Khosk river. Our allies' efforts in the north and in the airport to the south are just to disrupt and harass.” She gave a moment's pause to make sure everyone had understood the boundaries. “One day more comrades, then a new Iran will be born! For the revolution!”

“And for Iran!” They all shouted back.

The protest in the square had swelled magnificently by the end of the speech. Karim could see protestors along the three roads that all intersect at the square where they stood now. For a brief moment, it reminded him of Tehran that night in May, it felt like a lifetime ago now. But there was a significant difference harem he knew throughout all the protestors, countless armed rebels stood with them, waiting for the signal. The sounds of trucks could be heard through the chants of the crowd. Nasim on her small wooden box gave him a knowing nod. The IRGC had arrived.

From the south two trucks worth of IRGC soldiers filed out to block the protest from expanding any further towards the airport, equipped with riot shields they had immediately thrown tear gas into the crowd. Nasim gave Karim a gas mask, after both of them had put their masks on she grabbed his arm and led him down the street that led north from the Koze Gari Square.

A helicopter flew overhead, southbound, likely to the airport Karim figured. It became worrying when two more were following it quickly. “They’re coming faster than we expected!” He shouted out of his mask. Nasim couldn’t hear him, or if she did, she didn’t show any sign of it.

Close to a half hour of running north through the crowd of protestors they finally reached a significantly less dense area and could catch their breath. Karim took off his mask and looked at Nasim, “They’re coming faster than we expected.”

Nasim pulled her mask up to her head. “I know. It’s alright though, we just need to get to Qavem House. It’s just a block down from the overpass.” Qavem House was one of the many landmarks in Shiraz chosen by the rebels to work as an operating base during the uprising. It’s also, not coincidentally, the most armed base. Karim glanced at his watch, fifteen minutes until the signal. He doubted they would get there in time. He gave Nasim a nod and they both threw their gas masks back on and continued.

Crossing the overpass went off without a hitch. Walking down a single block, however, proved to be a problem. There was an IRGC roadblock set up just after the overpass, set up to block any escape to the highway as well as to preemptively prevent the protester crowd from expanding too much in that direction. Though the roadblock was poorly manned, five soldiers could be seen from the bushes that Karim and Nasim found themselves in.

Nasim fumbled for a grenade, though Karim knew it would be an impossible throw from here. “What’s your plan?” Karim asked.

“Throw it down the side road there to the right, when they go to investigate, we shoot them. Simple.”

Karim wasn’t surprised at the bluntness and cockiness that came with the very-easily-could-go-wrong plan, but he’s come to accept that as part of this city’s charm. He gave her a nod, she pulled the pin and chucked it as hard as she could down the side. The explosion came seconds later and four of the soldiers rushed to investigate, leaving one to man the post.

They both moved their gas masks above their heads to get clean shots, Karim put his sights over the lone soldier at the post and waited for Nasim’s signal. She fired her shots, he fired his. As he saw his target drop dead he turned and saw Nasim got hers. Before he could move his rifle back down she had already grabbed his arm and was sprinting down the road, dragging him alongside her. He didn’t realize why until he noticed their shadows didn’t quite make sense, that being, they had two. He glanced behind him and saw a red flare sparkling above the city, roughly where Koze Gari Square was by his estimate. Then he saw another shoot up into the sky further north, and another further east, soon a dozen sparkling red suns drifted over Shiraz. The signal had been given, and they were late.

*BOOM … BOOM … BOOOM BOOMBOOM*

Mortar shells began raining from the sky, hitting the airport in the south of the city. And if they didn’t get to Qavam House soon, those mortars would be adjusting their sights to make sure the IRGC aren’t able to secure it. They turned left down the block and it was in their sights now. The first mortar strike had just finished, and a visual flare tally and radio check to each base would be coming soon.

“Nasim, *GO!*” Karim shouted as he shrugged her hand off of him. She was far faster than he was and they both knew it. She didn’t argue as she ran forwards, the gap between them widening quickly. She turned into the house while he was half a block behind and he saw her practically break the door down and, half a moment later, come running back out with a gun in hand firing it above her head.

He collapsed the moment he entered the house. He had never felt his age quite so much until being forced to run like an olympian with an assault rifle slung over his back and a gas mask tugging at his hair. He could hear the second mortar strikes coming in now from outside, farther away this time. “Any base not checked in?” He asked after catching his breath.

“Two. Jamaran Park and Afif Abad Garden,” a rebel inside Qavam told him. “Everyone else has checked in.” She turned to look at Nasim before continuing. “Ma’am, the metro stations are all primed as well.”

“Good, we’ll give the order in an hour, after sunset, unless the IRGC uses it. Just keep me informed.” Karim responded.

As the second round of mortar strikes ended, the chattering of gunfire began outside, far in the distance. Karim knew they only had enough mortar rounds to do six significant strikes. He hoped he wouldn’t hear any of them for the rest of the night. Nasim and him went up to the rooftop alongside some other members of the rebels based here. The rooftop access was right beside the radio operator, who was rapidly relaying what the other bases were saying to a nearby rebel officer. Karim could only think about how many of their soldiers and civilians had already died, and this would only be the start.

Those thoughts quickly dissipated as he lay on the rooftop, sharing binoculars with Nasim as they watched the city erupt. Six other rebel soldiers were up here, three sniper teams all with dedicated nests on different sides of the building. Karim had a clear view of Koze Gari Square and watched as he could see the protesters scramble, many likely returning to wherever their homes may be, with others being led by rebels to arm caches throughout the city. Down the road where the IRGC troops first deployed, now lay 12 uniformed bodies and two trucks on fire. Further north, he could see the efforts of the rebels harassing any troops attempting to enter the city to surround the protesters, RPGs were fired down at presumably convoys, muzzle flashes erupted from apartment buildings picking off random soldiers. Ideally, these efforts would convince the IRGC to avoid pushing through the north.

He passed the binoculars back to Nasim as she smiled over the progress. “They may have reacted faster than we expected, but they’re putting up a far weaker fight.” She turned to him. “Do you think we can do enough to pull the troops from Tehran?”

Karim didn’t hesitate. “They will do anything to quell this.” He said it with such authority that even he believed this was truly an inevitability. Then he saw in the distance more helicopters, he pointed them out to Nasim and she looked as they came in from the north. She counted two Chinooks and a single SuperCobra. Even without the binoculars, Karim could see the pursuing smoke lines. Three smoke trails flew towards one of the Chinooks flying behind the SuperCobra, one of them hit and it immediately began flying out of control, smashing into the side of an apartment building. The SuperCobra turned back and fired into the side of one of the apartment buildings, before moving on to the rooftop that another RPG team had been and doing the same. At least a dozen rebel soldiers died in the blink of an eye. They continued moving south towards the airport, until another line of smoke came. This one was far less shaky, more controlled, then the last three that took out the Chinook. One of the very very few Misagh-3 MANPADs the rebels had gotten hold of. It hit the SuperCobra’s tail and it began tail spinning before crashing into the street below. The final helicopter left, the Chinook, however, had managed to get past the range of any further anti-air they had and seemed to have landed.

“Now.. Now I’m certain they’ll respond.”

Karim left the roof and headed downstairs, for a much desired and deserved nap.

##**August 22cd**

He had slept far, far longer than he intended to. He rolled out of his cot and glanced at his watch, the short hand resting just past the 3. The sun leaking into the house proved that was not the 3am he had hoped to wake up at to assist in organizing the uprising.

He found Nasim hovering over the radio operator down the hall from the makeshift bedroom, staring at a map of the city that was pinned up, much like the first time they had met. “Good morning,” Nasim muttered as she offered a cup of coffee. “It’s a bit cold, I made it an hour ago when we tried to wake you up.”

“Thanks,” Karim sipped from it. Its cold bitter taste knocked him awake better than the caffeine itself ever could. “How is it going today?” He asked as he stared at the map, trying to translate what its many dots and slash marks and crossed out areas meant.

“Skirmishes are continuing across the city, IRGC troops have continued to ferry in regularly. A second Chinook was shot down. We don’t think we’re remotely near a full response though. We blew the metro line just after you had gone to bed. We have reports that our trap network is successful at eliminating a majority of soldiers that got past our northern harassment forces. I think that’s everything really?” She glanced at the radio operator, who gave her a shrug. “Oh, our losses are relatively minimal, a lot of the IRGC troops were already quite unfamiliar with the city, having been brought in after the Americans attacked the south, maybe three dozen in total so far. We have no way to keep track of how many regime soldiers we’ve killed, but estimate? Easily in the hundreds now.”

Karim nodded along while still staring at the map, he finally noticed a triangle over what seemed like where the Chinook from last night had landed, and another of the same symbol further south. “Those triangles, did we recover anything from the Chinooks?”

“Some small arms from the first, nothing from the second. Regrettably, the second was empty of soldiers. The body count in the first was around 40, we think.” He didn’t want to think what that ‘we think’ exactly meant in this context. He was proud of the work that was being done, they just had to wait it out now till a full response.

##**August 25th**

The 23rd and 24th were, relatively speaking considering the circumstances, quite uneventful. Another round of mortars hit a small convoy that attempted to enter, a third and fourth Chinook had both been downed, one of them with the second and last Misagh-3 they had secured. But besides all that, it really was just business as usual, coordinate strikes against IRGC patrols, run to a cache to resupply the local base, help the sniper teams at night, set up some new traps. Rinse and repeat. That was, at least, until midday on the 25th, while Karim and Rasim were doing another shift of idly watching the city on the rooftop. Then they saw, in broad daylight, the approach of the true strength of the IRGC. At least ten Chinooks and half a dozen SuperCobra’s could be seen flying in from the north, the radio operator down the ladder beside them was yelling about how the harassment squads were reporting a convoy of over fifty vehicles, including trucks, APCs, and eight tanks.

“Fucking hell,” Karim muttered. Rasim was already sliding down the ladder to the radio operator.

“Kamran tell the mortar teams to target the highway section in front of them immediately, Farah organize a team of four we need to get Karim to the Arg of Karim Khan, Baraz tell the harassment forces to open fire on their own call,” she ran down to the bedrooms and grabbed a handheld radio, tossing it to Karim. “Hold onto this for me.” Karim followed her down the stairs as Farah’s team got prepared.

The first round of mortars began falling, he could hear through the radio as they realized they shot too far north, missing a bulk of the convoy.

Rasim stared him down. For the first time since he first met her, he felt a sense of fear from the woman. “We have one shot at this. The car is parked right at the corner of a street that runs straight down from the back of the Arg. Listen carefully. You’re going to drive down Hejrat Boulevard. It’s a straight shot onto the highway. The moment you go across the Khosk River, we’re blowing all the bridges. Get to Tehran.” He looked back at her, meeting her eyes. “I will, I promise.”

“We’ve heard from Ebrahim as well, they moved out of the city late last night. Same with the leaders of Arak and Saveh with their people. Estimates are in the tens of thousands, possibly even more. There’s rumours that parliament is moving towards dissolving the Islamic Republic. You need to make them.”

Karim lost his focus, only briefly, then he felt an overwhelming sense of pride and hope. Their goal was achievable, and his reinforcements to Tehran were on the move. It was coming together. The second round of mortars began falling outside, reports that some of the convoy was hit, but the Chinooks are landing troops unopposed throughout the city.

“FARAH!” Rasim shouted. “We are leaving, ***now.***”

Farah and three of her comrades came running down the staircase fully equipped to deal with whatever came their way. One with an HMG, another an RPG and SMG, and all of them covered with an assortment of grenades. “Ready ma’am,” Farah said with a quick salute.

The six of them exited Qavam House, and quickly witnessed the warzone erupting outside. Smoke trails from RPGs missing their marks littered the sky above, the gunfire was deafening and coming from all sides, in the distance Karim witnessed tank rounds pounding into an apartment building that had hosted a significant number of rebel forces. Karim hadn’t even noticed his radio had been cackling the entire time, countless voices overlapping with each other, the panic rising in their voices with every new statement. He could hear the explosion of mortars hitting the city core followed by someone on the radio screaming “*DANGER CLOSE YOU FUCKS*” followed by “*NOT US NOT US I REPEAT ITS NOT OUR MORTARS.*” He turned and quickly followed the other five down the street.

They were sneaking in and out of random buildings whenever a vehicle could be heard approaching. Hiding in alleyways as helicopters flew overhead, letting out their signature *brrrRRRRRrRRrRrrRR* as they found some poor rebel soldier on the street. Shooting out windows and jumping from windows or balconies to avoid being seen by IRGC soldiers going door to door. It took close to an hour to reach the end of the block.

A loud voice cackled over the ever-present radio, “COBRA DOWN COBRA DOWN I REPEAT, A SECOND COBRA IS DOWN.” He saw Farah and Nasim smile when he repeated the news to them, he was starting to realize that they knew they were dooming themselves just for this shot at Tehran. That *everyone* here knew this was a suicidal attempt.

“TANKS HAVE BREACHED THE NORTHERN BARRICADES I REPEAT TANKS ARE I-*BOOM* … *BOOM* HA, hahahaha*BOOM*ahahaha. The- fuck, baha*BOOM* four of the tanks hit our mi-*BOOM* correction, five of the tanks have hit our mines. Repeating, five tanks are out of commission.” This one made all six of them also break into laughter. If these soldiers are what the IRGC could muster for putting down an uprising, Tehran would fall in hours.

They could see it now. The Arg of Karim Khan. In between them and it though, sat an IRGC APC and at least two dozen IRGC soldiers patrolling. Karim and Rasim and the others quickly crossed unseen into a building that could overlook it. The patrol had seemingly taken up position right at the intersection and were refusing to move. Rasim grabbed the radio off of Karim.

“All units, if anyone is near the Arg, report immediately.” Three voices cackled in with a *yes.* Two were near their own position just further south, and another sat to the northeast, who were the squad explicitly in charge of making sure the road to the highway stayed clear for Karim’s escape. Farah and her began muttering to themselves about hypothetical plans, Karim lit up a cigarette, and wondered if this is how things may end. So close to the end.

Rasim muttered something into the radio, and Karim saw a smile inch across her face. Soon five of them were leaving the building they were in and going forward, leaving behind the man armed with the RPG alone to watch them. After they holed up in the building next to the last one, Karim heard the sound of soldiers yelling. A squad of soldiers were coming up the same way they came. “Hold fire, they’re friendly.” Rasim told the rest of them.

The squad moved past their building, and then the distinct explosion and following trail of smoke flew past them as their own squadmate fired his RPG at the IRGC APC. It was a direct hit, but the turret was still operable as it began returning fire. The yelling of IRGC troops and friendly rebel soldiers began as small arms fire went off. Then another RPG came flying by, missing the APC but hitting right beside it taking out at least one or two IRGC soldiers. Karim dared a peak out the windows and saw IRGC soldiers now facing down the road he had to go down, the second squad of rebel soldiers advancing and putting pressure on their flank. As he watched, he saw two of the rebels fall.

“NOW.” Rasim once again grabbed Karim’s arm and ran out across the street towards the Arg of Karim Khan. More rebel soldiers appeared behind the IRGC troops, another RPG hitting the APC, causing it to explode. They began gunning down the last few of them that were still putting up a resistance. Some of the remaining soldiers threw their arms down offering surrender, the offer was clearly refused as Karim watched their bodies collapse to the ground.

The celebrations of the rebel squads was brief though, as more IRGC soldiers came up behind them, the three rebel squads were defending Rasim’s squad and Karim as they turned the corner and finally reached where Karim’s car sat, sitting on the corner of a street, untouched from the uprising. Rasim shoved Karim into the driver seat. “Go! Get fucking going!” She shouted as she slammed the door, stray bullets hitting the side of the car as the rebels tried their best to cover them. She ran to join them. ""Thank you Rasim, for everything."" Karim shouted back to her, she turned to him and gave him a nod, before running back to her comrades.

Karim threw the keys into the ignition, putting the car into drive, and slammed the pedal, turning down the street. In the rearview mirror he could see the rebels slowly falling to the ground as an IRGC jeep came up behind them, gunning down the remaining rebel soldiers, he never saw Rasim fall, but he knew she had. As his car bumped off the bridge he saw the explosion of the bridge behind him, he hit the highway only a minute later.

With Shiraz ablaze behind him, and Tehran far ahead of him.

1qwi7ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1qwi7ib/i_think_a_girl_from_my_university_likes_me_but/,"I think a girl from my university likes me, but now she’s acting distant and I’m confused","Hi everyone. This is my first Reddit post because I honestly don’t know where else I can talk about this.

I’m a second-year IT student. \[19M\]

The girl in this story, let’s call her Amanda \[19F\], is a third-year student. We live in a small university dorm where guys and girls live in neighboring rooms, so people naturally hang out together.

At the beginning of this academic year, we formed a small friend group: me and my roommates, and Amanda with her best friend.

At first, everything was casual. We saw each other sometimes, followed each other on TikTok, nothing special. During this semester, a lot changed for me. I took extra courses, started working, and also broke up with my ex because that relationship was toxic and emotionally abusive.

After the semester ended, during winter break, I realized I wasn’t even following Amanda on Instagram, so I followed her and we started talking.

We chatted pretty often. She added me to her “Close Friends” on Instagram, I knew what she was doing day to day, and we were texting almost every day. When the new semester was about to start, we tried to meet, but it didn’t really work out. Still, I slowly realized I was starting to like her.

Then I had to go abroad for almost two weeks and miss the beginning of classes. Before I left, I promised Amanda I would call her. I did, and we talked for about half an hour.

A few days later, we talked again for a long time. It felt easy and close. I was pretty sure I liked her.

When I came back, there was a big university dance party. I suggested that Amanda and our friend group go together, and we did. When I first saw her that night, I was honestly shocked by how beautiful she looked. I gave her a lot of compliments and hugged her when we met.

We went together, I helped her walk because it was icy outside, opened doors for her, all that.

At the party, we took photos and stood really close, holding each other by the waist. I invited her to dance many times. We held hands, touched each other’s palms, hugged, and it felt natural. At one point, I even kissed her hand, and she smiled and blushed.

Later she got tired and sat down, and I asked if I could hug her. She said yes immediately. She leaned into me, we sat close, my arm around her, my hand on her leg. We honestly looked like a couple. I really wanted to kiss her but was scared to cross a line.

Near the end of the night, I finally kissed her. She was surprised, but not in a negative way. After that, we walked back holding hands. I helped her get into the car. When we got back, I gave her souvenirs I had brought from abroad. She looked really happy.

When we said goodbye, she kissed me.

That same night, one of my close friends got really sick emotionally, so I stayed with him, helped him, and made sure he was okay. Amanda and her friend were there too, and they told me I was kind and caring for not just leaving him. I think this matters because that moment interrupted everything that was happening between me and Amanda, and we didn’t really get a proper emotional ending to the night.

Later that night, I texted her thanking her for such a beautiful evening and told her it was special because of her. I also asked her out for coffee the next day.

She said she would be free after 4 PM, but in the end we didn’t go. We met later with friends, but nothing about that night was mentioned. We just talked normally, laughed, and made TikToks. She leaned into me a bit, but nothing clearly romantic.

When we said goodbye, she lightly touched my fingers and left. I don’t know if that was flirting or just being friendly.

What makes this harder is that I saw an anonymous post on our university’s confession page that said something like:

***“I’m friends with someone who likes me, but I don’t want a relationship with them, and they haven’t confessed yet.”***

I don’t know if that was about me, but the timing scared me.

Now we still chat on TikTok, send each other funny videos, and everything feels warm and positive. I also saw her repost something joking about being afraid of guys who want to get into a relationship with her because she can “disappear to a random country.”

I don’t know what to do next. I don’t want to pressure her or make her uncomfortable. At the same time, she reposts things about wanting someone confident who takes initiative.

So I’m stuck. She kissed me. We were very close. But now it feels unclear.

It was beat up, the spine was cracked, and it cost $4. I almost put it back because I wanted a hardcover, but something about the worn edges made me feel like it had been loved, so I bought it.

When I got home and cracked it open to page 142, a folded piece of yellow legal pad paper fell out.

It wasn’t a bookmark. It was a letter. Dated **October 14, 2004**.

The handwriting was frantic, scribbled in blue ink. It read:

*""David, I hid the bonds in the hollow leg of the old workbench in the garage. I don't trust Elena. If anything happens to me, check the leg. Do not sell the house until you check. Love, Dad.""*

I froze. This felt like I was intruding, but also like I was holding a grenade. I looked at the inside cover of the book. There was a name stamped in faint red ink: **Ex Libris: Arthur P. Halloway.**

I know the internet can be a weird place, but I felt a moral obligation to find ""David."" I hopped on Ancestry and local obituaries. It took me three hours of ""Internet Detective"" work (which I usually use to see if my ex is dating anyone new, let’s be honest), but I found an obituary for an Arthur Halloway who died in 2005 in Tacoma.

He had a surviving son: David.

I found David on Facebook. He looked to be in his 50s now. I sent him a message. It sat in the ""Request"" folder for two days. I assumed he’d think I was a scammer.

Yesterday, my phone pinged.

**David:** ""Who is this? How do you have my father’s handwriting?""

I explained the book. I sent him a picture of the note.

He called me immediately via Messenger audio. He was crying. He told me that his father died of a sudden heart attack in 2005. His stepmother, ""Elena,"" had liquidated everything immediately. David had always suspected his father had left something for him and his sister, but they never found a will or any assets. They ended up selling the house to Elena’s brother a month after the funeral.

But here is the kicker: **The workbench is still there.**

David drove to the house this morning (it’s currently being rented out). He explained the situation to the current tenants, showed them the photo of the note I found, and asked if he could look at the old workbench in the garage.

They let him in.

He just messaged me an hour ago with a photo. The leg of the workbench had a false bottom. Inside wasn't cash—it was a series of bearer bonds and a property deed to a cabin in Montana that Elena never knew about.

He told me, ""I’ve felt crazy for 20 years thinking my dad left us nothing. You just gave me my father back.""

I put the tag as simple questions because I feel like thats the broadest term 

What am I meant to expect? This is the first time Im working out and trying to get skinny so I have no clue what am I meant to expect from body changes, like, yeah sure, Ill get stronger and smaller, but is that it? No specifics? Just cut calories and keep exercising? 

Ive noticed my skin got tighter, it's not that saggy, thighs and back folds got smaller. 

I'm already a very light eater, my diet is whatever we are able to afford, so unfortunately I cant make something healthier, and I'm chronically ill, so we dont have a lot of money to spend. Working out would've been extremely painful, until a doctor told me to go to a pool. Which is amazing, I actually love aqua jogging, it's so much fun. 

I workout Mondays and Fridays, 2hours each, it's all I can do, it's not my pool, just doing aqua jogging. (My form is fine, it was the first thing I took reference of) my partner swims around so I have conversation while doing all that, so it's never boring. 

I have an app to track calories and I usually round up, for example 321cal to 400cal, just to be mindful of any changes. It tells me 1600 is the limit, but on average I eat around 800cal? I am also drinking my water! I never really enjoyed it much, preferring coffee, but since im not gonna take coffee to the pool, ive been very good and hydrated. 

However seems like I'm stuck at 94-92kg (207lbs-202lbs, which sounds awful, but id say I'm more chubby than fat?) I guess my other questions, besides what to expect, is that I have 2 theories, fat is being 'moved' or my skin gets tight before I start losing the weight? If those 2 things aren't the case then I just lost genetic lottery and got all the bad traits from my parents. 

I don't have a set goal in mind, it's kind of a get to a happy point situation. When I get there what do I do? I don't want to work out for the rest of my life, cause I can't afford the gym and I won't be able to use my neighbors pool forever. 

I am on a lot of pills so I do know that can hinder progress, i just didnt know how much.

For years, if you said you worked in Gurgaon, everyone assumed you meant Cyber City. And sure, Cyber City has the brand value, but it also has the gridlock, the endless queues for parking, and the noise.

If you are a business owner or a decision-maker looking for [**Office Space in Sector 62 Gurgaon**](https://www.trueassetsconsultancy.com/properties/office-space-in-sector-62-gurgaon), you are likely looking for something different. You want the premium address, but you also want to be able to hear yourself think.

Sector 62, sitting confidently on the Golf Course Extension Road, is quickly becoming the choice for companies that have graduated from the chaos of the old hubs and want a space that feels as professional as they are.

# The ""Extension"" Advantage

The biggest selling point here is the road itself. Unlike the clogged arteries of Udyog Vihar, the Golf Course Extension Road is wide, functional, and actually moves.

When you choose an office here, you aren't just getting a desk; you are getting accessibility.

* **For the Boss:** You can drive in from the luxe residential pockets of Golf Course Road in under 15 minutes.
* **For the Team:** The **Sector 55-56 Rapid Metro Station** is just a short auto-rickshaw ride away. It’s close enough to be convenient for commuters coming from Delhi, but far enough that you don't have metro crowds spilling onto your doorstep.

# Buildings That Mean Business

Let’s talk about the inventory. You won't find crumbling facades or converted residential plots here. Sector 62 is home to Grade-A giants like **Pioneer Urban Square**, **Imperia Mindspace**, and the striking **AIPL Business Club**.

These buildings are designed for the modern workforce. We are talking about:

* **Proper Parking:** Multi-level basements mean your employees don’t have to start their day fighting for a spot on the service lane.
* **The ""Campus"" Feel:** Many of these developments offer open courtyards and landscaped green zones. It’s a small detail, but being able to take a walk during lunch without dodging traffic makes a huge difference to mental health.

# Lunch Hour Sorted

One of the underrated struggles of office life is the question, ""Where do we eat?"" In Sector 62, you are sorted. You aren't limited to a sad office canteen. The area is packed with high-street retail complexes like **Urban Cubes** and nearby commercial hubs that offer everything from a quick Subway sandwich to a sit-down business lunch at a fine-dining spot.

It is a self-sustaining ecosystem. You can step out for a coffee, host a client dinner, or even run a quick errand at a nearby pharmacy, all within a 500-meter radius of your office.

# The Verdict: Value Meets Vibe

Renting or buying **Office Space in Sector 62 Gurgaon** is currently the sweet spot in the market. You are getting world-class infrastructure—often better than Cyber City—but at a price point that still makes financial sense.

If you want your office to say ""we have arrived"" without shouting it, Sector 62 is where you put down your roots.
