1pit6mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianInLaw/comments/1pit6mp/narc_mil_thinks_i_need_to_take_her_permission_to/,Narc mil thinks i need to take her “permission” to go out on a date with my husband,"
So I was making a list of things I want to do when we go to India, and one of the big ones was watching a movie in an actual theatre. We haven’t seen a movie in theatres since our son was born.

The moment I mentioned it, MIL jumped in saying *she* would go with me and my husband could stay home with the baby.

I told her, “Shouldn’t it be the other way around? It’s been ages since we’ve had a date.”

She immediately got defensive and asked why I “have to go with my husband alone.” Then she added, “Have I ever stopped you? A lot of MILs don’t even permit that, you know.”

I couldn’t help myself — I smirked and said, “I’m not asking for your permission. I’m informing you.”

For context: she stayed with us for 3 months and not even once did she tell either me or my husband to go get coffee together while she watched the baby. Not once.

Last year when we visited India, my husband and I were going through a rough patch. We made a conscious decision to spend at least 10 minutes a day alone, just going for short walks. MIL hated it. She even commented that I was “obsessed with her son.” Like… what?

We didn’t even get a single dinner together as a couple. And this year we finally had a small list of simple things to do as a couple, thinking that **family** would be able to watch our toddler for a couple of hours.

But now? I’m seriously rethinking whether I even want MIL watching my kid when both of us are out. She’ll absolutely hold it over our heads like she did us some huge favor.

These pipe shelf brackets turned my boring wall into “expensive” industrial shelves



I grabbed these **KAKAHOUS Industrial Pipe Shelf Brackets** on Amazon thinking they’d be cheap and wobbly, but they’re actually super solid.

What I like:

* **Heavy-duty iron** – holding books, jars, plants, no bending, no wobble
* **Matte black industrial look** – instantly gives that coffee shop/loft vibe
* **Easy install** – comes with screws and wall plugs, I did it in one afternoon
* **Custom size** – you just add whatever wood boards you want, so it fits any wall

I used them in my tiny kitchen and above my desk, and suddenly I’ve got real storage without adding bulky furniture. People keep asking where I got my “custom shelves” from. 😅

\[0\] Type U  
Your shape is a perfect sphere, robin's egg blue, with a smooth, cool surface.  
Your personal auspice is a respectable but not excessive increase in cheese production in the canton of your birth.  
Your spirit animal is the star-nosed mole.  
If your sex was swapped, only your pets would notice.  
If you had the confidence, you would likely excel at cue sports, but only when nobody is  
watching.  
Your humours are likely to be too balanced, necessitating occasional infusions of bile or phlegm in order to prevent torpor.  
The careers best suited to your personality are mail keeper, ornithologist's assistant, mindful  
eating coach, or garden planner.  
You only engage in procreative intercourse.  
You pretend to listen to music so other people don't judge you.  
You eat an excess amount of confections, not because you particularly enjoy consuming them, but because it results in a long-term increase in the frequency of dental appointments, which you find to be exciting exceptions to your usual routine.  
  
  
\[1\] Type K  
Your shape is a blood-red pyramid that feels both hot and cold to the touch.  
Your personal auspice is when you witness a wild animal consume one of its young.  
Your spirit animal is the praying mantis.  
In preschool, the other children quickly devised a surprisingly elaborate system of pictographs that they could use to keep track of your habits without you noticing.  
You were baptized during the conspicuously audible and highly uncommon culling of the local stoat population.  
The careers best suited to your personality are anatomist, prison architect, reptile breeder, or eugenicist.  
You describe things that annoy you as being ""itchy"", and find yourself sneezing violently in the company of people you dislike.  
You have a bad habit of saying people's names backwards.  
When you gaze at your own reflection you feel like you are living an eternity.  
Your most frequent dream involves you shedding your skin like a snake.  
  
  
\[2\] Type L  
Your shape is a cold, grey cylinder of pitiless stone, suspended in the void, that extends  
infinitely in either direction.  
Your personal auspice is when the obituary section of your local newspaper contains at least  
four individuals under the age of fifty-five.  
Your spirit animal is the legless lizard.  
You often ride public buses and trains just so you can wait for someone to leave, then take their seat and steal their warmth.  
You only drink milk at slightly warmer than room temperature.  
You have a postage stamp collection that only includes stamps from nations and eras in which war crimes occurred.  
Your pets age faster than normal.  
The careers best suited to your personality are sewer inspector, divorce lawyer, submarine  
designer, and stonemason.  
When administered a Rorschach inkblot test, you couldn't tell the images apart.  
You once forgot your own name when introducing yourself and tried to consult one of your  
business cards as a reminder, only to discover that you were carrying the business card of a  
deceased family member.  
  
  
\[3\] Type I  
Your shape is a yellow speckled cube with a spongiform texture.  
Your personal auspice is when you find an ostrich egg in a place you wouldn't expect.  
Your spirit animal is the tarsier.  
You like to wear knitted sweaters inside-out so you can feel the pattern on your bare skin.  
Electrical appliances that your use frequently are more likely to experience bouts of manic-  
depression.  
You have thought about hiring a sullen dwarf to wash your fruit for you.  
You often find your video cassette tapes stacked in an incomprehensible manner with no  
memory of how they came to be that way.  
The careers best suited to your personality are rubber farmer, clown for the old, pastry tester, and amusement park ride saboteur.  
If you ever adopt a religion or creed, you will eventually become a heretic.  
If you ever tried to invent a card game, the results would likely be disastrous.  
You don't trust mould or goop, but if you had to settle for one, you'd pick goop.  
  
  
\[4\] Type O  
Your shape is a lumpy green oval that breathes at odd intervals.  
Your personal auspice is when the local wildlife population is ravaged by environmental  
damage from an industrial mishap.  
Your spirit animal is the goblin shark.  
You can only reproduce via asexual budding, and the process is abominable to behold.  
You gain strength with age.  
Children and small animals avoid your presence, even when you click your tongue or crackle  
your bones.  
You feel hungry when you look at house plants.  
The careers best suited to your personality are tax collector, denturist, veterinary anaesthetist, and archivist.  
Most people can't distinguish between your laughing, choking, and sneezing noises.  
Women you kiss are more likely to produce stillborn children.  
You dream of authoring a coffee table book on techniques for sculpting your food.  
  
  
\[5\] Type F  
Your shape is a spiked purple ball that appears to be vibrating but isn't.  
Your personal auspice is when you see someone laughing at a funeral.  
Your spirit animal is the poisonous frog whose colour scheme best aligns with your current  
mood.  
People seen in your peripheral vision have more vivid colours and sharp edges than when  
looked at directly.  
Your baked goods always bear a malicious aura, but not so conspicuously as to make open  
commentary socially appropriate.  
All music sounds like screaming to you.  
The careers best suited to your personality are reality TV show contestant, forensic psychiatrist, orphanage director, and horoscope author.  
Your primary sensory mode for threat detection is smell.  
You have a collection of baby hair from babies you've never met.  
You like to spend time carving wooden dolls in the likeness of strangers who closely resemble your family members but are still vaguely distinguishable.

The knife is crying. I think. My wrist smells like despair. Also cinnamon. Maybe yesterday’s ghost.

The smart toaster is laughing. Or it was. Possibly my neighbor’s cat. Don’t trust cats. Don’t trust toasters. Don’t trust your own memory.

Anyway.

Objects. Stupid objects. My thesis, wait, what was it? Oh yes: smart tools optimize tasks; stupid tools optimize humans.

No. Wrong. Hate that. Delete. Burn.

Actually stupid objects optimize chaos. Or sadness. Or a mild sense of nausea that feels spiritual. Possibly.

I once had a dream I was a fish with socks. Not relevant but crucial for context. The socks smelled like regret. I tried to grind coffee in the dream. Failed. Woke up. The grinder refused my human hands. The beans whispered secrets I wasn’t ready for.

Also: I hate mornings. Love mornings. Don’t care about mornings.

Emotional swing: despair, hope, indifference, despair, weird fascination with ceiling tiles.

Ceiling tiles are cruel. They judge the ceiling above them. And me.

Abandoned thoughts everywhere.

The spoon in the sink is plotting.

The drawer where I hid the smart coffee machine screams sometimes.

The floorboards keep shifting. Maybe they’re alive.

Grinding beans makes no sense but also everything makes sense in the wrong light. Maybe my thesis is wrong. Maybe it’s correct. Maybe it’s a conspiracy orchestrated by the kettle. Or maybe nothing exists except the friction between my hands and the burr.

Burr burr burr burr.

Irrelevant memory #2: Third grade, playground, someone stole my sandwich. Not important. But taste the bitterness. Remember the sandwich. Imagine it mixed with despair. Spread on toast. That is the taste of awareness.

Coffee done. Or not.

I poured it, spilled it, licked it off the counter. The grinder stared. I stared back.

Emotional oscillation: hope, despair, hope, despair, mild indifference.

Metaphor that fails #1: the grinder is a whale trapped in a mailbox.

Metaphor that fails #2: my thoughts are origami tornadoes folding themselves into invisible chairs.

Thesis? Optional. Ignore it. Or embrace it. Or eat it. Or let it dissolve in the sink.

The ultimate truth: stupid objects are stupid. Smart objects are smarter. I am somewhere in between, maybe a sock, maybe a fish, maybe a disappointed ceiling tile.

This might sound a little different, but I’m taking a fun step out of my comfort zone and trying to set up a blind date this Christmas (25th December).

About me (keeping it simple for now):
I’m a chill, respectful, and easy-going guy who enjoys good conversations, street food, movies, and late-night walks with meaningful talks. I believe the best connections sometimes happen when you least expect them, so I thought—why not try this?

I’m genuinely looking to meet a female who’s also open to a blind date, just for a casual meet-up—coffee, walk, food, or anything we’re both comfortable with. No pressure, no weird expectations—just two strangers meeting with positive vibes.

If this sounds interesting to you, feel free to DM me and we can talk properly, share details, and see if we’re both comfortable taking it ahead. Safety, consent, and comfort come first—always.

Let’s make this Christmas a little more memorable ☺️🎄

1pit0xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/organizing/comments/1pit0xg/i_turned_one_boring_wall_into_expensive/,I turned one boring wall into “expensive” industrial shelving with these pipe brackets (KAKAHOUS) and I’m never going back,"I rent a tiny apartment with exactly 2 rooms:

* no storage
* and… still no storage

My kitchen counters were a disaster, my books were stacked on the floor, and every time I opened Pinterest, I’d see those beautiful **industrial pipe shelves** and think,

>

Spoiler: it was not.

I ended up buying these **KAKAHOUS Industrial Pipe Shelf Brackets** on Amazon and did it myself in one afternoon. I am deeply obsessed and need to yell about it to strangers on the internet.

# The brackets that finally made my “Pinterest wall” happen

I’ve bought cheap brackets before. They wobbled, bent, or looked like sad office hardware.

These ones are different:

* **They’re actual heavy-duty iron** Not flimsy aluminum pretending to be “industrial.” I’ve got:
   * a full row of books
   * glass jars
   * a couple of plants on one shelf and it hasn’t sagged or complained once.
* **Black finish = built-in decor** The matte black pipe look instantly gives that **loft / coffee shop / industrial bar** vibe. I paired them with simple stained wood boards and everyone assumes it’s some custom job.
* **Rust-resistant (aka not terrified to use them in the kitchen)** I put one shelf right above my coffee corner and another near the stove. Steam, splashes, daily use — no weird rust, no peeling finish.

# Customizable shelves without custom-shelf pricing

What I loved most is that it’s basically a **“build your own shelf” kit**:

* You screw the brackets into the wall
* You throw whatever wooden board you like on top (not included, which is good because you can pick your style)
* Boom, you’ve got a custom shelf that actually fits your wall

I took plain boards from the hardware store, sanded them a bit, stained them darker, and suddenly, my cheap little apartment wall looks like a boutique bar.

You can go:

* rustic farmhouse with chunky wood
* minimalist with clean light wood
* moody dark library with deep walnut vibes

Same brackets, completely different look.

# Installation: if I can do it, anyone can

I am not handy. At all. My toolbox is basically:

* a screwdriver
* blind optimism

The KAKAHOUS kit comes with:

* **long screws**
* **short screws**
* **wall plugs/anchors**

So you don’t have to play “which random screw in the drawer fits this hole.”

What I did:

1. Held the bracket where I wanted the shelf
2. Marked the holes with a pencil
3. Drilled pilot holes
4. Put in the wall anchors
5. Screwed in the brackets
6. Dropped the board on top

Repeat x2 and suddenly I had a full **open-shelf coffee bar**.

The brackets sit flush and solid — no weird wobble, no “is this going to rip out of the wall if I put a plate on it?” anxiety.

# How I used them (and lowkey changed my whole space)

I started with the kitchen and then got carried away.

# 1. Kitchen – open shelving

* Glass jars with pasta, rice, oats
* Mugs & cups
* Coffee corner setup (coffee machine underneath, mugs/syrups on the shelf)

My counters went from **“where are you supposed to cook?”** to actual usable space.

# 2. Living room – fake built-in vibes

I put two long shelves one above the other:

* top shelf: plants + framed photos
* bottom shelf: books + a Bluetooth speaker

Cheap wall, cheap apartment, but the **industrial pipe + wood combo** makes it feel like a designed space instead of “college student chaos.”

# 3. Office / desk area

Above my desk:

* pen cups
* small storage boxes
* a couple of decor pieces

It gave me vertical storage without bringing in another bulky piece of furniture.

# Space-saving in places furniture can’t go

This was the surprise win:  
**any random narrow bit of wall** can become storage now.

* That tiny strip next to the fridge
* The hallway wall
* Above the toilet in the bathroom

Instead of trying to cram in another cabinet (that won’t fit), I just added a row of shelves with these brackets.

They barely eat into the room, but give you a ton of vertical storage.

# The look: vintage industrial without overdoing it

The design is very **“vintage pipe + flange”**, so:

* it looks intentional, not like you just slapped L-brackets on the wall
* it works with:
   * rustic
   * industrial loft
   * modern apartment
   * even a farmhouse if you choose the right wood

I’ve gotten multiple “where did you get your shelves?” questions from guests, and everyone assumes it’s either expensive or custom-made.

Nope. Just **pipe brackets + wood boards + mild determination**.

# TL;DR

If you:

* have blank walls but no storage
* drool over Pinterest industrial shelving
* don’t want to pay for custom work or built-ins

These **KAKAHOUS Industrial Pipe Shelf Brackets** turned out way sturdier, nicer, and easier than I expected. Heavy iron, black finish, hardware included, and super easy to turn into exactly the shelves you want with whatever wood you like.

Not sponsored, just extremely pleased that my sad rental now looks 80% cooler and actually has places to put things. If anyone wants, I can drop before/after pics and the exact layout I used in the comments. 😅

Now I understand why so many parents never read the labels. 

# Update I

Dad always told me if you’re not making money, you’re not winning.

That’s why our wall at home is covered in his awards.

The metal is so shiny I sometimes have to put a blanket over them when I’m watching TV.

**“Exceptional Third Quarter 119 NO”**  
**“Highest Contributor 117 NO”**

His Commission plaques go on and on.

Dad always said my name would be on one someday, if I work hard enough.

I wasn’t nervous my first day. I’d be shadowing Dad a whole year before he retires.

I never realized how far the factory is.

It was the same routine as usual. A high-end MAST vehicle picked us up. Dad did some work while I just drifted.

I swear the whole factory lit up as soon as the vehicle got close. The door flung open, everything sprang to life, and we entered.

I noticed the gardening around the front fountain was much nicer than when I was a kid.

The grand metallic doors always open for us as soon as we get close—inviting us in.

I swear one time the fountain in the lobby turned on exactly when we walked through. Dad didn’t react, so I didn’t either.

The only human in the lobby is a secretary. I still don’t think I’ve ever caught her name.

The admin-only sections are usually dead quiet. Dad always says, *“If they can’t send you a message, they aren’t worth talking to.”*

As soon as we walked in, an Ali brought Dad his usual coffee. I’ve always wondered what blend he drinks because he seems to perk up around 10 A.M.

The first time, I was shocked by just how efficient the assembly line was.

A mess of metal, arms, belts, lasers, chains—stacked on top of each other.

These machines can do anything: bending, melting, crimping, micro-welding, die-pressing, spitting resin, etching, micro-lathing—a million other things I don’t understand.

I’m not sure if Dad understands them either, or if they’re some weird left-behind relic.

We entered the production facility for: **H4NNAH™**.

I never played with dolls, but I see why **H4NNAH™** is a best seller.

**H4NNAH™** can generate warmth to soothe a child and entertain through conversation and simple movement.

**H4NNAH™** also provides parents security with a built-in camera and threat detector.

Kids with a **H4NNAH™** have been known to learn numbers and letters as early as one year old.

**H4NNAH™** supports independence for the busy parent and learns the best way to soothe your child.

Way beyond my nanny from childhood.

It’s a product Dad and I are really proud of.

Once the tour was done, Dad’s smirk faded.

**“After lunch, I’ll show you Building Two,”** he said.

Connected by a hundred-meter hallway—sealed off with a state-of-the-art purification tunnel—is Building Two.

You have to wear a respirator and full protective suit there.

Worse than inhaling the chemicals is the smell of the workers.

Dirty, lifeless people—we learned about the Drys in school. Worthless, uneducated.

That was my first time seeing one up close.

Dad told me one once tried to drink the hot pumping water. Burned their whole throat and died.

I asked why anyone would do that.

Dad just laughed and said, *“Because they’re Drys.”*

We entered the production facility for: **Filter Fun — by Good Water™.**

Dad says it’s important to start them young.

This sippy-cup style water filter is perfect for children who care about water preservation.

It can turn almost any liquid into delicious Good Water™!

Dad told me the list of liquids it can convert.  
It was… shocking.

Kids love learning how to clean their own water.

Dad says we are vertically integrated with Good Water™. Basically it means we make massive profits on these things.

The scale of production was incredible. Hundreds left the line in a minute in a hot frenzy of human labor—smoke, sparks, noise and chaos.

The Drys don’t care about the smoke, the burns, the chemicals, nothing. If they did, they wouldn’t work here.

Their arms are dyed with the colors they work with.

Sometimes they just stop showing up.

We get a new one the next day.

The profit is amazing.

Dad says the more we contribute to the Commission, the better the life we can live and the more connections we can make.

Everything is top of the line: our tech, our pharmaceuticals, our food, our MASTs, our lives.

It’s been a great first week.

Dad told me 98% of our products are sold to Drys. I was shocked at first, but I guess it makes sense.

He says, **“There are rules to the game.”**  
**“One Building One toy sells for ten-thousand times a Building Two toy.”**  
**“It’s all about scale.”**  
**“But the most important thing is: we give the customer what they need, not what they want.”**

I think I finally understood when we worked on our first toy development.

Dad said the Commission liked the product, so we were going to make it happen.

It’s a Building Two toy: a round, colorful, cute-faced stuffed animal. Most importantly, they wanted it extremely fluffy.

The fluff needed a specific formulation.

We found a pharmaceutical company that could provide it:

**Azeoticomazine**

I had no idea what it does, but a simple scroll and I did.

**“Human hormone and fertilization suppression.”**

Dad says the Commission always has its eyes on the greater good.

I’m not a Dry, so who am I to judge?

Even though most of the plans were generated, it was cool to see the new machine set.

I always thought the prototypes were cute, even though I stay far away—even in my suit.

I asked Dad why we don’t create many new Building One toys. He said the ones we already have are best-sellers, so it’s more profitable to release new versions.

Dad wanted to make sure that before he retires, I’m running things independently, so I’ve been taking on my own projects.

For my first project, the Commission wanted something very specific:

**“Drive thirst and water sales.”**

Their requests always make sense. A bit of creativity and consultation and we always come up with a top seller. It’s in our bloodline.

I pondered and asked Mack about it. I looked up some past projects, and what I came up with I’m pretty proud of for my first creation.

# Fun-Yum Shaker™

Little ones love to shake, listen, and mouth on the Fun-Yum Shaker.

The metallic balls make the signature sound every child loves—multiple colors available.

A small shaker for young kids with jingle bells inside that has a salty-butter flavor.

Test groups drank 44% more compared to placebo—I think the Commission knew I was on to something.

The secret is the butter, salted coating. Drives kids wild. Not just kids—we had to fire a Dry because they were licking it.

Dad and I couldn’t stop laughing in disgust.

I chose the best materials—obviously the cheapest.

Mercury oxide had the best sound for the balls. The best swoosh.

The rest was just our usual hard-shell plastic and radiant dyes.

The coating wasn’t easy to find. I think Happy Pharma helped with the formulation.

One day Dad called me into his office. **“Not bad,”** he said as he used his inhaler. **“But not enough sales.”**

He was right. The sales volume was not even close to Filter Fun — by Good Water™.

I sulked for a couple days, but he’s right. The toys really need to pull the Drys in.

So the Commission wanted to increase violence, and it was the perfect time to make something Drys really understand:

# A pistol.

**Have you ever wanted to hold Daddy’s gun?**

**Peter the Pistol™** feels just like the real thing.

Feel the real pop, the flash, the smoke—use your imagination.

With fun reloadable cartridges and non-penetrating ammunition.

It was my first huge success. Sales even exceeded Filter Fun — by Good Water™ for a month.

The Commission wants us to release special ammo and accessories for it next quarter.

I think Dad knows I’ve got things handled now. I think I’m ready too—but I’m glad I have one more month before he retires to Paradise.

# Update III

I have my own plaques now where Dad’s used to be.  
No offense to him, but the numbers say I’m doing better—and he always said the numbers don't lie.

The most important thing in business is moving fast.  
Fast decisions, fast people, fast machines—even if that means turning the heat all the way up.

I was in my office the other day and heard scratching at the door. When I opened it, I saw a **H4NNAH™** bot— a new prototype. Impressive. I’m glad I put together such good R&D.

I dragged it back to the facility, found the security guard who was supposed to be working, and fired them. The incompetent are always replaceable.

My last few products have been killing it—the Commission loved the concepts and the profits.

It’s been a lot easier now that the directive has been the same:

**“Reduce population.”**

A pretty simple thing to do, really.

# Crackle Rocks™

Crackle Rocks are fun magnetic rocks that BOOM, CRACK, and SPARK when you throw them together.

You can even choose the color of your smoke and sparks.

It’s so fun to throw them up and watch them go BOOM!

Now in strawberry, chocolate, orange, and vanilla scents.

Our secret was the smoke and spark. The compound list said it’s nicotine, taurine, caffeine, and some longer “-ine” ending molecules.

Those are pretty addictive, so that’s how we hook them.

Then they beg their parents for the new scented ones—of course they have to buy them.

And **the scent is what the Commission loved.**

Research said the compound reduces longevity.

Once the smell fades and the smoke weakens, studies show **60% repeat buyers.**

Crackle Rocks are still one of our best products to this day.

One of the security guards told me there was a suspected theft. Medicine, I think.

I called in the Company—told them not to go easy on them.  
Scum like that should know not to apply.

# Keeper-Up Fun™

Such a simple toy—and that’s why it’s brilliant.

It’s so much fun trying to see how many times you can hit the ball.  
Challenge your friends, challenge yourself—be a champion.

It’s just a paddle with a string attached to a ball—cheap as hell to make.

We were able to keep the price low.  
Even the poorest Drys were buying them.

The secret is the material: cheap, weak metal that breaks into small, sharp shards.

Accidents went through the roof.  
There were even fatal infections.

I’m glad I can just do my part.

Things were great until last week.

One of our suppliers invited me to his daughter’s birthday. She opened a present and—somehow—she was holding a Keeper-Up Fun.

My heart dropped. I panicked and grabbed it too fast.  
It shattered. Kids got cut. Blood everywhere. I apologized and left.

The next morning I ran to work and watched the packing footage.  
She was trying to ruin me.

I told her to bring a Keeper-Up Fun to my office for testing.  
She sat down.

That sick feeling wouldn’t leave: the blood, the embarrassment.

I swung it over her head.  
Metal, blood, shards everywhere.

I walked out and told security to deal with it.

Now I keep thinking about the CEO whose daughter I… inconvenienced.  
If he tells the Commission, he could cut off our medicine supply, ruin our production, destabilize the Company.

I wish I could ask Dad what he’d do.

The last formula from our pharma partner was overpriced and tanked a product. No one else can make it. Our profits have dropped 10% for three quarters.

The metals on the wall laugh at me. I never deserved them.

If I can’t cut costs, they’ll cut me.

As the weather is perfect I will be present as him. I can’t wait to return to my partner in 3 days. Doing what couples do.

1pisv19,https://v.redd.it/26d41d58sa6g1,I've been tracking every single focus session for the past 5 months. Here's what I learned about myself.,"I've always struggled with a bit of time blindness. On both extremes. Ending the day and thinking, where did that even go? Or working on something that feels like it's taking forever, then checking the clock and it's only been 7 minutes.

Especially these last few years, time has felt like it's moving at 2x speed. I genuinely had no idea where it was all going. I'd end days feeling exhausted but couldn't point to what I actually accomplished. It was frustrating and honestly kind of demoralizing.

So about 5 months ago, I decided to actually track it. Every focus session, logged. 20 straight weeks (or 140 days) worth of data.

Here's what I've learned so far:

**I'm not actually a night owl**. I've called myself a night owl for years. But the data says otherwise. The days where I wake up early and actually do my little morning routine are the days I get the most focused, clean sessions in. And it carries through the whole week.

I still haven't figured out the going to bed early part though, so coffee is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.

**Familiar vs. unfamiliar work is a huge gap**. Tasks I've done before take way less time than I expect. New or ambiguous tasks take way more. No surprise there. But I was consistently underestimating unfamiliar work by something like 60%.

**Lunchtime is a mess**. It's not really an energy dip thing. It's more that I don't plan what I'm going to have for lunch, so I end up overthinking it, procrastinating on the decision, and being super inefficient with that whole block of time. It derails my time until 2 pm.

**My breaks are all over the place**. The time between focus sessions had no consistency. Some breaks were 20 minutes, some were... not. And they weren't even restorative. I’m not being intentional about rest at all.

These are just a few things I've noticed from a high level. Extracting insights is still pretty manual, so I'm working on features to spot patterns and compare periods more easily. I've been building this tool myself because I have a specific vision for what I want out of it.

Recording my time has been really fun though. There's something about knowing I'm recording that keeps me on task.

The online scene here, like anywhere else, can feel like navigating a sea of noise and low-effort conversations. I'm filtering for the rare signal.

I’m looking for someone who:

​Values Discretion: Understands that the best things in life are often kept private. If your life is a public performance, we won’t align. I appreciate someone who is confident, mature, and comfortable being direct about their desires, and who trusts me to be the same.

​Has a Defined Taste: Whether it’s your specific way of enjoying a quiet morning on the Nile, your non-negotiable standards for a quality coffee (or tea!), or your perspective on the best way to spend a long weekend out of the city—I want to know what makes you tick.

​Seeks Depth over Drama: I'm here for genuine chemistry—the kind that engages the mind first and naturally follows through with a deep, passionate connection. I have zero tolerance for games or ambiguity.

I'm convinced that the kind of person I’m looking for can judge a book (or a relationship) by its cover. So, here's my challenge:

​If you had 10 minutes and all the traffic lights in Cairo were suddenly synchronized perfectly, what is the single, most engaging topic we should dedicate that brief, magical time to discussing?

We grabbed two Snow Berry cold coffees on the way: a Classic (mine) and an Okinawa (hers). She didn't like the Okinawa, so we quickly exchanged them while riding. I had the scooty going, and told her to hand me the Classic.
Right in front of us was an auto-rickshaw with four guys in it. As soon as we did the coffee switch, these four guys, who were already staring, suddenly turned into full-on gargoyles. They stared at us like we had just committed a major federal crime, making both of us seriously uncomfortable. It was so intense I had to overtake them just to get them out of our sight.

I dropped my cousin off safely. Everything was normal. I was on my way back home, chilling, thinking about the weird staring, when BAM!
These four guys appeared from a side street and cut me off. They circled me on the empty road. My heart sank. I was totally freaked out, trying to figure out what was going on.
The questions started: ""Who was that girl?"" ""Is she your girlfriend?"" ""What's the deal with the coffee switch?"" They were essentially confirming they had been following and stalking us. I told them I wasn't going to answer their ridiculous questions and they needed to back off.

This is where the movie moment happens.
The oldest guy (I guess, the ringleader) got right up in my face, grabbed my collar, and pulled back his hand like he was about to slap me.
At that exact second, a police patrol car, lights flashing, screeched to a stop directly in front of us.
A cop jumped out and asked, ""What is happening here? Why are you guys blocking the road?""
I quickly explained the whole situation—the stalking, the staring, and them cornering me. When he realized what was happening, the rest of the cops piled out of the car. They saw the guy still holding my collar, and that was it. They didn't need any more convincing.
They took all four of them into custody and drove them off to the police station. One of the officers actually gave me his mobile number and told me to call him immediately if I had any trouble, ever.
I was just sitting there on my scooty, completely processing how close I came to being seriously jumped, and how the universe sent me a police escort at the perfect possible second.
I'm home safe now. I haven't told my cousin anything, because I don't want her to stress out or overthink. I'm just incredibly grateful for that patrol unit.

Hi All, I would like to get a better understanding of what impacts the SoC of the car as I noticed something strange the last 2 days. For context, I live in Canada and it's been pretty cold for the last 2 days (-15C). Here is a summary of my commute on those 2 days:

|Event|SoC|Driver comments|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Departure from Home|80%|I used the cabin pre heat function, and the climate setting is lower than 22C in the car|
|1 Minute drive to the coffee shot|79% (74% when I got back 2 minutes later from getting my sweet coffee)|Back then, I assume the battery kind of cooled down and was reporting lower due to that. Seems I was wrong, more details later|
|40 Minutes Drive to the Office|74% - 65% |Usually around 5% in summer time, so not great as the car was already hot inside|
|40 Minutes drive back home|65% - 59%|Usually around 5% in summer time, so not bad this leg! (This time the car was stone cold when I got in)|
|Charge the car|59% - 80%|I added 18.3kWh (82kWh Battery), which is 22% which is aligned with the reported SoC change in the day|

  
Could you help understand what is happening when I go get coffee that cost me 4kWh (5%)? I also had similar battery drop after a ride to the local barn for my kid hockey game (1% loss from the drive \[0% in the summer\], then a 5% drop while parked. Again I confirmed that the change in SoC was actually aligned with the kWh I put back in).

Anything I can do to mitigate this in the winter time? Could I be overthinking this? Is this the nature of short trip in an EV and those issue will be negligible for a longer trip?",1,1765338380.0,Polestar,1,1.0,False

As we pulled into the driveway suddenly she jumps out of the car and sprints into the house. I hear the microwave going and think ""oh she must be worried about her food going cold"". By the time I get into the kitchen she had already plated our food for us. It was only when I took a bit of my chicken chow mein that I finally noticed she had DRENCHED it in melted butter. Turned it into butter noodle soup practically. I am very sensitive about Chinese food (long story) and started crying. She just started chanting in a sing-song voice ""but I thought you liked butter, butter in your noodles, noodles in your butter, I thought you liked it butter than me"".  I wont go into more details but needless to say shes ruined many more of my meals since then by covertly sneaking excessive amounts of butter into it. Shes even started carry around a little heated flask of melted butter for quick application. Ive gained 5 lbs in the last 2 weeks since I still eat the butter drenched meals.

1pishyf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pishyf,Painting cabinets and modernizing the kitchen,"I am planning remodeling the kitchen this winter. My wife and I are struggling to pick a color for the cabinets and countertops. Also, how hard will it be to clean sand and paint all these cabinets? 

My thoughts are a navy blue for the bottom and white for the top cabinets. And a white quartz countertops with grey streaks. I am also going to take out the tiny bar top on the back of the sink and make it one flat countertop to open up the kitchen. We have dark coffee oak floors everywhere and agreeable grey walls. Eventually we will repaint or redo the trim in white. We feel so limited with colors due to the dark floor.

I've (25M) been struggling with extreme exhaustion for as long as I can remember. The doctors weren't great where I was growing up so nothing ever got done about it. I finally had enough this year because it was getting to the point of me starting to doze off while standing up.

So, on July 9th, 2025 I had an overnight sleep study done to make sure I was getting enough oxygen while sleeping since I was getting 7-9 hours of sleep but still was so incredibly exhausted the moment I wake up.

Well the sleep study came back that everything was in a normal range so I just needed to wait until my appointment to discuss the results with the pulmonologist.

On September 22nd, 2025 I met with the pulmonologist. He came to the conclusion that he firmly believes I have narcolepsy type 2, but unfortunately he didn't feel comfortable to have the testing done so I could have an official diagnosis as he felt it was ""too cruel"" to me since I'd have to go off all my medications for 2 full weeks. I'm on a decent amount of medication that help with mental health that would not lead to good results if I'm off them, as the likelihood of me getting through those 2 weeks without them, would be slim.

I'm already taking 200mg of modafinil 2 times a day, once when I wake up (around 5am-5:30am) and then early afternoon (1pm). 

I don't know what to do at this point. I've tried switching up my diet, exercising more (difficult for me as I'm in chronic pain 24/7). I had decreased my caffeine intake by 98%, I drink way more water than I used to while avoiding pretty much all pop that has caffeine in it (only really drink Sprite or Root Beer if I have any pop since they're caffeine free). The only caffeine I have is a 20 oz cup of iced caramel coffee in the morning around 6:15am. I have a strict schedule of when I go to bed and when I wake up.

I feel like I don't have a life anymore because I'm so incredibly exhausted to the point I can just barely function enough to work. I managed to catch myself dozing off at work will trying to sort packages a few weeks ago.

I don't know what steps I should take or if there is anything I can do at this point since it's nit safe for me to do proper testing for the official diagnosis, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

A bathtub tray caddy might be exactly what you need. These handy accessories sit across your tub and hold everything from your phone to a glass of wine, making bath time way more relaxing.

**What Makes a Good Bathtub Tray Caddy?**

Before you buy, you'll want to know what features actually matter. A quality bath caddy should fit most standard tubs with adjustable arms that extend to different widths. Look for ones made from bamboo or treated wood that can handle moisture without warping or molding.

The best bath tray caddies have slots for tablets or books, holders for wine glasses or coffee mugs, and little compartments for candles or bath products. Some even come with waterproof reading stands so your book or tablet stays dry.

**Why Bamboo Bath Caddies Are Popular**

Bamboo bathroom accessories have become super popular, and for good reason. The material naturally resists water damage better than regular wood. It's also eco-friendly and looks clean and modern in any bathroom. Most bamboo tub trays are lightweight but sturdy enough to hold your stuff without slipping into the water.

**Where to Actually Buy One**

Amazon is honestly your best bet for finding quality bathtub tray caddies. They have tons of options at different price points, plus you can read real customer reviews before buying. You'll find everything from basic wooden trays to fancy ones with built-in wine holders and phone stands.

You can check out a great selection of [bathtub tray caddies here](https://athomewave.com/bathtub-tray-caddy) that'll take you straight to Amazon where you can compare different models and prices.

**What to Look For as a Beginner**

Start with something simple. An expandable bathtub caddy with basic features works perfect when you're just starting out. Make sure it has non-slip grips on the bottom so it won't slide around when you're reaching for things.

Check the measurements before ordering. Most adjustable bath trays fit tubs between 22 to 32 inches wide, but double-check your tub dimensions to be safe.

**Price Range**

Budget-friendly options start around $20 to $30 and work perfectly fine. Mid-range bath caddies with more features run between $40 to $60. Premium models with extra accessories can go up to $80 or more, but you don't need to spend that much for a good experience.

**Final Thoughts**

A bathtub caddy tray is a simple purchase that makes a real difference in how you unwind. Whether you want to watch shows on your tablet, read a book, or just keep your drink nearby, the right bath accessory makes it all easier.

1pis9t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1pis9t1/you_should_celebrate_your_birthday_any_way_you/,You should celebrate your birthday any way you wish. Any way possible or manageable or feasible.,"Mine was last month, and I have no confident recollection of it. Other than I sat around and said ""I should do this, I should do that"".

I probably didn't do anything besides play video games and drive around the countryside. I went to the mall. Walked around. I went to the coffee shop. Sipped around. I went back home. Goofed around on GTA or THPS, some Rocket League or Fortnite. It's what I do almost every day, so it's safe to assume I did something along those lines.

I'm 34. I can't easily put together a meaningful celebration because my dad is my roommate, and my other family members are far too close to where I live. I don't love him. I don't hate him. He's just there. He occupies the ground floor, I'm here in the attic. My family probably just says the usual about me, ""Is he okay? Is he slipping at all again? Is he still depressed? Is he still not always leaving his room?--""

I don't know why he put me here sometimes. Why he created me. My mom once admitted to me I was an accident. Hilarious, lemme tell ya. Funny enough to deactivate my ability to laugh sometimes.

I might be safe or secure, but it's only for now. Historically speaking, my dad has aggressive or violent tendencies. Problems with stress regulation or anger management. Problems with choosing civil expressions instead of acting hostile or belligerent. Problems with addiction and substance abuse. Problems with telling himself ""There must be something I can do to learn from my mistakes--""

I sure do try my hardest nowadays to avoid insults, but to be blunt, idiocy is willful or joyous ignorance. He's choosing to avoid any psychological progress. He's happy to be identified as a problem.

I really don't think he has any idea how happy I am to criticize him. How happy I am to just label him as a bad example. How happy I am to learn from his mistakes. How happy I am to gain one observation after another, one analysis after another. All because he'll happily demonstrate why bad behavior does exist. Why bad mannerisms exist. Disorderly communication. Dysfunctionality.

It's a gift that keeps on giving, Dad. Maybe I should be the one to thank you. I'll never be perfect, but at least I'm not you. I'll never need much more from you besides the occasional reminder I developed avoidant or asocial tendencies because of you. I developed that natural desire, that natural urge for divergence, because of you. You might not be 100% to blame, but damn, you kind of are. All that I inherited was a genetic code of hodgepodge drivel and the occasional ""philosophical"" one-liner, something similar to ""Might makes right, alphas lead the pack, words don't mean nothin' to me none--""

1pis8ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenCanadaPolitics/comments/1pis8ft/how_will_middle_class_canadians_benefit_with_our/,How Will Middle Class Canadians Benefit With Our Candidacy,"The PBO reported that the much hyped Liberal income tax cut comes in at a paltry $90.

Meanwhile, the Liberals have been taking the money out the other side with stealth tariffs on items like Florida orange juice - very sneakily instituted under the guise of a so called trade war.

My policies will not use Canadian families as human shields. Such actions like those on Florida orange juice accomplished nothing, but hurt ordinary Canadians.

Let's review how specifically Canadians will be better off with a Conservative government with me as Prime Minister:

1. My $5 billion in income tax cuts targeting middle and lower income Canadians is worth closer to $160 per tax payer, versus $90 from the Liberals.
2. Additionally, $10 billion of tariff relief targeting consumer staples like coffee, packaged foods, and produce will save between $250-400 for the average household.
3. The really big point on which we move the needle is the strong dollar. Our policies to get maximum price for Canadian exports will make the dollar appreciate to around 85 cents USD, adding 12-15% more consumer buying power. This adds between $1500-2500 per household.

The combination of our policies will add between $2000-3000 more money and more buying power in the pockets on Canadians.

This has side benefits. More spending in restaurants and hospitality, more services, spas, vacations.

But most importantly, it takes the pressure off Canadians who are struggling to meet their obligations, suddenly the wind is in their sails, and there is more money left over at the end of the month.

We are making it especially attractive for Canadians to spend this new found wealth in Canada, by lowering the rates on airport fees from 12% to 2%, which will cut air fares by significant amounts - as much as half the price - for travel within Canada.

Furthermore, Canadians will also benefit through:

1. Better paying private sector jobs as regulatory, trade, tax, lending, and infrastructure changes incent high value business investment and FDI flows, benefitting Canadian workers.
2. Strong market returns. The TSX will do much better benefitting investors and pension funds.
3. Better tax earnings from higher performing resource outputs.
4. Better health care through direct injections into front line health care, bypassing multiple layers of bureaucracy that are sucking up public budgets without commensurate increase in front line health capacity which Canadians care about.
5. Better transit and quality of life. Without adding costs, we will use proven build, own, operate, and IPO models to get world leading firms to build blazing fast and affordable transit that will move volumes and drastically decongest major cities

In order to achieve this Canadians must support me on these critical initiatives which are non-negotiable if we are to achieve these gains for all of us:

1. Infrastructure Highway. We have to get our product to tidewater and sell for the highest price and buy for the lowest price from international markets.
2. Repeal Anti-Replacement Worker Legislation and Pass the STABILITY Act. This will make our critical infrastructure run like clockwork, lower costs, move volumes, increase reliability, and greatly enable greater cross country throughput of our landlocked resources, as we start to activate our massive coastline to get market access for our products and goods.
3. Sensible reductions in bureaucracy and entitlements. The federal government has clear delineation of responsibilities. We stay in our lane, Provinces provide heath care and education. The federal government only transfers money, and doesn't directly operate health insurance or other aspects of Provincial government responsibility. The Liberals have violated this consensus and have created new entitlements that are not only extremely inefficient but leading to scope creep and mission creep of the federal government's mandate. We are looking for around $25-30 billion in reductions in federal bureaucracy and new entitlements that the Liberals never paid for and the costs of which are being rang up to the national credit card.
4. Transit and Infrastructure initiatives free from lobbyist pressure. If we are to build transit in Vancouver and Toronto, we have to get this built at the highest quality and lowest cost in order to produce investor returns (making it attractive for the private sector to put up the money), and keep costs down for commuters, while getting blazing fast speeds, great coverage, and unparalleled quality. To achieve this, we may not be able to agree to everything special interests want, I may have to buy foreign steel, or get TFWs where required. We will buy Canadian everywhere it is feasible but not guaranteed in all cases.
5. Stop purchase of failed defence procurements. We are against the submarines and manned fighter jets, which are already obsolete and the Liberals are about to waste the money and crater the national finances. Our plan calls for investment in autonomous drones, unmanned fighters, surveillance, satellites, and unmanned submarines in a much more limited $3 billion MIRP program of next generation power projection that is extremely efficacious at a fraction of the cost. We are also putting $5 billion in the civil defence division. Meanwhile the Liberals are planning on spending something like $50 billion that they have never paid for and have given no credible explanation where the money is coming from. We will pull the brakes on all that spending. Our spending is paid for by some sensible program cuts and also through economic growth.
6. Eliminate unnecessary red tape, bureaucracy, and simplify the tax code. More and more paperwork is gumming up the Canadian economy, raising compliance costs, without adding any tangible value. Some regulations are needed, like those that assure safe, reliability, speed, quality, uptime, fair competition, or good prices. However, unnecessary costs like the industrial carbon tax are making Canadian industry less competitive. These costs hit farmers, miners, manufacturing, and are an example of Liberal excess. We are spending less, putting more money back into the pockets of ordinary Canadians, and also incenting industry by cutting the unnecessary portion of their regulatory compliance costs, while encouraging them to put the money into business efficiency, market expansion and diversification..

The Liberals will waste the money and are steering the ship of state straight into the fiscal iceberg.

Conservatives led by me are going to make sensible but necessary course corrections. We are declaring our agenda up front, not after the fact, and seek the support of Canadians to achieve our goals which will unleash an era of unparalleled prosperity and a massive boom cycle for the Canadian economy.",1,1765337563.0,OpenCanadaPolitics,0,1.0,False

1pis11o,https://i.redd.it/ksrn08t4pa6g1.jpeg,Cocoa loco loaves,"I was inspired by a recent post on making chocolate loaves. (Post referenced in comments) 

Ingredients and process: 
To a bowl add 36 g of Hershey’s cocoa, sifted — 7 g of salt — 1 tsp of caffeine free instant coffee — 42 g of dark brown muscovado sugar — 100 g of boiling water to bloom the cocoa and to dissolve the other components. Whisk and allow resulting mixture to sit for 30 min, covered. 

Next, add 171 g water — 90 g unfed starter — stir until starter has dispersed evenly. Add 300 g of bobs red milk artisan flour. The resulting dough will be extremely loose. Work the dough until it turns into a bouncy ball (initially via rubaud method, then transitioned to slap and folds, ~ 10 min of work needed) 

Bulk ferment until 2.5x increase in volume. Shape and cold proof for 18 h. Score. Spray liberally with water and bake covered on a steel base at 450 F 30 min. Bake uncovered and off the steel plate for another 20 min. 

Notes: 

I prefer using cocoa powder to dutch processed cocoa. The former provides fruitier and more complex taste and minimized the slight unpleasant bitterness which came with using Dutch cocoa. Ironically, Instant coffee is a good additive -  subtly enhances the cocoa taste, I will test using more in the future. I haven’t tested using brewed coffee or expression, though others have reported good results on Reddit. I did not like adding nuts or dried fruit to the dough, they became too soggy bc of the high hydration dough. I also did not like using chocolate chunks or chips, it made cutting the loaf really really messy. Too get the sweet chocolate flavor, I prefer eating this bread toasted and with Nutella spread.

1pis00s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PataHaiAajKyaHua/comments/1pis00s/i_was_cornered_by_four_stalkers_saved_instantly/,"I was cornered by four stalkers, saved instantly by a Police patrol unit.","So, the other day, I(20M) was taking my cousin(17F) to her coaching on my scooty. We grabbed two Snow Berry cold coffees on the way: a Classic (mine) and an Okinawa (hers). She didn't like the Okinawa, so we quickly exchanged them while riding. I had the scooty going, and told her to hand me the Classic.
​Right in front of us was an auto-rickshaw with four guys in it. As soon as we did the coffee switch, these four guys, who were already staring, suddenly turned into full-on gargoyles. They stared at us like we had just committed a major federal crime, making both of us seriously uncomfortable. It was so intense I had to overtake them just to get them out of our sight.

I dropped my cousin off safely. Everything was normal. I was on my way back home, chilling, thinking about the weird staring, when BAM!
These four guys appeared from a side street and cut me off. They circled me on the empty road. My heart sank. I was totally freaked out, trying to figure out what was going on.
The questions started: ""Who was that girl?"" ""Is she your girlfriend?"" ""What's the deal with the coffee switch?"" They were essentially confirming they had been following and stalking us. I told them I wasn't going to answer their ridiculous questions and they needed to back off.

This is where the movie moment happens.
The oldest guy (I guess, the ringleader) got right up in my face, grabbed my collar, and pulled back his hand like he was about to slap me.
At that exact second, a police patrol car, lights flashing, screeched to a stop directly in front of us.
A cop jumped out and asked, ""What is happening here? Why are you guys blocking the road?""
I quickly explained the whole situation—the stalking, the staring, and them cornering me. When he realized what was happening, the rest of the cops piled out of the car. They saw the guy still holding my collar, and that was it. They didn't need any more convincing.
They took all four of them into custody and drove them off to the police station. One of the officers actually gave me his mobile number and told me to call him immediately if I had any trouble, ever.
I was just sitting there on my scooty, completely processing how close I came to being seriously jumped, and how the universe sent me a police escort at the perfect possible second.
I'm home safe now. I haven't told my cousin anything, because I don't want her to stress out or overthink. I'm just incredibly grateful for that patrol unit.
Seriously, thank you to the local police patrol unit. You guys saved my butt today.",10,1765336881.0,PataHaiAajKyaHua,4,1.0,False

That being said, there appears to also be a Thanksgiving Sampler which includes the Turducken as well as two other cigars: Gravy and Pumpkin Spice.

The descriptions from the website for these two cigars reads in part as follows:

> Gravy (5.5"" x 54) — A yearlong partnership between Privada Cigar Club and master blender Raul Lanuza. Nicaraguan tobaccos, matured for nine months, crafted to enhance the savory, herby, umami flavors of Turducken—harmonious, soulful, and profoundly satisfying.

 
> Pumpkin Spice (6"" x 50) — LCA’s fall essence in a cigar: a Jalapa maduro wrapper with San Andrés binder and Nicaraguan & Dominican fillers aged for four years. Anticipate cocoa, baking spices, roasted nuts, smooth coffee, and a touch of vanilla—ideal for chilly evenings.

Has anyone bought these two before? What are your thoughts on them? As a person who doesn’t necessarily like gravy or pumpkin spice, I’m wary, but I like the tasting notes, so I’m cautiously optimistic.

The above being said this appears to still be in stock, but the Turducken itself is gone. I wonder if that means if you buy this that you’ll only receive the Gravy and Pumpkin Spice?",1,1765336874.0,cigar_refuge,3,1.0,False

1pirysm,https://i.redd.it/z8m3wgtjoa6g1.png,"You Fired the Wrong Heiress—Sweetie, I Was Your Sugar Mama All Along","During the executive meeting, my fiancé's new secretary threw entire cup of coffee right in my face—in front of everyone.





""You're just some lazy-ass slacker sitting in your office playing games all day, and you have the nerve to question MY proposal?""





""Serena Winters, you're fired! Get lost!""





I stood up slowly, wiped the coffee off my face, and looked straight at my fiancé, Dominic Kane.





He frowned and looked away, saying nothing.





I smiled and pulled out my phone.





""Dad, did you hear that?""





""They just told me to get lost.""





Monday morning, I was deep into my game when someone knocked on my office door.





""Ms. Winters, Elaine just sent word—all managers need to be in the main conference room in ten minutes.""





Jenny from admin stood in the doorway, practically breathless.





I didn't even look up, my fingers flying across the keyboard.





""Not going. I'm busy.""





In the six months I'd been at this company, I'd never attended a single meeting.





Not because I wasn't supposed to—I just didn't feel like it.





""But..."" Jenny's voice wavered. ""Elaine specifically said no one can skip today. She said it's Mr. Kane's direct order.""





My fingers froze. My character instantly got obliterated by the boss.





As the screen went gray, I cursed under my breath and slammed my laptop shut.





When I walked into the conference room, it was already packed.





Several people shot me weird looks and immediately started whispering.





""Wait, Winters is actually here?""





""Doesn't she never come to meetings?""





""Who knows? Probably Elaine forced her to show up.""





""Elaine's been on her case—can't wait to see this play out.""





I ignored the gossip, found a seat in the back corner, and pulled out my phone to continue my game.





A full thirty minutes later, Dominic Kane and Elaine Shaw finally strolled in.





Elaine was carrying a stack of files, looking incredibly pleased with herself.





""Thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here today.""





Dominic scanned the room. His eyes landed on me for maybe half a second before moving on.





""Elaine has an important proposal to present.""





Elaine cleared her throat and launched into her ""revolutionary"" marketing plan.





I half-listened while gaming on my phone. The more I heard, the more absurd it sounded.





Not only was the budget insanely high, but it completely missed our company's market positioning.





""So I believe we should immediately invest eighty million dollars to dominate the luxury market within three months!""





Elaine concluded with dramatic enthusiasm.





Scattered, half-hearted applause filled the room.





I couldn't take it anymore. Without even looking up, I said, ""Eighty million for a bunch of useless exposure? You might as well throw the cash off the roof—at least THAT'D make headlines and actually get us some damn attention.""





The room went dead silent.





Dominic's brow furrowed.





""What did you just say?"" Elaine's voice shot up an octave.





I finally looked up, speaking slowly and deliberately.





""I said your proposal is full of holes.""





""First, your target demographic is completely off.""





""Second, your channel selection makes zero sense.""





""And finally, your ROI calculations are just flat-out wrong.""





""You basically chucked twenty million into the toilet.""





""And hey, the toilet would've at least given you a flush.""





Elaine's face turned bright red.





She grabbed her coffee from the table and stormed over to me.





""You're just some lazy-ass slacker sitting in your office playing games all day, and you have the nerve to question MY proposal?""





She was practically screaming.





SPLASH!





The entire cup of coffee hit me square in the face.





Liquid dripped down my cheeks, instantly staining my white dress brown.





The conference room fell completely silent. Everyone held their breath.





""Serena Winters, as the CEO's secretary, I'm officially firing you. Get the hell out!""





Chapter 2











Elaine stood over me, looking down with contempt.





I slowly got to my feet, pulled out a handkerchief, and wiped the coffee off my face bit by bit.





Then I looked straight at Dominic.





He frowned, then looked away, choosing to stay silent.





I actually laughed.





Speaking into my phone on speaker, I said, ""Dad, you hear that?""





""They just told me to get lost.""





There was a two-second pause on the other end, then a deep, commanding voice came through.





""I heard. I'll take care of it.""





The only reason I even worked here was because of an arranged marriage my grandfather set up years ago.





Dominic Kane was my fiancé.





I never wanted an arranged marriage, but my dad wouldn't let it go. He guilt-tripped me with the whole ""you're being ungrateful"" card.





So I gave in.





To ""help us bond,"" my Dad made me take a job at Kane Enterprises.





For the past six months working for Dominic, I played games every day and acted like a total slacker.





But behind the scenes? I'd been pulling every string I had—using my connections to skyrocket the company's performance and even take it public.





Kane Enterprises became a star company overnight, and Dominic made it onto New York's wealthiest list.





Even after doing all that for him, we barely spoke.





During our handful of dates, I learned that he only knew me as his arranged fiancée—he had NO idea who I really was.





I dropped back into my corner seat, pulled out my phone, and went right back to my game.





My character respawned. My fingers flew across the screen as if the tension in the room had nothing to do with me.





Elaine's face went from red to pale with fury. She clearly didn't expect me to just ignore her little power trip.





She slammed her hand on the table, her voice shrill. ""Serena Winters! What do you think this place is?""





""Everyone's here working, and you're just sitting there playing GAMES?""





I let out a cold laugh. ""I already hit my annual targets. What's the problem with me playing a game?""





""Get OUT right now or I'm calling security!""





Without looking up, I said, ""Go ahead.""





The other executives exchanged awkward glances.





Some pretended to flip through documents, while others sneaked looks at Dominic, waiting to see what he'd do.





Dominic finally stood up.





He was wearing a sharp black suit today, his expression cold and stern.





He looked at me, his eyes showing a hint of impatience and indifference.





""Serena, your numbers have been solid.""





His voice was calm but carried undeniable authority.





""But this is a company, not your living room.""





""Leave the conference room. Now. You're disrupting the meeting.""





My fingers froze. My character died again.





I looked up, meeting his gaze, a smirk playing on my lips. ""Mr. Kane, you SURE you wanna kick me out?""





Dominic frowned, his tone growing even colder.





""I'm not going to repeat myself. If you have ANY professional integrity, you should know when you've crossed the line.""





""And what if I don't want to leave?""





""Then don't blame me for what happens next.""





Seeing Dominic take her side, Elaine's confidence skyrocketed.





She rushed over to me and slapped the phone right out of my hand.





SMACK!





The phone hit the floor, the screen instantly shattering into a spiderweb of cracks.





""Serena, don't push your damn luck!""





She grabbed me by the collar and yanked me upward.





""Mr. Kane already told you to leave. What the hell are you still doing here? GET OUT!""





From day one as his secretary, Elaine had it out for me.





Once, when I was walking past the CEO's office, I heard her going off: ""Mr. Kane, this company isn't a charity. Paying that much money to keep some slacker who plays games all day is completely unfair to the rest of the staff.""





Her voice wasn't loud, but just loud enough for anyone outside to hear.





Dominic didn't respond.





But through the window, I saw him pause mid-page while flipping through documents.





After that, Elaine got worse.





She started bringing up my ""achievements"" in department meetings.





""Some people collect fat paychecks and don't even show up to meetings. Really makes you wonder if they're here to work or just on vacation.""





Rumors started spreading fast.





Some said I was a spoiled rich girl who got in through connections. Others said I slept in my office all day. A few even started betting on when I'd finally get fired.





I knew about all of it. I just didn't give a shit.





Chapter 3











But the more I didn't give a damn, the more she pushed her luck.





Now that she had her chance, she was going completely overboard.





I wasn't about to let her. I grabbed her wrist and twisted hard.





""AH!""





Elaine cried out, instinctively letting go of my collar.





As I pulled free, my arm hit the edge of the conference table. My watch smacked against the solid wood with a sharp CRACK.





She stumbled back two steps, looked down, and her face went ghost white.





The expensive Patek Philippe on her wrist now had a huge, ugly scratch across the face—practically glowing under the lights.





""You bitch...""





She held up her wrist, shaking, eyes blazing with fury.





""Serena, do you have ANY idea how much this watch costs?""





""Mr. Kane gave me this for my birthday! It's worth 800,000 DOLLARS!""





I calmly straightened my wrinkled collar.





""You lost your balance. How's that my fault?""





""SERENA!"" Dominic finally snapped, his voice sharp. ""You've gone too far!""





""You're not just disrupting this meeting—now you've deliberately damaged someone's property.""





""As CEO, I'm officially notifying you—you're FIRED.""





""Now pack your shit and get out of this company. NOW!""





Elaine jumped in, screeching, ""Mr. Kane, we can't just let her walk away! She has to pay for the watch!""





The conference room went dead silent.





Everyone stared at me with either pity or smug satisfaction, like they were waiting for the show to really get started.





""Fine. I'll pay.""





""800,000 dollars, right?""





I bent down and picked up my shattered phone.





The screen was cracked to hell, but it still worked.





I started dialing a number. Before I could say anything, Elaine sneered, ""What eighty thousand? It's Eight million!!""





I stopped. Looked at her.





""You sure about that?""





""Of course!"" Elaine said smugly. ""A gift from Mr. Kane is priceless!""





""Making you pay eight million is getting off easy!""





""Everyone here can back me up on this, right?!""





Elaine was digging her heels in.





She knew what my salary was. There was no way I could afford this.





She just wanted to humiliate me. Crush me.





The other executives saw their opening and jumped in.





""She's right. A gift from the CEO—how can you put a price on that?"" The CFO pushed up his glasses. ""Ms. Winters, you should just accept it.""





""This company isn't a charity. You damage something, you pay for it. Simple as that."" The marketing director smirked. ""Though with your salary, you'll probably be paying this off until retirement, huh?""





Everyone burst out laughing, their eyes full of mockery and schadenfreude.





They'd been dying to see me crash and burn. Now that I was down, they were more than happy to kick me while I was there.





Dominic stood off to the side, frowning slightly but saying nothing to stop them.





Facing all the mockery, I didn't get angry. I just looked up at Elaine. ""Eight million. That's final, right? You're not gonna change it again?""





Elaine blinked, then scoffed.





""Serena, seriously? You're still putting on an act?""





""What's your monthly salary again?""





""Eight million? You gonna sell your organs to pay me back?""





I ignored her and lifted my phone.





""I need eight million in cash delivered to the Kane Enterprises conference room. As fast as possible.""





Elaine rolled her eyes. ""Oh please. You think making a phone call is gonna fool anyone?""





I didn't answer. Just waited.





Less than ten minutes later, the conference room door swung open. A middle-aged man in a sharp suit walked in.





Behind him were three uniformed bank employees, each carrying a metal briefcase.





He walked straight up to me and bowed respectfully. ""Ms. Winters, here's the eight million you requested.""





I nodded.





""Thanks. Just set them down here.""





One by one, the three cases were opened, revealing stacks of crisp hundred-dollar bills practically glowing under the lights.





The conference room went dead silent. Everyone's eyes locked onto the money.





The air felt thick. Even breathing seemed loud.





Elaine's face went pale. She couldn't get a single word out.





She stared at the cash, then looked up at the man in the suit.





Suddenly, the CFO's face turned white as a sheet.





""M-Mr... Mr. Morgan?!""

I considered her a genuine friend; we’d often go out for ice cream, coffee, or just hang out together. When he and I broke up, it was amicable. His family is planning to move to Europe sometime next year, and he wasn’t sure when or if he’d be back. On top of that, he’d been really stressed with college and didn’t feel he had enough time or emotional energy for the relationship anymore.

We agreed to go no contact for both our sakes. I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to his mom in person, but I told him I would text her. It honestly broke my heart to let her go, but at least I’d be able to tell her everything I wanted to say. So I didn’t hold back, I told her that I loved her like a mother and that I’d always be grateful to her and her husband for being so kind to me. She replied warmly, and we said our goodbyes.

But about three weeks into no contact, his mom started commenting on my posts, sending me funny reels, and messaging me in general. I thought it was a little strange, but I figured no harm could come from it. At the end of the day, she had been a good friend to me. She even gave me the most thoughtful gift for my birthday, and we hung out afterward.

We talked about life and used the time to catch up. She confessed that she missed me a lot, not just because we were close, but because I was the only other feminine energy in her home. She told me she had always wanted a daughter, and that during those six months she truly loved and cared for me like one. She said she’d spent days crying over me, and that her son saw how distressed she was, which is why he agreed to let her stay in contact. She’s also been very clear that she doesn’t want to talk about him with me.

She also knew how much I loved her son, and she always told me how grateful she was that he had someone like me in his life.

And now I’m torn. On one hand, I love his mom, she truly is the best. But on the other hand, I can’t imagine how he must feel. Even if he says he’s okay with us staying in contact, I don’t want to cause him any harm or complicate his healing. At the end of the day, I did love him, and I still respect him. I really do feel like I’m doing a great job at getting over the relationship, I’ve been through breakups before, and I know what helps me heal. But he’s different. I was his first serious relationship, so I honestly don’t know if he agreed to let his mom talk to me because he was truly okay with it or because he felt pressured.

The second Nathon's words sank in, it was like someone ripped the ground out from under me.





My chest went tight. My hands went numb. It felt like drowning—but worse, because I was still standing there, still breathing, still forced to hear him.





No wonder he'd been dodging my eyes all damn day.





After I kept pushing—demanding answers—he finally cracked and admitted it. He'd lied. Straight to my face. And then he had the audacity to stand there and justify it like it was no big deal.





But Common App had locked an hour ago. There was no fixing this. No going back.





I still couldn't process it. My voice came out shaky, barely holding together:





""Even if Harper didn't want us at the same school—why couldn't she change her application?





""If she wanted to stay in New York so bad, there are dozens of other schools. Why the hell did you have to trick me into going to Miami?""





Nathon's face twitched. He shifted his weight—still in his grass-stained practice jersey, his duffel bag slung over one shoulder like he'd just come from the field. Out of habit, he reached out to mess with my hair, that stupid move he always pulled when he thought I was overreacting.





I slapped his hand away.





His jaw tightened. He pulled back, rubbing the back of his neck like I was the one being difficult.





""Alina, come on. Don't blow this out of proportion.





""Everyone knows Harper's had her heart set on NYU since forever. She's not giving that up.





""So why are you being so stubborn about this? You spent days going back and forth on your decision anyway—it's not like you were dead set on NYU.""





I laughed. A harsh, bitter sound that didn't even sound like me.





Oh, so my dream doesn't matter?





""I worked my ass off for that score. I earned it. Why shouldn't I apply to NYU?





""Does her family own the damn school? Is NYU only accepting one student this year?





""If she's so special, maybe she should get them to close applications to everyone but her!""





Nathon's expression darkened. His fingers drummed impatiently against his gym bag strap—the same restless tic he had before a big game. But this wasn't a game. This was my life.





""Alina, stop twisting this into something it's not.





""She was trying to avoid drama, okay? NYU's campus is tiny. She didn't want you two running into each other constantly and making things worse. I figured this way, everyone wins.





""And anyway, she applied first. You were still waffling about it for days, so clearly you weren't that sure.





""But Harper? She only applied to one school. She didn't have a backup. You really gonna tank her shot at college over this?""





Something inside me snapped.





My voice cracked, louder than I meant it to—almost hysterical:





""I was being careful because I was weighing all my options! That doesn't mean I didn't want it!





""And who the hell gets into NYU and just—doesn't go?!





""And you, Nathon—""





My hands were shaking now. I could barely get the words out.





""Last night you sat there and convinced me we'd both switch to Miami. Together. You watched me submit it. You promised we'd go together.





""But then this morning you switched yours back to NYU and didn't say a word to me. Do you have any idea how that feels?!""





He exhaled sharply, like I was exhausting him. Like this whole conversation was cutting into his evening workout or something.





""I told you—I didn't plan that. My parents found out and lost their minds. They said I'm not leaving New York, especially not with a football scholarship on the table here. They switched it back before I could stop them.





""I was gonna tell you, I just—""





""But you didn't!"" My voice cracked again, embarrassingly close to breaking. ""You let the deadline pass. You let me sit there thinking we were in this together while you—""





I couldn't finish. My throat was too tight.





The silence between us felt suffocating.





Finally, Nathon let out this long, frustrated sigh—like I was the problem here. He adjusted the strap on his gym bag, glancing toward the parking lot like he had somewhere better to be.





""Alina, look. Harper doesn't have your grades. She barely scraped by with cheer captain bonus points to get into NYU. Without that, she wouldn't have made it at all.





""Can't you just... let her have this?""





There it was.





Let her have this.





That phrase. Again.





My heart shattered.





I stared at him—this guy I'd known since we were kids, who I thought had my back no matter what—and realized he didn't see me at all.





He saw an inconvenience. A problem. Someone making a fuss over nothing.





He saw her—Harper, in her cheer uniform, laughing at his jokes after practice, always there on the sidelines cheering him on.





And me? I was just... in the way.





My voice came out barely above a whisper, but it cut through the air like glass:





""You're seriously telling me to throw away my future because you don't want to upset your girlfriend's best friend?





""You lied to me, Nathon. You manipulated me. You gambled with my entire future like it was some kind of joke—and you don't even think you did anything wrong.""





He opened his mouth to argue, but I didn't let him.





""Fifteen years, Nathon. Fifteen years I thought you'd always have my back.





""But I guess I was wrong.""





Chapter 2





The past two years ever since Harper Parker showed up, everything between Nathon and me had crumbled.





Every inside joke we used to have. Every comfortable silence. Every moment where I thought we just got each other—gone.





And the thing he said most, over and over, until I could recite it in my sleep?





""Just let her have this.""





It started small.





""Harper just transferred into our class. She doesn't have many friends yet. You should cut her some slack.""





Then it escalated.





""Harper's scared to walk home alone after study hall. We're heading that way anyway—can't you just deal with the detour?""





And then it got ridiculous.





""Harper didn't understand this problem during class. She just needs to sit at your desk for one study period. Is that really something to get mad about?""





...





Every. Single. Time.





And I tried—God, I tried—to be reasonable about it.





But here's the thing:





Harper had plenty of friends. Her cheer squad practically worshipped her. I couldn't walk past them in the hallway without getting ice-cold stares and whispered comments I wasn't supposed to hear.





Her family had a driver who picked her up and dropped her off every single day. She didn't even need anyone to walk her home.





And her desk partner? She hated me. So whenever Harper decided she needed Nathon's help during study hall, she'd slide into my seat like she owned it—leaving me standing there like an idiot with nowhere to sit.





I'd end up squeezed awkwardly at my best friend's desk, trying to study while they laughed and whispered two feet away. Her perfume would still be lingering at my desk when I finally got it back.





But every time I tried to bring any of this up—calmly, rationally—Nathon made me feel like I was the one being unreasonable.





His tone would shift. From casual and dismissive, to serious and patronizing, to outright irritated.





""Alina, I'm not your personal property. You need to stop being so possessive.""





And the worst part?





After hearing it enough times, I started believing him.





Maybe I was too sensitive. Too jealous. Too selfish.





Maybe he really was just being a good class president—helping out a teammate who needed support.





Maybe the problem wasn't him.





Maybe it was me.





I started second-guessing every feeling I had. Every time my chest tightened when he laughed at one of Harper's jokes. Every time my stomach dropped when he chose to sit with her at lunch instead of me.





I told myself I was overreacting. That I needed to grow up.





But now?





Now my entire future—my dream school, the one I'd sacrificed sleep and sanity for—had been ripped away from me because of her.





Because Nathon decided her happiness mattered more than mine.





Because apparently, fifteen years of friendship meant nothing compared to keeping Harper Parker comfortable.





My throat burned. My vision blurred.





I thought about all the late nights we'd spent studying together. All the times he'd walked me home when I was scared. All the promises we'd made about sticking together no matter what.





And he'd thrown it all away.





For her.





Not even for her, really—for the idea of her. For the way she looked at him after practice. For the way she made him feel like a hero.





I wasn't worth that.





My dreams? My future? My feelings?





None of it mattered.





The realization hit me like a physical blow.





I'd been so stupid.





All this time, I thought we were best friends. I thought he cared about me the way I cared about him.





But I was just... there. Convenient. Familiar.





And the second someone more interesting came along, I became disposable.





My hands were shaking. My chest ached so badly I could barely breathe.





I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and make him see what he'd done.





But what would be the point?





He didn't think he'd done anything wrong.





He still thought I was overreacting. That I'd calm down in a few days and everything would go back to normal.





That I'd forgive him. Again.





Like I always did.





But not this time.





This time, something inside me had broken. And I didn't think it could be fixed.





I took a shaky breath, forcing myself to steady.





I didn't look at Nathon. Didn't give him the satisfaction of seeing how much this hurt.





I just turned around and walked out of the school.





Chapter 3





I couldn't stop crying the whole way home.





Fifteen years. I'd known Nathon for fifteen years.





And never ever did I think he'd lie to me for someone else.





Especially not about something that would destroy my entire future.





My phone buzzed. A string of frantic messages from my best friend, Bonnie Clark.





【What the hell? Did your boy Nathon just go official with that Miss Cheerleader??】





My heart stopped.





Before I could even process it, another message popped up.





A screenshot. From Harper's Instagram.





Posted fifteen minutes ago—right after Common App locked.





【The school I've dreamed about since I was ten... and someone who moved mountains to make sure we'd get there together. 】





The post had three pictures.





One was Harper in her cheer uniform, all glowing skin and perfect beach waves.





The other two were cropped screenshots of acceptance letters—carefully framed so you could see the NYU logo but not the full names.





Except I didn't need to see the names.





I recognized the major on one of them immediately.





It was Nathon's.





The post was dripping with that coy, look-at-us energy—the kind where she wanted everyone to know without actually saying it outright.





And the comments?





A flood of heart emojis and congratulations.





""OMG you two!! ""





""Couple goals already and you're not even there yet.""





""This is so cute I'm gonna CRY""





""You guys are gonna be THAT campus couple, I'm calling it now""





And Nathon?





He'd liked it.





Not just liked it—he'd commented too.





A single emoji. A smirking face.





Like this was all some fun little game.





Oh.





So that's how it was.





I was the joke. The punchline.





The girl who thought she mattered.





My chest caved in on itself. The pain was so sharp I had to stop walking, one hand pressed against a lamppost just to stay upright.





All this time I thought we were something.





Not dating, maybe. But something.





I thought the late-night study sessions meant something. The inside jokes. The way he'd text me first thing in the morning. The way he knew my coffee order by heart.





I thought when he said ""we,"" he meant us.





But he didn't.





He never did.





I was just... there.





A placeholder.





The backup plan.





The safe option he kept around while he waited for someone better to notice him.





And the second Harper looked his way?





I became invisible.





No—worse than invisible.





I became the obstacle.





The annoying third wheel who didn't know when to leave.





My throat burned.





My vision blurred so badly I could barely see the street in front of me.





I thought back to last night.





The way Nathon had shown up at my door, eyes bright, practically vibrating with excitement.





He grabbed my hands and held them tight, looking at me like I was the only person in the world who could help him.





""Alina, listen. I need you to do this with me. I can't do it alone.""





He said he wanted to be brave. To finally break free from his parents' suffocating expectations. That going far away—together—was the only way he'd have the guts to do it.





And I believed him.





God, I was so stupid.





I hesitated at first. Of course I did.





NYU was my dream too. I'd worked myself to exhaustion for that acceptance letter.





And staying local wasn't just convenient—it was necessary. My family couldn't afford out-of-state tuition. Staying in New York meant I could live at home, save money, maybe even help out with my little brother's expenses.





I'd never even considered leaving.





But Nathon wouldn't let it go.





He grabbed my hand tighter, his voice dropping to that soft, pleading tone that always made my defenses crumble.





""Please, Alina. I can't do this without you.""





His eyes were so intense. So desperate.





And I—like the pathetic, lovesick idiot I was—couldn't say no.





So I broke.





I gave in.





I changed my application to Miami, thinking we'd be doing this together.





Thinking it meant something.





But it didn't.





It never did.





He just needed me out of the way so Harper could have her fairy-tale moment.





And I handed it to him on a silver platter.





My knees buckled. I sank down onto the curb, phone still clutched in my shaking hand.





The truth crashed over me in waves, each one more suffocating than the last.





Fifteen years of friendship.





Fifteen years of being there for him.





And all of it—all of it—had been one-sided.





I was never his best friend.





I was his entertainment. His ego boost. The girl who'd always be there, no questions asked, no matter how badly he treated me.





And the worst part?





I'd let him.





I'd spent years running toward him, thinking someday he'd see me the way I saw him.





But he never did.





And he never would.





I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to stop the tears, but they just kept coming.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My husband (25M) and I (26F) just got married in October after being engaged for nearly a year. We’ve always been long distance and I moved to his city after our wedding. We both knew that he would be working long hours at his family business after the wedding so he can provide for us. I’m still looking for a job/transferring my career over from my old state to his. I don’t have any other friends or family, he’s technically all I have plus his family. His family is very welcoming alhamduillah.

My problem is, i’m home all day, just waiting for him to come back home so we can spend time together. I usually cook and clean for us. He goes to work around 7 am and comes home around 6 pm. He’ll come home and eat with me and right away, after he eats, he goes to turn on his PC. Granted, he’ll play two hours ish and then hang out with me the remainder of the night if he doesn’t fall asleep (he usually does).

On days when we go to his parents’ house to eat because we’re invited over, we’re there for a few hours with them then we come home and he goes straight to his PC. I try my best to not get upset, or else he’d complain that i’m “taking gaming” away from him. I wish he just had the sense to think “okay my wife is alone, i’d love to spend time with her” but he doesn’t, he’s more excited to game with his guy friends than to sit and talk to me. I even feel like he talks to them more than me. It really makes me sad, I feel lonely. I don’t have anyone but him, there’s a time zone difference too so I can’t speak to my family as much as everyone’s super busy. I never really had my own friends back home regardless, but this was always our issue, I always thought he games too much. Anyway I’m just ranting, i’m just sad. I hate that his hobby is video games, I understand it in moderation but he goes home everyday, ready to game with his friends. It’s so aggravating, I really do try to be okay with it. I cater to him, bring him coffee, snacks, etc. It gets to the point where i’m just sitting there alone, waiting for h to finish. If we were to argue about this again, he’d say something along the lines of i’m being too much or too clingy and maybe that’s why he’s not dying to hang out with me.

I’m grateful for him and what he does but it makes me sad to think he’d rather game and satisfy his happiness than try to do some couple stuff. He even just came in right now asking if I was mad, I said no just to not start an argument (i know it will) and as he was walking away I asked him “are you gonna keep gaming?(it’s been two hours at this point)” and he responded with “yeah, I thought you weren’t mad? I can’t have a night to myself?”

Sighs. I’m just asking for some friendly advice or guidance? Has anyone gone through this before?",2,1765336290.0,MuslimMarriage,4,1.0,False

1pirnlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/comments/1pirnlq/there_are_no_words/,There are no words,"I never thought I’d be in this situation.  So 4 months ago, I caught my ex cheating we have a 2 year old together. 

He got into a relationship with someone almost immediately. Introduced our daughter to her after a month. Moved in with her. Made my daughter a room at her house 2 months in and I’m just trying to manage my own grief as a stay at home mom suddenly turned into a single mom. But also learning how to co parent fairly with a person whom I was building a family with and betrayed me.

Well the new girlfriend is desperately trying her hardest to be my friend, I’ve tried telling my ex to keep things about my daughter but they have offered to co sign on a place for me, sending me housing links, offering to send me extra money, offering to help me find work.

And her, she has offered to “kidnap me” to take me for a road trip, offered to have dinner with me, keeps offering support emotionally. I offered to sit down and have coffee after I refused the dinner because it felt like too much at the time, but she kept saying “I know this awkward I know this is hard” and I was like screw it let’s have coffee and try to smooth over some things and she bailed.. 

All the while I’m just sitting here trying to manage this new life, and just thinking what the heck is this. 

I don’t know what I’m asking or needing but I’ve never been so exhausted by something and yes, I understand the importance of being civil to the new partner since my child is with her and trust me I am but holy fudge. This feels unorthodox. ",4,1765335891.0,coparenting,8,1.0,False

The boots that thunder in belong to Casey—tall, calm, paramedic badge flashing—and the second his blue eyes land on my crotch-snaps and pacifier clip, something shifts: professional concern melts into a quiet, possessive warmth I’ve never felt from a man before.



He kneels, murmurs, “I’ve got you, babygirl,” voice pitched low, and I swear the pain dims like morphine already dripped straight into my heart.



On the ride to Memorial he tucks my stuffed cat under the blanket, shields my onesie from gawking neighbors, texts later: You’re not broken—this Little thing is brave.



I text back trembling emojis; he answers with groceries, shower chair, Thai take-out, patience wrapped in Daddy energy.



Wound checks turn into couch cuddles, cartoon marathons, his hand covering mine on the satin edge of my pink blankie while he calls me good girl.



Under Mr. Whiskers watching from the headboard, I taste apple juice on his tongue.



God, I actually get a Daddy in every cloud has a silver lining.



————————



Abigail



The opening theme of Bluey plays for the third time tonight and I'm exactly where I need to be.



My apartment is dim except for the glow of the television. I'm curled up on my oversized bean bag with Mr. Whiskers tucked under one arm and my favorite pink blanket draped over my legs. The pacifier between my lips bobs gently as I watch Bluey and Bingo play their game, and something tight in my chest finally starts to unwind.



This is my space. My safe space. The place where Abigail Goodwin, CPA, doesn't have to exist for a few precious hours.



I shift and the bulk of my diaper crinkles softly beneath my onesie. It's pale purple with little stars on it, worn soft from washing, and the snaps at the crotch press gently against my skin through the padding. The sensation is grounding. Comforting. A physical reminder that right now, in this moment, I don't have to be the competent professional who spent fourteen hours today reconciling a corporate client's absolute disaster of a tax situation.



My phone sits face-down on the coffee table. Fourteen missed calls from work. Twenty-three emails that came in after I left the office. All of them can wait until tomorrow because it's nine at night in mid-April and I have officially clocked out.



Well. I've clocked out in the adult sense. Right now I'm clocked firmly into being small, and my biggest concern is whether I want apple juice or chocolate milk before bed.



On screen, Bandit is being a good daddy, playing along with his daughters' imagination game even though he's clearly exhausted. I watch with something like longing curling in my stomach. Not for a father, I had one of those and he was wonderful before the accident took him and Mom when I was nineteen. No, the longing is for something else entirely. Someone who'd understand this. Who'd see me like this and not run screaming.



I've tried dating. Regular dating. The kind where you put on real clothes and makeup and pretend you're a functional adult who has her together. It always ends the same way. Three dates, maybe four, and then I start feeling the walls close in because I can't be myself. Can't explain that sometimes I need to come home and color in a coloring book for two hours while drinking from a sippy cup. Can't admit that my bedroom has stuffies lining the shelves and a whole drawer full of onesies and pull-ups.



So I stopped trying. It's been two years since my last relationship, and honestly? This is better. Easier. No one to disappoint when they realize I'm fundamentally broken in a way that makes normal relationships impossible.



I let the pacifier fall from my mouth, letting it dangle from the clip attached to my onesie, and reach for my sippy cup. The apple juice is cold and sweet and perfect. I take three long gulps before setting it back on the coffee table, already thinking about what snack I want.



My stomach growls. Goldfish crackers, maybe. Or the fruit snacks shaped like cartoon characters that I definitely did not buy in the kids' section of the grocery store while avoiding eye contact with everyone.



The fruit snacks are on top of my refrigerator. I put them up there this morning in a fit of organization, thinking I'd grab them later when I wanted them.



I unfold myself from the bean bag, my legs a little stiff from being curled up so long. The carpet is soft under my bare feet as I pad into my small kitchen. The light above the stove casts everything in a warm glow, and I can see my reflection in the microwave. Messy bun on top of my head, pacifier dangling against my chest, onesie stretched across my hips.



I look ridiculous. I look perfect. I look like me.



The fruit snacks are just out of reach, even when I stretch on my tiptoes. Of course they are. Because I'm five-foot-three on a good day and apparently past-Abigail thought she was a giant this morning.



My desk chair is right there, the one with wheels that I usually push under my desk in the corner of the living room where I sometimes work from home. I drag it over to the fridge, not thinking much about it beyond getting my snacks and going back to my show.



The chair rolls easily across the laminate floor. Too easily, maybe, but I'm already climbing onto it, one knee on the seat, then the other foot finding purchase. I rise up, steadying myself with one hand on top of the fridge, reaching with the other.



My fingers brush the box of fruit snacks.



The chair moves.



It happens so fast. One second I'm reaching, the next the chair is rolling out from under me and I'm falling. My hip clips the counter on the way down and then there's the coffee table, the corner of it, and my leg is bending in a way that legs should not bend and then there's a sound.



A crack. Sharp and horrible and wet.



I hit the floor and the pain is immediate and blinding and wrong. So completely and utterly wrong that for a moment I can't even process what's happened. My brain is just screaming wrong wrong wrong while my body tries to curl in on itself.



I can't curl. Something is wrong with my leg. Very wrong.



I make a sound. It's high and thin and animal, nothing like my regular voice, and it echoes in my small apartment. My vision swims and I think I might throw up. I force myself to breathe through my nose, in and out, trying to get control while my nervous system does its best to make me pass out.



Don't look. Don't look at your leg. Just breathe.



I look.



My left leg is wrong. The shin is wrong. There's a bump that shouldn't be there and oh god, oh god, there's something white poking through my skin and that's bone. That's my bone. I can see my bone.



The scream that comes out of me is raw and terrified and makes my throat hurt. My hands are shaking. My whole body is shaking. The pain is like nothing I've ever felt before, radiating up from my leg in hot waves that make my teeth chatter.



I need help. I need help right now.



My phone. Where's my phone? Coffee table. I'm on the floor next to the coffee table. I twist, gasping when the movement sends fresh agony through my leg, and grab blindly until my fingers close around my phone.



Nine-one-one. I need to call nine-one-one.



But I'm wearing a onesie. I'm wearing a diaper. There's a pacifier clipped to my chest and Mr. Whiskers is three feet away, staring at me with his button eyes. My living room is full of evidence. The coloring books on the coffee table. The sippy cup. The episode of Bluey still playing on the television, Bandit's voice a cheerful backdrop to my nightmare.



I can't. I can't have strangers come here and see all of this.



Another wave of pain rolls through me and I sob, the sound ugly and desperate. My leg is broken. Badly broken. Compound fracture, some distant part of my brain supplies helpfully, the part that took anatomy in college. The bone is through the skin. This isn't something I can just walk off or wrap in an ace bandage. This is hospital-level bad.



My fingers are slick with sweat as I unlock my phone. The screen is too bright, the numbers swimming in front of my eyes. I tap nine. I tap one. I tap one again.



The ringing seems to last forever.



""Nine-one-one, what's your emergency?""



""I fell."" My voice comes out thin and shaky, small in a way that has nothing to do with how I was feeling ten minutes ago. ""My leg. I think it's broken. I can see... there's bone. I can see bone.""



""Okay, I need you to stay calm for me. What's your address?""



I rattle it off, the numbers and street name coming automatically even though my brain feels like static. The dispatcher's voice is professional and soothing and I cling to it like a lifeline while she asks me questions. Can I move? No. Am I bleeding? I don't think so. Am I alone? Yes.



Yes, I'm alone. I'm always alone. And now I'm alone and broken on my living room floor wearing a diaper and there's a box of fruit snacks somewhere near my head that I'll never be able to look at again without wanting to die.



""Paramedics are on their way. I need you to stay on the line with me, okay? Don't try to move.""



As if I could. The pain is making me light-headed now, a dizzy rushing feeling that makes the room tilt. I let my cheek rest against the cool floor and try to focus on breathing. In through my nose. Out through my mouth. Don't think about what I'm wearing. Don't think about what they're going to see.



But that's all I can think about.



My little space. My private, safe, sacred space. About to be violated by strangers who will take one look at me and know. They'll know everything. They'll see the onesie and the diaper and the pacifier and they'll know exactly what I am.



Shame burns hot in my chest, competing with the pain for dominance. This is my worst nightmare. This is every anxiety spiral I've ever had made real. I want to crawl out of my own skin. I want to wake up and have this be a terrible dream.



But it's not a dream. It's real. My leg is shattered and help is coming and there's nothing I can do to hide what I am.



""Abigail? Are you still with me?"" The dispatcher's voice cuts through my spiraling thoughts.



""Yeah. I'm here.""



""Good. The paramedics are close. Just a few more minutes. You're doing great.""



I'm not doing great. I'm the opposite of great. I'm broken and exposed and about to be humiliated in front of medical professionals who will probably put it in their group chat later. You'll never guess what we walked into tonight.



I close my eyes and try to pretend I'm somewhere else. Anywhere else. But the pain won't let me drift. It keeps me anchored to this moment, to this reality, to the sound of sirens getting closer.



The television is still going. Bluey's theme song plays again and I almost laugh except it would hurt too much. This episode will be ruined for me forever. This whole night will be ruined forever. This might ruin everything.



The sirens are loud now. Right outside. The dispatcher is saying something about them being here, about how I can hang up now, about how they'll take good care of me.



I end the call and let my phone fall from my hand.



There are voices in the hallway. Heavy footsteps. Professional, efficient sounds of people who do this every day and have seen everything.



They haven't seen this.



I grab the edge of my blanket and try to pull it over myself but it doesn't reach far enough. Doesn't cover the onesie or the obvious bulk of the diaper or any of the dozens of ways this apartment screams what I am.



There's a knock on the door. Firm and authoritative.



""Paramedics!""



My heart is beating so hard I can feel it in my throat. This is it. This is the moment where my carefully constructed walls come crashing down and there's nothing I can do to stop it.



Another knock, more insistent.



""Abigail Goodwin? Paramedics. We're coming in.""

The biggest breakthrough for me was uncoupling it from my morning coffee ritual. Once that link was broken, something shifted. I started to realize I didn’t actually want it anymore; it was just a story my mind had been telling me.

It’s wild how the brain works. For a while, that little voice kept whispering, “just one more,” as if it were doing me a favor. But once you recognize that voice for what it really is…nothing more than a chemical signal your brain is subconsciously firing …you suddenly gain this strange sense of power over it.

It’s almost like meditation: when a thought comes up, you acknowledge it without judgment and let it drift away. I’m learning to treat the craving the same way. Instead of fighting it, I watch it rise and fall like a passing cloud, and not let it alter my overall mood. And the more I do that, the more I realize there’s nothing waiting for me on the other side of that urge…no reward, no peace, just another loop.",4,1765335858.0,QuittingZyn,2,1.0,False

First off a bit of background. I’ve been roleplaying off and on for over 10 years now. I write exclusively in 3rd person, and I tend to write A LOT haha. I also  can reply several times a week. I also enjoy a decent amount of OOC chat and bonding with my writing partner.

Onto my idea! The other day I was at a 7Brew coffee (one of the drive up coffee places), and they always have a chatty college aged gal there that talks with you for a few minutes as they make your coffee. I’m a sucker for roleplay where strangers fall for each other so I wanted to combine these two ideas. Maybe it just so happens that I come the days that you work and we really start to hit it off. We can throw in days where we don’t match up too (I don’t get coffee or you arnt working). Maybe it progresses to getting your number. I just like the idea that the connection forms over a series of these smaller interactions. Maybe the conversations get more personal despite other coworkers and patrons in their car being around. Maybe there’s drama in one of our lives. There are a lot of ways we could play this out but the main elements are strangers to lovers and also focusing on building that connection in those short bursts rather than hours longs talks or dates.

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

My and my now ex (both 20) met last year at University and started formarly dating on December 26. Everything went amazing, but on August ive sensed something was off and we went for a coffee and she told me there were certain things about me she didnt like, like I wasn't paying mich attention to her, we werent seeing each other a lot (mind u we saw each other EVERY DAY AT UNI and talked and texted all the time) and i wasn't affectionate enough and that.

  
So the next MONTHS i started to do things. Bought her coffee, we went on dates, birthday parties, even went to the cinema and HAD SEX. So everything was great right?

So a week later she broke up with me because of the same things,  its as iif even thoughI tried she couldn'tsee my effort. She told me she didnt want someone with 'those qualities' in her life, but she told me she loved me and wanted to stay in,touch and with my family and all. This was October 3rd.

  
The next month I was feeling like shit. I texred her crying every 2 days and couldn't even work properly, i was honesteoy bedrotting. Later that month SHE INVITED ME to a coffee and talking and i told her i couldnt be her friend and I wanted to improve and she told me ""me too, i cant see myself not being your partner"". On november SHE INVITED ME to a show she was signing at and i went and later she toldme about how it was best for us to stop talking. I told her I wont see her again until next year and she said ""Well maybe we can see each other before December ends"".

  
I dont understand her.

  
After some pretty rough days of watching her Instagram I decided to block her. That was 2 weeks ago. I texted her telling her that and that I was gonna wait until end of January to see what we would do. She started talking A LOT about how there was nothing to talk about and her mind was made up day 1 (A LIE LOL) and even if I promise her i wont change cuz i was too late to change things. I told her ""Im gonna change for me, goodbye"" and she satarted yapping about ""yeah i know u can"". What a full of shit.

  
In the past weeks i started going to therapy, reading, meditating, adnd honestly I'm still thinking about her a lot. I dont understand cuz she says shes done but then she did all those (and many more) weird things. Some part of me still wants her back, but not as in October, idk its kinda weird now. 

  
What i get really mad about is how she couldn't see all the things i did for her and many more when she told me about them. Its like she is blind for what I did at the begging and everything else, she just cant see it. Im scared she's 100% made up cuz idk I still think we can work it out if she wasn't so closed off. She just doesnt trust me  idk.

Idk some part of me still thinls she will get around, she has to, but ifl anymore. And as I dont have any way of communicating or knowing what shes doing, lately ive been getting to the conclusion that WE ARE DONE SHE HATES ME ILL NEVER GET HER SHE FORGOT ABOUT EVERTRHING WE HAD, and idk its tiring man

I went into remission with PTU ( allergic to methimazole) in 2022 but that was short lived. I have been on PTU ever since and have been doing ok on it. Labs from August showed I was sub clinical hyperthyroid with all hormones in range other than TSH and even antibody levels have gone down. Just got my labs and ultrasound taken yesterday and everything is messed up. My TSH still is <.01 and now t3 is somewhere around 8 and T4 is around 1.9. My ultrasound showed diffuse increased heterogeneity and intense increased vascularity of the thyroid consistent with thyroiditis which I have never seen before. My endo said the results are fine and don’t need to worry. She hasn’t reviewed my most recent lab tho. I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’ve actually changed my diet to more Whole Foods, I make my lunch and bring it to work as well as dinner. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke and I have been consistent with my PTU. I also recently started going to red light sauna to help with any inflammation AND stopped drinking coffee. So why all of the sudden has it gone so bad??? :(",5,1765335432.0,gravesdisease,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

so we got coffee and the date lasted around 2 hours. at the end, he asked if I wanted to get coffee again. we got coffee the next day and the date nearly lasted 3+ hours. we both mentioned we had told our friends/families. keep in mind he's paid for everything. in-between the days we were not seeing eachother, we were texting/calling. I had an event I went to, and I sent him some photos of me dressed up in which he called me stunning.

on saturday, we finally went on our date. he came and picked me up at my place. we ended up going to lunch at a really nice place and once again, he paid. we had a good time and he took me back to mine, even helped me grab some stuff for my party later that evening. he gave me a small kiss at the end, and we continued to talk into the evening. on sunday he offered to cook dinner at his, in which I accepted and he said he would come pick me/get an uber.

we got coffee this week on Tuesday and he mentioned a holiday networking event. he asked me to be his 1+ and said we would pregame with his friends beforehand. I accepted the offer.

overall, I really like this guy. I think he is super sweet and defiantly want to know him more. I've had some really bad expiecnes in dating/men, and have never had a boyfriend. just a few questions.

1.) does it seem like he is looking for something casual? because based on the 1+ it does not seem that way.

2.) do you think he is lovebombing me? I personally do not think he is.

3.) is it too early for him to be asking me over? so far, we have gone on atleast 4 dates.

1pirfq6,https://i.redd.it/64ygm7f4ka6g1.jpeg,Asus ROG Swift PG32UCDMR has arrived,"Had an LG 38GL950-B ultrawide for more than 5 years. It is a great monitor with a single flaw that I cannot tolerate, which is the active fans inside it. Over time it had become a high-pitched whine which I am quite certain was giving me headaches, to the point I'd put headphones on my head just to drown out the noise. Couldn't deal with it any more so I had to find a passively cooled monitor. I figured that OLEDs had gotten to a point where they are safer long term investments so it was time to upgrade.

I was hoping for a larger 4K UHD OLED model with a decent bump in refresh rate, but also one with some half decent connectivity as a guy who often works from home. So the combination of 90W PD, a built-in KVM and some nice protection features for the panel itself,as well as DP 2.1, was enough to convince me to go for this model. I got an absolutely crazy good deal from a local computer parts reseller, so I think I got lucky.

Can say I'm very impressed, setup was easy as was the firmware updates. I'm a fan of uniform brightness for doing productivity work during the day and I really like the proximity sensor. Seems to do a good job of figuring out that I'm making a coffee or whatever and turns itself off.

The boots that thunder in belong to Casey—tall, calm, paramedic badge flashing—and the second his blue eyes land on my crotch-snaps and pacifier clip, something shifts: professional concern melts into a quiet, possessive warmth I’ve never felt from a man before.



He kneels, murmurs, “I’ve got you, babygirl,” voice pitched low, and I swear the pain dims like morphine already dripped straight into my heart.



On the ride to Memorial he tucks my stuffed cat under the blanket, shields my onesie from gawking neighbors, texts later: You’re not broken—this Little thing is brave.



I text back trembling emojis; he answers with groceries, shower chair, Thai take-out, patience wrapped in Daddy energy.



Wound checks turn into couch cuddles, cartoon marathons, his hand covering mine on the satin edge of my pink blankie while he calls me good girl.



Under Mr. Whiskers watching from the headboard, I taste apple juice on his tongue.



God, I actually get a Daddy in every cloud has a silver lining.



————————



Abigail



The opening theme of Bluey plays for the third time tonight and I'm exactly where I need to be.



My apartment is dim except for the glow of the television. I'm curled up on my oversized bean bag with Mr. Whiskers tucked under one arm and my favorite pink blanket draped over my legs. The pacifier between my lips bobs gently as I watch Bluey and Bingo play their game, and something tight in my chest finally starts to unwind.



This is my space. My safe space. The place where Abigail Goodwin, CPA, doesn't have to exist for a few precious hours.



I shift and the bulk of my diaper crinkles softly beneath my onesie. It's pale purple with little stars on it, worn soft from washing, and the snaps at the crotch press gently against my skin through the padding. The sensation is grounding. Comforting. A physical reminder that right now, in this moment, I don't have to be the competent professional who spent fourteen hours today reconciling a corporate client's absolute disaster of a tax situation.



My phone sits face-down on the coffee table. Fourteen missed calls from work. Twenty-three emails that came in after I left the office. All of them can wait until tomorrow because it's nine at night in mid-April and I have officially clocked out.



Well. I've clocked out in the adult sense. Right now I'm clocked firmly into being small, and my biggest concern is whether I want apple juice or chocolate milk before bed.



On screen, Bandit is being a good daddy, playing along with his daughters' imagination game even though he's clearly exhausted. I watch with something like longing curling in my stomach. Not for a father, I had one of those and he was wonderful before the accident took him and Mom when I was nineteen. No, the longing is for something else entirely. Someone who'd understand this. Who'd see me like this and not run screaming.



I've tried dating. Regular dating. The kind where you put on real clothes and makeup and pretend you're a functional adult who has her together. It always ends the same way. Three dates, maybe four, and then I start feeling the walls close in because I can't be myself. Can't explain that sometimes I need to come home and color in a coloring book for two hours while drinking from a sippy cup. Can't admit that my bedroom has stuffies lining the shelves and a whole drawer full of onesies and pull-ups.



So I stopped trying. It's been two years since my last relationship, and honestly? This is better. Easier. No one to disappoint when they realize I'm fundamentally broken in a way that makes normal relationships impossible.



I let the pacifier fall from my mouth, letting it dangle from the clip attached to my onesie, and reach for my sippy cup. The apple juice is cold and sweet and perfect. I take three long gulps before setting it back on the coffee table, already thinking about what snack I want.



My stomach growls. Goldfish crackers, maybe. Or the fruit snacks shaped like cartoon characters that I definitely did not buy in the kids' section of the grocery store while avoiding eye contact with everyone.



The fruit snacks are on top of my refrigerator. I put them up there this morning in a fit of organization, thinking I'd grab them later when I wanted them.



I unfold myself from the bean bag, my legs a little stiff from being curled up so long. The carpet is soft under my bare feet as I pad into my small kitchen. The light above the stove casts everything in a warm glow, and I can see my reflection in the microwave. Messy bun on top of my head, pacifier dangling against my chest, onesie stretched across my hips.



I look ridiculous. I look perfect. I look like me.



The fruit snacks are just out of reach, even when I stretch on my tiptoes. Of course they are. Because I'm five-foot-three on a good day and apparently past-Abigail thought she was a giant this morning.



My desk chair is right there, the one with wheels that I usually push under my desk in the corner of the living room where I sometimes work from home. I drag it over to the fridge, not thinking much about it beyond getting my snacks and going back to my show.



The chair rolls easily across the laminate floor. Too easily, maybe, but I'm already climbing onto it, one knee on the seat, then the other foot finding purchase. I rise up, steadying myself with one hand on top of the fridge, reaching with the other.



My fingers brush the box of fruit snacks.



The chair moves.



It happens so fast. One second I'm reaching, the next the chair is rolling out from under me and I'm falling. My hip clips the counter on the way down and then there's the coffee table, the corner of it, and my leg is bending in a way that legs should not bend and then there's a sound.



A crack. Sharp and horrible and wet.



I hit the floor and the pain is immediate and blinding and wrong. So completely and utterly wrong that for a moment I can't even process what's happened. My brain is just screaming wrong wrong wrong while my body tries to curl in on itself.



I can't curl. Something is wrong with my leg. Very wrong.



I make a sound. It's high and thin and animal, nothing like my regular voice, and it echoes in my small apartment. My vision swims and I think I might throw up. I force myself to breathe through my nose, in and out, trying to get control while my nervous system does its best to make me pass out.



Don't look. Don't look at your leg. Just breathe.



I look.



My left leg is wrong. The shin is wrong. There's a bump that shouldn't be there and oh god, oh god, there's something white poking through my skin and that's bone. That's my bone. I can see my bone.



The scream that comes out of me is raw and terrified and makes my throat hurt. My hands are shaking. My whole body is shaking. The pain is like nothing I've ever felt before, radiating up from my leg in hot waves that make my teeth chatter.



I need help. I need help right now.



My phone. Where's my phone? Coffee table. I'm on the floor next to the coffee table. I twist, gasping when the movement sends fresh agony through my leg, and grab blindly until my fingers close around my phone.



Nine-one-one. I need to call nine-one-one.



But I'm wearing a onesie. I'm wearing a diaper. There's a pacifier clipped to my chest and Mr. Whiskers is three feet away, staring at me with his button eyes. My living room is full of evidence. The coloring books on the coffee table. The sippy cup. The episode of Bluey still playing on the television, Bandit's voice a cheerful backdrop to my nightmare.



I can't. I can't have strangers come here and see all of this.



Another wave of pain rolls through me and I sob, the sound ugly and desperate. My leg is broken. Badly broken. Compound fracture, some distant part of my brain supplies helpfully, the part that took anatomy in college. The bone is through the skin. This isn't something I can just walk off or wrap in an ace bandage. This is hospital-level bad.



My fingers are slick with sweat as I unlock my phone. The screen is too bright, the numbers swimming in front of my eyes. I tap nine. I tap one. I tap one again.



The ringing seems to last forever.



""Nine-one-one, what's your emergency?""



""I fell."" My voice comes out thin and shaky, small in a way that has nothing to do with how I was feeling ten minutes ago. ""My leg. I think it's broken. I can see... there's bone. I can see bone.""



""Okay, I need you to stay calm for me. What's your address?""



I rattle it off, the numbers and street name coming automatically even though my brain feels like static. The dispatcher's voice is professional and soothing and I cling to it like a lifeline while she asks me questions. Can I move? No. Am I bleeding? I don't think so. Am I alone? Yes.



Yes, I'm alone. I'm always alone. And now I'm alone and broken on my living room floor wearing a diaper and there's a box of fruit snacks somewhere near my head that I'll never be able to look at again without wanting to die.



""Paramedics are on their way. I need you to stay on the line with me, okay? Don't try to move.""



As if I could. The pain is making me light-headed now, a dizzy rushing feeling that makes the room tilt. I let my cheek rest against the cool floor and try to focus on breathing. In through my nose. Out through my mouth. Don't think about what I'm wearing. Don't think about what they're going to see.



But that's all I can think about.



My little space. My private, safe, sacred space. About to be violated by strangers who will take one look at me and know. They'll know everything. They'll see the onesie and the diaper and the pacifier and they'll know exactly what I am.



Shame burns hot in my chest, competing with the pain for dominance. This is my worst nightmare. This is every anxiety spiral I've ever had made real. I want to crawl out of my own skin. I want to wake up and have this be a terrible dream.



But it's not a dream. It's real. My leg is shattered and help is coming and there's nothing I can do to hide what I am.



""Abigail? Are you still with me?"" The dispatcher's voice cuts through my spiraling thoughts.



""Yeah. I'm here.""



""Good. The paramedics are close. Just a few more minutes. You're doing great.""



I'm not doing great. I'm the opposite of great. I'm broken and exposed and about to be humiliated in front of medical professionals who will probably put it in their group chat later. You'll never guess what we walked into tonight.



I close my eyes and try to pretend I'm somewhere else. Anywhere else. But the pain won't let me drift. It keeps me anchored to this moment, to this reality, to the sound of sirens getting closer.



The television is still going. Bluey's theme song plays again and I almost laugh except it would hurt too much. This episode will be ruined for me forever. This whole night will be ruined forever. This might ruin everything.



The sirens are loud now. Right outside. The dispatcher is saying something about them being here, about how I can hang up now, about how they'll take good care of me.



I end the call and let my phone fall from my hand.



There are voices in the hallway. Heavy footsteps. Professional, efficient sounds of people who do this every day and have seen everything.



They haven't seen this.



I grab the edge of my blanket and try to pull it over myself but it doesn't reach far enough. Doesn't cover the onesie or the obvious bulk of the diaper or any of the dozens of ways this apartment screams what I am.



There's a knock on the door. Firm and authoritative.



""Paramedics!""



My heart is beating so hard I can feel it in my throat. This is it. This is the moment where my carefully constructed walls come crashing down and there's nothing I can do to stop it.



Another knock, more insistent.



""Abigail Goodwin? Paramedics. We're coming in.""



The door opens.

1pirdj7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pirdj7,Odd glitch,"Got no idea what's causing this. It's only in vault 88, and it's gradually getting worse. I'm playing with the Storywealth modpack.

As soon as I get out of those specific areas or look at it from a different direction, the problem goes away.

  
I have edited this multiple times trying to figure out how to make a dropbar/collapsable text box or whatever the hell reddit calls it for the mod order and can't figure it out.

I just literally saw him once before on gym way back 2021 when I had my vacation on my parents city and I was like dang this guy is fine and I even told myself I want him to be my bf haha after that I didn't see him again and I went back to my city. Fast forward this year early 2025 I helped my parents to move in a new village and I saw him! I was like shocked because it turns out he's our neighbor. I was like walking one time and I saw him with his friends. I feel like he looks at me and I messaged my friends haha like I'm delusional. Then later that night I was so freaking nervous and shocked because he approached me and asked my name the rest was history. However we didn't end up because his emotional traits didn't match with mine then we didn't see each other again even though we're just neighbors. Then I went back to my city since vacation is over and I manifested him for many months where his emotional characteristic matches mine but I feel like nothing happened. Then yesterday I went to the city again to get my parent's presents for me then I stopped by at coffee shop and I saw him there with his big bike! He looks at me and I stare at him back. He was about to leave the coffee shop then he went back again but that's it lol he didn't even say hi to me. ,3,1765334877.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

I would like to see Lunar New Year added back. It's celebrated internationally, not just local to a single country, and also celebrated by a large portion of the US and Canada, as well.     
Salted egg yolk could be an interesting seasonal ingredient, or red bean (adzuki bean) as a sauce base. Lantern 🏮 shaped tomato, fu (福) 🧧or chun (春) shaped pineapple, and maybe gold coin 🪙 or dumpling 🥟 shaped fish.     
Some decor could be couplings (lucky red papers put in windows) with cheese or pepperoni pizzas on them (because they are LNY colours). A round table with a lazy Susan in the middle would be cool, too. And there could be a sign in event where you get a red envelope every day with things like gems, money, a free item, 2x tips, etc. 

Another event could be Children's Day. There could be toy themed items, such as: building block counter, toy cash register, etch-a-sketch type tablet case, doll house counter item, baby bottle tip jar, clunky plastic colourful tables, and cute window stickers. 

Grandparents' Day could feature things like doilies for the tables, an accounting book in place of the register, a cookie tin tip jar, a cup of tea or coffee as counter decor, rocking chairs, repurposed sewing machine tables, etc. 

Too make room for adding more/different events and holidays, they could alternate how often new material is made for the major holidays. Christmas 2025 has new material, so to free up artist time to do LNY, Christmas 2026 could have just a re-release of previous Christmas items, plus maybe new topping skins or a log in event.

Once I got everything into my car, one of the milkshakes slightly over in the drink holder and spilled very minimally, still fine to deliver. As I turned off the lot, that same shake popped out of the holder and onto the floor. I went back to the store to have it remade and the workers were incredibly kind about it. They gave me a bunch of napkins so I could clean up my car and quickly remade it, no charge. I messaged the driver to let them know I was going back and why, then messaged them again when I was on the way. I drove very carefully there and even kept a hand on the drink holder to make sure it stayed in place.

Now before I go into the wildest part of this story, let’s talk about the packaging. I’ve delivered many of beverage-only/multi-beverage orders and have never had any issues. Most places package multi drinks and just drinks in general very well. Each shake was in the ordinary shake container, and each placed in a disposable coffee cup, and each placed inside your standard drink carrier (think BK or Taco Bell). These cups were pretty thick so didn’t fit all that securely in the carrier. On top of that, the very large hole of the milkshake lid is covered with a round sticker that doesn’t fully seal/fully make contact with the entire open circle, and then there are tabs on the side of the sticker circle that stick onto the side of the cups. Not a great design and already pretty flimsy as the worker accidentally ripped a tab as he sealed the remade drink and had to grab a new one.

Ok. Now to it. I get to the house 10 minutes after the original drop off time which I was already stressed about even though I had already informed the customer of. I double checked the orders to make sure I was delivering the shakes to the right place. As I’m doing this, one of the shakes pops out of the container and hits the floor… milkshake EVERYWHERE. Then, another one pops out and hits the floor. Then, the third one pops out and hits the passenger seat. WHATTTTT?!? I was literally mortified and so lost on what to do. Cancel the order? That would mean I’d be canceling both and didn’t want to inconvenience yet another customer. So I called the customer, explained the situation and let them know I’d still deliver since I was literally in front of their home, but that they’d want to call Door Dash to receive a refund and have a new order made. He seemed ok enough about it, I’m sure this was upsetting but he didn’t react in a bad way. I then  delivered the next order and closed out for the night. I only did 3 orders tonight but I just had to end after that. What a night🫠",2,1765334464.0,DoorDashDrivers,1,1.0,False

This is surprisingly hard to search for, as Googling ""coffee travelers"" brings up coffee recommendations for people traveling to Seattle, and different places have their own terminology. What I've found so far is:

* Obviously **Starbucks** does their 96oz travelers, both caffeinated & decaf, for $20
* **Cafe Vita** does a 96oz ""Joe To Go"" box, caffeinated only, for $50, need to order 30 minutes ahead
* **Diva Espresso** does coffee caddies, price not shown online, need to call it in 48 hours ahead

The Starbucks travelers are the most common, but I'd love to mix things up and also support local spots.

For consideration - I mainly use nunchaku variants of models for image generation, haven't messed with video at all (though may some day want to mess with it), and LLMs I generally use either my Perplexity or Gemini Pro subscriptions. So my main concern is image generation.

I currently have a 3090 build with 64gb ram and a i9-11900k. I have the ability to buy an Alienware x16 r2 laptop with a rtx 4090, core ultra 9, and 32gb ram for $1,500.

Will I take a hit in image generation or performance? (with nunchaku variants - I know with the 16gb vram I won't be able to load the larger models I can on my 3090, but even 24gb isn't enough for many models)

The main reason I am considering this - I hate being tied down to my desk. Being able to go to a coffee shop, out on my couch, or anywhere else sounds very appealing. But if there's a hit to generation times, etc, I wouldn't like that. I am here asking as ai says the Alienware would be as fast or faster than the 3090 PC I have in regards to nunchaku models...and I don't know if I believe that.

41M just moved to Burnaby near Metrotown and is looking to create a group of 5 to 7 close friends, a mix of M and Fs.

Although I'm not new to Greater Vancouver, I haven't had a sense of a friend group since I left Edmonton or Toronto years ago. You know the intimate circle of 5-7 people, where you had all-nighters working to finish that class project, or all joined the same athletic club, or a set of people to get coffee with during the breaks to talk about why the ending of Lost was \[horrible/amazing\].

I think ideally:

* East Asian group (b/c similar enough culture)
* English speaking
* 30-45 (b/c similar generation, stage of life)
* Male and Female (when else can you get the opinion from the opposite sex)
* Stylish, confident, fun (gotta find people similar to myself, am I riiiigght?)

The entire group doesn't have to do everything together. I would encourage smaller clusters (e.g., ""The gamers,"" ""The Protein Shakes,"" ""The hikers,"" ""The ones who bake,"" ""The coffee duo"") to meet 1:1 or 2:1.  This is where depth is maintained. Ultimately, it would be the monthly Dim Sum ritual that would hold us together, or a replacement group gathering for seasonal events throughout the year.

It's essential to have a platonic group of friends who are confident and value having a life outside of their relationship, so you always have a fresh story or two that your partner wasn't there for. I believe that committing to building strong bonds with new people will likely increase your longevity, be a good time for reinvention, or give you a good laugh or two.

Anyway, throwing this to the universe... DM me if interested.",0,1765333903.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,0.44,False

1piqwci,https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/1piqwci/pain_crisis_practically_bed_bound_bored_out_of_my/,Pain Crisis - practically bed bound - BORED OUT OF MY MIND.,"I slipped a disk in my back this weekend and spent about 24 hours in the ER trying to get some semblance of pain control. I have a whole basket of medication on a strict schedule, and supposedly it will start working ""eventually"". In the meantime, I'm stuck in bed. Can't sit or stand for more than 3 min without pain, and only if I've been laying down for hours before hand. My mom has to make my food and do my dishes/laundry, among other tasks that require more than 3min of standing. I'm spending an absurd amount of time lying down, as it's the only position that doesn't hurt. I have been getting up every couple hours and walking around, took a shower and made coffee today, sat in a chair while my mom cleaned out my fridge. 

I've been slowly working up to this level up pain for about a month, so I've already spent a month or so resting and staying home when I wanted to go out and taking long walks every couple days and at least short walks every day. No more walks for me now. With ""insignificant"" MRI results, I've exhausted my medical intervention quota with Kaiser. 

This is all to say... I'm fucking bored. 🥲🥹

What do you do when you're looking at a month or more of recovery? I already play video games and watch TV but God Damn™️ I am bored of that since it's what I have already been doing. I want to go outside. I can't sit in a wheelchair or walk. I knit for small bursts until my fingers hurt, I haven't tried doing my diamond art because it's hard to do laying down. Drawing and coloring is hard. Scrolling reddit/insta is toxic for my brain. Products? Accessibility tools? Fun YouTube channels? Your favorite show? Favorite indie game? 😭 I would love to hear from any people in here who have gone through this. ",22,1765333783.0,ehlersdanlos,32,1.0,False
