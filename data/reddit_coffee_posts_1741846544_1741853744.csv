I recently took some tests/quizzes and 99.9% of them point to me being a deep winter season color palette. a few shops I love tend to release things in the gorgeous earthy, neutral color tones that I think suit autumn folks quite well. I am wondering are deep winters folks able to enjoy the color brown ? Or does it have to be like a pretty dark coffee brown color? I’ve attached a brown color I am curious if it is too earthy/warm and doesn’t suit deep winter people.

Understanding Teeth Whitening Basics

Teeth whitening is more than just a cosmetic procedure – it's a process that requires careful consideration and preparation. Different methods exist, including professional in-office treatments, at-home professional kits, and over-the-counter solutions. Each approach has unique requirements and considerations that can impact your overall experience and results.

Key Factors to Consider Before Whitening

1. Dental Health Assessment
Before beginning any whitening treatment, a comprehensive dental checkup is crucial. Your dentist will:
• Examine your teeth for cavities
• Check for gum disease
• Identify any existing dental work
• Determine the most suitable whitening method for your specific needs

2. Addressing Existing Dental Conditions
Certain dental conditions can complicate teeth whitening:
• Untreated cavities
• Exposed tooth roots
• Severe tooth sensitivity
• Dental restorations like crowns or veneers

Consulting with a dental professional helps identify and address these potential issues before starting your whitening journey.

Preparing Your Teeth for Whitening

Professional Cleaning
A professional dental cleaning is an essential first step in preparing for teeth whitening. This process:
• Removes surface stains
• Eliminates plaque and tartar
• Creates a clean canvas for whitening treatments
• Helps identify any potential dental issues

Sensitivity Management
Tooth sensitivity is a common concern during whitening treatments. Preparation strategies include:
• Using sensitivity toothpaste weeks before treatment
• Taking over-the-counter pain relievers
• Avoiding extremely hot or cold foods
• Using a soft-bristled toothbrush

Dietary Modifications
In the weeks leading up to your whitening treatment:
• Reduce consumption of staining foods and drinks
• Limit coffee, tea, red wine, and dark-colored berries
• Drink water to help minimize potential staining
• Consider using a straw to reduce direct contact with teeth

• Stay hydrated
• Maintain a consistent oral care schedule

Post-Whitening Care Preparation

Preparing for post-whitening care is equally important:
• Stock up on sensitivity toothpaste
• Purchase a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Have pain relievers on hand

It is important to avoid drinking green tea on an empty stomach to prevent stomach upset and heartburn. Let’s explore the best times to drink green tea to maximize its positive effects.

# Understanding Green Tea’s Health Benefits

Green tea is renowned for its numerous health benefits, including weight loss, improved heart health, and reduced risk of certain diseases. It offers many health benefits, supported by extensive research on its positive effects on various conditions. Additionally, green tea consumption has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. Drinking tea too close to meal times can negatively impact iron absorption due to the presence of tannins.

The brew packs powerful antioxidants, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which fights free radicals and combats inflammation.

Green tea contains compounds called catechins, which are natural antioxidants that help prevent cell damage and exhibit positive vascular protective effects. Specifically, green tea catechins have been shown to aid in weight loss, preventing inflammation, and skin health.

Green tea is rich in antioxidants such as catechins and vitamin C, which help fight free radicals, slow down skin aging, and keep the skin firm and elastic.

# Factors Affecting Green Tea’s Health Benefits

The type of green tea, brewing method, and additives can all affect the bioavailability of antioxidants. Additionally, the timing of when you drink tea is crucial to maximize its health benefits, such as enhancing energy levels in the morning or promoting relaxation in the evening.

Individuals with chronic conditions, such as heart disease and high blood pressure, should consult a healthcare provider regarding green tea consumption.

Consuming green tea with vitamin C can enhance antioxidant absorption.

Research suggests that proteins, fiber, and certain minerals may impair the bioavailability of flavonoids.

# [Best Time to Drink Green Tea](https://dofotea.com/blogs/news/the-best-time-to-drink-green-tea-for-optimal-health-benefits)

1. **Morning Boost** Morning drinking green tea, preferably after breakfast, is a great way to kickstart your day. It contains beneficial catechins and antioxidants that are best absorbed on an empty stomach, enhancing focus and alertness without the jitters caused by coffee. However, it is important to avoid drinking green tea on an empty stomach as it may increase stomach acidity and cause stomach upset. It is better to drink the tea after consuming a small amount of food.
2. **Between Meals** The best time to drink green tea is between meals — around two hours before or after eating. This timing helps maximize the absorption of nutrients and antioxidants, especially if you’re consuming foods rich in iron or calcium, as green tea can sometimes inhibit their absorption. Drinking tea too close to meal times can negatively impact iron absorption due to the presence of tannins in tea. Drinking tea between meals also aids digestion and supports weight loss.
3. **Pre-Workout Energy Boost** Consuming green tea 30–60 minutes before a workout can enhance fat burning and boost endurance. Its natural compounds, like catechins and caffeine, help stimulate metabolism and increase energy levels.
4. **Afternoon Pick-Me-Up** If you experience an afternoon slump, drinking tea can provide a gentle lift. It can help you stay productive and focused without disrupting your sleep schedule, as the caffeine content is lower than coffee.
5. **Avoid Late Evenings** While green tea offers numerous benefits, it’s best to avoid drinking it late at night. The caffeine content, though moderate, can interfere with your sleep, so aim to enjoy your last cup at least 4–5 hours before bedtime.



# Conclusion

The best times to drink green tea are in the morning after breakfast, between meals, and before a workout. It’s a wonderful way to boost your energy, metabolism, and focus throughout the day. Just remember to avoid drinking it on an empty stomach or too close to bedtime. With mindful timing, you can fully enjoy the health benefits of green tea. Additionally, avoid drinking green tea on an empty stomach to prevent stomach upset and heartburn.

# Maximizing Green Tea’s Health Benefits

* Brewing tea in boiling water and letting it steep for several minutes can boost antioxidant absorption.
* Consuming tea with vitamin C can also enhance antioxidant absorption.
* Enjoying tea at the right time, such as in the morning, can also maximize antioxidant absorption.
* Drinking green tea extract or green tea extracts can provide a concentrated dose of antioxidants.
* Opting for herbal tea, such as chamomile or rosemary, as a caffeine-free option for bedtime can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality while avoiding the negative effects of caffeine.

# How much green tea can you drink in a day

The ideal amount of green tea to drink each day depends on your health and sensitivity to caffeine, but generally, it’s recommended to drink 2 to 3 cups per day. Here’s a breakdown of what you should keep in mind:

2 to 3 cups a day (about 400–600 ml) is considered safe for most people and provides enough antioxidants, like catechins, to boost metabolism, improve brain function, and support overall health.

Drinking up to 4 cups can be fine if you have a high caffeine tolerance, but going beyond that may cause side effects. Can cause insomnia, headaches, or increased heart rate.



# Tips for a Healthy Green Tea Routine

Try our organic [**green tea**](https://dofotea.com/collections/green-tea) and brew a cup of green tea yourself, which is healthy and environmentally friendly.

Place cool, slightly damp green tea bags on your eyes for 15-20 minutes to reduce swelling and relax.

Drink green tea in moderation and consult with a healthcare provider if you have any health concerns.

**My Background** 

I’m a social scientist in my late 40’s who converted a love of computers and data along with my passion for research and predicting the future into a job in tech. I accidentally became a data scientist before that job title really existed. Fun times.  I worked for both large and small companies, both as an FTE and a private consultant. In between jobs in the Fall of 2013 I fell deep into the Bitcoin rabbit hole. I bought on and off for a few years (best price: $220, highest price: $965.) I sold a majority of my holdings in December 2017 when it hit $15k (and the BCH fork hit $3500) for about 1.5M. I had also saved a ton of money over the years (almost 1M) because I lived frugally. My job was no longer very interesting so I quit to take a 1 yr sabbatical/test run and never looked back. I also sold my house three years ago for a large profit. I have a partner who is not exactly FI/RE, and no kids.

**My FIRE Details**

With all my retirement, bank, and stock accounts bundled together, including house equity I had 4M when I pulled the trigger. Since retirement 7 years ago my entire portfolio has more than tripled to 12M at the peak (December 2024). It hasn’t been a linear journey though, it dropped from 9M at one point to just below 5M (December 2022) but is now 11.3M. I outright own my house and truck. I have no debts. 
My portfolio consists of index funds (surprise!) and a few tech stocks I invested $10k each in several years ago as “YOLO” plays (AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA) as well as my remaining Bitcoin not sold in 2017. My retirement funds are at 515k, so a majority of my wealth is outside of the IRAs. My lifestyle is currently funded by two sources: a deferred salary from my old job (finishes payouts this year) and dividends from my index funds. So far I have rarely needed to cash out stocks for income but that might change due to deferred salary payouts ending. 
I spent $80k last year. Insurances and Taxes account for a lot of that spending ($27k), $15k to my niece’s education fund, $12k on house improvements (including building a sauna), $4k for utilities. I look at my portfolio once a month when I do my net worth tracking (custom Excel spreadsheet). Otherwise, I don’t pay much attention to it all. 


My net worth swings wildly. See the post (referenced above) on the first time I lost a million dollars in a month… because it’s actually happened 4 times. I also gained over 1M a month 4x in the last several years. My average monthly change in net worth since retiring is $93,500 (which is stupid and insane.) The standard deviation of that monthly change gives you an idea of the volatility… $513,000. Sounds like a rollercoaster, doesn’t it? It is – but I got used to it, especially because over the long haul the amount has, if you cross your eyes a little, steadily increased. If I really couldn’t take it I’d just shove everything into tax-free municipal bonds or something. 

**Big Changes**

In the last year my major changes were around organizing my finances. No big trips, some house fixing (mostly me doing the work), and no major surprises or large outlays for unusual situations. 
I had a fundamental shift in how I thought about my wealth. As I moved past the 10M net worth waypost, it struck me that I was at a place where I could suffer a huge pullback and still be able to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I also realized it was not very useful to hold onto all of my wealth until I died if I was planning on giving it to family anyway. In other words, it seemed absurd to hang on to all of it only to give it to my siblings as inheritance if I lived to be, say, 85 years old and they were also in their 80’s… sure they could hand it down to their families or charities etc. but it makes more sense to me to allow them to have the opportunity to use some of that capital sooner. I also feel like I can and should give money to charity. I feel safe enough to do so without worry. I grew up without much, so the idea of fearlessly giving away my money took a while to manifest. I wasn’t comfortable with the idea until last year. So now I have a goal – I want to give at least 1M to charity. I want to do the same for my siblings sooner vs. later, but I don’t quite know how I’ll do that yet. My siblings are awesome people, and they would never expect me to give them money, nor would they ever feel like they “deserved” my money. None of those “never tell your family you have money or they will come after it” horror stories apply to my family, and I am very grateful for that. I gave them each a generous surprise cash gift last year (not represented in my statement of spending above) and I will probably do the same this year, and possibly into the future depending on how volatile the markets (traditional and bitcoin) get. 

I started a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) and funded it by donating my TSLA stock (because fuck Elon) that was worth around $70k (not bad for a $10k investment 12(?) years ago that I also took $50k from a few years back…) The DAF allows me to donate however much I want to whomever I want (501c3) while also being invested in the market. I have made 4 smaller donations ($500-$1500)so far and it’s really cool to be able to support my community this way. I also got a tax write-off for a portion of it and was not on the hook for any cap gains at all. Wins all around, and 7% of my 1M-to-charity goal funded! 


I moved some money into a Direct Indexing account in order to take advantage of loss harvesting (and I think the timing was right based on what we have seen in the markets over the last month). I feel like I am tuning up my financial position now that I understand it better and have some plans about wealth preservation and sharing. 


I switched my will to a revocable trust, because I needed to update it anyway and it made sense with what I currently own to keep as much out of probate as possible if I were to die so that everyone gets paid out with no bullshit. I also got my powers of attorney set up and all that other fun health directive stuff. I feel very adult at this point. 

**New Ideas/Directions** 

I feel like I am in a good rhythm. I want to do one decent trip a year (3 weeks?), focus on my various forms of art, my community, learning, and improving my house and neighborhood. I have pondered living somewhere else for a full season (Maine? NYC? Berlin?) at some point,  perhaps by house swapping with someone. I’m mostly content where I am (physically, mentally, etc.) There is really nothing material that I am interesting in acquiring outside of some tools (for art), books, etc. – basically nothing particularly expensive or exotic. No vacation houses (too much work!) No fancy cars (I rarely drive anyway.) None of that nonsense is useful to me at this point. As an example, I think my clothing outlay last year was around $200. It has nothing to do with “not wanting to spend money” – if you took me to a clothing store and said “take whatever you want!” I would look for the blue jeans and pick up 10 pairs of the exact same color and then I’d get 30 black t-shirts and call it a day. For real.  

**Challenges**

If you review my previous posts you’ll see that my one stubborn challenge has always my weight – not that I am particularly big (I’m not) but that extra 15 lbs man… it’s still real, it’s still here (and it’s still only 15 lbs – honest!) and I’m not quite ready to say “you know, this is just who you are and this will not change” – I have some strategies in mind so I’ll leave it there. But there’s actually something bigger, something beyond that old complaint. 

In the last couple years I am actually starting to feel older. I am recognizing I will never be as fast as I once was. There are small things I can no longer do (or would need a lot of training to get back to where I could) like jumping off of a huge rock without repercussions.  I have always been really healthy, rarely sick, reasonably strong and limber (without trying) and I see it and moreover *I feel it* now that I am aging that I am not the man I once was. It’s in there…slowing me down slightly but noticeably, and it’s weird. The challenge is twofold – recognizing the truth, and being okay with the body that I inhabit. I can still do all the things I want to, but my knees are creaky when I wake up, and sometimes my back hurts a little for no good reason. Boo fucking hoo, right? But it’s real, and I’d be lying if I acted like it didn’t matter. The last year has really been a study in what is vs. what was.

**Closing**

Like I mentioned last year, I’m at this point where I’m enjoying a sincerely low-key existence. I’m that guy who hangs out in his garage, tinkering on things, fixing stuff that most people would throw away, making weird art to stick around the neighborhood. There’s a local bar that I visit every week or two, and they know me there. They know my name, my drink, my habits. I’ve never had that kind of connection before, and it feels good. It feels right. It feels real. I still love to travel, both with my partner and by myself. I have my shop, my gardens, friends, things to pursue and learn. One of my favorite things to do is wake up when I wake up, make coffee, and sit in the living room or on the front porch, reading news and doing word puzzles. That’s my preferred pace. Moreover – that’s what FI/RE has allowed me to do – my own thing in my own time (nods to Fonda/Hopper). 
Also – I’ve been out of the game so long I can’t even imagine rejoining it. Yes, of course I could, but it feels like a different lifetime ago, or something I read about.

1ja6lod,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ja6lod/dream_demon_that_haunts_my_life/,Dream demon that haunts my life,"Back when I was younger I used to have these dreams about this black panther. At first, it seemed like nothing out of the ordinary for the mind of a six year old. Until one day, maybe the second or third time I dreamt about him it became hostile. My imaginary “friend” would taunt me and sit on my chest, calling out to me frequently.

 I would be peacefully sleeping and wake up with the sudden feeling of dread and get knocked back down again upon hearing “ I see you “ be hissed at me across my room. At this point, I had named this “ friend “ isee, due to his terrifying call. It was specifically this house I had just moved into that he began to terrorize me. Before hand I had lived in a townhouse owned by my uncle who had just kicked my family out. ( there were other very strange paranormal things happening in that house ) 

After being kicked out, my parents found this lovely townhouse in this community with kids around my age and my brothers age. My brothers back then were around three or four years old well I was around six. They slept in the room beside mine and never really complained about much scary activity through out the night but they really hated the basement in that house.

 Going onto the basement, it was a decent well kept modern basement with enough room for a couch, tv, coffee table and plenty other things. There was this cellar right by the bathroom which both rooms were never used at all, due to the feeling of dread my family felt. I later found out the cause of the rooms being empty beside random things in the cellar was due to
to the fact no one wanted anything to do with them, we didn’t even keep hand soap or anything in the basement bathroom ; especially anything in the cellar. 

That was the main paranormal issue in the house for my entire family, no one ever had night terrors like myself. For whatever reason, and it was most likely because I grew up in Midwest Canada there was always scary shit happening. However, this “friend” was the scariest I had experienced at this point in my life. 

Before I continue on, I’m going to point out that I’m now 21 and live on the other side of the country yet this thing still haunts me. The only reason I’m writing this right now is because I was telling my fiancé about my nightmares and he encouraged me to post here to see if anyone has any answers or similar experiences. 

Alright, enough useless background info and straight to the point : I was being taunted every time I did anything slightly wrong. That’s when he would appear, calling out to me telling me “ I see you”. Even if it was a slight mess up, like getting a B on a test or dropping something and breaking it ; he was there. It progressed from a semi regular nightmare to a regular one. It kept getting more energy-sucking as well. I remember “ waking up “ from these nightmares and feeling more tired than I was going to sleep. 

It peaked one night where I woke up before he even said anything, I felt this feeling of dread and realized what was going to happen. So, I bolted from my bed and began to run to my parents room trying to scream for them but nothing came out. Next thing I knew, I was back in my bed with it sitting on top of me once again. I couldn’t escape him, it didn’t matter what I did. It began to effect my day to day life as I was becoming terrified of doing anything wrong in the slightest, always second guessing my actions. 

This shit continued for months until one night. I wasn’t woken this time, but I still felt the feeling of dread that isee would bring with him. This time around, it was a dream of him and I walking by this playground well the sun was setting. I remember it vividly; it was the park of the townhouse complex I had lived in before well the sky was a warm pink and yellow colour. There were hardly any cars and everything besides our conversation seemed muffled. 

I remember him being gentle, apologizing to me for everything he did and explaining to me that he had to do it ; that it was his job. He told me this would be the last time I saw him, that he had to move on to another child and that he’d miss me. At our final goodbye ending with a hug, I woke up in a sweat. A sense of relief fell upon me though and I quickly went back to bed. This was the last time I ever heard from him. I’m not too sure what the hell that was, or why it ended so peacefully. 

You may be a sceptic and blame it on some form of sleep paralysis or something but this definitely wasn’t. One of my brothers used to have sleep paralysis and when I told him about this once we got older and he explained to me what he dealt with, we both knew what isee was, was not sleep paralysis or anything of the sort. I still remember his raspy voice and the pressure he’d put on my chest. This dark, faceless figure with two ears and a tail still haunt me to this day. I don’t think I’ll ever forget what happened to me. ",2,1741851188.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False
1ja6k2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Careless-Jeweler-246/comments/1ja6k2g/tips_for_digital_marketing_2025/,Tips for Digital Marketing 2025,"Welcome to the future! [Digital](https://iiedm.com/) marketing is evolving faster than ever, and as we step into 2025, it’s time to gear up for new trends, tools, and strategies. Whether you're a seasoned marketer or just getting started, staying ahead of the curve is key to making an impact in this fast-paced digital world. Here are some tips to help you crush your marketing game in 2025.





**1. Embrace AI Like Your Life Depends on It (Because It Kind of Does!)**

AI is no longer just a buzzword—it’s the backbone of [Digital](https://iiedm.com/) marketing in 2025. From chatbots that handle customer inquiries to AI-driven content creation tools, automation is everywhere. Use AI to personalize your email campaigns, predict customer behavior, and optimize ad targeting. The more you lean into AI, the more time (and money) you'll save





**2. Prioritize Video Content (Yes, Still!)**

Video continues to dominate the [Digital](https://iiedm.com/) landscape. Short-form videos, live streams, and interactive reels are where it’s at. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts are still ruling the game, but don’t forget about emerging platforms that cater to niche audiences.



 **3. Invest in Voice Search Optimization**

With the rise of smart speakers and voice assistants, more people are searching online using their voices. By 2025, this trend is only growing stronger. Optimize your content for conversational queries and long-tail keywords to capture this audience.



**4. Get Serious About Sustainability**

Consumers in 2025 care deeply about sustainability and social responsibility. Your audience wants to know that your brand stands for something meaningful. Incorporate eco-friendly practices into your marketing strategy and be transparent about your efforts.



**5. Leverage Micro-Influencers**

Gone are the days when only mega influencers ruled the roost. Micro-influencers (those with smaller but highly engaged audiences) are where it’s at in 2025. They’re more relatable and often have stronger connections with their followers.



**6. Focus on Community Building**

In a world where algorithms are constantly changing, building a loyal community is your secret weapon. Create spaces where your audience feels seen and valued—whether it’s through Facebook Groups, Discord servers, or exclusive email lists.



**7. Experiment with Immersive Tech**

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are no longer futuristic concepts—they’re here, and they’re changing how brands interact with consumers. From virtual try-ons to immersive brand experiences, the possibilities are endless.



**8. Don’t Sleep on Data Privacy**

Data privacy is a hot topic, and by 2025, consumers expect brands to take it seriously. Be transparent about how you collect and use data, and make sure you’re compliant with the latest regulations.





**9. Keep an Eye on Emerging Markets**

The [Digital](https://iiedm.com/) landscape is expanding beyond traditional markets. Countries in Africa, Asia, and South America are seeing massive growth in internet adoption and e-commerce. Tapping into these markets could unlock huge opportunities for your brand.





**10. Stay Flexible and Curious**

If there’s one constant in [Digital](https://iiedm.com/) marketing, it’s change. The tools you’re using today might be obsolete by next year (remember Vine?). Stay curious, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to experiment with new ideas.





**Final Thoughts**

[Digital](https://iiedm.com/) marketing in 2025 is all about adaptability, creativity, and authenticity. The tools might change, but the goal remains the same: connecting with your audience in meaningful ways. So grab your coffee (or tea), fire up those analytics dashboards, and get ready to crush it this year!

I'm also considering moving back to Philly, now that I'm an adult with remote work and I could sort of pick my neighborhood instead of living in the family home. So part of this trip was looking at neighborhoods with an appraising eye. I think after this trip- if I lived in the city I'd llike the huge rectangle defined by like- Second to Broad, Ellsworth to Walnut. And if I lived in a suburb along the regional rail, maybe I'd like Elkins Park? I drove around there some and the architecture was cool.

(Also note that in this food accounting, sometimes you'll see just one meal a day, and that isn't accurate. I'm a bottomless lagoon full of food. But sometimes my family would take me to some national chain or I'd order nostalgic east coast Americanized-Chinese food.)

Food!

2/26

Dutch Eating Place: cream chipped beef over toast, scrapple (I think I was a little let down by CCB; I had really strong, positive memories but in fact it was a little bland and lumpy and reminded me of poorly seasoned southern biscuits and gravy. But- scrapple rules. The crisp exterior, the almost mousse'y interior. Hell yeah, scrapple. I'd eat you regularly.)

2/27

K'far: Jerusalem bagel with labneh trio, sour cherry turnover

Suraya: hummus, fatteh, branzino (people here were right- the fatteh is incredible.)

2/28

Tabachoy: starter sampler, sisig, adobo, kare kare (super good. I've never really eaten Filipino food, and the combination of the super rich, fatty meats and all the vinegar was fantastic.)

3/1

Middle Child: Herschel sandwich (the sandwich was nice, but ok let me hit you with an etiquette question. It's extremely busy, it takes a bit to get your food- and then almost everyone is getting breakfast sandwiches, which are quick eating. I saw some people with coffee, but most people were eating and leaving. So, I was certain you'd walk in, order, and then when you got your food you'd look for a place to sit. But instead I saw a bunch of people enter and beeline for an empty seat, claim it with a bag or jacket, and then go wait in line to order. So they'd hold a seat for a good 20 minutes in a place with like 25 seats whose main menu item takes 4 minutes to eat. IDK- is this the local high-volume place etiquette, or were these people shitheads?)

Han Dynasty: dan dan noodles, three cup chicken (theirs is my favorite dan dan noodles I've ever found. I think maybe because they use more sesame paste? But I have to say- the Old City location has far less charm than the old location across the street.)

High Street Bakery: pumpkin seed shortbread, sour cherry jam scone

3/2

Cafe Walnut: bulgogi egg and cheese on everything bagel

3/3

Dodo Bakery: egg tart, pork bun, char siu puffs

Cacia's: pizzazz slice

Pop's: cherry water ice

3/5

Angelo's: cheesesteak with fried onions and Cooper Sharp (it is as good as everyone says, imo. Maybe now that other places are doing the darker breads and all the seeds it'll be a big pack at the top. But the amount of meat and cheese, the seasoning level, the bread- for me it's perfect.)

Isgro Pastries: ricotta cannoli, mascarpone cannoli, ricotta cookies

Mawn: soft shell head on shrimp, crispy chicken skins, beef skewers, khao soi (this place is fantastic. Also pleasingly affordable, insofar as several of the starters are under 10 bux so you can try a bunch.)

3/6

Majdal Bakery: chocolate-cherry-hazelnut babka muffin, mixed nut baklava

Federal Donuts: vanilla bean sprinkle donut

Woodrow's: cheesesteak with truffle wiz and cherry pepper mayo

Milk Jawn: lemon curd with blueberry basil swirl

3/7

South Philly Barbacoa: lamb barbacoa tacos, consommé

Barbuzzo: duck breast with cherry and pureed celery, salted caramel budino (y'all were right about the budino. One of the best desserts I've ever had.)

3/9

Machine Shop: chocolate cake, chausson aux pomme, pistachio grapefuit tart slice

Sky Cafe: nasi goreng special, crab meat egg noodle soup (this place was really great. Previously I'd only had Hardena, so I was pleased to end up 2/2 great experiences with Indonesian food in Philly.)

3/10

Hilltown Tavern Fairmount: Hilltown burger, mozzarella sticks, honey Caribbean wings

3/11

EMei: dan dan noodles, chongqing chicken

3/12

Center City Pretzel Co: pretzels?? (so good. I ate a few Wawa pretzels on my trip, saving this for the end and boy does it stand out. During my last visit I think they were closed due to fire? So glad I got some)

Chickie's and Pete's (airport location): crab fries, chicken caesar wrap

\---

Also, before I forget: Lincoln Drive is fucking insane. The speed limit is 25mph, the road winds a bunch, the lanes are narrow, and I was trying to follow the flow of traffic but getting passed by lots of people doing 50+. Terrifying.

I spent most of my childhood and teen years in not-great neighborhoods of Philly. Lots of my memories were mixed. But I was really pleased exploring the city a bunch again as an adult. It's diverse, which I value a lot from the very white bread city where I live. It's got good transit (for America). It's queer friendly. It's an easy Friday night trip to a few major American cities (where I live now is a 10h drive from anything). And it pulls all this off while being more affordable than most big American cities. It's definitely at the top of my list, now, for relocation. ",7,1741850650.0,PhiladelphiaEats,1,1.0,False

1ja6fqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/1ja6fqv/multiple_problems_with_new_pc_assembly/,Multiple problems with new PC assembly,"I had a 2009 model HP Elite 7000 with 750 i5 Processor and 8 Gb ram, which was too slow by today's standard, especially for photo editing, so I decided to upgrade to a new A21 ASUS case, MSI Mortar B550m Mobo, AMD Ryzen 5 5600, Samsung 970 evo NVMe 1 Tb and 36 Gb ( XPG AX4U320016G16A-DTBKD35 GAMMIX D35 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4-3200MHz CL16 1.35V). I kept my Asus tuff 55W PSU and NVidia K620 from the HP.

First problem came using the 500 Gb Samsung SSD boot drive from the old HP. Many problems trying to get the new PC running so reverted to a fresh Win 10 Pro installation onto the NVMe without a great deal of success. After installing windows I went through the whole updating exercise of Windows and drivers.

Major problem was BSOD - Blue, black and grey (screen backlit but nothing otherwise). Finally have this in the past (I hope!) by reverting to the old NVidia drivers I was using on the HP. Since then no more BSODS and minidumps.

Second problem was that clicking on the taskbar or Windows 'start' button would result in the screen image disappearing for a few seconds before 'reviving' or just staying blank. A web search suggested deactivating/removing items from the Quick Access area of File Explorer. I had temporarily attached external HDDs to the PC and Explorer was adding these to 'Quick Access' although they were no longer attached. I presume Explorer was still trying to locate these HDDS causing it to crash. Removed the references/links and the problem went away. (Have added this in case anyone else has a similar problem.)

Lastly, if I leave the PC unattended it goes into sleep mode (as set) and then turns off the HDD. From sleep mode, the PC comes back to life quickly but after the PC has 'powered down' when the HDD turns off, if I press the space bar the logon screen appears. If I logon and then go away (like to make a cup of coffee) for a few minutes, the screen again goes blank and I have to press ''reset' to revive it. The PC is running (fans etc and USB ports) but the screen is off.

If I continue to use the PC directly after logon then the problem above doesn't happen.

I have 2 screens attacked to the K620 and they both behave similarly hence I doubt the problem is cables or monitors.

I double/treble checked the compatibility of all components on the MSI Mortar site.

The A21 came with 4 fans installed. The Mortar only has 3 fan sockets so I'm using the pump socket for the fourth fan (?). The CPU came with an AMD air cooler and the fan is connected to CPU fan mobo connection.

Temperatures of all components are 42°C max, most around 35°C as checked with HWiNFO64

Anyone have any suggestions on the third item of resuming from HDD power down above?

First off: I’m relatively new to brewing pour over coffee. 
I’ve been drinking some really good pour over coffees in on my trip to Japan and that made me want to be able to brew them at home. The color of the coffee in the cup was really light, I would even say just a tad darker than black tea. And it even tasted tea like and floral.
I’ve looked up some tutorials and recipes on YouTube and found some that made similar light coffee, but I couldn’t replicate it. Does it have to do with using too dark roasted coffee and should I use coffee that’s roasted lighter than medium to dark? ",2,1741849849.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

said she didn’t know,  
didn’t go here, never would.

while showing the person in front of me   
a dress she’s been working on   
with a veil she can slip her fingers through   
to hold up her hands and make wings. 

On the weekends I pick up shifts   
at the high school summer job   
I've already had two years too many.    
I see myself trip into twenty, thirty,    
standing behind the same cash register   
in the same uniform I couldn't stand at sixteen.   
Same goals, so much less time. 

I don’t think I’d smile for an eighteen year old   
with no clue where she’s headed either.

1ja66qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1ja66qi/regarding_inability_to_bulk/,Regarding inability to Bulk.,"Started gym in 2021 when I was 21, (183cm/6Ft height) january, my weight increased from 50 to 70 in starting 4 months alongwith huge tummy fat and jaw fat. So, even at 70 I look very skinny. Now I've been trying to gain weight since then (goal is 90 or untill I stop looking skinny). But couldn't gain, in last 3-4 years, I've been consistent except 2024 summer for 3 months break.
I used to go with a Professional trainer (he used to live in my neighbourhood back then). He told me that to bulk, I need to increase carbs and fats (protein doesn't matter for bulking). My weight mentainence calory was around 2500-2600. which I increased to 3000, then to 3500 and then to 4000 calories for 4/5 months along with progressive compound lifts, couldn't see any result,  he told me to start cheat bulk, so I eat anything/everything that I could lay my hands on. Still no result, my weight was almost constant 70-72. Not seeing any result, I stopped giving fuck about diet, and now I just eat till the moment I eat.

*In between, I started developing NAUSEA FEELING while eating certain things and during forcefeeding and I ALWAYS VOMIT ALMOST ON 80% LEGS DAYS*. He suggested and I tried on leg  days to come empty stomach/with glucose/salt/coffee and nothing worked, still vomiting couldn't stop.

Now that trainer friend is gone to other city. I told about the condition in paragraph in asterisk to my present gym trainer, he told me to go see a gastroenterologist. So i did, but the gastro couldn't find any proper reason and gave me some medicines. 

Present situation: 73 weight, huge tummy fat and jaw fat, still look skinny and legs way to skinny ( despite hitting legs twice a week for almost 2 years along with vomiting afterwards).
Now, I cant push myself on legs day due to vomiting situation, can't eat too much due to nauseating feeling.

I'm Not rich enough to afford protein, but I did managed to eat 5 whole eggs and 1kg chicken a month during 2021 and 2022.
But I can't afford proteins anymore, my financial situation has degraded since 2021.

1ja61b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ja61b7/cafébookstore/,Café/Bookstore,"Hi folks! Long story short, I was recently laid off and have hated corporate ever since I started out of college. I never saw myself working in an office anyway and I'm looking at this layoff re-evaluating life. If i'm going to be miserable, why not be miserable working for myself? 😅 

My parents are close to retiring and looking for their next thing and since I was a kid, we've always wanted to open a coffee shop. Insert me, I've always seen it more as a café & bookstore type of situation. I looked into the whole coffee shop thing right after college and saw a lot of what I see now, just selling coffee & baked goods is rarely ever enough.

Fast forward 6 years and i'm now an author, with great connections in the industry (but still working full time, another not that profitable career), and wanted to merge the things I love into one. 

My idea is this: 
A café & bookstore that focuses on community and marginalized voices. The café would have the standard things: coffee, baked goods (done by me, i bake and do it well), some soups & pasta, and basic sandwiches. I'm pretty great at cooking and most of the things I cook have multi-use ingredients that would be able to cover most, if not all dishes planned. We are heavily considering a liquor license for beer & wine to add to the menu as well. 

The book portion would obviously have the standard best sellers that draw people in, but through my connections I have well known ""tiktok famous"" author friends who I've already spoken to about having signed editions available for the shop and hosting launch parties and other events for local authors & book clubs. In addition to this, my husband would also host quarterly networking events and such to help bring in crowds & expose us to new customers. My mother is a realtor and would be doing the same for quarterly events at the location. We would also have board games available and live music nights. I understand book selling from the author side of things and marketing from the author perspective but not the book seller perspective. There are a few bookshops that carry my books that I could discuss more on the details for, but only one that i have a personal connection with is brick and mortar so unsure how sound the advice would be. 

We would also be selling merch, both author/book related, and for the shop specifically (mugs, and other local business products). 

As far as location, I'm in Atlanta in an area where there aware several local coffee shops (1-2 per exit), all of which appear to do well enough that they have *all* now expanded, and the book scene here is pretty strong. There is a building down the street from me with a vacancy next to businesses i frequent so in my 6 years here, two businesses held the lease; one in which i'd like to chat with the previous owner as they moved a few blocks over, presumably to a larger space. And the second only made it a year before shutting down; for which I think was due to customer service. The food was good but the owner & staff were extremely rude and opened/closer whenever they felt like it. So in what could be considered an over saturated area, each of these places tend to stay packed, some with long lines that end up out the door, so I'm thinking the market is here and could even take another but I'm not glued to this neighborhood entirely, and Decatur has a less saturated scene that has potential but is more costly surprisingly. 

My husband makes enough money for us to both get by and we don't have kids and aren't planning to for a few years, so I plan on  doing a lot of the heavy lifting as far as running the book counter & being the onsite manager. That portion would be split with my parents in order for me to have at least 2 days off. Other than that, we plan to hire staff. 2 full time, 2 part time. I would be prepping baked goods, soups, and pasta sauce on days we are closed so staff only has to move from fridge to pan to oven. Sandwiches and other stuff would have materials prepped before opening but obviously would need to be made as ordered though some of that would be available for pre-mades as well. 

I want to do a lot of prep up front and don't plan on just diving right into this head first. Especially with the economy at the moment, I'm assuming it's not a great time to just open up shop so it would be some time before opening though I would like to start applying for grants or exploring financing options well in advance. 

I'm not sure what else to include but I wanted to hear others opinions on this. Are we thinking of doing too much, is it not enough? Am I still stuck in dreamer mode but with dedication I can make this into something? I was a project manager prior to being laid off and I'm very familiar and used to wearing many many hats at once and managing budgets and schedules. I was a server and bar tender all through college so I do have food & beverage experience but not coffee shop though I do plan on taking barista courses and really learning the trade.

She is planning to move to my country (we live 2000km apart) as soon as possible, and is looking for job opportunities. The relationship is generally nice, everything is fine considering that we dont see each other too often.

Last saturday we had planned to watch a movie together remotely. We had no time set, and I completely forgot about it. She tried to message and call me but my phone was muted, and I was working on the computer. I felt terrible when I realized what had happened, and tried to apologize. I answered her 3 hours after she texted me about watching the movie soon. This had never happened to me before, she has sometimes forgot about our scheduled calls.

She got very upset and I didnt really hear anything from her until monday. On monday we texted and she said she feels better, then said
""I had the coffee with the guy today, just to let you know.""

Few months ago she was approached by some guy while walking. They started talking and she ended up giving him her phone number, after telling him she has a boyfriend and they can meet for a coffee as friends. First I was shocked to hear about this, but I trust my girlfriend and in the end this is fine. I know it doesnt sound great to have your girlfriend giving out numbers to random guys, but I choose to trust her not to be stupid.

But now she crossed a line that I wont tolerate. The guy had texted him on saturday, and she was planning to tell me that night. But she got mad at me for forgetting about the movie, and she never told about this until it happened. I got very upset, as I believe it is very disrespectful to do something like this in a relationship, and especially if you are mad and doing it for revenge.

She is now refusing to admit that she did anything wrong. She said many things, such as:
""No revenge, it’s called being independent.""

""I NEVER been disrespectful to you. Even today I was mentioning you many times, because I am loyal and I don’t play around with ”guys”.""

""Whether I tell you before or after doesn’t change the fact that I was honest. The only thing that matters is transparency and trust—and I applied both.""

i (20f) dated a guy (23m), we’ll call him B, for about two months during winter break. i haven’t been in a relationship for a long time (as in, my last “serious” relationship was during my senior year of high school) and none of the people i met on tinder or hinge really cared for me or treated me as seriously as i was hoping for. for the longest time, i’d either receive hookup offers, first dates that went nowhere, or have terrible situationships that would end miserably. 

last december, during winter break, B and i matched on tinder. initially, our first interaction was risque and he essentially asked if he could come over the same day we matched. obviously i didn’t invite him over. but i did think he was cute, and since i didn’t have a lot of expectations at first, i gave him my snapchat and things were quiet for a while. 

about a couple weeks later, he messaged me asking me out to lunch. i said yes. from there, things were starting to look up. we went on dates every week. there was no “do you want to go out again?”, the next date was always assured, no questions asked. he actually wanted to continue seeing me. each date was romantic and soft; he treated me gently and never pushed my boundaries unless i gave him permission to, which was a stark contrast from his intentions at the start. 

feeling confident, i deactivated my accounts on tinder and hinge deleted my dating apps because i felt like things could be different this time. now, i didn’t drop everybody. i had exactly three people in my snapchat from bygone matches who sent me snapstreaks. i didn’t go out with them at all, much less even talk to them. this is inportant to know. i essentially deleted everyone else that i matched with.

on the third or fourth date i asked him if he was seeing anyone else. he said no, and so did i. but we agreed to keep the relationship unlabeled for now and not rush into anything, and figure it out as we kept dating. 

i would hardly sleep; i stayed up late excited for our dates and woke up early to doll up. he would always listen to my stories and let me yap as long as i wanted to. he was kind and sweet and prioritized me. i didn’t want to force him to make me his girlfriend or rush his choice, so i gave him time to think. i did ask if he considered me his girlfriend on one of our last dates, and he said “no”, so i didn’t want to pressure him. 

we start sending risky texts to each other. one thing leads to another, kisses become longer and hotter, and then one day, about 1.5 months in, i went to his place and lost my virginity. thinking back this was probably a mistake. but i wanted him so badly and i thought sexualizing myself would make him want me, too. i made it clear that i wanted it to be him, that i trusted him that much and hoped would deepen our relationship. again this was probably stupid but it’s already happened. 

three days later he cut me off due to “mental health” reasons and trauma dumped on me without prompting. it was intense. he was suicidal. i was not ready at all for the bomb he dropped on me. because of his stress, his money, school, and his family he told me that he couldn’t handle this relationship and wanted to end things immediately. i told him that we should talk more about this and that i could help him but he left no room for discussion. justifiably upset in my opinon, i blocked him everywhere. 

two weeks later, i go back to tinder, feeling vengeful. i hooked up with someone, and, surprise surprise, guess who i found on tinder again? i rematched with B and he explained that he went BACK onto tinder to look for me so i would take him back. i thought that was total bullshit. i told him i felt like he didn’t take me seriously (he hid me from his family while i made it clear i told mine about him). he said he didn’t think I took HIM seriously because he saw snapchat notifications on my phone. (**EDIT** he thought we were we already in an exclusive relationship but did NOT communicate this to me AT ALL.) we acknowledged that there were some pretty crazy miscommunications and agreed to meet for coffee. 

i was still angry, confused, and upset, and didn’t know how to re-approach B. i didn’t know whether i could trust him. i definitely came off kinda bitchy for a while. the weather was also horrible that week (this was around january-february? with the awful snowstorms around the midwest region) so i told him i was unsure if we could meet. he sent me a cold text about how things “would never be the same again” and soon after, blocked me. 

i was heartbroken. i was upset, but i did want to talk things out and start over. i drove to his house and begged, which was totally pathetic, but he told me he already moved on. i deleted all our saved snaps and he blocked me. i didn’t want to be the reason he was unhappy, so i tried to force myself to move on too because he was clearly over it. or so i thought. 

later, i found an old linkedin message from him asking me to text him back, and that’s when i realized he really wasn’t kidding at all. he recently unblocked my number, and definitely saw my texts, didn’t reply, and re-blocked me. i saw him on tinder and hinge a few days ago too. 

i’ve just been depressed and empty about this whole thing. i can’t get over him at all, and wish i did things differently. i wonder if he even is over me because of his behavior as of late, and considering the way things ended as well. he definitely treated me like i was special to him and now i’m nothing. it’s just hard, especially when factoring in my dating history. i really thought he’d be different or more communicable but we ended in a disaster. he wasn’t perfect, but i miss him to the point where i break down in tears almost daily. i can barely sleep at night. i’m trying to move on by focusing on other things and exercising and everything in the dang book, but nothing is working. what do i do? should i call him somehow? 

TLDR: me and this guy had a beautiful situationship that ended in a dumpster fire and i want him back expeditiously. tell me how i should cope with this loss.

One tiny thing in ours is a flavoring / sweetener by Lakanto (vanilla monkfruit drops). With a strong natural vanilla flavor and clean sweetness in a tiny form factor, they make coffee special, turn plain water into a thin vanilla milkshake, and can turn anything into a dessert. No refrigeration required and a few drops goes a long way. I just put 10 bottles in our deep pantry, figuring we can use them to cheer ourselves up and to spread some cheer to others along the way. 

Freeze dried instant coffee (we like Moccona brand) is another tasty indulgence, and we can buy some in single serving packets to be able to share or barter. 

Flavored John West tuna can be a real treat. 

Some nice scented candles among the plain ones and the battery operated ones (with lots of spare batteries). 

Chocolate chips for a nibble of chocolate that won’t get eaten all at once. 

Spice mixes to jazz things up. (Can make a variety pack to take on the road using a pill sorter - especially the kind that screws together into a tower.)

With a little creativity, you can offer guests something they’ll actually use, and every time they do, they’ll think of your special day. Here are some unique and functional wedding favor ideas that will make a lasting impression.

**1. Personalized Reusable Water Bottles**

Hydration is key, especially during a long day of celebrating. Why not gift your guests personalized, reusable water bottles? Not only are they eco-friendly, but they’re also practical for everyday use. You can have each bottle engraved with the guest’s name or even a cute quote from your wedding day. They’re perfect for staying hydrated at the event and will serve as a constant reminder of your celebration long after the big day.

A beautifully scented candle can be the perfect gift to create a cozy, relaxing atmosphere at home. Choose a scent that reflects the mood of your wedding or the season. You can have the candles personalized with your wedding date, names, or a small message. They’re not just pretty to look at—they’ll also fill your guests' homes with the fragrance of your wedding day every time they light them.

Why not give your guests a piece of nature with plantable wedding favors? From seed paper bookmarks to tiny potted plants, these favors are both beautiful and sustainable. Guests can take them home, plant them in their gardens, and watch them grow, just like the love you’re celebrating. Choose flowers, herbs, or even trees that hold significance to you and your partner. These plantable favors symbolize growth and a fresh start, making them an especially meaningful gift.

**4. Mini Bottles of Local Spirits**

If you’re hosting a local or destination wedding, mini bottles of local wine, craft beer, or spirits make for a fun, personal touch. It’s a great way to introduce your guests to a drink that’s special to your location or to share your favorite drink with them. You can customize the label with your wedding details, making it both a thoughtful and tasty gift. Guests can enjoy their mini bottle at the wedding or save it for later as a special souvenir.

**5. Edible Treats**

Who doesn’t love a sweet treat? Edible favors are always a hit, and there’s a wide variety of options to suit any theme. You could offer homemade cookies, macarons, chocolate truffles, or even personalized candy bars. If you want to get creative, consider offering a DIY treat bar where guests can assemble their own take-home goodies. Don’t forget to package them in cute, personalized bags or boxes that match your wedding theme.

You can personalize each one with your wedding monogram or a fun quote to add a special touch.

1ja5nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1ja5nyc/sedona_bachelorette_party_cost_breakdown/,Sedona Bachelorette Party Cost Breakdown,"I (28F) just had my bachelorette party (that I planned myself because I wanted to) and I am providing the budget breakdown below so that people can see how much this type of thing costs. I am aware that ""destination"" bachelorette parties are expensive and that I will probably get roasted for it---you do not have to do this if you don't want to or can't afford it!! I went to great lengths to make sure that the cost  was okay with everyone and subsidized a lot of the activities myself. This breakdown is for anyone who is interested in knowing how much it costs. Not looking for feedback on the cost, I just want to share so that others can see how much it truly costs!! 

**Background**

Number of attendees: 5 (including me, the bride). 

I used my bachelorette as an excuse to go on a trip with my closest friends. We all live in different cities and don't get to see each other often. We usually travel to see each other a couple times a year as it is, so I just planned a trip and called it my bachelorette. The group was my two closest friends from high school who I am still close with and my two best friends from college. Everyone has met each other before and know each other quite well. We are not doing a wedding party, but if we were this group would be mine.

Location: Sedona, AZ

As mentioned we all live in different cities. I felt bad having a ""destination"" bachelorette, but since everyone lives far away, they would all have to fly (the most expensive part of the trip) to me anyways, even if I had it in the city where I live. I had 2 people traveling from the west coast, 2 from the east coast, and I live in Chicago. I wanted somewhere \*relatively\* in the middle, something with nature since I don't get that in Chicago, and somewhere it would be warm-ish in March. I originally wanted to do Colorado (more in the middle) but realized it would be too cold to hike and not everyone knows how to ski (plus it's $$$). 

When: early March, Wednesday-Saturday

For a variety of reasons we ended up going in the middle-ish of the week, which did save some money. One friend is in law school and so we went over her spring break. Me and another attendee have flexible schedules and can make this work. The other two work in tech, have unlimited PTO, and told me they didn't have an issue taking the extra days off (know your crowd here people! I realize this isn't possible for everyone). I had to be at a conference in SF starting the Sunday morning following this trip, hence why we ended on a Saturday. People seemed to like this in the end because it gave them Sunday to reset before going back to work. I was able to loop all my travel from Chicago together into one, so it worked well for me too. 

How I planned: 

I sent out a google form to collect everyone's availability, the number of days they would be willing to take off, and how much they would be willing to spend. I was cognizant when researching locations of how much it would cost once we were there and also how much the flights would be from each of the guests' home airports.

I planned the trip, got quotes for everything (including all their flights), decided what I would pay for, and then sent out an invite with exactly how much they would have to pay. If I changed my mind of what I wanted to do, or added things in, then I would make up the price difference.

**I asked for guests to pay for their own flights + $380** (basically covers the airbnb and rental car). Once we got there we all split the cost of our meals (including me).

**Itinerary Overview:** I am very type A when it comes to trip planning, so I had a very detailed itinerary. I made a plan for each day but also left us flexibility to play it by ear based on how we were feeling and the weather (I knew it could be mid 60s and sunny or snowing early march in Sedona). 

* Wednesday
   * Everyone flies to PHX
      * 3 of us landed at 10am, got dunkin, picked up the rental car, and waited for the other 2 ppl to arrive around 12pm 
   * drive from PHX to Sedona (1hr45m) 
   * Check into airbnb 3pm and settle in 
   * Late lunch - Tortas de Fuego, $153.31
   * watch sunset at the [Airport Mesa](https://sedona.org/top-attractions-in-sedona-az/airport-mesa-sedona/) and did a short nature walk around the loop
   * grocery store for food and snacks
   * made s'mores around the fire pit at the airbnb and star gazing (Sedona is a Dark Sky community) 
* Thursday 
   * breakfast at the airbnb 
   * coffee shop 
   * It was sunny so this was our major hiking day! We did the [Solider's pass trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/arizona/soldiers-pass-cave-spur-trail) and climbed up into the caves. Hiking in Sedona was the thing I was most looking forward to and it did not disappoint. I was worried it would be too cold but it was perfect!!! We did about 5mi round trip and it took us a bit under 4 hours (including stopping for about an hour at the top to climb in the caves, eat snacks/trail lunch, and admire the view).
   * 5pm late lunch/early dinner - Hide away house, $127.96
      * We had an early-ish dinner after hiking and then had a second later \~girl dinner\~ of cheese and crackers and other snacks at the airbnb that night 
   * walked around the [Tlaquepaque](https://www.tlaq.com/) Arts & Shopping Village
      * This was disappointing and overly touristy. We went to better shops the next day 
   * chilled at airbnb and played a lot of card games, watched a movie and drank wine. 
* Friday 
   * It ended up snowing overnight and into Friday so I felt very lucky that I had planned this to be our mostly inside day. I would have ideally done another shorter hike this morning, but oh well, guess I have to go back.
   * Breakfast at airbnb 
   * We drove around and looked in some shops and got coffee
      * We went to Black Potion coffee that has ""coffee and crystals,"" some souvenir shops, and art galleries 
   * We ate a combo of leftovers from the night before and snacks at airbnb for lunch.
   * Spa in the afternoon at the Hilton at Bell Rock. Spa appointments for everyone was my treat (see prices and details in the cost breakdown below). This was a lovely end to our trip and was great because it was snowing/raining and it was indoors. 
   * Dinner: we got takeout BBQ at Colt Grill and ate it at home at the airbnb 
   * played cards, worked on a puzzle from the airbnb, and drank the bottle of champagne we'd bought.
* Saturday 
   * breakfast at airbnb and checkout by 10am 
   * Psychic reading. Sedona is known for it's energy vortexes and has lots of \~mystical vibes\~ and fortune tellers. We went to Madame V which was way less expensive and looked like less of a rip off (as much as is possible with this kind of thing lol) than a lot of the other places we drove by. I am not generally into this kind of stuff but it was a super fun experience and I would recommend Madame V if you go to Sedona!!! 
   * drove back to Phoenix and dropped off one person at the airport at noon 
   * I originally had bought [day pool passes at the Rise Hotel](https://www.resortpass.com/hotels/rise-uptown) for us to chill at while we killed time before heading to the airport ($35pp x4 = $140.82). It ended up not being warm enough that we thought we'd want to get in the pool so I cancelled them the day before (I bought the passes through Resort Pass and wasn't charged until the day before and could cancel up to 24 hrs in advance).  
   * remaining four of us went to lunch in Scottsdale instead, and then walked around while we killed time before heading to the airport around 4pm. We ended up going to a book store and a wine tasting room to try some local AZ wines (better than we expected and a fun way to kill time regardless of the quality). 
   * drop off rental car and fly home.



**Cost Breakdown**

Flights: $491.69 

* The above cost is my round trip airfare from Chicago. Guests bought their own flights to PHX. I offered to pay a portion of one friend's flight who was coming from the farthest and I know for whom the trip would be the most cost prohibitive. They ended up declining my offer because they were able to buy the flight on miles. I told them not to pay me the $380 and I covered most of the rest of their share of things while we were on the trip. 

[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/24648225?source_impression_id=p3_1724343784_P3TUFPqlOjHW_tCP): $1306.75 for 3 nights (Wed-Sat) for 5 people

* This airbnb was sick and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sedona. The architecture was super cool and the uniqueness added a fun element to the trip. It was also really affordable for the area. 

Transport: 

* Rental Car (+gas): $516.32
   * I used Costco travel to get a great deal on a rental car through Budget. We had a Toyota   highlander which fit the five of us comfortably plus our luggage. Pick up/drop off was super easy at PHX. 
* My uber to the airport: $40.96 
   * My flight was at 7am so I took a 5:30am uber to O'hare. I took the train home upon my return which was free since I have an unlimited transit pass. 

Food: 

* Groceries: $213.97
   * We went to the grocery store the first night and got things to make breakfast/snacks in the airbnb throughout the trip. The airbnb did not have a full kitchen so this was pretty basic (oat meal, yogurt, fruit, etc.). We also got 3 bottles of wine, cheese and charcuterie that we had in the evenings, snacks for hiking, and s'more making materials. 
* Restaurants: \~$600 for 5 people 
   * This includes three meals out at restaurants in Sedona (the total cost of these meals ranged from $127-$160 for 5 ppl), Dunkin donuts at the airport ($13.62pp), coffee shop ($7.45pp), Jeni's ice cream in Scottsdale ($5.67pp). This doesn't include lunch the last day in scottsdale which one of my friends paid for. 

Spa: $1052 (including tip)

* We went to the Eforea Spa at [Hilton at Bell rock](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/sdxsehh-hilton-sedona-resort-at-bell-rock/). I paid for everyone's treatments as my gift to them. I gave them the choice of a massage ($175) or facial ($185) and I called in advance to schedule everything. We had access to the spa all day and it included an outdoor heated lap pool, outdoor jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, indoor jacuzzi, and locker room with robes and slippers for everyone. One person decided to get her nails done as well once we got there which she paid for herself (\~$90).

Misc: 

* Paperless Post Invites: $12
   * This was unnecessary, but I made virtual invites on paperless post and sent them to everyone. It included an itinerary, link to the airbnb, and what they were responsible for paying if they wanted to come (their flight + $380). 
* Disposable Cameras: $26.69 
   * I explicitly told them i did NOT want any ""Bachelorette"" themed stuff. I wanted a trip with my friends that happened to be my bachelorette. No themed outfits, no bride sash, no random crap they have to buy. The only thing I got was two disposable cameras that we took pics with that I will get developed. 
* Souvenirs: $52.18
   * I bought a couple post cards, a souvenir for my co-worker, and paid $25 for a psychic reading lol (Sedona is very \~mystical\~ and it was a fun activity). 

Totals:

* Flights: $491.69 (my flights)
* Airbnb: $1306.75 ($261.35pp)
* Transport: $558.28 ($111.66pp)
* Food: $813.97 ($162.79 pp) 
* Spa: $1052 (I paid for this all but would be $210pp)
* Misc: 90.87 

As I said before I asked that guests pay for their own flights +$380 and we split the cost of food while we were on the trip. I paid for everything else. This ended up being **approximately $542 per person plus the cost of their flights** (ranged from $250-$500 based on location). **In total I paid $1864.09 for my share of everything, my flights, the spa, and other stuff I covered.** 

Feel free to ask any questions!!

Ever walked into the kitchen only to stare blankly at the fridge, forgetting why you're there? Happens to the best of us. **Memory lapses** and **brain fog** can be frustrating, making daily tasks feel like mental gymnastics.

If your focus drifts faster than a goldfish's attention span, you might be on the hunt for a solution.

**Brain health supplements** claim to sharpen memory, but **capsules can take forever to absorb**.

So the clever bods at [MindQuell](https://theworldhealth.org/mind-quell-official) designed an innovative offering ...

This **liquid memory supplement** claims **faster absorption** and a blend of **natural brain boosters**. But is it the **best liquid memory supplement for brain health**, or just another overpriced potion? Let’s dig in.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **MindQuell**
* **Category:** **Health & Wellness ➝ Brain & Memory Supplements**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.8/5**

# What is MindQuell?

MindQuell is a **cognitive enhancement supplement** that claims to improve **memory recall, focus, and mental clarity**.

Unlike **nootropic supplements for adults** that come in **capsules**, MindQuell uses a **liquid formula** for quicker absorption.

One **major advantage** is its **365-day money-back guarantee**. If you don’t see results, you have an entire year to request a refund. That’s confidence most **memory enhancement supplements** don’t offer.

✔ **Moringa** – Antioxidants help prevent brain cell damage.

🌱

✔ **Best time to take it:** Mornings, for all-day **mental clarity**.  
✔ **How long until results show?** Some users report subtle changes in a few weeks, while others notice improvements after 2-3 months.

Since it's a **liquid brain supplement**, it may **work faster than capsules**, which need to be digested before absorption.

# Benny's Personal Experience : 60 Days

My dad's friend Benny, a retired engineer with a **love for problem-solving**, has always been sharp as a tack. 

He spends his days **tinkering with old radios, fixing things around the house, and reading technical manuals for fun** (yes, really).

But recently, he started noticing that **recalling names and small details** wasn’t as effortless as it used to be.

When I [told him about MindQuell](https://theworldhealth.org/mind-quell-official), he was skeptical but agreed to give it a shot. He **added it to his morning coffee** and stuck with it for a few weeks.

""The taste? Not bad. A little herby, but nothing I can’t handle,"" he reported.

After about a month, he started **noticing subtle changes**—his **mental clarity improved**, and he wasn’t second-guessing himself as much in conversations.

By the second month, he felt his **focus and concentration** sharpen. He could **troubleshoot circuits and recall technical details** faster, something he hadn't thought much about before.

The only thing he didn’t love? **The wait for results**. ""I expected something more immediate,"" he admitted, ""but I can tell it’s working now.""

For Benny, **MindQuell wasn’t a quick fix, but a steady improvement**, and one he’s willing to keep using.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;)

First abit about me :  , im watching a Dutch streamer and having some caffeine and other drugs lol  . fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream. I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and journaling.i also like watching sit-coms and old shows. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .  that’s about it nothing special .

**Things to expect if we become friends**

* Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
* a lot of random playlist I’ve made
* complaints about nonsensical things
* someone that you can annoy at any time of the day
* someone to have coffee dates with virtually
* just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

Does that sound good to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyway ;))

We constantly have arguments about this subject and I always insist that I am right and refuse to budge on this topic as this is the way it’s always been in any relationship I have been in . It is my belief that there are certain responsibilities that fall on either her or myself depending on circumstances.  For example let’s say only she has a license , but I have a steady income where as she does not .  It is my belief that as such any errands that require driving become her responsibility and that just goes with being part of a the couple unit that is us at that time.  And similarly since I make the money , it is my responsibility to pay for things we require like groceries and bills or whatever.   Am I the asshole for thinking that her doing these errands is not her doing some big favour to me and I shouldn’t need to financially compensate her for her time when any money she spends while doing them is coming out of my pocket?   It’s not like I expect her to work off all the money she spends on frivolous things while she’s out like 8 dollar coffee from Starbucks etc.   so am I the asshole?
