Her mind went back. Her parents' divorce. A public, ugly mess. Infidelity splashed across tabloids. It had made her terrified of commitment, of being fooled. Liam had pursued her for three long years. Relentless, charming...","# My Husband's Double Life

My life with Liam Goldstein was a fairytale, a perfect love story plastered across every magazine and TV screen in Manhattan. He'd even unveiled the ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace, a multi-million-dollar cascade of sapphires, celebrating our perfect devotion.  
But fairytales are just that -- tales. Then came the burner phone, the hushed calls, the screenshots, and hotel receipts that screamed 'a\*\*air'. I watched him live-stream gifts to his young mi\*\*ress, Ava Sinclair, calling her his ""queen,"" only to later find her visibly pr\*\*nant in a hospital, flaunting our engagement necklace and talking about a ""situation"" with me. His friends, the same ones who toasted our ""perfect love,"" smirked as he publicly k\*ssed Ava and joked about his ""side action,"" assuring her I'd ""never find out."" Every grand gesture he'd made, from donating a kidney to cultivating a white rose garden, flashed before my eyes, revealing themselves as calculated performances. How could the man who saved my life, the one I vowed to, betray me with such grotesque audacity, in front of the world and his complicit inner circle?  
It felt like a sick cosmic joke, a public h\*miliation disguised as love.  
But I had given him a warning on our wedding day: ""If you ever lie to me, truly lie, I will vanish from your life as if I never existed.""  
Now, it was time to activate the Phoenix Initiative, erase Maya Goldstein, and leave Liam with nothing but ghost of a promise he had shattered.

**Chapter 1**  


Maya Evans dialed the number. It was a number she knew by heart, a lifeline to an ending. Phoenix Initiative,"" a quiet, professional voice answered. Client Nightingale,"" Maya said, her voice even.She stood by the large window of her Manhattan penthouse, looking down at the city that had been her stage. We are prepared to activate upon your confirmation, Nightingale. Confirm,"" Maya said. ""Full protocol. Erase Maya Goldstein. There was a pause, then, ""Understood. Activation in progress.""The call ended. Maya lowered the phone, a burner, and dropped it into a glass of water on the sleek, modern countertop. It was done. The first step. A news report played softly on the oversized television in the living area. Liam Goldstein, her husband, was on screen. He was at a charity gala, charming, handsome. The report replayed the moment from last week: Liam unveiling the ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace. A cascade of sapphires and diamonds, a multi-million dollar spectacle. The newscaster gushed, ""A testament to their perfect love, a love story for the ages."" Maya watched, a bitter taste in her mouth. Perfect love. If only they knew. The news segment continued, a montage of Liam's devotion. ""Four years ago, Mr. Goldstein donated a kidney to his then-fiancée, Maya, saving her life."" Footage of Liam, looking weaker but smiling, beside a recovering Maya in a hospital bed. He cultivated an award-winning white rose garden at their Hamptons estate, simply because white roses are her favorite. A breathtaking shot of the sprawling garden. And who can forget the privately published 'Book of Us,' a collection of their most cherished moments, a true romantic gesture. Close-up of a beautifully bound book. Maya felt nothing watching it now, only a cold, hard knot in her stomach. The public saw a saint. She knew the devil. Her mind went back. Her parents' divorce. A public, ugly mess. Infidelity splashed across tabloids. It had made her terrified of commitment, of being fooled. Liam had pursued her for three long years. Relentless, charming, seemingly sincere. He learned she coveted a rare first-edition book. He found it at a high-stakes, underground auction. There was a scuffle, an accident. Liam was badly injured, almost died, all to get her that book. That grand, dangerous gesture. It had finally, foolishly, convinced her. He had proposed then, in the hospital, pale but triumphant, the book on his bedside table. She remembered her words, clear and precise, at their lavish wedding. A vow that was also a warning. She'd looked him in the eyes, her hand in his. I can forgive many things, Liam,"" she'd said, her voice soft but firm in the silent church. But not deceit. If you ever lie to me, truly lie, I will vanish from your life as if I never existed. He had smiled, kissed her hand, promised her eternal honesty. A promise he had shattered. Three months ago. That was when her world had cracked. Late nights Liam claimed were ""investor meetings."" Hushed phone calls he'd take on the balcony. A burner phone, hidden deep in his gym bag, discovered by chance. And then, the undeniable proof. Screenshots, messages, hotel receipts. An a\*\*air with Ava Sinclair, a young, ambitious influencer. Maya had felt the ground disappear beneath her. She had meticulously gathered more evidence, planned her exit. Yesterday, she signed the divorce papers. She placed them neatly inside the velvet-lined ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace box. The real necklace was probably still with him, or with Ava. Liam came home late, just as she finished with the Phoenix Initiative. He claimed it was a ""business trip to Chicago.""

He looked tired, but his eyes held a familiar spark of excitement she now knew wasn't for her.

Faint, almost invisible scratches, high on his neck, disappearing into his collar.

He tried to kiss her. She turned her head slightly.

""Long trip,"" he said, trying to sound casual.

He pulled out the actual ""Maya's Horizon"" necklace. It glittered under the lights.

""I had it cleaned,"" he said, his voice smooth. ""For our anniversary next week.""

Liar. He'd probably been showing it off to Ava, letting her touch it.

The thought made Maya feel sick.

She picked up the identical, but empty, necklace box from the coffee table.

The one with the divorce papers inside.

""I have an early anniversary gift for you too, Liam,"" she said, her voice carefully neutral.

She handed him the box.

He looked surprised, then pleased. ""For me? You shouldn't have.""

""Open it in two weeks,"" Maya said. ""On our actual anniversary. For maximum impact.""

Liam, ever confident, ever oblivious, grinned. ""Mysterious. I like it.""

He k\*ssed her forehead, then headed for the shower, humming.

Maya watched him go. Two weeks.

By then, Maya Goldstein would be a ghost.

Chapter 2  
Liam insisted on a ""make-up"" day.

He said he felt distant, wanted to reconnect before their anniversary.

He booked a VIP experience at Universal Studios.

Over-the-top, expensive, and utterly meaningless to Maya now.

He was incredibly attentive, holding her hand, buying her silly souvenirs she didn't want.

Playing the part of the doting husband.

It was a performance, and she was his unwilling audience.

""I'm going to disappear, Liam,"" she thought, watching him laugh at some stunt show.

""You just don't know it yet.""

He pulled her close, nuzzling her neck. ""You're quiet today, beautiful.""

""Just tired,"" she lied.

His touch, once a comfort, now felt like a brand.

He wanted her to stay, to be his perfect wife, his possession.

The thought made her skin crawl.

A young couple approached them, eyes wide with excitement.

""Oh my god, you're Liam and Maya Goldstein, right?"" the girl gushed.

""We're huge fans! Your love story is so inspiring.""

They asked for a photo. Liam, ever the showman, beamed.

He pulled Maya into a practiced embrace.

""Smile, darling,"" he murmured.

Maya forced a smile. She felt like a complete imposter, a fraud.

The flash went off. Another perfect moment captured for a lie.

The couple thanked them profusely, walking away chattering about ""relationship goals.""

Maya wanted to scream.

Liam was on his phone constantly.

""Urgent work stuff, baby, sorry,"" he'd say, turning away.

But Maya saw the screen reflection in his sunglasses once.

Instagram. Ava Sinclair's profile.

Later, while Liam was supposedly on a ""conference call,"" Maya excused herself.

She ducked into a restroom and pulled out her own burner phone.

Ava Sinclair was live-streaming.

From Universal Studios.

""My amazing boyfriend just gifted me this incredible VIP day!"" Ava cooed to her followers, panning her phone camera around a lavish private lounge.

The same VIP lounge Maya and Liam had been in an hour ago.

Ava boasted, ""And he just sent me a virtual castle on my stream! He's EmpireLover, best BF ever!""

EmpireLover. Liam's not-so-secret online handle for his ""indiscretions.""

Maya's stomach churned. The audacity.

The virtual castle gift was a feature on the streaming platform, costing thousands.

Ava's followers were going wild.

""OMG, EmpireLover is loaded!""

""He must really love you, Ava!""

""Is he famous? Spill!""

Then, a comment from EmpireLover himself, Liam, appeared on Ava's stream: ""Only the best for my queen. You deserve the world, Ava.""

Publicly. For everyone to see.

Maya felt a sharp, physical pain in her ch\*st.

It was like watching him tear their life apart, piece by piece, and display it for sport.

The betrayal was so blatant, so cruel.

Chapter 3  
Maya's heart hammered against her ribs.

The pain was so intense, it felt like a physical blow.

Liam returned, all smiles. ""Sorry about that, work crisis averted.""

He put his arm around her. ""Feeling okay? You look a little pale.""

Oblivious. Utterly, maddeningly oblivious.

""Just a headache,"" Maya managed, pulling away slightly.

She looked at him, at the man she had loved, the man who had saved her life, who was now destroying it.

""Liam,"" she began, her voice low, ""if a man, a husband, was having an a\*\*air… what would you think of him?""

He frowned, surprised by the question.

""I'd think he was a sc\*\*bag,"" Liam said, his tone vehement. ""A real piece of tr\*\*h. Especially if he had a wife who loved him, who trusted him. There's no excuse for that kind of betrayal, Maya. None.""

His hypocrisy was breathtaking.

His phone buzzed again. He glanced at it, a flicker of annoyance, then something else -- concern?

""D\*\*n it,"" he muttered. ""Another urgent company matter. Some new intern messed up big time. I have to go deal with it. Marc can't handle this one.""

He k\*ssed her quickly. ""You stay, enjoy the park. I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.""

He hurried off.

Maya watched him go, a cold certainty settling in her.

She pulled out her burner phone, dialed a car service.

""Follow that black Escalade,"" she told the driver, pointing to Liam's departing car. ""Discreetly.""

The Escalade didn't go towards Goldstein Global headquarters.

It headed towards a sleek, new luxury condo building in a trendy downtown district.

The driver parked across the street. Maya waited.

Ten minutes later, Liam walked out of the building.

With Ava Sinclair.

Ava was laughing, clinging to his arm. Liam was smiling down at her, a look of possessive affection on his face.

They stopped by his car in the building's private driveway.

He pulled her close, and they k\*ssed.

A long, p\*\*sionate, o\*en-m\*uthed k\*ss. In broad daylight.

Maya watched, her bl\*\*d turning to ice.

Then, they got into his car. The windows were tinted, but she saw the silhouette.

The car began to rock, gently at first, then more suggestively.

Right there. In the driveway.

Maya closed her eyes.

She remembered their wedding night.

Liam had been so tender, so reverent.

He'd told her he wanted their first time as husband and wife to be perfect, sacred.

He had made love to her with such care, such devotion.

It had felt like a true union of souls.

Now, this.

This cheap, sordid display in a car with his mi\*\*ress.

The contrast was a knife twisting in her gut.

The cab driver, a kind-faced older man, glanced at her in the rearview mirror.

""Miss, are you alright?"" he asked gently.

Maya opened her eyes. Tears were streaming down her face.

""He's not worth it, miss,"" the driver said softly. ""No man who does that is worth your tears. You forgive him, you move on. Find someone better.""

Maya shook her head, a bitter laugh escaping her. ""Forgive him? Never.""

The grand gestures, the kidney, the roses, the book, ""Maya's Horizon.""

All of it, a performance. A trap.

She had warned him. ""If you ever lie to me, truly lie, I will vanish.""

He hadn't believed her. He thought he could manage her, control her.

He was about to find out how wrong he was.

# Chapter 1 Disappointment

On the day I was supposed to get my marriage license, I found myself at city hall bright and early, waiting from 8 AM until it closed.

Just as I was walking out, feeling the curious stares from the crowd, I got a message from Austin Herrera, saying something had come up at work, and we'd need to [reschedule.ac](http://reschedule.ac)

When I got back to our empty house, I opened my phone and saw an Instagram post from Austin's childhood sweetheart: \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\]

The photo showed a beautiful scene on an island, and in the corner, I could still see a guy with a well-defined physique.

Scrolling through the comments, it was all compliments and a bit of playful envy about having such a great friend.

After giving the post a like, I decided to reach out to my friend. \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

I'd been in love with Austin for six years, and during that time, I'd transformed from a young girl into a woman nearly thirty.

My family had been all about the wedding talk, and I kept bringing up marriage with Austin, but he always seemed to put it off.

Just when I thought I might be done waiting, he surprised me by proposing in public not too long ago.

Today was supposed to be the big day for us to get our license.

Two days ago, my mom called out of the blue, saying, ""Sweetie, I consulted someone, and they say the day after tomorrow is a perfect day for you to get your license.""

I couldn't help but laugh, and of course, Austin heard me. He pulled me into a warm embrace and assured me he was all in for anything I needed.

But then, right before our license appointment yesterday, he suddenly started packing his bags for a business trip. Before he left, he gently ruffled my hair and said, ""Don't worry, it's just for a day. I'll definitely be back in time.""

Looking into his calm eyes, I held back the words I wanted to say. I just smiled as I dropped him off at the airport, feeling happy. Even last night when we talked, he swore he was already at the airport.

Today, I woke up early, put on some light makeup, and headed to the city hall with my driver's license in hand. I couldn't help but daydream about the amazing life we'd have together.

As time ticked by, the fresh rose in my hand slowly wilted. I called Austin multiple times, but none of my calls went through, and I couldn't shake the worry that something might have happened to him.

I even reached out to a coworker who was supposed to be traveling with him, trying to get some intel. Turns out, they hadn't been on any trip at all.

""Ms. Parks, I heard Mr. Herrera took a week off just to get ready for the wedding. I'd be thrilled to attend your wedding,"" the guy said.

""I'll see you then,"" I replied, chuckling weakly before hanging up.

I still found myself wondering if this whole thing was some sort of surprise that Austin was planning for me.

When I finally got home, the place was empty, and as I flipped the lights on, I realized there wasn't going to be any surprise waiting for me after all.

Feeling a bit let down, I collapsed on the couch and tried to clear my mind about what Austin was actually up to.

Just then, I got a message from Austin: \[The company had a temporary issue. We'd have to get the license some other time.\]

I replied with a simple \[Sure.\]

Then, out of curiosity, I opened Instagram and found a post from Austin's childhood sweetheart. \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\] It was accompanied by a photo of an island.

There was a girl in a cute swimsuit lounging under a coconut tree, donning a wide sun hat and carrying a limited edition bag. And in the reflections of her sunglasses was a solidly-built guy snapping a pic of her.

Yeah, that was definitely Austin off on a supposedly ""temporary"" commitment.

Scrolling through the comments, I saw others lamenting how they wished they had a brother like him.

I couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, I felt pretty foolish. Just earlier, I was all worried about him, and now here I was, making excuses for his obvious lies.

I was so hopelessly dumb.

A dull ache settled in my chest. I'd been in love with Austin for six long years, and those sweet moments we shared were often tainted by things that didn't really belong to us.

There was his childhood sweetheart, Rosemary Read. Her parents had passed away when she was young, and she ended up being raised in Austin's home, which made them incredibly close, almost like siblings.

On my birthday, I'd find myself blowing out candles alone while he'd get wrapped up in some excuse related to Rosemary. He'd even bring her along on our dates, saying he couldn't leave her alone at home.

And when he finally proposed, he bought her a dress from the same collection he picked for me because, apparently, she liked it too.

All those memories flooded back, and every argument we had over Rosemary ended with that same phrase from him. ""She's just my little sister.""

My heart sank a little deeper, especially knowing he was off vacationing on some island with Rosemary while I sat at home waiting for him.

Six years. How many more of these could I take? Growing up without a father, I always wanted a complete family, dreaming that my future kids would have a happy home.

I smiled bitterly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out.

I even liked this post, hoping he'd take a hint. Then, I turned around and casually messaged a friend: \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Austin returned home three days later. He walked in with an icy chill hanging around him and stood in the foyer, waiting for me to come help with the bags.

I stayed put on the couch, not giving him a glance.

When I didn't move, he finally spoke up, ""Laurel, I'm home."" I just hummed and kept my eyes glued to the TV.

Noticing something was off, he hung his snow-drenched jacket by the door and made his way over to me. He wrapped me in his arms and softly asked if I was upset.

""Laurel, I'm sorry. That project was a bit tricky,"" he said.

I tuned into his steady heartbeat, which didn't skip a beat even when he lied.

""I saw Rosemary's Instagram,"" I shot back, locking my gaze on him to see how he'd react.

When I dropped Rosemary's name, I could see his face tighten with annoyance, and I could hear it in his voice. ""Rosemary just happened to be there, and I swung by for her birthday. How many times do I have to tell you I think of her like a little sister?""

Just like I thought, he was sticking to the same old script. ""Oh, so you had time for her birthday but no time to give me a call?"" I asked.

During the time I couldn't reach him, my mind raced, wondering if he was safe. I felt a lump in my throat as I fought to hold back tears in front of him.

Austin pressed his lips together and stubbornly added, ""What difference does it make? We still couldn't get a license anyway.""

I looked at him, the guy I'd spent six years with, and felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. For a moment, I didn't even want to argue.

Just then, the doorbell rang. I got up to answer it, and it was Rosemary. She had a big bag in her hand and smiled warmly at me. ""Laurel, you're here. I brought Austin's stuff he left at my place.""

She handed me the bag, revealing a bracelet around her wrist.

My heart dropped when I saw it, and I froze as I took the bag in my hands. That bracelet was special. Austin had traveled to several cities to get it for me.

When he gave it to me, he said, ""I hope this brings you luck.""

Turns out, what I thought was something unique between us, he had given to Rosemary too.

""Sorry, Laurel,"" Rosemary said, her hands together and her head tilted, her eyes wide with innocence.

# Chapter 2 Break Up

""You're not upset that Austin took me on vacation for my birthday, are you?"" Rosemary asked.

I looked at her, not saying a word, and quietly closed the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*\*

I went cold turkey with Austin. Every time we fought about Rosemary, it would spark a silent war. Austin had gotten used to this pattern, knowing that after three days, I'd be back in front of him, ready to make up.

I hadn't even drifted off to sleep when there was a loud knock at my door.

""Laurel!"" Austin shouted, his voice filled with frustration.

I opened the door, and he shoved his phone at me. ""How many times do I have to say it? Rosemary is just my sister! Why do you take it so personally?""

I was clueless. ""What did I do to her?""

""And you have the nerve to ask! Did you say something to her when she came over? Mom said she's been off since she got back, and now she's in the hospital because of her depression!""

I glanced at Austin's phone, the screen showing a picture of Rosemary lying weakly in a hospital bed, her wrist wrapped in thick gauze.

""I didn't say anything to her,"" I said. I was being honest.

Austin said to me sharply with one hand around my neck, ""If anything goes wrong with Rosemary, you can forget about marrying me.""

I wanted to call him a psycho, but I couldn't get half a sound out of my throat, and I frantically scratched at Austin's hand, desperate for him to let me go.

Just when I felt like I might pass out, he threw me to the ground and looked down at me, condescendingly saying, ""After everything we've been through, if you don't go after Rosemary again, I might actually think about marrying you.""

With that, he turned and stormed downstairs, snatching the keys from the table before slamming the door behind him.

I was left sitting on the floor, struggling to catch my breath. It felt like my heart was completely shattered. He made these wild accusations without a shred of proof, and it was like he was losing it over it all.

I wobbled a bit as I pushed myself up, steadying myself against the wall, and grabbed the phone that had been ringing off the hook on the nightstand.

""Laurel, it's been ages! Want to grab a drink?"" It was Erin George, my high school classmate, someone I hadn't seen in years.

She had just landed in Newton City and was only around for a day before she headed back.

Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I agreed to meet her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Erin had reserved a fancy dining room and invited a few of our close friends from the area. The vibe was chill as we all caught up, sharing stories from our lives while reminiscing about the good old times.

""So, Laurel, how are things with you and Austin? Still not married?"" Erin shot me a teasing look.

Back in the day, everyone figured Austin and I would end up together since we were high school sweethearts who went to the same college.

I tugged at the collar of my turtleneck sweater, avoiding eye contact as I swirled the wine in my glass before downing it. ""Nope. Guess it just wasn't meant to be.""

Polly Maxwell frowned, leaning in. ""Is it you or him who doesn't want it anymore?""

""It's him,"" I replied, feeling the weight of those words.

Suddenly, Polly slammed her hand on the table hard enough to send her fork clattering to the ground. ""Is it because of Rosemary? I warned you ages ago that she'd always be in the way between you two, but you wouldn't listen!""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and shake my head. I always thought Austin just liked pampering his ""sister.""

""Rosemary?"" Laura Watson chimed in, pulling out her phone to show us something.

She played a video that caught everyone's attention: there was Rosemary, wildly banging on a middle-aged guy with her heel. The man held her wrists firmly and was telling bystanders, ""My wife is just having a tantrum, so don't mind her.""

With tears in her eyes, Rosemary was begging, ""No, please help me!""

The video ended with a tall guy standing up to confront the burly man, announcing that the police were on their way. Just before he left, the burly guy leaned in to whisper something threatening to Rosemary.

""It went viral in my neighborhood—everyone was saying the guy was a psychopath and warned to be careful when going out."" Laura looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. ""It looked like Rosemary.""

""It's her,"" I said calmly, unable to shake the unsettling feeling.

The woman in the video looked just like Rosemary, from her hair to the outfit she wore.

Austin had vaguely mentioned that Rosemary had been molested as a child, leaving her with deep psychological scars. I couldn't help but think the psycho had something to do with her suicide.

""Quit bringing her up. I told you Austin's no good for you. When the hell are you finally gonna dump him?"" Polly, a bit tipsy, shot me a disapproving look, like she was ready to jump on me if I said I still had feelings for Austin.

Outside, the rain drizzled against the window, and I noticed a dull ache from the bruise on my neck.

I stared at the raindrops sliding down the glass, feeling a bit lost. ""Just a couple more days.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, Austin got in touch again. The whole Rosemary situation had somehow made the news, and I followed it reluctantly.

The report said the man was in a psychiatric hospital, and the girl who was involved was under close protection by her family.

I knew Austin was aware of the truth. When he called, instead of apologizing, he casually informed me he'd be home for dinner tonight. I shrugged it off, ""Anything else?""

The agent waited patiently for me to sign the contract, and I double-checked everything before putting my name down. Austin was quiet for a while, then finally said, ""Laurel, about the other day, I...""

I kept silent, waiting for him to continue. In the end, I didn't get the apology I expected. Instead, he blurted out, ""Let's get married, Laurel. I'll meet you at the city hall tomorrow.""

I couldn't help but smile ironically, feeling an unusual heaviness in my heart.

Had I been so indulgent with him over the years that I'd given him the impression this was how to make it up to me? Did he really think I was that easy to brush aside?

""No, thanks,"" I replied.

His displeasure was clear. ""What do you mean, no?""

I strolled over to the window to take in the view of Newton City, a place I'd been stuck in for what felt like ages. I moved here for Austin since his whole family was based in this city.

I saved up every penny to buy this house, hoping that one day, if I got married, my mom would come to live here with me. It'd make it easier to care for her.

But honestly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pretty selfish, making her move to a strange city just for me. Right now, though, I'd never felt more sober.

""I mean, we're done,"" I said.

Austin was about to say more when I heard Rosemary's voice blaring on the other end. ""Austin, where are you?""

He left me a quick, irritated ""Cut it out"" and hung up.

The agent beside me pretended not to notice the commotion and flashed a smile, saying, ""Ms. Parks, the funds will arrive within 24 hours.""

I nodded and handed him the key. ""Thanks. Here you go.""

# Chapter 3 Choices

After selling the house, I drove back to the place I shared with Austin and opened the door to an eerie stillness.

It seemed Austin hadn't been around for a while—he'd been busy taking care of Rosemary at the hospital.

I couldn't help but smirk a little. Honestly, that was fine by me. I'd rather not run into him.

Most of my stuff was in the second bedroom, and over the years, I'd had my fair share of arguments with Austin about Rosemary.

I had spent my time in that room during the rough patches and felt like I was constantly keeping my head down.

A bitter smile crept across my face as I packed up my things, remembering how submissive I used to be.

I didn't bother keeping anything that reminded me of Austin. Two hours later, I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead with a tissue, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.

Then, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was my mom. I hesitated for a second before answering. ""Hey, Mom.""

Her voice was filled with that familiar mix of excitement and nostalgia. ""Laurel, how's it going? Have you gotten the license yet? Have you and Austin talked about the wedding plans?""

I felt something tighten in my throat as I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

There was a long, awkward silence, and when my mom began to press me, I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, I'm not getting married.""

""What do you mean, Laurel? What's going on?"" Her tone turned anxious.

I tried to explain, ""I just don't think Austin and I are right for each other.""

Her voice rose slightly. ""But Laurel, you've been together forever! Why say this now, right before the wedding? Come on, you're 27, not a kid anymore.""

It struck me that without even asking what I was feeling, she just urged me to get married.

Tears filled my eyes, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from breaking down. After what felt like forever, I found my voice, ""Mom, I really just don't want to marry him.""

My mom didn't hold back her frustration. ""So what do you want, then? Just give up on all these years?""

When she heard my firm answer, her tone shifted. ""Laurel, how can you just say you don't want this after all this time?""

""Well, I just said it,"" I shot back, feeling overwhelmed.

My mom's voice suddenly went all high-pitched, probably still trying to convince me, and before she could make a sound, I heard a dull thud from the other end of the line.

""Mom?"" I called out but got no response.

A wave of panic hit me like a freight train. ""Mom! What's wrong? Please answer me!""

All I could make out was a faint moan of pain coming from her. My heart clenched tight, and I hung up in a hurry, flipping on the home security feed.

In my panic, my phone slipped from my shaking hands, sliding under the couch like it was covered in grease.

I dropped to my knees, desperately reaching for my phone. The security footage showed my mom, clearly in distress, clutching her chest and reaching for her medicine on the table.

All I wanted to do was dive through the screen and hand her the pills she needed.

I had only one thought racing through my mind: save my mom. I quickly opened my contacts and dialed my aunt, Bonnie Porter, who lived in the same building with my mom.

""Come on, pick up!"" I pleaded, praying she'd answer fast.

The ten seconds felt like an eternity, but finally, Bonnie picked up. I burst into tears, sounding like a total mess as I exclaimed, ""Aunt Bonnie, my mom is having an attack! You need to hurry!""

Bonnie sounded surprised but jumped into action, heading over to my mom's place while trying to calm me down.

I hung up and immediately called for an ambulance, anxiously switching back to the feed, just hoping someone would get to my mom in time.

At that moment, I regretted everything about moving to Newton City alone and leaving my mom all by herself. Watching her suffer through a screen felt like a nightmare.

I couldn't help but blame myself for being so hasty in talking to her and pushing her buttons.

The self-loathing and regret were overwhelming. I shouldn't have done that. I was so wrong. I promised myself, never again.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of two minutes, I heard the doorbell chime, signaling that Bonnie had entered the house.

She rushed in, looking almost like an angel descending from above, and quickly administered the medicine from the table to my mom.

Through the monitor, I watched as my mom's pale expression started to ease up while my phone slipped weakly to the floor.

Bonnie called me to let me know that my mom was out of danger, and I insisted she take her to the hospital for a follow-up.

It wasn't until I hung up that I felt like I'd regained my sanity, and my heart, which was racing like crazy, finally calmed down.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up the pace with my packing. The thought of leaving Newton City was getting harder to shake off.

The moving guys were still on their way, so I was waiting and checking in with Bonnie about my mom's condition when, out of nowhere, Austin appeared right in front of me.

The sound of the bouquet hitting the floor snapped me out of my phone trance, and I was taken aback by his sudden presence.

He was all dressed up in a sharp suit and tie, with his hair styled just right, showing off a smooth forehead that gave him a touch of mature charm. A bunch of delicate roses lay discarded at his feet.

His eyes looked stormy, filled with suppressed anger as he gritted out, ""Laurel, what do you mean by that?""

""Didn't I tell you? I want to break up. Do you not get it?"" My emotions were all over the place, and I was starting to lose my patience, saying whatever popped into my head.

He kicked the coffee table in frustration, sending glass flying, and pointed at the photo I had tossed in the trash, shouting angrily, ""I'm going to get a marriage license with you today. What do you mean?""

So that was why he dressed up—he thought we were heading to get a license. I assumed he dressed to the nine to pick up Rosemary from the hospital.

""I don't need that—"" I tried to shoot back.

Before I could finish, he cut me off, ""Didn't I promise to marry you? What do you want? Are you done with your little tantrum? If you don't marry me, what are you going to say to your mom?""

Looking at his smug face, I couldn't help but think he knew how much my mom had been looking forward to my wedding for ages.

So he knew all the time. He kept me waiting for three long years before finally agreeing to marry me, fully aware of my mom's situation.

It was just heartbreaking. What was I even doing falling for him?

I found myself staring at Austin in silence, my eyes reflecting a deep emptiness.

His anger started to fade as he seemed to regain some composure, and he began to softly coax me, ""I was wrong to stand you up, Laurel. Can we move past this?""

My resolve started to waver, but not because of him—it was all about my mom. I really worried that she would get so upset over everything that it would send her into another health scare.

She'd been adamant about me starting a family, and she'd definitely prefer Austin, the guy I've been in love with for years, over some blind date she barely knew.

That bruise on my neck was a constant reminder that I shouldn't just give in. But my mom was still stuck in that hospital bed, and it stopped me cold.

Just as I was about to crack, something unexpected happened that helped me decide what to do.

# Chapter 4 Just A Bad Dream

At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared, and I was taken aback to see Rosemary standing right in front of me.

She looked drained and pale, wearing a white dress that did nothing to hide her distress.

""Laurel, are you mad at Austin?"" Rosemary's eyes were glossy with unshed tears, and there was a mix of fear and helplessness in her expression.

She continued, her voice cracking, ""It's all my fault. I didn't clarify things with Austin, and that's what led to the misunderstanding between you two.""

I remained silent, my gaze fixed on Rosemary.

""Please, don't be angry with him. I'm truly sorry,"" she pleaded, clearly overwhelmed. ""Austin has been planning for ages to get a marriage license with you."" She bit her lip, looking extremely weak.

I was about to reply when Austin, whose face was dark with frustration, said, ""Laurel, enough already. Rosemary came here to apologize—what more do you want from her?""

I noticed the bruise on her wrist, wrapped in cloth, and shifted my attention to Austin, ""Austin, how about you make a choice? You can either have me or Rosemary.""

""That's enough, Laurel!"" he snapped, glaring at me as though he could burn a hole right through me.

The answer had been clear for a while, but here I was, still holding on. Not for him, but for myself. Six years. How did I lose myself in all this and end up loving a guy like him? I had no idea.

I looked at Austin, trying to keep my cool, and gave a faint smile. ""So, if I go celebrate another guy's birthday, hang around when he's sick, and baby him every now and then, does that make me just some shameless woman in your eyes?""

""Laurel, Austin and I are not what you think,"" Rosemary mumbled, her surprise evident.

""Come on, Rosemary. You know Austin and I are getting married, so why do you keep showing up looking all innocent? You're playing the role of the 'good girl' pretty well,"" I shot back.

With those words, Rosemary froze, disbelief written all over her face, and then she burst into tears.

Pop! Austin's brow furrowed in anger as he stared at me, who had been slapped to the ground by him.

""Laurel,"" Rosemary's reaction was immediate as she rushed to help me.

But I caught a glimpse of a smirk creeping onto her lips just before she lowered her gaze. It was quick but telling.

""Fuck off!"" The words flew out before I could stop myself, and Rosemary stumbled back a couple of steps.

""Laurel,"" Austin said, his eyes heavy with disappointment. ""You've turned into a green-eyed monster. Rosemary was just trying to help you, and you went and pushed her away?""

Rosemary started tugging on his arm, stammering, ""Austin, I'm fine. It's my fault. I made Laurel mad.""

I finally managed to stand and let out a soft laugh. ""What a twist! Did I even touch you, Rosemary? No matter what happens, suddenly it's my fault? Am I like some kind of biochemical weapon just for you?""

Rosemary looked stunned, lost for words, but then tears started streaming down her face as if they were on a mission.

""Laurel, I want you to apologize to Rosemary! Or else I'm not getting married,"" Austin demanded, furrowing his brow. He seemed totally unfazed by the breakup talk.

Sure, I usually brought up breakups during our fights, but in the end, all it took was a little coaxing from him, and I'd be back on his side, pretending nothing had ever gone wrong.

I didn't want to dwell on these arguments to protect our feelings.

But suddenly it hit me: what Austin and I had was just me fooling myself, constantly backing down and giving in.

""Austin, we're done. I'm the one who called it off. You both handle it from here,"" I said, wanting nothing more than to walk away from the mess and that scum for good.

With that, I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door, not looking back. Rosemary was still trying to reason with Austin. ""Austin, you should go after Laurel. This is all my fault,"" she pleaded.

""Relax, she's just having a little meltdown. She won't really break up with me,"" Austin assured her.

Once I settled into the cab, I noticed the two of them on the security camera, wrapped up in each other's arms, and I couldn't help but smirk a little. They claimed there was nothing between them, but deep down, I knew the truth.

I raised a hand to my cheek, still tender from Austin's earlier blow, and it felt like a knife twisted in my heart. The ache spread through my body, a reminder of the six years I'd wasted.

I wasn't crying, but my heart felt so heavy it was hard to breathe.

After a moment of reflection, I pulled up the video I had just recorded and posted it on my Instagram.

Since I decided to cut ties with Austin, I figured it was only fitting to finish what they started. I wasn't going to take this slap for nothing.

I crafted my last message: \[A shoutout to those who'd supported me over the past six years. I am officially breaking up with Austin.\]

With a final click, I powered off my phone. Clutching an ice pack over my throbbing head, I glanced at the city disappearing beneath me.

There was a mix of humiliation and anger in my heart, but seeing the bright blue sky somehow lightened the burden a bit.

Before I knew it, I drifted off to sleep, only to wake up with tears streaming down my face. Just then, a long, elegant hand offered me a gray handkerchief.

""Here,"" the owner of the pretty hand said, his voice smooth and calming.

""Thanks,"" I mumbled, taking it awkwardly.

""Are you alright?"" he asked, a note of concern in his tone.

I nodded, forcing a bittersweet smile. ""I'm fine, just a bad dream.""

I dreamt back to the first time I laid eyes on Austin, my heart racing—it was definitely one of those love-at-first-sight moments.

Later on, I even went so far as to lower my standards just to get into the same school as him. I thought it would lead to a better life, but honestly, I was just squandering my best years.

It was interesting how sometimes the wrong person could feel scarier than facing a real demon.

I let out a deep sigh and turned to glance at the guy sitting next to me. Just one look, and my whole body froze.

My heart raced as I managed to stammer, ""Un-uncle Alex, what are you doing here?""

Alex Herrera raised an eyebrow, sizing me up before casually saying, ""Didn't you break up with Austin? Why do you still call me uncle?""

# Chapter 5 An Awkward Encounter

I took a deep breath when I unexpectedly ran into Alex on the plane. How did I end up meeting him here? He was Austin's uncle and Raphael Herrera's youngest son.

In the Herrera family, he was the one everyone feared—especially Austin.

Growing up, Alex was molded to be someone else entirely. When I first heard his name, I pictured a woman, but instead, I found this incredibly handsome guy—more stunning than most women I know.

Not only did he have looks, but he had also got this air of sophistication about him. At a young age, he was already seated as the president of Herrera Group.

Though he was only six years older than Austin, Austin had to call him uncle, and I was dating Austin, so I'd been doing the same.

But now that Austin and I were officially done, it felt silly to still call him that.

""Did you and Austin have a fallout?"" Alex asked, his voice lowered as he crossed his legs, a knowing smile on his face.

""No, it's a breakup,"" I said, trying to sound confident.

""A breakup?"" He looked surprised, still smiling, but I could tell he didn't buy it.

I mean, who could blame him? Being married to Austin, a rich young man from the Herrera family, seemed like a dream for most women.

Besides, after six years together, how could I possibly just walk away from that? Back then, I was all-in on Austin.

Everyone thought I was just lucky to be with him, and honestly, if he'd revealed his true identity back in school, I might not have been his pick in the first place.

Now, I was nearing thirty with nothing to show for it—who was I to break up with him? Even Austin assumed I was head over heels for him and that suggesting a breakup was just me throwing a fit.

""Yeah,"" I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself, trying my best to keep it cool.

""I saw your Instagram."" Alex looked up slowly, his voice still calm and soft.

It felt like the way an elder talked to a younger person, but the light in his eyes—slightly reminiscent of Austin's—hit me with a mix of panic and awe.

I honestly hadn't expected Alex to keep tabs on my Instagram, and I'd even forgotten he had an account. He rarely said much online, just a few holiday photos now and then. I seriously wondered if he even used it himself.

""As long as you've thought it through,"" he added.

I was taken aback for a second, waiting for Alex to drop some words of shame or caution about being impulsive. Instead, he surprised me with his response.

The tension in my chest vanished instantly as I managed a shy smile and nodded silently.

I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the plane touched down and I watched Alex stand up and grab his luggage.

Although he wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, he still had this unshakeable aura that felt heavy.

As I stepped out of the airport, a black Alphard suddenly pulled up right in front of me.

Before I could process it, the driver came over and said, ""Ms. Parks, Mr. Herrera asked me to give you a ride.""

I opened my mouth to decline, but when the window rolled down and I saw that gorgeous face, words just vanished.

At that moment, it hit me—Austin's fear of Alex was totally justified. The guy had such a strong presence that I felt too timid to say no.

""Get in the car. It's going to rain soon,"" Alex said, glancing at me with that cool gaze.

I found myself sliding into the car without a second thought. Sitting beside him, I quickly masked my emotions. My face was calm, but inside, I felt this strange unease.

After all, I had just broken up with Austin. Why would Alex bother giving me a ride? Was it just because of the rain? Or maybe he felt sorry for me?

Trying to figure it out was a lost cause, especially since Alex and I had only crossed paths a few times.

It was not like a guy like him would focus on someone like me. Maybe it was just pity, some kindness for someone who had just got out of a serious relationship. Honestly, I decided not to overthink it.

""Where to?"" Alex's calm voice pulled me out of my thoughts.

""The hospital,"" I replied almost automatically, without thinking twice.

Honestly, I felt a bit awkward saying that, but I was already thankful that I kept my home address under wraps.

All of a sudden, it started pouring rain. It didn't even register with me that it was actually raining.

Half an hour later, we pulled up outside the hospital. The driver got out, grabbed my luggage from the trunk, and strolled over with an umbrella in hand.

As I stepped out, I glanced back at Alex, who was sitting in the car with his eyes half-closed. I swallowed my thanks and left.

Taking my suitcase and turning my back to the sleek black car, I finally let out a long sigh of relief.

In my mind, I couldn't shake the image of Alex's striking profile. He was clearly in his early thirties but carried an air of maturity that made him seem older.

It was a shame, too, because, with a face like that, Alex would probably attract a lot of young admirers.

As I walked into the hospital and fished out my phone, a call came in from an unknown number. After a brief moment of hesitation, I hit the answer button.

""Laurel, what the heck is wrong with you? Do you even realize that Rosemary is sick because of you?"" It was Amanda Herrera, Austin's mother, and her angry voice echoed through the line.

I stood there for a second, stunned, gripping my suitcase tightly.

""Laurel, you need to come back right now and apologize to Rosemary. Clear things up online and say you posted that video by accident. We'll let this slide!"" Amanda demanded.

I instinctively ran my fingers over my throat, which still felt a bit sore.

I was relieved that I hadn't gone through with getting a license with Austin.

Honestly, I was grateful for the last three years of not marrying him. It took me a while to truly see how ridiculous I was being.

Looking back on the past six years, it felt like I'd thrown a piece of my heart to the wolves.

I looked at her and said, ""Mrs. Herrera, Austin and I are through. So, do me a favor and don't bother me again.""

""Laurel, enough already! You're really crossing the line here. My mom called you—so what the hell do you want from me?"" Austin's voice came through, sharp and frustrated.",1,1750270076.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Aum-La turned around, eyebrow ridges raised. “Hmm? Oh, no, they get dressed up in costumes and hand out candy to children.”

“... What?!” The Pwah shouted, the excitement on his face turning to outrage as the Drafritti all quietly laughed at him. “Candy?!”

Aum-La nodded, pulling up the pictures of Human and Drafritti children running around a street packed with other revelers. “Mhm. They conduct hit and run operations known as ‘trick or treating’ in order to gain candy and other such treats. They also carve pumpkins, create haunted houses, and have all a manner of activities.”

“Oh, I like the pumpkins!” Tyllia said in a hushed yell to another nearby yellow Kafya, which made Aum-La snort.

“Alright, let’s start with the beginnings of Halloween, which actually stem from Samhain, where they would leave out food for the dead, and other such things to honor their ancestors.” Aum-La began, already tapping along on the pad of her thumb.

—

Rhidi leaned to the side as her ship came out of their last skip, slowing down to its normal speed as it hurtled through the void of space. 

She looked down at her data-slate, then tapped the circle to stop the timer. She did some mental math then whistled, hooking in the last cable to her data-display. “Must be in a rush now, we were skipping for well over six hours. Hope that big bastard next to us can handle it.”

They had been slip-skipping alongside the Moose, with the other ships all staying locked in certain positions. Slip-skipping was common for fleet movements, with the large ship causing the rip and then everyone else slamming into it at the same time. Rips only stay open for a minute or two, so a wide rip is made so all ships can hit it at once.

“Skip complete.” Came a voice over the ship comms, the sounds of a busy bridge just audible behind it. “We are ahead of schedule with a two day cool down. Fastest skip was five hundred and three leesoo.”

Rhidi snorted to herself, chuckling in her throat as she brought the display online. “*Leesoo*, they are so silly.”

Leesoo was a verbalization of the LYSU, or “light year speed units”. The Inner Dolcir Coalition had tried plenty of times to get the Humans to adopt the shared “skip travel acceleration measurements”, but apparently STAM was not as fun to say as LYSU.

Rhidi squinted her eyes at the display as it warmed to life, coming into crystal clarity as power surged through it.

“Alriiight!” Rhidi called out, rapidly clapping the tips of her pawed hands together as she leaned forward. “Now I can get caught up on Band Of Brothers!”

Rhidi picked up her smaller data-slate and sent a message to ‘the girls’ group communication, then started pulling out her bags of snacks. She had gotten the little idea while they had been skipping, timing the rattling and bouncing of the ship to quickly run back out to the PX for a few more snacks.

There was a knock at her door, and she leaned back with her foot to press the release. Saffi quickly jerked open the door, pillow in hand, before Rhidi could recover, finding the yellow Kafya fully stretched out while holding two bags of snacks.

“... Doin a little yogurt there?” Saffi asked with a teasing smile, sliding in and shutting the door behind her.

Rhidi puffed out a single breath of a laugh and came back to center, shaking the bags in her hands. “No, I was just… wait, yogurt?”

“Yeah, you know, yogurt. The weird poses the Humans do.” Saffi said over her shoulder, bending over at the waist to admire the large data-display. “Wow, this thing is huge! I could only afford one of the little ones.”

Rhidi politely pushed Saffi’s wagging green tail out of the way, rolling her eyes as she started setting out the snacks. “*Yoga*, Saffi. That’s called yoga, not *yogurt*.”

“Ah potato tomato.” Saffi said, flapping her hand behind her back. “Do you think we should start all the way over? I *really* want to watch ‘crossroads’ again, but Uppil keeps wanting to watch ahead!”

Rhidi peeled open a can of bean dip, setting it down beside a bag of chips. “No Saffi, we have to watch them *in order* first, then we can skip around and watch the good scenes.”

“Man! I don’t like the snow scenes.” Saffi grumped, tossing her pillow on the ground before sitting on it, crossing her arms across her chest. “It’s just snow, explosions, and more snow!”

A knock came at the door again, and Saffi reached up, unlocking it so Uppil, Dimili, Enflia, Imridit, Anfilid, and Marides could come inside.

“Oooh, look at the big spender with the wide display!” Marides said, also bending over at the waist with the rest of the newly arrived. “Man, you can even see their pores on this display.”

Anfilid giggled. “Spiers looks like even more of a snack now.”

“Don’t be weird, Anfilid.” Uppil sighed out as she rolled her eyes. “Besides, everyone knows Shifty is the cutest trooper in the movie.”

Dimili laughed, helping Rhidi open up more of the snacks. “She has you there, Anfilid.”

“No she *doesn’t*.” Anfilid muttered, snatching up a bag of tortilla chips.

Another knock came at the door, and Oin soon joined them all carrying her own bag and pillow. “I brought more stuff to eat, since we’re going to be suffering all of tomorrow. That ‘dropper-meal’ was a joke.”

“I thought it was rather nice, myself.” Anfilid replied, fluffing up her sitting pillow.

Imridit cracked her toes from her perch on Rhidi’s bed. “Surprise of surprises, Anfilid likes *peanut butter*.”

“Peanut butter sandwiches and a litre of milk, the fucking audacity…” Oin grumbled, fishing for her salmon fillet that was at the bottom of the bag. “They better have better stuff next time, or I am going to riot.”

Marides laid back on her pillow, resting her shoulders against the enclosure for Rhidi’s bed. “I assume they will, the whole menu is on the ship’s data-layout. Said tomorrow was paprika beef and bread.”

“Thank fuck for that.” Oin replied, snuggling down onto her own pillow. “We finished ‘crossroads’, right?”

Rhidi nodded, setting out everything within arms reach of her guests; She may have been *Kholihl*, but she was also the host for tonight. “We’ll be watching all the way to ‘the breaking point’ tonight, since we need to sleep.”

“Yes *mama*.” Dimili muttered as Rhidi turned on the movie, the yellow Kafya cocking an eyebrow at the brown while everyone else tittered in quiet laughter.

“Keep talking like that and you’ll be going to bed hungry.” Rhidi said in a sideways manner, pressing play on her data-slate.

There was another “Yes mama” whispered by someone which caused more laughter, but they quickly settled down as the episode began to play.

Slowly the episode began to find its legs, going into the process that Easy Company had to endure while holding their lines within Bastogne. As the shelling began, startling the members of Easy Company, Imridit swallowed her mouthful of cheese whiz and crackers in order to speak.

“Is that how it really was? Just having to sit there and take artillery coming in? Is it the same way for the Regs?” Imridit asked, watching with wide eyes as American soldiers dove for their foxholes.

Oin shrugged. “The second world war was a harsh theater, but this is how it really was. They would just shell the shit out of each other for days on end before attempting a push. Ruined their sleep, kept them on edge, all while they froze in the cold.”

“Seems like such a rough way to wage war…” Marides murmured, popping another gummy shark into her mouth. “Just sitting there, waiting.”

Uppil started peeling her orange, squinting at the display as those on screen screamed and suffered. “No one waged war like the Humans. They are patient, and the Human Regs honestly scare me more than the Human HOIs. They are fast, violent, and dig in like feral animals when they need to. Not even the Ur could dig out a Human, no matter how hard they tried.”

“They tried all they could, but it didn't really get them far.” Anfilid said, her voice distant. “When we were being overrun, Human Regs came down in ships, piling  out around us and deploying combat dozers. They had a line dug in a matter of hours and stabilized us all. The Ur started shelling us, a lot like this, but the Humans held firm while we all cowered in the shadows of their trenches. I had never seen someone stand proud and laugh through an artillery strike… it was like they thought the Ur were playing.”

Rhidi tossed a bean dip covered chip into her mouth, gazing idly at the screen. The episode progressed into the actual first proper attack onto Easy Company’s positions, German vehicles roaring through the forest as they advanced.

The Kafya and Pwah watched quietly, a room of veterans that had seen first hand what it was like to fight alongside Humans. Despite the chaos, spilled coffee across trousers, and machine gun fire, the Humans held and fought each other, each force refusing to yield. They didn’t say another word all the way up until Captain Winters relieved Lieutenant Dike, sending in Lieutenant Speirs to replace him.

“Even their most incompetent officers make ours look like clowns.” Dimili muttered, bringing a soda bottle to her lips before pulling it away with a light ‘ploog’ of a suction. “I remember the stupid cocksuckers they had commanding us during the early moments of the war…”

Rhidi let out a choking laugh, then burst into wet giggles as she turned to Dimili. “Cocksuckers?! Such language!”

“Still fits.” Dimili said glumly. “Trying to crack Ur body armor and shields with our gaur-rail carbines… what a fucking joke it was. I lost count of the number of times my rounds ricocheted off those damn shields…”

Anfilid sniffed in memory, then exhaled out slowly as she kept watching the screen while speaking. “They refused to admit they were not effective on target. Just demanded us to keep firing and wear our targets down. I remember the first time I saw a Human rifle tear an Ur apart… made it all look so easy, while we were dying by the hundreds of thousands in the beginning. Lead, encased in steel with a penetrator, propelled by powder. Made us all look like morons.”

“Those cyborged birds decimated us in close combat as well. They knew all our secrets, all our weaknesses, and exploited us like a resource, feeding us into their machines to process into their own sustenance. For months we couldn't even recover the bodies of the dead, knowing they would end up as food slurry…” Uppil said, her voice trailing off as she, too, watched the screen. 

Imridit, knees pulled to her chest, was resting her chin on the top of her knees. “We got so few wounded back, let alone the dead. I personally asked a Human commander to get our wounded back more, or at least secure their bodies so we could take them back to their homes, to their families. I can still remember his smile when he said ‘We’ll take care of it’, then started asking me what information I knew. I told him about the slurry tanks, how the Ur recycled us… the fury in his eyes… I can still see those angry amber eyes when I sleep, sometimes.”

“I remember the days after that.” Rhidi said this time. All eyes drifted to her, and while the rest of the Kafya and Pwah in the room were line infantry, she had been a far more advanced wing of their special forces. “I was still fighting tooth and nail to get into some kind of unit while watching the recordings. Humans sprinting across torn ground to pick up and carry a wounded Kafya, or Pwah. I had never seen a race fight so hard over *dead bodies*, fighting tooth and nail against the Ur in melee as they sought their food source. Did you all see the Shamcil Outpost recording?”

Oin laughed bitterly. “Seen? I was the one who *recorded* it. I was there when Human drop troopers rained down from the sky in their landing ships, firing from the doors as they landed in order to keep us alive. The base had started with over ten thousand Kafya and Pwah, but we had been ground down to just under three thousand by the time the Humans arrived. The Ur had us hemmed up in the inner fortifications while they gathered our fallen into convenient mounds for processing. The Humans fought *on* the mounds of dead, taking the Ur to melee in order to secure our fallen, to keep them from becoming food slurry. They added their fallen to the mounds but refused to give ground, then surged forward when they had regained control of the base.”

“They ran the Ur all the way back to their main base.” Anfilid said quietly, sniffing. “A few of my friends had survived that battle and were running along with the Humans. Their pace was so fast and frantic that not even we Kafya could keep up. The Humans *ran them all down*, like animals, hunting and hounding them through the day and night. I don’t think they were aware that the Ur forces were turning the dead into food, but once that little secret was out of the bag, the Humans didn’t just kill the Ur… they…”

Rhidi reached over, scritching her fingers between the brown Kafya’s ears in order to calm her. “They made them pay, yeah. Cooked them alive with flamethrowers and incendiary bombardments from their bombers. They could have shelled them to death with their artillery, but they wanted the Ur to burn, to pay for what they had done to the ‘honorable fallen’. Using us for their slurries just may have been the worst mistake they had ever made.”

“The Humans did the same for us, in the same kind of way.” Marides said, setting down her bottle of RC cola. “One of our kings had fallen during the ending stages of the war, leading from the front while many others led from behind. The Humans had given him the nickname ‘Ankle Biter’ because of how vicious he was with the proper weapons, and loved him dearly. We had all been on the advance when an Ur skid round had cut through his neck, right in the gap of his armor. When he fell, and the Humans knew how hungry the Ur were, they came in their wheeled vehicles, roaring across the ground with their growling engines.”

Oin smiled to herself, leaning back against Rhidi’s bed nook. “For Ankle Biter and the Dying Court.”

Marides smiled at the screen. “Yes, that is what they bellowed when they arrived. The Ur were so hungry that they were advancing just to try and knab our fall bodies, or drag away the still bleeding wounded. Humans wouldn’t let them. I still remember a female Human medic still trying to bring Ankle Biter back to life, pumping on his chest as four riflemen crouched around his body, refusing to retreat even as the Ur got close enough to swing their blades at them. There is a great statue of that medic kneeling beside Ankle Biter in the grand courtyard of the Dying Court, while those riflemen bleed from their wounds. I got to see it once, it’s quite moving…”

The tempo of the episode picked up as the battle peaked, the room filled with the scattered reports of submachine guns, rifles, and explosions. They all watched quietly, eating their snacks, drinking their drinks, until the episode wound down into the next. 

Rhidi watched on with the others as the war seemed to be winding down, one last patrol before going back. Jackson, a young Human warrior was killed by his own grenade, over eager to enter the building and take prisoners. They were all quiet as he died, knowing the character and all he had done, the tragedy of dying by your own hand not lost on them. 

The rest of the episode was more demure, the music somber as it showed Easy Company and the Humans that survived their trials… leaving their active war. They gained commissions, scooped up rations, or just hopped up into a vehicle, leaving the war torn front for time away.

“Reminds me of the war.” Rhidi said with a sad smile. “All the noise, all the chaos… and then one day, it was all over. Planets had been torn apart, entire peoples destroyed down to their histories, cities ravaged, then one day it was just quiet.”

Oin nodded. “The rebuilding began, Humans gained their major seat on the stage of the stars, things repaired and were began anew.”

“And now here we are, heading off to do the whole thing all over again.” Enflia said with a soft laugh. “Tracing skip lines across the void in order to take rifle and blade to another creature born from dust. It really does make you wonder how the Humans can do it, you know? How they can keep grinding along, turning enemies underfoot like mud while pulling their friends up from the depths… I’ve never seen anything like them, really.”",2,1750269966.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

“Miss La?” A muffled voice called out through the door. “It’s Tyllia? Tyllia Rhidi.”

Aum-La looked around in a panic; She was wearing only her underwear, having been preparing to take a shower when she was done with her chapter.

“Shit!” She spat out, quickly setting down her mug of coffee and sprinting towards her closet, throwing her data-slate against her large couch.

“Miss La?” Tyllia called out, knocking once again on the door. “Are you in there? The little robot said it dropped off a coffee like, ten minutes ago.”

“Shit shit shit *shit*.” Aum-La fussed as she pulled on a pair of sweatpants and a tank top, wrestling *herselves* into place while trudging towards the door.

She hit the door release and it opened up, swinging outwards enough for Miss La to poke her head around and see Tyllia. 

“Tyllia!” Aum-La nearly shouted, her free hand still tugging on her sweat pants and trying to get the tail-band into place. “What are you doing here? We have class tomorrow.”

Now that she got a good look at the yellow Kafya, she looked quite distraught, and had obviously been crying. 

Aum-La opened her door a little more, now concerned. “Are you okay, Tyllia? Did something happen?”

“I c-can’t find my s-sister!” Tyllia stammered out, her eyes already threatening to spill forth tears once again.

*Perfect*. Aum-La thought to herself, pleased, as she opened the door fully and ushered the Kafya inside. “Well hold on now, there haven’t been any deaths reported. It may just be a clerical error. Here, have a seat.”

Tyllia sniffed and padded her way inside, apparently having gone barefoot around the station. She sat down on the couch as Aum-La came around the other side, sitting down heavily on the already indented cushion.

Tyllia sniffed again, then tilted her head as she spied Aum-La’s data-slate. “What’s… to love the-”

“Nothing!” Aum-La snapped, slapping the data-slate towards her bed.

Both the women watched the data-slate cartwheel across the thick comforters and thud against the opposite wall, thumping down onto the thick carpet.

Tyllia’s ears were fully perked in alarm now, her lilac eyes wide as she slowly traversed her eyes to the large female Skalathir beside her. Aum-La cleared her throat, then took a more *teachery* pose from beside the Kafya.

“You said you were having problems finding your sister?” Aum-La asked, trying to recover her usual voice despite the panic still gripping her.

Tyllia nodded, holding up her newer data-slate. “Yeah, see? It says she can’t be found.”

Aum-La had to pretend to not understand why Rhidi’s name was not there; She knew *why* the Kafya wasn’t there, but she had to play her part. Aum-La hummed and tapped at her nose as she thought, then held out her hand for Tyllia’s data-slate.

Tyllia handed it over, then scootched a little closer to Aum-La as the larger woman started tapping at the screen.

“I have to wonder if she… I mean she surely didn’t.” Aum-La said, still trying to engage the role of the equally confused non-Human.

Tyllia took the bait like a starving fish, placing her hands on the larger woman’s forearm. “Surely didn’t what?!”

“Well…” Aum-La said, masking her pleased smile into a pained grimace. “She *is* serving the Humans now-”

Tyllia tapped her pawed palms against Aum-La’s forearm. “Miss La, that isn’t true at all! She’s just learning how they soldier, mama told me so!”

“... You call her mama?” Aum-La asked, distracted by the common phrase that was apparently shared between Humans and Kafya.

Tyllia nodded. “*Carma*, you know… mama?”

“... Sure.” Aum-La replied, and returned to the previous question. “I’m not sure what your mother has told you, but I am fairly certain Rhidi took up a chain of duty during a ceremony, it was pretty big news all over their planet.”

Tyllia now looked a little panicked, gripping at Aum-Las arm. “No! No that… that can’t be right! The Elder Councils assured us that all the Kafya would come home very soon!”

“No, Tyllia, I’m afraid that is not the case at all.” Aum-La mused, then entered in the identification pre-letter that Rhidi gained after she submitted genetic material. “Ah, see, she gave her ovum to the Humans for safekeeping in their medical catacombs. Remember when we discussed those?”

Tyllia was staring at the data-slate with eyes so wide, Aum-La was afraid the poor yellow Kafya was having a stroke.

“But…” Tyllia whispered, taking back her data-slate. “But you said… you said only Humans and Drafritti get to… get to use the catacombs.”

Aum-La wrapped a large, blue scaled arm around Tyllia’s shoulders. “Yes, but I also mentioned that Humans treat those who serve with them *like* Humans. If Rhidi took up a chain of duty, they now consider her Human, and she has rights to the medical catacombs.”

“She’s gone.” Tyllia whispered again, looking up at Aum-La as fresh tears leaked down her furry cheeks. “She left on some ship like… a few days

 ago.”

Aum-La knew full damn well Rhidi was on The Wild Hunt, and even knew they had left on their first skip only a few hours ago. Still, she had to act as surprised as Tyllia was to the information, peering down at the data-slate.

“So soon? I thought she would have had more time off after training, must be something happening I suppose.” Aum-La said, then pulled the Kafya tighter to her side. “Now don’t fret too much. Whatever happens, their ships always come back here to refuel and get supplies. All you have to do is stay here on this station during your courses, and I’d be willing to bet she’ll be back here in a few months.”

Tyllia sniffed again while rubbing at her face, so Aum-La rolled her eyes and let out a sigh. “*If* you would like, I can see about you going into the staff communications suite and letting you send a message to her. We get to use the longer range communication arrays. Would you like that?”

“Yes, please.” Tyllia muttered, still rubbing at her eyes. She was quiet for a few more minutes, then gave another sniff before looking up at Aum-La. “Mama is going to be so mad…”

Aum-La smiled, though there was an odd glint to her eye. “Oh hush now, I’m sure she will understand.”

—

Tyllia didn’t leave Aum-La’s quarters until a full hour later, requiring a bit of *cheering up* before being sent on her way. This was mostly just Aum-La sitting beside her as they watched odd little Human recordings on her data-slate, but the Kafya finally got tired enough to sleep.

With Tyllia sent away, Aum-La could finally go and fetch her data-slate from where it landed on the carpet. She let out a tired sigh and undid her tail-band, then kicked away the sweat pants and once again found herself in her underwear. She looked down at her data-slate, then the time, and clicked her teeth in annoyance.

“Why bother. Mood is ruined anyway…”

Aum-La took off her tank top, shimmied down her underwear, then kicked them onto her sweatpants as she went into the shower. She washed away the day, applied all her scale lotions, then thumped grumpily into bed, not bothering to put on any clothes.

She thought back to the story, her eyelids heavy with sleep; The male protagonist was a blacksmith. She knew Humans worked with metal, but this was an “old” style of blacksmithing that mimicked her own, pounding steel with hammer against anvil to shape it.

Aum-La closed her eyes, trying to imagine the sound of a foreign anvil ringing, and how it would sound against her own… then opened them again as her alarm went off.

“Come on…” Aum-La groaned, growling as she slapped her hand around the pile of blankets that her data-slate was resting within. “It’s not fair anymore…”

Aum-La had not had a proper dream in a long, long time. These nights of closing her eyes and then waking the next moment were draining on her mind, as well as waking up curled around her pillows or extra blankets.

She groaned as she finally found her data-slate, turned off the alarm, then rose up onto her hands and knees. She wobbled back and forth in her exhausted, pre-waking up state, then slugged back down onto her blankets with a whining groan.

It took a bit more effort, but after an hour of laying on the blankets and ruminating over her students, Aum-La found the will to rise once again. She didn’t feel like dressing up much for this class, instead slipping on a pair of printless underwear, a pair of functional joggers with plenty of pockets, and a long-sleeve thermal shirt.

Before she had arrived at the door, the multi-wheeled delivery drone was already waiting for her with the order she placed back in her quarters.

“Wooow.” It said, turning around fully to look at Aum-La. “You look like shit! You know you need sleep, right?”

Aum-La glared down at the delivery drone, grumbling in her throat before ‘tsking’ her teeth again. “Very acute of you. You got my coffees?”

“Yes, yes, all three of them.” The delivery drone sighed out, opening its warming bay. “Either you need to go to bed earlier, or stop reading so much.”

Aum-La narrowed her eyes while reaching down to take one of the cups. “How do you know I read?”

“Are you kidding me?” The delivery drone replied, handing her the second coffee. “Single Skalathir woman on a space station full of Human men, who *doesn’t* interact with them, and is constantly chewing through bandwidth on her data-slate? We all know you’re reading. Only question is what…”

Aum-La scowled at the delivery drone as she took her third coffee, then glowered at her door. “Mind your own business.”

“I will if you get some sleep!” The delivery drone shouted with a jab of its delivery arm. “Put down the books and pick up a pillow, woman!”

“Buzz off.” Aum-La muttered as she opened her door and stepped through.

The delivery drone let out a digital raspberry, then sped down the hallway with a whine of its motor and rubber wheels.

Aum-La sank down into her chair, drained the first coffee in one long go, then tossed the cup into a slot on her desk. The trash chute was partially vacuum powered, sucking down the cup to be recycled.

“What should we talk about this time…” Aum-La sighed out to noone, pulling up her data-slate and scrolling through her lesson plans. She scrolled for a little while, passing all the usual topics until she came to one in particular. “Ah… mastery of the macabre. This should be a good one.”

Aum-La began loading all the videos and pictures onto the Qua-quid display, and had just finished up the last of the uploads when her students began to arrive. Tyllia still seemed a bit glum around the eyes, but Aum-La couldn’t help but notice a subtle interaction between her and a blue Kafya.

A male blue Kafya, seeing Tyllia obviously upset, had reached into the pocket of his brand new sweatpants and pulled out a small handkerchief. He offered it to Tyllia…

… But Tyllia shrank away from him, giving the blue Kafya a look as if he was *insane* to even offer it to her. The male blue Kafya seemed to shrink in on himself, scurrying away to a seat further down the table, then pulled the hood of his hoodie over his head. Aum-La raised a scaled brow ridge as the blue Kafya pulled the drawstrings tight, sucking the hood around his face in embarrassment while Tyllia seemed to pretend the blue Kafya did not exist.

“... Wow. Alright.” Aum-La chuckled to herself. “Room to improve then…”

When all the students were seated, Aum-La approached the room with her favorite opener.

“So.” Aum-La said, gesturing with her hands to the students before her. “Who here has played with a dead body?”

A female Pwah in the front of the class looked aghast, her eyes wide with fear. “Huh?! P… Played with a dead body?!”

All a part of the plan, the other students laughed nervously or from the absurdity of the question. There was some light chatter, but it quieted down when Aum-La raised her right hand a few inches.

“Yes.” Aum-La mused, slowly stepping across her little half circle of stage. “Playing with the bodies of the dead. Today we are going to go over the macabre nature of Humanity, their dual fascination with both life, and *death*.”

The room’s mirth dried up like a desert sun hitting a puddle, though the Drafritti leaned back in their chairs, waiting for the others to learn what they already knew.

“We discussed how Humans will go above and beyond the call of preserving life, whether that is escorting a spider out of their domicile, or hunting around a cleared planet for any surviving life.” Aum-La began, turning on her Qua-quid screen to display a picture of a female Human dressed in gothic attire. “Now we shall discuss their fascination with *death*.”

The classroom was dead quiet now, and Aum-La smirked to herself as she pulled up an image of ancient Human art pieces.

“Humans, for as long as any of us can figure, have been obsessed with death. They gave death a *name*, calling it The Pale Death, the Grim Reaper, and the Lead Valkyrie.” Aum-La intoned, pointing to the figures on the display; A pale, sickly man riding a white horse was staring forlornly at a dying tree, a skeleton in a black robe holding a scythe stared gazelessly at the students, while a woman with wings and adorned with broken armor gripped two fallen warriors by their plate carriers. “We have no name for death, we simply know it as *dying*. Not even we Skalathir or the poetic Pwah ever bothered to *personify* death, let alone give it any more attention than the process of life ending. Even now there are those in the IDC that still argue about the existence of souls, an argument that will likely continue until all of our bones have turned to stone.”

The Qua-quid screen began cycling through more art as Aum-La continued to speak.

“Humans may respect life, but they are *fascinated* by death. This fascination can even edge into contempt, with some Humans becoming so bathed in death that they begin to look at it with humor, or with such disregard that they can ignore even the most horrifying things around them.” Aum-La said, pulling up images of the Pactless war by tapping her fingers on the thumbpad of the same hand. Pictures of Humans spelling out warnings to the Pactless with the dead bodies of their kind came forth, as well as Pactless who were butchered in rites such as the blood eagle, or crucified upside down. “No one is really sure why Humans can do such things, actions that would turn the stomach of nearly every race known to the IDC and our slice of this galaxy, but many believe it begins in their casual acceptance and personification of death.”

More images came on screen, displays of skulls, bones, museum pieces, religious artifacts, and even mundane things such as Humans hanging the skulls of their hunted animals on the wall, or decorating shelves with the skulls of bovines. The pictures slowly slid along to show many festivals that were occupied with death; Samhain, Totensonntag, Día de Muertos, Halloween, and Obon. Catacombs filled to the brim with bones of the dead, religious icons adorned in gold and posed in positions of prayer, and even the reliquaries that contained the bodies of the “incorruptible”.

“Even now, at the current time, Humans are still fascinated by death. If you were to go down, right now, and visit a Human military graveyard, you would hear the horns of easing in the air, the smell of incense burning, and the sound of the wind cutting through their grave groves. If you were to enter a Human armory, you will find artifacts from the dead, taken and put on display; Torn and destroyed armor, helmets dented by the final blow to their bearer, all are put on display and remembered. Those of the Ashen Templar order pray with beads made of bone, followers of the Odinic Shieldwall paint black bars across their eyes with the ash of yew trees before they go into battle, and Buudhists paint their faces white before they engage in the aspects of war, mimicking the skull that lays underneath their flesh.” Aum-La said, lacing her fingers together near her chest. “This all may seem romantic to some of you, but this is merely a single facet of Humans. On the other side of this morbid coin is the Human fascination with *active* death, such as killing. For hundreds of years, Humans have told stories of killers, monsters, cravens in the night that stalked and murdered through the trees. Theatre productions have actors portraying themselves being murdered, killed, or committing suicide.”

Aum-La always enjoyed this part, tapping along the palm of her hand with her fingers; Across the screen loomed Jason, the hockey-masked killer of fiction, stalking after a pair of oddly under-dressed female Humans. She let the entire video play, pausing only after the students began to scream as Jason butchered the two women with his machete.

“Scary, isn’t it?” Aum-La asked, smiling to herself as she looked around at the horrified faces of her students.

The Drafritti weren’t nearly as scared, however, as they had seen their fair share of slasher flicks.

A Kojynn female stood, holding out her four hands towards the screen. “How could they allow that?! He killed them both! Where… where are the security forces? The lawmen?!”

“Are these kinds of Humans *down* there?!” A male Pwah shouted as he, too, stood. “How can we even be safe on this station with monsters like that running around?!”

Aum-La giggled to herself, which unnerved every student in the room besides the Drafritti.

“It is *fake*.” Aum-La said as she let out a gleeful laugh, tapping along her palm again to pull up a recording of them putting the actor in makeup. “This entire scene? Recorded on digital media with a mixture of practical and digital effects.”

The female Kojynn sat down in shock, thumping down into her chair with a skittering of the legs, while the male Pwah still stood.

“This… this is a theatrical… villain?” He asked, staring wide eyed at Jason’s actor swinging his fake machete.

Aum-La nodded. “Kind of takes the cake away from the Pwah drama houses, doesn’t it?”

“It’s… it is *grotesque*!” The Pwah shouted.

Aum-La laughed again, setting the videos to slowly cycle. “It is what Humans see as *scary*. Twenty Eight Days Later, Nosferatu, Silence Of The Lambs, Jaws, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Event Horizon, The Shining, The Fly, Humans have been normalizing themselves to any and all threats that may present themselves. It takes a *lot* to scare a Human, especially ones born after the war against the Pactless. They’ve lived or *watched* horrors that we could only dream of, and it was their unflappable edge on death that allowed them to secure our victory against the Ur.”

Aum-La pulled up one movie in particular, playing a scene where a massive metal, robotic foot crushes a Human skull. The focus then travels up to the leg to show a robotic Humanoid holding a large rifle, looking about a battlefield as explosions plume in the background.

The effect was instant amongst her students; Confusion, horror, as well as many furrowed brows that instantly made the connection.

The Drafritti were instead talking in their silent language about which Terminator was the best, with many agreeing that Aum-La had chosen wisely.

More pulse rifle fire filled the room through the sound emitters of the screen, a great metal machine trundling forward as Humans ran *towards* the threat, firing away with their own pulse rifles and other such weapons. Humans screamed and died, flying machines rained hell down from above, while other Humans fired rockets from ramshackle vehicles.

The machines advanced in their gleaming metal bodies, while Humanity fought all the while.

“To some of you, this may look quite familiar!” Aum-La called out with a smile, gesturing at the Qua-quid screen with a sway of her tail. “But what if I told you this recording, or ‘flick’ as the Humans call them, was produced and released *before* the Pactless ever invaded their planet? Made before we ever found them and asked them to join us in the war against the Ur? What if I told you that they had not one, or two, but *dozens* of different flicks made about beings from beyond their skies invading their planet?”

A Lilgarn female slowly held up her hand, then nodded her head when Aum-La pointed to her. “Are… are Humansss… seersss?

“Not from what we can tell, no.” Aum-La replied. “They are just *extremely* forward thinking. So, what do you get when you find a race of the Stars that has not only been desensitising itself to gore, trauma, and the horrors of war, coming off the backend of an alien invasion, and instilled with hundreds of years, if not thousands of years, of fascination with life and death?”

Very slowly, a male Lilgaran hand rose into the air.

“Yes?” Aum-La asked, pointing to the hand.

The Lilgara tried to not flare his hood out of fear, and swallowed thickly before uttering a single word.

“... Monstersss?” He said, more in question than statement.

Aum-La grinned, her teeth gleaming from the glow of the Qua-quid screen. “Perhaps. Does anyone know the direct quote from the UAA General of the Army when he was shown recordings of the Ur?”

A white female Kafya silently whispered “*Oh*!” before raising her hand, sitting by herself on the opposite side of the classroom, away from the other Kafya.

“Yes, Lirya?” Aum-La called out, pointing to the isolated Kafya; She still had no idea why the others would not sit near her, as she was currently surrounded by Pwah and Lilgara.

“He um…” Lirya said, faltering for a moment before casting a worried side glance at the other Kafya on the other side of the classroom. “He said ‘Oh, we’ve seen this one before’! I never really understood what he meant, and thought he was talking about the Pactless… but I guess he meant these flicks!”

Aum-La smiled at her, then side-eyed the other Kafya as she replied. “Very good Lirya. Yes, they took to the war with humor. Many soldiers even made fun of the oncoming battles against the Ur and named their Brigades after characters from the movie series. While we went into combat shaken, the Humans were *un*shakeable. The Ur had gained considerable advantages over our forces by exploiting our fear of death. The Humans, already so unafraid of death from their own cultures, provided a mental shock to the Ur that allowed us all to recover and assist them in the war.

They started talking, drank a lot and had sex. 9 months later, my dad found me on the border of Darkmoon Pack, with a note attached to me. He brought me up and 2 years later, he met.....","# Chapter1 

Hurry up, Alessandra!"" I heard someone yell from downstairs. I rolled my eyes before pulling my suitcase from my bed. ""I'm coming! Geez, have some patience woman!"" I screamed back. Gosh, I hated her! Her being my step-mum. Yep, my step-mum. It's kinda unusual for a werewolf to have step-parents, you're only meant to have ONE soulmate. Basically, my mother and my father, two beautiful people, met one night in a club. They started talking, drank a lot and had sex. 9 months later, my dad found me on the border of Darkmoon Pack, with a note attached to me. He brought me up and 2 years later, he met his mate, Hattie. She hated me from the beginning but then a year after, she had my sister. A few years after that, my brothers came. I was basically the little stain on a perfect shirt. Basically, I was the blacksheep. Also didn't help that my dad favoured me the most. Well, I understand that, I mean look at me .I started tugging my suitcase down the stairs, not even bothering to carry it down. ""That's all your bringing?"" Hattie asked, her pretty face twisted into an ugly grimace. Her brown hair was pulled into a neat bun and her dress hugged her figure. Her tanned face was also covered in a lot of makeup. Yes, unlike you, all I need is a few pair of clothes, clean underwear and my toothbrush and hairbrush."" I smiled at her sarcastically, inclining my head to the right. Before she could reply, Austin came bouncing along, a duffle bag in his hands. ""Yo bitch, are you coming or not?"" Hattie instantly shut her mouth and smiled a sickly sweet smile at him. He was the alpha's son, that's why. She actually hated him.

""Of course jerk, I'm kinda having a heart-to-heart moment with my mother!"" I said mockingly, and laughed along with him. He hated her too.

""Yeah yeah. You're coming with me and Liam aren't you?"" He asked, a cute pout on his lips. And if you're wondering, he's gay and one of my best friends.

""Liam and I. And yep."" I smiled at him before grabbing his hand and dragging him away. ""See ya soon Hattie!""

""Oh, I'm so excited! I heard that Prince Cayden is a hottie!"" He squealed as we walked over to Liam's jeep.

""All I heard was hottie and I hope it was about me."" Liam said with a straight face, leaning against the driver's door.

""Of course, dear."" Austin said, patting his cheek.

I smiled at them as I watched them interact. They looked like polar opposites, Austin always smiling, whilst Liam always brooded; they were perfect for each other. That's what I thought as well as the moon goddess. Great minds think alike!

Liam, Austin and I had always been the three musketeers, always playing and fighting together. They always had some kind of chemistry between them, and then when Austin turned 17, the age you find your mate, he found out it was Liam. Obviously, he hid it from him, as then Liam was quite the ladies man. During the few months till Liam's birthday, they started drifting apart until Austin blurted out his secret. Long story short, they fought and are now 4 years strong because of yours truly. ME!

If you hadn't guessed yet, Liam is the Beta, but I'm still stronger than both of them!

""Oi, Alessandra, stop daydreaming and get into the car!"" Liam snapped, pulling me out of my thoughts, to realise that the two men were already in the car.

""Hey, I called shotgun!"" I whined, when I saw Austin in my seat.

""I'm his mate darling, I'm always first!"" He winked at me and I playfully glared at him whilst I clambered into the back.

As I pulled in my seatbelt, I noticed all the other cars also leaving. ""Hey, wake me up when we get there."" I closed my eyes and rested my head on the window when I heard Liam agree.

I had a long training yesterday, and I only got an hour sleep.

""Off we go the ball!"" Was the last thing I heard before I drifted into sleep.

**Chapter2**

""Get the fuck up, lazy bitch!"" I screamed, shooting straight up. My hand went straight forward, hitting someone's nose. Hard.

""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!?"" I screamed whilst Austin shrieked out, blood squirting out from his nose. ""Shut up!"" I shouted at Liam as he started chuckling. A few moments later, all the annoyance washed out off me and I was joining in with Liam laughing at Austins' ... misfortune.

""LIAM! You're meant to help me! You're my mate! Punch her ugly face! Beat the crap out of her!"" Austin whined.

""I would, but it's Alessandra babe, our best friend and a girl who's stronger than both of us put together! And plus, I don't wanna end up like you."" Liam chuckled out. ""But here baby. You'll heal in a minute."" He handed his mate some tissues, pressing them onto his bleeding nose.

""Let's go."" I shouted out, ready to get out of the stuffy backseat of Liam's crappy jeep.

""No, I can't go now, I'm still bleeding. I'm the alpha's son, I can't just go in with blood dripping from my nose. And from a girl too!"" Austin whined, his eyes widening when he realised what he said. Too late, I was already pouncing on him. Not the sexual one.

""What's wrong with being hit by a girl? Huh? You're jealous, of all of this."" My legs were on each side of his hips, my arms around his neck. When I said those last words, I gestured to my body, not the best move, because he grabbed my arms and pinned them down. With his bloody hands. I pouted before slamming my head forward, connecting it to his nose.

Oh god the pain! Whose nose is that hard? Oh shit, well that backfired. Now we were both in pain, me with a bruising forehead and him with, probably, a broken nose.

""Seriously guys? In my baby?"" Liam said from outside. ""Just hurry up guys, our parents are gonna be mad.""

""Since when do you give a shit about what our parents think?"" I snorted as I walked out of the jeep's door, high-fiving Austin and giggling. Liam's glare shut me up.

""We are at the castle. Act like adults for once guys!"" Liam snapped, throwing our bags at us.

That's when I had an oh yeah moment! I looked around and literally drooled at the sight of the MASSIVE castle in front of me. Oh my gosh, if Prince Cayden doesn't find his mate today, I'll volunteer as tribute! I mean, look at this place! How big were the training grounds?!

""I'm sorry baby,"" Austin said, wrapping his arms around Liam's waist, a sum parties look in his face,"" You can punish me tonight."" He winked at Liam before pulling out of his embrace and laughing like a mad man.

""Oh shit. Liam, whilst I was asleep, did you let Austin drink coffee?"" I asked him, watching as Austin twirled around in circles.

""Only a sip!"" Liam defended himself, throwing his arms up.

""Look what you did! You created a monster!"" I hissed at him, catching Austin's arm before he fell into a group of passing kids.

""Well technically... his parents did."" He smirked in amusement. I snorted.

""ALESSANDRA THERE  YOU ARE!"" I winced at the sound of my half-sister, Sophia.

""And speaking of monsters..."" I trailed off and faced Sophia with a fake smile. ""Hello, dear sister. I haven't seen you in so long. How was Jeremy's dick?"" I asked, holding in my laughter. Austin didn't have much luck, bursting into laughter and leaning onto my shoulder. Oh well, he was high in caffeine.

Jeremy Ryans was my sister's... how do you put this? Flavour of the month. Well, in her case, flavour of the week.

""You were meant to be inside 10 minutes ago! Mother and Father sent me to look for you, shame you're here. Alive."" She smiled sarcastically before turning to Liam, who was now holding Austin in a piggybank, ""What's wrong with him?"" She was talking about Austin who now had drool dripping down his jaw and onto Liam's shoulder.

""He had coffee. Anyways, why don't you waddle back and maybe go and find some guards to fuck."" I flipped her the bird and watched as she walked away, right after flicking her long, silky hair into my face.

I should've cut the entire thing off 7 years ago. Ah, I still remember that day. Waking up to her screeching and seeing her jaggedly hair. Those good days, (mentally wipes away a tear).

""I hate her."" I sighed, shaking my head.

""We all know that, let's just get my crazy mate inside without anyone noticing!"" Liam said.

""Well my parents are looking for me, so just find your room, and put him down. Quietly!"" I spoke grinning at the look on his face. ""Bye!"" I waved and ran off, carrying my suitcase above my head. Oh great, now I probably looked like the mad person.

I slowed down when I realised that there were a lot of other people here, some of them staring at me. I smiled sheepishly, before putting my suitcase down and looking around.

I didn't really recognise anyone, but then again, most alphas were probably all inside, or checking out the training grounds. Hmmm.... remind me to do that.

""JAYDEN!"" I shrieked my brother's name out when I saw him. Poor guy jumped and looked around, kinda like a bug.

""Alice? Finally! Hurry the fuck up, Alpha Brian is showing off to the other alphas!"" He said, grabbing my bag and dragging me along.

Why is everyone man-handling me?

All the alphas do this. They just show off their fighters, their women and their money, trying to see if they're better. And - ohhhh, these floors are so white! How are they so clean? And look at that chandelier! It looks fricking gold and crystal! And these windows! They're huge! Man, when we leave, I'm definitely gonna take something back as a souvenir! Heeheehee.

""Ah, here is Alessandra Jones, one of my strongest fighters."" Huh? We were here already? Anywho...

""Hello."" I smiled at the alpha standing opposite us. Who was he again?

""Hmmm, I've heard of you."" His ugly, beady eyes examined me head to toe. Oh great, another judgy alpha.

This is gonna be a long week! And the ball is only tomorrow night!

**Chapter3**

""So you're from Mooncreek Pack?"" I asked some girls, wolfing down my breakfast. Get it? Wolfing down! Oh, I'm so funny!

Anyways, it was the next morning and guess who I shared a room with. Sophia. Yep, instead of having my own room, with only one bed, with lots of pillows of course, my own T.V and my own bathroom, finally, I walked straight into the room my dad had told me to, and boy were there a lot of rooms, to see her stuff already packed away into the wardrobes. Yep, I still remember the arguments we had.

Flashback//

""What the fuck are you doing here?"" I shrieked.

""We're sharing, duh!"" She replied, a cocky smile on those ugly lips of hers.

""No we're not. Go and find some guy to share a room with, or go and share with Elena!"" I screamed back, trying to stuff all her things back into her bag.

""No, get off!"" She shrieked.

Flashback over//

Ah, that carried on for a while until m- our dad came in. He shouted at us, Sophia fake cried, he was on her side, he shouted at me, Sophia took up all of the space, I had to shower using our neighbour's bathroom. And now, I'm ignoring my dad until he apologises. I know, very mature.

""Yes, and you're from Darkmoon, aren't you?"" One of the girls asked, a disgusted look on her face. I rolled my eyes, I should've sat down next to those kids! At least they were colouring on paper instead of their faces!

Wait a moment. Why were a bunch of kids awake earlier than most of the people in here? Meh, they were probably going playing.

""Yep. Shit, sorry."" I laughed when I accidentally spat some of my food out, onto a girl's face.

""We have to go now."" They smiled at me, obviously a fake one, and literally ran away.

Meh, I shrugged my shoulders before carrying on, stuffing my face with eggs, bacon, sausages and pancakes. Oh, yeah, I was in the dining hall. A big, big, big hall full of tables. And others werewolves of course.

Anyways, I was gonna go exploring! I couldn't be bothered to wait for Liam and Austin, they were probably still in bed. It is 5am.

Usually I would still be asleep, but damn was Sophia loud! She was in the shower for a long time, and then she was blow-drying her hair, and then she was talking to Elena for 2 hours. On the fucking phone! I mean, come on! You could just talk in person! Away from our room.

She went to bed at 2, all in her pink nightgown and sleeping mask. I was just falling asleep, when I heard drunk people laughing, and if you've never heard or seen a drunk person, they're loud. Curse my super-hearing! Anyways, I basically didn't go to sleep at all. I would've just stayed in bed, but then I smelt bacon. That got me up and running!

""Phew!"" I breathed out, placing my hands on my full stomach. I'm lucky I do a lot of training, or else I'd be huge! Which is abnormal for a werewolf.

I mean seriously! Every werewolf I've met has had good faces and bodies, it was the humans who were all meh, but in my opinion, everyone was perfect like they are. In their own way.

Anyways, I'll just check 'amazing breakfast' off my list and now go exploring. I'm kidding, I don't have a list. Haha.

""Duh duh duh duh duh, duh duh duh, duh, ra duh duh duh duh duh, doo doo doo."" I hummed as I walked along the empty corridors. What was that tune?

I smiled an evil smile when I saw a sign on a big, wooden door. A sign that said 'West Wing, forbidden to commoners'. Damn, this was like beauty and the beast!

To be honest, the only word I was reading was FORBIDDEN. I was also hearing a guard's voice, ""Everyone stay away from the West Wings and you'll be safe."" Well, well, well, seems like this morning keeps getting better and better. Cue evil laugh, mwahaha!

I looked behind me, saw no one there, to my sides, no one there either. And I pulled the door open. Guess what, it didn't budge. I kept on pulling, damn, how heavy was this door.

Wait a moment, this is what always happens in movies, it's not pull, it's push. And that's when I stopped pulling and instead, starting pushing. Still didn't budge.

Wait, again! I pulled a bobby pin from my pocket, hey I had all kinds of crazy shit hidden in there, and started twisting. I knelt down, putting my whole weight on the door, which by the way, still didn't move.

Just as I was gonna give up, I heard a turn of the key, and before I could move, the door opened, making me fall straight onto the floor at someone's feet.

""Who are you, and what are you doing here?"" Damn, this guy was hot. Shame, he had me pinned onto the floor, oh well, I could still feel his muscles.

""Dude, you're the one on top of me, who are you?"" I asked, not even bothering to fight back. I was admiring though.

""Well darling, I'm Cayden. Prince Cayden. Your turn love!"" He said.

Three things registered into my head, 1) a hot prince was straddling me, 2) was he British? And 3) the tune I was humming was from Octonauts.

**Chapter4**

""What are you stupid or something? Who the fuck are you?"" He asked, his grip tightening on my neck.

I opened my mouth to speak but just ended up spluttering, I gestured to his hands desperately and gasped when he did. ""Holy shit! Oh, right, I'm Alessandra Jones from Darkmoon."" I said, right before flipping us over so my hands held him down.

Surprise flitted into his eyes before he spoke, ""I've heard of you, the amazing warrior, one of the strongest."" He spoke, a smirk on hid face.

""Really? I know I'm amazing, but even a prince knows me! Wow!"" I spoke, grinning.

""And arrogant too."" He spoke, chuckling a bit. ""You wanna get off of me?""

""Oh yeah."" I laughed before I quickly got up, giving him my hand.

""I'm sure all visitors were told not to come in the West Wing, why are you here?"" He asked.

""Technically, we're still by the door, and I'm not the one for rules."" I smirked, as he laughed.

""Well then, since you're already in here, you want a tour?"" I nodded eagerly. ""Well guess what, you aren't getting one. I have lots to do, nice to meet you Alexandra, see you at the ball.""

My mouth fell open when he pushed me out and slammed the door in my face. ""It's Alessandra!"" I screamed out, sighing heavily when I heard him laugh.

Stupid cocky prince. Stop eating fatty."" Austin hissed at me, elbowing me on my side.

We were at the ball now, the mated werewolves dancing whilst the unmated just stood on the sidelines, watching. All alone.

Well Austin and Liam were the exceptions.

""Just taste this."" I didn't wait for a reply and just shoved the food into his mouth. I didn't even know what it was, it just tasted great!

""Holy shit, this is great!"" He whispered, taking a fork and stealing my food.

""Why are you whispering?"" I laughed aloud. ""Ohhhh... thanks."" I grabbed a cocktail from Liam, quickly drinking it. Yes! It had alcohol in it!

""I love you Liam."" I smiled at him, fluttering my eyes.

""Yeah yeah. Hopefully you'll find your mate so we can get rid of you!"" Liam said, rolling his green eyes. ""The Royals will be out soon, get ready to go up."" I just nodded, turning back to the food table.

Basically, the Royals come out and they call out all the packs, and in alphabetical order, they all basically introduce themselves to the Royals. There were five of them, unless there were some secret children. There was the King, his Queen and their three children, two boys and one girl. I've already met one of five, I hope they aren't all cocky bastards.

I stood by the food table, taking and eating more whilst talking to my wonderful best friends when silence went through the hall, the Royals were here.

""Please welcome, his majesty King Herald, her majesty Queen Isabella, Princes Cayden and Dakota and Princess Robyn!"" Some guy announced and we all clapped as they walked in. And boy do I see where Cayden got his good looks.

And holy fucking shit, if I thought Cayden was hot, look at his brother! He was basically perfect! Was he a God!?

I watched as they all sat down gracefully, Prince Dakota with a stone-cold look on his face, yet I could still see that he was bored.

""ARENLIGHT PACK!""

And here we go. Let the fun begin.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

""DARKMOON PACK!""

""Shit, shit, go up!"" Everyone made space for all of us to go up, we were quite a big pack.

Austin, Liam and I went to the back, next to our families. It went from the lower statuses at the front and the highest at the back.

At the back were Austin parents, the old alpha, my family, and the warriors went down. Then in the middle were the ordinary ones and right at the front were the omegas.

""Alessandra, you have food all over your mouth!"" Hattie hissed, getting a napkin and trying to wipe it off. She was probably successful as when she pulled it away, it was covered in food.

""Hi Alice!"" Barney and Lily said, giving me quick smiles. They were Austin's parents.

I gave them quick smiles, before we lined up silently. I tiptoed and saw that they were still talking to the ordinary werewolves.

I sighed heavily. This was gonna take a long time.

""Alessandra, are you mad at me?"" My dad whispered in my ear.

I didn't turn to face him but I did reply. ""Yes.""

""Is it because I took Sophia's side?"" He asked me. Me not replying gave him the answer."" Are you serious? Why are you acting like a child?""

""I'm mad at you."" Was the only thing I said back, moving forwards in the line.

""No, I'm mad at you, you can't even get along with your sister. I'm very disappointed in you, Alessandra."" He answered, and he ignored me.

It was silence between us, but I could feel Austin and Liam giving me sideways glances.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

""Hello your majesty."" I smiled at him, shaking his hand.

A shocked look went on his face before he returned my smile and shook my hands. ""It's nice to meet you to Alessandra, I've heard lots about you. Good things, don't worry."" He laughed joyfully. Oh he reminded me of Santa, just without the beard and big belly.

""Hello, impolite, cocky dickhead."" I smiled at Prince Cayden.

""Alessandra!"" My dad and Hattie hissed, angry looks on their faces.

""Hello to you too, arrogant rule breaking bitch."" He laughed loudly, kissing the back of my hand softly and winking at me.

""Do you two know each other?"" Isabelle asked, a curious look on her face.

""Yeah, we met for a few minutes but we're already like best friends!"" I smirked, Cayden nodding along with me, his messy brown hair moving along with it.

""Yep, and if I don't find my mate, she's gonna be my mate. Princess Alexandra!"" He joked, and laughed when I glared at him. We all laughed, even though Sophia and Hattie had ugly grimaces on their faces. Jayden and Zac were flirting with the princess, whilst Austin was giving me angry looks.

I knew he was mad because I didn't tell him that I had met a Royal, especially prince Cayden. He had been fawning over him for so long.

I moved to the left to stand opposite Dakota, whilst Barney and Lily replaced my position opposite Cayden.

I looked into Dakota's brown eyes and saw them darken along with mine. Oh my god!

""Mate."" We growled at the same, the people near us freezing in shock.

I shivered as his eyes travelled down my body, my eyes travelling down his muscular, beautiful body.

Oh god! I had a beautiful mate! Someone way out of my league!

**Chapter5**

""What?""

""How is that possible?""

""Oh no!""

""You made a mistake!""

""Yes, we'll be the godfathers of beautiful children!""

Well, apart from the last comment, obviously said by Austin, they were all bad. I mean I understand my dad's anger, his daughter found her mate and Hattie and Sophia were just plain jealous. It was the Royals' reactions. Shouldn't they be happy their son found his mate? Is it because he wasn't going to be King? Was I too ugly? Why did Dakota's parents have fear in their eyes? What the fuck was happening?!

A wave of confusion and sadness washed over me as my eyes connected with Dakota's; it seemed like he too didn't want to be mates with me.

I quickly looked away, my eyes moving around the hall. A lot of people were staring at us now, already seeing that something had happened. The Royal guards moved a bit closer to us, and a good looking man came to stand by Cayden's side. He was hot, but he was nothing compared to Dakota.

Talking about Dakota, I went to face him again, to see him not there. I looked around the room wildly, trying to use my senses. My sharp eyes caught him slipping through the door. How had no one saw him?

I didn't think for a moment when I ran after him, ignoring my dad who called after me, the number 1 priority in my head was to find my mate and demand for him to tell me his problems with me.

I followed his scent - chocolate and mangoes, a weird combination, but it worked as I smelt him to my left. I went left, just to stop when I walked right into a dead end. His scent was even gone!

Okay, I know what this is, most castles have these, secret passageways leading  through the wall, I just have to find the right place to push for it to open.

I studied the wall. There was nothing out of the ordinary, so I just pushed a space, and when that didn't work, I just kept on pushing random parts of the wall. At the end I just pulled a part of a stature that was just there, but instead of opening the wall, I just broke it.

""What are you doing?"" I spurred around at the sound of my mate's voice, hiding the broken object behind my back. 

""Um.... I was looking for you."" I told him, biting my lip and looking down. Damn was his voice nice - low and husky with a tinge of an accent.

""I didn't know I was in a wall or in a statue.""  He told me, his eyes darkening as he stared down at my lips. My cheeks flushed red and I quickly released my lip.

""I thought there was some kind of passageway."" I told him, wincing when I realised how dumb that sounded.

""Well you're right, there are passageways in here, but you're just standing by a normal wall."" He told me, a quick flash of amusement flying through his eyes before it disappeared into coldness.

""I'm not here to talk about walls."" I crossed my arms across my chest, giving him a determined look, ""Why did you leave?""

""I don't want a mate."" Was his only reply, yet I felt like he was keeping something behind and from me.

""Why? Am I not right for you? Do you have another woman in your life? A man?"" I asked, my eyes tearing and my voice breaking.

His eyes softened and his stance loosened, ""I have no one in my life, and that's the way I want to keep it.""

""Why!"" I cried out, feeling a tear fall down my cheek.

He stepped closer to me until I could feel his breath in my hair. I wasn't that tall, but his head was kinda bent down. His fingers trailed down my jaw softly, wiping away the fallen tear. I leant into his touch, my eyes closing when I felt his other hand wrap around my waist. Man, I had butterflies, fireworks, bombs... everything!

""I don't want to hurt you."" He whispered in my ear, his minty breath making me shiver and his chest pressed tightly to my own. I lifted my hand and placed it on his chest, right where I could feel the thumps of his heartbeat.

He took a sharp breath and took a step back, losing all connections with my body. I instantly felt cold without his arms around me. Well, also because of the cold rush that just went by.

I opened my eyes, but instead of seeing him, I just saw an empty corridor. I looked around frantically.

How the hell does he do that? What is he, a fucking ninja?!

And great, now I was lost! Which way did I come? I looked right and left, my guts telling me to go right, but I wanted to be alone now, so I turned left, and kept on walking.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

I took a deep breath, closing my eyes and letting the wind ruffle through my hair.

I was now in some kind of tower, a very tall tower with an amazing view, that reminded of the Astronomy tower from Harry Potter. I love those books! So sad that all those good people died: Dobby, Dumbledore, Snape, Fred and so much more. But hey, at least the marauders, I'm talking about Padfoot, Prongs and Moony, not the traitor, are together at last and are probably creating havoc in heaven. If I was in Hogwarts, I'd probably be in Gryffindor, and if I can go back in time, I'll join the marauders and help them with Remus' furry problem! I'd be called.... Wolfie!

I was pulled out of my magical thoughts, when I heard someone running in here. I turned around quickly, my eyes wary and my stance strong, but quickly calmed down when I realised it was a crying girl. Her face was covered by her hands, but she was probably really pretty, judging by her amazing body! I watched as she ran straight into the corner, the darkness and shadows concealing her.

""Hey!"" I called out, mentally cursing myself when the word I spoke came out more harshly than I thought.

""Who are you!"" She cried out, her voice still thick from her crying.

I was about to tell her my name, but then I realised she was a complete stranger. She could be a bad guy for al, I know! ""My name's Joanna Kyles, I'm from Riverside Pack.""

I heard her sniff. ""Hi, I'm Clara from the Royal pack."" Okay she was telling the truth, now I feel bad about lying to her!

""What's wrong Clara?"" I asked her, staying where I was. She can come out when she wants.

""My mate hates me!"" She cried out, starting to weep once more.

""I'm sure that's not true darling. How long have you been dating?""

""That's the thing, we aren't dating! We found out that we were mates a few years ago, but he told me that he didn't want to be tied down! He takes me on dates, acts sweet, but then around people, he's such a jerk!""

""He sounds like a pompous dickhead!"" I snorted out, covering my mouth in shock when I realised I had said that out loud.

""He is."" She laughed a bit, calming down slightly.

""Why don't you come on out?"" I asked, smiling slightly. She's the first female around my age that I actually like.

It was quiet for a bit, only her sniffles were heard, but then I heard a light rustling and she was coming out. My mouth fell open when I finally caught a look of her face, and I was right! She was very beautiful! She looked like a fricking angel with her blonde hair and innocent face.

""Holy shit! You are possibly the most beautiful creature I've ever come across!"" I gasped out, pinching her cheeks. They were so soft!

""Thanks, but I'm nothing compared to you!"" She said back, wiping her face and smiling at me.

""You know, Clara, I think this is a start to a beautiful friendship!"" I told her, wrapping my arm around her shoulders.

""Yes, I think it is. Can I tell you a secret? You're probably my first friend."" She told me, her cheeks flushing.

""That's fine. Can I tell you two secrets? 1) you're my first female friend too and 2) my name isn't Joanna, it's Alessandra Jones from Darkmoon pack."" I smiled sheepishly at her.

**Late Afternoon**

***The Listing***

**I wasn’t supposed to be house-hunting. Not really.**

**I’d been couch-surfing, living on instant ramen and caffeine pills, and job-hopping through anything that paid in cash. When I typed “cheap housing LA no credit check” into the search bar, I didn’t expect an answer.**

**But then the ad loaded.**

\*\*“JEFF & GEOFF’S REAL ESTATE — WHERE OUR HOUSES ARE CHEAP, AND YOUR SCREAMS ARE OPTIONAL!”\*\****2-Story Home — $50,000 — Move-In Ready***

**I clicked. Of course I clicked.**

**The website looked like it hadn’t been updated since dial-up: scrolling text, pixelated house photos, and a logo that blinked “SOLD!” every few seconds.**

**But the photos showed a modest, clean two-story house with soft blue walls, white trim, and polished floors. No furniture. No clutter. Empty. Like it had been waiting for someone.**

**The price? Unreal. I assumed it was a scam.I filled out the form anyway. A joke. A desperate swipe at something better.**

**The next morning, a sealed envelope sat on my doorstep. No postage. No return address. Just red wax stamped with a simple “J & G.”**

**Inside was a polaroid of the house, a deed with my name already filled in, and a thick folded booklet:**

***""Most tenants survive their first week. You'll be fine.""— Geoff �***�

**I should have thrown it away.**

**I should have laughed and gone back to sleeping on an air mattress in a roachy studio apartment.**

**But I didn’t.**

**Because somehow... I believed it.**

**I drove out to the address that evening. The house was exactly as promised: quiet, blue-walled, the front porch light flickering like it was deciding whether to welcome me or not.**

**I stood at the door for a long time.**

**Then I stepped inside.**

**The air smelled like nothing at all. No dust. No mildew. No life.**

**The walls were blue. I repeated the line from the guide under my breath:**

***Blue is safe. Blue is safe. Blue is safe.***

**The door closed behind me.**

**I didn’t sleep that night. Not really.The floorboards shifted once around 3 a.m., and I swore I heard something breathing behind the walls.**

**\[Chapter 2\]** 

**Nightfall**

***The First Night***

**I didn’t bother unpacking.**

**The suitcase sat near the front door like a warning. The house didn’t feel like a home — it felt like a trap waiting to be triggered.**

**The living room had a couch, a crooked lamp, and three front-facing sealed windows with old wooden frames. I checked the locks twice. Then I pulled the curtains down.**

***“The living room is usually safe in the morning, as long as the windows are closed.”***

**I didn’t risk the light.**

**Upstairs, the bedroom was dim, quiet, almost sterile. No ceiling fan, no furniture. Just a thin mattress against one blue wall and a single plug socket that sparked slightly when I tried to charge my phone.**

**I lay down. The guide rested beside me like a loaded weapon.**

**I left the lamp on.**

**I woke up to silence — the kind of silence that felt chosen.**

**The digital clock on the floor read 2:11 AM.**

**My chest was tight. My mouth dry. The air had changed.**

**I moved my arm — or thought I did.**

**But when I looked, my left arm was hanging off the mattress... and moving on its own. Slowly curling and uncurling like it was stretching.**

**Then it pulled itself back under the blanket.**

***“Once in bed, stay there until 6 AM. Your shadow will leave your body and wander the house. If it finds you awake, pretend to sleepwalk or pass out.”***

**The doorknob turned.**

**A single, slow rotation. Then stopped.**

**The house creaked — not like settling wood. Like something heavy and soft was shifting its weight just outside my door.**

**I rolled my head to the side, let my mouth fall open. Played unconscious.**

**The shadow — mine, or something else — lingered.**

**I heard it breathe.**

**Then it moved on.**

**I stayed frozen until the clock clicked over to 6:00 AM.The light in the room seemed a little colder. The walls slightly darker.**

**Still blue — but strained.**

**I stumbled downstairs and sat on the couch, hands shaking.**

**Then I heard the scratching.**

**Not loud — a deliberate scrape against wood.**

**I turned toward the front door.**

**Outside, on the porch, sat a gray cat — blind, thin, fur matted like cobwebs. It pawed at the wooden door, claws clicking against the grain.Its head tilted unnaturally — like it was trying to listen.**

***“Felix the cat: Do not let him in. He may think you killed his owner.”***

**He paused. Sniffed.**

**Then turned his head toward the peephole. Stared directly into it, though his eyes were milk-white.**

**I backed away.**

**About thirty minutes later, I heard pecking.**

**Tap. Tap. Pause. Tap.**

**I approached the window beside the front door.**

**Perched on the sill was a small black bird, motionless except for the rhythmic flick of one wing. Its eyes glimmered like cold beads.**

**The guide's words echoed in my head:**

***“⏚⟟⍀⎅ the bird: Let him in if he taps. He belongs to ⨯⍜⎎⏃⏁⊑⍜⎍⌇⏃⋏⎅.”***

**I unlatched the top pane just enough for the bird to flutter inside. It did — without hesitation — landed on the hallway floor, blinked once, and walked deeper into the house.**

**Then it vanished. No sound. No trace.**

**I closed the window immediately.**

**The house was still blue. Still holding itself together.**

**But something had changed.Not in the house — in me.**

**I'd survived the first night.**

# [Chapter 3]

**Late Morning*****The Man Who Sees Everything***

**But I’d also been seen.**

**I didn’t remember falling asleep.**

**The light through the windows had that washed-out, unreal quality — like everything was trying too hard to be ordinary. My head was foggy. I hadn’t eaten since I arrived, but I wasn’t hungry. I wasn’t anything. Just floating.**

**I wandered into the upstairs bathroom and ran to the sink.**

**Cold water. Blue walls. Still safe.**

**I stared into the mirror for a long time.**

**Then blinked.**

**I blinked again. But the mirror didn’t.**

**For a half second — not long — my reflection remained frozen, eyes half-lidded, mouth slightly open, like it hadn’t gotten the message I’d moved on.**

**The guide practically screamed in my head:**

***“If your reflection lags, it’s not you anymore. Break it immediately. It’s better to make your roommates mad than be sucked into the other world.”***

**I hesitated.**

**I don’t know why. I wanted to believe it was just sleep-deprivation. That it hadn’t really happened.**

**I leaned closer.**

**My reflection blinked.Twice.Faster than I had.**

**I grabbed the soap dish and smashed the mirror.**

**The glass spiderwebbed, then shattered outward, as if something behind it had been pushing.**

**No sound. Just sudden cold air. The smell of old metal.**

**I backed out of the bathroom and slammed the door.**

**When I turned around, he was there.**

**Tall enough to graze the ceiling. Skin like milk stretched too thin.Eyes covered him — not just his face, but his neck, his shoulders, his hands, his chest, blinking independently in slow, uneven rhythms.**

**Each one looked tired. Or watching something else.**

***“A tall, pale figure with many eyes. Avoid eye contact.”***

**I dropped my gaze.**

**But one of the eyes — one near his clavicle — caught me.**

**And I saw it.**

**I saw myself bleeding in reverse, time folding in on itself like a dying star. I saw the moment I was born, screaming — not because I was alive, but because I already knew I’d come here. I saw myself in the basement, climbing a staircase that went nowhere.**

**The vision snapped like a stretched rubber band.**

**I collapsed to my knees, gasping, dizzy.**

**The figure tilted its head, blinked all its eyes once — a wave, like falling dominos — then walked slowly past me toward the now-dark bathroom.**

**Its footsteps made no sound.**

**I lay on the floor until I could breathe again.**

**When I finally stood, the hallway was empty.**

**But I wasn’t alone.**

**I turned toward the stairwell — and there, at the top, was me.**

**Standing in the same hoodie. Same posture. Same confused look on his face.**

**“Hey,” he said. “You good?”**

**I didn’t answer.**

**“Bathroom’s safe now. Mirror’s gone. Don’t worry about it.”**

**He smiled.**

**It was too calm. Too easy.And there was no tension behind his eyes — no fear. No memory of the many-eyed man.**

***“A doppelgänger will try to lure you into fake floors. Avoid it. If it becomes aggressive, leave the house immediately for a week.”***

**He pointed behind him — up the staircase that shouldn’t be there.**

**Third floor.**

**It appeared without a sound, like a trick of the house’s memory.The light above it was flickering.**

**“C’mon,” he said. “There’s something I wanna show you.”**

**I didn’t respond. I didn’t move.**

**He took a step toward me — casually. Like it didn’t matter what I did.**

**Then he blinked — the wrong way. Top eyelid down. Bottom eyelid up.**

**I ran.**

**I slammed the bedroom door behind me and pushed the dresser in front of it.**

**There was no lock. Just the hope that he wouldn’t bother.**

**After a moment, I heard footsteps receding.**

**But they didn’t go up the stairs.They went down.**

# [Chapter 4]

**Late Afternoon**

***They Want In***

**I didn't leave the bedroom for hours after the encounter with the doppelgänger.**

**The third floor had vanished again.The pale man hadn’t returned.**

**But the mirror — what was left of it — still bled light when I opened the bathroom door. I left it alone.**

**Around 4 PM, I sat in the living room. The windows were shut. The blinds drawn.The silence was different now — thicker, like the house was waiting for me to slip.**

**Then came the ringing.**

**A phone. But not mine. It echoed from the hallway. High-pitched, mechanical — a landline.**

**There was no phone in the house.**

**Still, the ringing pulsed steadily. Four times. Five.**

***“Ignore phone calls, texts, or emails claiming to be from us. They are not us.”***

**I didn’t move. I let it ring.**

**On the tenth ring, it stopped.**

**Not a minute later, someone knocked.**

**Three times. Then silence. Then again.**

**I approached the peephole slowly, heart pounding.**

**A man stood on the porch.**

**Mid-thirties. Short brown hair. Glasses. Wearing a UPS uniform that looked perfectly ironed — too perfect. No wrinkles. No badge number. No name tag.**

**He rocked back and forth on his heels, smiling.His eyes were slightly too far apart.**

**Then he raised his hand and waved at the peephole.**

**I stepped back. The guide rang in my skull like an alarm:**

***“If they seem wrong… don’t answer and close the blinds. They are corpses pretending to be people.”***

**I reached for the cord, hands shaking, and pulled the blinds down tight.**

**The knocking stopped.**

**I waited.**

**After five full minutes, I looked again.**

**He was gone.**

**That’s when I heard panting.**

**Soft. Friendly.**

**Outside, just beyond the door, came a soft whine.**

**I froze.**

**Another whine. Then a low, happy bark.**

**I didn’t even have to check the guide. I remembered.**

***“Max the dog: He is safe. Whether you let him in or not is your choice.”***

**My hand hovered over the deadbolt.**

**I opened it slowly.**

**A shaggy black-and-white dog sat on the porch, tail thumping against the floor.Big eyes. Tongue hanging out. Normal.**

**Utterly normal.**

**He walked in when I stepped aside. No hesitation. No sound from his paws on the wood floor. He circled the room twice, then curled up beside the couch and rested his head on his paws.**

**I shut the door again.**

**I sat down beside Max. For the first time in days, I wasn’t alone — and I wasn’t afraid of what was in the room with me.**

**He licked my hand once. Just once.**

**Then we both listened to the house breathe.**

# [Chapter 5]

**Evening**

***The Skin Between Walls***

**Max and I sat in the living room for hours.I didn’t talk. He didn’t bark.**

**Just the sound of his breathing and the low hum of the fridge in the kitchen.**

**But even that peace had a time limit.**

**At some point, Max lifted his head, ears pricked.A low growl buzzed in his throat.**

**I looked toward the hallway.**

**There was someone standing there.**

**Faceless. Blurry. Their outline smudged like a corrupted image file.They swayed slightly. Hands at their sides.**

**Another figure stood near the base of the stairs. Then a third, in the kitchen doorway.**

**None moved.**

**I stared at them for too long.**

**One of them twitched.**

***“Do not speak to or look at them. If provoked, they may remove your eyes.”***

**I turned away, slow and deliberate.**

**Max growled louder. Then whimpered.**

**When I looked back, they were gone.**

**I retreated to the bathroom. Not because I needed to go — because I needed to not be seen.**

**I knocked three times.**

**No response. I entered.**

**Still blue walls. Still cold tile. Still safe.**

**I let the tap run and watched the water swirl.**

**I stared too long.**

**Something beneath the drain shifted.**

**Not movement — more like pressure, like something too large sliding through a pipe too narrow.A long, slow grinding sound — like bone against bone.**

**The guide surfaced in my mind:**

***“Leave within five minutes. If you need more time, offer blood to the drain.”***

**I sliced a shallow line across my palm with the edge of a razor cartridge.Let three drops fall.**

**The water hissed as it swallowed them. The pressure beneath faded.**

**I shut the tap.**

**Just before I left, I looked at the mirror.**

**It reflected me perfectly.**

**But behind me…**

**A faceless shape stood near the tub, watching.**

**I didn’t turn around.**

**I left the bathroom and closed the door.**

**That’s when the walls changed.**

**I noticed it in the hallway first. The soft blue had turned... dull yellow.**

**Not painted — just tinted, like the walls themselves were sick.**

**I opened the bedroom door.**

**Yellow. Too bright.**

**The living room: yellow.**

**Only the upstairs hallway still held the faint, bruised blue.**

***“If the walls turn yellow, the floors have reversed. The lower floors are fake. Go upstairs or leave within the hour.”***

**Max followed me up without hesitation. He seemed to understand.**

**I sat on the second-floor landing, knees pulled to my chest, as the house below us pulsed like a rotten lung.**

**And then I heard the knock.**

**From inside the kitchen.**

**Not on the front door — but on the floor.**

**Three solid knocks.**

**The same rhythm the pale man made with his eyes.The same rhythm the shadow used when testing the doorknob.**

**I stood. Slowly.**

**The hallway behind me, once calm, now shimmered green around the baseboards.**

**Not fully — just hints. Like a disease spreading under the paint.**

**Max whimpered once.**

**The house was changing.**

**I had broken too many rules.**

**And I was running out of time.**

# [Chapter 6]

**Night**

***The Cost of Company***

**I shouldn’t have called them.**

**But after five nights alone with shifting walls, eye-covered giants, birds that vanish into hallways, and a dog that understands more than he should — I cracked.**

**I texted two old friends.**

**Mason — reckless, stubborn, always grinning like nothing could touch him.And Lucas — quieter, softer, the kind who made you feel safe just by being in the room.**

**They didn’t need convincing.When I said, “Please come over,” they said, “On our way.”**

**They arrived just after 7 p.m.I watched them through the peephole to be sure.**

**Normal proportions. No extra limbs. No teeth where there shouldn’t be teeth.**

**Still, I hesitated.**

**The guide whispered in my memory:**

***“If you invite someone, they must follow the rules. Or you’ll both suffer for what they do wrong.”***

**I opened the door.**

**Mason immediately raised a small paper bag. “Guess what I brought?”**

**“No,” I said.**

**“Yes,” he grinned, pulling out a bottle of cheap whiskey. “A housewarming. I don’t care what your haunted pamphlet says.”**

**Lucas rolled his eyes and stepped inside, already scanning the blue walls. “It’s... clean. Too clean.”**

**Mason popped the cap, took a swig, and held it out to me.**

**“Seriously, you look like a ghost. One drink won’t kill you.”**

**“I’m not drinking anything in this house,” I said.**

**Mason took another swig. “More for me.”**

**I begged them to read the guide. Mason skimmed it. Lucas actually read most of it.They laughed at the snack cabinet. Scoffed at the shadows.**

**They shouldn’t have laughed.**

**It began in the hallway.**

**I heard a soft, rhythmic tapping. Then a long, slow breath behind me.**

**And he was there.**

**The tall man. Pale as frost. Covered in eyes.He filled the hallway like a door that didn’t want to open.**

***“Avoid eye contact.”***

**Mason blinked. “Is this... part of the show?”**

**I turned too late to stop him.**

**He looked into one of the eyes — just one — high on the man’s shoulder.**

**He dropped the whiskey.**

**His knees buckled.**

**Then Mason screamed. A long, wet scream like his lungs were unraveling.**

**He clawed at his face. Blood streamed down his cheeks.**

**Then he went still. Eyes open. Empty.**

**Lucas grabbed my arm. “What is happening?”**

**“We have to leave. Now.”**

**But then I saw it.**

**The hatch.**

**A basement door in the floor that had not been there a moment before.**

**And standing at the edge of it was me.**

**Smiling. Beckoning.**

**“Come on,” the copy said. “He’s just freaking out. We’re okay down here.”**

**Lucas froze. “Why are you—?”**

**“It’s not me,” I said. “Lucas. That’s not me.”**

**But he was already walking.**

**I grabbed his arm.**

**He pulled away.**

**“Let me just check, man. Maybe there’s a way out.”**

**He stepped down into the dark.**

**The hatch closed.**

**Gone.**

**I stood in the hallway, knees trembling.**

**One friend dead on the floor, his face twisted with something he’d seen but never understood.The other swallowed whole by the house.**

***“If a basement appears, exit immediately. Do not re-enter without permission. You have one hour before your fate is sealed.”***

**The blue walls flickered.**

**And for a moment — just a moment — they turned green.**

**But only around the edges.**

**A warning.**

# [Chapter 7]

**Unknown Time*****The Basement Door Never Shuts***

**I didn’t hear the hatch open.**

**It was just there.**

**In the middle of the hallway, yawning wider than it ever had before, with no sound — just stillness. The air was wrong again, like it had come from somewhere else entirely.**

**Max growled. Deep. Low.**

**I stepped back, but the floor beneath my feet gave way — softening like rotten wood.**

**My body tipped forward.**

**Max barked, leaped toward me.**

**Then we were both falling.**

**Not down. Through.**

**I hit the floor hard.**

**Blue walls? Gone.**

**The walls here were green, but not like paint — more like mold blooming across living skin. Everything pulsed. The air stank of old coins and wet stone.**

***“If the walls turn green, you are in the basement. There is no way out.”***

**Max landed beside me, whimpering. His tail was down. His ears flat.**

**There were no stairs. No light source.Just hallways — impossible hallways that curved, twisted, led back into themselves.**

**The basement was a maze that didn’t obey the laws of space.**

**I walked anyway.**

**The deeper I went, the louder it got. Not noise — absence. The silence hurt my ears.**

**Max barked once.**

**Something was following us.**

**A shadow, taller than any wall should allow, moved along the hallway ahead.Its arms were too long. Its fingers dragged against the walls, and the walls twitched at the contact.**

**Its shape never stayed still. It shifted. Twitched. Pulsed.**

**Eyes flickered open and shut across its body — not like the many-eyed man, but like wounds.**

**A name was carved into the wall behind it, slowly bleeding ink.**

**⎎⏃⌰⌇⟒ ⊑⍜⌿⟒**

**My knees buckled.**

**The walls laughed.**

**Max snapped at the thing — barked with everything he had.But it didn’t flinch.**

**The Shadow didn’t move like a creature. It moved like a punishment.**

**And it was here for me.**

**We ran.**

**But the hallway stretched as we moved.Doors appeared where none had been.Every turn became two more turns.**

**The Shadow didn’t chase.**

**It just appeared ahead again.**

**Waiting.**

**We ducked into a narrow side hall.**

**Green lights pulsed from behind the walls like veins.**

**At the far end — a stairwell.**

**Real. Wooden. Blue.**

**It led up.**

**I grabbed Max by the collar and ran.**

**The hallway began to rot behind us — walls falling inward like lungs collapsing.The Shadow slid toward us like oil on glass.**

**Halfway up the stairs, Max stopped.**

**Growled.**

**Then turned back.**

**I pulled his collar.**

**He pulled free.**

**He looked at me — really looked — then charged down the stairs toward the thing.**

**I screamed.**

**But he didn’t stop.**

**He lunged at the Shadow.**

**They collided like silence and thunder.**

**The hallway shattered with noise.**

**I kept climbing.**

**I burst through the hatch.**

**The floor was blue again. The air is crisp.**

**But the door in the ground — the one Max had stayed behind to guard — was gone.**

**Like he’d taken it with him.**

# [Chapter 8]

**Morning**

***Another Offer***

**When I woke, I wasn’t sure I had ever slept.**

**I was on the floor at the top of the stairs, where the basement hatch had been.**

**It was gone now. Not sealed — erased. As if it had never existed. The floorboards were smooth, polished, untouched. No scratches. No hinges. No Max.**

**I called his name once. Then again.**

**Nothing answered.**

**The walls were blue again.**

**But they felt heavier now — like the house had eaten something and hadn’t finished digesting.**

**I walked the house slowly. The many-eyed man didn’t appear.The doppelgänger didn’t smile from the hallway.The mirror remained shattered.The snack cabinet was shut.**

**The house was… quiet.Full.**

**At the front door sat a small envelope.**

**No knock. No mailman.**

**Just wax sealed in red, stamped with J & G.**

**My fingers trembled as I opened it.**

**Inside was a handwritten note on crisp linen paper:**

**CONGRATULATIONS!**

**You have survived Property #221.**

**While we regret the loss of your dog and guests, we are pleased to inform you that your tenancy is complete.**

**Would you like to schedule a visit?**

**\[ \] Yes**

**\[ \] No**

**There was no pen.**

**No instructions.**

**Just the question.**

**I folded the letter and set it on the coffee table.Max’s collar sat beside it.**

**Somewhere, the house exhaled.**

**And I sat in the blue light, wondering how long it would take before the walls changed color again.**

He’s extremely pushy about it and will continue going after our food even after being told “no” and shoved away. We’ve caught him licking burritos, trying to run off with an entire al pastor taco and even climbing into the fridge. In the mornings, he licks the foam on my coffee. I’m not sure how to “discipline” him or if that would even work. As I said, I’ve always had dogs and I know what works with them would probably not be appropriate for a cat.

1lenues,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1lenues/new_to_specialty_coffee_multiple_bag_storage/,New to specialty coffee. Multiple bag storage.,"I’m new to the fancy coffee game and am looking at trying out some of the frequently lauded roasters.

I see that a lot of them offer free shipping for multiple bags. I’ve just learned this week that I should apparently be resting these coffees for a few weeks and then even freezing them after that if I’m not brewing them immediately.

So am I right in thinking there is seemingly no downside other than upfront cost to ordering a bunch of bags from various roasters, resting them all 4 weeks, then chucking them all in the freezer until I use them? I plan to just use one bag at a time and pouring the whole thing into my grinder hopper to brew for the week so there wouldn’t be any opening/closing of sealed bags.

Is 4 weeks a pretty safe rest spot for most bags? I figure it would be easier to give a longer rest if I have a bunch of bags all at once while I already have coffee on hand I’m currently drinking. 

I already have a vacuum sealer, so should I just seal each retail bag up in a vacuum seal bag? It seems like opening the retail bag before sealing would just lead to unnecessary oxidation. 

TL;DR: do I just fomo a bunch of bags and then chuck them all into the freezer after resting?

I’d water it every day at night, a small pour, with water id leave on the counter for 24hrs. I paused this recently in fear of root rot 

It used to be in an area with little to no sun. Now it’s in window that gets intense sun for a few hours in the morning.

The room I’m renting from gets pretty hot, so I moved it away from the window and closed the blinds.

I bought miracle miracle gro food, but have yet to use it. didn’t want to hurt the plant.

The leaves started having small lighter spots ( why I bought the plant food) that then grew to intense brown then shriveling completely. Even some of the real strong healthy leaves have browning on the ends. One leaf is still green but it’s a matte look to it

(Also there was some white spots on some of the top soil, I removed the top inch of soil in fear of fungus)

I just felt like it was the same and I wanted to do different things, but she just couldn't. She straight up told me she felt like she was asexual. It really hurt a lot, and idk I just felt like I deserved something. So I went online and found some men to sext with. Going so far to almost make plans to meet with one of them for coffee. I was going to come clean the night she stumbled onto the texts and she did not take it well. 

  
At first she (understandably) wanted to break up. I agreed crying a lot. But I brought up couples counseling and she agreed we could stay together if I did it. I quit my job to fit it into my schedule even. At first things seemed to have gotten better but she talked to her friend about it and her friend told her to dump me. And idk I guess it just weighed on her mind. It culminated when I tried to kill myself because of all the guilt I felt over cheating, and was sent to a residential program. I really felt like things were going to get better after the program but a day after I got out she broke up with me. We only ever did three sessions of couples counseling. 

  
She says she forgives me for cheating on her but I don't forgive myself. I loved her so much and I betrayed her. I deserved to be broken up with I know that, but I tried to so hard to fix things. I barely got a chance to show her that I could be better. But I know that kind of betrayal doesn't go away, so I guess I got what I deserved. I don't really know what this confession is going to bring me

  
TLDR: Sexted with guys, we tried couples counseling but ultimately she broke up with me. I realize my mistake but it still haunts me to this day.",1,1750269209.0,cheating_stories,1,0.67,False
1lenrkt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lenrkt,"David Clifford - “an atom of concern”, demands for a phone call and the inevitable Oil Rig explosion - Part 2","Evidently Scrabble users are expected to check in on their Scrabble friends.  David is very needy and constantly whines about Charlotte not checking in on him even though he has been silent as well.  Charlotte didn’t answer for 5 hours, but to David this meant “all day”.

Strong start.  After that I really wanted to have some fun with him.

David also wonders why I don’t drink coffee which must be a huge thing in Nigeria.  We get into the phone call request which I (Madison) steadfastly refuse to do.  Enter in the emotional manipulation script of “we were supposed to get along” and I must not really want him.  True on the second point, and who said we were supposed to get along?

Sorry Charlotte, but your refusal to take his call “doesn’t suit” David.  Heavens no!  Don’t let this Nigerian scammer get away!  Charlotte counters that she will pick him up from the Raleigh-Durham airport anytime he wants to “get to know me better” but duh!  She is forgetting he’s on a contract and on an oil rig!  So we must do this all online!  

He won’t let it go so Charlotte blames it partially on Kelvin who keeps blowing up her phone.  But David, unlike Kelvin, is a “man with integrity”.  Yes indeed.  Also a man who is about to lie about an oil rig explosion so he could scam her out of a lot of money.  That’s Nigerian “integrity” for you!

He keeps laying into her about making compromises but Charlotte doesn’t give in either.  In person or nothing.  Then he starts into this cryptic talk about feeling down and being let down.  Whatever.

A week passes and he lights into Charlotte (again!) for not contacting him.  Fuck him, he didn’t contact me either but expects all the blame to reside on Charlotte?  It’s your scam, bud.  Not mine.  You put in the work, you prick.  But Charlotte did not show an “atom of concern”.  David does indeed have a reason for coming back after a week’s disappearance.  

Kaboom!  The use of cell phones in the engine room has caused a “fire incident”.  The engine room, you know the one with the propellers?  On Platform Esther which was once an artificial island and definitely not mobile?  David knows more than me and is happy to educate.  I don’t know much about an oil rig but he knows even less.  Since Platform Esther is about a mile off the coast of the second largest metro area in the US, getting evacuated won’t be an issue.  

The ask is coming!

# 1.Chapter 1 Her Regret

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch—Brian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom—she never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place—to become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words—only to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# 2.Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless—like fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past—if Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times—she wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other—it looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again—so who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything—that all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night—reviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# 3.Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right—Jessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times—there's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens—I feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian—domineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began—there were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger—that something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call—what, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist—you're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided—she was going back.",1,1750268871.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1lenier,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1lenier/review_of_paradisus_palma_real_golf_spa_resort/,Review of Paradisus Palma Real Golf & Spa Resort,"My wife, our 17-month-old daughter, and I stayed at Palma Real from June 8–14 in a Junior Suite Swim-Up. I’d like to share an honest review of our experience.

  
Check-In: Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the front desk staff and assisted with our check-in. We had upgraded to a Junior Suite Swim-Up with a king-size bed, but were initially  
given a room with two smaller beds. After a long day of travel, we had to request a room change, which was inconvenient but ultimately resolved. For reference, this resort is operated  
by Meliá, a Spanish hotel group.

  
The Room: The room itself was spacious, well-maintained, and well-suited for a family. Housekeeping did a great job keeping it clean. Room service was slower than what we experienced at other resorts (usually 30–45 minutes), but still acceptable. The biggest issue was the air conditioning—it consistently felt warm despite being set to 69°F. It seemed as though the thermostat or AC unit wasn’t functioning properly, and at times the room became uncomfortably hot. The bathroom also had drainage issues; whenever we showered, water would leak into other areas, requiring extra towels to manage the mess. Additionally, although we had mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary, there were no acknowledgments or gestures from the resort, which was disappointing.

  
The Concierge and Timeshare Experience: Unfortunately, our experience with the concierge was the most upsetting part of our trip. From the beginning, we were persistently approached about attending a Meliá membership presentation. Despite repeatedly declining, we eventually agreed to attend out of courtesy—this turned out to be a major regret. The sales pitch was aggressive and pushy. We made it clear we were not interested in purchasing a $15,000 membership, yet the salespeople continued to pressure us, citing their quotas. During this presentation, our daughter fell from a chair and injured her forehead, which required attention and has since left a scar. The concierge assured us he would speak with his manager regarding compensation. However, we received no follow-up or support despite repeated communication (we have messages and photos documenting this). After returning home, the concierge reached out, but gave conflicting explanations about the manager’s availability. Ultimately, no compensation or real acknowledgment was provided. We plan to file a formal complaint with Costco, through whom we booked.

  
The Resort Grounds: The resort itself is beautiful and well-maintained, with plenty of available lounge chairs at the beach and pool, even on busy days. The swim-up suite was a great option for convenience and privacy. That said, there isn’t much catered to young children, and the spa was minimal—more of a massage cabana setup than a full-service spa.  
Food and Dining: The dining experience was mixed. The buffet and most restaurants were average—decent, but nothing exceptional. The steakhouse stood out as excellent, and the Japanese à la carte option was also very enjoyable. The coffee shop, Ginger, was fantastic. For contrast, we had an incredible meal off-site at a local Dominican chain, Doña Pula, which we  
highly recommend. One frustration was having to make all reservations through the concierge, rather than using an app or streamlined system.

  
Wi-Fi: The wi-fi was terrible at this location, if you are planning on using anything please buy your own data.

  
Summary: While we appreciated some relaxing moments during our stay, there were several shortcomings that left us disappointed. Between the room issues, unfulfilled promises, and especially the negative experience with the sales presentation and lack of follow-up regarding our daughter’s injury, we do not plan to return to this property. We hope our feedback helps future travelers make informed decisions.",1,1750268603.0,PuntaCana,0,1.0,False

I'd also like to see their friends and families reacting to the domesticity of their arrangement and finding it peculiar that they seem to dislike the other but still seem so close with them. I don't mind any kind of setting. They don't have to be living in the same house, they can also be neighbours who dislike each other but still hangout or go to the other's house etc. It also doesn't have to be the main trope even though I'd like that very much.

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?

Today, I'm monitoring a position closely, and I'm on the fence. Same position as yesterday.

I have stock in CRWV with a basis of \~$125.60 bought at the first part of the month. Current spot is \~$168.80, down $3 from yesterday's close. I have a covered call with a strike of $165 expiring Friday.

Here's the issue. CRWV is so volatile, I wouldn't be shocked if it dropped well below my strike on Friday, and I'd still be holding the stock. Sure, I could sell Monday, but the whole point is to avoid a significant hit...I want them called away as I think they're going to drop soon.

I could close the whole position down for a net of \~$162.06/share, but then I'd be ""losing out"" on $2.94/share if I waited and it remained above $165. That's a chunk of change.

Here's the stupid idea: it'd be nice to place an order based on the time value of the option reaching a certain point.

Here's a screenshot from Fidelity of my position.

https://preview.redd.it/q88wpj911q7f1.jpg?width=437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04df61d0829734acd9428500ba318231c9c90191

As you can see, the short call has an extrinsic value of $2.2624. How about I say, ""BTC when Time Value = $1.00 or less"". Maybe I haven't thought it through, the idea just struck me, but I was thinking that would be handy.

Edit 1: Yeah, in this case, the Time Value could drop to $1 and the stock simultaneously drops to $135...triggering the closing of the positions. Wouldn't want that. Maybe it'd be a useful concept for less volatile tickers, or where people like to close at 50% premium.

Edit 2: Yeah, I can set a limit order to close the whole trade down: it's considered a ""buy/write"" (while in reverse). So, in the example above, the net position is $169.55 - $6.90 or $162.65. I could set a limit order for, say, $164.",2,1750267985.0,StockOptionCoffeeShop,0,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to soft drinks, many people are left wondering whether certain beverages align with their dietary preferences, particularly those following a vegan lifestyle. Among these drinks, Diet Coke is widely popular, but its vegan status often raises questions. So, is Diet Coke vegan? Let’s delve into the ingredients and some ethical considerations surrounding this flavor-packed beverage.

### Understanding Diet Coke Ingredients

The first step in determining whether Diet Coke is suitable for vegans is to analyze its ingredients. According to its label, the primary components of Diet Coke include:

- Carbonated water
- Caramel color
- NutraSweet (aspartame)
- Phosphoric acid
- Caffeine
- Citric acid
- Natural flavors

Upon scrutinizing these ingredients, it becomes clear that they don’t contain any animal-derived products. Therefore, from a purely ingredient-based perspective, Diet Coke does not include components typically associated with non-vegan items.

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
### Breaking Down Each Ingredient

To better understand the vegan status of Diet Coke, let’s break down some of the key ingredients:

#### Carbonated Water

As the main ingredient, carbonated water is simply water infused with carbon dioxide gas, making it a vegan-friendly choice.

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
#### Caramel Color

This common food coloring is often made from heating sugar, without any animal derivatives. It is generally recognized as vegan.

#### NutraSweet (Aspartame)

Aspartame, a crucial player in providing Diet Coke its sweetness, is synthesized from aspartic acid and phenylalanine—both of which are amino acids found in various plants. Therefore, aspartame does not contain animal products, making it vegan.

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
#### Phosphoric Acid and Citric Acid

Both phosphoric and citric acids are often derived from plant sources or through synthetic processes. They are safe for vegans and remain within the parameters of a vegan diet.

#### Caffeine and Natural Flavors

Caffeine is typically derived from either coffee or tea, both of which are plant-based. Natural flavors can be a bit trickier, as they may sometimes be animal-derived, depending on the source. However, in the case of Diet Coke, these are confirmed to be vegan.

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
### Ethical Considerations in Drinking Diet Coke

While the ingredients of Diet Coke may be vegan, ethical considerations go beyond what is in the can. Many vegans choose their products based on broader philosophies concerning animal rights, environmental sustainability, and health implications. Here are some points to ponder:

#### Environmental Impact

The production of Diet Coke, like many mass-produced beverages, has an environmental footprint. The carbonation process and packaging can contribute to pollution and resource depletion. Many vegans are conscious of their environmental impact and might opt for homemade options.

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
#### Health Considerations

Diet sodas have been a topic of debate concerning their health effects, with studies linking excessive consumption to various health issues. Some vegan communities focus on whole-food diets, so frequent consumption of Diet Coke might not align with their health-conscious decisions.

#### Corporate Ethics

The company behind Diet Coke, Coca-Cola, has faced scrutiny regarding water usage in developing countries and labor practices. Consider choosing brands that prioritize sustainability and ethical production to stay aligned with a vegan ethos that values animal rights and environmental health.

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
### Your Choice Matters

Diet Coke is technically vegan in terms of its ingredients. However, as a consumer, you may wish to weigh other factors such as health implications, environmental impact, and the ethics of the company behind the drink. Being informed allows you to make choices that truly align with your values and dietary preferences. Remember, your choices shape not only your lifestyle but also the world around you.

So, next time you reach for a Coke, consider the broader picture, and always opt for what resonates with your values.

Exploring the Health Effects of Diet Coke in a Plant-Based Lifestyle
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As more individuals embrace veganism and plant-based lifestyles, the question of what beverages to include arises. One popular choice is Diet Coke, a fizzy drink favored by many for its zero-calorie appeal. But is it suitable for those following a vegan diet? Let’s take a closer look at the health effects of Diet Coke, especially for individuals living a plant-based lifestyle.

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
Diet Coke primarily consists of carbonated water, artificial sweeteners, flavorings, and caffeine. Most importantly, it does not contain any animal-derived ingredients, which makes it align with the basic principles of veganism. Therefore, from an ingredient perspective, yes, Diet Coke is vegan-friendly. However, that’s only one component of its consumption consideration—what about its health impacts?

### Your Daily Dose of Caffeine

Caffeine can be both a pro and a con in your daily diet. In Diet Coke, caffeine is present, providing a quick energy boost. Many people enjoy this aspect, especially when they need a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. However, it's essential to remember that excessive caffeine can lead to negative consequences, such as:

[Get The Vegan Warrior ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
- Increased heart rate
- Anxiety and nervousness
- Sleep disturbances

Being mindful of your caffeine intake can help you strike the perfect balance, especially in a plant-based lifestyle where focus on overall health is key.

### Understanding Artificial Sweeteners

One of the primary ingredients in Diet Coke is aspartame, a common artificial sweetener. While it allows for a sweet taste without the calories, its long-term effects are often debated. Some studies suggest potential health risks associated with excessive consumption of artificial sweeteners, which can include:

- Altered gut microbiota
- Increased cravings for sugary foods
- Potential weight gain over time

For those living a plant-based lifestyle, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods is essential. While an occasional Diet Coke may not be harmful, relying on it regularly may divert you from healthier beverage options like fruit-infused water or herbal teas.

### Hydration Considerations

Staying hydrated is crucial for everyone, especially those consumed with plant-based nutrients. While Diet Coke does provide some liquid intake, it’s worth noting that carbonated drinks can sometimes have a dehydrating effect on the body. This might lead you to choose less beneficial beverages over time. Thus, prioritize water as your primary source of hydration.

### Weight Management and Cravings

One reason many opt for Diet Coke is its low-calorie count, which can be attractive for individuals concerned about weight management. However, some research suggests that consuming non-caloric sweeteners may trick your brain into craving more sugary foods, leading to increased overall calorie intake. This counterproductive cycle can disrupt your goals in maintaining a healthy plant-based lifestyle.

### Mental Well-Being

Aside from physical health effects, think about how Diet Coke might affect your mental wellness. Some people report feeling jittery or anxious after consuming caffeinated beverages. If you find that Diet Coke affects your mood negatively, it may be wise to rethink your drinking habits.

### Cultural Influences

In some cultures or social circles, drinking Diet Coke comes with its own set of norms and expectations. However, it's essential to question whether those norms fit your personal health goals and lifestyle choices. You could opt for healthier alternatives that also provide social enjoyment without compromising your diet.

While Diet Coke may be vegan-friendly, the overall health impacts it presents should make you think critically about its place in your diet. Balancing occasional indulgence with healthier options will not only benefit your overall well-being but also align better with the principles of a plant-based lifestyle. It's ultimately your personal decision, so take the time to explore alternatives and find out what works best for you!

### Conclusion

Understanding whether Diet Coke is vegan involves looking closely at its ingredients and the ethical implications. The primary components of Diet Coke, including carbonated water, artificial sweeteners, flavoring agents, and caffeine, do not contain any direct animal products. This means, from an ingredient perspective, Diet Coke can be classified as vegan-friendly. However, many vegans also consider ethical concerns regarding manufacturing practices and the environmental impact of large beverage corporations.

When incorporating Diet Coke into a plant-based lifestyle, it’s essential to think about health impacts. While sugar-free and low-calorie, Diet Coke contains artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Some studies raise questions about the long-term health effects of these sweeteners, which may be a consideration for those pursuing a holistic approach to veganism. Listening to your body and understanding how Diet Coke fits within your own dietary preferences can guide your choices.

Ultimately, whether you choose to sip on a Diet Coke should depend on individual health goals and ethical beliefs. It could be a refreshing treat for some, while others may prefer to explore more natural beverage options that align with their lifestyle values. Always remember that moderation is key, and staying informed about what you consume can contribute to a healthier, more balanced plant-based diet. So, as you navigate the vegan landscape, feel empowered to make choices that resonate with you, both ethically and health-wise.

A 30 Step Checklist for Gaining Financial Freedom,"Hey retirement enthusiasts! After years of planning my own early retirement journey and helping others navigate theirs, I've compiled the ultimate 30-step checklist that actually works. Trust me, I wish I had this when I started!

Let's get real - early retirement isn't just about having a massive nest egg (though that helps!). It's about creating a sustainable lifestyle that brings you joy without the 9-to-5 grind. When I first started, I was overwhelmed by all the advice out there, but I've learned it's about taking consistent, strategic steps.

First things first: you need to know your target number. I remember panicking when I calculated mine - it seemed impossible! But here's the thing: breaking it down into manageable chunks makes it less daunting. For me, that meant starting with eliminating my $30k credit card debt before even thinking about retirement savings.

The game-changer? Building passive income streams. I started with dividend stocks and eventually ventured into rental properties. Now these investments cover about 40% of my monthly expenses. Remember, every little bit counts!

One often-overlooked aspect is the psychological side of early retirement. I've seen too many friends save diligently but struggle to actually spend their money in retirement. That's why defining your purpose is crucial. For me, it's traveling and teaching financial literacy to others.

Healthcare is another biggie that catches many off guard. I learned this the hard way when I had an unexpected surgery last year. Now I factor in health insurance costs and maintain healthy habits to keep medical expenses down.

Pro tip: translate your spending into ""retirement time."" That $5 daily coffee? That's about $1,825 annually, which could be an extra month of early retirement. This mindset shift helped me cut unnecessary expenses without feeling deprived.

Consider geographic arbitrage too. I'm currently exploring retiring in Portugal where my projected expenses would be 40% lower than in the US. This could potentially shave years off my retirement timeline!

The key is automation. I automated my savings years ago, and honestly, I barely notice the money leaving my account anymore. When I paid off my car loan, that payment went straight to retirement savings - an extra $400 monthly that I was already used to not having.

Remember, early retirement doesn't mean never working again. I'm planning to do consulting work part-time because I genuinely enjoy it. It's about having the freedom to choose what you do with your time.

I'd love to hear from others in our community - what strategies have worked for you? Any unique approaches to building your early retirement plan? Let's share our experiences and learn from each other!

P.S. Don't forget about catch-up contributions if you're over 50 - it's like a turbo boost for your retirement savings! I just started taking advantage of this myself and it's making a significant difference.",2,1750267004.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False
1lemsu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodpressure/comments/1lemsu3/i_need_help_getting_started/,I need help getting started,"I'll try to keep this brief. I am a 42m, 5'10, 200 lb. I have a muscular build, I weight lift three days a week and train BJJ three times a week. My BP averages around 135/79. My GP gave me linirpil (sp?)and it did quite literally nothing except kill my erections. She has no prescribed me Amoldipine but I am terrified to take it due to the anxiety, depression issues people report. I have generalized anxiety disorder and already take Lexapro for it. 

I want to tackle this on my own before I commit to another med. i work evenings. I drink two double shot espresso lattes in the morning when I get up with my young children (wife is at work) and then 2 coffees at night when I'm at work. Right now I get about 5 hours of sleep a night.

I'm normally pretty healthy and fit, but the last few months I've gotten in on the junk/processed food a fair bit.

I take testosterone and cholesterol meds as well. 

My question is, if you were me where would you start? I want to cut the morning coffee in half and get the diet on track. Is there anything else that you would add or take away? 

For people who are *very* fit, what do your workouts look like?

1lemsn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ostomy/comments/1lemsn5/grainy_output/,grainy output,"I know I've posted about this before, but it's still an issue. I've got a loop ileo, so output can be pretty high and is usually very liquid (occasionally the consistency of oatmeal, but more often somewhere between that and liquid heavy cream). However, it's usually pretty dark (not black, but very dark brown) and frequently has lots of small black grains in it, which look just like finely ground coffee. I went to my family doctor, who immediately ordered a FIT test, which I got done within 36 hours of talking to my doc. But the test wasn't done until 4 days after seeing that graininess in the output, by which time there was no trace of it, and unsurprisingly, it came back negative. The grainy output is not constant, but it is very frequent, and it's still an issue, to varying degrees. Diet doesn't seem to be a massive factor, in that it doesn't seem to be associated with specific foods, though with certain foods I rarely see it: white bread and pasta. However, I can't live on just white bread and pasta, and more to the point, I'm very concerned about the recurrence of those tiny black grains; when they show up, there are a lot of them, and everything I've been told by HCPs and read on medical sites keep pointing at an upper GI bleed. 

Anyone had a similar experience with dark, grainy but pretty liquid ileostomy output on a regular basis? ",1,1750266942.0,ostomy,0,1.0,False

my grandma is the most toxic and manipulative person i’ve ever had the pleasure of being around. now ofc ur first thought is, well cut her off! or tell her about herself! or whatever. but let me explain: 

my first word was grandma. my mom was a teen mom. growing up, my grandma and I were best friends. there was a time where I (still feel guilty about this) kind of convinced myself I loved her more than my own mom. my home life was very stressful growing up, very tense and we constantly lived in poverty, and my grandma’s was the safe and fun and most important, consistent place I felt I had as a child. 

we would have our tea or coffee together every morning, we would watch old tv shows and alfred hitchcock movies and listen to 60s rock music. She shaped so much of who I am today. in my eyes she could do no wrong, and I couldn’t believe it when I was younger and my mom and her stopped talking as we do in our family sometimes, and I ofc blamed my mom. 

flash forward to now, i’m an adult, my grandma is getting older. it’s scary. so many things have happened since we were all younger. i learned how abusive she was to my mom even while she was pregnant with me, I’ve seen the way she manipulates and says things just to hurt people around her, how she literally takes joy in making everyone around her feel bad about themselves. 

I’ve dealt with and overcame a lot, especially with mental health issues and financially. i’ve grown so much as a person in general, but I don’t know how to be around her anymore. sometimes she makes you love her and feel so loved. and then the next minute she’s ranting about how she hates my mom who I realize now was just doing her best as a single teen mom of 2 kids. 

she’s so nasty and disrespectful to my mom, in every way, big and small. we all just always let it go and call her crazy, but then i’m hit with the guilt that she’s getting older, she’s alone, not in the best health, but definitely guilt tripping me sometimes. 

but it’s not like when I was younger. i’m not that naive, i’m smarter, kinder, and know boundaries. but I still can’t help but feel guilty when she asks me to come over yet again and I have to say no. ",1,1750266878.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False

The person who counts this tip pool is generally whoever is the first to leave, and thus it's not a shift lead or supervisor role responsibility.

I was curious, does this count as asking an employee to work off-the-clock? These tips are not recorded in any way and thus aren't taxed. I've found a lot of conflicting information on the topic and would like some clearer answers. Thank you!",1,1750266826.0,AskLawyers,1,1.0,False
1lemqpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1lemqpb/surrogacy_bad_flamethrowers_good_a_reproductive/,"Surrogacy Bad, Flamethrowers Good: a reproductive rant","I don’t know if this is a plea, a rant or a confession, but I’m looking for some honest discussion about Canada’s fertility industry, particularly surrogacy agencies.

And if you’re expecting a heartfelt story about how my husband and I are good people who would love and cherish a child, build treehouses, and get a dog, it’s not coming. However much it might be true, that’s not gonna happen here.

Why?

Because I’ve been bled dry—emotionally, financially and physically—by an industry that looks at women and sees dollar signs.

After 8 years, three losses, six surgical procedures and more than $100,000, I have no children, no fucks left to give and just enough dignity not to get on my knees, spew out my medial history and beg for biological clemency on a public forum (again).

I’m not (only) sad, I’m not (only) heartbroken, I’m enraged by a paternalistic system that gaslights women, commodifying their bodies while claiming to protect them. 

In Canada, it is illegal to pay a surrogate for their (literal) labour. A woman cannot be paid for carrying another person’s child.

However, third-party agencies are 100% able to profit from surrogates and intended parents. There are entire businesses dedicated to this, people who make their living off women’s bodies, off their hopes and their dreams, and the Canadian government is A-OK with it.

For example, there are Canadian surrogate agencies owned (in part) by men who are not citizens of Canada, who don’t live here and never have. These men stand to earn thousands of dollars every time a Canadian woman takes on the risks of pregnancy and delivery through their agency, while the women earn nothing.

Why does the Canadian Government allow this? Why are surrogates told they must be altruistic, while others are allowed to be enriched by the bodies of strangers?

The government says this is to protect women.

The average cost of engaging a surrogacy agency in Canada is about $22,000. That doesn’t include the cost of IFV, legalities, or the surrogate's expenses, which intended parents (obviously and rightly) incur. The total cost of having a child through a surrogate can be as high as $200,000 in some cases.

So, what do these essentially unregulated surrogacy agencies offer? Often, it boils down to asking a couple to film a “tear-jerker” video, write a sad story, and provide “happy couple” photos that the agency can post on social media or their website.

Oh, you’re going to make a social media post?! Why didn’t I ever think of that? Yes, please take all my money!

“You really want to tug at the heartstrings,” one agency told me, urging me to include all of the worst moments of my life.

It’s a dehumanizing system that forces people struggling with infertility to publicly relive their trauma over and over again, at great expense. It’s sick. It’s disgusting.

It’s also a system that makes no promises. Agencies do not guarantee that they can match potential parents with a gestational surrogate, and Canadian couples often find themselves pitted against wealthy European or Australian couples operating in a regulatory vacuum.

(If a match is made—and it’s a big if, because there’s no public reporting required by these companies, so records are opaque— the agency does act as a go-between for expense payments and sets up two meetings with a clinical social worker. Is that worth 22 grand? You tell me.)

Now, you might be asking why intended parents don’t post their own advertisements, seeking altruistic surrogates. The answer is that most advertisers won’t take them. 

Kijiji Canada currently has at least three flamethrowers listed for sale.

But they took down my surrogacy post because of “safety, health, and legal risks.” 

Unlike a flamethrower that can be fired up in any public space, achieving a gestational surrogacy requires a team of doctors and other medical professionals, clinical evaluations, legal contracts and tens of thousands of dollars. Unlike selling a deadly weapon designed for trench warfare, it doesn’t happen at a local coffee shop.

C’mon, am I really the threat to public safety here? I mean, what the fuck?

To be clear, I think women should be paid for all the labour they do. By what mechanism that would happen in a situation like this is a topic for another post, but if $22,000 has to go somewhere, it should go to the woman putting her emotional and physical well-being on the line so that someone else has a shot at parenthood. 

Of course, many people do pay surrogates under the table, or so I was told by a doctor at my local fertility clinic. The founder of one Canadian surrogacy agency, which continues to operate, was convicted of it in 2014, and I’ve heard of people inflating expenses to give surrogates expensive items, like new vehicles … something I haven’t been able to afford for the last 17 years.

There is so much to say, but this post is already too long. And I’ve barely scraped the surface: I haven’t even mentioned the surrogacy app used for sex trafficking, the scams, the mental health worker who pledged to be my surrogate, then backed out one year later after revealing her husband didn’t approve, the guy with the horses, the fist fight or the Republic of Georgia. 

So I’ll finish with this.

We keep saying that Canada has a public healthcare system, that we uphold human rights, and that we don’t discriminate. But the truth is, we have a multi-tier healthcare system designed for profiteering.

I’m currently employed right now and use my CS degree for work every day even though I didn’t go into software engineering. Looking back from when I first started applying to internships my freshman year of college, there is so much I wish I knew looking back that would have saved me a lot of grief that I see people on here facing. In my case, I relate to the “I submitted 1000 applications and only heard back from 5!” crowd and learned some things through the process that eventually let me cut down my apps to like ~50 my senior year before getting an offer. These would probably be:

1. Internships after freshman/sophomore year are rare. There are always exceptions to the rule with talented people, but you can safely bet that a lot of students with internships lined up that early have a friend/family connection. Shoot for the moon but if not, look for research or other opportunities at your school.
1a. SUBPOINT- one big exception to this is the variety of diversity programs offered at many companies, which will sometimes have first or second year explicit internship programs, or for other communities. If you quality in any way, apply!!!
2. If a job was posted more than a week ago, do not apply. Maybe some of you have learned this already but when I first started, I’d apply to jobs on Linkedin with 20+ days since posting. I’m sorry, they’re probably not going to see your application.
3. Some postings you have to sus out. Certain smaller to mid-size companies are just terribly organized with their opportunities/careers page and while I can’t put it into words, after 1000 applications you can just tell which companies are serious about expanding their team and will reach out.
4. Finally, networking events are for networking itself. Not a guaranteed job. There’s no event you can go to for coffee chats that will set you up to be a shoe-in a job. However, meeting people and going in with the intention of finding what job is right for you, what experiences inspire you the most, and getting a sense of business needs and what could be useful to show off down the line is extremely helpful. I wish I did more of this, since I feel that I was desperate in a way for a job that I didn’t do enough research. Nothing to panic over if you don’t, I do like my job. But having your head on straight at the beginning of your career can help TONS.

Anyways, does anyone agree with these points? I feel like I never see anyone talking about points 1-3. All the advice I got was about resume tuning, networking, and other random stuff that in itself is helpful but didn’t save me my sophomore year from applying to hundreds of internships that were never going to reply to me.

It takes me about an hour to even open my eyes and drink my coffee in the morning. It takes so much time and effort to get up, take a shower, do my makeup and hair, and drive to work within any reasonable amount of time, that I just decided not to do it.  



The inspiration happened by accident one day. The Sunday evening before work I had a nice dinner to attend, so I had showered in the evening, done my hair and makeup, and went out. When I got home, I was too exhausted to wash up, so I just brushed my teeth and lay flat on my back and fell asleep. 



When the alarm went off at 6, I dozed…until 7, then jumped up in a panic because I didn’t have time to get ready. But I looked in the mirror, and my makeup and hair hadn’t moved or smudged, so I just blotted it a bit, brushed on some powder, and went to work. I looked the same as always. 



So then I thought, why am I torturing myself in the mornings? Now, I take a shower and get ready for work before bed. As long as I don’t toss and turn, things usually turn out just dandy. If I do have a makeup smudge, it’s quickly fixable. I get to sleep in, and the panic of getting ready for work is gone.

My wife had to take my daughter to a doctors appointment this morning and went through the drive through at a local but national establishment and ordered her usual coffee and breakfast wrap. As she was about 3/4 done with her wrap she noticed the bag started to move. There was a rat in her breakfast wrap wrapper!!

Luckily she was nearly at the doctors office and started filming her experience. You can clearly see the rodent in the wrapper through a large hole it chewed trying to get out of the bag. 

Being the skeptic I am I inspected the wrapper and the car seat when she got home and I can’t see any evidence of the rat residing in our car to begin with.  She would have felt it trying to get into the wrapper when she reached for another bite of the wrap on her passenger seat. We have a relatively new vehicle that just went in for service this past Monday. The inside was detailed before we picked it up as part of the dealerships service routine. 

My wife called the store to tell them about her experience and they quickly dismissed her and told her that she planted it there and there was no possible way that could happen. She has called the corporate office but can’t get anyone from the United States to field her complaint. 

Meanwhile, I was dialing up lawyers. We are not looking to get compensation for this. We are merely looking for some accountability. One of the people I talked to at a large firm said we would be better to make her videos go viral. Unless there is a sickness or injury involved with this, no one wants to take this case on. Again, we are not looking for compensation, only some accountability. 

Luckily my wife got back from urgent care and they said if she starts feeling ill to come back in. 

Would there be any legal ramifications against us should we choose to put this company on blast?  She recorded 2 videos as they happened when the situation went down this morning. Just looking for some advice and wanting to make sure no one else has to experience what my wife did. She is a germaphobe as it is and this only adds to her anxiety.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?



# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://mitolynseller.com/order-now)



What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.



# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://mitolynseller.com/order-now)

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.



# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://mitolynseller.com/order-now)

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

Here’s how to craft a realistic, high-impact morning routine that actually sticks:

# 🌅 1️⃣ Wake Up Consistently

Forget the hour — focus on consistency. Waking up at the same time daily trains your circadian rhythm, so your energy levels stay stable. Pick a realistic time and stick to it, even on weekends.

# 💧 2️⃣ Hydrate First Thing

After hours of sleep, you’re dehydrated. Drink a big glass of water before coffee — it wakes up your brain and kickstarts metabolism.

# 🧘 3️⃣ Move Your Body Early

You don’t need a full workout. 5–10 minutes of light stretching, yoga, or push-ups boost circulation and make you feel more alert.

# ✍️ 4️⃣ Practice Intentional Journaling

Spend a few minutes writing:

* 3 things you’re grateful for
* 1 thing you want to focus on today
* 1 thing you’re excited about This primes your mind for positivity and purpose.

# 📵 5️⃣ Protect a Phone-Free Hour

Don’t check social media or emails right away. Give your brain time to wake up without digital noise hijacking your mood and focus.

# 🔑 6️⃣ Tackle a “Big Win” Early

Do your most important task first — when your mind is fresh and distractions are low. One solid win in the morning builds momentum for the whole day.

# 🔄 7️⃣ Keep It Flexible

A rigid routine collapses on tough days. Design a *minimum version* (e.g., water + 5 min stretch + gratitude) so you never fully skip it.

# ✅ Pro Tip: Stack Habits

Link each step naturally. For example: Wake up → drink water → stretch → journal → big task. The flow makes it effortless.",1,1750266070.0,TheGrowthPath,0,1.0,False

This Friday I’ll be entering my second week of constant nausea, and I’m currently in week 7 of my pregnancy. It’s really starting to feel unmanageable. I feel the worst in the mornings and usually can’t eat anything until around lunchtime. If I try to eat earlier, it often leads to vomiting, so I try to avoid that.

I’ve also become super sensitive to food smells and can no longer cook, just the smell of regular food makes me nauseous. Most foods disgust me right now, but I can still handle coffee, crackers, chips, bread, mild yogurt, and lots of fruit. Strangely enough, I can also tolerate junk food, which I know isn’t ideal.

I’m starting to worry because I’m not eating properly and it feels very unhealthy. Do you have any tips on what kind of food might be easier to eat during this phase? Ready meals, cold food, snacks, anything that doesn’t involve much cooking or strong smells would be amazing. I’d be so grateful for any advice or suggestions ❤️",3,1750265877.0,pregnant,5,1.0,False

Just got back from an amazing trip to Ladakh and honestly, it was one of the most peaceful yet thrilling trips I’ve ever done.

I went with a travel community called **WanderOn** (highly recommend if you’re into group trips but still want chill vibes). We did all the classic spots—**Khardung La**, **Nubra Valley**, **Pangong**, **Tso Moriri**, and even made it to **Hanle** for some crazy clear stargazing 🌌

Few random highlights:

* Had the best coffee at **Lehvenda Cafe** in Leh (trust me, you’ll need it after the altitude hits lol)
* Rented a Royal Enfield to ride around—epic roads, epic views, sore bum 😅
* The silence at Pangong Lake early in the morning is something else
* Also saw a live *ice hockey match* during practice season—it’s intense!

If you're planning soon, let me know. Happy to share tips or just hype you up 😄

This resent loss of a beloved Canadian team rings a bell in the souls of Canadian hockey fans across our great nation. However, instead of being reflective of our feelings we get up, have a ritualistic morning coffee with our tuk on and crawl about a regular work day like nothing happened. At least until we are trigger by that one asshole wearing a Florida jersey in celebration of their victory today. We boil over. Plan to collect costs of parts and labour on their ‘burnout headlight’ and magically ‘deflating tires’. We watch their every move on the off season from now on because… they aren’t one of us. They took the cup from us. 

And instead of looking to improve ourselves and our own environment. We use this chance to take every economical advantage away from the future play in true sportsmanship. A superiority complex that extends beyond the 3 periods of play and into every day life battling away at everyone like they are either friend or foe.

Competitive nature has this way with our brains to exclude the weak, to think our own efforts amount to our own success when the truth is. Edmonton still stands. Thunder Bay still stands. 

I only ask do you stand for “I don’t know what you need.” Or “let me look into that for you and help us all become a winning team”

Thanks again for comments and my friend for letting me use her profile. 

So I met GGP (great grandparents) and what they said and showed blew my mind. Still in shock n numb. 

So what happened? I met them and their career Barb (Fake name obv) and basically my stbx has been lying to me, manipulating me, just all over betrayal and they have receipts!! 

This all started a about a month ago when GGP were staying at our house while their new drive and garden was being done, Barb was tidying up and see a slip for the contraceptive pill in my name in my stbx own room (we have our own small rooms where we keep things for hobbies, and just our own space away from everything and everyone) anyway she found this and thought it odd as she knows how much I want kids, she went and spoke to GGP and they added a camera into our kitchen (really don't know how I feel about this currently) the footage showed when hubby was sorting our daily vitamins out he had a lock box hidden. Short version:
Hubby was called away for some family thing and me n Barb looked for box n key, found the key in his own room and sure enough in the lock box in its wrapper ""Cerazette"" (which is a contraceptive pill) I was floored, barb tool a pic an put everything back, we went for a coffee n I just sat there numb but thankful I wasn't on my own even tho we weren't speaking. 
They also showed me a recording of stbx speaking to his cousin who somehow found out what he was doing and warned him it wouldn't be pretty when I did, his response ""she's everything the way she is, we have time, she looks good, we have money, we don't need a rugrat to ruin that she belives everything and anything i say and does what i want when i want shell never find out"" absolutely shocked i didn't recognise the person I was hearing. He wanted the Instagram ascetic n I wanted a humble family, can't belive how foolish I've been.

What about the will? Well they wanted to inc me as a ""compensation for grandsons s**ty  behaviour"" was very strange hearing poppi swear. They apologised for him and the way they went about this and new i wouldnt belive without proof (this is veru true) i didn't ask about how or why they were recording family, that's something I feel I can't deal with right now I can only assume there is good reason given the fortune they have built with their children. As my friend says money corrupts and this is definitely an example of that.

They are helping me, instead of leaving it to when they pass they are helping me now, they are paying for my divorce lawer, buying me a new house for a fresh start, paying any an all expenses while I take time out for therapy (nonni said they will be using what he would have received from them for me now) I'm greatful but I don't understand why? They say it's the right thing to do, just feels like their taking accountability away from him but again I don't know what they have planned for him. 

Their not a stupid couple, still Sharp as ever, still that matriarchal piller of the family.
 
Trying to be normal around stbx is breaking me, not sure if I want to just do a midnight flip or curse him out till the sun comes up, so much of my life wasted, all I do know is this is my last few days in my home I fell in love with, with neighbours who I adore, and a life that is a lie.

I won't be doing another update I need time and lots and lots of therapy. 

If anyone takes anything from this, don't let others control your meds and be very careful, I trusted this man with my life, i know there are others who have been through the same taking meds and things not realising there was a sinister motive.

The way in which Virgin Red functions is that you get points as cashback for each qualifying purchase you make with one of their partnered retailers (there’s quite a few!) and then you can redeem those points against vouchers and discounts on other products.

They are for a limited time **offering 1,000 points to new sign ups** who create an account using [**this link**](https://virginred.mention-me.com/m/ol/dl6kl-alkesh-meghani) and make any qualifying purchase (of any amount!) through a partnered retailer

Sometimes life here in VA can be filled with poop for absolutely no reason. You start the day off with a cup of coffee at a local coffee shop, and the next thing you know there's poop all over your pants and your shoes!

You boldly praise The Lord and are regularly overjoyed with spreading the Light of Jesus in your household and your family excommunicates you and shuns you from all family gatherings!!

Are you gonna let that dim your light????

ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! In fact, you're going to shine even BRIGHTER and rejoice because that's what you've been called to do!!

Let’s be honest: when you need something fast — like a plumber, coffee shop, or mobile repair guy — what do you type on Google?

“Near me.”

And in 2025, this search behavior is only getting stronger. Whether it’s restaurants near me, coworking spaces near me, or pharmacies near me, Google is prioritizing local search results like never before. That’s why Local SEO is a must-have strategy now — not just an option.

# Why 'Near Me' is Exploding in 2025?

**1️⃣ Voice Search is Everywhere**

People now ask Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa things like “Where’s the nearest ATM?” These voice searches often include “near me” or “open now.”

**2️⃣ Google Map Pack Rules the Page**

In most local searches, Google shows a 3-pack of businesses with reviews, maps, and hours before any website links. If you’re not there, you’re invisible.

**3️⃣ Smartphones Drive Intent**

Mobile users searching “near me” usually want to take action right away — like calling, visiting, or booking. That means higher conversion rates!

**4️⃣ Hyper-Local Personalization**

Google now uses your location, search history, and behavior to show different results to different people — even if they search the same thing. So your local reputation and SEO setup really matters.

# How to Win at Local SEO in 2025?

**✅ Claim & Optimize Your Google Business Profile**

Add photos, correct info, business hours, service areas, and real updates. This is your Local SEO lifeline.

**✅ Earn 5-Star Reviews (Genuinely!)**

More reviews = more trust. Google values high ratings, especially recent ones.

**✅ Use Location-Based Keywords**

Use city names, neighborhoods, and “near me” phrases naturally in your content and metadata.

**✅ Get Local Backlinks & Listings**

Be listed on IndiaMart, Justdial, and local directories. Collaborate with other local businesses too.

**✅ Focus on Mobile-Friendly Websites**

If your site loads slowly or is hard to use on mobile, Google might ignore it in local results.

# Final Thoughts

In 2025, the businesses that win online aren’t just the biggest — they’re the closest, most trusted, and best-reviewed. If you’re running a local business and not focusing on “near me” SEO, you’re leaving real money on the table.

It’s not about beating the whole internet anymore — it’s about showing up at the right time for the right people in your area.",1,1750265127.0,u_SutanuDey92,0,1.0,False

For service, the colleague I work with was only 6 months my senior (unbeknownst to me at the time).

. Colleague (james for the sake of the story) is of Indian decent,  and i am 99% sure he is on the spectrum. My first day, bro tooted in my face, im correcting him on how to use basic tools, and multiple times a day he asks me how is he doing, is he doing a good job?, are we friends?, etc....

Im cordial with him, im also older than him. But his constant need for validation is starting to get to me. Call was for a 10ton AC located in a parking garage about 9 ft in the air. He went in on Sunday, found a leak, repaired and made it ready to fill Monday.

Show up Monday, and the system isnt pressurizing. He's on the ladder im on the ground and we spit balling how to troubleshoot.  At some point he gets on the call with boss and they speaking hindi. When I tried to work with him he said let's talk in the truck I need to focus. No problem,  I get it.

Hours goes by, im bored, on my phone handing him anything he may need but im freaking bored. I yawned twice. This guy goes off on me... ""oh you hate the job, oh you hate me, oh your not my friend"". Im trying to assure him we good, and that I never said I hate the job and trying to politely bring this guy down cuz he clearly relaying his frustration on me.

After 3 min of back and forth, I paused, said ""James your right, this is my fault"" then i proceed to full blow cheering him on like a high-school cheerleader.  J A M E S, gooooooo James, full blown dancing and singing. Bro was fucking shocked. Like bewildered,  confused, and silent. Eventually he just looks at me and says, I dont like that.

No fall out, he tried to make me look bad infront of other colleagues and boss. I just told my side of the story to the office gossiper. Before I knew it, he reached out to apologize with coffee. I rejected all 3 coffee offers. Let's see how long the peace lasts.

This made me hangry and irritable. I was snappy with the lab tech and my husband, but I was self-aware enough to realize I was flirting with a meltdown, so I tried to limit conversation. 

When I got home I really wanted to get a cup of coffee to break my fast, but my husband kept talking to me and pointing out how I was being rude. It’s like he was aware of my behavior, but only in how it made him feel, not because I have meltdowns and lose my sh!t sometimes. I even told him that I was hangry and to please leave me alone, which seemed to irritate him. 

I guess I feel frustrated because I couldn’t keep it together for something so minor. And when I did finally snap, I didn’t remember my plan at all. I had to resist the strong urge to break furniture. I screamed like someone out of control. And I just generally lost it for a few minutes. Thankfully I was alone and not around my husband since he was adding to my stress. 

How do you all remember how to handle your meltdowns when you’re in the middle of it and just want to scream and thrash? And does anyone else feel shame around their meltdowns?

I live near the south west side of Los Feliz and a couple of blocks away from my apartment. I saw a new preferential parking district number 101 go up in the last few weeks. I can see the signs from my apartment roughly but when I try to go and get a permit so I can follow the rules etc etc I’m denied. 

I called in into the city with a genuine curiosity on how I can best comply and I was told that the small area of people essentially got a new district approved even though there wasn’t budget for it and they did this intentionally to ice out the neighbors above Prospect *.

This seems super goofy and antagonizing for all of us neighbors who have to park on the street who live here. The street parking is a pain and our area is super popular with people visiting the restaurants and shops (which we love to see! ) but I’m just trying to understand why such a small area got approved when I was told that no more districts were being approved and it’s so small and it doesn’t cover this whole little section of our neighborhood between Vermont and hillhurst below Franklin  but just these few little blocks below Prospect does anyone have any insight?

I'm not concerned about having a moist puck after the shot but I've noticed the leftover grounds after removing the puck. I've also had channeling during my pull which all resulted in a less than desirable espresso taste. 

I've tried making the grounds slightly more course because my pull times were over 35 seconds on 18g of beans with a yield of 36g of espresso. I have not been able to shake the channeling despite grounding, tapping the portafilter to settle the grounds, WDT tool to break up any clumps, tap it again to clear out air pockets then tamp, throw the basket filter on top than pull. Some channeling has been on the outside of the portafilter but most has been towards the middle. I thought I might have been applying too much pressure when tamping so I've tweaked that along the way. I've also dropped down to 16g of beans with a yield of 24g of espresso (1:1.5 ratio) to see if I can work it out but the shot was bitter. 

Is there anything to learn from consistently leaving grounds behind when clearing the puck? Is there any correlation between channeling and leaving grounds behind? I was using a lighter roast initially and did not have any issues. ",1,1750264586.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I used NasalCrom and the inhaler I was prescribed for same symptoms around Christmas/New Years. Calming a little,  but completely,  yet. ",1,1750264108.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False
1lelk2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SXM/comments/1lelk2w/spending_my_40th_in_saint_martin_would_love/,Spending my 40th in Saint Martin – would love thoughts on our plans!,"Hey everyone! My wife and I (both in our late 30s) are headed to Saint Martin soon to celebrate my 40th. We’re staying in Grand Case and have a private driver arranged for everything (no car rental — we like to drink and not worry about it). This is our first time to the island and we’ve tried to plan a mix of adventure, food, and chill.

We’re not into clubs or loud nightlife. No kids. No dress codes. Just good drinks, good food, relaxed vibes, and maybe making a few vacation friends. Here’s what we’ve lined up:

**Excursions:**

* **Rainforest Adventures “Big 3”** (Flying Dutchman zipline, Sky Explorer lift, and Schooner tube ride) — even though I hate heights, I figured it’s a bucket list thing
* **Topper’s Rhum Distillery** for a tasting tour
* **Boomerang Boat Charter** – Full day to Anguilla with stops at Little Bay, Shoal Bay or Crocus Bay, Prickly Pear Cays, and Meads Bay
* **Scoobi Too Catamaran** – Full day to Tintamarre, Pinel Island, and Creole Rock
* We’re both scuba certified, but I’ve had some equalizing issues so we’ll stick to snorkeling or very shallow dives

**Food & Drinks:**  
We’re all about flavor over flash. In Belize **(**San Pedro), our favorite meals were from roadside stands or hidden local joints (I still crave the ceviche). We’ll splurge on a killer meal if it’s actually worth it, but we’d take lolo BBQ and a cold beer over Instagrammable plating any day.

Spots we’re considering:

* **Sky’s the Limit** and the other lolos
* **Les Fruits de Mer**
* **Rainbow Cafe**
* **Captain Frenchy**
* **Blue Martini**
* **Spiga**
* **Tropics**
* **Barranco** or **L’Auberge Gourmande** for a nicer dinner night
* **Bistrot Caraïbes**
* Always down for great ceviche or beachfront happy hour spots

We’re also planning to stock up at the grocery store on the way to where we're staying in Grand Case — grab some beer, snacks, wine, and breakfast basics. I mostly drink beer, but I’ll lean into wine/cocktails on vacation too. My wife loves seafood, pasta, pastries, and coffee. Neither of us care about “fancy,” and she never wears makeup, so low-key but beautiful places are our thing.

**Other interests:**  
We’re open to museums, history, or any hidden gems that aren’t overly touristy. Also curious about any local favorites or underrated beaches.

If you’ve been recently — any thoughts on:

* Boomerang or Scoobi Too?
* Local beers or drinks to try?
* Grocery store tips (we’re staying in Grand Case)?
* Any restaurants or beach bars you think we shouldn’t miss?

Thanks in advance! Super excited to explore the island. Everybody who we've talked to from SXM has been as nice as they could possibly be. ",6,1750264092.0,SXM,10,1.0,False

Baruti was established by its nose, Spyros Drosopoulos, in 2009. Drosopoulos has a PhD in neuroscience and decided to change fields completely to become a perfumer. He describes himself as self-taught, and besides running Baruti, he also ""creates for other brands and artists, performs live with scent, explores the intersection of AI and perfumery, and teaches the popular Perfume Intensive course at the Institute for Art and Olfaction in L.A."" Baruti is an independent brand and collaborated with and donates to The Red List Project, a nonprofit collective dedicated to the conservation of endangered plant species. (Source: [www.barutiperfumes.com](http://www.barutiperfumes.com/))

**The Fragrances**

The line includes 13 fragrances that are available in both Eau de Parfum and Extrait de Parfum concentrations. I have tried 11 of them, all in EdP concentration, and they're all quite strong with medium sillage, so the Extraits are most likely beasts of immense proportions. The EdPs come in 50ml bottles and the Extraits in 30ml bottles, both priced at 130 euros, which I find to be very agreeable quantities for a reasonable price, especially in this time of obsession with oversized 100ml bottles. A selection of 6 Extraits is also available in travel size (10ml for 55 euros). You also have the option of 3 different discovery sets, which are, in my opinion, decent value for money (25 euros for 5 samples or 55 euros for 13 samples).

I have paid for all my purchases from this brand with my own money and I'm not paid to write this review.



**Voyance**  
*Notes listed: tuberose, guaiac wood, vetiver, sandalwood, musk*

This is described as ""unapologetically gender-queer"" due to the combo of ""ultra feminine"" tuberose and ""ultra masculine"" base of wood and musk. Even though I wanted to try it due to this delightful description, I fell in love with it almost immediately because it smells almost exactly like something my grandparents (now dead for more than 20 years) must have used. Beyond its nostalgic factor, this is floral without being either fresh or overly heavy (even though the opening is quite dusty – not powdery in the cosmetic sense of the word, but dry – like smearing pollen between your fingertips), and has a delightfully vintage vibe. It lightens later on into a lovely smooth woody musk that’s cozy without devolving into a white musk, cheerful without being bland. Kinda like an archetypal French girl, hazy in an old polaroid, with blurry red lips and wearing a starched white shirt with old jeans.



**Berlin im Winter**  
*Notes listed: lavender, mastic oil, rose, iris, cassis, plum, myrrh, frankincense, Irish coffee, NOOUD, amber, leather*

Described as ""boozy, voluptuous and fruity"", this smells quite cold and dark to me. It opens with sort of spicy cassis and develops into cold soft leather with cassis and some incense. The sweetness is kept to a minimum here despite the listed notes of amber and plum. There are occasional whiffs of coffee, but it’s more like opening a jar of coffee grounds, not the freshly brewed stuff. I'm seeing a beautiful woman in black leather, coming in after taking a long walk through a freezing dark city. When she hugs you, you are hit with a voluminous cloud of her cold leather coat’s smell and the cassis perfume she put on before leaving home. Weird and lovely.



**NOOUD**  
*Notes listed: dry oud*

This is the brand's proprietary synthetic dry oud, recommended for layering. I have to mention at this point that I have zero experience with real oud of any kind, so I can't say if this smells like real oud or not. I like it for what it is: a photorealistic, *woody* wood, shifting from a damp pile of fallen logs in the forest all the way to a dark basement filled to the brim with old wooden furniture. Sometimes it leans a bit mouldy, other times it's very dry and sawdusty. It also gets drier the longer you wear it. I love layering this one with Encre Noire to give it some sparkle, but it's great all by itself too, somber and dark.



**Oh My Deer!**  
*Notes listed: black pepper, sichouan pepper, aldehydes, metallic notes, lily of the valley accord, incense, amber, vanilla, soft barnyard accord, tons of musk*

I've only tried this once so far, because the first time was enough for me. It's the brand's take on synthetic recreation of a deer musk, but unlike NOOUD, it's put into a composition. The opening, which lasts for centuries (in real time it's about an hour or so) is something magnificently sweet and powdery, hidden under a thick layer of a hundred years' worth of old piss. If you make an effort and suffer through this, the rest five or six hours of this scent are fabulous, soft, slightly powdery-yet-perfectly-animalic musk. I think this is ultimately a fascinating fragrance, but rather unwearable for me at least - even if I was prepared to suffer through that first hour of horror on a daily basis, I really can't imagine going out into the public wearing this. I really like how this brand handles musk in their scents, but not this one. Big nope from me, do not recommend. You might disagree with me completely - I've read that finding the perfect musk can be an exercise in how much stink one's prepared to suffer through, so this might be exactly the musk for you.



**Perverso**  
*Notes listed: rum, roasted nut, cocoa powder, caramel fudge, fig, tobacco leaf, styrax, musk, ambergris*

Reading the listed notes, you'd think this is a sweet, boozy, cozy winter scent. Instead, it's quite astringent and bitter, austere and somehow green at the same time? The tobacco note is non-sweet - makes me think of tobacco as it's still growing, green and bitter. The booziness is kept to the minimum, but it's also more alcoholic (rather than sweet like rum candy). My fiancee called this one ""like a stanky old smoker's car or a city bus"". Proceed with caution. It's grown on me, though. I wouldn't wear it daily, but it's the first non-sweet tobacco I've tried so far and it has its charms.



**Indigo**  
*Notes listed: mastic oil, hyacinth, rose, frankincense, Atlas cedarwood, sandalwood, NOOUD, amber*

This one is probably the most accessible and likeable scent that I've tried from Baruti so far. It opens really green, quickly shifts into hyacinths and incense, then deepens. There's a woody, resinous, musky base underneath the fresh, dewy, almost \*juicy\* hyacinths that makes this really special. It's just a floral woody scent, but with this inky-blue dark underbelly. Unusual, sort of dirty florals seem to be a bit of a theme with this brand.



**Hot Cotton**  
*Notes listed: hot iron accord, musk*

This fragrance utilises Aldambre, an aromachemical that smells like hot metal. And it really does smell exactly like ironing freshly washed laundry. More specifically, the underarms on cotton shirts and the hot metal of an iron that’s been turned on for a while. The similarity is uncanny. Really more in the category of olfactory art rather than a usable fragrance, it can get overwhelming really quickly – on the other hand, I tried a sneaky spray one evening before bedtime in winter and it transformed under blankets into an incredibly comforting hot laundry scent – kinda like getting into a bed when someone is already in it. Someone you love.



**Chai**  
*Notes listed: cinnamon, cloves, ginger, cardamom, pepper, black tea, steamed milk, cocoa, roses, vanilla, musk, leather*

Does what it says on the tin. Opens very spicy, sweetens, then gets slightly bitter like boiled milk. I think it's a bit too sweet and milky and all-around too cute for me, but it really does smell like a spiced hot milky chai. I don’t get much vanilla or cocoa or roses from it, or any leather at all. It’s all about the spices and the milk. It manages to be sweet without being cloying and it’s not something you’ve smelled a thousand times in the last few years, which is all I ask from a gourmand.



**Dama Koupa**  
*Notes listed: macaroons, iris, osmanthus, musk, amber, white woods, beeswax, fir balsam absolute*

This opens sweet and dry, like the hard shells of almond confetti. There are some very strange, almost stinky florals - I'm guessing osmanthus, which I'm completely unfamiliar with - and a thicker, woody base. It stays sweet all throughout the day. Too sweet for me, although this one is not cloying either, and, just like Chai, it’s definitely distinctive in a sea of sweet vanillas, sweet musks, and sweet caramels.



**Tindrer**  
*Notes listed: cut grass, twigs, wet soil, violets, white musk, ambergris, heliotrope, moss*

You know that distinctive smell that flower shops have? Cut green stems, water, dewy flowers, a bit of soil and fertiliser? That's exactly what this smells like for at least the first hour or two. It's photorealistic to the point that my brain went ""oh, a flower shop"" within the first two sniffs. It calms down later on into a green musk. The late dry down is just a fresh musk and a whole lot less remarkable than the first few hours. Definitely one to try if you like green musks, and it's lovely and really *crispy-green* in the spring and summer as well. You might love it or it might smell like a funeral to you.



**物の哀れ/ Mono No Aware**  
*Notes listed: cherry blossom, matcha tea, Japanese cedarwood, musk*

Very weird. The opening is so bitter and dusty it tickles my throat. Then it gets nutty, sweeter. Later on, a flowery woody musk. Unlike Indigo with its darkness, Tindrer with its green stems and Voyance with its smooth vintage elegance, this one is adorable and translucent. Very interesting and appropriate for spring. Smells like a fragrance for someone who wears a lot of cream linen and likes cherry chapstick.



**Conclusion**  
I've had a total blast with this brand. The scents are strange, vivid, eclectic, like nothing else I've smelled so far. The olfactory aesthetic makes me think of Ann Demeulemeester – sculptural, artistic, lots of luxurious blacks with pops of white, high quality black leather. Simple, but edgy, with sharp edges and interesting textures. I used to think I hated florals before trying these scents, and I can safely say I’m converted. The only complete fail (for me) would be Oh My Deer!, then there are a few weird, very artistic ones (Hot Cotton, Tindrer, Perverso), and a few lovely crowdpleasers (Indigo, Chai, Dama Koupa). My personal favourites are Voyance, NOOUD and Indigo. Give Baruti a try, you won't be bored. The folks over there are lovely as well and the owner very kindly sold me Voyance in travel size (despite the fact that this particular scent isn't available in this size in the shop).

1lelg5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1lelg5j/my_life_for_the_last_6_years/,My life for the last 6 years...,Wednesday June 18th 2025... Wake up.. Shannon is in the bathroom like every other day. Day three now where I have not eaten anything. I go get Ventus from his room and check his diaper. I clean him up put him on the potty for potty time just like I do every other day. Get his breakfast ready do the dishes then feed him breakfast all while getting the house ready for the day which is basically just opening the curtains blinds and letting the dog out back as well as turning the TV on and educational video for Ventus to watch. Shannon finally exits the bathroom makes herself coffee comes and says hi to me and is actually being really nice. She goes into ventus's bedroom because we need to fix his bed frame. Turns out we put something in the wrong spot and we needed to unscrew two pieces and swap them. She starts doing this without my knowledge I noticed and I go try to help. Things are fine at first. I help her with a few screws and once she goes to the other side she already starts getting agitated. I slide her the Allen wrench across the bottom of the bed frame because it would be hard to reach all the way across it or throw it to her the only other option would be getting up and walking all the way around to hand her it. Which now that I think back would have probably been the better option only because it would have annoyed her less but let's be honest she most likely would have found something to get annoyed at regardless. Which she did. She Rose her voice at me and got very angry. Not really out of the norm because this happens almost every day of my life. She talks to me like she really could care less about how she makes me feel. I replied okay in a very exasperated tone kind of sounded like I was sighing. Then she gets even more angry and screams at me at the top of her lungs tells me I can get out she doesn't need my help. I'm just curious if this is any kind of appropriate response. Should people speak to their spouse this way? Also if the roles were reversed and I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and spoke to her the way I did would it be acceptable? Or would I be labeled an emotionally abusive boyfriend? Because right now I kind of seems like I'm being emotionally abused and if she is so concerned with my body language and the vibe of what I'm saying why can't she understand how she makes me feel with how she just straight up speaks to me? I'm very patient I'm very kind I try to be as helpful as possible I'm basically her Butler live in servant and I do everything she asks and then some. Our child is 5 years old and he's still in diapers and is still nonverbal and he's about to transition to kindergarten. She barely spends any time with him I have to go out of my way to spend time with him which I've basically given up the entire last 5 years of my life for. But to be fair I'm also not working and I haven't been working for the last like 2 years. Shannon works from home doing back-end internet support and she makes very good money doing so. This means she's able to take care of the bills and everything we need without even needing to leave her house. So in return I try to do everything I can to supplement support. I potty train our son everyday I do reading and writing activities with him and we watch educational videos together and I try to get him to mimic what they do in those videos to help his speech development. The responsibilities I have at home outweigh the responsibilities she has at work. Half of the time while she's at work she's just waiting for a call to come in for someone who needs help with commercial internet support. So basically she's sitting on her ass for 8 hours a day and four to five of those hours are mostly her watching videos on her tablet or playing games well she waits for calls to come in. I know this because I was working at a similar company in a remote position a few years ago doing the same thing but having to take care of my son while working. Because she developed this habit where if something needs to be done she will just let it sit way past the time that would be considered acceptable in getting it done or taking care of it. For example she never takes her dishes cups balls or anything she uses to eat or drink back into the kitchen when she's done with it. She literally waits until I get up to get a drink or to get a snack or just help our kid with something. Because then I feel obligated to do it because I'm already getting up. Maybe it's my fault she's like this. She takes advantage of me because I allow her to. I've realized this in the past and I've tried taking precautionary measures and all it did was make my life even more miserable. She weaponizes her emotions and gaslights me into thinking that I'm the one in the wrong when I'm just trying to get my point across. She ignores her own toxic behavior and blames me for how I react. She's done this for the last like 5 years ever since the baby was born in fact she did this when she was pregnant with him so even before he was born. So I really don't know what to do I'm trying my best to make the situation better but it seems like it's only temporarily better and then it gets even worse when it happens again. I think that's a part of her tactic. She acts like everything's normal and she loves me so much love bombing me and making me feel like I'm the most important thing in her world. But then as soon as a small little tiny aspect of stress hits her emotional state she completely erupts and I'm the only thing in her crosshairs because I'm the only one here. She can't take it out on the kid because he's 5 years old and doesn't even understand what anyone is saying. She tries to do that but she doesn't get any emotional satisfaction out of it. She likes when I react to her toxic behavior so she has a reason to blame me for why she's reacting the way she is. ,1,1750263840.0,ToxicRelationships,1,0.67,False

The product quality has gone downhill and the software support (especially G Hub) is lackluster at best and not functional at other times. After issues with headsets, mice, and software, I'm hanging it up for other brands.  
  
My first webcam was a Logitech. My first wireless keyboard was a Logitech. I've been an avid consumer of Logitech and LogitechG products over the years. I used a G710+ -- two different ones -- for 12 years or more. It was still functioning properly until I spilled an entire cup of coffee on it.

I currently own:

* G502 Lightspeed Mouse (Desktop)
* G305 Lightspeed Mouse (Laptop)
* G935 Wireless Headset (Desktop)
* G710+ Keyboard (up until the coffee incident)
* Logitech 1080p webcam

I recently returned the G915 keyboard and opted for a Razer Blackwidow v4.

In the last 2 years, I've had the following issues:

* My G935 headset switch is loose and always has been. I have to ""jimmy"" it to get it to work. It works if it's in the right spot, but it's not as simple as an On/Off switch because the On has to be ""on in the right way.""
* My G502 ""wireless"" mouse just doesn't work wirelessly anymore. The receiver is simple not working. I've been using it wired for 18+ months.
* Logitech G Hub just sucks and often doesn't work. And this has clearly been an ongoing issue that remains unaddressed.
   * See here, 8 months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/1geq8d5/i\_have\_never\_hated\_a\_software\_as\_much\_as\_i\_hate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/1geq8d5/i_have_never_hated_a_software_as_much_as_i_hate/)
   * See here, 2 years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/17fyk8x/logitech\_ghub\_app\_is\_the\_worst\_application\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/17fyk8x/logitech_ghub_app_is_the_worst_application_ever/)
   * See here, also 2 years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/16ovgh4/why\_is\_ghub\_the\_worst\_software\_in\_history\_for\_10/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/16ovgh4/why_is_ghub_the_worst_software_in_history_for_10/)
* The G915 keyboard just left a lot to be desired, especially for the price point. That's why I returned it and went with a Razer.

I was a avid Logitech fan and I always recommended them to gamers and general users alike. But I can no longer do this in good conscience and I am actively switching away from Logitech / LogitechG for future purchases.

I'm not sure if it's cutting corners or not investing in the right people or resources, but it's been a massive disappointment for the last 3+ years.

I kept hoping it would get better, but it's time to divorce Logitech.

1leldqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1leldqv/is_22g_of_carbs_high_for_breakfast/,Is 22g of carbs high for breakfast?,"I am currently 29w4 days. I was diagnosed at 11 weeks and definitely took granted how easy it was the first 15 or so weeks to be diet controlled. 

Now I’m having a hard time with all the things the used to work for me but aren’t anymore. My daily morning breakfast which wouldn’t even put me over 110 was: 2 scrambled eggs (0 carbs), 1 fairlife protein shake mixed with 1/2 a can of a cold brew latte (10 carbs), and 3 Belveta so I’m not just drowning in protein (27 carbs). On mornings when I was up early with my toddlers I’d just have the belveta’s and the protein coffee - no eggs. Still no issue. Or I’d be able to have all the above and swap out the Belveta for a whole grain English muffin with PB, probably an equal carb count. 

Then I stopped being able to have the protein coffee and Belveta without having the eggs to offset.

Then I was still getting high-ish but not a spike numbers from eggs and the protein coffee. So I cut the coffee part thinking maybe that’s making things wonky. But this morning I had eggs, just the fairlife and only TWO belveta for a total of 22 carbs and I got a fucking 157. I’m so frustrated. And feeling lame for the fact that it must seem like I’m still trying to stick a square peg in a round hole by wanting to hold on to these dang belvetas. But like before this never would have spiked me. My fasting this morning was already 95 so that sucks to have two spikes right in a row. 

How do you manage a breakfast with like no carbs. I mean a fairlife still has 4 carbs but if I just eat eggs and a drink a fairlife every morning for the next 9 weeks I might go crazy. ",4,1750263674.0,GestationalDiabetes,14,1.0,False

Looking to meet new people from around the world, need someone to vent to or just kill time with? I’m your guy","Hey there and thanks for reading! I’m a 28 year old from the U.K. Looks wise, I’m 6’1, with a slim build, brown hair, blue eyes, nothing too unusual. Looking to get to know new people and make new friends, long term if we click! I currently work as a technician. I’m into the usual boring/lazy stuff: drinking, coffee, music, films, gaming etc. Would be cool if we shared similar hobbies however it’s not the end of the world, I’m a good listener so I’m always here to listen to your rants if you just need to get something off your chest. I’m  also a cat person! Mexican food is the best kind of food! Followed by Italian. If you want to get to know me better (or see what I look like) just shoot me a message!

What I’m looking for: Someone who is capable of actually keeping a conversation going back and forth i.e not reminiscent of talking to a brick wall and someone who is capable of taking a joke. Fast replies are also a plus! Drinking buddies always welcome ;)",0,1750263616.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
