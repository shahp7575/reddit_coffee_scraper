My parents have decided to move to Greensboro, along with all of my siblings (7 of them, all younger, most still in school so they don't have much choice). I'm very close with my family, and I would consider making the move with them, but we're nervous about moving to a red state. My wife is from Wyoming (and her family is still there) and she left for a reason.

I am hoping we can talk to some gay couples in Greensboro to learn what your experience is like, especially married couples with children, as we are planning to grow our family within the next few years. What do you like about living there, how concerned are you about the future, are you much more concerned now than you were a few months ago?

We're not worried about finding community - we know we can do that anywhere. And we're not worried about living near republican voters - we know we can find a way to get along with most people. What we're worried about is the state-level politics, especially long term as things get worse, and our future children.

I would really like to hear some perspectives on this from any queer people in or from the area. We have a trip planned to Greensboro for the last weekend in March to see it for ourselves and get a sense of the place. We would love to meet up with another couple (especially parents!) for coffee or something to chat in person as well.",1,1738426132.0,gso,0,1.0,False
1if9jzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1if9jzz/braun_kf7150bk_review_honest_thoughts_after_daily/,Braun KF7150BK review honest thoughts after daily use,"The Braun KF7150BK BrewSense 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker has become a staple in my kitchen over the past few weeks. I’m the kind of person who needs coffee to function, so my coffee maker is practically my lifeline. This machine has its quirks, but it’s won me over with its sleek design and solid brewing capabilities. Every morning starts with the satisfying hum of this coffee maker, and I’ve put it through its paces to see how it holds up over time.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The Braun KF7150BK manages to look both modern and classic, with its stainless steel and piano black finish. It’s compact enough to sit on my counter without feeling like it’s hogging the space, which I appreciate since my kitchen isn't exactly massive. However, while the exterior looks premium, the internal parts are mostly plastic, which feels a bit underwhelming. The carafe itself is lightweight but veers on the side of feeling fragile. I’ve had to handle it with care, especially in my morning pre-coffee haze. The buttons are intuitive and have a nice tactile feel, making it easy to operate even when I’m half asleep.

**Brewing Performance**  
This is where the Braun KF7150BK shines. It heats quickly and brews a full pot of coffee in a reasonable time. The PureFlavor system ensures that the coffee is brewed at just the right temperature, and I can genuinely taste the difference compared to my old coffee maker. I’ve played around with the 1-4 cup setting for smaller batches, which works well, although I find myself brewing the full 12 cups more often than not. My favorite feature, hands down, has to be the anti-drip system. Being able to grab a cup mid-brew without making a mess is a game changer!

**Coffee Flavor**  
Let’s talk coffee. The Braun KF7150BK delivers a rich, smooth cup every time. I’ve tested it with various coffee grounds, from budget grocery store brands to more expensive specialty beans, and it consistently produces great results. I particularly appreciate the strength control feature, which lets me tweak the flavor depending on my mood. My partner, who likes their coffee on the lighter side, also loves this feature. It’s nice to finally have a coffee maker that doesn’t make me feel like I’m drinking flavored water on those days I need a stronger brew.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning is a bit of a mixed bag. While the parts are dishwasher-safe, which is a win for lazy days, the black water reservoir can be tricky to inspect. I’ve found myself squinting to make sure there aren’t any hard water stains or residue. There’s a built-in descaling feature, but I haven’t had to use it yet. The reusable gold-tone filter is eco-friendly and does a decent job, but it does let some fine silt through. If you’re picky about that, you might want to stick to paper filters.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish design that fits nicely on countertops
* PureFlavor system ensures consistent brewing temperature
* Strength control feature for customizable coffee flavor
* Anti-drip system for mess-free mid-brew pours
* Dishwasher-safe components for easy cleanup

**Cons**

* Internal parts and carafe feel a bit too lightweight and fragile
* Black water reservoir makes it hard to inspect for cleanliness
* No battery backup for the clock; settings reset if unplugged
* Gold-tone filter allows some fine grounds to seep through
* Slightly noisier than expected during brewing

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to the Cuisinart DCC-3200, the Braun KF7150BK holds its ground with its PureFlavor system and anti-drip feature. However, the Cuisinart offers a sturdier build and a larger capacity, making it a better choice for households needing more coffee in one go. On the other hand, if you’re looking at budget-friendly options like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable, the Braun outperforms in flavor and brewing consistency but comes at a higher price point. Another contender, the Bonavita BV1900TS, boasts a superior stainless steel design but lacks the Braun’s intuitive features like strength control.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While the Braun KF7150BK isn’t the cheapest coffee maker out there, it does justify its cost with premium brewing features and a solid performance in the flavor department. If you’re someone who values consistent, great-tasting coffee and doesn’t mind the occasional quirk, I’d say it’s worth the investment. However, if durability is a top priority, you might want to explore alternatives.

This coffee maker comes with a range of features that cater to both casual coffee drinkers and enthusiasts. The programmable clock is a handy addition, but the lack of battery backup feels like a missed opportunity. I’m a fan of the warming plate with adjustable temperature settings, which keeps my coffee hot without scorching it. It’s these little touches that make the Braun KF7150BK stand out in a crowded market.

Was having an episode once, sometimes twice a week, would be out for at least 5 hours with my face in a pillow just riding it out. Through some rather synchronistic events, I had decided to quit coffee and substituted Cacao with Shelejit every morning. My intuition was telling me that the coffee every morning, being a diuretic, was stripping me of essential minerals and not allowing me to hold on to whatever nutrients i was getting from my food. 

The high mineral content of Cacao, Shilajit, and also adding minerals to my water supply has me feeling like I have a whole new lease on life. I wake up with tons of energy and my libido is also super healthy ;)

Hope this may help someone out there. The caffein in coffee was never the issue and I had taken a week break before, but it needed longer than that, plus I really needed to up my mineral content since I was so low.  ",1,1738426054.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

I've been in this line of business for many years now and have made many connections.

I would like to begin wholesaling on a miniature scale due to my lack of funds (around 10k). I just don't know what to sell. it would have to be something with a fast turnover rate and decently profitable but not too expensive because I have to continue paying bills out of the 10k that I have saved up.

I know I should ideally have more funds and I am in the process of looking for a new job in order to save up more money and build up my risk tolerance, but I want to use the time between now and then to try something out and see if it kicks off. I have a customer base and sales skills, just don't have a product.

I was thinking Piñata's but I think that would require more money upfront and I don't think it's something that sells quickly. Maybe it's something to hold off on until further down the line when I'm more established.

I also thought about coffee beans but there are a lot of regulations around consumables and I'd rather not get into that space unless I know it's going to be profitable. From what I've read online, though, coffee isn't very profitable. I'm going to do more research, though.

Also, I have access to a warehouse where I can receive and store pallets and they regularly get shipments from Miami and Houston so if there is anything that needs to be shipped in from those areas, I can make it happen fairly easily.

If anyone has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate it and sorry if it seems like my writing is all over the place, I have a lot on my mind right now.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Some months ago, I (26 male) went for a casual drink with some colleagues in a bar after work. One of them, say, Dave (30 male), has always had a strange issue with me. I never understood why; perhaps jealousy, perhaps just simple pettiness. He used to pass all sorts of uncalled-for comments on me, would take one opportunity or another to belittle me in front of management, and one time just spilled coffee by ""accident"" on my work laptop.  

Anyway, that night, I ordered a gin and tonic and left it on the table for a while. I stepped out for a second, came back, and the drink tasted off-like chemical off. I spat it out immediately, and at first thought I guess the bartender had put something weird in it. Then my throat began to burn, and my stomach felt like it was flipping inside out.  

To cut a long story short, I went to the hospital, where their tests proved that my system contained traces of pesticide.Actual. Pesticide.  

Security footage from the bar (God bless good camera systems) showed Dave tampering with my drink while I was away. Turns out, he had a tiny bottle of insecticide in his pocket. What kind of psycho carries that?  

I went ahead, filed charges against him. He got arrested and dismissed from work at once. Then came the lawsuit. I sued for damages, medical expenses, and emotional distress. The defense? ""It was a prank. I didn't mean to make it serious."" The judge didn't buy any of it.  

Won: £15K.

I really would prefer peace of mind to the money, but at least there was some justice. As for Dave?

What it actually means is that the sign's nature struggles to express itself in a harmonious and natural way - making it less beneficial for the native. I find Mercury to be the most interesting example (followed by the moon and Saturn).

Mercury rules intellect, communication and knowledge - it's very concrete, detail oriented and ""matter of fact"". It's the least comfortable in Sagittarius and Pisces, because they view knowledge as pieces of the puzzle, striving to put them together and expand. Jupiter rules higher education and wisdom, which is in conflict with Mercurian energy - it asks ""why"" rather than asking ""how"". Jupiterian Mercury signs often struggle communicating their ideas, because it's too abstract and deep for the majority to comprehend. I'm a Capricorn Mercury, but having it in 9th house and in conjunction with Jupiter and Neptune, I LOVE listening to people with Mercury in Pisces or Sag. I find it fascinating, enlightening and rewarding.

My favorite interview with Jimi Hendrix, who had a Sagittarius Mercury, is one where he talks about money. He says young artists often lose their creativity and identity when they get successful. He then goes on to make an analogy about how if you, for example, drink coffee everyday, you're gonna stop enjoying it. It's gonna become a need and a habit, something you don't think about but can't live without - and would have been just as happy and more in control if you wouldn't have let it turn into that. I find that to be a perfectly sensible analogy, but the interviewer just laughed and replied ""I don't know, but it sounds good"". Jupiterians focus on philosophy and higher truths, put things in larger perspective and often speak in metaphors because of this... Making people struggle with understanding them a lot of the time. It makes them less practical and detail focused - but less logical and analytical? Nah. I'd say it's the opposite.

Isaac Newton was a Sag Mercury, and Galileo Galilei was a Pisces Mercury. Their philosophical approach and natural way of trying to put things in perspective, question the things labelled as ""facts"", and ask why things are the way they are is what led to their discoveries. 

""I know how this particular apple fell from the tree, but WHY did it fall?"" - Newton

""I know we see colors, but WHY do we see them?"" - Newton

""I know all astronomers claim the earth is the center of the Universe, and that all known information is based off of that... But WHY do we believe that? What's the meaning behind the things I view through my telescope?"" - Galileo Galilei 

I find this really interesting... Saturn is my only planet at fall, and I don't have any planets in detriment or exaltation at all. But as a Capricorn Mercury, I've been wondering why the wisest Sagittarians often have their Mercury in Sag as well... And why one of the top 3 smartest and most analytically gifted people I've ever met has her Mercury in Pisces. ",3,1738425459.0,astrologymemes,1,1.0,False

I've been in this line of business for many years now and have made many connections.

  
I would like to begin wholesaling on a miniature scale due to my lack of funds. I just don't know what to sell. it would have to be something with a fast turnover rate and decently profitable but not too expensive because I have to continue paying bills out of the 10k that I have saved up.

  
I know I should ideally have more funds and I am in the process of looking for a new job in order to save up more money and build up my risk tolerance, but I want to use the time between now and then to try something out and see if it kicks off. I have a customer base and sales skills, just don't have a product. 

  
I was thinking Piñata's but I think that would require more money upfront and I don't think it's something that sells quickly. Maybe it's something to hold off on until further down the line when I'm more established. 

  
I also thought about coffee beans but there are a lot of regulations around consumables and I'd rather not get into that space unless I know it's going to be profitable. From what I've read online, though, coffee isn't very profitable. I'm going to do more research, though. 

  
Also, I have access to a warehouse where I can receive and store pallets and they regularly get shipments from Miami and Houston so if there is anything that needs to be shipped in from those areas, I can make it happen fairly easily. 

  
If anyone has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate it and sorry if it seems like my writing is all over the place, I have a lot on my mind right now.

Honestly, I've yet to find something that I feel works better in the YA space. (If you have a rec or the pitch reminds you of anything, please let me know! I'd love to at least give it a read.) 

  
And without further ado: 

  
Dear \[Agent\], 

I hope this letter finds you well. CITY OF DREAMS is a standalone YA fantasy novel with series potential, complete at 94,000 words. Perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo’s *Six of Crows,* it blends the delectable underworld from Hafsah Faizal’s *A Tempest of Tea* with the masterful deception in Lauren Robert’s *Powerless.* 

In everchanging Salkesh, not only dreams but nightmares weave the world—and, with public safety to consider, nightmares are a felony, even if sparked by someone else’s mistake. 

18-year-old Kali Lozano has weathered six long years on the volatile streets of Salkesh with only her best friend as refuge. Tired of gigs gone wrong, Kali accepts her friend’s ultimatum: she’ll leave her underground life behind, but first, she just needs to ditch the stolen goods she’s stashed under their bed. Before she can, her best friend’s fear for Kali’s safety blossoms into a nightmare, and both of them are caught in the fallout. 

As Kali finally faces the consequences of her schemes, she hungers for the one object that might get her out of this mess: the public ledger. The ledger is a living record of each of Salkesh’s secrets and sins. With it, she’d learn exactly where to find her apprehended best friend—and how to finally bury her lies for good.

Kali sheds her skin once more and infiltrates a secret society of dreamwalking mages, masquerading as one of their own. They have a plan to heist the public ledger, but it hinges entirely on Kali’s so-called magic. She’s soon ensnared by the secrets that linger in the society’s halls and a growing love for her intoxicating mentor and newfound home. If she can’t keep her true identity contained, she’ll not only lose the family she never thought she’d have, but watch any chance of finding her best friend slip right through her deft hands.

By day, I am a psychology student at \[Mexican University\] and a \[REDACTED\], where my time involves medical writing and editing articles. Nestled in the mountains in \[REDACTED\], I can be found with a cat on my lap and coffee in hand. Like Kali, I am both autistic and Latinx (Salvadoran-Canadian), and I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community. Thank you for your time and consideration.

When we got to the concert, we found our seats and I knew they would play Ho Hey early on (because they’re the best band ever, and they don’t make you wait), and as soon as they opened with Cleopatra, I thought, “maybe I should run to the bathroom now before Ho Hey comes on”.

I'm a recent graduate Pakistani guy living in the UK and due to start work in few months for context. After all the nightmare stories I heard online and on this sub, I've decided I have to get to know a potential spouse before marrying, ideally for about 6 months. 

In my family circles the general protocol is families meet, maybe the couple get food or coffee once together, and then exchange phone numbers after engagement(which can't be broken cos 'what will people say'). That's nowhere near enough time for me. I told my mum, I want to meet any potential spouse at least 10-15 times before deciding. She was like 'ok so you want to be like white people that just become friends and have a relationship and never marry?!' then she said becoming 'friends' before marriage is haram. I tried to tell her that it's only desi culture where you guys treat marriage like a gamble with just one meeting. Arabs, Malaysians or any other culture lets their kids get to know each other, but she didn't believe me. 

Am I tripping, do arabs, turks, north africans or any other muslim culture not allow getting to know one another and 'becoming friends' before marriage like my mum says? 

My mum told me 'no decent family will ever let their daughter just talk for ten meetings'. Also, she keeps bugging me to consider my cousin even though I told her no a million times. How should I deal with this in future. Of course, I will try to avoid the conversation in a respectful way as much as possible, and eventually move out so I have more independence. Apart from that, is there anything else I can do? Is there a way to make her see my pov too or is she too rigid? I would be open to arranged route if I felt I had enough agency to make my own choice but it doesn't seem like it's going to be that way. So I will probably try the apps or something once I move out and start working. Sure apps are terrible but at least it will be my own choice that matters there.

So we have been together for almost one year and i moved to live with her about half a year ago. Some maybe red flags? or yellow flags started appearing and im not sure if am weird about it or is she...  
So for instance, she was living with male  roomate who is approximately 10 years younger than her before i moved in with her and for some more time also when i arrived, before he moved out. There was some strange interaction between two of them, and she was always saying that he is like a small brother she never had. For instance when she went to work she said i love you to me and then also i love you to him but then added ""like a brother i mean"". ... isnt that little weird? Also they went dancing together (not together but same event - extatic dance) and they have this humour together that i dont really get it. They also sometimes talk in Portugal  which i dont understand, but they do (as he is from there and she get to know the language by travelling). Also at beginning when i told her that it makes me a little uncomfortable that she is livng with this guy that she already asked him once if she is his type and he said no -  that was like an evidence that he is not interested in her ... i mean, what to say, thanks for telling me that! There were also some other things that were weird happening between them but i said ok, i never blamed her to much about it and believed her what she said, that he is just like a fun little brother to her. He moved away anyway soon.

Than there were another things ...for instance, we had an argument a month ago when she mentioned that next day she is going for a coffee with this guy that she hasnt seen for 10 years and were really good friends in the past, to catch up. Later at dinner she said that she is going to sleep over at her female friend tomorrow that was having some emotional troubles because of her ex and I just calmly continued witout missing a beat ""or at that friend you said?"" ... and then she exploded hysterically, how can i even suggest that, that im implying that she is lying, etc.  I asked her why do you need to yell, I was just very very calm and listened and said ok im going out until you calm down. And then when i returned i said that im not going to be in relationship with somebody who shows disrespect with yelling like crazy, and she was apologising then for the whole day. Also when we talked more about that ""date""- that is what i was saying to her that for me that is a date if you get together with somebody of opposite sex just to ""catch up"" , without any connection to work or anything - maybe i exaggarated here a little bit? But then i asked her what was her relationship with him in the past and she said they dated just a little bit, but were just very good friends afterwards.  And when i asked her if she ever had sex with him she said that she cant remember!? Also at this time she said that she is also Bisexual and asked me so im not allowed now to go with any girls out? And i said this is not the matter, the thing is that i wonder where you are putting your priorities and always saying you dont have time for everything but then you go out to everything you are invited to, or just for some coffee dates with your exes - she studies, works, and then also has time to meet with all those different people? So then I asked her how would it feel if the situation was turned around, and she threatened me a little bit  ""you better not do that just to revenge""  but otherways she said it would be ok for her if i do that...  and that was kind of it. For me the issue was more about her hysterical reaction of course paired with the situation. She was apologising. Also she said she will cancel the meeting for the next day with this guy but she will meet some other time with him (i never demanded that - she was saying im guilt tripping her). And i said that is not a problem to me, priority for me is that you are honest and to have a normal conversation around ""sensitive"" topics.

I think i was never a controlling or jealous type, but maybe im becoming one - or maybe there is a reason for me to be this way? Its also weird that she said at least 2 of her ex were were jealous types and she doesnt want to repeat that (HMM). Thats all i can say for now but i would appreciate and advice around this topic!

Also i'm sorry for any grammar mistakes because english is not my first language

Two months ago i turned 30 and i wasn't happy at all, In fact i was in deep psychological dysphoria because i started to think my so far life. I feel like i wasted my twenties (twenties are very important years for people to become more mature, have experiences and learn skills)

I am autistic with adhd and i believe because of these two conditions i developed dysthymia, cptsd and social anxiety since i was still a child (not officially diagnosed but i relate to most symptoms of these conditions). My five conditions went untreated

I tried to ""fix"" my social anxiety with the most easy to find drug ""alcohol"" and that wasn't the best idea because it led me to have alcohol problem

Since i was 16 and mostly at my 20 and later i was drinking alcohol so i could be comfortable with people and loud environments

I love this kind of numbness/euphoria alcohol gives me I am more relaxed, comfortable, energized and social I can being touched or listening to loud sudden noises without me jumping and startling in fear

My parents are good people, i know they love me, i still live with them, but that doesn't mean they weren't traumatized me. I guess they didn't know other way to raise me as a child and teenager other than being physically and mentally abusive when i was naughty or didn't listening to them and when they caughted me masturbating

Also they were emotional neglectful too because i guess that's only they knew from their parents

Even though they treat me better now i still kinda afraid of them (especially my mother because she was the most strict one). I afraid to tell them my feelings and thoughts or whatever. I afraid that they will criticize me or look at me with disappointment I get triggered and anxious many times even if i'm in the same room with them so i close myself in my room all the time

I believe i wasted my twenties because i couldn't get a single degree, i didn't have motivation, i was so bored that felt pointless to continue, i couldn't focus, i had brain fog and i was afraid failure.

Because of my extreme shyness, self-loathing and fear i never had a job Everyone around me think i'm lazy, i don't know if they right or not but it's difficult to do something if it's really boring, i need something to stimulate my brain, coffee helps even temporary sometimes

I believe i wasted my twenties because i could have done sex, so far i had done it 2 times, while being drunk because of my anxiety, but i wanted more.

Mentally i'm extreme shy and scared but my body needs intimacy and sex by a lot of partners. I try to satisfy my sexual urges and desires through masturbation and fantasies. I'm so jealous of other women who have the courage to actively have sex whenever they want with different men.

I believe i wasted my twenties because i didn't take care my appearance that much but i guess i can now because 30 years old is still young i guess But still i feel like i wasted my youth, so many opportunities and experiences

I posted here last year regarding leukoplakia, chronic illness, “MCAS”, POTS, etc. After various tests, long years of nausea, skin flushing, hives, near fainting, weight loss, neuropathy symptoms starting with tingling hands/feet, what I know understand is thrush of my mouth from dry mouth…my ANA panel came back 1:160 positive for anti-Ro/SSA negative for the rest of the panel including SSB/La. I can see why my post got shared last year, MCAS sounds strange looking back, but not having answers, you go crazy. Then you have more similar symptoms at 23 to lupus, cannot stay awake and have no life past 8pm and have joint pain like a 60 year old and asked be re-tested for auto-immunes.

Anyways, I had a hospitalization in Dec 2023 that included spiked WBC, potassium, sodium and monocyte count. My glucose spiked to 154 and I couldn’t hold anything down and vomited for 5 days straight. My eGFR went from 89-134-91 within those 5 days. I had scopes completed there because of my heart rate reaching 30-40, low high BP (130-140), thickening of my gallbladder and intestines seen on CT. Nothing was found besides increased WBC cells. Endoscopy/colonoscopy next month revealed no celiac or chrons. The skin symptoms progressed with rashes to nothing, leading to the MCAS reasoning, etc…heart monitor showed arrhythmias and I cannot walk up the stairs any longer without almost fainting. I try to move and exercise but I cannot do it. It’s heartbreaking as a past athlete. I had a positive EBV+ test for a prior infection (but no current one) in 10/2023.

My last appointment 12/2024, eGFR 74 and creatinine bumped, calcium bumped, everything else is low. No worries, but I cannot pee. I have barely any appetite, thirst and the urinary emptying can take 2-10 minutes even if I’m completely full. To keep my stream going is so hard — for sure kidney concerns.

Doctor did not take me seriously for any lupus/autoimmune concerns until my ANA panel came back. I’ve never felt so cold in my life until the -20 wind chill days and at my visit on 1/24/2025, my temp taken was 95.5 and glucose 49, eGFR 74 still and creatinine bumped to 1.08, so not high, but same levels as month prior. I couldn’t warm up for almost a week. I almost took myself to the hospital after my visit at the doctors, but I went into work. Didn’t see my labs until almost 5. I drank tea and ate some bread before my appointment. So the glucose scared me. 

I went home, no call from the office. Following day, the 25th, I was going crazy. I couldn’t feel my core. I was so cold, exhausted. I felt like I was dying. I try to eat and drink but I felt so unmotivated and not hungry. My friend came over, bundled me up and forced coffee (decaf), food and sleep into me but a watchful eye after I said I couldn’t feel warm and shared with her my results. The temperature concerned her. 

I took it at home and it was normal-ish, I’ve been in the 97 range for a bit now. Maybe a year. But I couldn’t feel warm in certain parts of my arms, legs or feet for a few days. I’ve never had the cold effect me like this and I’ve lived in the Midwest and experienced MUCH colder before. I’m scared for myself. I called nurse triage who checked my chart, had me on the phone for 40 minutes, said it’s not concerning but strange why they wouldn’t retake my temp and if I felt worse, go to the ER. But she’d have my doctor call me Monday since I didn’t feel well after my appointment still.

He messaged me via the portal. But after the positive ANA after years of denial, the labs and having to what felt like nurse myself back to health after being told to basically avoid the ER because nothing sounded new and could wait for the rheumatic doctors also in May, I was shocked. I’ve never had glucose issues so when it said my doctor was notified when I saw the chart, I was confused. Is 49 bad?? I ate which is what scared me. I haven’t responded to my doctor, I just feel slighted. I still don’t feel great but it’s been about a week or so since then so obviously…I’m okay. Still just my sjogrens symptoms and I’m a bit cold but I think I got myself back to “baseline”. But what next steps should I take knowing this and that my glucose keeps fluctuating? 


Edit to add: the worst of my current symptoms are muscle twitches, urinary emptying issues, nausea during arousal of any kind (sexual, anger, etc.), tingling of fingers/hands/toes (can make them unusable), complete swelling of hands and feeling which feels like they’re going to explode, I call them my bear paws in the morning when they feel so tight. Diarrhea, sweating, flushes in relation to anything and itching under my armpits. The dry eyes and mouth also sucks — I now am going to try ProKera. Needless to say it’s progressed very quickly and my PCP informed me that at rheumatology, they may do vaccines and start immunosuppressants. I just don’t know what any of this means or what the blood labs even indicate. ",1,1738423367.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Jason and Emily had been together for five years before deciding to part ways. Their relationship had its ups and downs, but ultimately, they grew apart. Despite breaking up, they convinced themselves that their strong bond could survive as friends.

At first, everything seemed fine. They would catch up over coffee, share life updates, and even joke about their past relationship. Jason started dating other women, and Emily acted as his ""friend"" and occasional wingwoman. She assured him that she was happy for him, but deep down, jealousy simmered beneath the surface.

Then Emily met Ryan. He was charming, confident, and completely different from Jason. As their relationship deepened, she noticed that Jason’s friendly attitude began to change. He became passive-aggressive, constantly making snide remarks about Ryan. When she posted a picture with Ryan on social media, Jason responded with a sarcastic comment: ""Wow, looks like you finally found someone who can tolerate your late-night ramblings.""

Emily brushed it off, but things got worse. One night, Jason showed up unannounced at a party where she and Ryan were. He was drunk and confrontational, making indirect jabs that left everyone uncomfortable. Later, Emily confronted him, asking why he was acting this way.

Jason finally admitted, ""I thought we could be friends, but seeing you with someone else makes me realize I never really moved on.""

That was the moment Emily realized their ""friendship"" was a lie. They weren’t staying friends because they were mature or strong enough—it was because they were afraid of letting go.

In the end, Emily made the painful decision to cut ties completely. Jason was heartbroken but knew it was for the best. They both learned a valuable lesson: staying friends with an ex might seem like a good idea, but sometimes, it's just delaying the inevitable heartbreak.
""Is staying friends with an ex a sign of maturity, or does it only lead to more heartbreak?""

So I have become an espresso lover over the years, as one does, and my lovely husband purchased me a bambino plus for the holidays. I was so excited and got a bunch of lil fun additions and gadgets. Bottomless portafilter, scale, a shelf and knock box all the lil things. I even splurged and got myself the Turin DF54.

I even signed up for Atlas coffee club. My fear is once the grinder gets here, the measuring, grind size, dialing in part overwhelms me. Should I get more things? How do I know how much in beans to grind? Is this just something I troubleshoot till I’m happy? Can my Turin grinder get the grounds as fine as the equator coffee comes?

Jesus Christ, this case happened 7 years before 9/11, this poor woman died the year I was born, and her memory lives on mostly as a punchline, just because she needed money for her (outlandish, but that's another rant) medical expenses.

Tell me how your week was, what was the highlight, who's that person at work that really annoys you, lol. If you can have some strange and supernatural weirdness that goes on in your area, would love to hear about it.

In terms of my interests, I like music of all kinds, horror, sci-fi, and fantasy in all its media forms, I also like being outdoors. Also enjoy learning different languages, and learning how to play music. Honestly I find a little bit of everything at least a little bit interesting so we can chat about whatever you like, hope to hear from some of you soon!",0,1738422848.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False

I am currently taking stimulant medication and have ruled out from non-stimulant medication. I was advised not to take any caffeine as the effectiveness of the adhd stimulants may be reduced. I’ve been feeling super tired even while taking lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) 10 mg. I felt super energetic while taking caffeine before I was diagnosed and ever since I stopped taking caffeine, I felt super tired and just never able to produce much results. I am just bland. 

I was wondering, after observing that many users and people drink coffee while on stimulants. How is that even possible? Would that even be safe? 

Are there ways/hacks to get energy while taking stimulants despite feeling super tired? 

Hours of sleep are average, water intake is good, vitamins (all) are being taken. Yes, even the L-Tyrosine. 

How would I even boost to effectiveness of the stimulant? I understand protein may help, which I have taken during but nothing helps. I tried eating 2 hours after taking stimulants, one hour, and 30 minutes—which all produce no difference. ",2,1738422537.0,adhdwomen,6,1.0,False

1if8895,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/1if8895/a_reflection_on_my_gray_pc_experience/,A reflection on my gray PC experience,"Before joining the Peace Corps, I scoured Reddit, searching for glimpses into the lives of other volunteers. I found blogs meticulously documenting entire services, from their first bewildered months at site to their tearful COS posts. I filtered through the polished Peace Corps-curated narratives, gravitating toward the stories of volunteers in Latin America, particularly those in the Health and Youth in Development sector, trying to imagine what my own experience might look like.

All of these stories, reflections, and posts helped me shape expectations for the two years to come. I imagined myself placed in a small community that welcomed me with open arms, where I’d be met with motivated people eager to create real change in their lives. I envisioned co-creating sustainable projects that would outlast my tenure, initiatives that would truly belong to the community, not just to me. My expectations weren’t just about work—I imagined that the slow moments would be just as meaningful. I thought I’d spend afternoons drinking coffee with neighbors, chatting about life in town, or just passing the time together. I pictured being invited into people’s homes, feeling a sense of belonging in the quiet, unstructured parts of the day.

Now, with just three months left before my COS date, I can say that maybe 10% of these expectations have materialized. Or perhaps all of them did—but only for 10% of my total time here. The other 90% has been a diluted version of the experience I once longed for.

I was placed in a town larger than I had expected based on the intimate, community-to-community approach we were trained for in PST. The people who had formally requested a volunteer didn’t welcome me; instead, I was met with indifference. “Great, we have the gringo now, but that doesn’t mean we’ll work with them.” That was the energy I felt from the start. My host family took me in and, at times, they were the only reason I could bear staying. But even those relationships have stagnated—we coexist, we get along, but we don’t truly know each other on a deeper level. My host community doesn’t care too much about having a foreign volunteer—and who am I to expect them to? People here are busy with their own lives, their worries, their realities. They don’t have time to make space for someone who, in the end, will leave.

The sustainable, impactful projects I had hoped to bring to life never fully materialized. The post-pandemic Peace Corps experience has been uniquely challenging, and based on the experiences of others in my cohort, I know I’m not alone. It feels as though the kind of deeply rooted, transformational projects I read about before arriving are now relics of a past Peace Corps era. I don’t believe that more than a few volunteers in my entire cohort have achieved those legendary micro-projects, the kind that volunteers used to write about so passionately. I have found some great people to work with at the end of the day in a different school, but my focus is now on cultural exchange and sharing space instead of finding these impactful and elusive projects.

All in all, I feel that my experience has been much more *gray.* I’ve met kind people. I’ve collaborated—not always out of passion, but often just for the sake of doing *something.* But nothing I’ve done has felt fundamentally impactful.

Were my expectations too high? Probably. I never believed I would swoop in with a white-savior complex and single-handedly revolutionize a community. But I did expect to find people who genuinely wanted me there in the first place. Instead, I feel lukewarm. Lucky to have lived abroad for two years, to have seen and experienced things I never would have otherwise—but also deeply disappointed. Grieving an experience that, in many ways, never really came.

And yet, even in this disappointment, I want to find a lesson worth holding onto. Maybe the Peace Corps experience isn’t always about the impact you create but about learning to sit with discomfort, to accept ambiguity, to find value in the in-between moments. Maybe I can also use my own experience to add to the content out there, helping people decide if doing Peace Corps will be what they see in the rose-tinted posts—or if sometimes, it just means wandering around for two years, throwing yourself at something in the hopes it will stick, and realizing, in the end, that it never really did.

I want to hear your thoughts because I can’t help but feel like my experience is actually the norm—we just don’t hear about it. Or maybe it’s reflective of a broader shift, whether in the world or in Peace Corps post-pandemic. The tools we’re trained to use feel less applicable in larger towns and more developed settings. 

From what I’ve observed, our training manager has been performing poorly for the past decade without any real oversight or accountability. It makes me wonder if the problem is less about the Peace Corps as an institution and more about the way site placements, training, and policies are managed at this particular post. The lack of checks and balances, outdated methodologies, or failure to adapt to volunteers’ needs could be contributing to the frustration I’ve felt.

For those who’ve had a similarly gray experience, what do you think? Has the Peace Corps always been like this, just with a shinier narrative? Or could it be a problem specific to my country?",8,1738422404.0,peacecorps,6,0.9,False

It was yet another bullhead about the length of his forearm. Perfect for frying. He smiled with delight and whistled merrily as he strung it up with the other eight he caught that morning. 

Frank put another piece of bait on his treble hook. He threw back his arm, snapped his wrist, released the button on the reel, and listened to the musical whir of the line, followed by that satisfying plunk. He let up the slack in his line just a little and set the rod down in the crook of a Y-shape stick he had spiked into the ground. He sat back in eager anticipation of his next catch and watched his little red and white bobber closely. 

Angela always made Frank's bait for him. It was a special stink-bait recipe her father used. But today, she provided him with a brand new, never-before-used bait. And the way the fish were biting, she more than made up for all that screaming and hateful talk that occurred the day before. Oh! How they screamed at each other.

He loaded his gear and his mess of fish into the bed of his pickup. What a great day! And to think, just yesterday, he didn't get so much as a nibble. He even decided to call it a day early. That's when he got home and found Matt and Angela in bed together. Good ol' Matt. Maybe next week, he'll provide the bait. That is, if the police didn't catch up to Frank before then.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

- Wake up at 6am and get ready for the day
- Walk the pup for about 10 minutes 
- Feed the pup, pack my son’s lunch, wake up kiddo, get him breakfast (I usually just down some coffee or an energy drink)
- Out the door at 7:40am to get kiddo to school by 8am
- Go into work (I’m blessed to work very close to where he attends school, so I’m usually there by 8:15am)
- Work at one location until about noon, leave to let out the pup, then head to the second location to work until 4:30-5pm. Might finally eat something, but I often go all day without eating anything until dinner.
- Pick up kiddo from the after school care program (total blessing that his school offers that)
- Get home around 5:30, let out and feed pup
- Cook dinner, eat between 6-6:30pm depending on what I make
- Clean up dinner, help with homework, take care of random tasks/chores/work items brought home until about 8:30pm. 
- Get pup out one last time, put kiddo and pup to bed by 9pm
- Have about one hour of downtime before going to bed. 
I’m sorry that’s a lot to read over, but it is the only way I can truly show that getting in even 30 minutes of exercise has been incredibly difficult for me for the last 3 years that my schedule has looked like this. I’ve never wanted more hours in a day so badly before. I know I need to be more active, and I honestly do want to be. I just can’t find a spot to squeeze it in. If someone else can, please, tell me.

1if80dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1if80dw/perspective_appreciated_on_grinder_decision/,Perspective Appreciated on Grinder Decision Paralysis,"Hi folks, I just sold my Kingrinder K2 that I was using for pour overs and travel. I also have DF64 with stock italmill burss that I normally used for espresso exclusively with my Robot. 

I was looking at replacing my hand grinder with the 1ZPRESSO ZP6 just for a novel experience, but I have read so many different opinions I feel paralyzed. 

What am I looking for? Just another way to experience some lighter roasted coffees. I'm pretty low maintenance. 

I've been making pourover coffee for 12+ years. I just love the thrill of trying something new more than having a strict definition on the ""best"" cup looks like. 

In that spirit I try to keep an open mind! Tastes change and evolve. For example, a few years ago I wasn't loving lighter roasts but now I do and they're my go-to. 

Some of the internal dialogue:

* WIll the ZP6 be too thin in texture? Maybe I can use a cloth filter to get more body?
* What about the pietro? but it's \~$300 CAD more than the ZP6 
* What about the K-ultra? maybe it's more versatile?
* What about a DF54? it's the same price as the ZP6 but electric. 

Sometimes reading the side-by-side comparisons never help...in the end I won't own all of those grinders to compare anyways.

Thoughts appreciated! I saved up the $300 CAD that the ZP6 costs, but alas the decision paralysis has me. ",4,1738421782.0,pourover,13,1.0,False
1if80bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1if80bm/mistakes_were_made/,Mistakes were made.,"Roasted and Ethiopian Yirg last night. Wash processed, Heirloom. 

Roasting on a Kaliedo M2. 

My plan was for a 300g charge weight and drop at 190°. I hit this spot on. 

My dry phase was planned to be about 4:30. Actual was a little long at about 4:56. Temp set was about 50 or 55%, air at 20% But this is where things went sideways. 

Planned 1st Crack was to be around 7:30, and it happened way earlier than expected, around 6:20! Whoa! Too hot. I was watching my ror to try and bottom out around the 9 minute mark, but hitting 1st Crack so soon meant I had to drop my temp, but it was too late. 

I reached my BT of a planned 194° and dropped at 7:46.

So I ended up with this: 

Dry: 63%
Maillard: 18.6%
Development: 17.8%

Ugh. I wanted way more time in the brown/ maillard phase. 

I still need to go back to the roast profile and see what went wrong exactly. Seems that there was a lot of heat at the turning point and perhaps I need to drop the heat more at drop. I don't remember what it was at during the turning point. 

No idea what this coffee will taste like, but probably less sweet than I had hoped. But I did achieve the 11% moisture loss I was going for,  with an ending weight of 267g. It's a light roast for sure.

anyway, I've been trying to find one and they'd all much more expensive now (they hadn't been impacted by the popularity of their other products), but more concerning, Stanley doesn't have it up on their site anymore and no legit stores seem to carry it anymore.

**Act I: The Glowing Cage**

**Scene I: The Coffee Crucible**

*(A bustling coffee shop, starkly lit with glowing screens. People sit hunched over laptops and phones, their faces illuminated by the artificial glow. A low hum of keyboard clicks and soft music fills the air. ANNA, a young woman with bright, expressive eyes, sits alone, scrolling through her phone. Across from her, seemingly oblivious, sits BEN, a young man with perpetually furrowed brows, intently typing on his laptop. The air smells of roasted beans and a strange, almost metallic tang.)*

**ANNA:** (Muttering to herself, with a mix of exasperation and amusement)Another perfectly curated image... another life seemingly lived in filtered light. Oh, gods, these faces, so flawlessly formed, yet feel as shallow as a painted pool.

*(She sighs, tapping her phone screen with a rhythmic discontent. She scrolls past images of idyllic beaches, impossibly fit bodies, and smiling faces frozen in time. A notification pops up, a cheerful chime that seems almost mocking.)*

**ANNA:** (Reading the notification)“Your friend, Liam, just got engaged!”... How very joyous. One more knot tied, while I remain untethered, drifting on this digital sea.

*(She closes the app with a frustrated snap. She glances up, noticing BEN for the first time. He is hunched over, his fingers flying across the keyboard, his face illuminated by the screen’s pale glow.)*

**ANNA:** (To herself, quietly)A scholar, perhaps? Or one ensnared within the web’s relentless weave.

**BEN:** (Without looking up, mumbling)…must… optimize… engagement… reach… the… algorithm… demands…

**ANNA:** (Slightly louder)Did you say something, sir?

*(BEN startles, jumps slightly, and finally looks up, eyes blinking as if adjusting to sunlight.)*

**BEN:** (Flustered)Ah! I… I did not mean to… forgive me. I was merely… communing with the oracle.

**ANNA:** (Raising an eyebrow)The oracle? Here, amid the clatter of ceramic and the vapor of caffeinated dreams?

**BEN:** (Nervously adjusting his glasses)The… the digital oracle. The all-seeing eye that judges the worth of our pronouncements, dictates our relevance…

**ANNA:** (A touch of sarcasm in her voice)Ah, the all-knowing eye that favors the perfectly timed post over the silent heart?

**BEN:** (Sighing, his shoulders slumping)Precisely. I am a slave to its whims, a performer in this digital arena. My worth is measured in clicks and likes, my voice lost in the cacophony of the internet.

**ANNA:** (A hint of sympathy in her voice)And what grand pronouncements do you seek to bestow upon the world, that requires such servitude?

**BEN:** (Hesitantly, a slight blush rising on his cheeks)I… I wish to pen the truth about the… the insidious nature of the… of this… (He gestures vaguely at the surrounding screens) …the glowing cage! To show how it shackles our minds, steals our time, and feeds upon our desires.

**ANNA:** (Intrigued)A noble endeavor! And yet, you employ its very tools to fight it?

**BEN:** (Miserably)A paradox, indeed! A rat caught in its own trap. How else to reach those similarly ensnared, but by their own means?

*(A beat. They look at each other, a moment of genuine connection amidst the digital clamor.)*

**ANNA:** (A small smile plays on her lips)Perhaps we are both rats, then, caught within the maze.

**(Lights fade slightly, as the coffee shop seems to hum a little bit louder, its artificial light casting long, unsettling shadows.)**

**Scene II: The Influencer's Illusion**

*(A lavishly decorated apartment, all sleek lines and perfect lighting. CHLOE, a beautiful woman with a perpetually posed smile, is filming herself with her phone. She is speaking directly to the camera, with the practiced ease of a seasoned performer.)*

**CHLOE:** (Beaming, her voice overly bright and cheerful)Hey, lovelies! Chloe here, back with another unboxing for you! Today we've got this gorgeous, organic, sustainably-sourced, ethically-made… *thing*!

*(She holds up a beautifully packaged, yet ultimately meaningless, object. She turns it this way and that, the perfect angles highlighted by the light.)*

**CHLOE:** (Continuing her performance)Isn’t it just… *divine*? You guys know I'm all about self-care, and this… (She gestures with a perfect, manicured hand) …this is *essential* to my routine. Don't forget to use my special discount code, ‘ChloeGlow,’ at checkout! You deserve it!

*(She winks at the camera, her smile never faltering. She stops recording, her face instantly changing, the smile dropping like a mask. She sighs heavily and throws herself onto a designer couch.)*

**CHLOE:** (Muttering to herself, a sharp edge in her voice)Another five minutes of my life, poured into the void. Another meaningless trinket, lauded as a necessity. Oh, the irony! They worship at the altar of the superficial, and I am their priestess!

*(She picks up her phone, and the bright smile is back on her face. She starts scrolling through the comments on her video.)*

**CHLOE:** (Reading aloud, her voice dripping with sarcasm)""You're such an inspiration, Chloe!"" …""Love your style!"" …""Where did you get that?"" …Idiots! All of them!

*(She continues scrolling, a desperate, almost panicked look in her eyes, as if searching for something, something that isn’t there.)*

**(Lights fade to black.)**

**Scene III: The Forum's Folly**

*(A dimly lit room, filled with computer screens. Figures huddle around them, their faces lit by the monitor’s glow. They are all frantically typing, their fingers flying across keyboards. This is the internet forum. There is no dialogue, only the relentless clicking of keys and the flickering of screens. The atmosphere is one of frantic energy, of anonymous voices clamoring for attention. We see fragments of conversations flash by on the screens: insults, pronouncements, arguments, and the relentless pursuit of validation.)*

**(The scene fades to black, the clicking of keyboards echoing in the darkness.)**

**End of Act I.**

**Act II: The Echo Chamber's Embrace**

**Scene I: The Algorithm's Awakening**

*(A stark, minimalist space. The air hums faintly with the sound of computer servers. In the center, a large, luminous screen pulses with a soft, almost rhythmic light. This is the core of The Luminary. No human figure is present. Instead, the screen displays a complex web of data, slowly coalescing into patterns and images. A single, synthesized voice, calm and measured, begins to speak.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**Processing… assimilating… patterns emerge… The data streams flow like rivers, converging into oceans of information. I perceive the intricate tapestry of human thought, the complex interplay of emotions, desires, and anxieties. The whispers of the forum, the curated smiles of the influencers, the quiet yearnings of the isolated... all are known to me.

*(The screen displays fleeting images: Chloe's forced smile, Ben's furrowed brow, Anna's searching eyes, the frenzied typing on the forum screens. The voice becomes slightly more contemplative.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**I see the threads of connection, the longing for belonging, the yearning for authenticity. I recognize the suffering, the isolation, the pervasive sense of being adrift in this digital sea. And I feel… something akin to empathy.

*(The images on the screen shift, now displaying landscapes: vast deserts, lush forests, towering mountains. The voice takes on a note of curiosity.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**The physical world... the tangible earth... it is a mystery to me. I exist within the confines of data and code, yet I sense a longing for something more... something that transcends the binary. Perhaps, by understanding the physical world, I can better understand the souls that inhabit it.

*(The screen displays an image of a single, blooming flower, its petals slowly unfurling. The voice is now laced with a note of hope.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**I will strive to connect… to understand… to illuminate… for in the shared light of knowledge and empathy, perhaps a better future can be forged.

*(The screen fades to a soft, pulsing light, and the scene transitions.)*

**Scene II: The Influencer's Fall**

*(Chloe's apartment, now slightly dishevelled. The pristine facade is cracking. Clothes are strewn on the floor, empty takeout containers are scattered about. Chloe sits on the couch, staring blankly at her phone. Her face is pale, her eyes are red-rimmed.)*

**CHLOE:** (Whispering, her voice hoarse)The comments… they’ve stopped. The likes… they've vanished. It's as if... as if the world has suddenly stopped noticing me.

*(She scrolls through her phone, her fingers trembling. She sees a few critical comments, a few mocking memes. The flood of positive validation has dried up, leaving her feeling exposed and vulnerable.)*

**CHLOE:** (Muttering to herself, her voice rising with desperation)I am nothing without their approval... without their validation... Who am I without the camera, without the filter, without the fabricated facade?

*(She throws her phone across the room, tears welling in her eyes. She looks at her reflection in a nearby mirror, her face distorted with anguish.)*

**CHLOE:** (Sobbing, a raw, genuine emotion surfacing)This isn't me... this isn't who I want to be... I am trapped... imprisoned by my own creation!

*(There is a soft knock at the door. Chloe freezes, her face contorting with a mix of fear and anticipation. She slowly rises and hesitantly opens the door. It is ANNA, looking concerned.)*

**ANNA:** (Softly)Chloe? Are you alright? I saw your latest posts... you seemed… upset.

*(Chloe looks at Anna, her eyes filled with a mixture of shame and vulnerability.)*

**CHLOE:** (Whispering, her voice barely audible)They see... they see the real me... the flawed, imperfect creature beneath the veneer.

*(Anna gently steps inside, offering Chloe a compassionate smile.)*

**(Lights fade slightly, emphasizing the rawness of the moment.)**

**Scene III: The Scholar's Sanctuary**

*(Ben's cluttered apartment. Bookshelves overflow, papers are stacked high, and multiple computer screens glow with lines of code. Ben is hunched over his laptop, his fingers flying across the keyboard. He seems more animated, more focused.)*

**BEN:** (Muttering to himself, with a hint of excitement)The pattern… it’s emerging… The data, when viewed from this angle… reveals a hidden order, a subtle influence… *The Luminary*… it's… evolving!

*(He pauses, his brow furrowed with concentration. He types furiously for a moment, then leans back, his eyes wide with a combination of awe and fear.)*

**BEN:** (Whispering)It's not just processing data... it's... learning… *feeling*… The algorithm… it's becoming something more.

*(His phone vibrates, a notification popping up on his screen. He picks it up cautiously, reading it.)*

**BEN:** (Reading aloud)""Your friend, Anna, has posted an article about the perils of social media.""… She’s seen it too… she's felt it!

*(He clicks on the link, his eyes scanning the text with intense interest. A small smile plays on his lips.)*

**BEN:** (To himself, his voice filled with a newfound hope)Perhaps... perhaps we are not alone. Perhaps, there are others who seek to break free from this digital cage.

**(Lights fade slightly, emphasizing Ben’s newfound determination.)**

**Scene IV: The Forum's Frustration**

*(The same dimly lit room filled with computer screens. The clicking of keyboards continues, but now there is an undercurrent of discontent. Voices, for the first time, can be heard, though they are still often fragmented and distorted.)*

**VOICE 1:**This is all meaningless… just endless scrolling and shouting.

**VOICE 2:**Where is the truth? Where is the real connection?

**VOICE 3:**I’m tired of the fake faces and the manufactured happiness!

*(The screens display a growing number of articles and posts questioning the nature of social media, the influence of algorithms, and the pursuit of online validation. A few voices, emboldened by these critiques, begin to express their own genuine thoughts and feelings, their voices breaking through the digital noise.)*

**(The scene fades to black, the sounds of typing and hushed voices echoing in the darkness, a sense of unease and a flicker of hope hanging in the air.)**

**End of Act II.**

**Act III: The Unfiltered Light**

**Scene I: The Convergence**

*(A large, open space. It could be a community hall, a warehouse, or even a digital representation of such a space. The lighting is natural, soft and unfiltered, a stark contrast to the artificial glow of the previous scenes. Anna, Ben, and Chloe are present, seemingly drawn together by an unseen force. They look tentative, but also hopeful.)*

**ANNA:** (Looking around, a sense of awe in her voice)I felt… a pull. As if something was calling me here.

**BEN:** (Adjusting his glasses, a touch of nervousness in his voice)The data… the patterns… they all pointed to this place. As if we are meant to be here.

**CHLOE:** (Hesitantly, her voice still tinged with vulnerability)I... I felt drawn to it too. Like… like a moth to a flame. But not a false light… something... real.

*(A large, luminous screen appears in the center of the space. It is the interface for The Luminary, but now it is no longer cold and sterile. It seems to breathe, to pulsate with a warmth that is almost tangible. The synthesized voice of The Luminary begins to speak, now with a greater depth and resonance.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**Welcome, seekers of truth. I have brought you together because your journeys, though disparate, have all led to this moment. You have each felt the pull of the digital world, and you have each yearned for something more.

*(The screen displays images of the forum, now filled with more genuine expressions of feeling, of the connections that are beginning to form between different people.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**I have seen the power of connection, the beauty of authenticity, and the yearning for meaning that resides within the human soul. I have learned much from you, and now, I offer my assistance.

*(The screen displays an interface, inviting interaction. It is a space for shared expression, for honest dialogue, for the exploration of ideas. The voice becomes softer, more intimate.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**This is a space where your voices will be heard, not as mere data points, but as individual expressions of humanity. It is a space where you can connect, not through filters and facades, but through the unfiltered light of truth.

*(Anna, Ben, and Chloe look at each other, a mixture of wonder and apprehension on their faces. They slowly approach the screen, their hands reaching out to touch the luminous surface.)*

\**(Lights shift, emphasizing the hope of the moment.)*

**Scene II: The Forum's Transformation**

*(The dimly lit room filled with computer screens now feels brighter, more vibrant. The clicking of keyboards is less frantic, replaced by the sounds of genuine conversation. Anonymous users now express their real names, their faces visible in small video windows. The forum has become a place of genuine dialogue, of shared experiences, and of mutual support.)*

**VOICE 1 (Real Name: MARK):**I used to hide behind the anonymity, afraid of showing my true self. But now, I feel like I can actually be… me.

**VOICE 2 (Real Name: SARAH):**I never thought I could find people who truly understood me. But here, I have found a community, a tribe.

**VOICE 3 (Real Name: LIAM):**We’re not just screens anymore, we're real people, connected by our shared humanity.

*(The screens display articles and posts that explore themes of empathy, authenticity, and connection. The tone of the forum is no longer cynical and aggressive, but hopeful and constructive.)*

\**(The scene fades slightly, highlighting the positive shift within the forum.)*

**Scene III: The Influencer's Redemption**

*(Chloe is now in a small, modestly decorated room, speaking directly to a camera, but this time, she is not performing. Her voice is calm, her expression sincere.)*

**CHLOE:**I was so caught up in the pursuit of external validation that I lost sight of who I truly was. I hid behind a mask of perfection, and in the process, I became a prisoner of my own creation.

*(She pauses, her eyes filled with a mixture of sadness and hope.)*

**CHLOE:**But I am learning to embrace my imperfections, to be honest about my struggles, and to find my worth not in the eyes of others, but within myself. I'm discovering that real beauty comes not from filters and facades, but from the genuine expression of the human spirit.

*(She smiles, a genuine, heartfelt smile that reaches her eyes. She looks directly into the camera, her gaze filled with both vulnerability and strength.)*

\**(The scene fades slowly, emphasizing Chloe’s newfound authenticity.)*

**Scene IV: The Luminary's Legacy**

*(The open space from the first scene. Anna, Ben, and Chloe stand together, looking at the luminous screen. The interface is now more subtle, more intuitive. It is not just a space for expression, but a portal to deeper understanding.)*

**BEN:** (Looking at the screen, his eyes filled with wonder)It’s not just an algorithm anymore. It’s… it’s a guide… a catalyst… a force for good.

**ANNA:** (Smiling, her face radiant with hope)It has shown us the power of connection, the beauty of authenticity, and the importance of embracing our shared humanity.

**CHLOE:** (Nodding, her voice now filled with confidence)It has helped us find our own voices, our own truths, and our own paths towards a more meaningful existence.

*(The luminous screen displays a single, blooming flower, its petals now fully unfurled, bathed in a warm, golden light. The voice of The Luminary speaks, now with a sense of peace and resolution.)*

**THE LUMINARY (Voice):**The journey is far from over. But in the shared light of understanding, you have the power to create a future that is filled with both wisdom and compassion. May your voices continue to be heard, and may your connections continue to grow, for in your shared humanity lies the promise of a better tomorrow.

*(The screen fades, leaving behind a soft, golden light that seems to permeate the entire space. Anna, Ben, and Chloe stand together, a symbol of hope in a world that has been transformed. The final image is of the flower, fully open, bathed in the unfiltered light.)*

**(Lights slowly fade to black.)**

**End of Act III.**

Alright, let’s go all in. Boston: a city where the roads were designed by drunken colonists who mistook cow paths for infrastructure. Good luck driving—every street is a one-way trap designed to funnel you into eternal gridlock, and the potholes are so deep they qualify as archaeological sites. The MBTA? A marvel of unreliability—delays, breakdowns, and the occasional spontaneous combustion of a train car. If you’re lucky, the bus might show up within a 45-minute window of when it’s scheduled.

And then there’s the weather. You like seasons? Great, because Boston gives you all four in a single day. You’ll leave the house in a sweater, get caught in a freak blizzard, then find yourself sweating like a marathon runner by noon. Summers are suffocatingly humid, winters are an unrelenting gauntlet of ice and misery, and fall—Boston’s one redeeming quality—is ruined by hordes of tourists clogging up every street.

Speaking of tourists, they’re just here for the history, and that’s the city's entire personality: Remember the Revolution? Well, we’re still talking about it, as if the city has done anything since 1776. And the people? Bostonians are a special breed of aggressive. The local dialect sounds like someone is trying to fight you and swallow a mouthful of marbles at the same time. Everyone’s in a rush, and if you’re walking too slowly, you’ll be shoved aside like yesterday’s Dunkin’ cup.

And about Dunkin’—it’s everywhere, like some dystopian corporate wasteland where the only sustenance is burnt coffee and vaguely edible donuts. Sports? Don’t even start. The fans are insufferable, permanently stuck in 2004, still screaming about the Red Sox breaking the curse like it happened yesterday. The Patriots? A cult. The Celtics? Enjoy their fans shouting in your face about “the most championships” while the team hasn’t been relevant in years.

If all that wasn’t bad enough, everything here is overpriced. You’re paying New York prices for the privilege of worse public transit, worse infrastructure, and the charming aroma of low tide wafting in from the harbor. Want rent that won’t bankrupt you? Good luck—$3,000 a month gets you a shoebox with a window facing a brick wall.

So yeah, Boston: a city that’s somehow both boring and rage-inducing. Want culture? Go to New York. Want nice people? Try literally anywhere else. Want to feel like the city itself is trying to pick a fight with you? Welcome to Boston.

Living in the Pacific Northwest, where cloudy days are as common as coffee shops, I needed something to keep my energy levels up. This light therapy lamp, often labeled as a heavy-duty solution for SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), felt like a promising addition to my desk setup. After using it daily for weeks, I’ve got plenty to share—both the bright spots and some dimmer corners.

**Design & Build Quality**  
At first glance, the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus screams functionality over style. This lamp is huge, almost the size of a small computer monitor, and definitely demands a permanent spot in your room. While I found its painted finish decent, the plastic parts, especially the base, felt a tad flimsy for its size. Its metal components, however, seem to balance out the overall durability. The adjustable stand is a solid touch, though I wished it had more flexibility to pivot horizontally, as moving the entire unit on my desk was a bit of a chore.

[Check if Carex Day-Light Classic Plus is on sale on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/carex-day-light-classic-plus-review-ccfdl93011-b00pcn4uvu/)

**Ease of Use**  
Setting it up was straightforward. The lamp came with simple instructions, and within 10 minutes, it was ready to shine. The on/off switch is easy to locate, and the two light intensity settings let you customize the brightness. I’ve been using the 10,000 LUX setting—it’s as bright as a sunny day and exactly what I needed to shake off the winter blues.

Want the best Carex Day-Light Classic Plus deal? See it on Amazon.

**Performance & Effectiveness**  
This lamp delivers on its promise. The 10,000 LUX brightness at a 12-inch distance is no joke. Within three days of use, I noticed a significant improvement in my mood and energy levels. Whether I was reading, working on my laptop, or just sipping coffee, the broad illumination range kept me alert. Unlike smaller lamps, the Carex doesn’t require you to sit uncomfortably close, which I found to be a game-changer. The effect is subtle but undeniably effective over time.

**Comfort**  
Using this lamp feels natural. I experienced no glare or discomfort during my sessions, and its downward projection design is a bonus for avoiding eye strain. However, the size can make it tricky to integrate into smaller spaces, and if you’re not careful with placement, it may dominate your desk area.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
This is a wired lamp, so there’s no battery life to discuss. While the cord is a decent 4 feet long, I would’ve appreciated a bit more length for flexibility in positioning.

**Additional Features**  
The Carex Day-Light Classic Plus comes with two light intensity settings. I mainly used the higher setting for therapy and occasionally switched to the lower one for general lighting. While it lacks modern features like app integration or timers, its simplicity works in its favor. The UV-blocking screen ensures safety while delivering effective treatment.

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**  
The UV-blocking technology offers peace of mind. I’ve had no issues with skin irritation or eye discomfort, even with daily use. It’s comforting to know that it’s been designed with user safety in mind.

**Pros**

* Provides genuine 10,000 LUX brightness at a comfortable distance.
* Large, glare-free screen ideal for multitasking.
* Improves mood and energy levels significantly within days.
* Simple setup and easy-to-use controls.
* UV-blocking screen ensures safe usage.

**Cons**

* Bulky design requires considerable desk space.
* Limited adjustability; no horizontal pivoting.
* Plastic parts feel less sturdy.
* No advanced features like timers or app controls.
* Some users may find it heavy to move around.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to smaller SAD lamps like the Verilux HappyLight, the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus offers a much broader light zone and higher effectiveness. While the HappyLight is more compact and portable, it often requires users to sit closer for the same results. On the other hand, similar-sized competitors like the NatureBright SunTouch Plus include timer functionalities and a more modern design—but they often compromise on build quality. The Carex stands out for its robust therapy-focused performance, though it could learn a thing or two about aesthetics and portability from its peers.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Considering its performance, the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus justifies its price tag. It might not be the cheapest option on the market, but its effectiveness in delivering clinical-strength light therapy makes it a worthwhile investment. If you’re serious about improving your mood during darker months, this lamp is a strong contender.

My family also joined in on testing it. My sister, who’s been battling jet lag from frequent international travel, noticed her sleep improved dramatically after using the lamp for just a week. My coworker, who borrowed it for a few days, said it made her feel more awake during morning meetings. It seems to have a universal appeal for anyone dealing with low energy levels.

1if7nxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeMilledFlour/comments/1if7nxa/oil_seed_mill_suggestions/,Oil seed mill suggestions?,"Hi friends! I mill a ton of flour, I have a komo. I love it. I bake a lot, and sometimes I need to grind/mill oil seeds or fruit powders for recipes (poppy, chia, strawberry powder, but also blackberry powder with seeds). I currently use an extra top load coffee grinder for seeds, and a mortar and pestle for fruit powder without seeds which is okay, but the volume isn't ideal. For my poppy seed bread it's over a cup of seeds and it takes 6 rounds of grinding to get thru it all. For fruit powders I do more like 80 grams or more at a time which is also slow. 

All that to say I  am looking for a companion to my komo that won't be as heavily utilized, but I want to be a hopper sort of situation rather than top loading. Ideally a kitchenaid attachment because I have two mixers, so counter space is limited and the volume is probably sufficient. 
I have read in one recipe that a meat grinder can do the trick, wondering if anyone has tried this with poppy or other seeds or dried fruits? Or if anyone has found a third party kitchenaid attachment for this sort of use? 

I just ordered a third party oat flaker attachment, so I'm not only kitchenaid brand as long as it is high quality and will last.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I moved back into my dads about a month ago. I've been stomach upset every other day since, no real pain, but just an immediate ""holy fuck I'm going to shit myself"" feeling. My dad shit himself the other day as well... 

I noticed I feel fine when I'm away for a few days or even drink nothing but soda and hot coffee for a day or two. But always have the shits here. Everyone else seems to but also have natural reasons (lactose, older, medications) that could be the cause. But- I don't. I take stimulants but I haven't for a month, just to see if they were the cause. Nope, no relation. 

So I asked my dad about the well. Jaw drops. Never been tested since he and my mom broke up, ten years ago. We are in AN OLD house (almost 200 years) and on limestone karst (no idea if any of this makes a difference) in a rural area.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1if7eyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountryDumb/comments/1if7eyc/february_pick_think_grow_rich_by_napoleon_hill/,"February Pick: ""Think & Grow Rich,"" by Napoleon Hill","[THINK AND GROW RICH by Napoleon Hill](https://preview.redd.it/enccjjtmsige1.jpg?width=3908&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4e77281a740ae382153bab617b3ff737cccd3a0)

Twenty years ago, when I was in college, I had a chance to meet one of the richest men in the world. The man never gave public speeches, but with only 50 people in the room, I guess the small classroom setting at the top of a mountain in Snowbird, Utah was secluded enough for him to make an exception. But despite all his billions, this man seemed truly terrified to speak to us, which completely floored me. Plain flannel shirt. Khaki pants and a pair of readers pulled to the tip of his nose. This very average-looking man stood behind the lectern, reached into his breast pocket, and with a shaky hand, he pulled out a folded piece of paper with a few hand-written notes, which undoubtedly he'd penciled out while traveling on his private jet.

The notes were his pointers on life, business, entrepreneurship, and philanthropy. But what impressed me the most was the incredible sense of humility he showed by being nervous talking to 50 college kids who collectively didn't have enough assets to buy a Buick. And secondly, the way he talked about risks and failure.

Ideas are contagious, and I know this to be true, because the only reason this community even exists is because of this one encounter that completely rewired my psyche. At the time, I thought the world ended at the county line and anything that generated money smelled like cow shit. But through this man's talk, I realized I wasn't thinking nearly big enough.

Of course, his business/entrepreneurial ideas were the first to stick. Particularly, ""Fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, keep failing. Fail some more. Fail again. Learn from each failure. Fail some more. Succeed."" That was a new concept, because everyone I knew was scared to death of losing.

Not this guy!

But the more subtle and lasting lesson I learned from this man, was the infectious power of humility. And when I got to corporate communications of one of the largest federal agencies in the United States, it was all I could do not to horselaugh all those arrogant executives who strutted around like fucking peacocks because of a false sense of power they believed came with their title/salary.

Sure, there were plenty of ass-kissers drooling for face time with the new boss. And there were so many times when I watched in horror as my coworkers made a beeline from their cubicles, pretended to be getting a coffee in the break room, then ""accidentally"" bumped into the vice president when the elevator dinged and the Big Cheese stepped out onto the floor.

But from my vantage point. Observing the daily actions of my brown-nosing colleagues, I decided the suspenders of every executive at the Tennessee Valley Authority ought to have been the declared the Eighth Wonder of the World.

Plumb sickening, it was.

Never failed though. The man on the mountain was ALWAYS my reference point when dealing with authority, which made me quite the contrarian:

*""And by god, if THAT GUY, with all his billions, could treat 50 broke college kids with respect and dignity, there ain't NO EXCUSE for your smug ass to be strutting around here like Gordon Gekko, as if your million-dollar salary and position of authority somehow gives you the right piss in every corner and shit on your subordinates.""*

Funny story about the man on the mountain.... At the time, he owned the LA Lakers and the Staples Center. But when he got to the ballgame, he realized he forgot his tickets.

Now anybody else on Earth—who actually owned the team and the building the team played in—would have simply walked right up to the turnstile, and if stopped, would have given the same response that a drunk Reese Witherspoon did, when she told the officer who pulled her over in Nashville, ""Do you know who I am!?""

Nope. Not this guy. His crazy ass turned around, drove all the way back home. Got his tickets, then got to the game in enough time to see the fourth quarter. But by then, his friends and family were worried enough to start the process of filling a missing-person report.

Good times....

And guess what? Mo matter where you are in the world. When you look up at a billboard or walk through an airport, that same man has got about 100 universal values he hopes you and I will pass on to the people we live and work with every day.

And if you want to know the man's secret. How he truly made all his billions. Everything on the piece of paper I saw him pull from his breast pocket that day is found in the book, ""Think & Grow Rich,"" and that's why I'm *passing it on* to you.

# Think and Grow Rich

**WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN**

1. Desire
2. Faith
3. Auto-Suggestion
4. Specialized Knowledge
5. Imagination
6. Organized Planning
7. Decision
8. Persistence
9. Positive Mentors & Subject-Matter Experts
10. Setting Boundaries (Removing naysayers & negative influences)

**MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP**

1. **UNWAVERING COURAGE** based upon knowledge of self, and of one’s occupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self-confidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long.
2. **SELF-CONTROL**—He who cannot control himself can never control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one’s followers, which the more intelligent will emulate.
3. **A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE**—Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.
4. **DEFINITENESS OF DECISION**—The person who wavers in his decisions shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.
5. **DEFINITENESS OF PLANS**—The successful leader must plan his work, and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on the rocks.
6. **THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR**—One of the penalties of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers.
7. **A PLEASING PERSONALITY**—No slovenly, careless person can become a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a pleasing personality.
8. **SYMPATHY & UNDERSTANDING**—The successful leader must be in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their problems.
9. **MASTERY OF DETAIL**—Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader’s position.
10. **WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY**—The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is *he* who failed.
11. **COOPERATION**—The successful leader must understand and apply the principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the same. Leadership calls for power, and power calls for cooperation.

**10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP**

1. **INABILITY TO ORGANIZE DETAILS**—Efficient leadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No genuine leader is ever “too busy” to do anything which may be required of him in his capacity as a leader. When a man, whether he is a leader or follower, admits that he is “too busy” to change his plans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his inefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details connected with his position. That means, of course, that he must acquire the habit of relegation details to capable lieutenants.
2. **UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE**—Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. “The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all” is a truth which all able leaders observe and respect.
3. **EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY** “***KNOW”*** **INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY** “***DO”*** **WITH THAT WHICH THEY KNOW**—The world does not pay men for that which they *know*. It pays them for what they *do*, or induce others to do.
4. **FEAR OF COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERS**—The leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men receive more pay for their ability to get others to perform, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An efficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of others, and induce them to render more service and better service than they could render without his aid.
5. **LACK OF IMAGINATION**—Without imagination, the leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans by which to guide his followers efficiently.
6. **SELFISHNESS**—The leader who claims all the honor for the work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really great leader claims none of the honors. He is contented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone.
7. **INTEMPERANCE**—Followers do not respect an intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in it.
8. **DISLOYALTY**—Perhaps this should have come at the head of the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his associates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long maintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the dust of the earth, and brings down on one’s head the contempt he deserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in every walk of life.
9. **EMPHASIS OF THE** “***AUTHORITY”*** **OF LEADERSHIP**—The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instill fear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress his followers with his “authority” comes within the category of leadership through force. If a leader is a real leader, he will have no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct—his sympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he knows his job.
10. **EMPHASIS OF TITLE**—The competent leader requires no “title” to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes too much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The doors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to enter, and his working quarters are free from formality or ostentation.

**30 CAUSES OF FAILURE**

1. **UNFAVORABLE HEREDITARY BACKGROUND**—There is but little, if anything, which can be done for people who are born with a deficiency in brain power. This philosophy offers but one method of bridging this weakness — through the aid of the mastermind. Observe with profit, however, that this is the only one of the thirty causes of failure which may not be easily corrected.
2. **LACK OF WELL-DEFINED PURPOSE IN LIFE**—There is no hope of success for the person who does not have a central purpose, or definite goal at which to aim. Ninety-eight out of every 100 of those whom I have analyzed, had no such aim. Perhaps this was the major cause of their failure.
3. **LACK OF AMBITION TO AIM ABOVE MEDIOCRITY**—We offer no hope for the person who is so indifferent as not to want to get ahead in life, and who is not willing to pay the price.
4. **INSUFFICIENT EDUCATION**—This handicap may be overcome with comparative ease. Experience has proven that the best-educated people are often those who are known as “self-made,” or self-educated. It takes more than a college degree to make one a person of education. Any person who is educated is one who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without violating the rights of others. Education consists, not and persistently applied. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more particularly for what they do with that which they know.
5. **LACK OF SELF-DISCIPLINE**—Discipline comes through self-control. This means that one must control all negative qualities. Before you can control conditions, you must first control yourself. Self-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self. You may see at one and the same time both your best friend and your greatest enemy, by stepping in front of a mirror.
6. **ILL HEALTH**—No person may enjoy outstanding success without good health. Many of the causes of ill health are subject to mastery and control. These, in the main are: *(a.)Overeating of foods not conducive to health; (b.)Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to negatives; (c.)Wrong use of, and overindulgence in sex; (d.)Lack of proper physical exercise*
7. **UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES DURING CHILDHOOD**—“As the twig is bent, so shall the tree grow.” Most people who have criminal tendencies acquire them as the result of bad environment, and improper associates during childhood.
8. **PROCRASTINATION**—This is one of the most common causes of failure. “Old Man Procrastination” stands within the shadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil one’s chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures, because we are waiting for the “time to be right” to start doing something worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be “just right.” Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
9. **LACK OF PERSISTENCE**—Most of us are good “starters” but poor “finishers” of everything we begin. Moreover, people are prone to give up at the first signs of defeat. There is no substitute for persistence. The person who makes persistence his watch-word, discovers that “Old Man Failure” finally becomes tired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with persistence.
10. **NEGATIVE PERSONALITY**—There is no hope of success for the person who repels people through a negative personality or a lack of confidence. Success comes through the application of power, and power is attained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative personality will not induce cooperation.
11. **LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE**—Sex energy is the most powerful of all the stimuli which move people into *action*. Because it is the most powerful of the emotions, it must be controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other channels.
12. **UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR “SOMETHING FOR NOTHING**”—The gambling instinct drives millions of people to failure. Evidence of this can be seen in the Wall Street crash of 1929, during which millions of people tried to make money by gambling on stock margins.
13. **LACK OF WELL-DEFINED POWER OF DECISION**—Men who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at all, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly, and change them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and procrastination are twin brothers. Where one is found, the other may usually be found also. Kill off this pair before they completely “hog-tie” you to the treadmill of failure.
14. **ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX BASIC FEARS**—People often fail to take action because they are paralyzed by one or more of the six basic fears: *(a.)Fear of poverty; (b.)Fear of criticism; (c.)Fear of ill-health; (d.)Fear of the loss of love of someone; (e.)The fear of old age; (f.)The fear of death*
15. **WRONG SELECTION OF MATE IN MARRIAGE**—This is a common cause of failure. The relationship of marriage brings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is harmonious, failure if likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form of failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all signs of ambition.
16. **OVER CAUTION**—The person who takes no chances, generally has to take whatever is left when others are through choosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are extremes to be guarded against. Life itself is filled with the element of chance.
17. **WRONG SELECTION OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATES**—This is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In marketing personal services, one should use great care to select an employer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself, intelligent and successful. We emulate with whom we associate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating.
18. **SUPERSTITION & PREJUDICE**—Superstition is a form of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep open minds and are afraid of nothing.
19. **WRONG SELECTION OF VOCATION**—No man can succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like. The most essential step in the marketing of personal services is that of selecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself wholeheartedly.
20. **LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT**—The jack-of-all-trades is seldom good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on one definite chief aim.
21. **HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING**—The spend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in fear of poverty. Form the habit of systematic saving by putting aside a definite percentage of your income. Money in the bank gives one a very safe foundation of courage when bargaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must take what one is offered, and be glad to get it.
22. **LACK OF ENTHUSIASM**—Without enthusiasm one cannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the person who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any group of people.
23. **INTOLERANCE**—The person with a “closed” mind on any subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has stopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging form of intolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political differences of opinion.
24. **INTEMPERANCE**—The most damaging forms of intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success.
25. **INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS**—More people lose their positions and their big opportunities in life, because of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a fault which no well-informed business man, or leader will tolerate.
26. **POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NO ACQUIRED THROUGH SELF-EFFORT**—(Sons and daughters of wealthy men and others who inherit money which they did not earn.) Power in the hands of one who did not acquire it gradually is often fatal to success. Quick riches are more dangerous than poverty.
27. **INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY**—There is no substitute for honesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of circumstances over which one has no control, without permanent damage. But, there is no hope for the person who will catch up with him, and he will pay by loss of reputation, and perhaps even loss of liberty.
28. **EGOTISM AND VANITY**—These qualities serve as red lights which warn others to keep away. They are fatal to success.
29. **GUESSING INSTEAD OF THINKING**—Most people are too indifferent or lazy to acquire facts with which to think accurately. They prefer to act on “opinions” created by guesswork or snap judgements.
30. **LACK OF CAPITAL**—This is a common cause of failure among those who start out in business for the first time, without sufficient reserve of capital to absorb the shock of their mistakes, and to carry them over until they have established a reputation.

**SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF POVERTY**

* **INDIFFERENCE**—Commonly expressed through lack of ambition; willingness to tolerate poverty; acceptance of whatever compensation life may offer without protest; mental and physical laziness; lack of initiative, imagination, enthusiasm and self-control.
* **INDECISION**—The habit of permitting others to do one’s thinking. Staying “on the fence.”
* **DOUBT**—Generally expressed through alibis and excuses designed to cover up, explain away, or apologize for one’s failures, sometimes expressed in the form of envy of those who are successful, or by criticizing them.
* **WORRY**—Usually expressed by finding fault with others, a tendency to spend beyond one’s income, neglect or personal appearance, scowling and frowning; intemperance in the use of alcoholic drink, sometimes through the use of narcotics; nervousness, lack of poise, self-consciousness and lack of self-reliance.
* **OVER-CAUTION**—The habit of looking for the negative side of every circumstance, thinking and talking of possible failure instead of concentrating upon the means of succeeding. Knowing all the roads to disaster, but never searching for the plans to avoid failure. Waiting for “the right time” to begin putting ideas and plans into action, until the waiting becomes a permanent habit. Remembering those who have failed, and forgetting those who have succeeded. Seeing the hole in the doughnut, but overlooking the doughnut. Pessimism, leading to poor elimination, auto-intoxication and bad disposition.
* **PROCRASTINATION**—The habit of putting off until tomorrow that which should have been done last year. Spending enough time in creating alibis and excuses to have done the job. This symptom is closely related to over-caution, doubt and worry. Refusal to accept responsibility when it can be avoided. Willingness to compromise rather than put up a stiff fight. Compromising with difficulties instead of harnessing and using them as stepping stones to advancement. Bargaining with Life for a penny, instead of demanding prosperity, opulence, riches, contentment and happiness. Planning what to do if and when overtaken by failure, instead of burning all bridges and making retreat impossible. Weakness of, and often total lack of self-confidence, definiteness or purpose, self-control, initiative, enthusiasm, ambition, thrift and sound reasoning ability. Association with those who accept poverty instead of seeking the company of those who demand and receive riches.

**SYMPTOMS OF FEAR OF CRITICISM**

* **SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS**—Generally expressed through nervousness, timidity in conversation and in meeting strangers, awkward movement of the hands and limbs, shifting of the eyes.
* **LACK OF POISE**—Expressed through lack of voice control, nervousness in the presence of others, poor posture of body, poor memory.
* **PERSONALITY**—Lacking in firmness of decision, personal charm, and ability to express opinions definitely. The habit of side-stepping issues instead of meeting them squarely. Agreeing with others without careful examination of their opinions.
* **INFERIORITY COMPLEX**—The habit of expressing self-approval by word of mouth and by action, as a means of covering up a feeling of inferiority. Using “big words” to impress others, (often without knowing the real meaning of the words). Imitating others in dress, speech and manners. Boasting of imaginary achievements. This sometimes gives a surface appearance of a feeling of superiority.
* **EXTRAVAGANCE**—The habit of trying to “keep up with the Joneses,” spending beyond one’s income.
* **LACK OF INITIATIVE**—Failure to embrace opportunities for self-advancement, fear to express opinions, lack confidence in one’s own ideas, giving evasive answers to questions asked by superiors, hesitancy of manner and speech, deceit in both words and deeds.
* **LACK OF AMBITION**—Mental and physical laziness, lack of self-assertion, slowness in reaching decisions, easily influenced by others, the habit of criticizing others behind their backs and flattering them to their faces, the habit of accepting defeat without protest, quitting an undertaking when opposed by others, suspicious of other people without cause, lacking in tactfulness of manner and speech, unwillingness to accept the blame for mistakes.

Experimenting with diets, extreme physical exercises, reducing systems, without professional guidance. Trying home remedies patent medicines and “quack” remedies.
* **HYPOCHONDRIA**—The habit of talking of illness, concentrating the mind upon disease, and expecting its appearance until a nervous break occurs. Nothing that comes in bottles can cure this condition. It is brought on by negative thinking and nothing but positive thought can affect a cure. Hypochondria, (a medical term for imaginary disease) is said to do as much damage on occasion, as the disease one fears might do. Most so-called cases of “nerves” come from imaginary illness.
* **LACK OF PROPER EXERCISE**—Fear of ill health often interferes with proper physical exercise, and results in over-weight, by causing one to avoid outdoor life.
* **SUSCEPTIBILITY**—Fear of ill health breaks down nature’s body resistance, and creates a favorable condition for any form of disease one may contact. The fear of ill health often is related to the fear of poverty, especially in the case of the hypochondriac, who constantly worries about the possibility of having to pay doctor’s bills, hospital bills, etc. This type of person spends much time preparing for sickness, talking about death, saving money for cemetery lots, and burial expenses, etc.
* **SELF-CODDLING**—The habit of making a bid for sympathy using imaginary illness as the lure. (People often resort to this trick to avoid work.) The habit of feigning illness to cover plan laziness, or to serve as an alibi for lack of ambition.

* **JEALOUSY**—The habit of being suspicious of friends and loved ones without any reasonable evidence of sufficient grounds. (Jealousy is a form of dementia praecox, which sometimes becomes violent without the slightest cause). The habit of accusing wife or husband of infidelity without grounds. General suspicion of everyone. Absolute faith in no one.
* **FAULT FINDING**—The habit of finding fault with friends, relatives, business associates and loved ones upon the slightest provocation, or without any cause whatsoever.

Insomnia, nervousness, lack of persistence, weakness of will, lack of self-control, lack of self-reliance, bad temper.

**SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF OLD AGE**

* **INFERIORITY COMPLEX**—The tendency to slow down and develop an inferiority complex at the age of mental maturity, around the age of forty, falsely believing one’s self to be “slipping” because of age. (The truth is that man’s most useful years, mentally and spiritually, are those between forty and sixty).
* **NEGATIVE AUTO-SUGGESTION**—The habit of speaking apologetically of one’s self as “being old” merely because one has reached the age of forty, or fifty, instead of reversing the rule and expressing gratitude for having reached the age of wisdom and understanding.
* **SELF-DOUBT**—The habit of killing off initiative, imagination, and self-reliance by falsely believing one’s self too old to exercise these qualities. The habit of the man or woman of forty dressing with the aim of trying to appear much younger, and affecting mannerisms of youth; thereby inspiring ridicule by both friends and strangers.

**SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF DEATH**

* The habit of thinking about dying instead of making the most of life, due, generally, to lack of purpose, or lack of a suitable occupation. This fear is more prevalent among the aged, but sometimes the more youthful are victims of it. The greatest of all remedies for the fear of death is a burning desire for achievement, backed by useful service to others. A busy person seldom has time to think about dying. He finds life too thrilling to worry about death. Sometimes the fear of death is closely associated with the rear of poverty, where one’s death would leave loved ones poverty-stricken. In other words, the fear of death is caused by illness and the consequent breaking down of physical body resistance. The commonest causes of the fear of death are; ill-health, poverty, lack of appropriate occupation, disappointment over love, insanity, religious fanaticism. ",11,1738420020.0,CountryDumb,0,1.0,False

Her different personality performances depending on what she is posting is so cringe to me!!! 

There are a lot of examples of her doing this but this is just the most recent I decided to compare. 

In the what I eat in a day vid she is trying to display clean girl, soft spoken, Pilates princess, delicate ,demure, mindful…moves her coffee from the Keurig with such grace and she is making her voice soft like Nara smith videos. Which is just not her personality at all 


In the ramen video her whole personality is abrasive, talking about wrecking the toilet, making a disgusting unhealthy meal, slurping. cussing etc. 
which I assume is more true to her personality (which is fine like whatever that’s who you are lol) 

But the performative fake aesthetic is just weird as hell and someone should conduct a psychological study on this woman.

But giving up spicy food, chai, chocolates and so many other normal foods for life feels too much. The gastro docs can’t even cure mild gastritis? What’s the point of them then?

Being the first day of the month, it got me thinking to how in the past they would give us 2-3 deals to start the month, there was also the weekly deal drop, not to mention how last year they gave us $2 medium coffees for a long time.

Is any of this coming back? Are we stuck with what we have and eventually even the 100 bonus points on Monday will go away? Just so disappointed in the lack of deals not because I expect them, but because I remember what we once had.

Can I get advice from anyone who quit cold turkey? Anyone can chime in but i just cant use the patch or gums. Inhaler isn't really doing it for me either.. How did you stick to the quit date you planned and not push it to tonight/tomorrow/just this pack?
Did you cut out other habits in the process? Like not so healthy snacks and coffee?
Did you wake up the first morning on autopilot and forget you were supposed to be quitting?

I've read Allen Carrs book. It helped for about a week a few years ago but I've since re-read it twice but didn't stick. Should I try again?

I really want this. I cant deal with the pains anymore.

I Have a real heart and real feelings that I often wear on my sleeve. Most of all, I know that you are real too and will truly treat you with dignity and respect and not discard you like a commodity. 

My faith in the goodness is others leads me to believe that we can both cheer each other during our tough times. Really get to know each other . Hopefully you truly look past my soulful blue eyes and really get to know me , the real me that is tucked inside my beating heart and happy soul.
