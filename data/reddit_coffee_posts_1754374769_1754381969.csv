1mi3g7r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mi3g7r,Decluttering Al rehab- French Coffee,"**Bought for(Receipt attached)**: 1500

**Selling for**: 980 +shipping

**Seller:** Muzzamil Nayanj( one of the most trusted sellers- you can check r/desifragranceaddicts. This is an authentic product)

**Quantity:** ~90-95 ml/100ml I used only for 2 days but I'd rather underestimate the quantity than overestimate it to sell. I can put it in the fridge and show you the condensation level if you want(haven't done so because some people say it'd damage the perfume). I can also scratch the back and show you the level of perfume left but that would damage the bottle so please be sure that you'd buy that damaged bottle if you want me to verify through these methods. Other than that I have no problem testing it out for you.

**Reason for selling:** It was projecting like crazy in summer. I was saving it for winter(thought the humidity was a factor) but it is too heavy for me in the sense that its sillage is crazy and the scent of gourmand is creamy sexy that I can't wear it in the office. I have Studiowest Goddess and that is an inoffensive scent that becomes a skin scent in a few hours. That cheapie is more suited in the office setting for me, otherwise my colleagues might think I'm wearing to seduce them(unless of course you want to smell like a delectable cookie to your boss). Anyway that kind of bold gourmand personality- I can't carry in public.

**Scent:** It is creamy gourmand with coffee and sprinkled caramel notes. One day I put it in the morning and I got whiffs in the air the whole day, night and the next day when I woke up. This kind of projection and sillage is not for me.

**Best layering combos:** I think Ar rehab choco musk attar would be the best(like smelling chocolate coffee caramel all in one go). Or if you want to forego the creamy aspect, you can layer the base with sandalwood perfume(cheap ones like the one sold by Karnataka government authentic Mysore sandal extrait). It is so cheap you guys.

If you are like me though and want to something to be a skinscent in office etc, this one is not for me. It is more sexy.


**Shipping:** Can send via Rapido if you are in Chennai and you can get it in mins. Or else can send it via shiprocket(this will be my first time though). Or any other courier service the buyer is comfortable with.",1,1754381894.0,IndianBeautyDeclutter,0,1.0,False

So Cooling - So Needed (first 1 in years),"I am already grateful daily when I make my daily stop to the same place daily as they have free coffee for anyone that stops in, and not just any coffee.... really flavorful delicious, best in the city, ; ) coffee.

But, seeing as I am a person that hates waste and throwing stuff away, especially when others may need, enjoy, benefit from it, ... it has always bothered me to see them spilling out 1 - 1 1/2 urns of coffee, every day at the end of the day. I always try to let people know the coffee will be spilled down the drain and let late comers know there is lots left and encourage them to drink some.

So for some reason for 2 days in a row - there are 3 massive full urns of coffee at the end of the day both days. As I am carrying on about throwing so much away, the managers is also surprised to learn there are 3 full urns and is also saddened about it all being spilt out.

He says he will put it in the fridge and make ice coffee for the next day. I think that is a marvelous idea. I am quite delighted  and make comments about him coming up with such a good idea and having such good thinking, all the while not necessarily believing that it will actually happen as they often are just short staffed, frazzled, overwhelmed and often the things they promise -dont actually end up happening. I dont quite believe it and as time passes closer to the end of the day, 1-2 times I as if they still have it or if they threw it out. Sounded like they kept it but wasn't sure.

Next day, I had forgotten all about it. I walked a brisk walk for 25 min with little hydration, due to running late, and the heat was sweltering, perhaps one of the hottest days of the summer thus far. I am sweating and dripping water down my face and oh.... so.... thirsty.

I start guzzling water and then am asked if I want some ice coffee.

OMG ! I am so thrilled to hear they actually made it, but brace myself as I cannot take high syrupy tasting sugar drinks but visions of ice cubes in coffee are dancing through my mind. I cross my fingers and with hope and hesitancy, I ask if it is loaded with sugar and told, nope, no sugar in it.

Well... alright then, YES Please ! : )

And omg, how cold and creamy and yummy and delicious and cooling.

I am so happy he had such a smart idea of how to use the excess coffee and so happy he actually followed through.

My finances dont permit me to buy things like this and it had been forever since I had had one, maybe years ago, just a sip or two from my ex's ice coffee.

My God, this was delicious and what a cold and welcomed delight.! Super appreciated !!

I was so grateful for this ..................................................(made with free coffee/available) ................................. - this wonderful, quenching, lovely, oh so yummy, lovely, oh so cooling ice coffee. Very appreciated. So Much Enjoyed. Grateful.",2,1754381321.0,gratitude,0,1.0,False
1mi3ag9,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mi3ag9/my_undiagnosed_brother_pisses_me_off/,My Undiagnosed Brother Pisses Me Off,"I have an older brother (20m) and he’s the most annoying person in my life right now. Back when he was in the 2nd grade, a school counselor told our mom that she suspects he has autism, but our mother took offense to that and took him out of the school instesd of listening. Since then, she’s ignored his symptoms (which mainly included talking to himself and having out of context facial reactions, making him look delusional) and they’ve only gotten worse with age. To get off the main topic for a second, around his fifth or sixth grade year, he revealed to me another weird aspect of his personality. I was in second grade at the time, and my sister lived with us and slept in the basement. There was a bathroom there, so she’d shower and change in the basement, too. That said, I remember for a few months, he would tell me about his attempts to leave his Ipad at the basement, hoping to secretly record her changing. I would always intervene somehow without letting anyone know because I thought snitching was bad, so his attempts were thankfully never successful. Regardless, he still tried until I realized he was being an absolute creep fr fr and I told my dad through text. He called me a snitch, but to my knowledge he had no lasting hard feelings toward me. It definitely sullied my opinion of him though, especially as I realized the severity of the situation.

Back to the main subject, his mental condition. As I said before, his self conversations got worse with age and it became evident that he used that as an outlet to vent his frustration. Totally fine and could be healthy, right? Well, it began bleeding into his reality and it was clear that he could rarely ever separate what was in his head to what was real. These “outbursts” were somewhat rare while he was a teen and only became frequent once he hit 18. Then, he went off to college. His whole life he’s been ego-syntonic (as in he never thought his behavior was abnormal) and unfortunately, his university couldn’t keep up with him. I don’t know if this is a side effect of his condition or whatever, but he does take a long time in the bathroom (not so much anymore as this was almost 2 years ago) and whenever he is called out for it, he flips out. He never thinks he’s in the wrong even if he’s waiting everyone’s time for himself, bathroom or not. That said, this behavior showed up in college and his roommates were quickly sick of it. From what I know (mind you this was only 2 months into college) they called campus security, my brother said something about a gun, he was brought to the dean’s office to explain himself, said he was hearing voices in his head, and then admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Only reason my parents knew was because they tried calling him and it went to voicemail, but his location never changed so they called the school. He stayed in the hospital for three days before they let him go with a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder. After a week of being back, he stopped taking his meds and my mom let him. He also gained restrictions at the college, broke them, and was kicked out.

Now most recently, six months ago he was diagnosed with diabetes. This seemed to amplify whatever problems and outbursts he had before as they multiplied after this diagnosis. Initially, I figured it was normal since it is a life-changing thing, but it became clear that it just made his condition worse and wasn’t really temporary. The first day he was back from the hospital, he was yelling and slamming doors. He didn’t want to talk to anyone and was angry for days. Fair enough given the gravity of the situation. However, to this day it’s continued. To sum it up, occasionally he’ll be downstairs chilling or eating, or taking a shower and I’ll start hearing thuds and stomps and loud grunts. It’s gotten bad enough to the point where my mom was scared and finally lcoked in to want to get him help, but unfortunately since he’s an adult she can’t do much (unless he hurts himself or others). She’s gotten me to take videos just in case she needs to show evidence in the event of anything happening. This usually happens in the middle of the night, waking up and pissing off my parents. It happens almost every other day now, daytime or nighttime, and whenever my parents try to ask what’s wrong he’ll brush them off or say something along the lines of “You don’t understand”, “It’s not in my head it’s real” or “This is your fault”. He does sometimes blame my parents for what they did to him at a younger age, but I never know what he’s referencing as he was treated the same as me and my other brother, and significantly more kindly than my sister (which honestly teetered on abuse, but african parents don’t understand that for some reason). She’s treated much nicer now that she’s grown up and even more when she moved out, though. Anyway, my point is his behavior and mental state has gotten worse and it’s become so frequent that I no longer find it concerning, just straight up annoying. It doesn’t help that he acts like a man child all the time and lacks basic decency and knowledge. At his big age, he didn’t understand that coffee blends needed to be brewed, not mixed in like instant coffee. He also rarely cleans up after himself unless told to do so and often leaves the toilet seat dirty. As I said before, he doesn’t take criticism well either and gets defensive, especially towards my parents even when they’re being reasonable (like telling him to not stay out past 12 am or charge his phone before he leaves the house cause it always dies). 

Sorry for the yap sandwich. I don’t necessarily need any advice, just needed an outlet since I feel like I need to get this out there, aside from my family. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, and if you happen to have any idea of what he might have, I’m all ears. Maybe we can find a solution",1,1754381270.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Like, should I reallly keep doing this to myself? 

First, there was knitting. I was convinced I'd make everyone sarves for Christmas. Cut to a week later, I had like a quarter of a scarf done, and let's just say it wasn't runway-ready. Then came watercolors. Bought all the fancy brushes, sketchbooks... even joined a couple of subredidts. Now? They're collecting dust right next to my half-knitted scarf. 

Lastly, the ukulele phase. Colud barely play 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' without making it sound like a dying cat, tbh.

1mi36jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1mi36jd/meaningful_holidays_three_simple_gestures_for_a/,Meaningful holidays: three simple gestures for a kinder life,"August arrived. The cities empty, the towns fill, the clock slows down... and many of us finally sigh. For some people, this month is the most anticipated month of the year. For others, an uncomfortable pause, a parenthesis that does not always bring rest. And it is not unusual to ask:
What happens if I go on vacation but don't leave myself?

Disconnecting is not just changing places. It is, above all, changing your internal tone. That's why today I propose three minimal gestures—almost invisible—that can make a big difference. They don't cost anything. They do not require wifi. But they can give you something essential back: the peace of being with you without the need to escape.


1. Lower the happiness bar

There is a phrase that can change the day:
“Today I am going to set the bar for happiness very low.”

It's not giving up. It is learning to look. Savor the coffee without rushing, notice the breeze that comes through the window, enjoy a chat without filters. This practice has a name: positive savoring and has been studied by positive psychology as a powerful tool to increase well-being (Bryant & Veroff, 2007).

And the most curious thing? It doesn't make you conformist. On the contrary: it fills your emotional tank to face challenges. According to Barbara Fredrickson, positive emotions, even the smallest ones, expand our cognitive and emotional resources (Fredrickson, 2001).

Ask yourself today:
	• What small detail has made me smile?
	• Am I knowing how to value what I have without stopping imagining more?


2. Do something for someone, even if it's small

An outstretched hand, a real listening, a sincere message. There is no need to change anyone's life. It's enough to be there for someone. What happens when we do it is not anecdotal: it is neurobiology. Helping others activates brain circuits linked to reward and connection, such as the dopaminergic system and the vagus nerve (Moll et al., 2006).

Additionally, practicing compassion and generosity is associated with higher levels of oxytocin, the bonding and well-being hormone (Zak, 2005).

And the beautiful thing about August is that, with less noise and less hurry, we can open that space more easily.

Ask yourself:
	• Who could I accompany today, without expectations?
	• What small gesture could have a real impact?


3. Treat yourself with more affection

Vacations don't always bring calm. Sometimes we continue to carry within ourselves the critic, the one who demands, the one who compares. Therefore, a clear proposal: lower the volume of the internal judge. You don't need to make it perfect. You need to take care of yourself.

Self-compassion—that is, treating yourself as you would treat someone you love—has been shown in multiple studies to reduce anxiety, increase resilience, and improve emotional regulation (Neff, 2003; Neff & Germer, 2013). It's not self-indulgence: it's mental health.

Ask yourself honestly:
	• Am I being demanding or careful with myself?
	• What do I really need today?


You don't need a spectacular summer. You don't need to fill your phone with photos to feel that it was worth it. Sometimes the best moments are not uploaded to any network. They stay inside. In an instant where you feel like you are coming back to you.

Because resting is not always stopping.
Sometimes, it's remembering that matters.

When I wake up in the morning, I turn on the light-they immediately see the light on in my room from under the door. They used to just come in, and hubby and I told them they have to knock first and I began to lock my door. But now that means they knock incessantly. ""I need five mins"" doesn't suffice. They knock every one minute. They just want to sit and talk, it isn't that urgent. 

At night, they insist on watching these annoying TV shows that I do not find entertaining. After a long day of work I want to sleep. So after spending 2 hours with them at dinner I go to bed...sure enough, they knock and wake me up 30 mins later saying ""But this show is SO funny you have to come watch""

Other times I'll be in my room, working on my laptop-they'll come in, sit with their tea and coffee and proceed to disturb me. 

Why is it expected that as a DIL, I have to be available to entertain them 24/7? They live alone so surely they had other means of entertainment before I came?

1. bet you didn't think of this one: rent out your parking space. seriously. there’s an app called Prked where you can list your empty driveway, garage, or even just a spot in your yard. with ucf so close, parking is a nightmare for students and faculty. you could rent your spot out monthly to a commuter student, which is super passive income. or if you live near downtown oviedo or any of the popular spots, you could do short-term parking for events. it’s a surprisingly good way to make money off of space you're not even using. just in oviedo, this could be a game changer.  
  
2. pet sitting and dog walking. this one is huge in oviedo. lots of families and professionals in the area who need someone to look after their pets. you can use apps like rover or just get clients through local facebook groups. it's pretty flexible and you can make decent money, especially if you're good with animals.  
  
3. tutoring, especially for ucf students. if you're good at a certain subject, you can offer your services as a tutor. math, science, and writing are always in high demand. you can do this online or meet up at a coffee shop. a lot of college students are looking for help, and you can set your own rates.  
  
4. freelance work. if you have skills in things like writing, graphic design, or web development, you can find a lot of freelance gigs online. websites like upwork and fiverr are good places to start. a lot of local businesses in the orlando area also look for freelancers.  
  
5. furniture flipping. i know a few people who do this and make good money. you find cheap or free furniture on facebook marketplace or at thrift stores, clean it up, maybe paint it, and then sell it for a profit. it takes some work but can be really rewarding.  
  
6. delivering for uber eats or doordash. this is probably the most obvious one, but it's still a solid option. you can work whenever you want, and on a good night, especially weekends, you can make some pretty good cash. with all the restaurants in and around oviedo, there's always a demand.  
  
7. seasonal retail work. around the holidays, places like bath & body works and other retail stores in the oviedo park crossing area hire seasonal help. it’s temporary, but it’s a good way to make extra money during the busiest shopping season.  
  
8. pedicab driver. this is a bit more out there, but in downtown orlando, you can make a lot of money as a pedicab driver, especially on weekends. if you're reasonably fit and don't mind the late nights, it's a fun way to earn cash.  
  
9. sell stuff on facebook marketplace. this is an easy one. go through your house and find things you don't use anymore. you'd be surprised what people will buy. old electronics, clothes, furniture... it all adds up.  
  
10. become a virtual assistant. a lot of small business owners need help with administrative tasks like answering emails, scheduling, and social media management. you can do this from home and a lot of the time the hours are flexible.  
  
hope this helps someone out. honestly, there are a lot of ways to make extra money in oviedo if you're willing to put in a little effort. good luck with your hustle",1,1754380705.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

Inside: checklists, codes, target maps, a laminated card. He thought, absurdly, of a restaurant menu. Except this one listed annihilation, devastation, extinction.

His advisors’ voices blurred, rising and falling like a distant tide. The words ***“responsibility,”*** ***“deterrence,”*** ***“survival”*** hung in the air like flies. He saw flashes: a girl’s skipping rope, a dog sleeping on a porch, a schoolyard in morning sun. 

Did the enemy’s children laugh the same way? Was someone, somewhere, tucking their child into bed now, beneath the path of his wrath?

He alone had the authority to end the world in minutes, with no one able to intervene. He felt the weight of it, a stone pressing down on his lungs. Sole authority. Sole survivor. *Sole monster.*

He wanted anyone to tell him no, to shoulder the blame. The thought was childish, monstrous, and true. ***“God forgive us,”*** he whispered, barely audible, and gave the order.

Across the continent, in silos and submarines, the command was received. Twin keys turned in distant bunkers. Rockets ripped the sky, howling toward countries he would never see, faces he would never know. The map bloomed with launch arcs, digital comets spelling out apocalypse.

A new dread seized him: the missiles’ path would carry them over foreign territory, over Eurasia. Advisors scrambled to open secure lines, but the hotline was silent. For one absurd moment he imagined dialing it himself, a desperate apology on his lips, ***“It’s not for you, please, wait.”*** But the world was moving faster than any plea.

Retaliation, when it came, was swift. The screen glowed red as foreign launches streaked skyward. The President felt the floor shudder. Outside, the air tore open, white light stripping flesh and thought and name. The blast wave hit, a wall of heat and sound; for a second, he glimpsed fire and rain, then darkness behind his eyelids.

In trembling dark, he bore silent witness to what he’d unleashed. Civilization’s end played out in silence, ash drifting down in sunless air. He knelt in rubble, pulse slowing, feeling smaller than any man before him.

*No one spoke his name.*

The world was gone. All that remained was the echo of a choice, 

*and dust where forgiveness might have been.*",5,1754380553.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Two separate questions:

1. I have a two year old and 5am daily morning wakeups are destroying me. 

Can anyone recommend a good coffee grinder and where I could buy coffee beans? 

I am a pleb and not coffee educated, but can’t stand the sachet stuff. I like lattes myself but the other half likes strong espresso. 

2. I’m looking to plant native Irish plants, more so flowers. Have a green area next to my apartment block that none of the kids plan on, looking to plant flowers around the edge to boost wildlife. 

There’s a hedgehog living there who emerged this year, just trying to help the fella out because apparently numbers are drastically declining. Planting native plants should give him more cover and attract bugs to eat.

I’m in the process of upgrading my setup and would love some advice.

Current Setup
	•	Grinder: Hario hand grinder 
▸ Honestly, not happy with it — it produces a very inconsistent grind, with big chunks mixed with dust.
	•	Machine: Philips 2200 Series (automatic)

What I Mostly Drink
- V60 filter coffee (daily)
- Occasional espresso drinks
- normal coffee from Philips 

What I’m Considering

Option 1:
	•	Grinder: Fellow Ode Gen 2 (for filter)
	•	Espresso machine: Sage Barista Express (for espresso)

Option 2:
	•	Grinder: Niche Zero (or Duo)


Question:

If I get the Niche instead of the Ode, what would be a good espresso machine to pair it with?
Would the Sage Barista Express still make sense, or would I be better off investing in a machine without a built-in grinder?

Other Considerations

One thing I will miss from the Philips is the “one press” coffee convenience. Any creative solutions for quickly brewing something in the morning without too much effort?


Would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you’ve used any of these setups. What would you do in my shoes?

Thanks in advance! 🙏

1mi2zd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1mi2zd4/the_trend_of_longer_game_development/,The trend of longer game development!,"As much as I'm looking forward to Elder Scrolls 6 it taking at least fifteen years to complete is ridiculous.

This recent trend of taking over ten years to develop games in a sequel or series is not a great business strategy especially if companies are trying to appeal and keep their targeted audience.

Let's say the average Skyrim fan was between fifteen and twenty-five years old on release. That would make them early thirties to forties for Elder Scrolls 6. If that trend continues or goodness forbid gets even longer those fans will most likely be late forties to early sixties for Elder Scrolls 7. 

That's only counting the gamers who were ages fifteen to twenty-five and there are probably hundreds of thousands of people who will be late forties to early sixties when Elder Scrolls 6 releases. 

That also means unfortunately statistically speaking tens of thousands of Elder Scrolls fans will pass away before ever seeing Elder Scrolls 7 if it takes fifteen or more years to make as well.

This isn't ideal for a number of reasons some of which I've already mentioned. Now I'm no expert as I'm only in my early to mid twenties but as I've gotten older I've personally noticed I have less time to play video games. 

I can no longer stay up all night on energy drinks or coffee playing the newest release without consequence. Things like work, social life, family all take up time especially as I get older. 

While I'm mainly talking about Bethesda this applies to all video game companies.

I do want fantastic storytelling and writing as well as gameplay and don't want developers cutting more corners then they already do. 

You can see they obviously don't test games before release now by them often being buggy messes that sometimes have game breaking glitches.

That doesn't mean I want to wait ten to fifteen years for each release.

There needs to be a solution to the ridiculous time game development now takes especially as before 2010 fantastic games were released within three to five years. 

Some were released with less then two years in development and became fantastic games such as Dragon Age 2 and Fallout New Vegas. 

Although DA2 and Fallout New Vegas definitely should have been in development for another year at least.

I just took one of my EPAs and looked at what was in it. Most stuff I already had in my pantry and I needed just the granola bars (don't like chocolate), the single pack sugar and coffee. 

Things I learned, I need a bigger vacuum sealer, with at least 12 Liter sucking volume, and I want for the future vacuum seal the main course instead of using the original can because of weight, also I need to tally up the calories, so that it gets to at lest 2800kcal better 3200kcal and to make sure every FFP has a similar kcal count with no lore than 100kcal difference.

Also, in addition to the granola bar, I will put an M&M pack or a Snickers in it for morale.

One important difference between an MRE and an EPA is that EPAs need an external source of heat, like an Esbit cooker and a pot. The MRE solution is comfortable, but I don't mind the pot because you can take ramen and soup cubes to make a fast snack.

There are couple of things to improve, but all in all I'm happy with the result and will never buy MRE or EPA again. ",4,1754379807.0,tacticalgear,0,1.0,False

[This clip](https://youtu.be/ATmM0ggrSes?si=8o79UT98AsWC2U-o) used to send chills down my spine.

It's just distant construction equipment, usually with crappy bearings or something that needs more grease. I used to have to do maintenance on small excavators and you wouldn't believe how quickly grit works itself into every little joint. Couple that with a worn bucket on a front loader and some decent cloud cover and boom, got yourself some “sky trumpets”.

But that's no fun. So it's actually aliens.

[Project Skyquake (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14883936) summary:

>After strange trumpet-like sounds in the sky have been reported at locations around the world, a wannabe journalist sets out to investigate with her best friend, but they soon find themselves facing an encounter with terrifying results.

Voiceover informs us that there are only 990 million people left on the planet, and nobody knows where the other billions went. The only clue is a series of recordings from a random vlogger.

Because she was the only one... on the planet... recording video...? Look it doesn't matter, that's just a silly little plot hole. Apart from that the movie's cool I promise.

So we follow a pair of besties as they go to do a documentary out in the middle of nowhere with a specialized piece of listening equipment in search of the ""sky trumpets"" phenomena, where strange noises seemingly come from the sky.

They see some chain lightning. It's neat.

They pop by a random house in the area hoping to interview them about the noises, but nobody is home. Dinner is half-eaten on the table, coffee is on the stove, water is running in the bathroom, but there's nobody there. Spooky.

And then they run into an abandoned car further out in the middle of nowhere. And the radio talks to them. And there are electrical problems. And a cult doing strange things out in the dark.

I guess I don't want to spoil anything more but suffice it to say it's a cozy time as the mystery gets deeper and the spooks get spookier. And then it ends on a melancholy sentimental note.

No blood, no gore, some basic After Effects stuff, and self-harm.

**Should you watch it?** Yeah, it's a cozy spook. It's artsy, but gives you enough visual stimulation to be entertaining. Some very creepy moments throughout. Also if you feel like getting all mopey about how it feels when loved ones disappear from your life, this is for you. Just be careful with that - [melancholy is addictive](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2YAJoAQfFZlsuHxrj85jFn?si=4b86d90253f14e60). (Dang I haven't updated this playlist in years, should take a look at it...)

It's not a slasher and it's not a wild action romp, no real chase scenes and no gore or gratuitousness, so if you want a badguy to dress up as for Halloween this isn't it.

But outside of that ya, it’s a nice watch.

Mine ended up being simple: well-fitted chinos (in khaki or dark gray), a rotation of plain crewnecks or button-downs (neutral tones), and a leather jacket for layering.

Zcash’s shielded transactions offer the strongest privacy guarantees of any distributed financial network today. They provide a cryptographic property we call “ledger indistinguishability,” which delivers strong on-chain confidentiality — far beyond what’s achievable with decoys or cover traffic that only partially masks transaction details. In short, **shielded transactions resemble random gibberish paired with a proof that it actually represents a valid payment.**

To enable this, Zcash pioneered the use of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) — a technique that allows the network to verify transactions without revealing their private contents. These proofs are called “zero-knowledge” because they reveal *nothing* about the transaction’s internals. But the cryptographic techniques behind this — particularly the proofs we use called [zk-SNARKs](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/) — are also powerful tools for building scalable decentralized systems. Their power lies not just in the zero-knowledge property itself (which is often unused in practice), but in their ability to succinctly prove the correctness of large computations.

Today, many projects use zero-knowledge (“ZK”) as a marketing term, with little to no regard for actual user privacy. **We can have the best of both worlds — a private digital payment network that scales to billions of users — by fully leveraging both zero-knowledge and verifiable computation.** We've invested heavily in making this happen, first through the [discovery of Halo](https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/) — which led to a revolution in efficient, scalable verifiable computation — and then through the [Orchard payment protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/), which laid the groundwork for the next generation of upgrades.[^(1)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#orchard)

**Now it’s time to cross the finish line.** I am proposing several protocol changes in Zcash that allow us to increasingly scale the protocol while providing a smooth transition path for existing users and wallets. The crucial component that makes this possible is a new model for how wallets interact with the blockchain that I refer to as **oblivious synchronization**. This new approach improves the user experience for wallets *and* permits an architectural change to the protocol that maintains ledger indistinguishability without incurring heavy state contention, storage and bandwidth costs for validators.

**Crucially, it is an actionable plan that does not require speculative research to see to fruition.** In the short term it can be deployed using the cryptography we're already experts at deploying in Zcash, leaving some remaining challenges for more longer-term research in the future. In order to make this happen we must pursue an engineering effort much like the “Sapling” upgrade from earlier in Zcash's history. Back then, we set out to make zk-SNARKs practical enough to run on mobile devices — a capability that’s now taken for granted. The sophistication of the Sapling upgrade (and the coordination required to pull it off) remain nearly unmatched across the entire blockchain space.[^(2)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#apollo)

Here's what it will take to raise the bar again.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#proof-carrying-data)Proof-carrying Data

Early in the history of Zcash our shielded transactions earned a reputation for being expensive due to the use of zk-SNARKs. As mentioned, the [Sapling network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) incorporated a slate of cryptographic improvements from our team[^(3)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#newcurves) and from the academic world[^(4)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#groth16) which made our proofs extremely efficient to generate. However, zk-SNARKs are also known for being slow to verify when compared to bog standard digital signature schemes. This has led to a misconception that zk-SNARKs are the cause of performance and scalability bottlenecks in Zcash.

In reality, we've never actually considered zk-SNARK verification a barrier to scaling Zcash. I once co-authored a paper[^(5)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#sonic) where we devised a method to batch verify proofs as efficiently as checking a single proof, with the help of an untrusted third party's computational resources. Later results in proof aggregation—analogous to [digital signature aggregation](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggsurvey.pdf) in other protocols—allowed multiple proofs to be *combined* and efficiently verified as a single unit, a notable example being SnarkPack[^(6)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#snarkpack) which has been deployed in some blockchains.

The ultimate tool for scaling zk-SNARK verification and a wide variety of other computationally intensive tasks in protocols like Zcash is a more general technique called **proof-carrying data (PCD)** that was originally [devised](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/docs/CT10.pdf) and even [realized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595) by the scientists behind Zcash. Crudely speaking, PCD allows data to live alongside proofs of its own correctness so that when it is combined with other (proof-carrying) data the mixture inherits and extends the original proofs of correctness. This can be used to “compress” a huge amount of verifiable computational effort, since the resulting data does not need to grow in size and there is no *practical* bound in the complexity of the inductive claims.[^(7)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#knowledge_extractors)

PCD languished for years as a theoretical tool due to performance limitations. This changed when our team at the Electric Coin Company discovered [Halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021), which was a brand new approach to achieving PCD with significantly better performance while also avoiding trusted setups and strong cryptographic assumptions. As mentioned before, this led to a Cambrian explosion of new results[^(8)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#halo) that has made PCD table stakes for new scalable protocols. PCD can be leveraged to make Zcash's blocks small and fast to verify no matter how many shielded transactions they contain, and it can even be applied to the chain itself to build fully succinct blockchains.[^(9)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#mina) As we'll be discussing, they can be used in other ways to improve our network's transaction throughput.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#communicating-state-changes)Communicating State Changes

zk-SNARKs and PCD are indispensable tools for maintaining privacy while enforcing correctness in contexts that do not involve high state contention—such as within a single transaction or across a long-term history of transactions. However, privacy-preserving protocols like Zcash involve communicating and coordinating *global* state changes because shielded transactions must be made indistinguishable from one another to reach our lofty privacy goals.

There are three major areas where this becomes a concern in our existing protocol:

* How do users learn about the payments they receive and the information they need to spend those funds?
* How do users later demonstrate that the funds they are spending actually exist?
* How are users prevented from spending funds that have already been spent?

Zcash's current protocol solves these problems in a way that is maximally convenient for the zk-SNARKs (due to legacy concerns about their performance) but otherwise very inconvenient or even impossible to scale to large numbers of users and payments. By being open to some common sense changes to the underlying cryptography and payment protocol we can take full advantage of the modern performance of zk-SNARKs and PCD.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded-notes-and-commitments)Shielded Notes and Commitments

Shielded transactions involve spending and creating “notes,” which represent an amount of funds and the key authorized to spend them — not unlike [UTXOs](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html) in Bitcoin. We aim to leak as little information as possible about the notes being spent or created in a transaction, instead allowing the zk-SNARK to prove that various rules are being followed. In order to keep newly created notes private they are encapsulated in a [cryptographic commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme) that is exposed publicly in the transaction.[^(10)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#commitments)

The commitment hides the note, but the zk-SNARK can still reason about the note because the transaction creator can open the commitment using a random, secret key. This allows the zk-SNARK proof to enforce *local* rules for things like “balance integrity” (the sum of the funds in new shielded notes does not exceed the sum of the funds being spent) and “spend authorization” (that we know the secret key associated with the notes being spent). In order for the recipient to later spend the funds they must also learn this random key and other payment information, necessitating a **secret distribution system**.

Secret distribution systems are not ordinarily needed in blockchain protocols. The standard payment flow in most cryptocurrencies works like this:

1. The user asks their wallet for a payment address.
2. The user gives this payment address to one or more other people.
3. Other people use this address to make a payment.
4. The user scans the blockchain to find all the new payments to their address.

This is how Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies work, and it's possible because addresses and payments are not private. The user can ask a third party (like a light wallet server or block explorer) for all the payments made to an address and those services can index the blockchain and answer these queries in a way that quickly enables the user to spend those funds. In private cryptocurrencies like Zcash we cannot ask a third party to identify payments sent to our payment address. In order to see incoming payments we must allow the sender to encrypt the relevant information and send it to us.

Zcash lets senders place ciphertexts inside of shielded transactions that contain note information. Recipients identify incoming payments by trial decrypting *every transaction* until they identify payments sent to them. This simply does not scale.[^(11)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#detection_keys) **As a start, we'll be assuming that Zcash's future payment flows involve out-of-band payments where the sender and recipient use a separate channel for secret distribution.** The on-chain ciphertexts can then be removed from the protocol entirely.[^(12)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#postquantum)

Fortunately, it is common for a pre-existing channel to already exist between the sender and recipient: a user paying a merchant through a web interface, someone buying coffee within physical proximity to a payment terminal, or friends resolving dinner debts over Signal chats. In these cases the [payment request](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0321) model that is supported by most Zcash wallets (and commonly found in most cryptocurrencies) accomodates out-of-band payments. It is even possible for payments to be sent to recipients out-of-band without a payment request through the use of “liberated” or [URI-encapsulated payments](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0324).[^(13)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#liberated)

There are some drawbacks that have to be addressed separately. By moving secret distribution out-of-band the user cannot rely on the blockchain as a storage mechanism for recovering their funds from a seed phrase or sharing transaction histories with view keys. Also, the ability to give a payment address away publicly (like posting on a billboard to solicit anonymous donations) does not inherently work.[^(14)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#billboards) In order to support these use cases we will need additional infrastructure for our wallets to store and distribute payment information privately. This at least makes sense from an economic perspective, since the blockchain currently provides for these use cases for free at great systemic cost.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#accumulators-and-nullifiers)Accumulators and Nullifiers

In order to spend a shielded note that has been previously created, validators continually append the new note commitments that appear in shielded transactions to a [cryptographic accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(cryptography)). Currently, at block boundaries, the accumulator is checkpointed and a succinct (hash) representation of that checkpoint is stored by validators. We call this checkpoint an “anchor.” In order to spend a note later, shielded transactions demonstrate that the note they are spending exists at some (usually recent) anchor that validators accept as valid.

In order to maintain privacy, while shielded transactions must publicly identify the anchor (for validators to check) they do *not* need to identify the actual note commitment they are spending. This works because a **set inclusion witness** that demonstrates a commitment exists within an accumulator can be short and easy to verify, and so the zk-SNARK proof in a transaction can be used to demonstrate *knowledge* of such a witness without revealing it publicly.

If we do not identify the note being spent, how do we demonstrate that it has not been spent by another transaction? **The zk-SNARK helps us verifiably compute a value called a nullifier that is deterministically derived in some way from the note we are spending.** The nullifier itself does not reveal anything about the note, but because it is forcibly disclosed within the transaction it serves as an indelible mark on the chain state that prohibits double-spends. Validators currently remember all of the nullifiers seen before and reject payments as invalid if they reveal a previously-seen nullifier.

**The scalability bottlenecks that remain in Zcash center around how wallets synchronize with these particular blockchain state changes.** Currently, even with out-of-band payments, *every* time *any* user creates a shielded transaction in Zcash:

* the network must ensure that the revealed nullifier has never been seen before;
* the network must record the nullifier so that it cannot be repeated again; and,
* all other users must account for the newly created note commitments by updating their set inclusion witnesses for all of their unspent shielded notes, to reflect a more recent anchor.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#oblivious-synchronization)Oblivious Synchronization

It'll be helpful to recast what a Zcash wallet does through the lens of an abstract machine, focusing (without loss of generality) on the case that the wallet only receives and later spends a single shielded note.

The wallet starts in some *initial* state (at some point in the blockchain) and processes blocks one at a time. In each block, it attempts to find a new note commitment that it expects to find based on the out-of-band process mentioned previously. Once found, the wallet enters a *synchronizing* state. In all of the blocks that follow, the wallet checks to make sure the block does not contain the nullifier for the note to ensure it has not been spent already. As long as it hasn't the wallet remains in this synchronizing state.

Finally, when the user is ready to make a transaction, they use the wallet's state to create a zk-SNARK proof and spend the funds. (The wallet's state contains, for instance, the set inclusion witness needed to spend the note with a recent anchor.) This is more or less how our wallets currently work.

My vision for scaling Zcash is to fully embrace a new model for how Zcash wallets should synchronize with blockchain state changes. Rather than using the wallet's state to merely inform the process of creating a zk-SNARK proof when it comes time to spend, **we will** ***also*** **represent our wallet's state as proof-carrying data.** This means that as the wallet state updates to reflect new blocks it will continually maintain a proof of its own correctness. Then, when it's time to spend our funds we will extend our transaction with this proof-carrying data. This effectively attaches evidence that the transaction is valid up until a certain recent point in the history of the blockchain — the position of the anchor.

The result is that validators are now only responsible for ensuring that the transaction is correct in the presence of the additional transactions that appeared in the intervening time, which just involves checking that the most recent block(s) do not contain the revealed nullifier.[^(15)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_after_commitment) As a result, almost everything in a block can be permanently pruned by validators and ultimately all users of the system as well. **Despite transactions sharing a common state by being indistinguishable from each other, nearly all state contention problems vanish in this new approach.**

It would seem for this model to work that the user's wallet will have to follow a much more expensive synchronization process to create and maintain PCD of the wallet state. This expense is not just due to the cost of creating PCD proofs but also the bandwidth needed to apply every block to the wallet state.

However, we can arrange things so that the user's wallet can outsource the process of synchronizing the wallet (and creating the PCD proofs) to a third party that I call an **oblivious syncing service**. This service isn't trusted with private information or secrets and learns nothing about the notes in the user's wallet, yet it can still make progress synchronizing its state even when the user's wallet software is offline.

We already know that this kind of approach is possible with expensive cryptography like [fully-homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) (FHE). **But by adjusting the protocol slightly we can simply use PCD.** The remote server only needs to learn the nullifier of the note to make synchronization progress without the assistance of the user's wallet, since the wallet can blind or encrypt the rest of the wallet state and only permit the oblivious syncing service to make state transitions involving the nullifier. One would expect this to reveal some information to the service about the note's possible location in the accumulator, but by adjusting how the nullifier is derived in the protocol[^(16)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#nullifier_derivation) we can eliminate this information leakage entirely, depriving the service of *any* information about the note being spent.

In practice the wallet will be handling multiple notes and thus multiple nullifiers, and so an oblivious syncing service might learn more information if it can correlate requests as originating from the same wallet. But this same kind of leakage occurs already anyway when the transactions themselves are published, and so we must tackle the problem at least partially with network privacy countermeasures like mixnets. Fortunately, as I'll explain in a future blog post, even if the oblivious syncing service can correlate nullifiers we can *completely* sever the link using nifty cryptographic techniques and protocol adjustments—it's just a matter of finding the most efficient point in the trade-off space.

# [🔗](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#project-tachyon)Project Tachyon

This new model of wallet synchronization and validator state pruning can be enabled with several compartmentalized changes to the existing protocol that can happen in independent tracks, providing an immediate capacity increase in the Zcash shielded payment protocol at each step. The main changes involved include:

* **Wallets need to adopt out-of-band payments.** ECC has already begun exploring the incoporation of URI-encapsulated payments into its Zashi mobile wallet. Different kinds of out-of-band payment flows will require changes to the way existing wallets use payment requests. Fortunately, almost all of this is reverse-compatible and can be deployed without any changes to the Zcash protocol. It also leads to immediate usability wins for shielded wallets even without capacity improvements.
* **Blocks need to incorporate shielded transaction aggregation.** This involves implementing and deploying a PCD-based proof aggregation protocol for Orchard payments, which we've already been considering for years[^(17)](https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/#shielded_aggregates) and ensured the Orchard payment protocol could later accomodate. This can land in a network upgrade without any other changes to wallets or the underlying payment protocol and leads to an immediate capacity increase.
* **Nullifiers should be derived differently to prevent oblivious syncing services from learning sensitive information about wallets.** This can be achieved with a backwards-compatible network upgrade, though it will require a circuit change.
* **Nullifiers** (and potentially also note commitments) **must be batch inserted into a new accumulator that supports efficient set (non-)membership testing in PCD.** I've already sketched a very simple and efficient accumulation scheme for this. This will allow the development of oblivious syncing services without any immediate changes to the payment protocol that would risk user funds, and can be done in a network upgrade with high assurance.
* **In-band secret distribution must be removed in Zcash.** This can be achieved once wallets have migrated away from the legacy payment protocol(s). Efforts in this direction can happen independent of any protocol changes.
* **The payment protocol should allow wallet PCD state to augment the zk-SNARK in transactions.** This final major improvement allows validators to begin pruning all old blockchain state and reduces state contention considerably. This can be paired with a corresponding increase to block sizes and/or frequency.

**I call this the Tachyon project for Zcash.** I'm excited that all of these steps are possible, can be done using cryptography we are already experts in deploying, can be developed in parallel tracks, and involve few changes to the actual payment protocol. My goal is to faciliate these efforts on an ambitious timeline: many of the major scalability improvements should be able to hit mainnet within a year, while the more involved changes will depend on how quickly wallets can migrate from legacy payment protocols. As with all of our previous network upgrades I'm committed to shipping high quality code that protects our users' privacy.

Crucially, I don't plan to stand in the way of any other Zcash protocol improvements while I see Tachyon to fruition. I'm not asking the community for grants or financial assistance at this time, and I'm not asking any organizations to redirect resources to Tachyon that they think are better spent elsewhere. I also have no reason to believe that Tachyon will conflict with any of the active areas of development such as Crosslink and ZSAs; in fact, I have more reason to believe these protocol enhancements will be mutually beneficial for Tachyon.

There are many things I'll be sharing over the coming weeks. I'm most excited to publish benchmarks of a proof-carrying data toolkit that I've developed to be compatible with the Orchard payment protocol, with the goal being to set a floor on the performance of shielded transaction aggregation and oblivious syncing services. This should begin to reveal the magnitude of the scalability improvements we can expect and the complexity of the path forward.

Stay tuned, and please get in touch if you'd like to help!""

1. bet you didn't think of this one. with winter haven being the ""chain of lakes city"" and all, tons of people have boats, kayaks, and paddleboards. you could start a mobile boat and kayak detailing service. go to them at their dock or home and offer to clean their watercraft. pretty decent money in it because boat owners would rather be on the water than scrubbing the hull.  
  
2. LEGOLAND and peppa pig theme park are right here, which means tourists everywhere. instead of just driving for uber, you could market yourself as a local guide for families. offer to do grocery runs for them before they check into their rental, or put together beach-day kits for a trip to a nearby lake. people on vacation will pay for convenience.  
  
3. okay this one is super easy and passive. renting out your extra parking space with an app called Prked. honestly, its a no-brainer in Winter Haven. if you have a spare driveway spot, a space in your garage, or even a section of your yard, you can list it. people always need monthly parking for their extra car or boat trailer. and if you live anywhere near downtown or one of the popular lakes where they do the monthly ski show, you can rent your spot out for short-term cash. it's passive income and helps someone out. a win-win.  
  
4. with so many lakes, you can become a water sports helper. not everyone has a truck to haul kayaks or paddleboards. you could offer a drop-off and pick-up service for people who rent them. or, if you're good at it, offer beginner lessons for paddleboarding. you can charge a nice hourly rate for that.  
  
5. there's always something going on at Theatre Winter Haven or the historic Ritz Theatre. these places sometimes need extra hands for events. you can find work doing setup, helping with tickets, or working concessions. it’s usually just for a few hours and can be a fun way to see a show for free.  
  
6. with all the tourists, there are a ton of airbnbs around. offer your services as a turnover specialist. this is more than just cleaning – you can restock snacks and coffee, check for damages, and be the local emergency contact for guests. a lot of hosts who dont live here full-time would pay good money for a reliable person.  
  
7. there are a lot of older folks in winter haven. you could start an errand running service for them. things like picking up prescriptions, going to the grocery store, or even just providing companionship and helping with small tasks around the house. you can build a really loyal client base this way.  
  
8. now for the obvious ones. driving for uber or lyft is always an option. with the theme parks and tourists, you're not just relying on locals. you can make good money being the go-to airport driver from winter haven to MCO.  
  
9. food delivery like doordash, grubhub, and uber eats. its flexible and always in demand. you know the drill here, turn on the app when you want to work and make some cash. not glamorous but its reliable.  
  
10. seasonal work is also a good bet. LEGOLAND and other local businesses hire extra help during the busy seasons like summer and around the holidays. the pay can be pretty decent, from what ive seen on sites like ziprecruiter.  
  
anyway, the cost of living here isn't as crazy as orlando or tampa, so a good side hustle can really make a difference. hope this helps someone out. good luck with your hustle.",1,1754379040.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

So it’s Tuesday. You survived Monday (barely), and now here we are - in that weird part of the week where your coffee needs coffee and your to-do list is starting to look back at you with judgment.

Work can be this strange thing - we put in all this energy trying to do things right, make things better, be better… and sometimes the only reward is getting invited to another meeting that should have been an email.

And let’s not even start on how quiet excellence is. No parades. No confetti. Just the sound of your own brain whispering, “I could’ve done that better.”

Still, I’ve come to appreciate the quiet moments when someone says, “Hey, that thing you did - it helped.”

Here’s What I’ve Learned,"Let me tell you, a lot of people I know have this same confusion when they start looking for a [coworking space in Guwahati](https://www.exospace.in/locations/coworking-office-space-in-guwahati). I’ve been through it myself. When you search online, you’ll get a list of spaces, some fancy websites, and Instagram-worthy photos, but finding the *right* [coworking space](https://www.exospace.in/) isn’t as simple as picking the best-looking one.

I’ve hopped around a few places in Guwahati, so I thought I’d share what I learned (the hard way) for anyone who’s currently figuring this out.

# 1. Location matters more than you think

Trust me, you don’t want to spend half your energy commuting. If you’re looking around GS Road, Ganeshguri, or areas like Kamakhya Tower, check how accessible it is. How’s the parking? Is there a metro/bus stop nearby? These small things add up.

# 2. Don’t fall for photos — visit and sit for a day

Many spaces look cool online but feel dead when you walk in. I made this mistake once. Go visit, take a trial day, see the vibe. Are people actually working? Is there a community feel? Or is it just empty desks?

# 3. Understand your work style

Some people need quiet corners, others love buzzing environments. Some coworking spaces in Guwahati are more community-driven, while others are super basic (just desks and WiFi). Make sure you know what YOU want before picking one.

# 4. Check flexibility of plans

Many places will try to push you into monthly contracts, but if you’re a freelancer or remote worker, look for flexible daily or weekly plans. Also, ask about amenities. Is meeting room usage included? Do they charge extra for basic stuff like coffee?

# 5. Talk to people already working there

This helped me a lot. During trial days, I casually asked other folks working there about their experience. You’ll get honest feedback this way, whether it’s about internet reliability, management support, or even how crowded it gets at peak hours.

# Quick Tips Before You Decide:

* Prioritize location convenience over aesthetics.
* Trial a day to feel the actual working vibe.
* Make sure amenities match your workflow (WiFi speed, meeting rooms, 24x7 access if needed).
* Check if they host community events (great for networking if you’re a freelancer or startup).

I’m currently working out of a space near GS Road, and so far it’s been good not overly crowded but active enough that it doesn’t feel dead.

1mi2m4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mi2m4t/his_rejected_royal_mate/,His Rejected Royal Mate,"I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It took his grandfather’s centennial birthday for him to finally bring our son, Gale, and me home to the pack.

He swore the pack Elders had finally given us their blessing.

Our son, buzzing with excitement, bounced on the bed, clutching the champion’s medal from his junior fighting tournament.

He’d fought tooth and nail to win it, just to make his father proud.

But the moment we set foot on the Blackwood Manor grounds, we saw him.

Adrian, with his arms wrapped around a blonde she-wolf, kissing her deeply.

Adrian introduced her with a smile. ""My mate, Sophia""

Our son, Gale, rushed forward to confront him, stabbing a finger toward the seemingly perfect bite mark on my neck.

""That's the mark Dad gave Mom! You all see it!""

But the pack’s Head Elder stepped forward.

After a cursory glance, he let out a cold sneer.

""A clever trick of blood magic,"" he said with contempt. ""It can mimic a scent, but it lacks the soul-deep connection of a true mate bond. Any experienced wolf can see through it.""

I turned to Adrian, my body frozen stiff.

He turned away from me, gently stroking the real mark on Sophia's neck, which glowed with a silvery, moonlit light.

""The Blackwood pack will not accept a half-blood who can’t even shift"" he said. ""The only one fit to stand by my side is Sophia.""

I looked at him, and a bitter laugh escaped me.

To think I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood for a man like this.

Chapter 1

I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It wasn't until I walked in on him kissing his first love that I learned the mating mark he gave me was a fake.

I touched the back of my neck in disbelief.

""Eight years! You lied to me for eight whole years?!""

Everyone’s eyes were on me, but I could only see Adrian's expressionless face.

The face I had kissed countless times, the one I thought I would spend my life with.

""What is this, then?"" I ripped my collar open, revealing the delicate, crescent-shaped bite mark. ""What the hell is this?""

""Don't cause a scene, Elena,"" Adrian's voice was terrifyingly calm.

Causing a scene?

A disbelieving gasp escaped me, and I staggered back.

For eight years, I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood, turned down a career I dreamed of, and cut myself off from my friends, all because he kept insisting, ""The time isn't right.""

""I'm causing a scene?"" My voice trembled. ""You're the one who made a fool of me!""

I walked toward him, needing an explanation, needing him to say this was all a misunderstanding.

But Adrian pushed me away, his touch cold and dismissive.

Like he was shoving away a stranger, a nuisance.

""That's enough. It's time for you to go.""

That push was crueler than any words.

The whispers around us erupted into a storm of murmurs.

""Poor woman. Used as a replacement and didn't even know it.""

""Did she really think the Blackwood pack would want an outsider as their Luna?""

""Look at the kid. He's not a pureblood. Just a mutt.""

Every word was a knife, twisting in my heart.

""Adrian, please tell me this isn't real,"" my voice broke into a sob. ""We have Gale. We're a family!""

""A family?"" Sophia suddenly spoke, her voice sickeningly sweet. She glided in front of me, a victor's smile on her face. ""My dear Elena, haven't you figured it out yet?""

She stroked the true mark on her own neck, the one that glowed with silver light.

""That little trinket on your neck,"" she said, pointing at me with a perfectly manicured nail, ""cost Adrian a hundred thousand dollars. He bought it from some decrepit Blood-Sorceress.""

""It was forged in a full-moon ritual using Adrian's own blood. It doesn't just mimic a mark's scent; its true purpose was to cloud your senses and dull your instincts, trapping you in an illusion of love.""

One hundred thousand dollars.

He spent a hundred thousand dollars to weave the perfect lie.

""You've lived in that lie for eight years,"" Sophia's smile widened. ""The pack's entire inner circle knew the truth. You were the only fool kept in the dark.""

She lifted her chin smugly. ""See the difference? A real mark pulses with the heartbeat, glows softly when a mate is near. And yours? It's nothing more than a scar left by dead magic.""

My legs started to give out.

""No... that's impossible...""

""Mommy?"" Gale's timid voice cut through the noise. He was clutching his medal, his small face pale. ""Is what Dad said... true? Is the mark a fake?""

He walked cautiously toward Adrian, looking up at the Alpha he had called 'Dad' for eight years.

""Dad, tell me it's not true."" Gale’s eyes were filled with hope, the pure, innocent trust a child has for his father.

Adrian looked down at him, his eyes empty of any warmth.

""Let go."" He roughly shook off the small hand clutching his trousers.

Gale stumbled backward, his small body slamming hard into a cold stone pillar.

""Ah!"" The boy cried out in pain.

The medal clattered to the ground.

That medal was the proof of how amazing he was—proof he’d earned by training for three months, even competing with an injured arm, all so his 'dad' would see him shine.

Sophia sauntered over in her high heels.

She glanced down at the gold medal on the floor, and then, with a deliberate, cruel slowness, she brought her heel down and stomped on it.

A sharp crack echoed as the medal split in two.

""Little mutt,"" she sneered, ""you will never be worthy of the Blackwood pack.""

She ground the shattered medal under her heel, her eyes gleaming with malice. ""Just like your mother. Both of you, shameless fakes.""

""No!"" Gale cried, scrambling for it. ""That's mine!""

Seeing my son humiliated like this, something inside me snapped.

I lunged forward to protect him.

But before I could reach him, a cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

Chapter 2

""Elena.""

Victoria’s voice was like ice, each syllable laced with the authority of her rank.

Adrian’s mother, the former Luna of the Blackwood pack, stood elegantly behind me.

She walked toward the broken medal, her gaze filled with disgust.

""You shouldn't have brought this mutt to defile our sacred gathering.""

With a disdainful kick, she sent the broken medal flying toward a trash can in the corner of the garden. ""We don't welcome things of inferior blood here.""

""No!"" Gale let out a heart-wrenching scream.

He stumbled toward the trash can, his small hands digging frantically through the filth. ""That's mine… I trained for three months for that…""

His voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down his face.

I saw the bandage on his arm begin to soak with fresh blood.

For that medal, he had trained late into the night, refusing to stop even when he was hurt.

After every session, he would ask me, ""Mommy, will Dad be proud of me?""

And I always said, ""Of course, baby. Dad will see how amazing you are.""

""He is your grandson!"" I screamed at Victoria, my voice raw.

""I have no such embarrassing grandson,"" Victoria scoffed. ""A half-blood, worthy of the Blackwood name? Don't make me laugh.""

""Please…"" Gale cried, pulling the broken pieces from the trash. ""It's my most precious thing… Please don't throw it away…""

Seeing my eight-year-old son kneeling by the garbage, my heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest.

The royal blood I had suppressed for eight years began to boil, a powerful Alpha aura leaking from me, raw and uncontrolled.

""Gale, don't cry. Come to Mommy."" I tried to go to him, but Victoria blocked my path.

""Elena, control your whelp.""

""Poor little thing,"" Sophia cooed, walking up to me.

""Still daydreaming."" She suddenly gave me a hard shove.

I stumbled back, my spine slamming against the sharp edge of the stone steps.

A searing pain shot through me.

""Mommy!"" Seeing me hurt, Gale dropped the broken medal and ran toward me without a second thought. ""Mommy, are you okay?""

He was already weak from Adrian shoving him into the pillar.

He was running so fast now that his little face was flushed red.

""I'm okay, baby, I'm okay…"" I reached out for him.

But Gale's foot slipped.

Time seemed to stand still.

I saw his small body falling toward the stone steps, I saw the terror in his eyes, and I heard my own desperate scream.

""NO—""

A sickening CRACK echoed as his head slammed into the sharp corner of a step.

Blood gushed out instantly, staining the white stone red.

""Gale!"" I scrambled to him and pulled him into my arms.

My hands were immediately covered in warm blood.

""It's okay, baby, Mommy's here…"" But there was so much blood.

His little face was turning pale as paper.

""Adrian! Call the pack doctor!"" I screamed, my voice thick with tears.

Adrian just stood there, watching it all unfold with a detached expression.

""Stop the act, Elena.""

Act?

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

""Your son is bleeding!"" I shrieked hysterically.

""He's a werewolf. He has regenerative abilities. He's not going to die,"" Adrian’s voice was chillingly calm. ""Did you really think a stunt like this would win you any sympathy?""

Regenerative ability?

Gale had never shifted, never awakened his wolf.

He didn't have strong regenerative abilities!

I didn't have time to explain.

I tried to pick Gale up and run, but two pack warriors blocked my way.

""Get out of my way! He needs a doctor!""

""Ma'am, please calm down,"" one of them said, his face a blank mask. ""Don't disturb the ceremony.""

I looked back at Adrian.

He was kneeling in front of Sophia, gently fixing a strand of her hair that the wind had misplaced.

He was completely ignoring his dying son.

""Mommy…"" Gale's voice was a faint whisper.

He struggled to lift his small hand, still clutching the broken pieces of his medal.

Blood dripped from between his fingers, stark and horrifying in the moonlight.

He tried to open his eyes, looking at me with confusion and hurt.

""Mommy… I just wanted Dad… to see I was strong…""

With those words, his eyes fluttered shut, his small body going limp.

The small body in my arms was growing colder.

Chapter 3

I shoved the two warriors aside with all my strength.

""Get out of my way!"" Desperation gave me a power I never knew I had.

I scooped Gale up and ran for the main gate like a madwoman.

He felt lighter in my arms, his breathing growing fainter.

A horrifying trail of crimson marked my path on the ground.

""Hang on, baby. Mommy's taking you to a doctor.""

I reached the parking lot, fumbling to open the car door.

I jammed the key in the ignition and twisted.

Nothing.

""No, no, no…"" I twisted the key again and again.

The engine just made a choked, clicking sound before falling silent.

Someone had tampered with my car.

An image of Sophia’s triumphant face flashed in my mind.

""That bitch!"" I cursed, picking Gale up and running back.

I needed to borrow a car.

I needed to beg someone for help.

But as I reached the garden entrance, I saw a sight that shattered my heart.

Adrian was kneeling before Sophia, gently wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.

""It's okay, don't be scared,"" his voice was softer than I had ever heard it. ""That crazy woman won't bother you again.""

""Adrian, I'm begging you!"" I dropped to my knees in front of him.

Gale was unconscious in my arms, his face as white as a sheet. ""Save him! He's your blood! He's called you Dad for eight years!""

Tears blurred my vision, but I could clearly see that Adrian didn't even glance down at Gale.

""That's enough, Elena. Your act is pathetic.""

I was holding my dying son, sobbing my heart out on the ground.

He called it an act?

""He's dying!"" My voice shattered. ""He's only eight!""

""A child of my bloodline doesn't die so easily,"" Adrian said, standing up and dusting off his pants. ""I know you're jealous of me and Sophia, but you don't have to resort to such vicious lies.""

""Ma'am, I'll take you."" A young voice spoke up.

Adrian's Beta, Tyler, was suddenly beside me.

Without asking for permission, he gently took Gale from my arms.

""Quick! Get in the car!""

The car sped through the night.

I held my son tightly, feeling his life slipping away.

His body was getting colder, his breathing shallower.

""Faster, please, go faster!""

""I'm already at top speed,"" Tyler’s voice was tense. ""Hang on, we're almost there.""

But of all the terrible luck, we got into a car crash right in front of the emergency room.

""Luna, I'll handle the accident! You get Gale to a doctor! I promised the Alpha I'd take care of—""

""Doctor! Help!"" Gale was a dead weight in my arms.

I didn't hear the rest of what Tyler said.

I just grabbed my bloody son and ran inside.

The heavy doors swung shut.

The red light above the door lit up.

I collapsed onto a cold chair, my hands covered in my son's blood.

It was still warm, as if he had just been talking in my arms moments ago.

Suddenly, Adrian's voice echoed in my head through the mind link.

I took a deep breath and answered.

""Elena, where are you?"" His tone was rushed, as if he wanted to calm me down quickly. ""I know you're angry. I didn't expect my mother to do that. But trust me, this is just a temporary measure!""

""A temporary measure?"" my voice was a hoarse whisper.

""For the good of the pack, I need to mate with Sophia. But I swear to you, my heart is only with you. Once I've secured my position as Alpha…""

The good of the pack?

My son was fighting for his life, and he was talking about the pack?

""Your son is dying!""

""Enough! Stop threatening me with that. He has werewolf blood, his healing is strong enough. There's no way he's in any real danger!""

I heard a door open on his end.

Adrian, in his arrogance, hadn't even bothered to close the mind link.

""Darling, did that crazy woman give you any more trouble?"" Sophia's sweet voice dripped with venom.

""No, my love,"" Adrian’s voice was gentle.

""You're so clever, fooling her with that fake mark for so long,"" Sophia giggled. ""If I hadn't needed time to clean up my own mess in Europe, you wouldn't have been stuck playing house with her for so long.""

Playing house.

There it was again.

""Elena was just a substitute I found while you were away,"" Adrian's breathing grew heavy, as if he was lost in Sophia's kisses. ""Now that I've gotten what I needed from her, it's time to get rid of her.""

""What about the little wolf pup? Won't you feel guilty if he actually dies?"" Sophia's voice was closer now.

""Guilty about what?"" Adrian scoffed. ""He's just a mutt. He's not a threat. This is all just a game Elena is playing.""

Tears streamed down my face as I cut the link.

I couldn't listen anymore.

Eight years.

My entire eight-year union was an elaborate, carefully planned lie.

Everything I had given up for him meant nothing.

I was just a substitute, a plaything.

And my son, the boy who asked me every day, ""When is Daddy coming home?"" was nothing but a ""mutt"" to him.

The emergency room doors opened.

A doctor took off his mask and walked toward me, his eyes full of apology.

""I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. The child lost too much blood, and… he didn't have a werewolf's regenerative abilities…""

A primal howl of pure agony tore from my throat.

The next second, I threw myself onto Gale's cold, still body.

For eight long years, my Gale had lived like a rogue, never accepted by his father's pack.

I just wanted to hear him call me 'Mommy' one more time.

But now, he just lay there.

His sweet face was colorless, so quiet, as if he had never been in this world at all.

Fueled by overwhelming grief and rage, the ancient seal that had suppressed my power for eight years shattered into dust.

A primal and pure Alpha power erupted from me, so immense that every werewolf in the hospital felt it and dropped to their knees in terror.

I held Gale and cried all night.

When the sun rose, I shakily called my father to handle Gale's arrangements.

Then, I went home, clutching Gale's last belongings.

The broken medal I’d fished from the trash, and his favorite stuffed toy.

The moment I pushed open the door, the cloying, tangled scents of Adrian and Sophia hit me like a physical blow.

They dared…

On the night my son died, in our home, they were celebrating their victory.

Chapter 4

I stood in the doorway, my eyes fixed on Sophia’s coat hanging from the staircase banister.

Right where Gale used to love to slide down.

Footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Adrian descended the stairs gracefully, with a disheveled Sophia trailing behind him.

When they saw me, Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly.

""Elena, you're back."" His gaze swept over me. ""Your scent… it's different.""

He studied me, a flicker of confusion in his eyes before they iced over once more.

He straightened the cuffs of his shirt.

""Never mind. It doesn't matter. There's something I need to tell you.""

I clutched the bundle in my arms tighter.

""Tomorrow afternoon at two is my official mating ceremony with Sophia,"" Adrian announced calmly. ""The pack Elders will preside.""

""Mating ceremony?"" my voice was a rasp.

""That's right,"" Sophia said, linking her arm through Adrian's, her face glowing with triumph.

""We'll be formally bonded before the altar of the Moon Goddess. You're welcome to come. Though…""

Her eyes landed on the bundle in my arms with disgust.

""And what is that? Are you dragging that filth into my home now?""

I carefully placed the bundle on the coffee table.

""Gale is dead."" My voice was quiet, but it echoed in the silent living room.

Adrian paused his cuff-adjusting for a second, then continued.

""Elena, this act of yours is getting more and more pathetic.""

""Acting?"" I couldn't believe it. ""My son is dead!""

""Enough,"" Adrian said, his gaze cold. ""Are you still sticking to that lie? How could my bloodline not have regenerative abilities?!""

""He's really dead!"" I screamed. ""Head trauma! He bled out!""

""Then why are you here?"" Sophia sneered. ""If he were really dead, wouldn't you be busy burying him?""

She had a point.

If a child truly died, what mother would come home so quickly?

""Elena,"" Adrian shook his head. ""I can't believe your stubbornness. You've become a pathological liar.""

""It's not a lie!"" I lunged for the bundle, wanting to unwrap it and show them.

But Adrian grabbed my wrist.

""Elena, drop the act,"" his grip was like iron. ""I'm not changing my mind because of your threats.""

""Sophia will be my one and only Luna."" Every word was a dagger in my heart. ""Pack your things. Be out of here by tomorrow.""

""This is our home!""

""No, this is property of the Blackwood pack,"" Adrian corrected me. ""You were merely a temporary resident.""

Sophia smirked.

""Elena, don't be so tasteless. You've enjoyed a life that wasn't yours for eight years. You should be grateful.""

""I gave everything for this family!""

""Gave?"" Adrian scoffed. ""What did you give? You spent my money, lived in my house, and used my status to show off.""

""I suppressed who I am for you!""

""That was your choice.""

I looked at this man, the man I had loved for eight years.

The way he looked at me now, it was like he was looking at a crazy stranger.

""I told you, Gale is really dead,"" I tried one last time.

""Elena,"" Adrian's voice turned dangerous. ""If you repeat that vicious lie one more time, don't blame me for what happens next.""

""Slander?""

""Making up your child's death to get sympathy, what else would you call it?"" Sophia stood up. ""Adrian, don't waste any more time on this woman.""

I looked at the bundle on the table, which seemed to radiate a cold stillness.

No one believed me.

Even my son's death was just a performance in their eyes.

On the back of my neck, the fake mark, battered by the raw power of my unleashed royal blood, began to flake away like dead skin, revealing the pure, unblemished skin beneath.

""I'll go,"" I said, struggling to my feet. ""But you will regret this.""

""Regret what?"" Sophia laughed. ""Regret getting rid of a nuisance like you?""

I walked toward the door.

""Just you wait.""

————

Adrian's POV

The next afternoon.

The Blackwood pack's mating ceremony was held at the ancient altar of the Moon Goddess.

The Elder's voice boomed, reciting the sacred vows as every pack member watched the holy moment.

The statue of the Moon Goddess looked solemn in the candlelight.

""Adrian Blackwood, do you willingly accept Sophia as your mate…""

The ceremony was proceeding smoothly.

But Adrian couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Elena's behavior yesterday…

He had assumed she was just struggling to accept his relationship with Sophia and was acting out for his attention.

But today, she was nowhere to be seen.

He had planned to wait until this was over, until he had the full power of an Alpha, to go and explain everything to Elena.

The mark was fake, but his love for her, he told himself, had never been.

A wave of panic suddenly washed over him.

""Where is Tyler?"" He suddenly remembered telling Tyler to go help Elena last night, but he'd never heard back.

The mind link wasn't connecting.

He sent Tyler a text.

Go check on Elena and Gale. See what they're doing.

The ceremony continued.

""And now, the couple will exchange vows…""

Just then, Tyler burst into the ceremonial grounds.

He was pale, his forehead beaded with sweat.

""Alpha!"" he cried, rushing to Adrian, his voice trembling. ""Something's happened!""

Everyone stopped and stared.

""Gale… Gale is really dead!"" Tyler's voice was practically a shout. ""I just confirmed it with the hospital!""",1,1754378622.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1mi2lo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mi2lo0/aitah_for_telling_a_guy_i_just_wanted_something/,"AITAH for telling a guy I ""just wanted something casual"" after a weekend of hookups and mixed signals?","Hi Reddit,
I (25M) live in a not-so-LGBT-friendly country, so dating can be tricky. This past weekend, I had an intense and honestly exhausting experience with a guy (38M) I met through a dating app — and now I’m wondering if I was the jerk in how I ended it.

On Friday, he messaged me, had great connection and suggested meeting — not for a walk or a coffee — but straight at his place, which was an hour away. I agreed. When I got there, we had a massage, then a shower together, and things got intimate. It was genuinely one of the best experiences I’ve had in a while.

During our time together, he told me he was actually from the same country as me — but said he refuses to speak our language because it’s ""for poor people"" and that English is just better. That already gave me a weird vibe, but I let it slide.

Afterwards, he really wanted me to stay the night. I said I couldn’t because I had gym early the next morning. He kept pushing, but I left after a couple hours. We exchanged numbers. When I got home, I saw five messages from him saying he really wanted me to come back and cuddle. I didn’t respond until the next morning, explaining I had fallen asleep.

Saturday morning, he was again very forward — saying he was horny and wanted to meet. I said okay, but only if I could be home by 10AM. We met again, hooked up, and then he invited me to breakfast. During breakfast, he got pretty pushy — asking me for my full name, where I live, etc. I was uncomfortable with how fast it was all moving.

I reminded him several times that I had to leave soon, but he kept ordering more food, including dessert, saying his sister told him to try our national dish. He also wouldn’t stop talking — about his dog, about his life — and ignored the fact that I kept checking the time. Eventually I got up, said I had to go, and he walked me to the bus stop. On the way, he asked if we’d meet Sunday. I said yes, but only until 8PM.

I texted him later saying I had a nice time, but was running late to meet my gym bro. He was already annoyed that I made my gym buddy wait. Then he messaged me saying he booked us a fancy dinner for Sunday at 6:30PM (a place we had talked about), and also wanted to meet earlier for lunch and spend the whole day together.

Reminder: he also told me he was in town for a friend’s wedding on Saturday at 3PM — and now suddenly he’s planning a full Sunday with me?

Anyway, I reminded him again that I only had time until 8PM and my weekends are my only “me time.” I meal prep, clean, gym, vacuum — chores > everything else — it’s how I prepare for the week.

He went silent after that. Then at midnight, I got 3 texts asking if I was sleeping. I replied at 6AM Sunday that I hadn’t slept well and was going back to bed. He didn’t reply.

Around 12PM I texted ""how are you?"" — no answer for two hours. Then he said he was at a spa. I replied casually and kept doing my meal prep. Then he suddenly texted “I have to think.”

I was confused, then he hit me with a rant — saying I was inconsistent, didn’t want to meet for lunch, only wanted sex, that I was playing with him, wasting his time. I pointed out I did message around lunch and had never promised anything only the dinner.

He then asked if I even wanted to meet for dinner. I said yes.
He asked why. I said:

“Because you seem decent.”

That’s when he absolutely unloaded a massive scroll-length message, accusing me of lying, being fake, treating him like a hookup, playing with his feelings, etc. Said I was selfish, not serious, and just using him.

At that point, tired and mentally done, I replied:

“Yeah, I just wanted something casual.”

Was it fully true? Not really. I was just tired of the pressure and guilt-tripping. I needed the situation to stop.

He left me on read and disappeared.

So, AITAH?
Yes, we hooked up fast. But I felt like I was clear about my boundaries, my schedule, and my emotional availability. I didn’t expect him to go from hookup to emotional spiral in 48 hours. I didn’t want to be mean, but I didn’t sign up for that kind of emotional intensity from a literal stranger either.

TL;DR:
Met a guy on Friday through a dating app. Things got physical, then emotional. He got clingy, made big weekend plans, despite being here for friend's wedding, got mad when I stuck to my schedule. Accused me of just using him for sex, so I told him “yeah, I just wanted something casual” to shut it down. Now I feel weird. AITAH?",4,1754378572.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

The dates were very intense, sexually it didn't developed to penetration (thankfully) but the kissing and intensity of it all shook me to the core. Baseline is that there was no communication leading to the day, basically my role was going to be a sex mule so I quietly disconnected without drama.

My father was extremely emotionally, physically and psychologically abusive towards me and my brother. My father would also stalk me and anyone I associated with and would harass the few people I could call friends. Sometimes I genuinely wonder if at some points it would be considered torture, because of the glaring similarities I noticed when researching abuse vs torture. 

My mother was neglectful and enabled my father. He never abused her yet she continued to let him abuse me. My brother was okay up until I was 18, he has severe OCD and believed that I was a source of contamination in the house. 

In the last 2-3 years I lived there, I wasn’t allowed anywhere in the house except my room. I wasn’t allowed to cook or eat or even walk in the kitchen, sit or walk in the living room, use the washer or dryer, and would even get yelled at walking in and out of the front door. My parents allowed my brother to inflict this control over me and even blamed it on me, citing my sexuality. They provided me with a mini fridge, my own paper bowls and plates, plastic cutlery, and a drip coffee machine in my room. 

This isn’t even the tip of the ice berg of my family. 

I was low contact with them for years after moving out, only contacting them when I was in a real pinch and when I knew my mother would help because she was so desperate for reconciliation. 

But because of what happened this last december I fully just ghosted my entire family and I feel guilty about it every single day. 

This last december I was told multiple times by my boss that my father was repeatedly coming into my work, harassing my boss and coworkers and demanding they tell them my work schedule. I had a sit down conversation with my parents and told my father if he didn’t stop that he’d risk being banned from the store and/or legal charges. He denied doing anything of course. 

I eventually quit that job and got a new job. I didn’t tell my parents where I worked because I didn’t want the same thing to happen. I soft ghosted them at this time and didn’t text either of them anymore.

But one day, I see my mom at my work. She smiles and waves as if everything is hunky dory. I immediately ask her how she found me. She lies to my face multiple times saying she just shops there (she lives 2 hours away) and eventually my dad is there too joins in our little conversation. Later over voicemail my mom reveals to me that my dad went to my apartments (I still don’t know how he got my address), found my car, looked in the windows and saw my work uniform with my works logo on it, and tracked down the location. 

After this, I haven’t talked to either of them once. I finally blocked my father and I don’t respond to any of my mothers texts. Right now I’m trying to stay “safe and silent” because 1. I fear getting a restraining order will make my father actually do something, and I don’t want my new roommate to be living here in fear. 2. I can’t talk to my mom normally without addressing anything that will set my dad off. 

So it’s a mixture of safety and honesty. A part of me is screaming inside, that I haven’t tried to “actually” reconcile with my mom, that I haven’t given her a true chance and taught her exactly how she hurt me and shown her how to fix it. I feel like I haven’t given it my all, and I feel guilty every single day for not saying anything to my mom. I feel like she deserves an explaination, but I’m scared an explaination will make my dad do something crazy. ",2,1754378389.0,raisedbynarcissists,7,1.0,False

He sits, opens his laptop, and we’re both busy typing very main character energy, like two strangers with backstories. I was even lowkey romanticizing the moment sa utak ko (aminin niyo, we’ve all done it 😭).

THEN… out of nowhere, he slides a small piece of paper toward me. Akala ko ""uy, baka number niya to"" or like “What are you working on?” or “You look familiar.”

Over the past few weeks, I’ve poured a ton of late nights and coffee into building a new world radio streaming app. Think of it as a fresh take on Radio Garden.

Here’s what makes it special:

* **Interactive World Map:** Stations are displayed on a world map.
* **Flexible Browsing:** If you prefer a traditional approach, there’s a sortable, searchable list view of all stations. You can find stations by name, genre, location.
* **Favorites:** You can easily save and manage your favorite stations for quick access.

I built this app mainly as a way to seriously upgrade my Android and Jetpack Compose skills. But once it started coming together, I thought, why not share it with others who might enjoy it, too?

Just to be upfront: I did include a little monetization. Developing this took a huge chunk of time, and I’m already deep into adding support for Android Auto, which, as you can imagine, is a pretty big task. However, I’ve kept things as lightweight as possible, and if you just want to check it out for a week, there’s a totally fair option for that.

That's when I got into energy drinks and tried Aussie Lemonade for the first time. It was DELICIOUS! I do also like some of the coffee monsters, especially the Salted Caramel, but Aussie Lemonade has been my go-to.

 However, it has been getting harder and harder for me to find them in places like say Walmart, so I can't buy any in trays (which I would do so I don't have to go as often to buy more). I only had recently found out that in January it has been said that they would be slowly phasing it out and it just makes me upset. I understand that they wanna make room for new flavors, but I just don't wanna see it go. I would get some from gas stations, but if say I buy a few and bring them home to put in my fridge, and then take them to work, it would then just taste a bit watery and just not as good.

It's funny 'cause I don't even think about it... I just go. 😅 It's like my brain's on auto-pilot, sticking to what it knows, I giess. But I've recently started wondering why I do this and if it's acutally helping or hurting me.

Here's the thing: taking the same ruote every day is kinda comforting. It feels safe, ya know? I don't have to think aboout whetehr I'm gonna make a wrong turn or end up lost. But I think it might also be making me a bit lazy? Like, sticking to familiar paths means I'm mising out on potentially better routes or new dsicoveries. But breaking out of this habit feels like a task sometimes.

There's something I've learned through a bit of reading and personal reflection: our brains love familiarity. It reduces stess and decsion-making, which is great under normal circumstances. But then I wonder how much of life I'm bypassing by not exploring new routes. There was this one time when I decided to walk a different way home, and I stumbled upon this cute litte bakery I'd never seen before. I mean, hello, potential weekkend treat spot! 🧁

# start with the deal-breakers, not the brand names

before looking at any specific products, here's how to quickly eliminate the garbage:

**cyanocobalamin + folic acid** \- these are the older, cheaper versions of b-12 and folate. lots of people convert them fine, some don't. if a bottle still uses both, there are probably more shortcuts hiding underneath.

**iron by default** \- unless your last labs showed low ferritin, extra iron can backfire (gut irritation, absorption fights with zinc). most men do better iron-free.

**megadose vitamin a or e** \- fat-solubles hang around in your system, daily hammer hits aren't needed if your diet already covers basics.

**generic ""men's vitality blend"" fluff** \- tribulus, maca, longjack, etc. none belong in a baseline micronutrient stack. keep botanical experiments separate so you know what's doing what.

**proprietary dusting** \- if an ""antioxidant complex"" lists ten plants but totals 50 mg, that's marketing filler, not therapeutic anything.

ditch those and the list shrinks fast.

# five multis that clear the nonsense filter

these aren't crowned champions, they're just the ones that survived once the red flags above were stripped away. order is more vibe than ranking, and none hits every want-list point, so note the caveats.

# 1. [**benevolent**](https://globalreviewchannel.com/dp-B084P1B7DM) nourishment men's multivitamin

**why it survives:** decent zinc + magnesium spread (rare under $30), methylated b-12, and a vitamin d number that isn't either microscopic or moon-shot. ingredient list stays lean, no testosterone fairy dust tucked at the bottom.

**keep in mind:** four capsules make a serving. fine if you already juggle fish-oil or creatine pills, annoying if you'd rather forget noon refill alarms.

# 2. [**biotics**](https://globalreviewchannel.com/dp-B005P0JB78) research pro multi plus

**why it survives:** practitioner crowd swears by the bioactive b-vitamins here (p5p, methylfolate) plus trace minerals like boron and chromium most budget formulas skip. iron-free, soy-free, gluten-free for folks tracking allergens.

**keep in mind:** price lands in the way too high camp, and the heavier mineral load can churn an empty stomach. pair with food or enjoy the roller-coaster burps.

# 3. thorne basic nutrients 2/day

**why it survives:** nsf-certified batches mean less contaminant anxiety (handy for anyone in tested sports). two caps cover b's, k2, iodine, selenium without padding. thorne also avoids copper, helpful if zinc levels already wobble.

**keep in mind:** only 500 iu vitamin d and zero magnesium. plan a separate d3 + mag if you hide from the sun or crush deadlifts.

# 4. pure encapsulations o.n.e.

**why it survives:** single capsule convenience yet still squeezes in coq10 and lutein. all b-vitamins in methylated or phosphorylated forms, iron-free, low on excipients.

**keep in mind:** magnesium, calcium, and potassium are basically rounding errors here. this is a ""top-off the gaps"" play, not a stand-alone nutrient firewall.

# 5. [**nutricost**](https://globalreviewchannel.com/dp-B06WP6KQKH) multivitamin for men 

**why it survives:** went minimalist on purpose - 20 core ingredients instead of a shotgun blast. uses vegan algal dha and chelated magnesium, transparent supply chain if you're into traceability screenshots.

**keep in mind:** excludes the whole b-complex and skips vitamin c entirely. see it as a diet insurance policy, not the whole policy.

# why magnesium and omega-3s stay underdosed everywhere

multivitamins chase capsule count and price ceilings. meaningful magnesium needs \~250-400 mg elemental, which is bulky. dha/epa are oils that crowd out everything else. most brands punt those to stand-alone products. if your multi uses magnesium oxide (poor absorption) or brags ""fish-oil included"" but lists 100 mg, that's placeholder territory. plan to stack a mag glycinate or citrate plus a real fish-oil if those matter to you.

# quick lab cheat sheet before you buy

1. **check ferritin, d-25-hydroxy, b-12, and homocysteine** at least once. knowing baseline stops blind stacking.  
2. **watch copper:zinc ratio** if you run high-dose zinc for acne or immune bumps. unbalanced copper can tank energy.  
3. **if you're on trt or any hormone protocol**, revisit vitamins a & d every six months - testosterone shifts how you store fat-solubles and trace minerals.  
4. **vegans / plant-leaners** should tag on iodine and dha blood spots. most one-a-days don't shore those up enough.  

# dosing timing and gut friendliness

**split bigger servings** \- if your multi is a four-cap beast, two with breakfast, two with dinner typically cuts down nausea.

**take with fat** \- vitamins a, d, e, k ride on dietary fat. even half an avocado counts.

**coffee gap** \- caffeine can blunt mineral absorption. 30-minute buffer is usually plenty.

**watch calcium + iron combos** \- if you do take iron separately, avoid calcium-heavy meals at that time. they compete for the same transporters.

# common reddit myths worth poking

**""food-based vitamins are always better.""** reality: extraction isolates the same compounds. food blends can be gentler on digestion, but potency per capsule drops. pick based on gut tolerance, not marketing halos.

**""more is safer because excess flushes out.""** maybe true for some water-solubles, not for fat-solubles or minerals like selenium. lab work beats dose roulette.

**""multis are snake oil if you eat ok.""** nutrient databases look neat, but soil depletion, indoor jobs, and genetic quirks shift needs. a light insurance policy isn't crazy if dosing is sane.

# assembly line shopping flow i ended up using

1. pick a formula **iron-free**, **methyl-b** heavy, and within budget tolerance.  
2. tick off missing big hitters: magnesium, dha/epa, vitamin d (if under 1000 iu), maybe k2 mk-7.  
3. calculate **price per effective serving** not per bottle. four-capsules-per-day bottles run out in three weeks, not a month.  
4. set a 3-month reminder to re-check any blood markers you were chasing. keep what moved the needle, swap what didn't.  

# small note on alcohol carriers

liquid or spray multis sometimes dissolve fat-solubles in ethanol. usually <5%, but if you avoid booze entirely, scan excipient lists or stick to capsules.

multivitamins aren't magical armour, they're pothole filler. the two bottles up top (benevolent nourishment and biotics research) earned spots here by not low-balling key minerals, but any of the five could work if they line up with your diet gaps and budget. curious which combos folks here landed on, especially if you've juggled lab numbers over time - always down to see real-world tweaks rather than glossy brochure promises.

You see these incredibly sparse living rooms in LivingSpaceLounge, and while they look great in photos, I frequently enough wonder how practical they are for everyday life. Where are people putting their books, blankets, or games?

For example, a coffee table might look cleaner with just a single decorative item, but a coffee table with drawers for storing remotes, coasters, and other frequently used items is arguably more functional. Similarly, having closed storage for things like extra cushions or board games can make a space feel much less cluttered than having everything on display, even if it slightly detracts from the ""perfect"" minimalist look. There's definitely a balance to be struck, but I feel like the sub often leans heavily toward aesthetics while glossing over the practical considerations of actually living in a space.

1mi2ai4,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1mi2ai4/my_husband_and_i_open_a_lego_cafe_named_click/,My husband and I open a Lego Cafe named CLICK CLACK in Thao Dien !!!,"I'm Vietnamese, husband is American. Not a lot of thing in common from our childhood but Lego has been one of the rare thing we both got to experience. As soon as we start having disposable income, we start buying modular buildings and create a rather extensive collection (Millennium Falcon is husband's pride and joy 😁).

During COVID we decided to relocate to Vietnam and have build a life here. But corporate life gets frustrated and late last year, we decided it's time for one of us to work on sth for ourselves. We have always think Lego is not just a great toy but also a great tool to build creativity and critical thinking. The act of building Lego (and playing with it together) is also a great opportunity for people, especially kids, to socialize. It takes a few iteration and we got a lot of inspiration from around the world (special call out to The Brickery, hearing them close is a gut punch)

In the end, our business model resemble a Kid playzone with a few alteration:

* Location consist of 4 floors (\~240 sqm or \~2500 sqft in total): 2 Cafe floors (including our counters), a Lego centric floor which has a workshop room & a carpeted kid lounge, a terrace which we are setting up to be a date night type of space
* We sell Brick Pass for \~USD 8 which gives you full day access to our Lego collection (\~100 sets for now, we will keep adding to it), join any workshop activities, and if you are a kid (or have a kid with you) access to kid lounge
* You can order drinks (juice, tea, coffee) or snack (only a few pastry for now but we are working to add to it)

Our name ""CLICK CLACK"" is just the sound that comes to my mind whenever I run my hand through a bunch of Lego or putting 2 bricks together. It sounds fun so we go with it.

It's been a long journey but finally the cafe launch early July and we just have our first amazing month. I'll say 80% of our guests are family with children <13 yrs. However, we are seeing more of the adult only groups coming in. Because we purposely hire staff to play with and help kids with building, parents can also get some relax time (or working elsewhere in the cafe). The financial side haven't work out yet but thing seems promising that at least we can begin to cover the operating cost in a few months.

Compare to the income in Vietnam, the cost of a Lego set is significant so it's rare for kid to have access to multiple set. As a kid, I have a second hand, generic house building brick with doors and windows that now I can't find the serial number for. It's the only toy that I have consistently play with for over a decade. I'm just happy that we are giving this opportunities to more kid to have access to Lego.

1mi2909,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Wide-Veterinarian373/comments/1mi2909/i_live_with_white_carpeting_a_frazzled_guide_to/,I Live with White Carpeting: A Frazzled Guide to Carpet Cleaning,"Hi, my name is Regret. I installed wall-to-wall white carpet in my entire downstairs area two years ago (I live in florida in case that explains it, that’s just what the vibe down here’s like). I thought it would make the space look bright and serene. It *did*. For one week. Then my dog had a stomach bug, someone dropped red wine, and I learned what toddler yogurt projectile physics looked like. :D 

So obviously, I had to figure out how to clean that shit and maintain at least a nice cream color on the carpeting if I couldn’t get a pure dazzling white. 

Cue the research and now that I know what I know after a lot of trial and error and tiktok videos (wait has anyone seen that one of the lady who stained her white carpet a week before selling her house?) so now I’ll give all you lovely people all this info so you don’t have to spiral like I did

**Home Remedies:** 

Test out the cheaper stuff first, like I’m only including the ones that actually worked for me, got these off the net and tiktok and stuff. But they’re pretty basic so I trust my sources. 

# 1. Dawn Dish Soap + Hydrogen Peroxide

This is the MVP. Especially for organic stains (coffee, wine, pet puke, etc.). Mix 1 part blue Dawn with 2 parts hydrogen peroxide. Spray lightly, blot (don’t rub), then rinse with warm water. 

*Note:* This can bleach darker carpets. Spot test first. Also on white, go slow and don’t pour the whole thing over it or it’ll turn blue. 

# 2. White Vinegar + Warm Water + a Tiny Bit of Dish Soap

Safe for most carpet types. Works well on light odors, mild stains, and mysterious splotches. Less effective on protein-heavy things (blood, pet stuff). This is just for basic maintenance, like you can add the sol to your vacuum if it has the little slot for it. 

**3. Club Soda for Fresh Wine Stains**

Immediately pour club soda on the stain and blot like your life depends on it. Don't scrub. It works *if* you catch it early. (I’m a wino if it wasn’t fkn obvious)

# Things to Avoid:

* **OxiClean directly on carpets**: too harsh on wool blends.  
* **Too much water**: can soak into the pad = mold party (don’t even try it)  
* **Essential oils**: your carpet doesn’t need to smell like a spa, it needs to be clean. Oils can stain.  

Okay so obviously these work mostly on milder stains and all depend on the amount of elbow grease you put in, so for larger areas of carpet you do need one of those carpet cleaner machines. I am gonna leave a review here for some of the good ones, feel free to add onto it in the comments. 

Ok I see a lot of tables for reviews here, but i’m not very tech savvy, so just putting up simple pro con lists and I put all the products into like an Amazon list that I’m linking here in case anyone needs it: [https://www.amazon.com/shop/couturei\_official/list/3J0V9VKWFYW1W?ref\_=aip\_sf\_list\_spv\_s\_ofs\_mixed\_d](https://grassrouteguide.com/Best_Carpet_Cleaners)

# Shark Stain Striker 

# Pros:

* Super compact and easy to store
* Dual solution tanks = less refilling mid-clean
* Great for fresh stains, rugs, and upholstery
* Spray pressure is solid meaning it actually hits the stain

**Cons:**

* Not built for whole-room carpet cleaningYou need their cleaning solution for best results
* Hose is a little short if you’re reaching awkward spots  

**Bissell s Little Green (Pet Deluxe I think)**

**Pros:**

* Amazing for pet stains and smells
* Works well with enzyme cleaners
* Comes with pet tools that actually WORK (like the brush and the crevice one, sooo good)
* Feels durable, not plasticky

**Cons:**

* Small tank = lots of trips to the sink
* Still needs manual scrubbing in some cases
* Suction isn’t always great on thicker rugs  

**Hoover’s SmartWash Automatic**

**Pros:**

* Push to wash, pull to dry = very intuitive
* Covers big areas quickly
* Has a dry-only mode (surprisingly useful)
* Deep cleans better than expected

**Cons:**

* It’s heavy and a bit bulky
* Needs a pre-vacuum EVERY TIME
* Not great for tight corners or stairs (no crevice tool sadly)

Hope this helped someone out. Honestly, if you have an area rug only, then the home remedies should be enough or a tiny handheld vacuum but if its wall to wall, its better to have a machine on hand.

1mi27b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mi27b6/his_rejected_royal_mate/,His Rejected Royal Mate,"I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It took his grandfather’s centennial birthday for him to finally bring our son, Gale, and me home to the pack.

He swore the pack Elders had finally given us their blessing.

Our son, buzzing with excitement, bounced on the bed, clutching the champion’s medal from his junior fighting tournament.

He’d fought tooth and nail to win it, just to make his father proud.

But the moment we set foot on the Blackwood Manor grounds, we saw him.

Adrian, with his arms wrapped around a blonde she-wolf, kissing her deeply.

Adrian introduced her with a smile. ""My mate, Sophia""

Our son, Gale, rushed forward to confront him, stabbing a finger toward the seemingly perfect bite mark on my neck.

""That's the mark Dad gave Mom! You all see it!""

But the pack’s Head Elder stepped forward.

After a cursory glance, he let out a cold sneer.

""A clever trick of blood magic,"" he said with contempt. ""It can mimic a scent, but it lacks the soul-deep connection of a true mate bond. Any experienced wolf can see through it.""

I turned to Adrian, my body frozen stiff.

He turned away from me, gently stroking the real mark on Sophia's neck, which glowed with a silvery, moonlit light.

""The Blackwood pack will not accept a half-blood who can’t even shift"" he said. ""The only one fit to stand by my side is Sophia.""

I looked at him, and a bitter laugh escaped me.

To think I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood for a man like this.

Chapter 1

I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It wasn't until I walked in on him kissing his first love that I learned the mating mark he gave me was a fake.

I touched the back of my neck in disbelief.

""Eight years! You lied to me for eight whole years?!""

Everyone’s eyes were on me, but I could only see Adrian's expressionless face.

The face I had kissed countless times, the one I thought I would spend my life with.

""What is this, then?"" I ripped my collar open, revealing the delicate, crescent-shaped bite mark. ""What the hell is this?""

""Don't cause a scene, Elena,"" Adrian's voice was terrifyingly calm.

Causing a scene?

A disbelieving gasp escaped me, and I staggered back.

For eight years, I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood, turned down a career I dreamed of, and cut myself off from my friends, all because he kept insisting, ""The time isn't right.""

""I'm causing a scene?"" My voice trembled. ""You're the one who made a fool of me!""

I walked toward him, needing an explanation, needing him to say this was all a misunderstanding.

But Adrian pushed me away, his touch cold and dismissive.

Like he was shoving away a stranger, a nuisance.

""That's enough. It's time for you to go.""

That push was crueler than any words.

The whispers around us erupted into a storm of murmurs.

""Poor woman. Used as a replacement and didn't even know it.""

""Did she really think the Blackwood pack would want an outsider as their Luna?""

""Look at the kid. He's not a pureblood. Just a mutt.""

Every word was a knife, twisting in my heart.

""Adrian, please tell me this isn't real,"" my voice broke into a sob. ""We have Gale. We're a family!""

""A family?"" Sophia suddenly spoke, her voice sickeningly sweet. She glided in front of me, a victor's smile on her face. ""My dear Elena, haven't you figured it out yet?""

She stroked the true mark on her own neck, the one that glowed with silver light.

""That little trinket on your neck,"" she said, pointing at me with a perfectly manicured nail, ""cost Adrian a hundred thousand dollars. He bought it from some decrepit Blood-Sorceress.""

""It was forged in a full-moon ritual using Adrian's own blood. It doesn't just mimic a mark's scent; its true purpose was to cloud your senses and dull your instincts, trapping you in an illusion of love.""

One hundred thousand dollars.

He spent a hundred thousand dollars to weave the perfect lie.

""You've lived in that lie for eight years,"" Sophia's smile widened. ""The pack's entire inner circle knew the truth. You were the only fool kept in the dark.""

She lifted her chin smugly. ""See the difference? A real mark pulses with the heartbeat, glows softly when a mate is near. And yours? It's nothing more than a scar left by dead magic.""

My legs started to give out.

""No... that's impossible...""

""Mommy?"" Gale's timid voice cut through the noise. He was clutching his medal, his small face pale. ""Is what Dad said... true? Is the mark a fake?""

He walked cautiously toward Adrian, looking up at the Alpha he had called 'Dad' for eight years.

""Dad, tell me it's not true."" Gale’s eyes were filled with hope, the pure, innocent trust a child has for his father.

Adrian looked down at him, his eyes empty of any warmth.

""Let go."" He roughly shook off the small hand clutching his trousers.

Gale stumbled backward, his small body slamming hard into a cold stone pillar.

""Ah!"" The boy cried out in pain.

The medal clattered to the ground.

That medal was the proof of how amazing he was—proof he’d earned by training for three months, even competing with an injured arm, all so his 'dad' would see him shine.

Sophia sauntered over in her high heels.

She glanced down at the gold medal on the floor, and then, with a deliberate, cruel slowness, she brought her heel down and stomped on it.

A sharp crack echoed as the medal split in two.

""Little mutt,"" she sneered, ""you will never be worthy of the Blackwood pack.""

She ground the shattered medal under her heel, her eyes gleaming with malice. ""Just like your mother. Both of you, shameless fakes.""

""No!"" Gale cried, scrambling for it. ""That's mine!""

Seeing my son humiliated like this, something inside me snapped.

I lunged forward to protect him.

But before I could reach him, a cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

Chapter 2

""Elena.""

Victoria’s voice was like ice, each syllable laced with the authority of her rank.

Adrian’s mother, the former Luna of the Blackwood pack, stood elegantly behind me.

She walked toward the broken medal, her gaze filled with disgust.

""You shouldn't have brought this mutt to defile our sacred gathering.""

With a disdainful kick, she sent the broken medal flying toward a trash can in the corner of the garden. ""We don't welcome things of inferior blood here.""

""No!"" Gale let out a heart-wrenching scream.

He stumbled toward the trash can, his small hands digging frantically through the filth. ""That's mine… I trained for three months for that…""

His voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down his face.

I saw the bandage on his arm begin to soak with fresh blood.

For that medal, he had trained late into the night, refusing to stop even when he was hurt.

After every session, he would ask me, ""Mommy, will Dad be proud of me?""

And I always said, ""Of course, baby. Dad will see how amazing you are.""

""He is your grandson!"" I screamed at Victoria, my voice raw.

""I have no such embarrassing grandson,"" Victoria scoffed. ""A half-blood, worthy of the Blackwood name? Don't make me laugh.""

""Please…"" Gale cried, pulling the broken pieces from the trash. ""It's my most precious thing… Please don't throw it away…""

Seeing my eight-year-old son kneeling by the garbage, my heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest.

The royal blood I had suppressed for eight years began to boil, a powerful Alpha aura leaking from me, raw and uncontrolled.

""Gale, don't cry. Come to Mommy."" I tried to go to him, but Victoria blocked my path.

""Elena, control your whelp.""

""Poor little thing,"" Sophia cooed, walking up to me.

""Still daydreaming."" She suddenly gave me a hard shove.

I stumbled back, my spine slamming against the sharp edge of the stone steps.

A searing pain shot through me.

""Mommy!"" Seeing me hurt, Gale dropped the broken medal and ran toward me without a second thought. ""Mommy, are you okay?""

He was already weak from Adrian shoving him into the pillar.

He was running so fast now that his little face was flushed red.

""I'm okay, baby, I'm okay…"" I reached out for him.

But Gale's foot slipped.

Time seemed to stand still.

I saw his small body falling toward the stone steps, I saw the terror in his eyes, and I heard my own desperate scream.

""NO—""

A sickening CRACK echoed as his head slammed into the sharp corner of a step.

Blood gushed out instantly, staining the white stone red.

""Gale!"" I scrambled to him and pulled him into my arms.

My hands were immediately covered in warm blood.

""It's okay, baby, Mommy's here…"" But there was so much blood.

His little face was turning pale as paper.

""Adrian! Call the pack doctor!"" I screamed, my voice thick with tears.

Adrian just stood there, watching it all unfold with a detached expression.

""Stop the act, Elena.""

Act?

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

""Your son is bleeding!"" I shrieked hysterically.

""He's a werewolf. He has regenerative abilities. He's not going to die,"" Adrian’s voice was chillingly calm. ""Did you really think a stunt like this would win you any sympathy?""

Regenerative ability?

Gale had never shifted, never awakened his wolf.

He didn't have strong regenerative abilities!

I didn't have time to explain.

I tried to pick Gale up and run, but two pack warriors blocked my way.

""Get out of my way! He needs a doctor!""

""Ma'am, please calm down,"" one of them said, his face a blank mask. ""Don't disturb the ceremony.""

I looked back at Adrian.

He was kneeling in front of Sophia, gently fixing a strand of her hair that the wind had misplaced.

He was completely ignoring his dying son.

""Mommy…"" Gale's voice was a faint whisper.

He struggled to lift his small hand, still clutching the broken pieces of his medal.

Blood dripped from between his fingers, stark and horrifying in the moonlight.

He tried to open his eyes, looking at me with confusion and hurt.

""Mommy… I just wanted Dad… to see I was strong…""

With those words, his eyes fluttered shut, his small body going limp.

The small body in my arms was growing colder.

Chapter 3

I shoved the two warriors aside with all my strength.

""Get out of my way!"" Desperation gave me a power I never knew I had.

I scooped Gale up and ran for the main gate like a madwoman.

He felt lighter in my arms, his breathing growing fainter.

A horrifying trail of crimson marked my path on the ground.

""Hang on, baby. Mommy's taking you to a doctor.""

I reached the parking lot, fumbling to open the car door.

I jammed the key in the ignition and twisted.

Nothing.

""No, no, no…"" I twisted the key again and again.

The engine just made a choked, clicking sound before falling silent.

Someone had tampered with my car.

An image of Sophia’s triumphant face flashed in my mind.

""That bitch!"" I cursed, picking Gale up and running back.

I needed to borrow a car.

I needed to beg someone for help.

But as I reached the garden entrance, I saw a sight that shattered my heart.

Adrian was kneeling before Sophia, gently wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.

""It's okay, don't be scared,"" his voice was softer than I had ever heard it. ""That crazy woman won't bother you again.""

""Adrian, I'm begging you!"" I dropped to my knees in front of him.

Gale was unconscious in my arms, his face as white as a sheet. ""Save him! He's your blood! He's called you Dad for eight years!""

Tears blurred my vision, but I could clearly see that Adrian didn't even glance down at Gale.

""That's enough, Elena. Your act is pathetic.""

I was holding my dying son, sobbing my heart out on the ground.

He called it an act?

""He's dying!"" My voice shattered. ""He's only eight!""

""A child of my bloodline doesn't die so easily,"" Adrian said, standing up and dusting off his pants. ""I know you're jealous of me and Sophia, but you don't have to resort to such vicious lies.""

""Ma'am, I'll take you."" A young voice spoke up.

Adrian's Beta, Tyler, was suddenly beside me.

Without asking for permission, he gently took Gale from my arms.

""Quick! Get in the car!""

The car sped through the night.

I held my son tightly, feeling his life slipping away.

His body was getting colder, his breathing shallower.

""Faster, please, go faster!""

""I'm already at top speed,"" Tyler’s voice was tense. ""Hang on, we're almost there.""

But of all the terrible luck, we got into a car crash right in front of the emergency room.

""Luna, I'll handle the accident! You get Gale to a doctor! I promised the Alpha I'd take care of—""

""Doctor! Help!"" Gale was a dead weight in my arms.

I didn't hear the rest of what Tyler said.

I just grabbed my bloody son and ran inside.

The heavy doors swung shut.

The red light above the door lit up.

I collapsed onto a cold chair, my hands covered in my son's blood.

It was still warm, as if he had just been talking in my arms moments ago.

Suddenly, Adrian's voice echoed in my head through the mind link.

I took a deep breath and answered.

""Elena, where are you?"" His tone was rushed, as if he wanted to calm me down quickly. ""I know you're angry. I didn't expect my mother to do that. But trust me, this is just a temporary measure!""

""A temporary measure?"" my voice was a hoarse whisper.

""For the good of the pack, I need to mate with Sophia. But I swear to you, my heart is only with you. Once I've secured my position as Alpha…""

The good of the pack?

My son was fighting for his life, and he was talking about the pack?

""Your son is dying!""

""Enough! Stop threatening me with that. He has werewolf blood, his healing is strong enough. There's no way he's in any real danger!""

I heard a door open on his end.

Adrian, in his arrogance, hadn't even bothered to close the mind link.

""Darling, did that crazy woman give you any more trouble?"" Sophia's sweet voice dripped with venom.

""No, my love,"" Adrian’s voice was gentle.

""You're so clever, fooling her with that fake mark for so long,"" Sophia giggled. ""If I hadn't needed time to clean up my own mess in Europe, you wouldn't have been stuck playing house with her for so long.""

Playing house.

There it was again.

""Elena was just a substitute I found while you were away,"" Adrian's breathing grew heavy, as if he was lost in Sophia's kisses. ""Now that I've gotten what I needed from her, it's time to get rid of her.""

""What about the little wolf pup? Won't you feel guilty if he actually dies?"" Sophia's voice was closer now.

""Guilty about what?"" Adrian scoffed. ""He's just a mutt. He's not a threat. This is all just a game Elena is playing.""

Tears streamed down my face as I cut the link.

I couldn't listen anymore.

Eight years.

My entire eight-year union was an elaborate, carefully planned lie.

Everything I had given up for him meant nothing.

I was just a substitute, a plaything.

And my son, the boy who asked me every day, ""When is Daddy coming home?"" was nothing but a ""mutt"" to him.

The emergency room doors opened.

A doctor took off his mask and walked toward me, his eyes full of apology.

""I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. The child lost too much blood, and… he didn't have a werewolf's regenerative abilities…""

A primal howl of pure agony tore from my throat.

The next second, I threw myself onto Gale's cold, still body.

For eight long years, my Gale had lived like a rogue, never accepted by his father's pack.

I just wanted to hear him call me 'Mommy' one more time.

But now, he just lay there.

His sweet face was colorless, so quiet, as if he had never been in this world at all.

Fueled by overwhelming grief and rage, the ancient seal that had suppressed my power for eight years shattered into dust.

A primal and pure Alpha power erupted from me, so immense that every werewolf in the hospital felt it and dropped to their knees in terror.

I held Gale and cried all night.

When the sun rose, I shakily called my father to handle Gale's arrangements.

Then, I went home, clutching Gale's last belongings.

The broken medal I’d fished from the trash, and his favorite stuffed toy.

The moment I pushed open the door, the cloying, tangled scents of Adrian and Sophia hit me like a physical blow.

They dared…

On the night my son died, in our home, they were celebrating their victory.

Chapter 4

I stood in the doorway, my eyes fixed on Sophia’s coat hanging from the staircase banister.

Right where Gale used to love to slide down.

Footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Adrian descended the stairs gracefully, with a disheveled Sophia trailing behind him.

When they saw me, Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly.

""Elena, you're back."" His gaze swept over me. ""Your scent… it's different.""

He studied me, a flicker of confusion in his eyes before they iced over once more.

He straightened the cuffs of his shirt.

""Never mind. It doesn't matter. There's something I need to tell you.""

I clutched the bundle in my arms tighter.

""Tomorrow afternoon at two is my official mating ceremony with Sophia,"" Adrian announced calmly. ""The pack Elders will preside.""

""Mating ceremony?"" my voice was a rasp.

""That's right,"" Sophia said, linking her arm through Adrian's, her face glowing with triumph.

""We'll be formally bonded before the altar of the Moon Goddess. You're welcome to come. Though…""

Her eyes landed on the bundle in my arms with disgust.

""And what is that? Are you dragging that filth into my home now?""

I carefully placed the bundle on the coffee table.

""Gale is dead."" My voice was quiet, but it echoed in the silent living room.

Adrian paused his cuff-adjusting for a second, then continued.

""Elena, this act of yours is getting more and more pathetic.""

""Acting?"" I couldn't believe it. ""My son is dead!""

""Enough,"" Adrian said, his gaze cold. ""Are you still sticking to that lie? How could my bloodline not have regenerative abilities?!""

""He's really dead!"" I screamed. ""Head trauma! He bled out!""

""Then why are you here?"" Sophia sneered. ""If he were really dead, wouldn't you be busy burying him?""

She had a point.

If a child truly died, what mother would come home so quickly?

""Elena,"" Adrian shook his head. ""I can't believe your stubbornness. You've become a pathological liar.""

""It's not a lie!"" I lunged for the bundle, wanting to unwrap it and show them.

But Adrian grabbed my wrist.

""Elena, drop the act,"" his grip was like iron. ""I'm not changing my mind because of your threats.""

""Sophia will be my one and only Luna."" Every word was a dagger in my heart. ""Pack your things. Be out of here by tomorrow.""

""This is our home!""

""No, this is property of the Blackwood pack,"" Adrian corrected me. ""You were merely a temporary resident.""

Sophia smirked.

""Elena, don't be so tasteless. You've enjoyed a life that wasn't yours for eight years. You should be grateful.""

""I gave everything for this family!""

""Gave?"" Adrian scoffed. ""What did you give? You spent my money, lived in my house, and used my status to show off.""

""I suppressed who I am for you!""

""That was your choice.""

I looked at this man, the man I had loved for eight years.

The way he looked at me now, it was like he was looking at a crazy stranger.

""I told you, Gale is really dead,"" I tried one last time.

""Elena,"" Adrian's voice turned dangerous. ""If you repeat that vicious lie one more time, don't blame me for what happens next.""

""Slander?""

""Making up your child's death to get sympathy, what else would you call it?"" Sophia stood up. ""Adrian, don't waste any more time on this woman.""

I looked at the bundle on the table, which seemed to radiate a cold stillness.

No one believed me.

Even my son's death was just a performance in their eyes.

On the back of my neck, the fake mark, battered by the raw power of my unleashed royal blood, began to flake away like dead skin, revealing the pure, unblemished skin beneath.

""I'll go,"" I said, struggling to my feet. ""But you will regret this.""

""Regret what?"" Sophia laughed. ""Regret getting rid of a nuisance like you?""

I walked toward the door.

""Just you wait.""

————

Adrian's POV

The next afternoon.

The Blackwood pack's mating ceremony was held at the ancient altar of the Moon Goddess.

The Elder's voice boomed, reciting the sacred vows as every pack member watched the holy moment.

The statue of the Moon Goddess looked solemn in the candlelight.

""Adrian Blackwood, do you willingly accept Sophia as your mate…""

The ceremony was proceeding smoothly.

But Adrian couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Elena's behavior yesterday…

He had assumed she was just struggling to accept his relationship with Sophia and was acting out for his attention.

But today, she was nowhere to be seen.

He had planned to wait until this was over, until he had the full power of an Alpha, to go and explain everything to Elena.

The mark was fake, but his love for her, he told himself, had never been.

A wave of panic suddenly washed over him.

""Where is Tyler?"" He suddenly remembered telling Tyler to go help Elena last night, but he'd never heard back.

The mind link wasn't connecting.

He sent Tyler a text.

Go check on Elena and Gale. See what they're doing.

The ceremony continued.

""And now, the couple will exchange vows…""

Just then, Tyler burst into the ceremonial grounds.

He was pale, his forehead beaded with sweat.

""Alpha!"" he cried, rushing to Adrian, his voice trembling. ""Something's happened!""

Everyone stopped and stared.

""Gale… Gale is really dead!"" Tyler's voice was practically a shout. ""I just confirmed it with the hospital!""

I'm a 24-year-old German guy living in Tbilisi, and I'm looking to team up with 1-2 people who share a similar mindset to rent a nice villa together in the suburbs, like Tskneti, for about a year. The goal is to create a productive, healthy living environment where we can focus on personal growth, work, and enjoying nature without distractions.

**What I'm envisioning:**

* A spacious villa with multiple rooms, ideally something like this example: [https://www.myhome.ge/en/pr/21755176/6-room-private-house-for-rent-in-tskneti/](https://www.myhome.ge/en/pr/21755176/6-room-private-house-for-rent-in-tskneti/) (or similar options in quiet suburbs around Tbilisi).
* Shared rent would be around $800-1000 per person per month, depending on the place and how we split it (total budget for the villa would be scaled accordingly for 3 people).
* Long-term commitment: At least 1 year to make it stable and worthwhile.

**Key requirements for potential housemates:**

* **Self-employed or independent:** You should have your own work setup (remote, freelance, entrepreneur, etc.) so we can all maintain a focused routine.
* **No drugs:** Clean living is important to me – no recreational drugs at all. Nicotine and caffeine are totally fine, though.
* **Active and growth-oriented:** Sporty/active lifestyle (gym, hiking, etc.), and someone who enjoys self-improvement, reading, or learning new things.
* Similar mindset: People who value productivity, philosophy/psychology discussions, nature, and peace/quiet. No party animals – this is about a calm, supportive space.

**A bit about me:**  
I'm self-employed in marketing, CRM, and website development, and I'm planning to build my own SaaS company soon. I'm super into philosophy and psychology, love staying active with sports, and really appreciate the outdoors and tranquility that places like Tskneti offer. As a German expat, I'm easygoing, reliable, and looking for housemates who vibe on the same wavelength.

If this sounds like you and you're interested, drop a comment or DM me! Let's grab a coffee or meet up to chat and see if we click. Open to questions or ideas too.",1,1754376466.0,tbilisi,1,0.57,False

I'm a degenerate. No, I don’t type that with pride or to cover what I’ve done as right. I wrote this to send to the ones I love and care for. Sadly, they’ve all left me—and my actions—in the past. Anything I could try to say to any of them would be taken as an over-the-top story I came up with to win back any good graces I can. That’s my doing. I’ve played that hand one too many bluffs to be upset about that.

So I decided I would send it out this way, as an anonymous warning. If you read this and by the end you want the link to the site, please get help. I wish I did every minute now.

I had a long career of fucking myself over—from the tattoos I got as a teenager that cost me most summer jobs others would get, to the chain smoking that made it feel like a boulder was on my chest by my early twenties. But where I truly shined in ruining everything I had was gambling. From the moment I won on a gas station ticket on Christmas when I was twelve, I was in love. By February I had spent all the money I had saved up. So my mom told Dad he couldn’t get me any more tickets.

It took a week before I broke and sold my Xbox to a kid who became my best friend—mainly due to his older brother being willing to cash in my worthless paper for those sweet little scratch cards. They weren’t bad people, and I won’t pretend they didn’t tell me to stop. They all did.

I got a grip after that—a little bit. I found booze and pretty girls. Average teenage experiences, except most of my spare change went to the ticket man instead of dates. When I hit, I’d take out whoever I’d managed to stick around my cloud of toxicity that month. Sometimes I’d slip a twenty back into my mom’s purse. Maybe I just wanted to make up for the disappointment I caused them. At least I was giving them something useful.

It all turned bad when I got my license. Mom was so proud. “This will turn his life around. Some responsibility will make him take things a little more seriously.” That was the argument my dad used to calm her nerves as I went out for my first drive.

I drove to the first place you always do when you get a cheap-ass used car—the gas station, cause they sold it on empty. That was my first night using a slot machine. Sorry—“arcade” is the name they call them to get through some loopholes. That button might as well have injected me the way the high hit. I had saved a little under seventy dollars after talking the car down. Within forty minutes, I was up fifteen bucks on ten cent spins.

I tell myself all the time I wish I had wrung my pocket dry and walked away hating them. Deep down, I know even if it did, I would’ve been back to feed the machine again anyway. So I guess it doesn’t make a difference.

Now in my late twenties, those machines have taken everything. I found someone who could tolerate my degeneracy—well, she did until she found the credit card statements I had been hiding. I was down. For the last three years, I went down harder than ever. I lost a paycheck one night. The entire thing. It took almost an hour. I had chewed a patch raw on my palm while the machine rinsed my credits into the drain.

Now, you can't just use a credit card to draw out cash. So I did the next best thing: I went out and bought a thousand-dollar watch at the jewelry store and walked it into the pawn shop. A few more of those late-night shopping sprees and now you're three maxed credit cards deep that your wife thought you had canceled.

I don’t blame her. She didn’t deserve the lies I gave her to keep her around as long as I did. I don’t regret it. I’m a degenerate, and she made me feel good. In fact, I wish I had just hidden it all better. As selfish as it is, I’ve been selfish my whole life.

When she left, she made sure to tell my parents why. They told me not to contact them until I had gotten help. I’d been up all night since she left. I withdrew some money from my next check early—yay, payment apps. I just needed a good hit to give me a little feeling, so I logged in on my laptop.

You all know the place if you gamble online. If not, don’t look for it—trust me. I got my hit, and that little taste got me enough to play to an okay win. It wasn’t long before I was eight shots of whiskey deep and the whole $400 I pulled out early was gone.

I stared at that little zero number for too long. I broke at that point. Tears rolled down my face as I slammed my laptop up and down on the couch. I poured all my anger into words at the site—how much I hated it, how I gave my wife, all my money, and my entire life away to it. Howling in my despair, I heard the neighbor beating on the wall again. Not an odd occurrence, but it was enough for me to stifle my screams to a moaning whisper.

As I lay curled up trying to steady myself, the phone buzzed. I grabbed it, almost falling forward into the coffee table. Maybe it was her. Maybe she wanted to ""talk this out"" like she normally did when I had these benders. Of course, it wasn’t.

“You have a bonus waiting.” That was the subject of the email.

I clicked it, sitting back on the couch, confused—because I had already claimed my bonuses this week. No return address. It almost looked like when you save a draft in your emails. It had a link that looked like someone threw up the alphabet.

Now, a normal person sees this as a red flag scam. I saw it as fuel to keep my train running off the tracks.

Of course I clicked it.

It brought me to a standard login screen on a black background. Must’ve been one of the shady sites I signed up for during my benders. My usual login info didn’t work, so I went to look for a reset password link. None.

I closed the site and scoffed at my phone as if it cared. Back in my email, I reread the subject. “Bonus” was the only word I actually read before I clicked the link again.

This time it gave me a chance—and I took the bet again. I was in. No login. No sign in. Just a basic online casino—few card games, plinko. My eyes found my mistress as if she had called to me: slots.

I went to check my wallet balance and collect whatever bonus it had.

36,812,478 credits.

I remember silently mouthing, “What the fuck.” I must have hit a big win while I was drunk? The thought immediately shook off. No way I hit this big and didn’t remember.

The support chat popped up as I was racking my head trying to figure out if I’d ever been on this site before:

“Hello! Welcome to -------, we're so happy you've decided to play with us tonight. We updated your balance to your allowed credits. Please don't hesitate to reach out for assistance, and remember to play safely.”

I’d read this blanket statement too many times and could’ve almost quoted it without even seeing it. What threw me off was the fact it said they updated my balance already. How is it my first time here but they have a deposit into my account?

So I did what any degen would do—I thanked them.

“Thank you for the invite! My balance is really high. Is the balance my joining bonus?”

Ten seconds later, they replied:

“All users’ balances are automatically updated to a credit per minute as policy.”

I reread it. Then I did it again.

What did they mean per minute?

Maybe they didn’t speak English as their first language. It’s pretty common with these shady sites, I thought to myself. I went back to the main screen and scrolled down. The scroll wheel felt like a chain around my neck pulling me closer with each flick.

I couldn’t recognize a single one of the machines. Most of these places reuse at least a couple. They didn’t even have too many—about twenty or so. I found one called Nine Lives, had a little cat on it sitting on a tombstone. As the site loaded the machine, I lit a cigarette, ready to numb and degen all this money away.

The spin option was at sixty credits. I bumped it up to four hundred and set it to spin for 100 spins. I leaned back, watching the wheels of my beautiful love turn. A little win here and there, but nothing impressive. It took about forty spins before I hit a bonus: four cats dancing, little ghosts spewing out of their mouths as they fell into skin sacks.

One hundred credits a cat.

“This is fucking weird,” I thought as I watched the win screen. I lit another cigarette and spun a few more times—well, a lot more. I was down to 23,710,200.

As I ran my hands through my hair at the losses, I thought about how this is why they all left me—I couldn’t just pull out. It was a few minutes of reflecting on all the ones who tried to save me, before I noticed I was down six credits.

I hadn’t spun anything.

I opened up support.

My balance dropped another two credits as I typed:

“Hello. My balance is being lowered and I’m not playing any games.”

Instant reply:

“Yes. Your balance will automatically be updated to the nearest minute as policy.”

Again with the minute crap.

“So my balance will update every minute? What is the value of a single credit?”

Frantic now. Wondering how much I’d lost not playing here sooner.

“Each credit, as explained already, is worth one minute. Yes, your balance will update every minute.”

I sat and watched the balance slowly tick down, every minute, on the dot. For a moment I chuckled—every slot had a morbid theme: Nine Lives, Code Red ER, Crash and Burn.

I don’t know when it all clicked, but I re-opened support:

“How did I get all these minutes?”

They replied:

“Your credits are updated based on your total amount of minutes left.”

I took a drag of my smoke. This had to be a joke.

“Oh, so what happens when I run out of credits?”

“Your credits reach zero when all your allotted minutes left are gone.”

Now I was drunk and annoyed.

“So you’re telling me I’m going to die when I run out of minutes?”

“Yes. Please play responsibly.”

That was the last message I ever got from support.

I tried everything. I’ve messaged that stupid chat every threat, every plea. Nothing. Just like my messages to my loved ones: unanswered.

They weren’t lying.

Once I got under the 100,000-minute mark, I started to hurt. My lungs, my back. At 95,000, I could barely stand. I’ll spare you what the next 5,000 took from me. Just know they’ll need to burn this couch when they clean out this place.

I burned it all.

Now I’m at a cool 15,000 minutes.

Sounds like a lot—until you start calculating how many minutes are in a year. The first night took the most from me. I poured years down the drain drunk. I spent three days playing super safe, trying to win some back.

Now I’m here.

I don’t even have to refresh the page anymore. The number shrinks faster and faster every hour.

This is my chance to hopefully do something good with the life I chose.

A **manual coffee grinder** is a hand-operated device used to grind coffee beans to your desired consistency—coarse, medium, or fine—depending on your brewing method. Unlike electric grinders, manual grinders require no power source, making them a simple, portable, and quiet alternative for home brewers and coffee enthusiasts.

At *We Are Something’s Brewing*, we recommend manual coffee grinders to customers who value control, consistency, and a more hands-on coffee-making experience.

# Why Choose a Manual Coffee Grinder?

Manual grinders offer several advantages that make them a popular choice among coffee lovers:

* **Precision Control** – Adjust grind size easily for pour-over, French press, espresso, or AeroPress.
* **Portability** – Compact and lightweight, perfect for travel, camping, or small kitchens.
* **Quiet Operation** – No noisy motors, ideal for early mornings or shared spaces.
* **No Electricity Required** – Grind fresh coffee anywhere, anytime.
* **Durability** – Often built with stainless steel or ceramic burrs for long-term performance.

# How It Works

1. Fill the top chamber with your desired amount of coffee beans.
2. Set the grind size using the adjustable settings (varies by model).
3. Rotate the handle manually to grind the beans.
4. Collect the freshly ground coffee from the bottom chamber.

It’s a straightforward and satisfying process that gives you full control over the grind quality, which directly impacts the flavor and balance of your coffee.

1mi1vqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1mi1vqz/fasting_with_meditation_routine/,Fasting with Meditation Routine,"Hi Everyone. 

I am just coming up to my 72hrs of a fast and wanted to share with you the benefits of this sacred process.  There isn't enough information or experiences of fasting in any of the communities so for anyone wishing to do one or interested in it here is my experience. 

I chose to do it to release co dependency and to have a better meditation experience not to mention the detox and the physical benefits. 

I have had a huge shift. I made the decision to choose differently. 18 days free of caffeine and then the comfort food as survival which for me to break the pattern I kept getting the nudges from the Universe  to do the 72hr fast. This detox was not only of food but of TV which I had recently fallen back into as an escape from boredom - or the stillness to go within. Very little device time an hour or so a day and committed 30mins min in morning and afternoon/evening 30 mins. If I did more even better- which I did.  

My meditation experience has heightened. Although nothing mystical like I have heard others experience I  managed to settle the mind more without the distraction/static of food and other distractions.  I have a new perspective on meditating now- before it felt like a chore whereas now I enjoy it. 

The fast. I have been trying to do a ""sacred fast"" since February. I managed to do a couple of 72hrs prior but my mindset was  forced and rather it was as a punishment for over indulgence.  There was no surrender. It was anything but sacred. 

Finally something happened to me Saturday night where I realised I could no longer go on like this and knew I had to soften into this fast with a whole different mindset and show up for myself with meditation.  I have done and by surrendering completely and letting go - choosing Alignment over Comfort  and the Unknown over the familiar I was able to soften right into it. 

The first two days my hunger was no issue. It has been effortless  to be honest. I've had alot of practice leading up to this one. Lionsgate Energy has helped me through I am sure of it.  This morning I felt a little nauseated and hungry which I realise this was the ego clinging to this version I am trying to release.  A shower with a gratitude ritual released the hunger and its been a great day. 

For anyone wanting to do a fast you don't have to go straight in.  16hr and 8 hr window of eating is a good starting point.  Then work your way into a longer one. 

Here is a list I transcripted off an episode of Dr Mindy Pelz with Andre Duqum on Know Thyself. 
It explains the different fasts you can do and the benefits . 

Our Body is Intelligence. The fasting cleanses our Spirit and the body goes through and works its beautiful systems of repairing and healing. 

12hrs fasting the healing process begins Ketones kick in and you go from the Sugar burning metabolism to the fat burning. We have two metabolism systems

13 to 15 hours the Growth Hormones go up which slow down the bodys ageing process and also inflamation reduces . 

17 hours is  when the cell repair phase starts . Autophogy.  The intelligence of the  body starts to repair cells or discard the weaker cells or those that are cancerous or that have something not right. 

24hrs you get a full microbiome gut reset and a flush of stem cells. Old bacteria gets left behind and good bacteria gets spread out preparing for when nutrition comes in. 
 
36 hrs your bodys intelligence is working its way around trying to find nutrition so it goes to belly or liver and uses visceral fat and  eliminates that (visceral the one that can kill you) 

48 hours you get a full dopamine system reset.  Dopamine the molecule of more - but never feeling satisfied.  Gets reset.  

72 hrs The intelligence is like lets reset the Immune system and flushes with stem cells preparing the body for survival and the best form physiologically. 

72hrs  to 5 days your body is soaking in stem cells.  Injuries can heal . 


I am a few hours short of my 72 hrs and am feeling great.  Slight headache which when I meditated It went away . Just a bit of Himalayan Salt helps under the tongue also with the headache.  Im thinking of going to 4 5 or 6 days-(Lionsgate Portal)  

Coffee is a stimulant so affects the nervous system -even black - blocks serotonin and tea if sweetened and not Organic both can break the fast.  Just water.  

Just thought I would share my experience and leave this here for any souls looking for information on fasting. 

Here is the link of Dr Mindy Pelz. Even if you watch the first 20 mins she covers why she got into fasting (helped a lady who had months to live  turn it into 10 yrs by the fasting method and meditation) and also the details listed above

1mi1skt,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1mi1skt/cant_get_my_mind_off_my_ex_best_guy_friend/,Can’t get my mind off my ex best guy friend,"Been saying my current bf (25M) for over 2 years now and I love him so much. No complaints in that department. However, my ex best guy friend (25M) who I’ve known since freshman year of high school is still on my mind. Ex best guy friend and I have were always platonic, joked around most of our interactions, maintained the friendship throughout college even while I dated losers. He is actually best friends with my ex boyfriend of 4 years from high school and in high school ex best guy friend dated my best friend for like 10 years until sophomore year of college (just more background). All four of us were very close but our high school sweethearts, as we had very similar experiences, both broke up with us and that’s when ex best guy friend and I became closer. He’s hated this one guy in college that I was on and off with, very toxic relationship but yeah. Fast forward a few years, I start dating this guy which we were doing long distance however we still talked afterwards because we didn’t end on bad terms but I knew it wasn’t going to work out(hindsight 20/20 I should’ve just cut his ass off) anyways, a week or two after I broke up with long distance loser, ex best guy friend and I had gone out with my friends from college and crashed together on a makeshift bed…this was our first time ever sleeping in the same room together however I used to always crash on his couch in college and his versa when we’d visit each other. Again very platonic….until it wasn’t. We were drunk after the bars everyone was asleep in the house, we smoked weed and were just talking and laying next to each other, looking straight up at the ceiling. I could feel the tension like could’ve cut that shit with a knife. When I finally stopped talking and the room fell silent, ex best guy friend turned to me and grabbed my face and kissed me. Will not deny I do still think about that rush of a feeling that came over my body because I knew we shouldn’t have but we were. Things got heated and we had sex and like I was veryyyyy wet like top 3 on the wetness scale but like right after I felt the guilt and ick come over me almost instantly because I was just thinking about our friendship being changed because we made that decision. And it did change. He started asking me what I’d be doing and take me on dates that I didn’t know were dates for like 1.5 months after because we were on summer break from college. However he did tell me he wanted to try to be with me and I shit my pants because I didn’t feel the same in the way that I was thinking of what others would think of us and how our friendship will forever be changed. I was afraid of losing him like I have lost the other guys in my life I didn’t want us to ever go down that hole. So we slowly started fading. Not even 2 months after we stopped talking he got a gf which they dated for I wanna say 6 months or so (Given this is his first gf since his high school gf broke it off with him). He’s a great guy and I long for our relationship like I sincerely miss it so much and I think about it way more than I should. The guy I’m dating know reminds me of the relationship me and ex best guy friend had which I love so much BUTWHY DO I STILL THINK ABOUT EX BEST GUY FRIEND. I’m so happy I don’t deserve the love my current bf gives. I feel bad for breaking my ex best friends heart and I want to have more closure with him so much because randomly like I mean once every 6 months we will send random memes over insta that remind us of each other or know it will make each other laugh. But when I do that I wanna also say “I’m so sorry” or “I miss you hope you’re going great” but I feel like that windows closed. Also ex best guy friend doesn’t live near me anymore he lives in another state. So not like I can grab a cup of coffee and get that closure without receipts. I just had this guilt of letting that go I guess idk what to do to get my mind off of him….ALSO ex best guy friends whole family requested to follow me on insta like 2 months ago out of the blue which I found interested. AND ALSO ex best guy friend is also still best friends with my ex of 4 years from high school like THE NEXT WEEK after we had sex ex best guy friend was with my ex bf from high school and like recently in the past month  they went out of country together. Which I think is weird…like complete bro code violation. ALSO ex best guy friend requested to follow my mom on insta when he was out of country with my ex from high school WHICH IS ALSO WEIRD. Idk I’m just talking now. 

Should I reach out to him  and make a mends or like leave it and get over it. It’s been 3/4 years since our rendezvous. But how do I get over it is the question just my mind randomly wonders to him not romantically but just like damn miss the laughs.",0,1754375511.0,whatdoIdo,0,0.5,False

i have known a girl (chinese) who lives near me and last week my we met by coincidence in a club. shes a famous influncer in the city i live in (the city i am in is not international and the forigners here are very few) so after the club we went out and had dinner and then back home and tomorrow i took her to coffee and then dinner and the day after it we went grocciery shopping and shit and everything seemed nice and cute untile she stopped texting me often and last weekedn i found her in the same club with a bunch of guys which honestly felt a bit bad then those guys left her alone and she came to my table with my friends totally hammered and asked us to get her more drinks which we refused bcs we were already about to leave, she kept calling and texting a number saying its her female coworker but when i took at her screen i found ou that its the guy she was with and she was hammered and depressed bcs he left her alone since she refused to go back to his apartment with him, so she kept spamming him and calling him lol, which got me feeling like i was some kind of plan B.

i left back home after she refused to let me take her to her house, i never texted her after that. and now i am wondering did i do the right choice? if i date someone i become exclusive with them par default and try to not disrespact them like this especially on front of thier friends everyone was like damn we told you she aint good and they were pointing at her saying  my date is with another guy and stuff.

anyway after it i went on another date and this time that girl was actually decent and comunicated pretty good with me and told me how happy and intrested she was in me as well. at the end of the date she painted me a painting and said she will frame it and give it to me next date which was a good sign and we had our first kiss (we did know each other for a while) and then 2 days later she went ghost on me which left me honestly wondering maybe i am not loveable? or dating isnt for me? the girls i go out with are all a solid 7 to 8 and i would put myself in that category too, i am honestly lost because i just want to be with somoen i like and i honestly dont know what i am doing wrong to be given this type of treatment?",1,1754375384.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

If you're an [MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeep-bejugama-762714247) or undergraduate student juggling classes, internships, and projects, it's easy to fall behind on what's *actually happening* in the marketing world.

https://preview.redd.it/ma8spu5e95hf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=529bec264ac0c300f53b704a52e646affe78d0d6

But staying updated doesn’t need to feel overwhelming.

In this blog, I’ll share **simple, effective, and realistic strategies** that I personally use as a student to stay in the loop with marketing trends — without burning out.

🎯 Why Staying Updated Matters

Marketing is one of the most dynamic fields out there. From AI tools to consumer behavior shifts, everything changes *fast*.

If you don’t keep up:

* You sound outdated in interviews
* You miss out on tools that could make your life easier
* You lose your edge in class discussions or projects

But if you *do* stay updated:

* You’ll be 10x more confident
* You’ll impress recruiters with real-world knowledge
* You’ll grow faster in your career and network

✅ 7 Effective Ways to Stay Updated (Without Feeling Overwhelmed)

# 1. 📰 Subscribe to Bite-Sized Newsletters

Skip the long blogs. Go for quick, daily or weekly updates.

Here are some student-friendly newsletters:

* **Marketing Brew** – Simple and fun marketing news (5-min reads)
* **Neil Patel’s Newsletter** – SEO & digital marketing updates
* **LinkedIn’s “Marketing” Topic Feed** – Fresh content daily
* **Social Media Today** – Trends on Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.

🧠 Tip: Check one newsletter with your morning tea/coffee. 5 minutes = major career win.

# 2. 🎧 Listen to Podcasts While Walking or Commuting

Turn your travel time into learning time!

Top marketing podcasts:

* **Marketing School** (by Neil Patel & Eric Siu)
* **The GaryVee Audio Experience**
* **Call to Action (Unbounce)**

🎧 *20-minute episodes = your new daily class.*

# 3. 🧑‍💻 Follow Smart People on LinkedIn & YouTube

Instead of scrolling reels, scroll smart content.

People to follow:

* **Seth Godin**
* **Katelyn Bourgoin (Customer research + trends)**
* **Vaibhav Sisinty (Growth marketing)**
* **Ankur Warikoo (Career + digital insights)**

🔗 *Bonus: Follow marketing pages like HubSpot, Moz, and SEMrush on LinkedIn.*

# 4. 📚 Save & Skim Trending Case Studies

Don’t read everything. Just **skim the best parts**.

Go to:

* **HubSpot Blog**
* **Think with Google**
* **Harvard Business Review (Marketing section)**

🔍 Focus on:

* What was the problem?
* What was the strategy?
* What was the result?

Use these in your class presentations = instant upgrade.

# 5. 🧠 Learn One Tool Every Month

Marketing = tools + creativity.  
Knowing tools makes you 10x more valuable.

Start with:

* Canva (design)
* Google Analytics (website insights)
* ChatGPT (copywriting & brainstorming)
* Buffer or Hootsuite (social media scheduling)

⏱️ *Just 20 minutes a week to explore. That’s it.*

# 6. 📱 Set Up Alerts or Follow Hashtags

Use Google Alerts for keywords like “marketing trends 2025” or “digital marketing updates”.

https://preview.redd.it/bf0tgdn4a5hf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=50306ceb83b778bc905f6f8afa5b648c98a022de

On LinkedIn and Instagram, follow hashtags:

* \#MarketingStrategy
* \#DigitalMarketing
* \#MBALife
* \#MarketingTips

You’ll start seeing content passively while scrolling — no effort needed.

# 7. 💬 Join Student Communities or Online Forums

Join active WhatsApp, Discord, or Telegram groups related to marketing and MBA.

Also check:

* Reddit
* Growth Hackers Community
* LinkedIn groups for marketers

🙋‍♂️ Ask questions, join discussions, and share insights.

# ✍️ Bonus: My Personal Routine

As an MBA student, here’s my weekly update routine:

|Day|Action|
|:-|:-|
|Monday|Skim newsletter (Marketing Brew + Neil Patel)|
|Wednesday|Listen to a 20-min podcast episode|
|Friday|Follow up with LinkedIn posts from top creators|
|Sunday|Explore a marketing tool or write a LinkedIn post about what I learned|

🧠 This takes less than 30–40 minutes a week and keeps me ahead of 90% of my batch.

# 🎯 Final Thoughts

You don’t need to read 20 blogs a day or watch every webinar.  
Start small, be consistent, and choose the sources that *work for you*.

Being a student is already tough — but staying updated doesn’t have to be.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
