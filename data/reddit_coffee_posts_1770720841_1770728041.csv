1r0zwad,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r0zwad/thoughts_on_no_contact/,Thoughts on No Contact,"Am I weird for immediately going no contact? 

My (27f) gf left me (24f) on Friday night. We were together 2.5 years, living together in shared accommodation for a year and then we moved into our own place 7 months ago. 

She sat down on friday night, touched my leg, and said she’s leaving me because we’re incompatible. We had not had a single conversation, argument, or situation leading to this. I’d just cleaned her room ready for her to come home and relax because she told me she would be back late after having coffee with a friend (she, instead, was making plans to leave me with her family.) 

She wanted a long discussion. I asked her if a discussion would let us talk things through and fix things. She said no, so I told her to leave me alone and go back to her parents if nothing I said could do anything; I was shocked and devastated. 

I cried all night, packed up as much as I could, and my dad picked me up midday the next day. I miss her, and our life, but I immediately deleted all images and contacts of her other than her number for moving things out of the flat, blocked her on social media, and made piles in the kitchen of what was mine and what was hers. Half of the apartment is cleaned, I emptied the fridge and deep cleaned it, all of it was sorted. 

I’m moving back home with my parents before deciding what to do. I don’t want to move in alone immediately in fear of me becoming a hermit. But is this normal? That I immediately cut her off despite loving and missing her? ",1,1770727909.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1r0zvuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r0zvuo/aitah_for_sending_my_coworker_a_harsh_text_for/,AITAH for sending my coworker a harsh text for telling everyone my job search behind my back?,"I work in a small tech company, and there’s one coworker on my team, called Mike, whom I generally get along with at work.

A couple of weeks ago, I told him during a coffee break that I’d been exploring other job opportunities lately. Then a few days ago, a colleague in our team greeted me and said, “Hey, Mike told us you’re hunting for a new job. I’ll let you know if I’ve got leads.” That was how I found out Mike had been telling it to others behind my back.

Look, I get that he could genuinely mean to help. Our team’s small and close knit, and everyone’s been nice to me. Some colleagues have been here for a long time and know people in the industry, so he might’ve thought that they could help. But I haven’t even decided if I’m leaving yet; I was just testing the waters. Telling everyone like that made me feel awkward. It felt a bit undermining and I thought it made people question my commitment.

I sent him a message about it this morning. My words may have come across a little too strong. I am not sure if I overacted. AITAH for reacting this way?

At first, it sounded exciting… then I started looking into restaurant equipment and what it would actually take. Once you factor in fridges, prep tables, and basic kitchen stuff, the costs add up way faster than I expected.



Now I’m kind of torn between keeping things simple and taking the leap and expanding.

Firstly we have been unable to pull back to back shots so we can have a cup of coffee together in the morning. This seems to be a common problem but none of the solutions I've seen previously suggested seem to have worked.

I'll turn the machine on for 20-25 mins, grind beans (don't single dose), flush group head with single shot, then pull the shot by pressing down on the double cup button through the pre-infusion stage, and running until we get 36g of coffee.  This works okay for the first cup, but on the 2nd (repeating all steps in same order), can only get out 25g of coffee for the same 18g. Have tried discarding a couple grams of coffee from the 2nd cup grind, bribing the machine, swearing at it,  etc. Has been recently cleaned/descaled as well.

Chronic issues include REM behavioral disorder. 

We have seen several doctors local to us and have been told it’s a mystery as to what’s happening to my dad. 

I am reaching out to the collective to see if anyone has any ideas. 

Around October of 2023, my mom started noticing my dad doing odd things. My mom is a therapist who specializes in the geriatric population. He would put things in the wrong place

In early December 2023, my dad woke my mom up at 5am, he was speaking nonsensically, had gone around the house and collected random items and piled them up on a table. 

We went to the ER. He had an MRI and labs done. All came back normal. No sign of a TIA. Doctors said it was likely due to lack of sleep. 

From December through April, my dad could not be left alone. I had to wake him up, tell him to get dressed, tell him to eat and what to eat, and then he would sit and stare into space. 

There was one random day when he woke up almost manic at 6am. Said he had been living in a fog but now he was back. 

The next day, however, he woke up and tried to strangle his cat. 

In April of 2024, he could wake up on his own and handle daily tasks if my mom left him notes. He had to relearn how to make coffee. 

Since April of 2024, he’s had good days and bad days. There were a few instances early on that were really bad — he left the house and started walking to my mom’s work, mom found him outside of a neighbors house holding a bag of trash. 

His personality has changed - he is much more relaxed and easy going. 

He is able to drive himself to the gym (less than a mile from home), he plays racquet ball with a group of men he’s played with for years and works with  personal trainer. 

My mom can comment “your nails are getting long” and he will remember to trim them the next day. But if she asks what he ate for dinner 10 minutes after they finish, he can’t tell her. 

He has had two neuropsych evals which show mild cognitive impairment. EEG was normal. Normal gait, no tremors etc. 

Mom says that on his bad days, his voice is hoarse and he has watery eyes. 

We saw a neuro at the Cleveland clinic who suggested a neurodegenerative disease - my mom is adamant that it is not neurodegenerative.

# What We're Looking For

* A genuine interest in web design and building websites
* Strong motivation, curiosity, and willingness to learn
* Attention to detail and a commitment to quality work
* Ability to work independently in a remote environment
* Reliable communication and a proactive attitude
* Good command of English — our team communicates in Arabic, but learning resources, tools, and much of the content you'll create for websites are in English

**No specific degree or prior experience required.** Whether you're a student, a career switcher, or a self-taught enthusiast — if you're driven and ready to learn, this role is for you.

# Nice to Have

* Familiarity with any no-code/low-code tools (Webflow, Framer, etc.)
* A basic understanding of UI/UX design concepts
* Any portfolio, personal project, or creative work you're proud of

1r0zokw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_North-Persimmon2063/comments/1r0zokw/sobha_strada_sector_106_gurgaon_the_smart/,Sobha Strada Sector 106 Gurgaon: The Smart Investment,"# Sobha Strada Sector 106 Gurgaon: The Smart Investment

If you have been following the Gurgaon real estate market over the last two years, you have likely noticed a pattern. The prices for standard residential apartments have skyrocketed. A decent 3 BHK in a good sector on the Dwarka Expressway is now quoting prices that would have bought you a villa just five years ago.

For the average investor—or even the end-user looking for a small, manageable city base—this boom has created a problem. You want to buy into the ""New Gurgaon"" growth story, but you don't necessarily want to drop ₹5 Crore on a family apartment you might not even live in. You want an asset that is easier to manage, requires less maintenance, and ideally, generates a higher monthly return than a standard rental.

This is exactly the gap that [**Sobha Strada** in **Sector 106**](https://www.trueassetsconsultancy.com/property-details/sobha-strada-106) is filling.

It is not just another high-rise tower; it is a carefully curated mix of **Luxury Serviced Residences** and **High-Street Retail**. For those who find the current residential market too saturated or too expensive, Sobha Strada is arguably the most logical, ""smart money"" move you can make in 2026.

https://preview.redd.it/mymm2t71xnig1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8404b43f4fd13875fc153d488526b981e322aa17

# The ""Serviced Living"" Revolution: More Than Just a Studio

Let’s clarify what we are talking about here. When people hear ""1 BHK"" or ""Studio,"" they often think of cramped, budget apartments. **Sobha Strada** is the complete opposite of that.

These are **Serviced Residences**. Think of them as a hybrid between a luxury 5-star hotel suite and a private apartment.

* **The Lifestyle Upgrade:** Life here comes with a concierge, just like a hotel. You have access to housekeeping, laundry services, and a dedicated business lounge. It is designed for the ""Cosmopolite""—the frequent flyer, the corporate executive who splits time between cities, or the expat working in Cyber City who wants luxury without the hassle of managing a massive house.
* **The ""Hands-Free"" Asset:** For an investor, this is the ultimate convenience. You aren't chasing tenants to fix a leaky tap or repaint the walls. The management team handles the upkeep, ensuring the asset remains in pristine, ""showroom"" condition. This generally translates to higher rental yields because you are offering a premium, managed product rather than just a bare shell.

# The High-Street Advantage: Why Malls Are Out and Streets Are In

The bottom half of Sobha Strada is dedicated to **High-Street Retail**. If you have visited places like *Galleria Market* or *Horizon Plaza*, you know that the open-air, high-street model is winning over the closed, air-conditioned mall box. People prefer to walk, shop, and dine in open, visible spaces.

Investing in a retail shop here has a unique advantage: **The Captive Audience.**

Retail succeeds where there are people. Sobha Strada is not standing in isolation. It is part of a massive ecosystem that includes **Sobha City** (one of Gurgaon’s largest and most premium occupied townships) and the newly launched **Sobha Altus**.

You have thousands of high-net-worth families living literally next door. These are residents who need premium salons, gourmet grocery stores, coffee shops, and fine-dining restaurants. They aren't going to drive 30 minutes to Cyber Hub for every small need; they will come downstairs. As a shop owner, this built-in footfall is your safety net.

# Location, Location, Logistics

We can’t talk about Sector 106 without talking about the map. In the context of the Dwarka Expressway, Sector 106 is arguably the ""King's Patch.""

Why? Because it is the closest you can get to Delhi while still being in Gurgaon.

1. **The ""Zero KM"" Factor:** You are practically on the Delhi-Gurgaon border. This means you can drive into Dwarka or reach the IGI Airport in about 20 minutes. For a serviced apartment project, this airport connectivity is the single biggest value driver. It makes the project viable for airline staff, business travelers, and transit passengers.
2. **The Diplomatic Angle:** The upcoming **Diplomatic Enclave II** is situated very close to this sector. Once embassies and diplomatic missions start moving in, the demand for secure, high-quality, compact housing for diplomatic staff will explode. Sobha Strada is perfectly positioned to capture that specific, high-paying rental demographic.
3. **Yashobhoomi (IICC):** The massive convention center in Dwarka is a short drive away. This will drive a constant stream of international visitors to the area, further boosting the demand for serviced accommodation.

# The ""Sobha Quality"" Moat

In a market full of flashy brochures and delayed promises, the name **Sobha** carries a weight that few other developers can match.

Sobha is unique because they are ""Backward Integrated."" They don't just hire a contractor to build their towers; they make everything in-house. They manufacture their own concrete blocks, their own window frames, and even their own mattresses.

Why does this matter to you as an investor? Because it affects the **Resale Value**. A Sobha building looks new even after 10 years. The plaster doesn't peel, and the basements don't leak. When you decide to sell your property a decade from now, this build quality is what will allow you to command a premium price over neighboring projects that might have started showing their age.

# The Verdict: Who Is This For?

**Sobha Strada Sector 106 Gurgaon** is not for everyone.

* If you are a large family looking for a backyard and three bedrooms, you should look at Sobha City or Altus instead.
* But, if you are an **investor** looking to diversify your portfolio with a high-yield asset that doesn't cost ₹10 Crores, this is it.
* If you are a **professional** looking for a bachelor pad that reflects your success—a place where you can host a client meeting in the lounge and then swim in an infinity pool overlooking the expressway—this is your home.

It is a tactical, smart buy in a market that is otherwise becoming unaffordable. You get the location, the brand, and the future-proof concept of serviced living, all in one package.

I took a 6-month break due to a job switch, but I resumed preparing for the CISSP 6 months ago, dedicating my entire 3 days week off to studying. I began with a course from LinkedIn Learning by Mike Chappal and attempted a few quizzes. It's useful for foundation but I felt it lacked depth, so I switched to the Official Study Guide (OSG).

Additionally, I enrolled in the Thor Pedersen Udemy course and watched Prabh Nair’s coffee shot videos. 

I also subscribed to Learnzapp, PacketPrep, and Quantum Exams for further practice. I attended 2000 quizzes in Learzapp (78% readiness), 1000 quizzes in Packet Prep (76%) readiness), I attempted 3 tests in Quantum Exams 46% (Non CAT), 55% (627/100) and 62% (968/100). 

The Desc Cert Concise guide is only poor investment among all. The destination certification quizzes were also not much useful. 

My primary resources for preparation have been:

OSG – 9/10

AudioCert YouTube Channel – 9/10

Learnzapp – 8/10

PacketPrep – 8/10

Quantum Exams (CAT) – 10/10

On the other hand, these resources were less helpful for me:

Desc Cert Consise Guide – 2/10

Desc Cert App – 4/10

The first 15 questions in the exam were easy, but the actual test became challenging thereafter and remained tough through to the 100th question. The questions were much more difficult than any of the practice tests I had taken. Only those with deep knowledge could confidently answer some of them. 

While approaching half way, I honestly thought I might need to retake it in 3 months, with the peace of mind protection I had purchased. When I clicked next on 100th questions, the exam stopped and asked for a survey.

We’re two brothers building Brainbits. It's a personal experiment that turned into something we couldn’t stop thinking about.

It started with Aneesh trying to remember his coffee recipes, and me just trying to remember where I left my bike keys. 

Later down the line, we realised that our notes app was full of scattered bits and pieces of ideas. Manually sorting through them was too time consuming, and honestly, mind numbing.  
  
That's why we built Brainbits. It's a personal memory store that auto-organizes your notes as you save them. For example, I create a page called 'Marketing Ideas for Brainbits', and whenever I speak/type a new idea, the app recognizes it and adds it to that page. 

Makes it a whole lot easier to stay organized, especially when your brain's working overtime.

We've got \~200 users, and $12 MRR (it's a start!) Just wanted to get this out there :)

Thanks for being here,

Are you fascinated by web design but don't come from a traditional coding background? Are you the kind of person who learns by doing, thrives on creative challenges, and gets excited about turning ideas into real, live websites? Are you looking for a hands-on opportunity where your motivation matters more than your degree?

If that sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you.

**Wamda Technologies** is a remote-first team that builds cutting-edge software solutions. We're powered by dedicated engineers and designers who team up to deliver outstanding outcomes for our clients — and we're looking for our next team member to start as an intern.

# The Role

As a **No-Code Web Developer Intern**, you'll learn to design and build professional, production-ready websites using [Webstudio](https://webstudio.is/) — a modern no-code web development platform. You'll start with a focused learning sprint covering the platform, content strategy, and web design principles, then move on to building real websites for actual clients.

* Take ownership of real client projects alongside our team

# What We're Looking For

* A genuine interest in web design and building websites
* Strong motivation, curiosity, and willingness to learn
* Attention to detail and a commitment to quality work
* Ability to work independently in a remote environment
* Reliable communication and a proactive attitude
* Good command of English — our team communicates in Arabic, but learning resources, tools, and much of the content you'll create for websites are in English

**No specific degree or prior experience required.** Whether you're a student, a career switcher, or a self-taught enthusiast — if you're driven and ready to learn, this role is for you.

# Nice to Have

* Familiarity with any no-code/low-code tools (Webflow, Framer, etc.)
* A basic understanding of UI/UX design concepts
* Any portfolio, personal project, or creative work you're proud of

# The Details

* **Duration:** 3 months
* **Location:** Fully remote
* **Type:** Paid internship
* **Full-Time Potential:** Strong performers will be considered for a full-time remote role after the internship

**This internship is only available to candidates residing in Egypt.**

# How to Apply

Send an email to [**careers@wamdatech.com**](mailto:careers@wamdatech.com) with the subject line: **""No-Code Web Developer Intern — \[Your Name\]""**

Let's be honest – Calendly, [Cal.com](http://Cal.com), and most scheduling tools look like they were designed in 2015. Generic blue buttons, boring layouts, zero personality.

So I built [Tymeslot](https://tymeslot.app) – a scheduling platform that's actually beautiful.

What makes it different:

 \- Customizable booking pages – themes, custom colors, gradients, images, even video backgrounds

 \- Design that matches your brand – not some corporate blue template everyone recognizes

 \- Privacy-first – no tracking pixels harvesting your clients' data

 \- Self-hostable or use the managed cloud version

It does everything you'd expect (calendar sync, video room generation, timezone handling, email notifications), but your clients actually get a booking experience that feels premium.

Free tier available, Pro is €5/month. Takes 5 minutes to set up.

Your booking page is often the first impression. Make it count.

Sometimes I sit outside with a coffee for a few minutes before going inside, just to mentally disconnect from work.

A while ago, something serious happened in our neighborhood. One of our neighbors, who is a jeweller, reported that an expensive diamond set along with some cash went missing from their house. The situation caused a lot of stress for the entire family, and the police eventually got involved. From what I know, they haven’t been able to figure out what really happened.

What’s been bothering me is something I noticed the same night this issue came to light. Around 1 a.m., I saw the neighbor’s son outside with one of his friends. I watched him come out of the house carrying a bag, hand it over to his friend, and then quietly go back inside. At the time, I told myself not to assume anything. I didn’t want to judge or jump to conclusions.

But ever since then, I can’t get that moment out of my head. Every time I see that family looking exhausted and worried, I feel uncomfortable. I keep wondering if what I saw was important or if I’m just connecting dots that don’t belong together. I don’t have proof just a memory that refuses to leave me alone.

I haven’t told anyone about this. I’m not trying to accuse anyone or create problems. I just needed to get this off my chest because it’s been weighing on me more than I expected.",3,1770726864.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False
1r0zir6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1r0zir6/how_to_know_youre_ready_for_marriage_what_1000/,How to KNOW You're Ready for Marriage: What 1000+ Couples Taught Me (Science-Based),"I spent months obsessively consuming every resource I could find on relationships, marriage, and commitment. podcasts, books, research papers, youtube deep dives. My friends were dropping like flies into engagements and I kept thinking ""how tf do they KNOW?"" Turns out most don't. They're just hoping for the best and crossing their fingers.

After digesting insights from relationship researchers, therapists, and real couples who've made it work, I realized readiness isn't about hitting some arbitrary checklist or age milestone. It's way more nuanced than that. And honestly, a lot of people rush in for completely wrong reasons, societal pressure, biological clock panic, fear of being alone, because their friends are doing it.

Here's what actually matters based on evidence and expert consensus.

**You've seen each other during actual stress.** Not just ""my coffee order was wrong"" stress. Real shit. Job loss, family crisis, health scares, major disappointment. Psychologist John Gottman's research on thousands of couples shows that how you handle conflict is the strongest predictor of marital success. If you haven't weathered genuine storms together, you're basically test driving a car in perfect weather and assuming it'll handle a blizzard just fine. Marriage researcher Dr. Terri Orbuch found that couples who faced adversity before marriage and worked through it constructively had significantly higher satisfaction rates. You need to know if your partner becomes supportive or disappears when things get hard, if they communicate or shut down, if they blame or problem solve.

**Your relationship enhances your life instead of consuming it.** This one's subtle but crucial. When you're ready for marriage, your relationship feels like a solid foundation that supports your individual growth, not quicksand that swallows your identity. Esther Perel talks about this beautifully in her work on modern relationships. You should maintain friendships, hobbies, career ambitions. If you've lost yourself trying to keep the relationship afloat or constantly walking on eggshells, that's not readiness, that's codependency wearing a wedding dress. Ready couples have interdependence, not dependence. You want to marry them, you don't need to marry them to feel whole.

**You've had the uncomfortable conversations.** Money, kids, religion, where to live, career priorities, extended family dynamics, sexual expectations. If you're avoiding these topics because you're scared of discovering incompatibility, congrats, you've discovered you're not ready. Clinical psychologist Dr. Alexandra Solomon emphasizes that relational self awareness is everything. Most divorces aren't caused by discovering deal breakers, they're caused by avoiding discussing them until resentment builds to nuclear levels. The Gottman Institute's research shows that 69% of relationship problems are perpetual and unsolvable, they stem from fundamental personality differences. The question isn't whether you have these differences but whether you can discuss them respectfully and find workable compromises. Can you talk about the hard stuff without it turning into a three day silent treatment? That's the real test.

**You know their flaws and accept them.** Not in a martyrish ""I guess I'll tolerate this forever"" way, but genuine acceptance. Everyone has that moment when infatuation chemicals wear off and you see your partner clearly, morning breath, annoying habits, emotional baggage and all. Relationship expert Matthew Hussey points out that readiness means you've moved past the fantasy version of who you want them to be and embraced the reality of who they are. You're not mentally running a renovation project on them. Because here's the thing, if you're marrying someone hoping they'll change, you're actually just setting yourself up for disappointment and setting them up for failure. 

Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller is insanely good at explaining how our attachment styles shape relationships and why accepting fundamental personality traits matters more than we think. It breaks down why some people are anxious in relationships, others avoidant, and how secure attachment looks. This book will make you question everything you think you know about compatibility.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into relationship psychology without the time commitment of reading everything, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from relationship research, therapy frameworks, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can ask it to build you a learning plan around something specific like ""understanding my anxious attachment in relationships"" or ""building conflict resolution skills as an avoidant partner,"" and it generates a structured plan with podcasts ranging from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It sources from books like Attached, Gottman's research, Esther Perel's work, and other relationship science. You can customize the voice (I went with the sarcastic style because learning about my relationship baggage shouldn't feel like a therapy session), and pause to ask questions if something doesn't click. It's been helpful for connecting concepts from different sources, like how attachment theory relates to conflict patterns.

**You're not running from something or chasing a timeline.** This is the one nobody wants to admit. Some people propose because they're terrified of starting over, they've already invested five years. Some do it because they're 32 and Instagram makes them feel behind. Some do it to fix a struggling relationship, spoiler alert, marriage intensifies existing problems. Relationship therapist Lori Gottlieb wrote Marry Him which, despite its controversial title, offers brutal honesty about settling versus being realistic about expectations. She challenges readers to examine whether they're holding out for perfection or genuinely incompatible with their partner. Ready people are moving toward something beautiful, not running from loneliness or societal judgment.

**Your gut isn't screaming warnings.** I know this sounds woo woo but hear me out. Your intuition picks up on patterns your conscious brain ignores or rationalizes away. If you have persistent doubts that aren't just normal fear of commitment but actual red flags your mind keeps surfacing, listen to that. Cold feet is normal. A voice repeatedly saying ""this person doesn't respect me"" or ""I feel small around them"" isn't cold feet, that's your subconscious trying to save you. Clinical research shows our bodies often recognize danger before our minds accept it. If you're constantly anxious, if you need three glasses of wine to feel comfortable around their family, if you're already fantasizing about divorce, pump the brakes.

**You've built conflict resolution skills together.** Fighting happens. Ready couples don't fight less, they fight better. They've developed their own repair mechanisms. Maybe it's a phrase like ""I need a reset"" that signals timeout without storming off. Maybe it's a rule about no phones during serious talks. The specifics don't matter, what matters is you've created a system together. Hold Me Tight by Dr. Sue Johnson explores emotionally focused therapy and how couples can break negative cycles. It's based on decades of clinical research and the idea that beneath most arguments is a cry for emotional connection. Understanding this reframes conflict entirely. When you're ready, arguments don't feel existential, they feel solvable.

**You share compatible life visions.** Not identical, compatible. One person wants four kids and a farm, the other wants child free city living? That's not a quirky difference, that's a dealbreaker dressed in denial. But if one person imagines suburban life while the other pictures urban, and you can genuinely imagine compromising, that's workable. Dr. John Gottman found that successful couples create shared meaning together, they have rituals, traditions, and a shared sense of purpose. You should be able to articulate a future you're both genuinely excited about, not one where somebody's secretly hoping the other changes their mind.

Look, nobody feels 100% ready. Marriage is a giant leap no matter how prepared you are. But there's a difference between healthy nervousness about a major commitment and warning signs that you're forcing something. The couples who make it aren't luckier or more compatible, they're just more intentional about building something real before walking down that aisle. Don't let anyone pressure you into believing there's a perfect timeline. Your readiness is about the relationship's foundation, not your age or how long you've been together.",1,1770726843.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

It starts as a normal food, but as soon as the food are meant to be consumed, they come to life, their appearance are random and it's uncommon for 2 food to become the same animals.

There is a small bakery at the edge of the town that sells a very particularly delicious honey buns. Unfortunately this bakery is not that popular, usually there's only around 2-10 customer a day.

The owner get a fresh batch of honey bun, jumping happily and excitedly a bunny shaped honey bun came out of the tray, and so the others too. The owner are always happy seeing their creation comes to life, they cherish every single Foodles that they made. 

The Honey Bunny and other honey buns are now waiting on the tray hoping to be pick by someone and get eaten immediately, but... no one cames, not a single customer are coming. 

Hours go by and still not a single customer, what's wrong? Where's the customer? The Honey Bunny are wondering with full anxiety, it looks at the shop owner, they look... Sad, very very sad, the Honey Bunny then approach the owner to comfort them, they look better now.

Day goes down with not a single customer comes in, the owner is really sad now, they then packed the honey buns into a box, but the Honey Bunny refuse and climb on top of the table instead, the owner looks confused but they're not really care about it.

After closing, the owner gives the boxes full of honey buns to the homeless people near the bakery, including the Honey Bunny. The owner left and the Honey Bunny follow them, unfortunately the street is not a good place for a stray Foodles, wild rats, wild birds, even a hungry homeless person, but the Honey Bunny is not turning anytime soon.

Unfortunately the owner are too quick for a small Foodles like Honey Bunny, it lost the owner very quickly. Now, Honey Bunny didn't know what to do, should it go back? Should it just accept it fate and let itself to be eaten by a stray animals? The Honey Bunny is now slowly losing it spirit.

A tap on the back startled Honey Bunny, it's another Foodles, a dog shape cupcake, the Cuppycake signal Honey Bunny to follow it, where are they going? Honey Bunny that's already lost decided to follow Cuppycake.

Not long after they're arrived at what seems to be a Rat City, there's a big campfire in the middle, a bar..?, and also not just rat, but lots and lots of Foodles and bunch of other animals are also there, what is this place? What's going on? This place seems to be a shelter, a shelter for the unwanted Foodles and a home for stray and wild animals, it's warm, it's feels like home... It's home.

Turns out Foodles are sentient, they're not just wanting to be eaten, if left long enough, they could develop a much intelligence mind. But they still want to fulfill their duty to be eaten, it's their instinct to be eaten, but yeah, not all food are as lucky.

Don't waste your food.
Eat and respect your food.
Eating alone is not that fun, share with your friend, if you don't have, share with someone, they'll appreciate it.

But I have a really strong scent memory that I’d love to be able to tap into, and I think I’m finally ready to spend the money.

I’m looking for something that captures that very specific, nostalgic ""cheap hotel"" smell. A weirdly comforting, stark blend of industrial cleaning chemicals, chlorine from the pool down the hall, stale coffee from the lobby, ozone tinged rainfall from outside and laundered linen. It’s a beautiful smell for me that I’d like to smell like every day.

My other top choice is a pure, realistic outdoor swimming pool scent: that sharp, cheerful, chlorine-and-concrete smell.

I’ve done some basic research and I know Demeter gets recommended a lot for these atmospheric scents. I’m really curious about their Swimming Pool cologne. But I’m hesitant because I’ve read their scents are often cologne strength and don’t last very long. Since I’ve never done this before, the idea of having to reapply something constantly or use a ton per spray is a bit intimidating. I’d like something with a bit of staying power if it exists.

So… are there any ""cheap hotel"" inspired perfumes out there that actually last a decent amount of time on skin? For those who’ve tried Demeter's Swimming Pool, how is the longevity? Do you go through the bottle really fast? Is there a similar but longer-lasting alternative? Any general advice for a first-timer looking for these kind of unconventional, atmospheric scents?

This question may sound odd to you, however, i’m speaking, purely in metaphor, tone, textures, and how a voice feels, not literally how it tastes. for example, Derek Shulman from gentle giant has a voice that has always sounded to me like carbonated coffee, like a Coca-Cola meets a Starbucks Frappuccino, sharp, but effervescent, and very addictive. On the other hand, as I’ve mentioned in my very first post, Annie Haslam from Renaissance has a voice like buttered noodles, warm and velvety.

So I’m curious if anybody else hears progressive rock voices like this, or if certain progressive rock singers have a distinctive texture or flavor profile to you. Thank you for all of your replies to my previous two posts. And I can’t wait to hear what some of your responses are.",2,1770726357.0,progrockmusic,8,1.0,False

I moved into a short-term arrangement in Germany while the main tenant is abroad. The planned stay is a few months. We knew each other vaguely before (we had met briefly once). I responded to her online ad, and she recognized me.

**Key context:**

* I have a dog. She did not want to involve her landlord because she was worried the landlord might say no because of the dog. I did not insist on a formal setup. I would have been fine if she asked the landlord and the landlord rejected it.
* Because she was leaving soon and under time pressure, we did a quick viewing in the evening, and I agreed fast.
* We have an informal written agreement (her choice, because she did not want a “proper” sublet contract that involves the landlord). On paper it’s oddly worded: it says it’s not a sublet, does not mention rent, and says the end date is approximate. In practice, though, we agreed (in messages) on rent, a deposit, and a fixed end date.

After moving in, I realized the apartment is a very bad fit for me. To be clear: she did not hide anything and did not do anything wrong. This is on me for not insisting on seeing it in daylight, taking more time to decide, and agreeing in a rushed way.

The issue is personal fit, not a clear defect:

* The apartment is extremely maximalist: lots of belongings and furniture everywhere, not just “closets are full,” but visually crowded rooms. For me it feels stressful to be in, and it also seems to trap dust and smells.
* There is a strong persistent smell (not rot/garbage/leak, more like a heavy “old/cluttered apartment” smell).
* I am very sensitive to scents and get migraines from them. Since moving in I have been sleeping poorly and feeling very stressed. It affects my ability to concentrate, and I work from home so it is hard to escape it.
* I have tried airing constantly, cleaning what I can, fabric spray/air freshener, coffee grounds, my own bedding, and rearranging a bit. She said I can rearrange as I want and even put things in plastic bags. But because the place is so full and there is basically no storage space, there is only so much I can realistically change.

I told her I am struggling and would like to leave early. I offered to take responsibility for finding a replacement tenant, but she said it is very inconvenient because she is abroad, she was counting on me, and she does not feel comfortable giving the place to someone she has never met. I understand her side.

I understand that if this were a standard, proper contract, the default expectation for a short-term sublet would be to pay until the end. But because this is an informal setup (and that was her choice to avoid involving the landlord), I am trying to figure out what is fair in practice for both sides.

I feel bad because she has done nothing wrong, and I admit it was my mistake not to inspect better and think it through. At the same time, this place is really stressing me out, and I doubt I can get used to it. I also cannot afford paying rent here and somewhere else if I am not living here.

I am at a loss on how to handle this and would appreciate practical advice on what a fair here.",1,1770726290.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

It was there in the street. Not a remarkable sight. Not even noticeable unless you were looking for it. But he was looking for it. He had to as it started to segment it's way across the neighborhood. From the Johnsons little one story house to Noah's two story castle which wasn't saying it lightly. He had it set up like it was going to be invaded. Motion lights. Sturdy fencing. Beware of dog signs on each side of that fence alongside trespassers will be shot. Enough to make it seem like he was a paranoid recluse. Haverson didn't judge him. He understood. He knew what was out there in the world. At least he thought he did until it showed up in his childhood cul-de-sac. It reflected like a glimmer at first when he noticed it. He brushed it off because it was only a glimmer and nothing stood out. Until that second time when it happened again just days after that first sighting. He had been doing a brisk walk from the park close by to his cul-de-sac. Enjoying the fresh autumn air as he let it saturate his lungs. It had been dusk and the crescent moon starting to rise in the sky. He was whistling softly with his hands in his pockets. His concealed .380 police issued revolver in holster under his armpit. Haverson wasn't law enforcement. Just a concerned citizen. He started to turn the corner of the block, his eyes turning to look ahead and seeing that glimmer again. That same glimmer he saw days before. Only more detailed this time and bolder in color. It was scintillating and with a violet hue to it before disappearing in that instance.

He paused. Unsure of how to process what he just saw. His rational side wanted to explain it was a hallucination. His intuition overrided it with clear precision asking how a hallucination manifests through a clear head with no prior drug, alcohol, or cigarette use. Not even any prescription drugs and no family history of any mental illnesses. He moved a little closer as he felt something he couldn't quite describe at that moment. Some primal feeling. Something feral but not the cold coil of fear. Haverson came to the spot where he thought it had formed and disappeared. Not seeing anything and only feeling that feral emotion like a lingering sensation from the mere sight of whatever it was. Like it was something he wasn't suppose to have seen. He realized he was subconsciously tightening his hands into fists in his pockets before releasing them and looking around. Seeing nothing else he came back home to his own secure perimeter. That lingering sensation refusing to go away even as he laid in bed and drifted off into a world that wasn't recognizable even in his dreams. All he had were fragements of walking upside down through a forest and that scintillating purple hue flashing every so often in his vision as he walked.

When he woke up that morning he felt groggy. Not drained or sore. Just like he had been laying in bed with his eyes closed and only that. Not even sleeping as he sat up in bed. That feral feeling a lingering presence in the back of his skull as he looked at the world outside the window from his room to see the cul-de-sac bathed in sunlight. As soon as he stood he had a sudden feeling of something being off. He slowly looked around the room to see nothing. He didn't like this. This wasn't like him, to be cautious in his own house and in his own room. Something was starting in his heart like a cancer. He wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He connected the sighting and the dream but at that moment something was blocking him from realizing the full scene of what happened in that dream. Haverson walked barefoot to look at himself in the mirror to see that he was pale but no eye bags. As he looked at his visage in the mirror he noticed something with his eyes as he moved a little closer to it.

His cobalt blue eyes had been crystal clear. No bloodshots at all. He touched his face below the eyes to pull back the eyelid and saw nothing red at all. Just clear white. Something was off. That feral feeling grew a little more at that realization as he turned on the water in the faucet and turned it to cold and splashed his face with it until he felt clear headed and turned it off. He dried his face off with a towel and looked back in the mirror. His eyes still unusally clear.

Later that morning, as he sat in the silence of his kitchen at the table researching phenomena related to what he was happening, coming upon an article that caught his attention with the sight of someone in it have that pale and cleared eye look, he heard a soft giggle come from behind him. He turned around to see the scintillating purple hue flash brightly right before his eyes and he reacted like he had just been doused with acid as he yelled and covered his eyes as he fell over in his chair. His eyes burned not painfully but with a sickening sense of pleasure and that made his heart beat in revulsion from this foreign feeling. Haverson dared to uncover his eyes as he looked up at where it was and then at where it could be as he stood up with shaking limbs. He glanced around before turning and running to his kitchen drawer where the locked .45 kimber was. His fidgeting fingers misdialing every button until he found the right sequence and pulled the case loose as he gripped the cold metal and felt reality hit him like a grounding relief as he grabbed it and turned around with a pivot and looked desperately for anything and seeing nothing at all.

He cursed and had a strong feeling to get out of his house. He denied it. Barred it as he went to go check his security alarm and saw nothing tripped it. And at that sight, he knew it couldn't be trusted anymore. He knew what he saw and that feeling wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't imagination. It was real even as he glared at the system with that sickening pleasure still throbbing lightly in his eyes. And then finally he listened to his instinct of getting out and being in the fresh air as he locked the door behind him anyways and zipped up his coat to head to his car. His kimber .45 holstered under his armpit this time. He knew where he was going as he calmed himself. That feral lingering sensation having grown a little more as he noticed it in his chest this time instead of an unarmed emotion. It now had a home.

The stethoscope was strangely like an invasion of cold steel even though Haverson was clear headed now as the last of that sickening pleasure tinged off from his eyes in the waiting room. He looked ahead at one of the unnamed posters on the wall. Reading it and understanding it but not recognizing what it mean as he played that moment of the encounter in his head like something that hooked itself into his hippocampus and made the memory repeat itself again and again even as he looked from the poster to his provider Haley speaking to him in that quiet cadence he grew accustomed to. He shook his head softly as he looked into her chestnut brown eyes, meaning to say he didn't quiet catch that. But she knew already with a faint smile that appeared for a moment before saying in that quiet cadence like an sussuration from an ocean wave.

""Your heart sounds like a metronome, Hal,""

""You sure it's not a Allegro?"" He said with a certain edge to his course and gravel voice.

Haley picked up on that edge and quietly folded her hands together in a calm manner as she looked Hals hands gripping the edge of the procedure chair withe the white of knuckles showing. She also caught the difference in the postures they had and antipode had formed in her thoughts as she looked from his white knuckle grip to his eyes and didn't catch it immediately. Not at first until she was midway through ""What has you-,""

And then it registered as she saw how unusually clear his cobalt blue eyes were. As she paused and studied them with those few silent seconds she also noticed they were moistured over almost like they were glass. Hal squinted at her and started to ask what was wrong before remembering.

""You see it in my eyes too? How clear they are?""

Haley stood up without answer, not too quick or too slow but in a languid motion that told Haverson she was in her clinical detachment as she turned to the counter and pulled open the cabinet without word. She shut it and turned with a ophthalmoscope in hand as Haverson watched her walk towards him without word until she placed a hand on his shoulder in a grounding motion to let him know she was concerned in a manner that needed no panic. He nodded with acknowledgement before speaking and still not noticing that slight edge in his voice.

""Whatever it is started this morning. I don't think I even slept last night. Just closed my eyes and had some kind of fragmented dream,"" he dared to say because he felt comfortable in her presence and trusted her with confidentiality like this.

She knew his clean history but to cement that fact was his high functioning and ordered way of thinking. But for Haverson there was a hesitation that made him notice the edge, the guarded feeling of his hands gripping the procedure chair and his voice a little more rough than usual. That almost unnerved Haverson in a way that spooked him before feeling the leather under his fingers, sensing his heart beating calmly, and remembering that whatever this was had to be dealt with not in fear. He had a feeling deeper than intuition that the violet hue, that foreign and inexplicable thing would sense and manifest itself right in the room with them. And that feeling almost spooked him again at such an unnatural thought. He breathed as he closed his eyes and felt Haleys fingers tighten around his shoulder.

""Don't worry about the dream,"" she said in that cool cadence he had come to known,""Just tell me what happened when you woke up,""

He felt anger burn slowly but steadily like a fed fire at whatever that violet hue had done during his sleep. For what it had done during that encounter. And for this demeanor that he wasn't accustomed to that almost slipped out.

""I woke up,"" he said slowly and with control as he opened his eyes to her eyes softly holding his gaze with that clinical detachment,"" I felt groggy like I hadn't slept at all. I went to go check on myself in the mirror and saw how clear my eyes were. Washed my face with cold water to wake me up. It was still there,""

She studied his eyes with that clinical detachment and read the control he was presenting and knowing that he was unnerved. Haley knew from experience with other patients. And it wasn't prominent in Hal but it was noticeable and enough to make her feel something start to ravel itself around her chest in an almost barely noticeable embrace. Something with the most faint pulsating warmth. Before it disappeared as soon as it appeared and she stood upright and raised the ophthalmoscope to his retinal and saw that his right pupil didn't retract. She also noticed something about his iris. Something like a splinter of a bloodshot was what she would describe it later in private with her colleagues. Only that was what a lack of words at what she saw as she noticed five more strands in his iris. Extremely needle like and would have been undetectable except for a very faint violet hue to them.

She looked in left eye and saw the same aberrations. Carefully noting everything that she saw in his iris with detail that would stick with her as she stood up and did something that betrayed her clinical detachment.

She shrugged extremely uncharacteristically and with a manner that almost unnerved Haverson again as she turned her back to him for a moment that lasted too long for him. Her posture too relaxed. Too calm with her hands in her pockets. And for a moment he thought back to how his hands hand been balled into fists when he saw the violet hue a second time. He didn't like it at all and it made him sit up and ask bluntly.

""What the fuck was that?""

She didn't answer right away but she turned halfway. Her face blank like she had been shell shocked before that clinical detachment filled it within the very second he blinked. She turned to face him and took her hands out of her pockets as she clasped them together in a relaxed manner as she spoke in a manner that betrayed that detachment. Haverson didn't pick up on it at first. He had been to unnerved by that gesture she had done. That look she had before the detachment posture filled that look like a mask that didn't belong, didn't fit, wasn't suppose to have been there at all.

""I'm going to order a sleep study Hal,"" she said,"" I suspect what's wrong with your eyes had been caused from REM sleep that didn't fully saturate your brain in that period of when you had the fragmented dream. Do you have any concerns?""

He stared into her eyes and finally noticed it. He felt his heart start to quicken with an awareness that registered to him as survival as he said nothing. Trying to think. Trying to reason with what he was seeing as he tried to speak without the tongue for it.

Haley nodded. His silence as confirmation of no further concerns.

""I'll have you check in with me tomorrow. At 9am. The sooner you come in after tonight's sleep the better and whatever happens during that dream cycle will still be fresh in your memory,"" she said in that manner he still wasn't picking up on as she walked towards him and stopped before him within inches and said ,""I'm concerned Hal and I want you to know that I'm with you in this. Not at this moment but I will be later,""

""Sleep study,"" he just said flatly in that gravel voice.

""As soon as I can schedule it citizen,"" she started to place a hand on his shoulder before stopping midway and pausing, tilted her head slightly before nodding and letting her hand recede to her side before meeting his eyes and winking almost like a reflex.

She started to turn towards the door and walked with exaggerated sways that accentuated her hips and closed the door behind her.

Haverson felt like he had been taken into a world that didn't respond with reason. Didn't respond to the ways he knew anymore. He didn't know what to say or think or do in that moment before grabbing his faded white shirt and putting it on alongside his dark celadon wax cotton jacket and zipping it up in a manner too calm and detached before heading out of the patient room and down the halls by muscle memory more than sight before walking outside into the gray and clouded over world. The fresh breeze of autumn greeting and caressing his face in a way that ground him as he stood and breathed in that air. Let it ruminate in his lungs like a damn good swig of cold water. And when he walked to his Ford crown Victor and touched the handle, it hit him like a clear bullet to his forehead of realization of what that manner was. It was a jubilant euphoria.

And with that he got in his Ford and sat there trying to find a reason that vanished the moment he opened his eyes this morning. The fragmented dream playing out like a conduit into where he was now.

Part two. Purple Peaks

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night.

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun.

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now.

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow.

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob.

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer.

In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.

In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate.

In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.

In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table.

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe.

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage.

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue.

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration.

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1770726016.0,TheNightmareFactory,0,1.0,False

It was there in the street. Not a remarkable sight. Not even noticeable unless you were looking for it. But he was looking for it. He had to as it started to segment it's way across the neighborhood. From the Johnsons little one story house to Noah's two story castle which wasn't saying it lightly. He had it set up like it was going to be invaded. Motion lights. Sturdy fencing. Beware of dog signs on each side of that fence alongside trespassers will be shot. Enough to make it seem like he was a paranoid recluse. Haverson didn't judge him. He understood. He knew what was out there in the world. At least he thought he did until it showed up in his childhood cul-de-sac. It reflected like a glimmer at first when he noticed it. He brushed it off because it was only a glimmer and nothing stood out. Until that second time when it happened again just days after that first sighting. He had been doing a brisk walk from the park close by to his cul-de-sac. Enjoying the fresh autumn air as he let it saturate his lungs. It had been dusk and the crescent moon starting to rise in the sky. He was whistling softly with his hands in his pockets. His concealed .380 police issued revolver in holster under his armpit. Haverson wasn't law enforcement. Just a concerned citizen. He started to turn the corner of the block, his eyes turning to look ahead and seeing that glimmer again. That same glimmer he saw days before. Only more detailed this time and bolder in color. It was scintillating and with a violet hue to it before disappearing in that instance.

He paused. Unsure of how to process what he just saw. His rational side wanted to explain it was a hallucination. His intuition overrided it with clear precision asking how a hallucination manifests through a clear head with no prior drug, alcohol, or cigarette use. Not even any prescription drugs and no family history of any mental illnesses. He moved a little closer as he felt something he couldn't quite describe at that moment. Some primal feeling. Something feral but not the cold coil of fear. Haverson came to the spot where he thought it had formed and disappeared. Not seeing anything and only feeling that feral emotion like a lingering sensation from the mere sight of whatever it was. Like it was something he wasn't suppose to have seen. He realized he was subconsciously tightening his hands into fists in his pockets before releasing them and looking around. Seeing nothing else he came back home to his own secure perimeter. That lingering sensation refusing to go away even as he laid in bed and drifted off into a world that wasn't recognizable even in his dreams. All he had were fragements of walking upside down through a forest and that scintillating purple hue flashing every so often in his vision as he walked.

When he woke up that morning he felt groggy. Not drained or sore. Just like he had been laying in bed with his eyes closed and only that. Not even sleeping as he sat up in bed. That feral feeling a lingering presence in the back of his skull as he looked at the world outside the window from his room to see the cul-de-sac bathed in sunlight. As soon as he stood he had a sudden feeling of something being off. He slowly looked around the room to see nothing. He didn't like this. This wasn't like him, to be cautious in his own house and in his own room. Something was starting in his heart like a cancer. He wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He connected the sighting and the dream but at that moment something was blocking him from realizing the full scene of what happened in that dream. Haverson walked barefoot to look at himself in the mirror to see that he was pale but no eye bags. As he looked at his visage in the mirror he noticed something with his eyes as he moved a little closer to it.

His cobalt blue eyes had been crystal clear. No bloodshots at all. He touched his face below the eyes to pull back the eyelid and saw nothing red at all. Just clear white. Something was off. That feral feeling grew a little more at that realization as he turned on the water in the faucet and turned it to cold and splashed his face with it until he felt clear headed and turned it off. He dried his face off with a towel and looked back in the mirror. His eyes still unusally clear.

Later that morning, as he sat in the silence of his kitchen at the table researching phenomena related to what he was happening, coming upon an article that caught his attention with the sight of someone in it have that pale and cleared eye look, he heard a soft giggle come from behind him. He turned around to see the scintillating purple hue flash brightly right before his eyes and he reacted like he had just been doused with acid as he yelled and covered his eyes as he fell over in his chair. His eyes burned not painfully but with a sickening sense of pleasure and that made his heart beat in revulsion from this foreign feeling. Haverson dared to uncover his eyes as he looked up at where it was and then at where it could be as he stood up with shaking limbs. He glanced around before turning and running to his kitchen drawer where the locked .45 kimber was. His fidgeting fingers misdialing every button until he found the right sequence and pulled the case loose as he gripped the cold metal and felt reality hit him like a grounding relief as he grabbed it and turned around with a pivot and looked desperately for anything and seeing nothing at all.

He cursed and had a strong feeling to get out of his house. He denied it. Barred it as he went to go check his security alarm and saw nothing tripped it. And at that sight, he knew it couldn't be trusted anymore. He knew what he saw and that feeling wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't imagination. It was real even as he glared at the system with that sickening pleasure still throbbing lightly in his eyes. And then finally he listened to his instinct of getting out and being in the fresh air as he locked the door behind him anyways and zipped up his coat to head to his car. His kimber .45 holstered under his armpit this time. He knew where he was going as he calmed himself. That feral lingering sensation having grown a little more as he noticed it in his chest this time instead of an unarmed emotion. It now had a home.

The stethoscope was strangely like an invasion of cold steel even though Haverson was clear headed now as the last of that sickening pleasure tinged off from his eyes in the waiting room. He looked ahead at one of the unnamed posters on the wall. Reading it and understanding it but not recognizing what it mean as he played that moment of the encounter in his head like something that hooked itself into his hippocampus and made the memory repeat itself again and again even as he looked from the poster to his provider Haley speaking to him in that quiet cadence he grew accustomed to. He shook his head softly as he looked into her chestnut brown eyes, meaning to say he didn't quiet catch that. But she knew already with a faint smile that appeared for a moment before saying in that quiet cadence like an sussuration from an ocean wave.

""Your heart sounds like a metronome, Hal,""

""You sure it's not a Allegro?"" He said with a certain edge to his course and gravel voice.

Haley picked up on that edge and quietly folded her hands together in a calm manner as she looked Hals hands gripping the edge of the procedure chair withe the white of knuckles showing. She also caught the difference in the postures they had and antipode had formed in her thoughts as she looked from his white knuckle grip to his eyes and didn't catch it immediately. Not at first until she was midway through ""What has you-,""

And then it registered as she saw how unusually clear his cobalt blue eyes were. As she paused and studied them with those few silent seconds she also noticed they were moistured over almost like they were glass. Hal squinted at her and started to ask what was wrong before remembering.

""You see it in my eyes too? How clear they are?""

Haley stood up without answer, not too quick or too slow but in a languid motion that told Haverson she was in her clinical detachment as she turned to the counter and pulled open the cabinet without word. She shut it and turned with a ophthalmoscope in hand as Haverson watched her walk towards him without word until she placed a hand on his shoulder in a grounding motion to let him know she was concerned in a manner that needed no panic. He nodded with acknowledgement before speaking and still not noticing that slight edge in his voice.

""Whatever it is started this morning. I don't think I even slept last night. Just closed my eyes and had some kind of fragmented dream,"" he dared to say because he felt comfortable in her presence and trusted her with confidentiality like this.

She knew his clean history but to cement that fact was his high functioning and ordered way of thinking. But for Haverson there was a hesitation that made him notice the edge, the guarded feeling of his hands gripping the procedure chair and his voice a little more rough than usual. That almost unnerved Haverson in a way that spooked him before feeling the leather under his fingers, sensing his heart beating calmly, and remembering that whatever this was had to be dealt with not in fear. He had a feeling deeper than intuition that the violet hue, that foreign and inexplicable thing would sense and manifest itself right in the room with them. And that feeling almost spooked him again at such an unnatural thought. He breathed as he closed his eyes and felt Haleys fingers tighten around his shoulder.

""Don't worry about the dream,"" she said in that cool cadence he had come to known,""Just tell me what happened when you woke up,""

He felt anger burn slowly but steadily like a fed fire at whatever that violet hue had done during his sleep. For what it had done during that encounter. And for this demeanor that he wasn't accustomed to that almost slipped out.

""I woke up,"" he said slowly and with control as he opened his eyes to her eyes softly holding his gaze with that clinical detachment,"" I felt groggy like I hadn't slept at all. I went to go check on myself in the mirror and saw how clear my eyes were. Washed my face with cold water to wake me up. It was still there,""

She studied his eyes with that clinical detachment and read the control he was presenting and knowing that he was unnerved. Haley knew from experience with other patients. And it wasn't prominent in Hal but it was noticeable and enough to make her feel something start to ravel itself around her chest in an almost barely noticeable embrace. Something with the most faint pulsating warmth. Before it disappeared as soon as it appeared and she stood upright and raised the ophthalmoscope to his retinal and saw that his right pupil didn't retract. She also noticed something about his iris. Something like a splinter of a bloodshot was what she would describe it later in private with her colleagues. Only that was what a lack of words at what she saw as she noticed five more strands in his iris. Extremely needle like and would have been undetectable except for a very faint violet hue to them.

She looked in left eye and saw the same aberrations. Carefully noting everything that she saw in his iris with detail that would stick with her as she stood up and did something that betrayed her clinical detachment.

She shrugged extremely uncharacteristically and with a manner that almost unnerved Haverson again as she turned her back to him for a moment that lasted too long for him. Her posture too relaxed. Too calm with her hands in her pockets. And for a moment he thought back to how his hands hand been balled into fists when he saw the violet hue a second time. He didn't like it at all and it made him sit up and ask bluntly.

""What the fuck was that?""

She didn't answer right away but she turned halfway. Her face blank like she had been shell shocked before that clinical detachment filled it within the very second he blinked. She turned to face him and took her hands out of her pockets as she clasped them together in a relaxed manner as she spoke in a manner that betrayed that detachment. Haverson didn't pick up on it at first. He had been to unnerved by that gesture she had done. That look she had before the detachment posture filled that look like a mask that didn't belong, didn't fit, wasn't suppose to have been there at all.

""I'm going to order a sleep study Hal,"" she said,"" I suspect what's wrong with your eyes had been caused from REM sleep that didn't fully saturate your brain in that period of when you had the fragmented dream. Do you have any concerns?""

He stared into her eyes and finally noticed it. He felt his heart start to quicken with an awareness that registered to him as survival as he said nothing. Trying to think. Trying to reason with what he was seeing as he tried to speak without the tongue for it.

Haley nodded. His silence as confirmation of no further concerns.

""I'll have you check in with me tomorrow. At 9am. The sooner you come in after tonight's sleep the better and whatever happens during that dream cycle will still be fresh in your memory,"" she said in that manner he still wasn't picking up on as she walked towards him and stopped before him within inches and said ,""I'm concerned Hal and I want you to know that I'm with you in this. Not at this moment but I will be later,""

""Sleep study,"" he just said flatly in that gravel voice.

""As soon as I can schedule it citizen,"" she started to place a hand on his shoulder before stopping midway and pausing, tilted her head slightly before nodding and letting her hand recede to her side before meeting his eyes and winking almost like a reflex.

She started to turn towards the door and walked with exaggerated sways that accentuated her hips and closed the door behind her.

Haverson felt like he had been taken into a world that didn't respond with reason. Didn't respond to the ways he knew anymore. He didn't know what to say or think or do in that moment before grabbing his faded white shirt and putting it on alongside his dark celadon wax cotton jacket and zipping it up in a manner too calm and detached before heading out of the patient room and down the halls by muscle memory more than sight before walking outside into the gray and clouded over world. The fresh breeze of autumn greeting and caressing his face in a way that ground him as he stood and breathed in that air. Let it ruminate in his lungs like a damn good swig of cold water. And when he walked to his Ford crown Victor and touched the handle, it hit him like a clear bullet to his forehead of realization of what that manner was. It was a jubilant euphoria.

And with that he got in his Ford and sat there trying to find a reason that vanished the moment he opened his eyes this morning. The fragmented dream playing out like a conduit into where he was now.

Part two. Purple Peaks

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night.

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun.

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now.

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow.

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob.

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer.

In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.

In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate.

In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.

In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table.

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe.

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage.

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue.

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration.

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1770725940.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False

But one upgrade that's flying under the radar for many is the GoMining Card – a virtual Visa debit card that lets you spend your crypto balance in everyday life while supercharging your mining farm. It's a seamless bridge between your GoMining wallet and real-world spending. Here's why you should seriously consider getting one ASAP.

**Key Benefits of the GoMining Card**

1. **Spend Crypto Like Fiat** – Instantly & Everywhere Top up from your GoMining wallet with BTC, USDT, GOMINING (GMT), USDC, and other supported coins. At checkout, it auto-converts to EUR (or local fiat) with no manual swaps or exchange waits. Use it online, add to Apple Pay/Google Pay for contactless in-store payments – anywhere Visa is accepted. It's like turning your mining rewards into coffee, groceries, bills, or travel without selling on exchanges and paying fees.
2. **Free 1 TH Miner on Signup** \- When you open and activate the card (after Level 2 KYC via SumSub and meeting balance requirements), GoMining gifts you 1 TH of mining power for free. That's instant extra daily BTC rewards added to your chosen miner – no purchase needed. It's a nice kickstart or boost to your existing setup.
3. **Up to 5% Cashback in TH/s** – Grow Your Mining Automatically, **this is the killer feature**. Every purchase earns cashback in mining power, credited monthly to your selected miner. The rate ties to your VIP level – higher VIP (from holding/locking GMT, activity, etc.) means higher % (up to 5%). Your everyday spending literally mines more BTC for you passively. Spend on groceries? Get more hashpower. Pay rent? Bigger miner. It's compounding your mining farm with real-life use.
4. **Secure, Simple, & Integrated No separate apps** – everything lives in the GoMining app. Advanced security protects transactions, and it's virtual for instant online use (physical card rollout expected soon). No issuance fees, low or no hidden costs for many users, and it supports stablecoins so you avoid volatility when spending.
5. **Perfect Synergy with the Ecosystem** \- If you're already in Miner Wars, holding GMT for discounts, or providing liquidity, the card adds another layer: monetize rewards without exiting the platform. Turn BTC earnings into spending power while earning more TH to win bigger in Wars or scale your farm. It's the ""earn → spend → earn more"" loop that makes GoMining feel like a full Bitcoin lifestyle.

**Who Should Get It?**

* Anyone tired of manual crypto-to-fiat conversions and fees.
* Miners wanting passive TH growth tied to daily life (groceries, subscriptions, etc.).
* VIP climbers – card spending can help push your level for better rates and perks.

**Quick Setup Tips**  


* Head to the app > Wallet/Card section > Apply (complete KYC Level 2 if needed). 
* Fund your wallet, activate, pick your miner for cashback/1TH bonus, and add to your phone wallet. 
* Start small to test – I've seen community posts where folks are already stacking extra TH from routine spends, turning ""expenses"" into mining fuel. 

If you're in a supported region and haven't checked it out, you're leaving free hashpower and convenience on the table.

It was there in the street. Not a remarkable sight. Not even noticeable unless you were looking for it. But he was looking for it. He had to as it started to segment it's way across the neighborhood. From the Johnsons little one story house to Noah's two story castle which wasn't saying it lightly. He had it set up like it was going to be invaded. Motion lights. Sturdy fencing. Beware of dog signs on each side of that fence alongside trespassers will be shot. Enough to make it seem like he was a paranoid recluse. Haverson didn't judge him. He understood. He knew what was out there in the world. At least he thought he did until it showed up in his childhood cul-de-sac. It reflected like a glimmer at first when he noticed it. He brushed it off because it was only a glimmer and nothing stood out. Until that second time when it happened again just days after that first sighting. He had been doing a brisk walk from the park close by to his cul-de-sac. Enjoying the fresh autumn air as he let it saturate his lungs. It had been dusk and the crescent moon starting to rise in the sky. He was whistling softly with his hands in his pockets. His concealed .380 police issued revolver in holster under his armpit. Haverson wasn't law enforcement. Just a concerned citizen. He started to turn the corner of the block, his eyes turning to look ahead and seeing that glimmer again. That same glimmer he saw days before. Only more detailed this time and bolder in color. It was scintillating and with a violet hue to it before disappearing in that instance.

He paused. Unsure of how to process what he just saw. His rational side wanted to explain it was a hallucination. His intuition overrided it with clear precision asking how a hallucination manifests through a clear head with no prior drug, alcohol, or cigarette use. Not even any prescription drugs and no family history of any mental illnesses. He moved a little closer as he felt something he couldn't quite describe at that moment. Some primal feeling. Something feral but not the cold coil of fear. Haverson came to the spot where he thought it had formed and disappeared. Not seeing anything and only feeling that feral emotion like a lingering sensation from the mere sight of whatever it was. Like it was something he wasn't suppose to have seen. He realized he was subconsciously tightening his hands into fists in his pockets before releasing them and looking around. Seeing nothing else he came back home to his own secure perimeter. That lingering sensation refusing to go away even as he laid in bed and drifted off into a world that wasn't recognizable even in his dreams. All he had were fragements of walking upside down through a forest and that scintillating purple hue flashing every so often in his vision as he walked.

When he woke up that morning he felt groggy. Not drained or sore. Just like he had been laying in bed with his eyes closed and only that. Not even sleeping as he sat up in bed. That feral feeling a lingering presence in the back of his skull as he looked at the world outside the window from his room to see the cul-de-sac bathed in sunlight. As soon as he stood he had a sudden feeling of something being off. He slowly looked around the room to see nothing. He didn't like this. This wasn't like him, to be cautious in his own house and in his own room. Something was starting in his heart like a cancer. He wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He connected the sighting and the dream but at that moment something was blocking him from realizing the full scene of what happened in that dream. Haverson walked barefoot to look at himself in the mirror to see that he was pale but no eye bags. As he looked at his visage in the mirror he noticed something with his eyes as he moved a little closer to it.

His cobalt blue eyes had been crystal clear. No bloodshots at all. He touched his face below the eyes to pull back the eyelid and saw nothing red at all. Just clear white. Something was off. That feral feeling grew a little more at that realization as he turned on the water in the faucet and turned it to cold and splashed his face with it until he felt clear headed and turned it off. He dried his face off with a towel and looked back in the mirror. His eyes still unusally clear.

Later that morning, as he sat in the silence of his kitchen at the table researching phenomena related to what he was happening, coming upon an article that caught his attention with the sight of someone in it have that pale and cleared eye look, he heard a soft giggle come from behind him. He turned around to see the scintillating purple hue flash brightly right before his eyes and he reacted like he had just been doused with acid as he yelled and covered his eyes as he fell over in his chair. His eyes burned not painfully but with a sickening sense of pleasure and that made his heart beat in revulsion from this foreign feeling. Haverson dared to uncover his eyes as he looked up at where it was and then at where it could be as he stood up with shaking limbs. He glanced around before turning and running to his kitchen drawer where the locked .45 kimber was. His fidgeting fingers misdialing every button until he found the right sequence and pulled the case loose as he gripped the cold metal and felt reality hit him like a grounding relief as he grabbed it and turned around with a pivot and looked desperately for anything and seeing nothing at all.

He cursed and had a strong feeling to get out of his house. He denied it. Barred it as he went to go check his security alarm and saw nothing tripped it. And at that sight, he knew it couldn't be trusted anymore. He knew what he saw and that feeling wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't imagination. It was real even as he glared at the system with that sickening pleasure still throbbing lightly in his eyes. And then finally he listened to his instinct of getting out and being in the fresh air as he locked the door behind him anyways and zipped up his coat to head to his car. His kimber .45 holstered under his armpit this time. He knew where he was going as he calmed himself. That feral lingering sensation having grown a little more as he noticed it in his chest this time instead of an unarmed emotion. It now had a home.

The stethoscope was strangely like an invasion of cold steel even though Haverson was clear headed now as the last of that sickening pleasure tinged off from his eyes in the waiting room. He looked ahead at one of the unnamed posters on the wall. Reading it and understanding it but not recognizing what it mean as he played that moment of the encounter in his head like something that hooked itself into his hippocampus and made the memory repeat itself again and again even as he looked from the poster to his provider Haley speaking to him in that quiet cadence he grew accustomed to. He shook his head softly as he looked into her chestnut brown eyes, meaning to say he didn't quiet catch that. But she knew already with a faint smile that appeared for a moment before saying in that quiet cadence like an sussuration from an ocean wave.

""Your heart sounds like a metronome, Hal,""

""You sure it's not a Allegro?"" He said with a certain edge to his course and gravel voice.

Haley picked up on that edge and quietly folded her hands together in a calm manner as she looked Hals hands gripping the edge of the procedure chair withe the white of knuckles showing. She also caught the difference in the postures they had and antipode had formed in her thoughts as she looked from his white knuckle grip to his eyes and didn't catch it immediately. Not at first until she was midway through ""What has you-,""

And then it registered as she saw how unusually clear his cobalt blue eyes were. As she paused and studied them with those few silent seconds she also noticed they were moistured over almost like they were glass. Hal squinted at her and started to ask what was wrong before remembering.

""You see it in my eyes too? How clear they are?""

Haley stood up without answer, not too quick or too slow but in a languid motion that told Haverson she was in her clinical detachment as she turned to the counter and pulled open the cabinet without word. She shut it and turned with a ophthalmoscope in hand as Haverson watched her walk towards him without word until she placed a hand on his shoulder in a grounding motion to let him know she was concerned in a manner that needed no panic. He nodded with acknowledgement before speaking and still not noticing that slight edge in his voice.

""Whatever it is started this morning. I don't think I even slept last night. Just closed my eyes and had some kind of fragmented dream,"" he dared to say because he felt comfortable in her presence and trusted her with confidentiality like this.

She knew his clean history but to cement that fact was his high functioning and ordered way of thinking. But for Haverson there was a hesitation that made him notice the edge, the guarded feeling of his hands gripping the procedure chair and his voice a little more rough than usual. That almost unnerved Haverson in a way that spooked him before feeling the leather under his fingers, sensing his heart beating calmly, and remembering that whatever this was had to be dealt with not in fear. He had a feeling deeper than intuition that the violet hue, that foreign and inexplicable thing would sense and manifest itself right in the room with them. And that feeling almost spooked him again at such an unnatural thought. He breathed as he closed his eyes and felt Haleys fingers tighten around his shoulder.

""Don't worry about the dream,"" she said in that cool cadence he had come to known,""Just tell me what happened when you woke up,""

He felt anger burn slowly but steadily like a fed fire at whatever that violet hue had done during his sleep. For what it had done during that encounter. And for this demeanor that he wasn't accustomed to that almost slipped out.

""I woke up,"" he said slowly and with control as he opened his eyes to her eyes softly holding his gaze with that clinical detachment,"" I felt groggy like I hadn't slept at all. I went to go check on myself in the mirror and saw how clear my eyes were. Washed my face with cold water to wake me up. It was still there,""

She studied his eyes with that clinical detachment and read the control he was presenting and knowing that he was unnerved. Haley knew from experience with other patients. And it wasn't prominent in Hal but it was noticeable and enough to make her feel something start to ravel itself around her chest in an almost barely noticeable embrace. Something with the most faint pulsating warmth. Before it disappeared as soon as it appeared and she stood upright and raised the ophthalmoscope to his retinal and saw that his right pupil didn't retract. She also noticed something about his iris. Something like a splinter of a bloodshot was what she would describe it later in private with her colleagues. Only that was what a lack of words at what she saw as she noticed five more strands in his iris. Extremely needle like and would have been undetectable except for a very faint violet hue to them.

She looked in left eye and saw the same aberrations. Carefully noting everything that she saw in his iris with detail that would stick with her as she stood up and did something that betrayed her clinical detachment.

She shrugged extremely uncharacteristically and with a manner that almost unnerved Haverson again as she turned her back to him for a moment that lasted too long for him. Her posture too relaxed. Too calm with her hands in her pockets. And for a moment he thought back to how his hands hand been balled into fists when he saw the violet hue a second time. He didn't like it at all and it made him sit up and ask bluntly.

""What the fuck was that?""

She didn't answer right away but she turned halfway. Her face blank like she had been shell shocked before that clinical detachment filled it within the very second he blinked. She turned to face him and took her hands out of her pockets as she clasped them together in a relaxed manner as she spoke in a manner that betrayed that detachment. Haverson didn't pick up on it at first. He had been to unnerved by that gesture she had done. That look she had before the detachment posture filled that look like a mask that didn't belong, didn't fit, wasn't suppose to have been there at all.

""I'm going to order a sleep study Hal,"" she said,"" I suspect what's wrong with your eyes had been caused from REM sleep that didn't fully saturate your brain in that period of when you had the fragmented dream. Do you have any concerns?""

He stared into her eyes and finally noticed it. He felt his heart start to quicken with an awareness that registered to him as survival as he said nothing. Trying to think. Trying to reason with what he was seeing as he tried to speak without the tongue for it.

Haley nodded. His silence as confirmation of no further concerns.

""I'll have you check in with me tomorrow. At 9am. The sooner you come in after tonight's sleep the better and whatever happens during that dream cycle will still be fresh in your memory,"" she said in that manner he still wasn't picking up on as she walked towards him and stopped before him within inches and said ,""I'm concerned Hal and I want you to know that I'm with you in this. Not at this moment but I will be later,""

""Sleep study,"" he just said flatly in that gravel voice.

""As soon as I can schedule it citizen,"" she started to place a hand on his shoulder before stopping midway and pausing, tilted her head slightly before nodding and letting her hand recede to her side before meeting his eyes and winking almost like a reflex.

She started to turn towards the door and walked with exaggerated sways that accentuated her hips and closed the door behind her.

Haverson felt like he had been taken into a world that didn't respond with reason. Didn't respond to the ways he knew anymore. He didn't know what to say or think or do in that moment before grabbing his faded white shirt and putting it on alongside his dark celadon wax cotton jacket and zipping it up in a manner too calm and detached before heading out of the patient room and down the halls by muscle memory more than sight before walking outside into the gray and clouded over world. The fresh breeze of autumn greeting and caressing his face in a way that ground him as he stood and breathed in that air. Let it ruminate in his lungs like a damn good swig of cold water. And when he walked to his Ford crown Victor and touched the handle, it hit him like a clear bullet to his forehead of realization of what that manner was. It was a jubilant euphoria.

And with that he got in his Ford and sat there trying to find a reason that vanished the moment he opened his eyes this morning. The fragmented dream playing out like a conduit into where he was now.

Part two. Purple Peaks

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night.

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun.

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now.

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow.

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob.

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer.

In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.

In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate.

In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.

In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table.

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe.

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage.

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue.

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration.

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1770725857.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

It was there in the street. Not a remarkable sight. Not even noticeable unless you were looking for it. But he was looking for it. He had to as it started to segment it's way across the neighborhood. From the Johnsons little one story house to Noah's two story castle which wasn't saying it lightly. He had it set up like it was going to be invaded. Motion lights. Sturdy fencing. Beware of dog signs on each side of that fence alongside trespassers will be shot. Enough to make it seem like he was a paranoid recluse. Haverson didn't judge him. He understood. He knew what was out there in the world. At least he thought he did until it showed up in his childhood cul-de-sac. It reflected like a glimmer at first when he noticed it. He brushed it off because it was only a glimmer and nothing stood out. Until that second time when it happened again just days after that first sighting. He had been doing a brisk walk from the park close by to his cul-de-sac. Enjoying the fresh autumn air as he let it saturate his lungs. It had been dusk and the crescent moon starting to rise in the sky. He was whistling softly with his hands in his pockets. His concealed .380 police issued revolver in holster under his armpit. Haverson wasn't law enforcement. Just a concerned citizen. He started to turn the corner of the block, his eyes turning to look ahead and seeing that glimmer again. That same glimmer he saw days before. Only more detailed this time and bolder in color. It was scintillating and with a violet hue to it before disappearing in that instance.

He paused. Unsure of how to process what he just saw. His rational side wanted to explain it was a hallucination. His intuition overrided it with clear precision asking how a hallucination manifests through a clear head with no prior drug, alcohol, or cigarette use. Not even any prescription drugs and no family history of any mental illnesses. He moved a little closer as he felt something he couldn't quite describe at that moment. Some primal feeling. Something feral but not the cold coil of fear. Haverson came to the spot where he thought it had formed and disappeared. Not seeing anything and only feeling that feral emotion like a lingering sensation from the mere sight of whatever it was. Like it was something he wasn't suppose to have seen. He realized he was subconsciously tightening his hands into fists in his pockets before releasing them and looking around. Seeing nothing else he came back home to his own secure perimeter. That lingering sensation refusing to go away even as he laid in bed and drifted off into a world that wasn't recognizable even in his dreams. All he had were fragements of walking upside down through a forest and that scintillating purple hue flashing every so often in his vision as he walked.

When he woke up that morning he felt groggy. Not drained or sore. Just like he had been laying in bed with his eyes closed and only that. Not even sleeping as he sat up in bed. That feral feeling a lingering presence in the back of his skull as he looked at the world outside the window from his room to see the cul-de-sac bathed in sunlight. As soon as he stood he had a sudden feeling of something being off. He slowly looked around the room to see nothing. He didn't like this. This wasn't like him, to be cautious in his own house and in his own room. Something was starting in his heart like a cancer. He wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He connected the sighting and the dream but at that moment something was blocking him from realizing the full scene of what happened in that dream. Haverson walked barefoot to look at himself in the mirror to see that he was pale but no eye bags. As he looked at his visage in the mirror he noticed something with his eyes as he moved a little closer to it.

His cobalt blue eyes had been crystal clear. No bloodshots at all. He touched his face below the eyes to pull back the eyelid and saw nothing red at all. Just clear white. Something was off. That feral feeling grew a little more at that realization as he turned on the water in the faucet and turned it to cold and splashed his face with it until he felt clear headed and turned it off. He dried his face off with a towel and looked back in the mirror. His eyes still unusally clear.

Later that morning, as he sat in the silence of his kitchen at the table researching phenomena related to what he was happening, coming upon an article that caught his attention with the sight of someone in it have that pale and cleared eye look, he heard a soft giggle come from behind him. He turned around to see the scintillating purple hue flash brightly right before his eyes and he reacted like he had just been doused with acid as he yelled and covered his eyes as he fell over in his chair. His eyes burned not painfully but with a sickening sense of pleasure and that made his heart beat in revulsion from this foreign feeling. Haverson dared to uncover his eyes as he looked up at where it was and then at where it could be as he stood up with shaking limbs. He glanced around before turning and running to his kitchen drawer where the locked .45 kimber was. His fidgeting fingers misdialing every button until he found the right sequence and pulled the case loose as he gripped the cold metal and felt reality hit him like a grounding relief as he grabbed it and turned around with a pivot and looked desperately for anything and seeing nothing at all.

He cursed and had a strong feeling to get out of his house. He denied it. Barred it as he went to go check his security alarm and saw nothing tripped it. And at that sight, he knew it couldn't be trusted anymore. He knew what he saw and that feeling wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't imagination. It was real even as he glared at the system with that sickening pleasure still throbbing lightly in his eyes. And then finally he listened to his instinct of getting out and being in the fresh air as he locked the door behind him anyways and zipped up his coat to head to his car. His kimber .45 holstered under his armpit this time. He knew where he was going as he calmed himself. That feral lingering sensation having grown a little more as he noticed it in his chest this time instead of an unarmed emotion. It now had a home.

The stethoscope was strangely like an invasion of cold steel even though Haverson was clear headed now as the last of that sickening pleasure tinged off from his eyes in the waiting room. He looked ahead at one of the unnamed posters on the wall. Reading it and understanding it but not recognizing what it mean as he played that moment of the encounter in his head like something that hooked itself into his hippocampus and made the memory repeat itself again and again even as he looked from the poster to his provider Haley speaking to him in that quiet cadence he grew accustomed to. He shook his head softly as he looked into her chestnut brown eyes, meaning to say he didn't quiet catch that. But she knew already with a faint smile that appeared for a moment before saying in that quiet cadence like an sussuration from an ocean wave.

""Your heart sounds like a metronome, Hal,""

""You sure it's not a Allegro?"" He said with a certain edge to his course and gravel voice.

Haley picked up on that edge and quietly folded her hands together in a calm manner as she looked Hals hands gripping the edge of the procedure chair withe the white of knuckles showing. She also caught the difference in the postures they had and antipode had formed in her thoughts as she looked from his white knuckle grip to his eyes and didn't catch it immediately. Not at first until she was midway through ""What has you-,""

And then it registered as she saw how unusually clear his cobalt blue eyes were. As she paused and studied them with those few silent seconds she also noticed they were moistured over almost like they were glass. Hal squinted at her and started to ask what was wrong before remembering.

""You see it in my eyes too? How clear they are?""

Haley stood up without answer, not too quick or too slow but in a languid motion that told Haverson she was in her clinical detachment as she turned to the counter and pulled open the cabinet without word. She shut it and turned with a ophthalmoscope in hand as Haverson watched her walk towards him without word until she placed a hand on his shoulder in a grounding motion to let him know she was concerned in a manner that needed no panic. He nodded with acknowledgement before speaking and still not noticing that slight edge in his voice.

""Whatever it is started this morning. I don't think I even slept last night. Just closed my eyes and had some kind of fragmented dream,"" he dared to say because he felt comfortable in her presence and trusted her with confidentiality like this.

She knew his clean history but to cement that fact was his high functioning and ordered way of thinking. But for Haverson there was a hesitation that made him notice the edge, the guarded feeling of his hands gripping the procedure chair and his voice a little more rough than usual. That almost unnerved Haverson in a way that spooked him before feeling the leather under his fingers, sensing his heart beating calmly, and remembering that whatever this was had to be dealt with not in fear. He had a feeling deeper than intuition that the violet hue, that foreign and inexplicable thing would sense and manifest itself right in the room with them. And that feeling almost spooked him again at such an unnatural thought. He breathed as he closed his eyes and felt Haleys fingers tighten around his shoulder.

""Don't worry about the dream,"" she said in that cool cadence he had come to known,""Just tell me what happened when you woke up,""

He felt anger burn slowly but steadily like a fed fire at whatever that violet hue had done during his sleep. For what it had done during that encounter. And for this demeanor that he wasn't accustomed to that almost slipped out.

""I woke up,"" he said slowly and with control as he opened his eyes to her eyes softly holding his gaze with that clinical detachment,"" I felt groggy like I hadn't slept at all. I went to go check on myself in the mirror and saw how clear my eyes were. Washed my face with cold water to wake me up. It was still there,""

She studied his eyes with that clinical detachment and read the control he was presenting and knowing that he was unnerved. Haley knew from experience with other patients. And it wasn't prominent in Hal but it was noticeable and enough to make her feel something start to ravel itself around her chest in an almost barely noticeable embrace. Something with the most faint pulsating warmth. Before it disappeared as soon as it appeared and she stood upright and raised the ophthalmoscope to his retinal and saw that his right pupil didn't retract. She also noticed something about his iris. Something like a splinter of a bloodshot was what she would describe it later in private with her colleagues. Only that was what a lack of words at what she saw as she noticed five more strands in his iris. Extremely needle like and would have been undetectable except for a very faint violet hue to them.

She looked in left eye and saw the same aberrations. Carefully noting everything that she saw in his iris with detail that would stick with her as she stood up and did something that betrayed her clinical detachment.

She shrugged extremely uncharacteristically and with a manner that almost unnerved Haverson again as she turned her back to him for a moment that lasted too long for him. Her posture too relaxed. Too calm with her hands in her pockets. And for a moment he thought back to how his hands hand been balled into fists when he saw the violet hue a second time. He didn't like it at all and it made him sit up and ask bluntly.

""What the fuck was that?""

She didn't answer right away but she turned halfway. Her face blank like she had been shell shocked before that clinical detachment filled it within the very second he blinked. She turned to face him and took her hands out of her pockets as she clasped them together in a relaxed manner as she spoke in a manner that betrayed that detachment. Haverson didn't pick up on it at first. He had been to unnerved by that gesture she had done. That look she had before the detachment posture filled that look like a mask that didn't belong, didn't fit, wasn't suppose to have been there at all.

""I'm going to order a sleep study Hal,"" she said,"" I suspect what's wrong with your eyes had been caused from REM sleep that didn't fully saturate your brain in that period of when you had the fragmented dream. Do you have any concerns?""

He stared into her eyes and finally noticed it. He felt his heart start to quicken with an awareness that registered to him as survival as he said nothing. Trying to think. Trying to reason with what he was seeing as he tried to speak without the tongue for it.

Haley nodded. His silence as confirmation of no further concerns.

""I'll have you check in with me tomorrow. At 9am. The sooner you come in after tonight's sleep the better and whatever happens during that dream cycle will still be fresh in your memory,"" she said in that manner he still wasn't picking up on as she walked towards him and stopped before him within inches and said ,""I'm concerned Hal and I want you to know that I'm with you in this. Not at this moment but I will be later,""

""Sleep study,"" he just said flatly in that gravel voice.

""As soon as I can schedule it citizen,"" she started to place a hand on his shoulder before stopping midway and pausing, tilted her head slightly before nodding and letting her hand recede to her side before meeting his eyes and winking almost like a reflex.

She started to turn towards the door and walked with exaggerated sways that accentuated her hips and closed the door behind her.

Haverson felt like he had been taken into a world that didn't respond with reason. Didn't respond to the ways he knew anymore. He didn't know what to say or think or do in that moment before grabbing his faded white shirt and putting it on alongside his dark celadon wax cotton jacket and zipping it up in a manner too calm and detached before heading out of the patient room and down the halls by muscle memory more than sight before walking outside into the gray and clouded over world. The fresh breeze of autumn greeting and caressing his face in a way that ground him as he stood and breathed in that air. Let it ruminate in his lungs like a damn good swig of cold water. And when he walked to his Ford crown Victor and touched the handle, it hit him like a clear bullet to his forehead of realization of what that manner was. It was a jubilant euphoria.

And with that he got in his Ford and sat there trying to find a reason that vanished the moment he opened his eyes this morning. The fragmented dream playing out like a conduit into where he was now.

Part two. Purple Peaks

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night.

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun.

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now.

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow.

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob.

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer.

In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.

In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate.

In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.

In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table.

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe.

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage.

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue.

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration.

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1770725563.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

Long days in the library, constant coffee, constant stress, and a feeling that the brain just shut down halfway through the afternoon. Focus problems started to feel like a permanent trait rather than burnout.

Over the past year, this turned into a deep dive into nootropics and productivity fixes. Modafinil experiments, ADHD screening attempts, and a rotating cast of popular stacks that show up in every Reddit thread. Some mild effects here and there, but nothing that matched the hype or justified how much money kept disappearing.

What shifted things was a throwaway comment from a supervisor who noticed the constant coffee and asked about water intake. Out of curiosity, the roommate actually paid attention to how much plain water was getting consumed during long workdays. It was almost nothing.

After intentionally drinking more water during work hours for a couple of weeks, the change was hard to ignore. Reading papers stopped feeling foggy, writing sessions stretched longer without mental fatigue, and afternoons no longer felt like hitting a wall. Nothing else in the routine changed.

Now there is a mix of relief and embarrassment about how complicated the solution hunt became when something basic was missing the whole time.

Did it change how they think about cognitive fixes going forward?",1,1770725112.0,NootropicsinAustralia,0,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Thyla. Farsul Foster Child. Super Foster Failure. Soon-to-be Subject of Dad Lecture.**

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] March 18, 2137**

The first few days of school drift through my head. All the homework, all the new people, so many people that like my dress. The human teacher Mrs Hartshorn gives me some attention, but I mostly just listen to Mr Taren while she helps the other students around me.

Today isn’t a school day though; today I am home and am watching Raymond run around the whole house and property as I work on my homework. Each time he comes in through the door, his face and clothes get more and more wet with his weird human sweat.

*It’s like a Takkan dripping water everywhere except the humans soak it into their clothes. Maybe Takkans should wear clothes? I wear clothes too now; it’s not that hot.*

I watch from the big windows in the living room while I do more Venlil language work on the pad as Raymond is nearly sprinting back to the restaurant from somewhere deep in the empty forest area in the back of the property. He slows down as he sees me in the window and smiles really big and gives me a wave, which I happily return with my tail and paw. But then his face falls, and he turns his path right towards the house and me.

*Why does he look mad now? Did I wave wrong? No, he wouldn’t be mad at me for nothing. He’s not like that.*

Raymond slows down at the back door and takes a moment to wipe his face with his sleeve before opening the door and stepping inside, kicking his boots off in the process.

“Hey Thyla pup, how’s the homework goin’?’

“It’s okay; Venlil language writing is really easy and boring. I don’t even know why I have to do it since translators do it for me. Oh, Mrs Hartshorn also said that I should be moved up in the classroom, towards the front; she wants me to see the school nurse too about it.”

Raymond’s eyebrows shoot up in response, but he pulls them back down and wags his fingers as his eyes look up to the side while he thinks.

“Uhhh, okay, that’s actually pretty important, but I need to talk with you about somethin’ else, so I’m puttin’ that thought on hold for now. Anyway…” He trails off as he closes the distance between himself and me in the living room. He lets out a big huff as he flops back into the couch across from me and sets his hands on his lap. “Thyla, there’s somethin’ that you need to know as you get settled in here, livin’ around humans, livin’ around me.”

I slowly set my pad and homework down as the tone of Raymond’s voice gets very serious and stern.

“Raymond, what do I need to know?”

“Thyla, since you’ve lived with me, I’ve kept up a vegetarian diet, but as I’m sure you’ve been told, as a human, I have other things I kinda ***need*** to eat as well.”

*Oh, flesh and meat. I guess Raymond is part predator-thing after all…*

“You need to eat meat things? That’s okay, Raymond. I… I can be around that.”

“That’s good. I’ll make it an easy process to ease you in, but… i-it’s not goin’ to be just me eatin’ meat and things like it around here.”

*Who else could… Oh!*

“Missus Oakley?”

“Oh, of course, Zoe too, but I was talkin’ about the restaurant. It’ll be openin’ up here really soon, and at first it’ll just be servin’ regular vegetables and fruits and breads and other things, but as more humans come around, I’d like to start serving fake meat dishes, foods that are made of plants but look and taste like meat.”

“Food that is like flesh but made of plants? Could prey eat it?”

“Absolutely, you could eat it if you wanted to, Thyla, but after that, I’m going to start servin’… ***real meat***.”

“Okay.”

“‘Okay’? You’re fine with that, Thyla? Really?”

“It’s weird, but you’re weird, and humans all are weird. I learned that humans don’t eat real prey anyway; it’s made from goop in big machines. It’s not like you kill prey to eat them, Raymond.”

As the final words leave my mouth, a sad, guilty look fills Raymond’s eyes, and my stomach and heart drop inside me. My tail tucks under my butt, and my ears pin to my head and back.

“Raymond, you don’t kill prey, ***do you***?”

“Thyla… Understand that what I do isn’t exactly normal for humanity as a whole; it’s more restricted to where I come from and how I grew up.”

I feel the words dry up on my tongue as he just directly implies that he kills real prey. Sensing my shock, Raymond manages to continue.

“The Oakley family is from a rural place in our country, and before we ever met the Venlil, we had our own wars strike us hard. My great-grandfather inherited a farm from his father, and on that farm was cattle. They were almost gotten rid of, but the Satellite Wars came around, and power and food were hard to come by for a long while. That herd of cattle kept the family and neighbors fed and healthy durin’ that time. That and the huntin’.”

I feel my paws go up to the side of my head as my jaw drops even more somehow at that last part.

“***Raymond,*** you keep cattle and you hunt?”

“Dammit, huntin’... Uhm, so this takes a bit more explainin’. In the forest region that I grew up in, our ancestors killed most of the native predators centuries ago. This stopped the predators from attackin’ them and killin’ their cattle, but it also meant the native prey had no population checks. When the prey, mostly deer, have nothin’ to keep them in check, the herd gets too big and, as a result, gets sick and starves. Because of this, we as humans have to go and hunt a percentage of these deer every year.”

\*My Da-\****caretaker*** *is an actual killer…*

“***Raymond,*** why didn’t you tell me you killed before?”

“I… Well, you know you were goin’ to go to the orphanage, and then you wouldn’t ever have to learn about that, and I could hide it until you found your new home, but now, I’m really excited to keep you around, but you need to learn more about humans and me and my family specifically. I really am sorry.”

I hold my tongue in my mouth as I clench my jaw and use both eyes pointed forward to stare down Raymond. His breathing becomes sharper and more ragged as I keep my staring. Slowly, Raymond shrinks more and more into himself, and only as I start to see his eyes get wet do I stop my pouting. I uncurl my tail and relax my ears as I stand up off the couch and go around the coffee table, pouncing on Raymond with a hug around him.

“It’s okay, Raymond; thank you for telling me.”

Suddenly, his arms wrap around my entire upper body, and he squeezes me really, ***really*** hard until I can’t breathe at all, and then I’m released with a sharp gasp. He sets me next to him on the couch, and when I can finally talk again, I have to ask a question.

“Raymond, is that how you kill your cattle and the forest prey?”

He freezes for a moment before laughing at my joke and giving me a rough scratch on my head and under my ears, which I readily lean into. 

“No no no, that’s only for lettin’ a puppy know that I care about them. If you really, ***really*** do want to know, I can tell you how we harvest the animals back home.”

*Learn how humans kill? How Raymond kills?*

“Hmmmm, okay.”

“Really?”

“Really.”

“Okay, well, for the cattle, they’re these huge herbivores that graze on the meadows we own. They’re actually just called ‘cattle,’ but it’s also common to just call them ‘cows.’ I’ve only ever killed a single one myself, as we hire a butcher the vast majority of the time, but I killed it the same way the butcher does. One last chance to back out.”

*‘Butcher’ is an awful word. Factory methods for chopping prey up.*

“How did you kill the cow?”

“I was told I had to kill one to make sure I understood where my food was really comin’ from, and the butcher handed me this little device that looks like a small gun.”

“Like the one you have on your hip under your pants?”

“Kinda, this one doesn’t send anything out and can’t be used unless it’s touching the cow. It has a little pin of metal inside, and I pressed it up to the cow's head, on the weak spot, and then clicked the button. The cow instantly went unconscious, and then the butcher killed it right after.”

“Wait, wait, you made it sleep first before killing it?”

“Not exactly ‘asleep,’ but they’re knocked out so they never feel upset or scared as they die. No need to make them suffer for the sake of it.”

“And the cows just let you do that?”

“Yeah, girly, they spend their whole lives around us from birth until death. They’re just animals, so they know we are safe and give them food and water and help.”

“I guess that’s not too bad then. What about the forest prey?”

“The deer, like I said, are wild and free-roaming. They live naturally out in the forest and fields until the huntin’ season comes along, and then hunters need to buy licenses to kill a certain number of them within a specific date range. The Oakley property is large enough to get discounts, and we can hunt within the borders, as a big herd of deer lives in our section of forest. I have this little tower attached to a big tree that I climb a ladder up to early in the mornin’, and then I have an old rifle that I sit around with and wait for a deer to walk by, preferably a male so I can collect the big antlers they have.”

“Antlers like a Sulean?”

“Maybe? I’m not exactly sure what Suleans look like. Anyway though, one comes by, and then I aim and try to shoot it through the heart and both lungs so that it dies nearly instantly. Where the cows are around humans all the time, so they’re not scared; the deer are jumpy and don’t like us all too much, but they get to live free and wild until they’re maybe killed by a human. Because they don’t get stunned unconscious like the cow; they are unfortunately in pain for a moment or two but not long. That’s all I have. What did you think, Thyla? Does knowing make it better or worse?”

*They really have thought about all the ways to kill prey without being mean. Humans are weird.*

“It’s super weird that you kill prey… ***but*** being nice about it is sort of neat, I think. When they tested me for PD, they showed me these videos of Arxur slowly ripping people apart while they screamed, and it… it made me sick. Just, you don’t kill ***people, right,*** Raymond?”

“Thyla, I would never kill an innocent person.”

“An ‘innocent person’? So you might kill someone?”

“Only if they were threatenin’ someone I care about. Your life is much more valuable to me than any stranger’s, human or alien.”

I feel my tail wagging at the mention that I am protected, and I’m soon wrapped in another tight and long hug.

*A parent-guy to make sure I’m safe. Safe from everyone…*

“Raymond, can I see the cows and deer you’re going to kill to make the food here?”

“Cows and… Thyla, kiddo, no way in hell I’m actually goin’ to have live animals brought from Earth to here for food.”

“Then how will you have real meat?”

Raymond turns me back to face him directly, and his eyes drift side to side as he hums to himself just a bit. With a sigh, he tries to answer.

“Girly, can I have you keep a super extra special secret for me if I tell it to you?”

“Uh, yeah? I’m really good at being quiet and sneaking and not telling things!”

His eyes narrow at me, and a slight chill runs down my back before he relaxes his eyes.

“Okay, that’s another concernin’ thing I’ll have to remember, but before that, follow me and I’ll show you the secret of how the meat will get here.”

Raymond stands up off of the couch, and I slide off to follow him through the living room, through the kitchen, and right out through the back door behind the house. He holds the gate open for me and I then walk besides him as we go down the old farm roads and trails that criss-cross his property, my property. We come to a large tree, and Raymond stops for just a moment to take his finger and point it up at something I can’t see in a high branch.

“A different but less important secret that I’d like you to keep is that I’ve had a bunch of hidden cameras installed all around the property borders and across a few lines within the property. They’re all monitored by an AI program, and it’ll alert me on my pad if anyone or any predator critter crosses into the land. Also, it’ll play a distinct Earth bird chirp to let me and anyone familiar know that somethin’ is intrudin’.”

“An Earth bird? What does it sound like?”

Raymond nods and takes his pad out of his pant pocket before pulling up a still image of a little wood-camouflaged bird that has a [cute whistle playing along with it](https://youtu.be/_HNAp_BPf9E).

“That bird is called a whip-poor-will, named after its call. You ever hear that sound, call me if you have your pad on you, or run to the house if you don’t.”

“*‘Hear whip-poor-will call Raymond or run home,’* okay, Raymond.”

He gives my head a soft ruffle in response as we continue down a new path that I haven’t been down yet with him during our walks. Deep into the golden glowing woods, we come across a small, steaming, smelly creek, and Raymond suddenly turns upstream and walks towards a thicket of bushes and trees. I follow behind him as he winds up a nearly invisible path, and the gross smell of the water gets even stronger. Finally, we enter a three-sided cove where a few large pools of steaming water are coming up out of the ground. One of the pools has a thick cable coming out of it and going right to a stone wall in the cove.

“Thyla, welcome to the hot spring hollow. The heart of the future operations of the Table Rock Bar and Grill.”

As I try to hold my nose close from the bathroom-like smell of the water, Raymond goes up to the rock wall where the cable goes, and he pulls out a metal key that he inserts into the rock. With a turn, the flush rock pops out and reveals itself as a big door! He opens it up and flips a light switch inside, revealing a clean-cut cave and a few big metal machines along a wall. He enters, and I reluctantly follow him inside.

“Raymond, is this the secret?”

“It sure is; these three big metal machines are all meat production vats. I’m not exactly supposed to have these, and I’ll get in big trouble if anyone knows I do, so you can’t tell anyone, and if you hear someone talkin’ about it, no matter who, immediately message me or come tell me, okay?”

“Yes, Raymond.”

“You want to know how they work, or is it a bit too gross for you?”

“It is gross and weird, but I already said humans are gross and weird. Tell me how they work Raymond!”

“So it needs three things to work properly: electricity, which here comes from the geothermal power of the hot springs; biogel, which I can now order since I need a medical business license to buy the emergency aid supplies I plan to have for both a dance hall and restaurant; and then just the genetic code from which the meat will be made, which I have from a few of the animals back home on the farm.”

“So the meat and flesh made here will taste like what you have at home on Earth?”

“Exactly! I can share a bit of my home and family with everyone who has a bite.”

*Share and be a part of Raymond’s family and home? That sounds… really nice.*

“Raymond… I-I think I’d like to try some of the fake meat, please.”

I was still asleep when the fragile door of my room rumbled in fear and then bust open. The suddenness of it mad me jump out of the bed and roll underneath it, fearing an earthquake. But when the dust settled, I saw my mother standing at the door. As I was crawling out like a puppy, she walked up to me and yelled.. 

""how old do you think you're?"" she doesn't believe in end to end encryption of chats. So she yelled to ensure that not just me but the whole neighbourhood listens. As I was wondering why is she doing this census exercise on a Sunday morning, she resumed ""You will be 30 soon. I won't be here all your life to wash your underwear and feed you three times a day. Find a girl and get married. Why haven't you called Bhasi chettan yet? 

Quick notes : Bhasi chettan is the most respectable socially sanctioned pimp in our village, I mean, wedding broker. Bhasi chettan works on a 20/30/50 strategy. That is 20% payment upfront to register you as his client, 30% after you see a few potential matches and 50 once your marriage is fixed. 

The outburst I just witnessed is the reaction of losing 20% to Bhasi chettan. I was relieved, now I've got some context about her arrival. Otherwise it's not easy catching up with drama of Indian parents. Also why do indian parents think that the purpose of marriage is to find someone to care for you when you're old? Don't they know about the thriving industry of old age homes and geriatric care? Unlike marriage, people get paid there for doing it. But I can't tell her all that. No one talk back to the mother, unless they wish to be homeless. Dad tried once. since he wasn't a quick learner, for two days he slept in his car. 

Later that day I went to see Bhasi chettan. He is a man of small stature. His belly arrived any destination two feet and one second ahead of him. His thick framed glasses rests mostly on his bald head, making his head look like a brown frog. When he saw me, he adjusted the frame to sit on his thick nose that resembled a samosa. He smiled so wide as if he was trying to impress me. Does he think I'm here to marry him?

But behind the smile and through the thick glasses, Bhasi chettan was auditing me. He said ""Amma called, you're almost 30 huh. Look son, 30 is a lakshman Rekha. Once you cross it, you're on your own."" I was staring at his face trying to understand what he just said. He continued, ""Have you heard of No man's land? Similarly, beyond 30 is no woman's land. Cross that line and there is no woman for you."" 

He took a pause and looked at me over his thick frames. Then bringing his smile back he said ""But you don't worry! Why fear when I'm here?"" And laughed. His belly danced to the tune of his laughter. He then asked me about my job. My salary, my career goals, my opinion on the government and so on. Whenever I took more than a second to reply. He said ""Don't worry son, have you not heard it? Never lie to your lawyer, doctor and wedding broker?"" 

I felt that Im facing an IIM interview panel. Questions flew from all subjects and streams, even had two case studies. There was a time writing ""Quirky, soulful and adventurous"" landed me on dates with baddies. Even though the only adventure I had those days were waking up 5 minutes before client calls, taking the stairs instead of lift and walking two meters more to try a different coffee shop than my usual. All it mattered was if I can show up with some flowers and make the girl laugh. But now all that's in the past. Now if one wants to find a wife, he should pass Bhasi chettan's KAT, Kalyanam aptitude test. 

After the interview, Bhasi chettan said ""This is good enough, I will handle the rest."" Now my quirky, soulful and adventurous profile will go through a transformation in Bhasi chettans hand and become 'Family oriented, highly educated, CIBIL score 800, Handsome gentleman'. He then asked , would I be interested in a few matches with COV certification? 

COV? What's that? 
With the seriousness of a scientist explaining his recent theory, he explained ""COV is Certificate of Virginity. It is to certify the purity of the girl and is signed by a priest, mufti or father. Depending upon which middlemen of God you're fine with."" 

I didn't ask how did they test the virginity. I knew the tolerance and scientific temper of an average indian uncle was as fragile as the concept of purity of women. It breaks if you laugh too loud or sneeze the wrong way. 

As I was riding back home one thing was clear. In the dating market, I had to convince only one person. But in the wedding market, Im required a multi factor authentication. first by Bhasi chettan. Then the girls parents. Girl's uncle's and aunts. Her 3rd grade teacher, her neighbours. The lady from her local salon and a recommendation letter from Pope. You might notice that I missed to mention her approval. Apparently, it wasnt that important. ",1,1770724934.0,TwentiesIndia,1,1.0,False

It was there in the street. Not a remarkable sight. Not even noticeable unless you were looking for it. But he was looking for it. He had to as it started to segment it's way across the neighborhood. From the Johnsons little one story house to Noah's two story castle which wasn't saying it lightly. He had it set up like it was going to be invaded. Motion lights. Sturdy fencing. Beware of dog signs on each side of that fence alongside trespassers will be shot. Enough to make it seem like he was a paranoid recluse. Haverson didn't judge him. He understood. He knew what was out there in the world. At least he thought he did until it showed up in his childhood cul-de-sac. It reflected like a glimmer at first when he noticed it. He brushed it off because it was only a glimmer and nothing stood out. Until that second time when it happened again just days after that first sighting. He had been doing a brisk walk from the park close by to his cul-de-sac. Enjoying the fresh autumn air as he let it saturate his lungs. It had been dusk and the crescent moon starting to rise in the sky. He was whistling softly with his hands in his pockets. His concealed .380 police issued revolver in holster under his armpit. Haverson wasn't law enforcement. Just a concerned citizen. He started to turn the corner of the block, his eyes turning to look ahead and seeing that glimmer again. That same glimmer he saw days before. Only more detailed this time and bolder in color. It was scintillating and with a violet hue to it before disappearing in that instance.

He paused. Unsure of how to process what he just saw. His rational side wanted to explain it was a hallucination. His intuition overrided it with clear precision asking how a hallucination manifests through a clear head with no prior drug, alcohol, or cigarette use. Not even any prescription drugs and no family history of any mental illnesses. He moved a little closer as he felt something he couldn't quite describe at that moment. Some primal feeling. Something feral but not the cold coil of fear. Haverson came to the spot where he thought it had formed and disappeared. Not seeing anything and only feeling that feral emotion like a lingering sensation from the mere sight of whatever it was. Like it was something he wasn't suppose to have seen. He realized he was subconsciously tightening his hands into fists in his pockets before releasing them and looking around. Seeing nothing else he came back home to his own secure perimeter. That lingering sensation refusing to go away even as he laid in bed and drifted off into a world that wasn't recognizable even in his dreams. All he had were fragements of walking upside down through a forest and that scintillating purple hue flashing every so often in his vision as he walked.

When he woke up that morning he felt groggy. Not drained or sore. Just like he had been laying in bed with his eyes closed and only that. Not even sleeping as he sat up in bed. That feral feeling a lingering presence in the back of his skull as he looked at the world outside the window from his room to see the cul-de-sac bathed in sunlight. As soon as he stood he had a sudden feeling of something being off. He slowly looked around the room to see nothing. He didn't like this. This wasn't like him, to be cautious in his own house and in his own room. Something was starting in his heart like a cancer. He wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He connected the sighting and the dream but at that moment something was blocking him from realizing the full scene of what happened in that dream. Haverson walked barefoot to look at himself in the mirror to see that he was pale but no eye bags. As he looked at his visage in the mirror he noticed something with his eyes as he moved a little closer to it.

His cobalt blue eyes had been crystal clear. No bloodshots at all. He touched his face below the eyes to pull back the eyelid and saw nothing red at all. Just clear white. Something was off. That feral feeling grew a little more at that realization as he turned on the water in the faucet and turned it to cold and splashed his face with it until he felt clear headed and turned it off. He dried his face off with a towel and looked back in the mirror. His eyes still unusally clear.

Later that morning, as he sat in the silence of his kitchen at the table researching phenomena related to what he was happening, coming upon an article that caught his attention with the sight of someone in it have that pale and cleared eye look, he heard a soft giggle come from behind him. He turned around to see the scintillating purple hue flash brightly right before his eyes and he reacted like he had just been doused with acid as he yelled and covered his eyes as he fell over in his chair. His eyes burned not painfully but with a sickening sense of pleasure and that made his heart beat in revulsion from this foreign feeling. Haverson dared to uncover his eyes as he looked up at where it was and then at where it could be as he stood up with shaking limbs. He glanced around before turning and running to his kitchen drawer where the locked .45 kimber was. His fidgeting fingers misdialing every button until he found the right sequence and pulled the case loose as he gripped the cold metal and felt reality hit him like a grounding relief as he grabbed it and turned around with a pivot and looked desperately for anything and seeing nothing at all.

He cursed and had a strong feeling to get out of his house. He denied it. Barred it as he went to go check his security alarm and saw nothing tripped it. And at that sight, he knew it couldn't be trusted anymore. He knew what he saw and that feeling wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't imagination. It was real even as he glared at the system with that sickening pleasure still throbbing lightly in his eyes. And then finally he listened to his instinct of getting out and being in the fresh air as he locked the door behind him anyways and zipped up his coat to head to his car. His kimber .45 holstered under his armpit this time. He knew where he was going as he calmed himself. That feral lingering sensation having grown a little more as he noticed it in his chest this time instead of an unarmed emotion. It now had a home.

The stethoscope was strangely like an invasion of cold steel even though Haverson was clear headed now as the last of that sickening pleasure tinged off from his eyes in the waiting room. He looked ahead at one of the unnamed posters on the wall. Reading it and understanding it but not recognizing what it mean as he played that moment of the encounter in his head like something that hooked itself into his hippocampus and made the memory repeat itself again and again even as he looked from the poster to his provider Haley speaking to him in that quiet cadence he grew accustomed to. He shook his head softly as he looked into her chestnut brown eyes, meaning to say he didn't quiet catch that. But she knew already with a faint smile that appeared for a moment before saying in that quiet cadence like an sussuration from an ocean wave.

""Your heart sounds like a metronome, Hal,""

""You sure it's not a Allegro?"" He said with a certain edge to his course and gravel voice.

Haley picked up on that edge and quietly folded her hands together in a calm manner as she looked Hals hands gripping the edge of the procedure chair withe the white of knuckles showing. She also caught the difference in the postures they had and antipode had formed in her thoughts as she looked from his white knuckle grip to his eyes and didn't catch it immediately. Not at first until she was midway through ""What has you-,""

And then it registered as she saw how unusually clear his cobalt blue eyes were. As she paused and studied them with those few silent seconds she also noticed they were moistured over almost like they were glass. Hal squinted at her and started to ask what was wrong before remembering.

""You see it in my eyes too? How clear they are?""

Haley stood up without answer, not too quick or too slow but in a languid motion that told Haverson she was in her clinical detachment as she turned to the counter and pulled open the cabinet without word. She shut it and turned with a ophthalmoscope in hand as Haverson watched her walk towards him without word until she placed a hand on his shoulder in a grounding motion to let him know she was concerned in a manner that needed no panic. He nodded with acknowledgement before speaking and still not noticing that slight edge in his voice.

""Whatever it is started this morning. I don't think I even slept last night. Just closed my eyes and had some kind of fragmented dream,"" he dared to say because he felt comfortable in her presence and trusted her with confidentiality like this.

She knew his clean history but to cement that fact was his high functioning and ordered way of thinking. But for Haverson there was a hesitation that made him notice the edge, the guarded feeling of his hands gripping the procedure chair and his voice a little more rough than usual. That almost unnerved Haverson in a way that spooked him before feeling the leather under his fingers, sensing his heart beating calmly, and remembering that whatever this was had to be dealt with not in fear. He had a feeling deeper than intuition that the violet hue, that foreign and inexplicable thing would sense and manifest itself right in the room with them. And that feeling almost spooked him again at such an unnatural thought. He breathed as he closed his eyes and felt Haleys fingers tighten around his shoulder.

""Don't worry about the dream,"" she said in that cool cadence he had come to known,""Just tell me what happened when you woke up,""

He felt anger burn slowly but steadily like a fed fire at whatever that violet hue had done during his sleep. For what it had done during that encounter. And for this demeanor that he wasn't accustomed to that almost slipped out.

""I woke up,"" he said slowly and with control as he opened his eyes to her eyes softly holding his gaze with that clinical detachment,"" I felt groggy like I hadn't slept at all. I went to go check on myself in the mirror and saw how clear my eyes were. Washed my face with cold water to wake me up. It was still there,""

She studied his eyes with that clinical detachment and read the control he was presenting and knowing that he was unnerved. Haley knew from experience with other patients. And it wasn't prominent in Hal but it was noticeable and enough to make her feel something start to ravel itself around her chest in an almost barely noticeable embrace. Something with the most faint pulsating warmth. Before it disappeared as soon as it appeared and she stood upright and raised the ophthalmoscope to his retinal and saw that his right pupil didn't retract. She also noticed something about his iris. Something like a splinter of a bloodshot was what she would describe it later in private with her colleagues. Only that was what a lack of words at what she saw as she noticed five more strands in his iris. Extremely needle like and would have been undetectable except for a very faint violet hue to them.

She looked in left eye and saw the same aberrations. Carefully noting everything that she saw in his iris with detail that would stick with her as she stood up and did something that betrayed her clinical detachment.

She shrugged extremely uncharacteristically and with a manner that almost unnerved Haverson again as she turned her back to him for a moment that lasted too long for him. Her posture too relaxed. Too calm with her hands in her pockets. And for a moment he thought back to how his hands hand been balled into fists when he saw the violet hue a second time. He didn't like it at all and it made him sit up and ask bluntly.

""What the fuck was that?""

She didn't answer right away but she turned halfway. Her face blank like she had been shell shocked before that clinical detachment filled it within the very second he blinked. She turned to face him and took her hands out of her pockets as she clasped them together in a relaxed manner as she spoke in a manner that betrayed that detachment. Haverson didn't pick up on it at first. He had been to unnerved by that gesture she had done. That look she had before the detachment posture filled that look like a mask that didn't belong, didn't fit, wasn't suppose to have been there at all.

""I'm going to order a sleep study Hal,"" she said,"" I suspect what's wrong with your eyes had been caused from REM sleep that didn't fully saturate your brain in that period of when you had the fragmented dream. Do you have any concerns?""

He stared into her eyes and finally noticed it. He felt his heart start to quicken with an awareness that registered to him as survival as he said nothing. Trying to think. Trying to reason with what he was seeing as he tried to speak without the tongue for it.

Haley nodded. His silence as confirmation of no further concerns.

""I'll have you check in with me tomorrow. At 9am. The sooner you come in after tonight's sleep the better and whatever happens during that dream cycle will still be fresh in your memory,"" she said in that manner he still wasn't picking up on as she walked towards him and stopped before him within inches and said ,""I'm concerned Hal and I want you to know that I'm with you in this. Not at this moment but I will be later,""

""Sleep study,"" he just said flatly in that gravel voice.

""As soon as I can schedule it citizen,"" she started to place a hand on his shoulder before stopping midway and pausing, tilted her head slightly before nodding and letting her hand recede to her side before meeting his eyes and winking almost like a reflex.

She started to turn towards the door and walked with exaggerated sways that accentuated her hips and closed the door behind her.

Haverson felt like he had been taken into a world that didn't respond with reason. Didn't respond to the ways he knew anymore. He didn't know what to say or think or do in that moment before grabbing his faded white shirt and putting it on alongside his dark celadon wax cotton jacket and zipping it up in a manner too calm and detached before heading out of the patient room and down the halls by muscle memory more than sight before walking outside into the gray and clouded over world. The fresh breeze of autumn greeting and caressing his face in a way that ground him as he stood and breathed in that air. Let it ruminate in his lungs like a damn good swig of cold water. And when he walked to his Ford crown Victor and touched the handle, it hit him like a clear bullet to his forehead of realization of what that manner was. It was a jubilant euphoria.

And with that he got in his Ford and sat there trying to find a reason that vanished the moment he opened his eyes this morning. The fragmented dream playing out like a conduit into where he was now.

Part two. Purple Peaks

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night.

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun.

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now.

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow.

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob.

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer.

In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.

In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate.

In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.

In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table.

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe.

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage.

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue.

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration.

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1770724891.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

1r0ypn7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0ypn7,Is the Cod Code Even Worth Cracking?,"I dove deep.  My kitchen smells like a cannery.  My dear wife’s side-eye game is super strong.  

I set out to learn canned code secrets.  For starters I wondered whether cod available on the market, which all appears to begin as dried salt cod, rather than fresh codfish filets, benefits from soaking in water before use as a recipe ingredient.  I divvied up the cod in each of five tins, with half the fish taking a water bath, half remaining in the oil from the can.  All the beakers went into the fridge overnight.  Was the fridge in the lab, er kitchen, big enough for all the experimental apparatus?  Not as far as said wife was concerned.  Still science matches on!

My plan was to incorporate the water-soaked and the oil-bathed cod in a series of recipes to see about noticeable differences.  But before cooking, I conducted taste tests of small forkfuls of the fish.  The results derailed the plan. All the soaked-overnight-in-water cod was dreadful.  No less stringy; no more tender; and leached of whatever good flavors the cod arrived at my countertop with.  Blech.  Science says: Do Not Soak Canned Cod. 

Could I pry any other useful knowledge from the jaws of scientific defeat?   

A.  Not All Canned Cod is the Same.  Within the limits of this limited test population, the subjective quality differences were great.  The Ar de Arte and Samare Classics offerings were way, way nicer than the rest, clearly outstanding in this odd little field.   Fresher tasting, brighter, more tender—but still codlike in that challenging chew way—with no off notes or smells.  The Tricana cod solidly occupied the middle ground.  It’s plain, unobjectionable, very cod-y.   Luças is a big step down, very tough, super stringy, really quite fishy in a not particularly pleasant way, offering oddly metallic notes from chew to chew.  And the Briosa is so dreadful, so far off the scale, that I wondered to meself, “Is this what botulism tastes like—is this my last night on earth?”  There’s an actively unpleasant odor and taste that seem related, a sour, spoiled milk flavor wafting sneakily in the background behind the front-n-center rotten fish odor.  I was grateful only that it happened to be the final fish I sampled.  Oh, and I did eat a bit of both versions, watery and oily, of each can. That’s devotion to the pursuit of knowledge, baby!

2.  I Hate Cod.  I already wasn’t a huge fan.  Cod always struck me as dry, tough to chew.  “Why did I reach for this instead of lovely, luscious sardines?”  But conducting this experiment has added to my store of wisdom.  Now I know: I really, really hate canned cod.  Even the good cans—the Ar de Arte and the Samare—are still cod.  I did take the fish from those two tins and made some potato-cod fritters last night for me supper.  They were fine.  But nearly anything I could’ve whipped up with sardines, mackerel, tuna, or other cans in the cupboard would’ve sparked more joy.  I think cod is getting Marie Kondo’d right out of my pantry.  

One final note:  I did not die (so far) of botulism poisoning. I did, though, realize that I had two more cans of the Briosa cod on the shelf.  One was Best By 2029, like the test can, the other one in 2027–so, far apart in time of canning.  I opened both this morning, wondering—hoping, really—that the test tin was just an oddball outlier.  Nope, whatever is wrong with Briosa cod is apparently their secret recipe, their intended offering to the world.  I’ve still got that unsettling metallic taste in my mouth as I type.  It’s made my coffee taste bad.  My precious coffee!!",9,1770724387.0,CannedSardines,3,0.85,False

It was there in the street. Not a remarkable sight. Not even noticeable unless you were looking for it. But he was looking for it. He had to as it started to segment it's way across the neighborhood. From the Johnsons little one story house to Noah's two story castle which wasn't saying it lightly. He had it set up like it was going to be invaded. Motion lights. Sturdy fencing. Beware of dog signs on each side of that fence alongside trespassers will be shot. Enough to make it seem like he was a paranoid recluse. Haverson didn't judge him. He understood. He knew what was out there in the world. At least he thought he did until it showed up in his childhood cul-de-sac. It reflected like a glimmer at first when he noticed it. He brushed it off because it was only a glimmer and nothing stood out. Until that second time when it happened again just days after that first sighting. He had been doing a brisk walk from the park close by to his cul-de-sac. Enjoying the fresh autumn air as he let it saturate his lungs. It had been dusk and the crescent moon starting to rise in the sky. He was whistling softly with his hands in his pockets. His concealed .380 police issued revolver in holster under his armpit. Haverson wasn't law enforcement. Just a concerned citizen. He started to turn the corner of the block, his eyes turning to look ahead and seeing that glimmer again. That same glimmer he saw days before. Only more detailed this time and bolder in color. It was scintillating and with a violet hue to it before disappearing in that instance. 



He paused. Unsure of how to process what he just saw. His rational side wanted to explain it was a hallucination. His intuition overrided it with clear precision asking how a hallucination manifests through a clear head with no prior drug, alcohol, or cigarette use. Not even any prescription drugs and no family history of any mental illnesses. He moved a little closer as he felt something he couldn't quite describe at that moment. Some primal feeling. Something feral but not the cold coil of fear. Haverson came to the spot where he thought it had formed and disappeared. Not seeing anything and only feeling that feral emotion like a lingering sensation from the mere sight of whatever it was. Like it was something he wasn't suppose to have seen. He realized he was subconsciously tightening his hands into fists in his pockets before releasing them and looking around. Seeing nothing else he came back home to his own secure perimeter. That lingering sensation refusing to go away even as he laid in bed and drifted off into a world that wasn't recognizable even in his dreams. All he had were fragements of walking upside down through a forest and that scintillating purple hue flashing every so often in his vision as he walked. 



When he woke up that morning he felt groggy. Not drained or sore. Just like he had been laying in bed with his eyes closed and only that. Not even sleeping as he sat up in bed. That feral feeling a lingering presence in the back of his skull as he looked at the world outside the window from his room to see the cul-de-sac bathed in sunlight. As soon as he stood he had a sudden feeling of something being off. He slowly looked around the room to see nothing. He didn't like this. This wasn't like him, to be cautious in his own house and in his own room. Something was starting in his heart like a cancer. He wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He connected the sighting and the dream but at that moment something was blocking him from realizing the full scene of what happened in that dream. Haverson walked barefoot to look at himself in the mirror to see that he was pale but no eye bags. As he looked at his visage in the mirror he noticed something with his eyes as he moved a little closer to it. 



His cobalt blue eyes had been crystal clear. No bloodshots at all. He touched his face below the eyes to pull back the eyelid and saw nothing red at all. Just clear white. Something was off. That feral feeling grew a little more at that realization as he turned on the water in the faucet and turned it to cold and splashed his face with it until he felt clear headed and turned it off. He dried his face off with a towel and looked back in the mirror. His eyes still unusally clear.



Later that morning, as he sat in the silence of his kitchen at the table researching phenomena related to what he was happening, coming upon an article that caught his attention with the sight of someone in it have that pale and cleared eye look, he heard a soft giggle come from behind him. He turned around to see the scintillating purple hue flash brightly right before his eyes and he reacted like he had just been doused with acid as he yelled and covered his eyes as he fell over in his chair. His eyes burned not painfully but with a sickening sense of pleasure and that made his heart beat in revulsion from this foreign feeling. Haverson dared to uncover his eyes as he looked up at where it was and then at where it could be as he stood up with shaking limbs. He glanced around before turning and running to his kitchen drawer where the locked .45 kimber was. His fidgeting fingers misdialing every button until he found the right sequence and pulled the case loose as he gripped the cold metal and felt reality hit him like a grounding relief as he grabbed it and turned around with a pivot and looked desperately for anything and seeing nothing at all. 



He cursed and had a strong feeling to get out of his house. He denied it. Barred it as he went to go check his security alarm and saw nothing tripped it. And at that sight, he knew it couldn't be trusted anymore. He knew what he saw and that feeling wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't imagination. It was real even as he glared at the system with that sickening pleasure still throbbing lightly in his eyes. And then finally he listened to his instinct of getting out and being in the fresh air as he locked the door behind him anyways and zipped up his coat to head to his car. His kimber .45 holstered under his armpit this time. He knew where he was going as he calmed himself. That feral lingering sensation having grown a little more as he noticed it in his chest this time instead of an unarmed emotion. It now had a home.



The stethoscope was strangely like an invasion of cold steel even though Haverson was clear headed now as the last of that sickening pleasure tinged off from his eyes in the waiting room. He looked ahead at one of the unnamed posters on the wall. Reading it and understanding it but not recognizing what it mean as he played that moment of the encounter in his head like something that hooked itself into his hippocampus and made the memory repeat itself again and again even as he looked from the poster to his provider Haley speaking to him in that quiet cadence he grew accustomed to. He shook his head softly as he looked into her chestnut brown eyes, meaning to say he didn't quiet catch that. But she knew already with a faint smile that appeared for a moment before saying in that quiet cadence like an sussuration from an ocean wave.



""Your heart sounds like a metronome, Hal,""



""You sure it's not a Allegro?"" He said with a certain edge to his course and gravel voice.



Haley picked up on that edge and quietly folded her hands together in a calm manner as she looked Hals hands gripping the edge of the procedure chair withe the white of knuckles showing. She also caught the difference in the postures they had and antipode had formed in her thoughts as she looked from his white knuckle grip to his eyes and didn't catch it immediately. Not at first until she was midway through ""What has you-,""



And then it registered as she saw how unusually clear his cobalt blue eyes were. As she paused and studied them with those few silent seconds she also noticed they were moistured over almost like they were glass. Hal squinted at her and started to ask what was wrong before remembering. 



""You see it in my eyes too? How clear they are?""



Haley stood up without answer, not too quick or too slow but in a languid motion that told Haverson she was in her clinical detachment as she turned to the counter and pulled open the cabinet without word. She shut it and turned with a ophthalmoscope in hand as Haverson watched her walk towards him without word until she placed a hand on his shoulder in a grounding motion to let him know she was concerned in a manner that needed no panic. He nodded with acknowledgement before speaking and still not noticing that slight edge in his voice.



""Whatever it is started this morning. I don't think I even slept last night. Just closed my eyes and had some kind of fragmented dream,"" he dared to say because he felt comfortable in her presence and trusted her with confidentiality like this.



She knew his clean history but to cement that fact was his high functioning and ordered way of thinking. But for Haverson there was a hesitation that made him notice the edge, the guarded feeling of his hands gripping the procedure chair and his voice a little more rough than usual. That almost unnerved Haverson in a way that spooked him before feeling the leather under his fingers, sensing his heart beating calmly, and remembering that whatever this was had to be dealt with not in fear. He had a feeling deeper than intuition that the violet hue, that foreign and inexplicable thing would sense and manifest itself right in the room with them. And that feeling almost spooked him again at such an unnatural thought. He breathed as he closed his eyes and felt Haleys fingers tighten around his shoulder.



""Don't worry about the dream,"" she said in that cool cadence he had come to known,""Just tell me what happened when you woke up,""



He felt anger burn slowly but steadily like a fed fire at whatever that violet hue had done during his sleep. For what it had done during that encounter. And for this demeanor that he wasn't accustomed to that almost slipped out.



""I woke up,"" he said slowly and with control as he opened his eyes to her eyes softly holding his gaze with that clinical detachment,"" I felt groggy like I hadn't slept at all. I went to go check on myself in the mirror and saw how clear my eyes were. Washed my face with cold water to wake me up. It was still there,""



She studied his eyes with that clinical detachment and read the control he was presenting and knowing that he was unnerved. Haley knew from experience with other patients. And it wasn't prominent in Hal but it was noticeable and enough to make her feel something start to ravel itself around her chest in an almost barely noticeable embrace. Something with the most faint pulsating warmth. Before it disappeared as soon as it appeared and she stood upright and raised the ophthalmoscope to his retinal and saw that his right pupil didn't retract. She also noticed something about his iris. Something like a splinter of a bloodshot was what she would describe it later in private with her colleagues. Only that was what a lack of words at what she saw as she noticed five more strands in his iris. Extremely needle like and would have been undetectable except for a very faint violet hue to them. 



She looked in left eye and saw the same aberrations. Carefully noting everything that she saw in his iris with detail that would stick with her as she stood up and did something that betrayed her clinical detachment. 



She shrugged extremely uncharacteristically and with a manner that almost unnerved Haverson again as she turned her back to him for a moment that lasted too long for him. Her posture too relaxed. Too calm with her hands in her pockets. And for a moment he thought back to how his hands hand been balled into fists when he saw the violet hue a second time. He didn't like it at all and it made him sit up and ask bluntly.



""What the fuck was that?""



She didn't answer right away but she turned halfway. Her face blank like she had been shell shocked before that clinical detachment filled it within the very second he blinked. She turned to face him and took her hands out of her pockets as she clasped them together in a relaxed manner as she spoke in a manner that betrayed that detachment. Haverson didn't pick up on it at first. He had been to unnerved by that gesture she had done. That look she had before the detachment posture filled that look like a mask that didn't belong, didn't fit, wasn't suppose to have been there at all.



""I'm going to order a sleep study Hal,"" she said,"" I suspect what's wrong with your eyes had been caused from REM sleep that didn't fully saturate your brain in that period of when you had the fragmented dream. Do you have any concerns?""



He stared into her eyes and finally noticed it. He felt his heart start to quicken with an awareness that registered to him as survival as he said nothing. Trying to think. Trying to reason with what he was seeing as he tried to speak without the tongue for it. 



Haley nodded. His silence as confirmation of no further concerns. 



""I'll have you check in with me tomorrow. At 9am. The sooner you come in after tonight's sleep the better and whatever happens during that dream cycle will still be fresh in your memory,"" she said in that manner he still wasn't picking up on as she walked towards him and stopped before him within inches and said ,""I'm concerned Hal and I want you to know that I'm with you in this. Not at this moment but I will be later,"" 



""Sleep study,"" he just said flatly in that gravel voice.



""As soon as I can schedule it citizen,"" she started to place a hand on his shoulder before stopping midway and pausing, tilted her head slightly before nodding and letting her hand recede to her side before meeting his eyes and winking almost like a reflex. 



She started to turn towards the door and walked with exaggerated sways that accentuated her hips and closed the door behind her.



Haverson felt like he had been taken into a world that didn't respond with reason. Didn't respond to the ways he knew anymore. He didn't know what to say or think or do in that moment before grabbing his faded white shirt and putting it on alongside his dark celadon wax cotton jacket and zipping it up in a manner too calm and detached before heading out of the patient room and down the halls by muscle memory more than sight before walking outside into the gray and clouded over world. The fresh breeze of autumn greeting and caressing his face in a way that ground him as he stood and breathed in that air. Let it ruminate in his lungs like a damn good swig of cold water. And when he walked to his Ford crown Victor and touched the handle, it hit him like a clear bullet to his forehead of realization of what that manner was. It was a jubilant euphoria. 



And with that he got in his Ford and sat there trying to find a reason that vanished the moment he opened his eyes this morning. The fragmented dream playing out like a conduit into where he was now.



Part two. Purple Peaks



And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night. 



He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun. 



Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now. 



""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.



That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""



Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.



""Consummation,""



Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his  other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now  delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow. 



He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob. 



He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer. 

In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.

In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate. 

In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.

In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.



His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what  reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table. 



""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe. 



To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage. 



But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable  purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.



He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue. 



His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration. 



A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.



He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.

And maybe, today’s that day. I woke up to find myself in a graveyard. The sky was sombre, cries of the crows could be heard from a distance, and a foul smell filled the atmosphere. But ironically, I wasn’t scared a bit. This environment oddly comforted me in ways I couldn’t describe. It almost felt like- I’m finally free. Then suddenly, a dark figure emerged, moving towards me at a slow, deliberate pace. And when it came close enough, I saw it clearly- It was a black-robed creature with a skull where its face should have been. Shadows hovered around it like living things, and the instant its presence reached me, a sudden wave of sorrow swept over me.

“Who-Who are you?” I asked as I trembled. The figure stopped pacing. “Hello! No need to be afraid, my dear! I’m Death.” It spoke. “De-Death?? Why-Why are you here?”. This time I was really scared. Death turned its skull towards me for a second and then sat beside me. “I’m sorry I frightened you dear, but I have come here to take you away from this awful world, you can say”.

“Oh, right. It’s time to leave everything behind and accept the ultimate truth of life-death.” I replied plainly.

Death looked at me with concern. “That’s absolutely true,” he said. “But you seem a bit troubled. What’s wrong?” “It’s just, I’m scared. Scared of leaving behind my loved ones. I miss the time I spent with them, the moments I cherish even today, and remembering how happy I was with them is bothering me with a strong feeling of nostalgia. I wish I could have spent more time with them.” I finished.

Death sighed and responded, “I can completely understand how you feel right now. Beautiful, how a mortal soul is loving someone till eternity. I have come across many such cases, each having a different story to tell. So, tell me. Who is that lucky person you don’t want to leave behind? Tell me your story.

I smiled faintly and answered, “It all started in my teenage years. I was a little depressed. Melancholy never left my soul, and socialising was barely my thing. I had always been considered as an ominous or solitary figure and writing was my only coping mechanism. I remember crying for nights, comparing myself with other kids, I-I- I just wanted to be sane, Death. You know that feeling- when you realize you’ll never truly be understood, and your life slowly starts to collapse under a storm of misinterpretation and self-hatred? Yeah, that was my whole life. And no one accepted me at that time.”

Death was patiently listening to me this whole time. He was lost, deep in his own thoughts. After a few seconds, he replied, “I’m sorry you had to go through all this. I can completely understand how you feel, life can be cruel at times. Please continue, dear.”

I nodded. “I was soon becoming a living corpse. But one special day he came. And h-he gave me a reason to live.” I paused as a fragile smile swept over my face.” “Oh, who is he? And how did a single person change everything?” Death asked.

“Oh, him? He was to me what a flame is to a moth. Almost an angel, disguised as human, sent to save this corpse. He was the moon of my darkest nights; I was death, and he was life. And for the very first time, I knew what love truly felt like. I will never truly understand why he fancied me. Among all these people, he was the only one who accepted me, not for what he thinks I am, but for who I am. And I- I never loved him in a casual way or just for the sake of it. That feeling was similar to the excitement I get after seeing cats, the jolt of adrenaline after a jump scare, the pull of addiction when someone tastes alcohol for the first time, the quiet pleasure of that first sip of coffee. I couldn’t help but yearn for him and love just couldn’t contain the depth of what I felt. And by every passing day, I couldn’t help but fall for him- not gently- But obsessively, in an unhealthy way. Even if I tried not to, my mind always ran back to the thoughts of him. My eyes only longed for his photos and texts. My ears were only desperate to hear his sweet voice. My hands only wished to write about him. And my heart-my heart used to beat only for him. The moon is beautiful because it does not shine on its own—it reflects the sun. And I realized I was the moon, and he, was my sun. After I die, when scavengers will feed upon my carcass, all they will taste is him, for my soul is a museum of his love. I remember crying the day he got hit, endlessly hoping that life wouldn’t be so unfair to him. I only wanted to see him happy. I know I wasn’t a very good friend-I never showed enough affection, but I hope he understood. I wish he knew all these things, Death.” I said as tears started to fill my eyes. “I simply cannot live without him; I cannot even die without him. A Moon cannot shine without a Sun, Death. Pl-please just d-do something”.

Death suddenly stood up. “I am deeply touched by your words, dear. The story of you two goes beyond love. I have never heard anything like it before.” He paused, then continued, “I have an idea. I can bring both of you together again.”

I looked at him surprisingly. “To-gether? Again? You mean I’m not going to die?”

“No, no you are dead. But you will be reborn as a black cat, and you will stay with him in his house being his pet.” Death answered. “What? Really?” I gasped. “ Death, I am really thankful to you. You’re so kind”.

Death smiled faintly. “Oh, it’s nothing. To be honest, I enjoy the feeling of being a cupid.”

I laughed softly. “But wait! I never told you his name.”

It was already too late. Death was gone. The cemetery vanished with him. Before me stood a house, and walking out of it… was him. A rush of excitement swept over his tired face. “Oh, hello, little cat. What are you doing here, huh?” he said, lifting me gently into his arms.

It felt exceptionally good to be with him again. I purred happily as he petted me. He laughed softly, then suddenly paused.

“You know what?” He murmured. “ You remind me of her. God, I miss her so much. From now on, you’ll stay with me. Come inside, love.”

However, not everyone has the time, fitness level, or desire to commit to a long**,** demanding, high-altitude trek. This is where the [Everest Mini Trek](https://peregrinetreks.com/everest-mini-trek) stands out as a perfect alternative. Designed for those who want to experience the beauty of the Everest region without extreme altitude or long trekking days, the Everest Mini Trek offers a balanced mix of mountain views, Sherpa culture, and comfortable pacing.

This trek delivers the essence of the Khumbu region in a shorter, more accessible format, making it ideal for first-time trekkers, families, and travelers with limited time.

**What Is the Everest Mini Trek?**

The Everest Mini Trek is a shorter trekking route in Nepal’s Everest region that emphasizes cultural immersion and panoramic mountain scenery rather than reaching extreme altitudes. Unlike the classic Everest Base Camp trek, which climbs above 5,000 meters, this trek generally stays below 3,900 meters.

By limiting altitude gain, the Everest Mini Trek significantly reduces the risk of altitude-related issues while still providing views of Mount Everest and other iconic Himalayan peaks. It allows trekkers to enjoy the journey at a comfortable pace while staying in traditional mountain teahouses and walking through historic Sherpa villages.

**Why the Everest Mini Trek Is a Great Choice**

* **Suitable for Beginners and Families:** One of the most significant advantages of the Everest Mini Trek is its accessibility. The trek is considered easy to moderate and does not require technical climbing skills or prior trekking experience. The daily walking hours are manageable, and rest days are built into the itinerary. Because the maximum altitude is lower than that of many other Everest region treks, the Everest Mini Trek is suitable for families with older children, senior travelers, and anyone concerned about altitude sickness.
* **Short Yet Rewarding:** The Everest Mini Trek typically lasts around ten days, including arrival and departure. This makes it ideal for travelers who want a meaningful Himalayan experience without taking several weeks off work. Despite being shorter, the trek still offers dramatic mountain scenery, cultural encounters, and the iconic flight to Lukla, which is often a highlight in itself.
* **Everest Views Without Extreme Effort:** A common question people ask is whether you can actually see Everest on the Everest Mini Trek. The answer is yes. From viewpoints around Namche Bazaar and nearby ridges, trekkers can enjoy clear views of Mount Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and the striking peak of Ama Dablam. The Everest Mini Trek proves that you do not need to reach Everest Base Camp to enjoy unforgettable Himalayan panoramas.
* **Starting the Journey: Kathmandu to Lukla:** The adventure begins in Kathmandu, Nepal’s bustling capital city. After a short briefing and final preparations, trekkers take a scenic flight to Lukla. This flight is often described as one of the most exciting in the world due to the dramatic mountain approach and short runway. Landing in Lukla marks the start of the Everest Mini Trek. The air feels cooler and cleaner, and the surrounding hills immediately signal that you have entered a different world. From here, the trail leads gently downhill and follows the Dudh Koshi River.

**Walking Through the Khumbu Region**

1. **Phakding and River Valleys:** The first day of walking on the Everest Mini Trek is relaxed and enjoyable. The trail passes through pine forests, small villages, and suspension bridges draped with prayer flags. Stone houses, mani walls, and spinning prayer wheels line the path. This section of the trek helps your body adjust while **introducing you** to Sherpa culture and rural mountain life.
2. **Entering Sagarmatha National Park:** As you ascend, the trail enters the park, a protected area renowned for its natural beauty and cultural significance. The park is home to rare wildlife, alpine forests, and some of the world’s highest mountains. The Everest Mini Trek passes through this park, giving trekkers a chance to experience one of Nepal’s most celebrated landscapes.
3. **Namche Bazaar: Cultural Heart of the Everest Region:** Namche Bazaar is one of the highlights of the Everest Mini Trek. Built into a natural bowl at 3,440 meters, this lively town serves as the main trading center of the Khumbu region. Here, trekkers find bakeries, cafes, small shops, and comfortable lodges. It is also a key acclimatization stop, allowing time for short hikes and exploration. Walks to nearby viewpoints reveal vast mountain panoramas, and visits to nearby villages offer insight into Sherpa traditions, schools, and monasteries. Namche Bazaar is often where trekkers truly fall in love with the Everest region.
4. **Tengboche and Spiritual Life in the Mountains:** One of the most meaningful stops on the Everest Mini Trek is Tengboche. Sitting on a ridge surrounded by towering peaks, Tengboche is home to the region’s most important monastery. The monastery plays a central role in Sherpa spiritual life. Monks perform daily prayers, and the peaceful atmosphere contrasts beautifully with the dramatic Himalayan backdrop. On clear days, the views of Ama Dablam from Tengboche are particularly stunning. For trekkers interested in culture as much as scenery, this part of the Everest Mini Trek is gratifying.
5. **Returning Along Familiar Trails:** After reaching Tengboche, the Everest Mini Trek retraces its route back to essential Namche Bazaar and Lukla. Walking the same paths in reverse offers a new perspective, with changing light and different angles on the surrounding mountains. Evenings are spent in teahouses, sharing meals, warming up with hot drinks, and reflecting on the journey. These moments often become some of the most memorable parts of the trek.

**Accommodation and Food on the Everest Mini Trek**

Throughout the Everest Mini Trek, accommodation is provided in local teahouses. Rooms are simple but comfortable, usually with twin beds and shared bathrooms. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming.

Meals include traditional Nepali dishes such as dal bhat, as well as noodles, soups, rice dishes, and simple Western options. Hot tea and coffee are always available and are an essential part of daily trekking life.

**Best Time to Do the Everest Mini Trek**

The most popular seasons for the Everest Mini Trek are spring, from March to May, and autumn, when the skies are clear and the high-altitude conditions are favorable, from September to November. During these months, the weather is generally stable, the skies are clear, and the mountain views are at their best.

Winter treks are also possible for those who enjoy quieter trails and crisp mountain air, though temperatures can be colder and snow may affect some paths.

**Final Thoughts on the Everest Mini Trek**

The Everest Mini Trek offers an ideal balance between adventure and comfort. It allows travelers to experience the magic of the Everest region without the demands of a strenuous trek or long itineraries.

From the thrilling flight to Lukla and the lively streets of Namche Bazaar to the spiritual calm of Tengboche Monastery, the Everest Mini Trek delivers rich experiences at every step. It proves you do not need to go to extremes to create unforgettable Himalayan memories.",1,1770723950.0,u_ptreks,0,1.0,False
1r0yj3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/1r0yj3q/corporate_salary_tracker_by_the_minute/,Corporate salary tracker by the minute,"Hello hello,

I have made a fun little (depressing - will explain) website. It is aimed at people in corporate jobs with an annual salary who want to procrastinate at work and see how much they are earning while doing so.

I was extremely bored at work and wondered how much I was actually getting paid to sit there and stare at a screen. Not how much I get paid per month, I know that amount - how much I actually got for day dreaming about my dream life for 10 minutes.

So I’ve created a website where you basically input your annual salary (it does not take into account tax as this varies by region and country) or your monthly take home income and how many hours you are contracted to work a week.

It basically then tells you how much you are earning per second/minute which is what can be the slightly depressing part depending on your salary/ how much you enjoy your job.

It was quite fun going to grab a coffee and procrastinate for 20 minutes to come back and find out I had actually earned £5 in that time lol.

It became slightly addictive checking it throughout the day.

I just thought it was fun and an even better way to procrastinate and get through my corporate job ahah

I am also extremely new to designing websites.

If anyone would want to try it out I am happy to send a link to the website - if allowed by the mods :)

Any feedback would be appreciated or potential features I could add to make it funner or more procrastination worthy! Or even more useful in the corporate world!",0,1770723786.0,office,1,0.5,False

The goal is create a moment. Most men remember how they felt that day way more than the object.

Here are stronger options that feel intentional, not rushed:

- The Day That’s All About Him
Plan his entire day without asking him to make a single decision. Morning coffee, favorite lunch, activity he likes, low-key night. Mental effort is one of the most attractive gifts you can give.

- Solve an annoyance in his life
Think about what mildly frustrates him. Messy cables? Cold office? Never has matching socks? Upgrade it. These gifts get used constantly and quietly remind him of you.

- Childhood nostalgia hit
Bring back something from when he was younger. Favorite snacks, a game he loved, a movie from his teen years. Nostalgia is powerful and surprisingly emotional.

- Private appreciation note
Not overly romantic. Just honest. Tell him what he does well, where he shows up for you, what you respect about him. Men almost never hear this clearly.

- Surprise comfort night
Clean space, fresh sheets, his favorite food ready, zero responsibilities. Comfort is underrated but deeply appreciated.

- Inside joke gift
Something only the two of you would understand. Could be funny, slightly ridiculous, or nostalgic. The exclusivity is what makes it special.

- Future anchor gift
Give him something tied to the future: concert tickets, trip plans, a booked activity. Anticipation is part of the gift.

- Make his life easier for a week
Prep meals, organize something he’s been putting off, handle a task he hates. Acts of service read VERY loud.

The real formula for an impressive last minute gift:
Notice something about his life - improve it - add a personal touch.

Most men don’t need grand gestures. They want to feel appreciated, respected, and understood.",1,1770723494.0,GiftIdeasForCouples,0,1.0,False

I’ve tried the dating apps but haven’t really vibed with anyone yet, so I thought I’d do this the slightly old-school way and just put it out here.

If you’re someone who also doesn’t want to spend the 14th doing the usual scrolling or third-wheeling couples, maybe we can change that. Could be coffee, dinner, a long walk, exploring a nice part of the city. I’m pretty easy as long as the conversation flows and the company is good.

Not putting pressure or expectations on it. Just two people meeting, seeing if we get along, and hopefully making the day a little more memorable.

One small change that stuck was simplifying my coffee routine. I used to either overthink it or skip it completely when I was in a rush. Now I just make a quick cup with my Tastlye single-serve coffee maker (it also has a milk frother, which I didn’t expect to use as much as I do). It handles both hot and iced coffee, so I don’t waste time deciding.

What surprised me wasn’t the coffee itself, but how removing friction helped. No setup stress, no mess, no extra decisions — just one consistent step that signals “work mode” for me. I pair it with 10–15 minutes of planning before opening any apps, and my mornings feel calmer and more intentional.

Most of the time I'll have to eat them on my way to work, and sometimes I can eat at home when I wfh, so anything that is portable and easy to eat on the go would be great.

Some mornings I've really struggled with appetite, so I'll settle for a simple protein powder, milk and decaf coffee. But I'm hoping I can meal prep some more various stuff! So far I've really kinda stuck to smoothies (milk, protein powder, oats, chia seeds, and either PB or decaf coffee, etc), and I've discovered I like overnight chia puddings IF they're well blended.

If anyone has suggestions or recipes that fit these criteria, I would really appreciate them!

* I can eat anything for breakfast, does not have to be the Western standard for breakfast food
* LOVE eggs in any form, EXCEPT the texture of omelettes (love scrambled) and baked egg like a frittata (quiche tho I love)
* easy to have on the go
* ideally can be prepped the night before or on the weekend, or even frozen and reheated
* currently struggling with volume, so more nutrient dense (esp high protein) is better
* I actually cannot eat the same thing over and over and over again, max 2 days in a row (somehow I've managed to have the smoothies regularly tho, but getting tired of them)
* not looking for more smoothie recipes :) but pls share your favourite chia seed puddings lol
* no savoury oats please :')

1r0y4gm,https://v.redd.it/un6d7d9vinig1,Millionvillas: Redefining Paradise: The Art of the Luxury Villa Stay,"When we think of vacations, we often think of a ""one size fits all"" approach. For some, it’s about backpacking through mountain trails; for others, it’s the bustling energy of a city center. But lately, a different kind of travel is stealing the spotlight: the luxury villa experience.

The beauty of a villa is that it offers the best of both worlds. You get the privacy of a home with the high-end perks of a five-star hotel. Imagine waking up in a spacious suite, walking straight into your own kitchen for a coffee, and then stepping out onto a sun-drenched terrace—all without seeing a single stranger.

Why it feels different

Unlike a hotel, where you share the pool and wait in line for breakfast, a villa is your own personal sanctuary. However, ""private"" doesn’t mean ""basic."" Many luxury villas now offer bespoke services that rival any resort:

Tailored Wellness: Why go to a crowded spa when the spa can come to you? You can arrange a professional massage right by your private pool, feeling the breeze as you unwind.

Total Comfort: From high-end linens to gourmet kitchens and daily housekeeping, you don't have to lift a finger.

True Freedom: You set the schedule. If you want to swim at midnight or have a long lunch on the patio, the space is yours.

In the end, vacations are about recharging your battery in the way that suits you best. If your idea of heaven is quiet luxury, a private pool, and a personalized massage under the sun, then a villa stay might just be your next perfect getaway.",1,1770722426.0,u_MillionVillas,0,1.0,False

Can't copy the written answers but here are some favs:   


Hot take? 

People who dislike our morally gray king are highly illiterate

Tyler still have a right to crash out, but this crash out should be more like an emotional break-down. Not anger outbursts where he kills or injures people.

Wednesday had forgiven Tyler before the moment she saved him

some people downplay tyler’s actions. he’s done some fucked shit and on his own accord, but that just makes him more compelling!

He was very obviously abused even if not sexually (though I think that one too) very obviously physically, but no one outside the Weyler fandom what’s to acknowledge it.

I would prefer (love) if they didn't date throughout the entire series (or only in the last episode); I prefer a Scrooge McDuck-Goldie type of relationship to a ""normal"" one.

Wyler having a baby together to each there own but I don’t see that being in character for wednesday

They will be Canon.

wednesday never cared that he was a killer, but that he had tricked her and made her emotionally vulnerable.

idk if thats a hot take but both need to ackknowledge how they hurted eachother before they can get back together





Wyler headcanon? 

Everything was real but Tyler fell apart when Wednesday tortured him, he lost all hope.

the have a soul tie like bond between them and they can't escape it

Tyler had been dying for a while to tell Wednesday the things he told her at the police station. That was his way of opening up his true feelings and also seducing her with the dark stuff he knows she likes. It wasn't primarily about gloating at her and it definitely wasn't about intimidating her, it was about sharing intimacy with her

Tyler is good at English/literacy which surprises Wednesday

once they solve their things they have weekly movie dates and they either watch romcoms like they're horror or horror like they're comedies

casual intimacy/physical touch weyler is real and possible

Wednesday took something or Tyler's after visiting the residence after her coma.

They kidnap each other from time to time and afterwards go over what the person could’ve done better.

Wednesday sometimes misses normie barista Tyler

Even after Hyde's revelation, Wednesday still recognized small gestures from the ""human"" Tyler. Wednesday stopped going to Weathervane Coffee because Tyler wouldn't be there anymore. Tyler saw Agnes at the moment Wednesday was being buried alive (note: this is more canon than headcanon, I think).

They’re both a bit touch adverse! Tyler hates hugs because they make him feel trapped and prefers initiating touch and Wednesday isn’t a big fan in general but Tyler knows how to read when she’s okay with it.

After getting together again: Tyler is the only one beside Morticia that is allowed to see Wednesdays hair open and braid it. Playing with it also calms Tyler down a lil bit

  


What part of Wyler do you personally relate to most?

The emotionally complicated relationship

I don't personally relate with them, but i think they're the ones who truly get & accept one another's darkness.

being odd and an outcast among outcast but still finding love and acceptance from loved ones

Tyler and Wednesday as individual characters, they're both incredibly relatable.

Unfortunately I relate to their trauma a lot.I experienced attempted grooming from a professor so I do know how Tyler feels except on a much less extreme level.I also have an avoidant attachment style like both Tyler and Wednesday.They are both so scared to be seen and have their feelings laid out.

The way they act like they don't care about each other but they actually very much do.

Avoidance of emotions but still giving in.

Wednesday being unaware of both of their feelings, yet being so tethered to one another. Ride or die.

I relate to the way Tyler made Wednesday feel seen and how she let herself enjoy being close to someone for once. Their romance felt innocent and special.”

The fact that they both are complicated person and Tyler said that he like Wednesday for the real her and he doesn’t want her to change

The idea that someone can see the worst in you but love you out of choice and change, transforming you both.

I don't have anything to relate (is that bad or good lol). But if I really had to say I am bad at handling situations and both Wednesday and Tyler seem to have struggles in this department.

I identify with Tyler's side of the story, trying to hide his inner conflicts and appear okay, even though he's at war with himself. And also, with how Wednesday tries to control everything, because without that she becomes unstable.

They don't judge themselves, who they are, their tastes or their opinions

Meeting someone new and different who listens and validates your unique parts that others would choose to pretend didn't exist

I think the part where they are literally in love with each other but refuse to show it i mean that s more from Wednesday s part because tyler had no problem expressing that in the cage at willowhill:))

their shared lack of emotional intelligence

To love someone and hate the way it makes you feel, fearing the way you loose control over your emotions. To hate and love at the same time.

For Wednesday, I love a weird girl learning to be vulnerable and open to new experiences. For Tyler, I love a resilient person holding onto that scrap of optimism that things might still work out, even though he's suffered terribly.

Both liked eachother for being different/darker than the rest. And at the same time, both (especially Tyler) wanted someone that accepted them for who they are

1r0y390,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1r0y390/how_to_flirt_with_women_the_psychology_tricks/,# How to Flirt With Women: The Psychology Tricks That Actually Work,"Let me be real with you. Most advice about flirting is garbage. ""Just be confident."" ""Just be yourself."" Cool, thanks for nothing. After falling flat on my face more times than I'd like to admit, I went deep into the psychology behind attraction. I'm talking research papers, evolutionary psychology books, dating coaches who've studied thousands of interactions, and yeah, a lot of trial and error. What I found changed everything.

Here's the thing: attraction isn't random. It's not magic. There are actual psychological patterns at play, and once you understand them, flirting stops feeling like some mysterious art form. It becomes a skill you can actually develop. So let's break down what actually works.

# Step 1: Stop Trying to Impress Her

Your first instinct is probably to show off, to prove your worth, to make her think you're amazing. That's exactly what tanks most interactions. When you're trying too hard to impress someone, you reek of insecurity. Women can smell that shit from a mile away.

**The Paradox**: The less you need her validation, the more attractive you become. This isn't some ""treat em mean, keep em keen"" bullshit. It's about genuinely being comfortable with yourself. When you stop performing for approval, your entire energy shifts. You become relaxed. Playful. Real.

**Research backs this up**: Studies on attraction consistently show that perceived social value matters way more than actual accomplishments. A guy who's comfortable in his own skin beats a guy who's desperately listing his achievements every single time. Dr. Robert Cialdini's work on influence shows that scarcity and independence actually increase perceived value. Translation? When you're not chasing validation, you become more valuable in her eyes.

**Pro tip**: Next time you're talking to someone you're into, catch yourself when you start trying to impress. Stop mid-sentence if you have to. Ask her a question instead. Shift the focus. Watch how the dynamic changes.

# Step 2: Master the Art of Playful Teasing

This is where most guys either go way too soft or way too harsh. Light teasing, when done right, is psychological gold. It creates tension, shows confidence, and makes interactions way more fun than boring interview-style conversations.

**Why it works**: Teasing triggers something called ""approach-avoidance dynamics."" You're essentially creating a mini emotional rollercoaster. One second she's laughing, the next she's playfully defending herself. That emotional variance is what makes conversations memorable. It's way more engaging than just agreeing with everything she says.

The book ""[The Game](https://a.co/d/0aEXqwUY)"" by Neil Strauss gets shit on a lot (and yeah, parts of it are cringe), but it introduced the concept of ""negs"" to mainstream culture. The problem is guys took it too far and started being assholes. Real teasing isn't about putting someone down. It's about playful banter that assumes familiarity and comfort.

**Examples that work**:

* She mentions she's competitive: ""Oh no, one of those people. I bet you're impossible to play board games with.""
* She tells a slightly embarrassing story: ""Wait, that's the most normal thing you've ever done? I'm concerned about what you consider weird.""
* She's dressed up nice: ""Did you get lost on the way to the Met Gala?""

Notice the pattern? You're teasing, but there's a smile in it. You're not being mean. You're being playful. There's a massive difference.

# Step 3: Use Strategic Uncertainty

This one's counterintuitive as hell, but it's backed by solid research. A study published in Psychological Science found that women were more attracted to guys when they weren't sure if the guy liked them back, compared to guys who clearly liked them. Yeah, you read that right.

**The psychology**: When we're uncertain about someone's interest, our brains go into overdrive trying to figure it out. We think about them more. We analyze every interaction. That increased mental attention often gets misinterpreted as attraction. It's basically the Zeigarnik Effect (we remember incomplete or interrupted tasks better than completed ones) applied to romantic interest.

**How to apply this**: Don't lay all your cards on the table immediately. If you're having a great conversation, maybe end it while it's still going well instead of dragging it out until it dies. Don't always be available. Don't text back instantly every single time. I'm not saying play games or be manipulative. I'm saying maintain a little mystery. Keep her wondering a bit.

**Warning**: This is a spice, not the main ingredient. If you overdo this, you just seem uninterested and she'll move on. The goal is ""hmm, I think he's into me but I'm not totally sure"" not ""this guy clearly doesn't give a shit.""

# Step 4: Create Genuine Connection Through Vulnerability

Alright, this might sound contradictory after all that uncertainty talk, but stick with me. Strategic uncertainty gets attention. Genuine connection keeps it. And nothing creates connection faster than vulnerability. Not trauma-dumping, not oversharing, but real, honest vulnerability.

**The research**: Dr. Arthur Aron's famous 36 questions study showed that mutual vulnerability can create closeness between strangers insanely fast. When you share something real about yourself and create space for her to do the same, you bypass all the surface-level bullshit that most conversations get stuck in.

Brené Brown's work on vulnerability has been game-changing. Her book ""Daring Greatly"" (bestseller, research professor at University of Houston, her TED talk has 60 million views) breaks down how vulnerability isn't weakness, it's actually the birthplace of connection, creativity, and belonging. This applies directly to dating. When you have the courage to be real, to admit you don't have everything figured out, you give her permission to do the same.

**What this looks like**:

* Instead of ""I'm a consultant"" (boring), try ""I'm figuring out if consulting is actually what I want to do long-term. Sometimes I think about just saying fuck it and becoming a park ranger."" (real)
* Instead of ""Yeah, I'm close with my family"" (generic), try ""My sister and I didn't talk for like two years over something stupid. We're good now but I still feel weird about how much time we wasted."" (vulnerable)

You're not dumping problems on her. You're being human. There's a huge difference.

# Step 5: Touch (But Make It Natural and Calibrated)

Physical touch is one of the most powerful flirting tools, but it's also where guys fuck up the most. Either they don't touch at all and stay in the friend zone forever, or they're way too aggressive and make it creepy. The key is calibration.

**The science**: Touch releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone. A study in Social Influence found that light, appropriate touch significantly increased compliance and positive feelings in social situations. Another study showed that people who were lightly touched on the arm were more likely to agree to dance requests or give their phone numbers.

**How to do it right**: Start with completely nonsexual, socially acceptable touches. A light touch on the arm when you're making a point. A playful shoulder bump when you're teasing. Guiding her through a crowded space with a hand on her lower back. If she's receptive (she doesn't pull away, she might even lean in or touch you back), you can gradually increase touch throughout the interaction.

**Golden rule**: If there's any hesitation, back off immediately. Consent and comfort are non-negotiable. The goal is to create attraction, not discomfort.

# Step 6: Tell Better Stories

Most people are shit storytellers. They go on forever, include every pointless detail, and don't know how to land a punchline. If you can tell a story well, you're immediately more interesting than 90% of people she talks to.

**Why stories work**: Stories activate multiple parts of the brain. When you tell a good story, her brain literally syncs with yours. This is called neural coupling, studied by researcher Uri Hasson at Princeton. Good stories also make you memorable, create emotional resonance, and showcase your personality way better than facts about yourself.

The book ""[Storyworthy](https://a.co/d/05wMLosb)"" by Matthew Dicks (multiple-time Moth StorySLAM winner, teaches storytelling worldwide) is insanely good for learning how to craft and tell compelling stories. The key insight? Every story needs stakes. Something has to matter. There needs to be a transformation, even a small one.

**Story structure that works**:

* Start in the action (skip the boring setup)
* Build tension (something goes wrong, there's an obstacle)
* Include specific, vivid details (not every detail, just the ones that matter)
* Land it with either a punchline, a realization, or an unexpected twist

Practice telling stories about your life. Not to impress, but to connect. The story about the time you accidentally joined a cult-like yoga retreat is better than the story about your boring day at work.

# Step 7: Ask Questions That Actually Matter

""What do you do?"" ""Where are you from?"" ""What's your favorite movie?"" Snooze fest. These questions are conversational autopilot. They're boring for you, boring for her, and they lead nowhere interesting.

**Better approach**: Ask questions that make people think, that reveal something real. Psychology research on self-disclosure shows that the depth of conversation matters way more than the length. Meaningful conversations create stronger connections than small talk, according to studies by Matthias Mehl.

**Questions that work**:

* ""What's something you believed strongly five years ago that you've completely changed your mind about?""
* ""If you could have dinner with anyone dead or alive, who would actually be the worst choice?""
* ""What's a controversial opinion you have that would make your friends argue with you?""

These questions do two things: they're actually interesting to answer, and they reveal how someone thinks, not just what they do. You learn way more about someone from their controversial opinions than from knowing they're an accountant who likes The Office.

# Step 8: Know When to Escalate and When to Exit

Here's something nobody talks about: knowing when to walk away is just as important as knowing how to flirt. Not every interaction is going to lead somewhere, and that's fine. Attractive people have options and standards. If the vibe isn't there, if she's clearly not interested, or if you're just not feeling it, be cool enough to exit gracefully.

**The psychology**: Outcome independence is attractive. When you're not desperately clinging to every interaction, when you can walk away from someone who's not right for you, you demonstrate self-respect and abundance. That's way more attractive than desperation.

But if the vibe IS there? Escalate. Ask for her number. Suggest getting coffee sometime. Make your interest clear. Ambiguity might create initial attraction, but at some point, someone needs to make a move.

The book ""Models"" by Mark Manson (bestselling author, millions of copies sold, changed the game on honest dating advice) breaks this down perfectly. His concept of ""polarization"" is key. It's better to get clear yes or no responses than to waste time in maybe-land. Be honest about your interest. If she's into it, great. If not, you just saved yourself a ton of time.

For those who want to go deeper into attraction psychology but don't have time to read through dozens of books and research papers, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been helpful. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it pulls from books like the ones mentioned here plus dating psychology research and expert insights to create personalized audio content.

You can set a specific goal like 'become more magnetic as an introvert' and it builds a customized learning plan that evolves based on what resonates with you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged (the sarcastic one hits different). Makes it easy to keep learning during commutes or workouts instead of falling down social media rabbit holes.

Look, flirting isn't some mystical thing that only naturally charismatic people can do. It's a skill built on understanding human psychology, being genuinely interested in people, and having the balls to be real instead of performing some fake version of yourself. Most of what makes flirting work isn't tricks at all. It's about being secure enough in yourself that you can be playful, vulnerable, curious, and honest. The ""tricks"" just give you a framework to operate in until that becomes natural. Now get out there and actually talk to someone instead of overthinking it.",1,1770722311.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False

I slept on the floor and whatever I mean I didn't really care. But when I went to bed I was walking outside a hotel with both of my parents I haven't talked to in a while since we haven't necessarily been on good terms. And my sister call her Maria one of my sisters of course the other wasn't there she was old enough to be out the house by then. But me and Maria were walking around the hotel with our parents when a lady came up to us and started spray painting a circle and a X in the middle of it before filling in the blanks with orange spray paint before walking up to my sister and saying while holding a knife. “your next” (Ngl thinking back at it that was corny as hell 💔) BUT ANYWAY

she tried to stab her I held her back and my mom stabbed her with her car keys as my dad protected Maria and I pryed the knife out of her hand and tried stabbing her with it but I couldn't 😐 nightmares be on demon timing bro. After that a few cars pulled up and the woman ran and literally cut my hand while snatching the knife 💀 and after that people with makeshift weapons knives and guns were everywhere as my mom and dad tried to protect Maria but it was no use as I just stared at Maria she was just on the ground and my dad pulled me away as I caught a glimpse of my mom being shot before waking up and immediately checking on my sisters. They were dead ass watching vampire diaries so that was pointless.

I was so tired I walked to the kitchen to see one of my roommates standing there making some coffee at 5 AM. I know bro has a job but dawg it's nowhere near working hours. I told him about it and said ""Hmmmmmmmm 🤔🤔 sounds spooky"" I swear ong I was about to kill em frfr (not actually) 

but I just wanted to make ts so I didn't forget later cuz I wanna tell some friends about it uhhhhhhh drink while milk and have a good day.

**What is an investment banking internship?**

An investment banking internship is typically a ten-week paid placement and is a key step toward securing a full-time role in the investment banking industry. Banks offer internships across divisions such as global markets, mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, structured finance, and leveraged finance. Interns may be assigned to a specific sector team depending on the bank’s front office structure.



**Who can apply?**

Any undergraduate or postgraduate student with an interest in finance can apply. Internship programs usually target students in their penultimate year who can join full-time after graduation. There is no requirement to study a specific degree. While banks have previously leaned toward STEM backgrounds, this is not mandatory.

Factors that may give candidates an advantage include relevant work experience, industry knowledge, and contacts in the banking sector. Technical knowledge is not always required due to bank training programs, but a basic understanding of financial statements and accounting can help. Commercial awareness is also important.



**Key learning points**

Investment banking interns work closely with analysts and associates on pitchbooks, financial models, and industry research

An internship is an opportunity to learn as much as it is to support colleagues

No work day is the same and varies depending on whether the team is originating or executing a deal

What does an investment banking intern do?

The main responsibility is supporting analysts and associates with marketing materials and company and industry research. Interns may also be assigned an intern-specific project aligned with the team’s business needs. Some financial analysis and modeling may be involved, depending on the work assigned. A week of training usually takes place before work begins to ensure technical proficiency.



**A typical day**

9:00 am - Arrive at the office and check emails for new assignments or comments from senior colleagues. You may be asked to prepare an internal market update newsletter or attend a morning meeting where economists or rates experts discuss recent macroeconomic developments.

10:00 am - Internal team meetings take place in the morning to discuss potential pitches, pitchbook structures, or client pipelines. Interns typically observe and take notes.

11:00 am - An analyst assigns a new project and explains the background of a deal and the timing of a client pitch. The first task is usually compiling a Public Information Book containing annual reports, equity research, sector updates, news articles, and credit rating agency reports.

12:30 pm - Lunch with other interns, usually eaten back at the office.

1:00 pm - The analyst sends a pitchbook shell outlining slide structure and required content. Interns may complete the first draft of selected slides.

3:00 pm - Team introduction talks and events take place during the internship to explain the roles and responsibilities of different teams within the bank.

4:00 pm - The first draft of slides is completed and checked for accuracy, updated information, and perfect formatting. Excel and PDF source files are saved as backups.

5:00 pm - Work continues on the long-term intern project assigned at the beginning of the internship, such as building a precedent transactions database, producing ESG research, or automating Excel files using VBA.

7:30 pm - Dinner is ordered at the desk through a delivery service. Interns usually receive a £20 to £25 dinner allowance and must work until 9:00 or 10:00 pm to expense it.

8:00 pm - The analyst sends comments focusing on slide content and formatting. Changes may include adjusting financials such as adjusted EBITDA, updating charts, and ensuring formatting consistency across slides.

10:00 pm - The revised draft is sent back to the analyst. Administrative tasks such as mandatory training may be completed. Interns may also practice technical skills using online learning platforms.

12:00 am - A new version of the deck is circulated internally after the analyst signs off and is reviewed by senior colleagues the following morning.

1:00 am - After checking if further help is needed, the intern leaves the office and takes an expensed taxi home.



**Investment banking internship top tips**

Learn Excel and PowerPoint, and become comfortable with keyboard shortcuts

Practice technical skills such as accounting, financial modeling, and valuation

Keep up to date with financial markets and macroeconomic indicators

Communicate clearly and confirm receipt of tasks promptly

Network with team members and colleagues across the bank

Converting an internship to a full-time offer

To increase the chances of receiving a full-time offer, interns should network as much as possible. Line managers often ask for feedback from multiple team members when deciding on offers. Coffee chats, work shadowing, and introductory calls increase visibility and reflect positively in feedback. Improving technical skills through online courses and ensuring all work is thoroughly checked are also important.

**Conclusion**

Completing a summer internship is a crucial step in securing a full-time role in investment banking. Internships involve long hours, a fast-paced environment, and high standards. Interns gain insight into life as a junior analyst and work on tasks such as pitchbooks, industry research, and financial modeling. Networking and producing high-quality work increase the likelihood of receiving a full-time offer.

 At that point, I was mostly trying to understand *if* this regulation even mattered to most companies.

That question bothered me enough that I ended up reading the entire CRA text myself (with an unhealthy amount of coffee).

I’m not here to sell anything, just sharing something that surprised me and might save other founders time later.

The **biggest confusion I saw** (and had myself) was very basic:  
*“Does this even apply to my product?”*

Here’s the simplest way CRA scope now makes sense to me:

* CRA is about **products**, not company size
* If you **sell or make a digital product available in the EU**, CRA may apply
* It does **not** matter where your company is registered
* It *does* matter whether you:
   * decide product features,
   * control updates,
   * and ship security fixes

That’s who CRA calls the “manufacturer”, even if you’re a startup or solo founder.

Common assumptions that don’t automatically protect you:

* “We’re SaaS”
* “We’re not based in Europe”
* “We don’t market to the EU directly”

I’ve made a small research survey that helps quickly think through whether a product might be in scope; not legal advice, just a clarity tool. (Feel free to reach out for it!)

I’m now digging into the vulnerability requirements, and honestly, that’s a much bigger rabbit hole.  
 The part I’m currently stuck on is **proof**:

* What will regulators actually accept as evidence?
* How formal does this need to be?
* Are startups expected to mirror enterprise-level compliance artefacts?

Recently I read an[ article that explained this in a way that actually made sense](https://medium.com/@calmnetsleep/overthinking-at-night-and-mental-exhaustion-b176ba20c16d)

It described why mental exhaustion can keep the mind active at night

I ended up reading the whole thing

There was also a short free book linked in it that goes deeper into the same idea

I am sharing this because it made me feel less broken

Why Does Every Day Feel Like I’m in a John Wick Chase Scene?



Picture this: 6:30 in the morning, half-asleep, heading to school for \*extra\* Math lessons (because, you know, apparently seven hours a day just isn’t torturous enough). My mom’s grilling me about trial exams and I’m there like, “Mom, I’m just trying to survive till first break.” Then there’s traffic on Witkoppen Road—actual nightmare fuel. Some guy in a BMW always thinks he’s auditioning for Fast & Furious, weaving through cars like he owns the road. Meanwhile, I’m in my mom’s Polo clutching my coffee like it’s my emotional support animal, praying I don’t end up wearing it. The struggle? Oh, it’s alive and kicking.



Then Chaos Happens Because Of Course It Does



Yesterday at break, we’re just hanging out by the tuckshop, minding our own business. And then, classic Grade 8 move: they start a soccer game with a tennis ball (because, obviously, someone lost the real one). Out of nowhere, the ball smacks straight into Mr. Angry BMW’s ride. Dude storms out looking like he’s about to start WW3 on a bunch of half-grown kids. “WHOSE BALL IS THIS?” he’s screeching, and we’re all suddenly studying the clouds. Grade 8s look like they’re about to faint, and then one kid finally pipes up, “It was an accident, sir!” Mr. BMW is losing it: “AN ACCIDENT? THIS IS A 2024 BMW 330i, NOT A RUBIK’S CUBE!” And then Mrs. X and Y just rolls up, tells him to chill—“It’s a small scratch!”—and he’s freaking out about R15k in repairs. Meanwhile, the rest of us are munching on Takis, living for the free drama. Peak St Peter’s moment, honestly.



Community Questions Because I Need Someone To Suffer With Me



\- Real talk, why does the Wi-Fi only work when we’re NOT trying to hand in our IEB research tasks? Like, is there a secret schedule I don’t know about?

\- Whose bright idea was it to make exams three hours long? My hand goes numb, my will to live evaporates, and I start contemplating alternative career paths. Like, professional napper.

\- Does \*anyone\* actually understand Financial Accounting or are we all just faking it? Be honest.

\- Why is the library printer always dead when I have a deadline? Is this the universe trolling me or what?



The Tired, Delirious, Lowkey Proud Matric Reflection



Let’s be real: we’re all running on academic fumes at this point. My soul is basically a raisin. But you know what? We’ve made it this far. That’s gotta count for something, right? Twelve years of school shenanigans, and now we’re facing the final boss: IEB exams. There’s been chaos—whoopee cushion pranks on Mr. Ring-Ring (he actually laughed, which was weirdly wholesome), Matric Dance drama, caffeine-fueled all-nighters. Sometimes I ask myself why I thought taking 7 subjects was a good idea. Spoiler: it wasn’t. But hey, we’re St Peter’s matrics. We’re built for the grind. Just six more months and we can finally breathe, eat carbs in peace, and stop explaining to our parents why 78% is actually NOT a bad mark.



Stay strong, squad. We’re almost there. I’ll be in the corner, inhaling Jelly Tots and pretending to study Life Sciences. Let’s finish this—distinctions, freedom, and all.



TL;DR: St Peter’s is pure chaos, everyone’s exhausted, but we’re gonna make it. Also, can someone PLEASE explain Financial Accounting to me? Drop an upvote if you’re surviving the struggle, downvote if you’re one of those people who somehow has it all figured out (liar).

1r0xoh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1r0xoh1/forecourt_eye_uk_paid_in_cash/,Forecourt Eye UK - paid in cash :(,"Morning 

I paid £83.42 in cash at a Tesco in Stockport, approx 300 miles from where I live 

I've received a DID NOT PAY letter from Forecourt Eye asking me to pay £83.42 plus £60 admin fee 

I do not have a receipt to prove I did pay in cash as it was last year  
  
Do I have any recourse here? I obviously do not want to pay for something twice, plus £60   
  
I can't remember exactly what the fuel costs were, but I'd guess at £60 plus the shopping  
  
I was thinking Tesco can look at other transactions and see the £83.42, as well as review video footage that'll show me leaving the store with a full Tesco bag and 2x coffees, which whilst not absolutely proving I made payment, will go some way to supporting my claim

Then I found out why my phone charges like a geriatric snail.,"Okay so I'm not a tech guy. I fly helicopters for a living and my idea of ""tech support"" is smacking the GPS when it freezes. For years I just grabbed whatever charger was closest. Gas station specials, the one that came with my old Galaxy, the random one my kid left on the counter. They all worked. Mostly.

Then I started noticing my phone was taking like 3 hours to charge from 40%. I figured the battery was cooked because the phone was two years old. Almost dropped money on a new phone because of it. My buddy who does IT stuff for the Guard looked at me like I was stupid and said bro your charger is literally from 2019 and it puts out 5 watts. Your phone wants 25.

So apparently fast charging is a real thing and not just marketing. Who knew. Not this guy.

Grabbed the Anker Nano 30W because it was the one that kept showing up when I actually bothered to look into it. The thing is comically small. Like I genuinely thought they sent me the wrong product. It's smaller than the old Apple brick my wife has and puts out double the power.

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2MLRF93](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2MLRF93?tag=r-goodvalue-20)

First charge I plugged in at like 15% before a flight brief and by the time I grabbed coffee and came back 20 minutes later it was at 60 something percent. I actually checked twice because I thought the battery indicator was glitching. It wasn't. It's just what 30 watts does apparently when you've been living in the stone age with a 5 watt charger.

The foldable prongs are clutch for travel. I'm TDY a lot and every outlet in a hotel room is behind the nightstand in the most annoying spot possible. This thing folds flat and fits in my flight bag without me even noticing it's there.

Only complaint is there's no cable included which is annoying but honestly I just grabbed a USB C to C cable off Amazon for like six bucks and called it a day. If you're using the charger that came with your phone 3 years ago you're probably in the same boat I was. Your phone isn't dying. Your charger is just ancient.

TL;DR: Thought my phone battery was toast, turns out my charger was putting out 5 watts like it was 2015. The Anker Nano 30W is tiny, charges stupid fast, and I feel dumb for not upgrading sooner.",4,1770720900.0,ProductProbe,0,1.0,False
