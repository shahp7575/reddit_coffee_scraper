1hsstoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/1hsstoz/what_is_your_unpopular_fanfiction_opinions/,What is your unpopular fanfiction opinions ?,"Here's a couple of my opinions that I think would piss off quite a lot of people 
1. I don't like reading fanfiction that takes place in the canon universe 
2. I am not a fan of the Flower shop/Coffee shop/Bakery AUs
3. I actually like fanfiction that takes place in an office setting , but not when both love interests work at an office 
4. School AUs can be done right , but usually aren't . 
5. High-school AUs are better than College AUs
6. I love fanfics where the relationship is already established .

I'm gonna elaborate on the first and second opinions real quick , bc they are the ones I know people will hate .

So , I'm an avid reader of Jujutsu Kaisen , Omniscient Reader and My Hero Academia fanfiction . And I actually avoid most fanfiction that takes place in the actual universes that they are in . I almost only read JJK fanfics that don't take place in the JJK world , so no Curses . For Omniscient Reader , no Scenarios , and for MHA no Quirks . Maybe it's because a lot of stories that include the canon universes also mean that there's a chance of really graphic stuff happening , I just don't read them . I like to read fanfics that are more slice-of-life , not slice-of-life-with-a-high-chance-of-violence . I like vibes , good vibes .

The second opinion is because those AUs are sooooo tired . Like ..... just fund another AU besides those . But if it's a Mafia , Entertainment industry , or college AU , I'm out the door .

Also , obviously these are my opinions . You don't have to agree with them . But please , no negativity .",1,1735927804.0,FanFiction,1,0.67,False

coming straight to point -  really frustrated on my vacation that we booked LionAir for our upcoming flight to Phuket. Trying for last couple days and unable to add-on additional bagged. The card keeps declining. Called card company and they don't see any issues.  It's a international visa card, that I use successfully here at restaurants, Bolt etc.

Now that reading on TripAdvisor and various other threads , it 100% that LionAir doesn't allow foreign credit cards to purchase additional baggage online and they actually charge 10 times when you add it at the airport counter.

1. Only options are to report to airport 4 hrs in advance and purchase additional baggage in Cash or
2. Travel to airport in person days before flight and go to their office to purchase in person.
3. I read that 7-eleven counter payment was allowed, but now it seems only debit, e-wallet and credit (local thai is supported) - screen shot attached.
4. Call center tells me they cannot help much , except for trying 1 and 2 above.
5. The cost right now to add +25KG is 500THB , while at airport its 400THB/kg  = 10K  !!
6. Now I also tried to upload  trueMoney wallet as it listed they allow foreigners , but seems they take 3days to approve and needs tons of documentation.

Well I am a just a easy traveler passing by and wondering if I can pay someone 500TBH to make this payment online for me. I am not sure if anyone can help, We can meet for coffee or anything, I can pay you cash and you can make payment using the modes of payment listed - whatever you choose as per your security.  Again not hoping much but have seen Reditt pull its weight before, so hoping someone can help or will travel to airport tomorrow to find a solution.  Not sure if I can go a travel agency that can make this payement on Saturday /Sunday - my flight is Monday a.m.

Staying close to Central Rama 9,  Huai Khwang

Please DM or let me know any other way to accomplish this 500THB payment - if a travel agency can do it on weekend , pls recommend.

\*\*Lionair if you are reading , its 2025, pls accept international credit cards for ADD-ON services or else it seems very intentional to lure in passengers and extort from them at airport.",1,1735927349.0,Bangkok,2,1.0,False

I (27M) recently moved to Bergamo for work a few weks ago, and honestly, adjusting has been a bit tough. I really like the city, even though I find it a little quiet at times. My Italian isn’t great yet (I’m working on it, I promise!), and while my colleagues are nice, they’re mostly into boring engineering stuff, (I am engineer also)—so it’s not quite the same as having a group of friends to hang out with.

I’m looking to meet people, maybe grab a coffee or a drink, and start feeling more connected here. I’d love to learn more about the city, practice some Italian (or help you with English or Turkish in return), and get out of my apartment for something other than work.

If you’re also new here, or if you’re a local who doesn’t mind hanging out with someone who’s still figuring out the language, hit me up! Recommendations for cool spots, events, or anything fun would be amazing too.

26th November,
My favourite day of winter. On that night, I was sitting with my cup of coffee on my table and thinking about something, but I don't know what I was thinking about at that time. I just remember that I was totally zoned out and constantly staring at my cup of coffee.

Then suddenly, someone came into my room and started chatting with me. I don't know this person, but I have a glimpse of them. It was literally déjà vu. The things happening with me at that time felt like they had happened just 2 years ago.

2 years ago,
2 years ago, the same incident happened to me at a coffee shop near my house. I was sitting on a wooden bench outside the shop. At that time, little rain droplets fell on my face, and it was the best feeling while drinking coffee. Then suddenly, one woman came to me. She wasn’t old enough to call a lady, but she was around 24 to 25 years old. She sat just in front of me and started talking about her boyfriend.

I wasn’t interested in her talk, but I still listened because her tone was very attractive, and her way of talking was so good that anyone could listen to her for hours. Suddenly, the waiter came and asked her to order something, and she ordered the same as me—one coffee and two cookies.

Suddenly, this lady started asking me about my love life. I was 16 years old at that time, and without any hesitation, I started yapping about my love life. But in the middle of the conversation, I realized I had shared too much about myself because this lady seemed so friendly and kind.

At first, I thought this was a dream, but it wasn’t a dream. It was reality. But no lady was sitting with me; I was chatting by myself. I realized this when one waitress at the coffee shop came and asked me,
“Are you okay?”
I said, “Yeah, I’m good,” and left the shop after paying my bill.

Present,
Now today, the person sitting with me in my room is the same lady from that day at the coffee shop. This time, I’m scared as hell, but I still started talking without knowing if this was real or just my imagination. She started talking about that day 2 years ago, and she told me, “I just came to wish a happy birthday to your lover.”

Yes, at that time, I told her about my love life, and I also told her the day my lover was born, which is today, 26th November. She just came to wish her and to see if she was still with me or not. But the whole story is different now, and she was very sad to know that my lover is no longer with me.

She suddenly said, “Happy birthday,” and vanished from my room. Then I woke up crying, and my grandma told me I was dreaming.

I was in shock that this whole thing was a dream. I tried to forget it and went back to my room, sat at my table with a cup of coffee, and one lady came to my room and said,

“Say happy birthday to her…”",1,1735927294.0,writers,1,1.0,False

Right after we matched, he asked me out on a coffee date, so we went out the day after we matched. The fact that he was so proactive and showed interest fast was a big reason why I decided to go on the date even though I was unsure if I found him attractive. The first date was a chill coffee date in my neighborhood. I really liked his personality and we vibed. After the first date, it didn't take long until he asked me if I wanted to meet again. We decided to play shuffleboard and grab some drinks. Again, we hung out for hours and had a really nice time.

After a week or so, his friend (he'd mentioned to me that one of his close friends was dying of cancer...) passed away. I offered my condolences, we chatted, I said that if he needed time now I would understand but that I'm also here if he wants the ""distraction"" and wants to meet up. He said he was meaning to ask me to hang out again but that things had been busy. He wanted to meet up, and then initiated a third date - darts and drinks. Again, we had a good time, this time he dared to be a bit more physical and touched my arm, hands and back several times. (no kiss or anything else though.) So I thought to myself, okay, maybe we're going somewhere. On the third date he also talked about what we could do on the fourth date, and generally showed interest.

Theeen comes Christmas break. I went to my family on 18th of december. (The funeral of his friend was the 17th.) On the 18th he sent a text saying that he was sorry that he'd been a little ""off"" lately, and that things had been a little all consuming. During the holiday I didn't hear much from him. No texts. He sent a few snapchats (we'd also been having regular contact there prior to the Christmas break). He wished me a Merry Christmas on the 24th, didn't hear much after that. I sent a couple of snaps, and he commented on them. He sent a snap again. On New Years eve I send a snap wishing him a Happy new year, and he sent me a snap back wishing me the same. After that, nothing. Feeling pretty disappointed right now, because I think I could've fallen for this guy...

Sooo, now my gut is telling me that's he's just not that into me, and that he maybe realized he doesn't wanna meet me again... The whole ""if he wanted to he would"" keeps playing in my head. Maybe the death of his friend also made him not want to date now, idk... I need some advice. Should I just text him and write something along the lines of ""We haven't had much contact lately so I'm not sure where you stand... But do you want to meet up again?"" OR should I just let it go, and wait and see if he initiates something, and if he doesn't, then just let it go... ?",1,1735927252.0,dating_advice,3,0.67,False

Where do I start?

Back in 2022 I (22F, at that time was 20) started seeing this guy Z I worked with. We only went out for about two months. We went out on a couple of dates, all was going well. One day we slept together and in the morning, I know I was acting weird but I was so on guard from previous times that he was going to completely lose interest after we slept together. After I leave I then do kind of shut down for the next couple of days waiting for the moment he tells me he’s no longer interested - so I understand I didn’t deal with things correctly here. Well well well, three days later he lets me know that he doesn’t think we are the right match. 

Two months later he’s in a relationship. 

My issue is, I’ve never been as infatuated and seemingly “into” someone since him. Like I would genuinely be imagining our life together and we weren’t ever even officially together. 

Since then I’ve been out with a few people but even ended things because I don’t feel my feelings are developing at all. 

Recently 4 months ago I met someone called A (24m) and we live about 2.5hrs apart so don’t get to see each other much. But he’s never been in a relationship before so I think he’s very eager for this to turn into one. I do like him a lot and we get on but the thing that’s holding me back is I feel he lacks a lot of motivation which is really important to me. He even asked me to be official and I said I want to get to know him better first so things aren’t off the cards. But he’s so nice and literally tells me I’m perfect. 

Two weeks ago Z messages me catching up on what we’ve been doing, jobs, life etc and then he also says that he realises he didn’t handle things right those couple of years ago and if i can forgive him if I’d like to meet up for a coffee. 

I told him I’m seeing someone and (he was always a bit too confident) asks me how serious and that if needed he will wait for me!

I wouldn’t meet up with Z while still seeing A, but I feel now I know Z wants to see me it’s really clouding my judgement with A. Still after all these years I can safely say I’m into and attracted to Z and he has that motivation in life! But am I putting him on a pedestal? 

Do I try things properly with A and if not see Z? But I feel my judgement is always going to be bias now I know Z wants to see me again

I'm getting what I call ""racing picture mind"", where my super overactive mind just flashes through a million snapshots faster than I can recognize them. I'm getting DPDR, and I could sleep for like 14 hours a day. 

I have confirmed MCAS but I feel like MCAS flares are usually a day or two, not a week(s). 

I take Zyrtec, ketotifen, and hydroxyzine. 

Is this a flare up? If so, of what? 

Does this happen to all of you as well? Embrace the suck moment? ",2,1735927110.0,covidlonghaulers,1,1.0,False

1hssic2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hssic2/is_it_okay_if_my_friend_watches_andrew_tate/,Is it okay if my friend watches Andrew Tate?,"***Long post ahead***

**Tldr**; my best friend watches videos of Tate because she wants something to ‘challenge her own beliefs’ and is hopeful abt him changing. 

**Context**- Whatsapp convo with my (25F) best friend (25F) last week: another friend asking if 4 cups of coffee a day is too much and my bestie replying with a ‘fun fact’ that she remembers Tate consuming more than that. 
(Side note: We are doctors)
I said over 400 mg caffeine a day can be risky and asked why bring up Tate here; he was likely bragging about a ‘manly’ amount of coffee.
She said she was just fascinated by how ‘hardworking’ people like him take a lot of caffeine to function and that she doesnt think he was bragging. I pointed out that his so-called work mainly consists of tweeting misogynistic and narcissistic shit.
To which she says- “His perspectives have kinda changed in his recent interviews. I do not agree with most of his alpha male shit but he does say some good things, and i admire his work ethic and the power he has over language. Its nice to hear challenging opinions than always stick to ones own beliefs. Thats why i love listening to him.”    
I was confused at this and brought in his sex trafficking allegations (to which she said ‘and there was no evidence, _might I add_ ’) and that a narcissist like him will keep changing his beliefs as per the favourable traction he gets, for eg, his religion (christian > atheist > muslim).

She- “It’s sad that his content turned a lot of good men into assholes. But hey if it’s not him someone else will and they might eventually understand what’s right. And nobody changes in a day. He’s tryin out what’s good for him.  I do think he may be on the right path and eventually realise all the damage. 
As for his religion, he had a childish reason as to why he doesnt think Christ is the real God (she is a devout christian). So if one statement he said might resonate with me doesnt mean I’m his devotee. I feel like you have an issue with me watching his content. As long as i am sure in what i think is right, I think it’s okay to challenge myself with opposing ideals.  Y’all should have some faith in me “

I read the last statement and asked why she ended up taking this personally. She said that she had been questioned previously too with ‘’whyy would youu?’’ whenever she sent a video of his to her other friends. And so she wanted to clarify she knows what she’s watching. 

I didn’t try to debate further and just concluded that the initial coffee fact was still unnecessary since it might not be legit given his inconsistent content (Also he is not a f*cking health professional). And she agreed to that.

That’s it. I am still weirded out by her defending watching his content just because she has enough judgement to delineate good from bad. What’s even the need to dwell into such depths of a mere internet personality who has more likelihood of posting terrible content than useful stuff? She can use all that extra time to watch relatively better people with actual degrees in science and etc. 
I feel like my bestie has always had the ‘I prefer to see the good in people’ thing (more like in a ‘I have a better heart than others’ way) and so she wanted to be different from the multitude of haters and search for the possible good in him, like a needle in a haystack. 

Am I reading into this too hard and should her stance on Tate be seen as a harmless stance?

I WANT to be excited and buy some new plushies on HT, but *forty dollars* is an absolutely fucking deranged ask for a blind box plushie, and like. Listen, I know what I’m talking about here: my house is covered wall to wall in collectibles. Every time I go to teso-x I come home with 10 more blind box figurines/mystery plush. I have over 300 Pokemon “sitting cuties” plushes. (2020 left me with very little else to spend on, lol.) I say all this because I am the PRIMARY TARGET for this kind of plushie. I am literally the exact type of hoarder they want to entice. 

And oh my god, they are so bad at this. Like, I also collect dolls. Forty actual literal united states dollars would get me a collector doll from Rainbow High at its absolute peak: 2 outfits, inset eyes, high quality nylon hair, 14 points of articulation, two outfits, and anywhere from 5-10 accessories. It could buy me anywhere from 2-4 of those blind boxes I mentioned above, depending on which brand and its size. I used to be able to get 4 sitting cutie plushies for that price, but now it’s only 2, and I already stopped collecting THOSE because THAT price increase was too much for me, and like, I love Neopets (clearly, I’m here) but I was literally raised with a Gameboy in my hand and have been playing Pokemon for almost as long as I’ve been alive, so like. Who the hell do you think you are?

“oh they’re bigger than the average blind box plushie” then that was a terrible decision and they shouldn’t have done that, that is not a justification. The ENTIRE TRADEOFF of blind box is that they’re fairly cost efficient, so people are tempted to buy a few and not so pricey that if they don’t get exactly what they want first go, they’ll never buy it again.  That’s exactly why they’re so small. So they can afford to be priced at 10-15 a pop. These are fine looking plushies, but 1. not even worth 40 dollars even if they weren’t blind box and 2. a complete failure of the marketing concepts of blind box toys. I don’t want to hear “well they’re doing this so people will buy multiple because blind boxes sell because of gacha psychology” because this isn’t! even! effective! blind box! psychology! There is an upper limit to most people’s impulse spending! And your initial barrier to access lowers the chance anyone will buy one “on a whim” anyway to get what they want, and even if they do, they won’t be tempted to buy more if they don’t get what they want, and every double will feel like an absolute waste of money.

I live in an expensive city, and 40 dollars is like, basic sushi dinner for one person. (Please do not get me started on omokase, I will be here all day, this is the price of like, appetizer, a fancy roll, a drink, tip.) If I ordered these and got a double, I would feel like I’ve wasted an entire dinner of expensive food, not like, 1.5 fancy coffees. Some people might spend more just to sate that frustration, but not NEARLY enough. This is not the kind of IP where people will spend 40 bucks on obviously jacked up prices. (Pokemon…)

Let me tell you what a successful blind box plush or toy looks like, as someone who is in the toy aisles far more often than I should be.  They are small, no bigger than 6 inches. They have similar base designs to save on cost. They are anywhere from 9-17 dollars. (And the 17 dollar ones usually come with some kind of accessories or are unusually tall/detailed.) 

I know they reused the Aisha and Faellie patterns, but that’s the sole reused design. I’m talking like “every plush is the same basic shape.” If all of these plushies were Aishas or Faellies, fine. If all of these plushies were different but were way smaller, fine. If these plushies weren’t blind boxes but priced the same, ALSO fine. (Ish. 40 bucks is still goddamn expensive for a plush when Jellycats are super high quality and like. Have plenty options under 40 dollars.)

Anyway, my phone is literally lagging with every word I type because I’ve ranted for too long, so tl;dr you guys can’t even do the easy layup of blind box marketing and design, why are you like this. I’d say hire me as a marketer but I have a degree in this and you cannot afford me.",9,1735926728.0,neopets,6,0.71,False

The guards in your building know me by name, know that we have 2 dogs that adore you and me and the life we built, that my mom comes over when she’s in town to make you your favorites and to take you out for wine nights when I’m away, and that your dad grumbles like a schoolboy on our trips to the hospital but lets me take him anyway. They know to let me know when you get home looking particularly pissed, know that in a few I will have coffee or flowers delivered to your doorstep; know that no matter the time of day, if you need me, I will be there. 

In that Universe, you are in the bathroom, the sink lined with your favorite moisurizer that I always steal, humming that one song that was playing when you proposed to me. You know the one. We met at her concert all those years ago and our lives were never the same since. I wait for you on our bed, the one we bought and built together through loud laughters and one tiny, insignificant almost-fight. In that moment I don’t know where you end and where I begin. In that Universe all that I am is all that you want. And there is no fear. 

In that Universe, you smell like dandelions and rainy weekends in September spent lounging half naked in bed. In that Universe, your skin knows my fingertips from all the trips theyve made across your back, all the promises I’ve whispered in your ear, and all the ways I knelt in front of you doing unholy things in your name. 

But in this one you are a stranger. You are unworthy of the words that spill from my chest, the vows that sit at the tip of my tongue. In this one you hurt me and I hurt you and there is nothing else to hold on to but the promise that in all other Universes but this one, you are mine and I am unequivocally yours. 

Poppy, my love, mahal ko, I never thought you’d do this. I never thought I’d let you drop me just like that. Yet here I am and there you are. Ang sakit, love ko. Ang lungkot lungkot lungkot ko. Parang kailangan ko din atang ibenta sasakyan ko. You are in all of the songs that play on the radio, in all the sunsets that shine down on me through my window. Alam mong hindi ako nagsisimba, pero kinausap ko bossing mo kasi hindi ko kaya, mahal. Sabi ko sana po makahanap sya ng ice. Sana po di na sya humaharurot sa highway. Sana po mahalin sya like she deserves to be loved. At sana po masaya sya. 

Despite all of that I wish masaya ka. Ang sakit sakit sakit pero nananalangin ako na masaya ka. That’s all I ever ask for these days bec I know without the shadow of a doubt I know you deserve it. 

Even in this Universe, I know this isnt how it supposed to be. But this is the path you chose for us. And there is no way for me to stop how you choose to align your Universe with mine. I wish you all the best, hon. Even though I fully believe that’s me. 

Sana bukas pag gising ko nadyan ka na ulit asking for a call. Sana bukas pag gising ko hinaharot mo na naman ako. Sana bukas pag gising I’m in that Universe with you :(

This doesnt happen when I work from home at all, I feel totally fine there. But I feel like when I am at the office I am going to pass out. I have previously gotten a doctors note when I first started this job and was having this issue saying I could only work 1 day in office but have since been made to come back to the office 3 days a week since the note expired. I dont know why this happens or what to do about it. Is it the lights? The air? Any insight would be amazing. (also I do make sure to drink a lot of water, I don't have more or less coffee than I do at home and I eat normally as I would at home)

I don’t think I’m in the wrong, at least not entirely. I (27M) have known Tina (28F) since we were 16, we dated in high school (which as an adult I don’t believe counts) and I moved away for school while she stayed in town. I forgot why we broke up when we were younger but we have always been pretty close. She has a business that I have always supported and every couple years we would grab a cup of coffee. She started dating “Tom” maybe 6-7 years ago and they’ve had a decent amount of issues. I never learned much because I didn’t want to over step but they were on and off pretty frequently (I think he cheated on her a bit), whenever they were off and I was in town we would have some fun together. Sometimes it was just platonic hanging out, sometimes there was just a lot of chemistry and we would have sex and talk about starting something (but since I was a couple hours away it never worked out).

A couple months ago, I moved back into town and I wanted to hit her up but I saw she had him on her socials so I left her alone. Maybe a month after she took him completely off and we slowly started talking again. I never asked her if they broke up, or asked her what happened because I figured that was her business and she wouldn’t start anything with me if she wasn’t single. One night we get really drunk and have sex ( let’s say 3 weeks before Xmas), and for some reason she gets really weird and we slowly start talking less but it wasn’t until XMas that I saw that she posted her visiting Tom’s family and took photos with him and everything that a couple would do.

Currently live in a pre war building in NYC.  Long story short we have limited outlets and have had to be creative in the apartment with modern day appliances.  

Kitchen currently has two outlets for a fairly decent sized kitchen.  We used to have a 900w microwave and the fridge sharing one outlet and then the coffee machines, toaster, gas stove in the other.  

Recently just moved the microwave over so the fridge has its own outlet (never blew a fuse surprisingly) 

Question to all is would you all consider the pictured set up generally safe?  The plan is to have the oven plugged in at all times and then for either coffee machine, microwave, blender, etc. plugged in when needed.  Although not convenient my thoughts are probably not best to run these appliances on a multi plug adapter. Second thought is having the microwave sit just above the outlet.

Looking for my other half who is also someone I would consider to be my best friend

I am in Las Vegas hispanic (both my parents are Mexican but I was born in the states, San Diego) 5'9"", 220lbs, brown eyes, No tattoos nor piercings (it's fine to me if you do, but those aren't things I want for myself).

I rarely drink, I don't smoke, I don't vape, and I don't do drugs. Tried them once or twice but never again. I can handle it if you drink so long as it is infrequent or for special occasions or something, but smoking, vaping, and drugs are absolute deal breakers.

Spent most of my 20s working a lot of jobs. I was trying to figure what I wanted and what I can be good for. Worked in construction, restaurants, coffee shops, welding, handyman, auto mechanic, school teacher, office jobs. I’m glad I did all of that because I learned just about anything in any field. 

I used to work on a ship for national geographic as a sous chef. I made breads, deserts, appetizers, crew meals. It’s more of a fill in job. I do have a fulltime job at another ship. Doing the exact same thing. I love it because I get to travel a lot and save a lot of money on rent and bills. 
Since I work on ships I’m almost never in Vegas. I’m always somewhere else. Either in San Diego or in Mexico with my parents. I do work 6 weeks on and 6 weeks off. So dating for me is hard, I understand many can’t do that. And that’s ok.

I am a dual Mexican/American citizenship. I am currently buying a house in Mexico with my parents. I plan to start up my own family style restaurant/ coffee shop in Mexico.
I do go to Mexico often because that’s where my parents live I go about 3-4 times a year. They can’t come to the US. So that’s like an important thing for me. 

About you: I am looking for someone who is kind and caring. Someone who has awareness. Also someone who works hard. Not necessarily has to be a career. I’m looking for someone who is active. 
I’m a pretty active person so I’m looking for someone similar. Also someone who wants to travel and explore new places and experiences. I have traveled mostly by myself all my life and I want to share those moments with someone. I really like unique experiences. For example spending Christmas at Portugal, and then new years at Spain. Stuff like that for example. 
I do want to get to know you in a very personal level. I want to connect with someone. Your wants and likes/dislikes ambitions. I know we all want different things in life and I want to support your dreams and goals and I’ll like to challenge myself to have everything I want plus what you want. 

I’m not looking for a housewife, I can take care of myself just fine. I cook, I clean. I’ll prefer teaming up tasks doing chore/errands and whatnot.

I do want to have kids/ family one day. 
I have thought a lot of raising kids but it’s too much to write it down. So if you’re interested I’ll be happy to talk about it. 

I do ask you to be honest. For example If there’s something you don’t like about me, tell me and we can solve that problem. Vice versa. I’m not here to play games or anything. I just want to have a partner that is willing to go on trips with me and have a good time. 

I don’t mind much of your location. I’m always down to fly/drive, mostly for the adventure.  Or meet you half way. But I am a pretty busy person but I’ll make the time for the right person. 

I'm not too picky or into much about music, but mostly right now I listen to techno or Hans Zimmerman soundtracks. But I don’t mind listening to your music.

I listen to podcasts, usually educational or self improvement type stuff... usually as something to do while l'm out alone on a walk.

I’m a very active person, hobby wise I like to go on hikes, and biking, I also like to go camping. I like to drive very far and go to new cities or parks and just explore and see what’s new to me. And photograph mountains, beaches, sunsets.
I have like 4 cameras so I really like to take photos of everything, even though I still forget to take them. I’m just enjoying the moment haha

Before I worked on a ship, about 2 years ago. I wanted to know more of my body, basically what it could handle. What I mean is I went vegan for 7 months and I lost 60lbs. I also sold my car and I was riding my bike 20-30miles a day. I also fasted a lot. Most I ever did was 5 days. It may not be super interesting but for me it was like a life changing time for me. 

I’m not really into politics, if I had to consider which way I’m leaning would be more on the right. I also believe in God. But I’m open to anyone. I have friends on both sides and atheists who are really close and good friends to me. 
we can go into deep into my views I’m sure it’ll be interesting.

I think I'm pretty funny and sarcastic, though I don't think that's really showing here... come chat with me though and maybe we will see

I am pretty introverted but I’m not a shy person. I only say what I need or want to say. I don’t talk just to talk. And I listen more than I talk. So if you’re someone who talks a lot I don’t mind that. I also like learning from other people. 
I open up a lot more the more comfortable I get.

I’m not really picky but I prefer someone 21-35, no kids, white, Hispanic, Asian someone who lives in the US or Europe, I’d love to go to Europe. 

If you've gotten this far, thank you & leave your age and location in your response, and a bit about you... let's see if we get along.

1hss9bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/throneandliberty/comments/1hss9bh/endurance_vs_evasion_my_input_on_defensive_stats/,Endurance vs. Evasion : my input on defensive stats,"Moving a comment I made on a post in here for better visibility.  
  
Long read ahead but should be a good insight for people interested in the topic.

**TL:DR** :

You can't get enough Endurance and it suffers from crowd control.  
Ranged and Magic evasion is great but you can't get enough without daggers.  
Melee evasion is fantastic but comes with shitty gear and loses value as the scale goes up.  
Pick your poison.

**Where I come from :**  
\- Bow/Dagger : 4200cp - evasion R//M build  
\- GS/Dagger : 4100cp - evasion M/R and evasion R//M builds  
\- GS/Spear : 4250cp - evasion M/R and Triple Endurance builds  
\- Spear/Dagger : 4080cp - evasion R//M build  
\- Crossbows/Daggers, Staff/Daggers - lower cp R//M evasion builds on alt  
\- 1100 hours played, around 850h with evasion and rest with endurance builds

**Evasion :**

\+ you can have significantly more evasion than enemies can have hit chance  
\+ you can dodge crowd control  
\+ best gear in the game is mostly leather - range/magic traits - feeds into R//M evasion builds  
\+ goes really well with the critical damage reduction stat ( of which you can have 18% for basically free with rune synergies )

\- hard to get a relevant amount of R or M evasion without daggers' passive or future spear's passive  
\- feels bad when you get hit by a huge critical hit or a few hits in a row  
\- you have to choose either M/R or R//M evasion, can't have all 3 until T2

**Endurance :**

\+ you can make a triple endurance builds and cover all damage sources  
\+ less damage taken spikes, more healable

  
\- you can not have enough endurance in any of the three to have a reliable chance of forcing minimum damage on enemies  
\- you are tanking all the effects, crowd control, associated with the damage  
\- even though u diminish the critical strike chance of enemies hitting you, every single attack is still a *roll between min and max damage*, where a critical strike only sets the damage to max.   
You can take exactly the same damage from a critical strike than from a non critical strike hit's lucky roll. So you are still vulnerable to huge damage spikes from max rolled non critical attacks.  
\- ranged endurance is ineffective. See follow-up.  
\- melee endurance doesn't counter what makes melee weapons strong. See follow-up.

**Damage types :**

Melee : melee weapons in the game work on a combo base, you have to hit a setup, mostly a crowd control, then followed by the damage. If you miss either one - you are not getting any damage in. Any amount of melee evasion will render melee enemies useless and make them target someone else. Endurance does not come close to melee evasion since it works only on the ""damage"" part of the combo. You will take and spend time in every crowd control melees throw at you and even might die because they can still roll a nearly max damage non critical hit on the follow-up.  
Also melee players - over 700 hit is useless, stop it. You are either gonna face people with 0 melee evasion or 2200 melee evasion. If it's the latter - just switch targets, you ain't killing them.

Ranged : there is not enough ranged endurance available to make it useful. With bow's critical hit chance passive and crossbows always running thunderclouds, you are always facing enemies with much more critical hit chance than you have endurance and while it looks like a ""well at least I reduce their critical chance"" situation where you win something - it isn't. Due to diminishing returns your endurance is ""shaving the top"", the least important points off of their critical hit chance pool and your investment into the stat is giving a very small return in combat.   
Also, not evading ranged crowd control will give you time to go make coffee before the bind effect ends.

Magic : magic damage is an interesting one. So you are facing either a staff or a curse wand. Endurance works wonder against curse wands because you can have more endurance than they have critical chance. The staves you will face will either have a bow, check previous for bow passive explanation giving them absurd 900 critical chance at max range, or with daggers which give critical chance from passives. I'd say magic damage is where the choice between evasion and endurance is the most balanced and down to gearing/preference for other two types since both can work good enough.

**Scale :**

Most important thing to understand : in large scale combat if enough people want you dead - you will die. Neither evasion nor endurance can make you tank a huge amount of people at the same time.  
Melee is way more proficient at small scale PvP - refer yourself to melee damage type explanation.  
Range and Magic dominate large scale PvP ( let's hush the Spear's javelin spam for now, most of you backliners ain't gonna build melee evasion anyway ).

**Conclusion :**

If you made it here - you should be able to formulate a conclusion for yourself.  
Mine is - I am going Melee/Range evasion and whatever I can get the most of for Magic in T2.  
Daggers should go for R//M or M/R evasion builds since they can, depending on what activities they do. Anybody can build Melee evasion for arenas or small scale, but get the second defensive in endurance if you don't have daggers and beware of shitty gear that comes with Melee evasion builds.  
Everybody else you gotta run Endurance even if it's not a great stat. You ain't dodging shit with your 1200 ranged evasion.

I’m seeking advice from those in finance, particularly investment banking, as I evaluate whether I have a legitimate chance of breaking into the industry. I'm 26 years old, I've just graduated from an Ivy League university, played professional football (soccer) for 6 years, and have survived a battle with cancer already. My long-term career goal is to join a private equity fund within the M&A football space - I’ve compiled a list of PE funds invested in the top five leagues in Europe and those are my targets. However, my background is *quite* unconventional compared to most aspiring finance professionals, and I am really looking for advice that's specific to my background and situation.

In the mid-2010s, I began my journey at this same Ivy League university, playing varsity soccer. After my first year, I was offered a professional contract in Europe and decided to take an indefinite leave of absence to pursue my childhood dream/goal. My career started strong, and within a couple of years, I was shortlisted for the Olympic team squad for my country when I was diagnosed with cancer during Covid. Thankfully, I made a full recovery (I’ll be celebrating four years in remission soon!), but returning to football wasn’t as seamless as I had hoped. While I continued playing, I realised my career might not rebound as planned (I ended up retiring this past summer), so I resumed my education through my university’s online program.

A few weeks ago, I graduated with a 3.75 GPA, earning a degree in Data Analytics with a minor in Positive Psychology. Although graduating from an Ivy League school with a strong GPA is an advantage, my unconventional career path meant I couldn’t pursue traditional summer internships as I was playing full-time. That said, the last couple of years I made a very concerted effort to get experience wherever I could to bolster my resume and prepare for the ""real world"" (as my grandparents loved to say 🙃).

I began with part-time consulting for a sports group, organizing ID camps across Europe and focusing on scouting - work that, admittedly, isn’t directly relevant to finance so I won't harp on it. Last summer, I interned for a healthtech startup, primarily handling coding (back end and front end) and integrating analytics into their systems so they could get some data on their users and the usage of the site. Following that, I consulted for a private equity group focused on M&A in football. This opportunity came through a chance meeting with the fund’s president on a train, which led to coffee meetups and discussions about the football industry, and eventually his trust. My work involved first-team decision-making - player budgets, transfer strategies, and financial modeling for the club. Although the deal ultimately fell through, I continue to provide part-time advisory services to the fund, although they are not looking to acquire at the moment. I have even been offered another job as a sports director on another major sporting project in a smaller market, but I am very hesitant to accept it, as I'm not sure that more football experience will help me achieve my long-term goal (the PE sub thinks it could help but I want to be more involved on the deal side and to learn those necessary hard skills that IB or MC can teach).

Currently, I’m working full-time as an intern at a biotech startup, focusing on business development, investments, and fundraising. We’ve recently raised $1 million in pre-seed funding, but I view this role primarily as a stepping stone to gain some experience dealing with money. Now, I’m determined to transition properly into IB - I have plans to enroll in some accreditation courses on financial markets and financial modeling to signal on my resume that I want this, and I believe I have the story and technical capabilities to sell myself in the interviews and get an internship. But I don't even know if this is realistic and if I have a better chance first applying for a masters in finance for example.

At 26 and without traditional finance internships on my resume, do I stand a chance of landing an off-cycle IB internship? Or should I focus my efforts in another direction, possibly management consulting, to eventually achieve my long-term goal?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I truly appreciate any advice you can offer! I know this has been an essay and a half but if you got here, just know I am more than grateful.

1hss1ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hss1ke/puppy_panting_vomiting/,Puppy Panting & Vomiting ,"Hi! I have an 8 month old puppy. His breed is unknown— the vet and I think he’s a combination of shepherd, lab, and possibly pitbull. I haven’t had the chance to get a test done yet. 

Why I’m posting is because my dog has been acting a little strange. Last night we went to bed 4 hours later than usual, and he started panting in bed. He was doing this for around 20 minutes off and on. I opened a window in case he was warm, but it continued. Then this morning I took him on a little coffee run, and he threw up a yellowish liquid. I’m almost certain that it was bile. This is his first doing this. There are no other symptoms, his stool is fine, he’s still high energy, no accidents, no whining or whimpering when I touch certain parts of his body. 

My concern is that I had a friend watch him a couple of days ago, and he gave him a beef bone and I’m thinking that it possibly upset his stomach. I called my vet and they said just to keep an eye on him. 

I’m just wondering if this calls for an emergency vet visit or just keep monitoring over the weekend? ",0,1735925892.0,AskVet,1,0.5,False

On December 1st, 2024 my wife and I went to our first counter service fine dining resturant, Ōre.  First off, thank you u/AcanthocephalaOwn188 for your review here, it inspired us to dine at Ōre rather than many of the other great options in Bangkok.

Located in the BK Salon, the staff greet you in the first building which appears to be a coffee/drink counter.  We were about 25 minutes early to our 2nd seating reservation (we were warned that we cannot trust Bangkok traffic).The resturant suggests arriving 10 minutes early so you can determine your drinks prior to food.  The staff asked us to sit in the small waiting area, served us cold water and presented us with the drink menu for Ōre.  It is a wine list by the bottle, thai cocktail pairing, or tea pairing. I chose the cocktail pairing and my wife chose the tea pairing.  

Once it neared our reservation time, we were escorted through the salon to the main dining space for Ōre.  The resturant has 6 seats and our 2nd seating that evening had 5 diners.  The space is minimalistic, bright and open.  White colors on the diner side are seperated by the large wooden counter from the industrial kitchen area.  We spoke with the beverage manager and confirmed our drink pairings that we determined earlier.  

Ōre is carefully timed, as our evening was 33 courses paired with 6 drinks, and our courses began to flow 5 minutes into our reservation time. 

From here, we were constantly presented with food courses and drinks, each with a staff member explaining what we had in front of us.  

The staff made an effort to explain less common ingredients they chose to use, why they were selected and how it was prepared.
We found this information to be clearly presented, valuable to the context of the chef's process, and important because it spaced our dishes out.  Each dish was typically presented and cleared within 3-4 minutes.  The courses were usually 1-4 bites. We never felt rushed between courses.

Counter resturant dining is not the best place to have a deep conversation with your party.  The kitchen is open and an  entertainment of itself.  There is constant motion, preparations, explanations, plating, and eating to occupy the time.

After 27 courses, all diners are asked to join the staff in a separate area across the salon. This dining space is soft and black in contrast to the hard and white area prior. You are seated at party specific tables at this point, still with a complete view of the new kitchen.

These 6 courses fly by and you are presented a 'book of Ōre'.  It details the development of the resturant and menu with illustrations and the chef's insights.  You cannot take it home but you can take pictures!

At this point your meal is finished and the parting gift was a chocolate muffin and a hand written menu of your meal that day.  The menu changes every day in course number and course variety.

Overall:  Ōre deserves its recommendation from the Michelin guide.  Service was great.  Food was great!  I would 100% dine there again.  
I can see why it did not receive a star though. The beverage pairings were nice but it is not the resturant's priority presently.  25-35 courses a seating is ambitious. Pairing to that much variety is nearly impossible.  The thai cocktail pairing was perfect for 1 out of every 5-6 courses and a similar ratio for the tea pairing.  The drinks were fine for the other courses but not enhancing the food with every sip, most courses. These pairings are a unique offering and allowed both of us to explore new and exciting flavors.  A superior champagne or white wine may be a better path for a more sophisticated diner.

Ore is great now and based on their 'book of Ōre;' still developing new and exciting courses.

1hsrxr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1hsrxr1/my_stalker_of_two_years_almost_tricked_me_to/,My Stalker of Two Years Almost Tricked Me To Meeting Up For Coffee,"Background
I 36(f) used to work at a mental health facility for 5 years, it was great most days and I enjoyed my job and it was my foot in the door to working in the medical field. One thing to note is that worked nightshift and if there wasn't enough staff you would have to hold over for another 8 hours and that's where I met Stalker.

He was a Nurse Practitioner that would make rounds in the morning and if I was on a one to one observation (one staff to one patient assignment for high risk individuals) he would linger and chat knowing I couldn't leave to get away from him.
A note was left on my car one day and I texted it thinking it was about him selling a car ( what our last conversation was about, and mine was falling apart) and that's where the harassment and stalking really kicked off.

He started making comments about my body, asking what I do to stay in shape, asking to take me to dinner, etc. very inappropriate and I let him know I wasn't comfortable with him commenting on my body and that I had a fiance. HE PERSISTED!!! He would say he's not from this country and just trying to be nice and mention all the beautiful women he met in Europe and loves spoiling pretty girls and wants to be friends. Mind you he's in his 50s and I'm in my 20s, and not looking for a sugar daddy.

After a while and several times times letting him know how uncomfortable he was making me feel I just stopped replying to any messages he sent. HE CONTINUED TO MESSAGE ME FOR OVER A YEAR!! If he saw me in the parking lot he would message me, if I was held over on another unit he had patients on he would try to chat, he left multiple notes on my car. I was scared to say anything to HR cause the culture out there was pretty toxic and I was scared I would lose my job if I filed a complaint. After two years of this I never heard from him again, until last week.

So I've moved on from that job, worked for a couple other hospitals in the area, went back to school, and will be graduating as a Surgical Tech this summer. It's been about 6 years since I worked at the mental health facility, but have a few people from there I keep up with on FB. Last week I received a message from a number I didn't recognize saying ""hi this is Steve (fake name) from (facility I worked) hope your having a good holiday season and would love to catch up sometime""

Side note, there was another ""Steve"" there who was a nurse that worked evenings/nights and was just an absolute gem and I would get to work with him often if I was pulled to his unit or he to mine.  This is who I thought had messaged me.

I texted back, excited to hear from my pal, gave a brief update on going back to school, thanked him for his support in encouraging me to persue my education, etc. He asked if we could catch up sometime over dinner, lunch, coffee sometime, and I said coffee sounds lovely and I'll get back in touch after the holidays and schedule something. A plan was set and we decided on my favorite local coffee shop this morning.

As I was getting ready I saw Steve had messaged me saying he was there already, odd but ok, and that the place reminded him of a coffee shop he went to in Amsterdam... It Clicked! I hadn't thought of my stalker in years, but the Steve I know ain't never been to Europe, let alone Amsterdam.  I started to panic, and sent a polite but clarifying text asking if this was Steve from Forensic 1 who helped out in EATO (two of the units I worked) or the Steve who was a clinician. He said Steve from the units. Thank God, or so I thought.

I told him  of my relief because the other Steve was really inappropriate and I was glad it wasn't him. His response had me shook. ""OP's first name, I'm a gentleman as I've spent many years in Europe before coming to America"" Oh Hell No! This was my Stalker, who I hadn't heard from in years, not my jolly male nurse buddy I was looking forward to catching up with. I ask for a pic and he sent me one of him in a tanktop and then said ok now you send one. Absolutely Not!!

I let him have it. I told him how inappropriate he had been to me all those years ago, how I would not be seeing him, and that he can lose my number and blocked him immediately.  I have no idea how he got my number, if he knows where I live, or if he will try to find me at my new job ( I told him the name of the hospital I'm currently working at). This is all so crazy, I told my husband, who I was with during this whole time working at the mental health facility and knows about the history of me and this dude, and another nurse friend from there who remembers the story and saw the messages that he would send me and I wouldn't respond. A little scared, but hoping he finally takes the hint and leaves me alone.",0,1735925622.0,stalker,8,0.22,False

**Tldr**; my bestie watches videos of Tate because she wants something to challenge her own beliefs and also sees some hope in him changing. 

**Context**- Whatsapp convo with my (25F) best friend (25F) last week: another friend asking if 4 cups of coffee a day is too much and bestie replying with a ‘fun fact’ that she remembers Tate consuming more than that. 
(Side note: We are doctors)
I said that over 400 mg caffeine per day can be risky and asked why bring up Tate here, he was likely bragging about a ‘manly’ amount of coffee.
She said she was just fascinated by how ‘hardworking’ people like him take a lot of caffeine to function and that she doesnt think he was bragging. I pointed out that his so-called work mainly consists of tweeting misogynistic and narcissistic shit.
To which she says- “His perspectives have kinda changed in his recent interviews. I do not agree with most of his alpha male shit, but he does say some good things, and i admire his work ethic and the power he has over language. Its nice to hear challenging opinions than always stick to ones own beliefs. Thats why i love listening to him.”    
I was confused then and brought in his sex trafficking allegations (to which she said ‘and there was no evidence, _might I add_ ’) and that a narcissist like him will keep changing his beliefs as per the favourable traction he gets, for eg, his religion (christian > atheist > muslim).

She- “It’s sad that his content turned a lot of good men into assholes. But hey if it’s not him someone else will and they might eventually realise what’s right.
And nobody changes in a day. He’s tryin out what’s good for him.  I do think he may be on the right path and eventually realise the damage he has caused. 
As for his religion, he had a childish reason as to why he doesnt think Christ is the real God (she is a devout christian). So if one statement he said might resonate with me doesnt mean I’m his devotee. I feel like you and other close ones have an issue with me watching his content. As long as i am sure in what i think is right, I think it’s okay to challenge myself with opposing ideals.  Y’all should have some faith in me “

I read the last statement and asked why she ended up taking this personally. She said that she had been questioned previously too with ‘’whyy would youu?’’ whenever she sent a video of his to her other friends and so needed to clarify she knows what she’s watching. 

I didn’t try to debate further and just concluded that the initial coffee fact was still unnecessary since it might not be legit given his inconsistent content (Also he is not a f*cking health professional). And she admitted that yes she should have clarified that it was an internet finding she simply added.

That’s it. I am still weirded out by her defending watching his content just because she has enough judgement to delineate good from bad. What’s even the need to dwell into such depths of a mere internet personality who has more likelihood of posting shitty terrible content than useful ones? She can use all that extra time to watch relatively better people with actual degrees in science and etc. 
I feel like my bestie has always had the ‘I prefer to see the good in people’ thing (more like in a ‘I have a better heart than others’ way) and so she wanted to be different from the multitude of haters and search for the possible good in him, like a needle in a haystack. 

Maybe I am reading into this too hard and her stance on Tate should be seen as harmless.
(Sorry if this was unnecessarily long, I copy-pasted half of the texts)

## The Keurig K-Café Essentials Single-Serve K-Cup Coffee Maker (Black): A Detailed Review

The single-serve coffee maker market is booming, offering a wide range of options to suit every taste and budget.  Finding a reliable and affordable machine that consistently delivers a great cup of coffee can feel overwhelming.  This review focuses on the Keurig K-Café Essentials single-serve K-Cup pod coffee maker in black, addressing common consumer concerns regarding reliability, affordability, and overall performance.  We'll delve into its features, compare it to other models, and analyze customer feedback to help you decide if it's the right coffee maker for you.


## Product Overview: Design, Build, and Key Features

The Keurig K-Café Essentials boasts a sleek, compact design measuring 12.5 x 15.3 x 12 inches.  Its all-black aesthetic is a stylish addition to any kitchen countertop. Constructed from durable plastic and metal components, it feels sturdy and well-built, suggesting a reasonable lifespan.  But let's delve into what makes this model stand out:

* **Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Compatibility:**  The K-Café Essentials utilizes the widely popular K-Cup pod system, providing access to a vast array of coffee blends, teas, and hot cocoa options. This ease of use is a significant advantage for busy individuals.

* **Integrated Milk Frother:** This is a key differentiator. Unlike many basic single-serve brewers, the K-Café Essentials includes a built-in milk frother, allowing you to easily create lattes and cappuccinos.  While not as robust as dedicated frothers, it performs admirably for home use.

* **Strong Brew Option:** For those who prefer a more intense coffee flavor, the strong brew setting delivers a bolder, richer cup. This option caters to those who appreciate a more robust coffee experience.

* **Customizable Cup Sizes:** The K-Café Essentials offers a range of cup sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces), catering to individual preferences and varying mug sizes.

* **42-Ounce Removable Water Reservoir:**  This generous water reservoir significantly reduces the frequency of refills, a major convenience for those who consume multiple cups daily.

* **Auto-Off Feature:**  The automatic shutoff feature contributes to energy efficiency and safety, turning the machine off after a period of inactivity.


## Performance Review: Brewing Time, Milk Frothing, and Strong Brew

The Keurig K-Café Essentials brews a cup of coffee quickly, typically in under two minutes. This speed is comparable to other Keurig models and is a significant advantage for busy mornings.  The milk frother, while not professional-grade, produces a decent amount of foam suitable for lattes and cappuccinos.  The froth consistency can vary slightly depending on the type and temperature of the milk used.  Experimentation may be needed to achieve optimal results.  The strong brew function noticeably enhances the flavor intensity, making it a welcome addition for coffee connoisseurs.  However, it's important to note that the intensity of the brew will also depend on the specific K-Cup used.


## Comparison with Other Models: Keurig K-Café vs. Keurig K-Latte

The Keurig K-Café Essentials often gets compared to the Keurig K-Latte. While both offer milk frothing capabilities, the K-Latte typically comes at a higher price point and includes a larger water reservoir.  The K-Café Essentials prioritizes affordability and streamlined functionality, making it a more budget-friendly option for those who don't need all the bells and whistles of the K-Latte.  The K-Latte might offer slightly more sophisticated frothing capabilities, but the difference is often negligible for home use.  The choice depends on your budget and desired features.


## Customer Reviews and Feedback: Positive and Negative Aspects

Overall, customer reviews for the Keurig K-Café Essentials are largely positive.  Many users praise its ease of use, quick brewing time, and the convenience of the milk frother.  The affordability is another frequently cited advantage.  However, some negative feedback exists.  A few users report occasional inconsistencies in the milk frothing process, citing issues with producing a consistently smooth and creamy texture.  Cleaning the milk frother can also prove slightly more challenging than cleaning other parts of the machine.  Some users have also reported minor issues with the machine's longevity, though these seem to be infrequent.


## Best Price and Where to Buy: Finding the Best Deal

The Keurig K-Café Essentials is widely available at various retailers, both online and in physical stores.  Major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy often carry this model.  Price comparisons are essential to secure the best deal.  Checking for sales, discounts, and bundled offers can significantly impact the final price.  Online marketplaces often offer competitive pricing, but it’s always wise to check reviews for sellers to avoid potential issues.


## Conclusion: Is the Keurig K-Café Essentials Right for You?

The Keurig K-Café Essentials single-serve K-Cup coffee maker in black presents a compelling value proposition.  Its combination of affordability, ease of use, and the integrated milk frother makes it an attractive choice for those seeking a convenient and reliable way to enjoy a variety of coffee and milk-based beverages at home.  While minor drawbacks exist concerning milk frothing consistency and occasional cleaning challenges, these are often outweighed by its numerous advantages.  If you're looking for a stylish, functional, and budget-friendly single-serve coffee maker, the Keurig K-Café Essentials is definitely worth considering.  Remember to compare prices and read recent customer reviews before making your purchase.

Summer, June 2024. After visiting the educational exhibition, I was strongly motivated to create my own psychology project.  That evening, I immediately came up with a lot of ideas, but I settled on being useful to others. I created the Healthy Lifestyle Olympiad project, specifically for students in grades 9-11. I wanted to influence teenagers in the same way that this exhibition once influenced me at the beginning of the summer.

I realized that I would need a lot of energy and resources to influence a large audience. There were no problems with this, I quickly assembled a team of 15 people, and three companies agreed to cooperate and provide financial assistance in my endeavor. As the founder, I delegated tasks, creating a friendly atmosphere in the team, organizing meetings with coffee breaks. 

After a while, we chose the date of the Olympiad. It was October 12th, 2024. But by that time, I had already encountered difficulties when I did not have enough resources to continue the business that brought you pleasure. But, on the other hand, applications for participation in the project were slow to arrive, despite the fact that I invested in the project from the outside as a future psychologist, the amount seemed small, so I would not be sorry to say goodbye to this idea of the Olympics, although in the eyes of others this project has a good development prospect. Deep down, I knew that I would need more time here. And I didn't let myself down. Closer to the date of the Olympics, the number of applications from different cities in my country reached double digits, but the inner emptiness still did not leave me.

My team and I selected about 30 participants and held the Olympiad in 2 stages. The first stage consisted of a knowledge test based on the materials of the film and the book, which were compiled in collaboration with psychologists from my school, and the second stage was an analysis of a situational task with a psychological approach in a team of 4 people. Most of all, I liked the team from the neighboring city, which called itself “Manipulators"", and it wasn't even their name, but the way they presented themselves on the day of the Olympics. 

After the decision of the judge from the WiseFull Center in London, I watched the awarding of the participants from this team among 30 people. After crossing the road in the snow, they came to the project from another city. After the end of the opening ceremony, which I attended, one of the participants came up to me and said:""To be honest, I didn't know it was a psychology Olympiad, my friends and I registered for this Olympiad thinking it was an economics competition, but we came anyway thinking that psychology is not a serious thing. But after the Olympics, I realized that this was far from the case, I gained invaluable experience working with software and I'm thinking about changing my profession

After his words, something flashed through my mind, and I realized that I had achieved my goal by developing psychological literacy, but most importantly, I realized that continuing the project was not in vain, the perseverance I showed in organizing the project showed my efforts.I don't think I'll ever forget his words.

1hsrptq,https://i.redd.it/tus6spfhctae1.jpeg,Preying on vulnerable women - RANT,"First off, more effective than Ozempic?? Has this claim been proven??? Come on, we all know the answer to that.


There is something so sinister about how she has built her platform and empire solely on the backs of vulnerable women. And she has utilized so many tactics to do it. 

Firstly, the MLM model which is a total and complete pyramid scheme. How many women has she convinced can be just as successful as her knowing FULL WELL that the model literally NEEDS all those unsuccessful huns at the bottom to make her rich? How many has she promised guidance and mentorship and business opportunities beyond their wildest dreams and then left them high and dry? 

She also uses fear mongering to make women think they are better off using “her” products for their families. “ThErE’s An OiL fOr ThAt.” Literally, shut the fuck up. Notice how all her miracles that oils performed for her were never spoken of again once she wasn’t making money on it. Same goes for Modere. She is the definition of a con artist.

Mark my words, she has been working out and getting fit behind the scenes and soon we will see a post saying how Make made it all come together!!!!! You can TOTALLY be JUST LIKE HER if you buy her product!!! And you get a 😊discount😊 if you sign up under her!!! 

She is preying on women’s insecurities and fears while she “grows her pile of good things” and those good things are her millions of dollars that she needlessly hoards while everyone she used to get them goes broke beneath her. And she shells out $200 and coffee money like she is some sort of fucking saint.

PLEASE, for the love of GOD, if this disgusts you then don’t click her links, find alternative products if she is shilling something that interests you, don’t but from companies that partner with her. She is taking advantage of you! She SEES your vulnerability and she is EXPLOITING it.

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. Matthew 19:24",4,1735925070.0,MadisonVining,1,1.0,False
1hsrplp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClientlessCopywriting/comments/1hsrplp/how_classic_copywriters_made_clientless/,"How classic copywriters made clientless copywriting work, and you can too.","So i'll have to rewrite this as i used reddits scheduler and it didn't post or save(remember to always have a backup).

Anyways, last night i wrote about how all the big classic copywriters all had their own offers that they sold or did some sort of rev share or royalty DR deal with their clients. That this combination of big being shark that also built their own assets allowed them to make millions. 

Remember im not anti client, but im just big on having your own assets that will make you wealthy over your boss. These offers included their own books, seminars, and their own info products. That was a light bulb moment for me, seeing a thread between all these great copywriters whom we all look up to make millions of dollars and not just through client work. 

And i did the research for you guys so you don't have to, so lets begin. I'll be listing their biggest client, their best money making product and net-worth.

# The legendary Gary Halbert

* **National Enquirer**: Halbert wrote highly successful direct mail campaigns for them, which earned millions. In fact Gary halbert is the most successful in sales, having generated between himself and clients, over 1 Billion dollars. thats Billions with a B.
* **The Gary Halbert Letter**: His personal print newsletter was a big source of income, though it's unclear how much it generated annually. He also made money selling marketing products.
* Halbert here says on his most successful sales letter campaign, I"" wrote the most widely mailed sales letter in history. It revealed how you could purchase (from my company Halbert's Inc.) a copy of your family crest and the history of your last name. Ever hear of that letter? More than 600,000,000 of them have been mailed and it's still going strong. The company that eventually bought me out, was sold last year for 90 million dollars... and... I know about someone who is willing to buy that company... now... at an even higher price.""
* Halberts networth therefore was at least $90 million dollars plus.

# Joe Sugarman (i call him the maverick, (he wore sunglasses))

* **BluBlocker Sunglasses**: Joe’s most iconic product, BluBlocker sunglasses, was a direct result of his copywriting efforts. He created successful TV infomercials and direct-mail campaigns that brought in millions.
* **JS&A Group**: His direct marketing firm that sold products like BluBlocker sunglasses and various tech gadgets through direct-response ads.
* Sugarman's BluBlocker campaigns were hugely profitable, reportedly generating **over $300 million in sales**. It's difficult to break down his exact earnings, but he likely earned **several million dollars** from these ventures. In addition, Sugarman earned royalties from books, infomercials, and other marketing products.

# Dan Kennedy author of the ultimate sales letters

* **The Nightingale-Conant Corporation**: Kennedy wrote copy for their audio programs and sales letters, significantly boosting their sales.
* **Harley-Davidson**: He worked on several marketing campaigns that helped boost sales for this brand.
* Dan Kennedy was known to charge **$25,000 to $100,000** **per project** depending on its scale and impact. He also earned substantial revenue from his own books, seminars, and consulting fees, with total earnings likely surpassing **$5 million** over the years.

# Eugene Schwartz authored the legendary breakthrough advertising

* **Boardroom Inc.**: Schwartz worked on some of the best-known direct-response campaigns for Boardroom’s health and financial products.
* **Rodale**, one of his clients, was able to sell millions of books using the copy he wrote for them. He wrote one ad that sold 1.98 million copies of a single $25 book. That's $50 million!
* **Maxwell House**: He created highly successful advertising campaigns for Maxwell House coffee.
* Schwartz earned **$50,000 to $100,000 per project** in the 1960s and 1970s, which was a substantial amount at the time. Adjusted for inflation, this would be the equivalent of **$400,000 to $800,000 today**. Some of his most successful campaigns, like those for Boardroom Inc., generated millions in revenue. It’s estimated that Schwartz made **millions of dollars** from royalties and commissions across his career.
* While i couldn't figure out his exact net-worth, Schwarts had his own mail order firm called ""instant improvements"", even has a book to go along with it and the company was evaluted to be in the multiple millions.

# David Ogilvy (my personal favorite)

* **Hathaway Shirts**: Ogilvy’s famous ad for Hathaway Shirts featuring a distinguished man with an eye patch was a game-changer, contributing significantly to the brand's success.
* **Guinness**: Ogilvy created iconic advertisements for Guinness beer, building the brand’s image for decades.
* **American Express**: Ogilvy worked on campaigns that transformed American Express into one of the most prestigious financial brands in the world.
* Ogilvy’s agency, **Ogilvy & Mather**, was valued in the **hundreds of millions of dollars**, and Ogilvy personally made **millions** from his agency’s success. His book *Confessions of an Advertising Man* was a bestseller and continued to generate revenue. His financial success was tied to his ownership of the agency and its lucrative contracts, leading to a net worth of around **$50–100 million** at his peak. Ive read elsewhere that at the time of his death it was bought out for as much $864 million as In 1989, WPP Group, a British advertising holding company, acquired Ogilvy Group.
* He also lived in castle in france towards the end of his career

Special mention to all the other great copywriters that I didn't mention for the sake of brevity like claude hopkins, Joe karbo, Robert Collier, etc. The entire point of this post is to highlight how having your own assets in addition to meaningful client work can make you unlimited earnings. Many if not most of these copywriter often rejected million dollars client budgets because they were in that much abundancy.

That's what I want for everyone reading this, to build your own info-product business and make the clients beg for you, not the other way around.

You do this by leaning into marketing and understanding the market first. But often times copywriters reject any sort of marketing, any sort of social proofing, portfolio building or even the info-product space.

I was just reading on the main copywriting subreddit how some junior copywriter wasted *an entire month* doing all sorts of tasks for a client only to get paid $400 dollars. Are you kidding me? 

Imagine instead being in a position where that client is at minimum paying like $4,000 and being in a position to reject them because other clients are begging for you.

I didn't even mention contemporary and living copywriting legends like Ben Settle and Matt Furey. These two write a daily email and sell to their lists of 40-50k email subscribers. 

It only takes them about 10 minutes to write that copy and send it out, in addition they both have a subscription based print newsletter thats designed for their more private readers.

Settle charges $100 per person on his personal print newsletter called ""Email players"" which he launched like 10 years ago. Now do the math on a small conversion of about 2-5% on that. 2% of 50,000 is 1,000. Now multiply 1,000 times $100(his subscription price). Thats $100,000 per month minimum, with just the list alone!

Lets assume you personally have 220 people on your list and charge a more modest $39. thats 8580 per month and just over 6 figures per year. A practical, low effort, high leverage way to hit that mythical 6 figures going around everywhere.

Do you see now the value of building your own list and marketing? Because sorry to tell you, the OG classic and living copywriters aren't doing endless, cheap work for clients, they're building their own agencies, selling their own offers, subscriptions, holding seminar for like 10-20K per pop, etc.

I don't know about you, but I know which path I want to take.

I am really feeling a anxious about hurting her feelings, especially because I am a friend of the family. We never held hands or kissed or anything. It's literally just been coffee and dinner so far.

1hsrlzf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hsrlzf,My ESA dog won't eat his kibble! Previous owner told me he eats kibble and isn't picky! But I offer him kibble 2x a day and he hasn't touched his meals AT ALL for like 2 days! ,"Hi everybody! Backstory/context:  So I suffer from major depression, GAD, PTSD and ADHD. So I needed a support animal and went on Adopt A Pet, an online platform that connects people putting their animals up for adoption or rehoming, and people looking to adopt. I applied for an adorable smaller pup who's a Labrador/mixed breed, about 25 lbs. His previous owners loved him but had just had a baby, so the man felt that the dog wasn't getting enough attention and wanted to rehome him somewhere where he'd get one on one attention and affection. I got him approved via Support Pets, and by the way speaking of that (disclaimer/warning), obviously I'm coming on here and posting this because I'd like support and positive feedback with this problem I'm having. Instead, last time I came on Reddit with a problem about the housing regulations regarding ESAs, I got awful responses from people who had apparently looked up my posting history and told me, in so many words, that I'm the problem, one guy told me something to the effect of if I smell sh*t everywhere I go, maybe I should check my shoes. Hilarious. Another person who seemingly had also trolled my previous post told me ""I sound like a total nightmare"" and proceeded to tell me why I was in the wrong, like the first commenter I mentioned, through shaming me based on their interpretation of things I've posted. Oddly enough, the one person who didn't resort to insults or name calling still gave me wrong information, basically saying FHA doesn't apply in sublet housing which apparently is not the case because my dog was ESA approved and my landlord has allowed him to move in without charging me a pet deposit or any extra fees. All I'm asking in this specific post is: be a damn adult and if you have something productive to say , please feel free to comment but if you just feel like trashing me and telling me what an awful inconsiderate obnoxious person you think I am, there's ample opportunity to do that elsewhere on the web, not that I approve of that but I know a trolls gonna troll. Nonetheless I PROMISE you you don't know me, not enough to determine I shouldn't have a dog or whether I'm a total nightmare who deserves whatever negativity I get. I know that was a lengthy side note but I simply want to tell you that since you're strangers, since Reddit is supposed to be anonymous, all I'm asking for is the respect that I show everyone else on this platform; but I will absolutely lash back at someone if I feel unjustly attacked. 
Here, finally, is the main point: I've had my ESA dog, who's name is Milo, since December 26th. Since I got him from a previous owner who had had him for years, I assumed that he would bring Milo with a starter kit of the remainder of his food (I mean what else does he need dog food for without a dog and doesn't that make a lot more sense than throwing it away?) And also I admit, I assumed he'd bring his toys, maybe his bowls, but in the end he just brought Milo, his crate, which I said ""sure"" to just in case, and obviously his collar and a retractable leash so old and worn that the retractable part didn't work anymore, so I went to Petsmart and got him food/water bowls, kibble (since the owner didn't bring his food, wouldn't give me the name of the food he was used to and liked), and a few toys (again based on what the owner had told me the dog liked: tennis balls, chewy bones, and I got one of those knotted rope toys with which you can play tug of war with your dog). All of the toys he basically doesn't touch. I take him for about an hour walk everyday, sometimes more, so he gets lots of exercise. But he is consistently refusing his food. First, when he got here I assumed he was sort of in shock and massive anxiety and confusion (which is the main reason I think it would have helped for him to have his familiar things to ease the transition). For the first few days I was guilty of adding a little cut up turkey dog, a few spoonfuls of rice with chicken broth, etc. to the kibble to entice him and he did eat it then. But I weaned off of that because I don't want to foster picky or demanding eating habits in him, he should really just eat his kibble twice a day and if he behaves well he gets little treats here and there and of course water is always available to him. 
I was just wondering though...does anyone else have a similar experience because I've been assured that a sort of difficult transition period is typical when a dog is rehomed and has to adjust to a whole new set of circumstances.  I also consulted ChatGPT and learned a helpful tip, which was don't leave the food just out all day, because then that encourages him to be picky and lessons his gratefulness for meals. So I give him a 30 minute window to eat, once in the morning while I have breakfast and my coffee, and once in the evening when I eat my dinner.  But it us really hard doing this tough love approach, and if anyone could offer, again, positive feedback or advice that is related to this issue of dogs not eating and basically just acting strange while they're going through this whole overwhelming rehoming process, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I have stayed there in the past and had a great experience. I generally pass through Vegas either for work or as a jump off to a road trip.  It is great for both of those purposes (and super convenient to the airport). The rooms are comfortable and clean. The coffee and food options are good.  
  
HOWEVER, I just stayed there this week and it was terrible. The culinary workers union has been on strike since November.  As a guest booking a room online, I had no idea.  I would not have stayed there in the first place had I known that the hotel was unwilling to pay its workers a fair living wage.  
  
That said, when we rolled up in the rental car at midnight after a long day of travel from the east coast, we had no other option than to check in.  I am assuming that the strike is impacting the rest of the staff at the hotel. My check in experience was negative (employee just seemed exhausted and over it).  I did not sleep at all because the striking workers were yelling and playing loud music all night.  Even on the 10th floor, it was quite loud.  I never fell fully asleep because every few minutes, someone would scream through a bullhorn. And before dawn, the din of the protest was drowned out by the roar of planes overhead. Strangely in the past I did not hear planes, maybe this is has something to with which tower you are in? This time it was the Canyon Tower.  
  
There are currently no food options in the hotel due to the strike. We basically rolled out of the hotel as early as possible in the morning, driving on to our next stop feeing exhausted and miserable.  We agreed that we would have had a comparable experience just sleeping in the rental car versus staying at this hotel.

I get the intention of the protest is to deter business (and I support that strategy). The problem is that if you're not a local and you're booking this hotel online, you would have no idea what you're really about to experience.

The episode start's with SMG4 on his computer doing meme's(pc shows a Sonic vs Shadow but Meme version), until....he felt something's wrong, Mario as always was supposed to be in his room to mess with with him, but he's not there, so SMG4 just think it's all in his head and continues to do memes, but now he start's to feel lonely, the next scene show's meggy, tari, and saiko playing with the instruments, until they felt something's wrong, they were expecting Mario to mess with there music stuff....but he's not there, they ignored it but.....they felt Lonely. the next scene shows the SMG4 crew in a meeting talking about where is Mario, everyone starts talking that they don't know and they felt very lonely, except SMG3 cause he's busy today at his coffee shop and just leaves, then the crew goes and ask Luigi about being lonely....Luigi begins to sweat and says ""oh, he's just at home eating spaghetti, that's all"", the smg4 crew then just wait until mario can come to the SMG4 house to hang out, Luigi walked out off the SMG4 house and called someone, it was revealed that Mario was on vacation with Swag, Karen and her kids to Super Nintendo World, Mario was kind of very disappointed with Luigi cause Luigi slept in for a long time, flashback: Mario got up at 5am, due to the flight being at 7am, Mario tried to wake up Luigi buuuut Luigi was way to asleep, so Mario said ""F$%k it"", and just went with Swag, Karen and her kids cause there also going to Super Nintendo World for vacation.

So, you’re staring at the ceiling, counting sheep, and contemplating your life choices. Sleep? Not happening. 

Don’t worry—here are 10 quirky, unexpected, and downright strange ways to trick your brain into hitting snooze-ville.

# 1. Pretend You’re Not Trying to Sleep 🕶️

Reverse psychology works on toddlers, so why not on yourself? Tell your brain, “We’re staying up ALL night.” Suddenly, you’ll find yourself dozing off like a rebellious teenager during a boring lecture.

# 2. The Blanket Ballet 🩰

Tired of tossing and turning? Turn it into a performance art piece. Flop like a starfish, pirouette under the covers, or just burrito yourself and call it interpretive dance. Sleep will follow out of sheer exhaustion.

# 3. Create a Ridiculous Storyline in Your Head 📖

Invent a bizarre, soap-opera-worthy plot. Maybe you’re a detective investigating why your cat knocked over your coffee. By the time you solve it (spoiler: your cat’s just a jerk), you’ll be snoring.

# 4. Count Backwards from 1,073 🧮

Forget counting sheep; that’s basic. Instead, count backwards from a super random number like 1,073. By the time you reach 1, your brain will be so bored, it’ll give up and let you sleep.

# 5. Play “Who Can Lie Still the Longest?” 🤐

Challenge yourself to freeze like a statue. No fidgeting, no scratching, no peeking at your phone. Sleep tends to sneak up when you’re pretending to be lifeless.

# 6. Listen to the World’s Most Boring Podcast 🎧

Find a monotone narrator droning on about something you don’t care about (medieval farming techniques, anyone?). Before you know it, you’ll be in a medieval dreamland, plowing fields with a donkey.

# 7. Imagine You’re in a Cozy Scene 🏞️

Picture yourself inside a warm cabin, wrapped in a blanket, sipping hot chocolate while a storm rages outside. Feel the imaginary warmth, hear the crackling fire… BAM, dreamland.

# 8. Stare at the Ceiling and Blink Slowly 👀

Instead of closing your eyes, keep them open but blink as if you’re moving in slow motion. Your eyelids will eventually get so heavy, they’ll close on their own. Science? Not sure, but it works.

# 9. Try the Alphabet of Gratitude 🅰️➡️🆉

Think of something you’re grateful for, starting with each letter of the alphabet. A: Apples. B: Blankets. C: Chocolate. Somewhere around “Xylophones,” you’ll be dreaming.

# 10. Sleep in a Weird Spot 🛋️

Sometimes your bed is the problem. Try the couch, the floor, or even the bathtub (but maybe without water). The novelty might trick your brain into shutting off.

✨ **Pro Tip:** The key to beating insomnia is creativity. If all else fails, just accept your new title as Night Owl Supreme and embrace the 2 AM snacks. 🦉

I planted these around November, and they’ve now reached the flowering stage. I was hoping to get some feedback on how they’re doing and if there’s anything I should adjust to help them thrive.

A few details:
- Health Issues: I’ve had to trim some branches in the past due to yellow/black spots, which I think were fungal issues.
- Pruning: I try to prune them regularly, but I’m still unsure if my tomatoes are determinate or indeterminate.
- Fertilizer: I haven’t used any fertilizer yet, but I’m considering adding crushed eggshells and coffee grounds to the soil to increase acidity and provide phosphorus.
- Location: I’m in Argentina, and it’s summer here. Daytime temperatures are usually around 30ºC (86ºF).

","I (34M) had been dating my now ex-girlfriend (29F) for two years. A few months ago, she moved into my home with my cat, Muffin, who’s been my quiet, loyal companion for seven years. Muffin is the type of cat that minds her business, loves her routines, and has always been a calm, low-maintenance presence in my life.

Things started going downhill when my girlfriend decided to teach Muffin to “talk” using those soundboards with buttons. I wasn’t thrilled about the idea, but I agreed to let her try it. At first, it was harmless. Muffin learned “food” and “treat,” and it was mildly amusing. But my girlfriend couldn’t stop there. She bought more buttons and programmed phrases like “bored,” “outside,” “play now,” and even “no.” Muffin quickly learned how to press these buttons—constantly.

Within weeks, my home was chaos. Muffin now wakes me up at all hours with “hungry,” spams “play now” when I’m working, and even taunts me with “no” when I try to get her to stop misbehaving. I tried to explain to my girlfriend that Muffin’s behavior was becoming stressful and disruptive, but she dismissed me, claiming that Muffin was “happier than ever” and that I should appreciate her “new voice.”

The final straw was during the holidays when her mother came to stay with us—along with their family dog, Max. Her mom, it turns out, has her own unique approach to training animals. She had taught Max how to open cabinets and “steal” food on command as a party trick. The first time I saw Max snagging a loaf of bread off my counter while my girlfriend and her mom laughed, I was stunned. I asked them to stop encouraging him, but they brushed me off, saying, “It’s just for fun.”

Over the week, Max raided my pantry twice, once destroying an expensive bag of coffee beans. When I expressed my frustration, her mother said, “You’re overreacting; it’s just food.” I tried to set boundaries, asking her to keep Max out of the kitchen, but instead of respecting my wishes, they doubled down, turning it into a joke. Meanwhile, Muffin kept up her button-mashing antics, creating a non-stop cacophony of “hungry, bored, play now.”

One night, after I found Muffin pressing “bored” repeatedly at 2 AM while Max was noisily trying to break into the trash, I realized I couldn’t live like this anymore. I sat my girlfriend down and explained that this wasn’t working for me. I told her I loved her, but I felt like she and her family had completely disregarded my needs, my home, and my relationship with Muffin. She called me uptight, said I didn’t understand the joy of “letting animals live their best lives,” and accused me of being controlling.

That was it for me. I told her to pack her things and leave. She moved out a few days later, and I’ve since removed all the talking buttons. Muffin has returned to her peaceful self, and I’ve changed the locks to ensure I won’t be dealing with Max’s antics again.

My friends are split on whether I was too harsh. Some think I overreacted and should’ve compromised, while others say I was justified for wanting to protect my home and sanity. So, AITAH?",6,1735923840.0,AITAH,8,0.65,False
1hsr7od,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1hsr7od/final_person_is_gone/,Final person is gone,"Hey everybody thanks for letting me share. 

History: mom has psychosis/schizoid-type borderline personality. Flat affect. Beat me when little. Thought would die as toddler. Locked up in dark apartment. Windows closed up. She’s lie in bed dying. Always severely sick anorexic possible drugs. At 4 years old I’d measure her medication and bring it to her. Nothing in fridge. Thought I’d starve to death. Not allowed outside, also baby didn’t understand. Would watch Tv 24/7. Total isolation. Don’t know night from day. Sleep all day. Up all night. Mother would beat me. Tell me she didn’t love me and wished I was never born. Hard to hear at my age, but 5 and under especially hard. 

No one ever came to save me. Except when kindergarten began and the state noticed I should be in school. Then the truancy officer would come 3-4 times a year. My mom would do the bare minimum to not be arrested or have me taken away in custody.

Stole a cookie at lunch first grade. Was written up. No cares if I was hungry. 
Mother never filled out school paperwork for free lunch. And wouldn’t give me lunch. Again no one cared. This went on all the way through high school.

Grandmother is grandiose/malignant narcissist type. Hates anyone pretty on TV anything, any sort of happiness or beauty. Despises it. Hates compassion. Taught me Machiavellian values. You don’t need people. People are to be used. Her favorite story to share is destroying the career of the pretty pastors wife, she was head secretary at a school. Her eldest daughter, my aunt was gorgeous, and driven to suicide at 17. Beautiful. That’s not a coincidence in my mind. Her death is when my mother had a psychotic break. My grandmother trashed my mother about everything her weight, her black tooth she got when she was like 8, my grandmother refused to fix. 
She tears everyone apart for everything. How long you take a shower, how much food you eat, why are you smiling. My mother doesn’t have compassion and ask why are you happy too. 

Neighbors would call the cops frequently for animal abuse to my grandmothers little tiny dog. Keeping outside in Michigan winter all day. My mother would buy small animals and then let them die of neglect or kill them to be spiteful/control.

Never knew dad. Met once. Died of lung cancer age 30 from lifetime of drugs.

My sisters didn’t have it quite as bad and want the families approval. So they’re focused on themselves and their own victim-hood. Do not have compassion and integrity. 

I’ve always struggled to make friends. Can meet people. But then real connection been impossible. Either I’m fake, covering everything up, an angry jerk, have used them, or a lot of the time they’re drawn to my low self esteem, I attract abusers. 

Met my ex in high school. Creep asshole. My grandmother pushed me to marry him right after high school graduation because “you need somewhere to live.”

Early years my mother married the neighbor next door, who preyed on me. I was 5. They’d have sex in the open. I ended up being molested. He went to prison. Then when he was released my mother told me it never happened. Got back with and had my sisters. If I ran into him and went into shock cried. She asked what’s wrong. Was sickening. 

Lived with my grandmother during high school. Every day she reminded me what a martyr she was for letting me sleep on the couch. Eat her food. What a saint she was. Her and my grandfather would put me through sleep deprivation. Keeping the TV on until 1am talking, loud, parties, then at 6 am my grandfather would turn all the lights on and run the coffee grinder.
She wanted me there to spite my mother, I’ve got your kid and to talk about how wonderful she is. 

Talked me into cutting off all my hair because I was getting compliments, pushed me to go by another name to be cruel to my mother, any project I did well she tell me, whatever, who cares, you didn’t even try. Would talk to a cousin or someone and then turn and walk away pretending I didn’t exist. Oh, I didn’t see you. Refused to let me say hi to my grandfather. To be weird, controlling and hurtful.

I became exceptional at masking. It was the expectation. I don’t know what normal was. And no one in the world ever cared anyway. 
And a lot of the isolation. Continual harshness. No food. Sleep. Nightmares every night, my whole life. 
Felt surreal, not real.

At 27 I got a good job and felt independent enough to get divorced. Struggled to make it happen. Hard to do things not only alone, but with others fighting drag you down. Did it. Ex is covert narcissist. Got me to agree to let him stay a few months, pay rent my new place while he looked for somewhere to go. I needed the money and agreed. He stayed 3 years. It was hell, like my marriage. Angry hostile person who played nice to everyone else. 

But met nice man who hired me at an accounting firm. He encouraged and helped me in a real way. Get free of the condo and my ex once and for all. 

We developed a strong emotional attachment. And truly a loving relationship. I learned what it meant to be happy for the first time. Learned what compassion and kindness are. Learned it’s possible to love another person. But while he loved me. He never chose me. I was always second. He’d promise I’m going leave my wife and marry you, I’m going to buy us a house, plan building our dream home, buy the golf cart, take the trips, buy the ring. And it was all leading. None of it was true. 
I knew it, would call him out on it. But couldn’t help but hope it would change. It never changed. 
He’s more worried about his image and his place in the world and what his family would think of him than he wants to be happy or treated well. His wife is cold self centered. Hates poor people, can’t understand why they walk on her beach, etc. calls my friend cruel names. Is not. Nice person. 
My partner won’t choose to walk away. Will stay the victim. Because the “life”.

But he’s also wanted me. The commitment, love, loyalty, support, genuine friendship, touch, and connection. 

So he’s been paying for all my bills and buying me whatever I like, to a point. So that I don’t work, am not out in the world, am his. 
And whenever I’d talk about starting a business. He’d run me in circles, until the project was too complicated to go forward.

Now I’ve spent years doing nothing. Severe adhd and anger/ptsd, antisocial tendencies before. My resume wasn’t great from my twenties to begin with. Now I have no references or history to put down. 

Except for references I can ask him to write or help me get. He would, but it puts the ball back in his court. 

He’s not a bad guy. But I need to be free. I need my own life. A business of my own. To own a home. Be financially independent. Feel safe, secure, connected. 

I can’t work for other people. I have to be in a position where I’m in charge. It’s the only way I’m calm enough to get by. Emotionally manipulative or simply jerky coworkers, affect me too strongly and it doesn’t end well. 

When I was married I fought to get a small dog and she’s been my whole world. Always there for me. Has greater emotional capacity, critical thinking skills and empathy than most people do. She’s a little person. And my baby. I won’t leave her. 

So wherever I work has to be with her. 

I like people and have practiced decades talking to people. I’m very good at it. And no one ever knows I have problems. 
Even almost died in a 40-foot tsunami wave and the next day. So many people were like wow, but you seem so calm and happy. When really on the inside my heart goes up to 150. 

That’s where I’m at. I have no one in life. No mother/father/family. No friends. No social circle. 
No resources. No support. 

My boyfriend and I broke up today after 5 years, going on 6. Because I know my life can’t continue this way. I deserve a happy healthy life. A future. To be valued. 

But I don’t necessarily trust or like anyone.
And I still don’t recognize when people are happy. 

I’ve tried multiple therapist, but either they treat me like gossip, use me, or scam, are dark, have problems of their own, or are clueless don’t get it. 
So therapy is not an option. I’ve given it a very thorough try over decades. 

Practically speaking. If you all needed to work for yourself, find a new town to live. Where would you begin? 

How do you start a life when you don’t have one?

What’s the best plan to keep me safe?

My dream is to own a farm. At one time I wanted to be a vet. I’m good at stocks, could go for money manager. 
But all of those take money, confidence, basic human connection. And all I can think about is this break up and how much it hurts.

I’m in so much pain. 

To top it off someone hurt my dog a couple months ago and now she’s injured and sore every day, is 10 years old. If I lose her. Honestly, I don’t really want to make it, or try. 

I’m so lost. 

Any kind words would be very much appreciated. 

Again thanks for letting me share.

1hsr66u,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1hsr66u/does_anyone_else_struggle_because_of_seeing/,Does anyone else struggle because of seeing everything as a task? ,"Even though I (26F) don't think I'm living an unhappy life, it seems like my happiness is significantly decreased compared to my non-INTJ friends, mostly because of my ""ability"" to turn the smallest possible thing into a task or a project. Usually when my friends have a free day (meaning no events, no special tasks on to-do list, only basic adult chores to do) they end the day feeling refreshed and recharged, but in my case, I feel like I've just been as busy as usual. It goes more or less like this: 

* even on a free day I still have to eat -> adding meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking to my to-do list
* I will surely spend money on groceries, coffee on the way, etc. -> adding ""input my expenses in a budget planner"" to my to-do list
* the same will happen with other chores like doing laundry, organizing my space, filling out/checking my calendar for the following days

So already after considering these chores that usually seem really small to other people, I already feel slightly overwhelmed with having so many tasks to do on my free day. But the worst thing is when I'm trying to do something for fun/to relax. 

* a new episode of a tv show I watch comes out today? perfect, now it becomes a task in my mind to finish watching that episode (thus I don't even know if I'm enjoying it, because from that point on my mind is only focused on finishing a task of watching that specific episode)
* maybe I will just watch Youtube then, the shorter format might be helpful? WRONG, then it becomes a project to clean up videos on my ""To-watch"" list, refresh my playlists or go through the accounts I follow (the same happens with Spotify, Instagram, Tik Tok, etc.)
* reading a book? perfect, now I have a task of reading one chapter on my to-do list :)))) 
* so maybe I will just write back to my friends?? yesss, a well known project of keeping a social circle alive, how could I be relaxed with such an important task on hand

And truly, no matter what I decide to do to relax that day, it just seems like instead of doing nothing, I'm drowning in multiple tasks and projects - even with things that are well known to help with recharging like going on a walk, working out, going to a nice coffee shop etc. And when I'm to tired to take on the ""relaxation day responsibilities"" I just end up doom-scrolling and eating junk food, so it doesn't exactly make me happy either. It's honestly my dream at this point is to feel refreshed after a free day and because it gives me an even smaller mental space for days when I actually have a lot to do, it has become quite problematic. And if I didn't talk to my friends about this, I would probably live my life thinking that that's just the fate of the adult life, but coming from how they were shocked to hear that, I'm pretty sure it's not. Does anyone struggle with the same pattern?? Or better, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this issue? ",5,1735923737.0,intj,2,1.0,False

Not proud of this one, throwaway for the incoming hate. 

Known this woman for 8-9 years through work. She moved jobs, still nearby my office. We got on well at work and kept in touch when she left, often meeting for lunch for catchups, I saw her regularly. Genuinlely not sure how it progressed the way it did but to cut a long story short, it turned into an affair. Was probably an emotional affair for longer than I realise, then about a year and a half, 2 years physical. At the time it felt like we were just having fun, until she told me she had feelings, she was in love, I made her realise she wasnt as happy with her husband as she thought she was. she wished she had my kids and not her husbands etc, it was a really deep, dark time. 
She never really mentioned her husband so as shitty as this is to say, in the heat of it, he wasnt much of a thought. 

Told her we should probably cut ties and give her marriage a chance without me in the picture at all. We tried, but she pleaded with me to not block her number, and she knew where I work, socials, everything, she would be able to get back in contact if she really wanted anyway so I agreed. We went probably 7-8 months at the longest without being in contact. Then a month or 2 a handfull of times. And a few weeks loads of times. Near constant contact inbetween these bouts. 
She’s always the one to reach out first. She always carries the conversation as much as she can. If I take a day or so to reply, she will send follow up texts. 
 Swears things are better in the marriage, but now wants to keep our friendship going and tells me that shes over everything that went on. 

I get the impression she isnt over it. 

Shes sending morning and night texts. 
Flirting. A few times she’s brought up things we had done during sex, which leaned into her sending 'spicier' texts, which I believe would have went further if I hadnt changed the subject. In the past few weeks she has also taken to sending me pictures of her hair when shes had it done. Showing me her nails. What she wore for christmas and new year etc. 
I think she also still has all our old texts aswell and may look back on them frequently. Several times she’s brought up exact dates of things I was doing when we were involved, or things Ive said. Like minor little things I cant even remember, she comes out with exact dates of. And I know some people have great memory like that,
and I dont mean this in a horrible way, but she aint one of those people. 
Ultra ditsy blond type. 
No offence to any blondes potentially reading this. 

She’s also mentioned meeting up for a coffee soon. We havent seen each other face to face in about 2 years. Not sure its a great idea. 
For someone to say they have as deep feelings as she has said she had, and the way she’s been acting, I dont think staying in contact is going to ease any of this, its only going to ramp up again, right? 
Im pretty sure she still has some deep feelings there that she’s maybe not admitting herself. 
Ive thought about just going no contact, but I guess over the years Ive also grown somewhat attached and struggle with the thought of cutting someone Ive shared so much time with, and achieved so much with, both personally and professionaly and blocking them from everything. 

Never thought I’d be one of those people but here I am. 
I feel horrible that her husband is oblivious to all of this, but if anyone should be telling him, its her. 
This has drastically changed how I feel about relationships to be honest. 
Pretty depressing. 
Definetely played on my mental health. 

So I guess Im posting this hopefull for validation that will motivate me to do what should have been done years ago. 
I’d like to hear opinions on if I should tell her first or just block, block, block. 
I know she will try and talk me out of it, but how do I just erase someone whose meant as much to me, from my life? 
How do I do this?

I used to have a very close friend once, his name was Greg, and he was my friend from 2019 up until 2024. 5 years of friendship. And the only reason why it went on for so long was because I kept on reaching out to him even after he would ignore me (sobrang stupid ko lang to do this for myself).

Natatawa parin ako. He was always so promising. Sobrang green flag. Sobrang best friends. Until one time hindi ko siya pinapansin because busy ako makipag usap sa ibang guys. I don’t find him physically attractive at all, so the notion of us being together is absolutely not in any of my plans. Then eventually he ignored me. I kept on messaging him and he kept on ignoring me. Eventually he told me that he wanted to end the friendship kasi may mga new friends na ako (tanga lang?) lmao. I told him need ko pa siya sa buhay ko (I did not know Reddit back then and hirap ako maghanap nang friends talaga) and tiniis ko lahat nang pang go ghost niya. Then bigla ulit ako tinamad mag reply, so nag iignore ulit (diring diri ako sa sarili ko bakit pinilit ko mag update sa kanya at iforce sarili ko na mag update sa kanya just to keep the friendship). Eventually nagkabalikan kami as friends. Nililibre ko na siya nang pagkain just so he won’t ignore me. Sinabi ko once, before I cut him off completely, na “look at this afam, my family wants me to be with this man” (ang gwapo nang afam and he was so excited to meet me. Unfortunately wala akong self confidence to meet him so I backed out sa takot that he would reject me) and eventually he ignored me. 

He ensured that my messages were getting delivered all the time and whenever I post a facebook story, he would seenzone it. Nasanay ata na ako naghahabol. Never again. And then all those pent up anger just blew. And then I cut him off forever. Kala naman niya kung sino siya. 

Also the guy, J, he was my situationship that 2023. Message nang message sa akin kapag di nireplyan nang gf niya. Nung namatay yung dog ko at sobrang sakit nang heart ko kakainom nang alak at coffee (I was alcoholic back then but now I have changed), bigla ba namang sinabi na busy daw siya. Alam na niyang namatayan ako nang aso. Then he posted a story of his girlfriend. Fast forward January 3, 2025, nag memessage na naman. Ayun, blocked. 

Right now, I only have Vince, (the one I met dito sa Reddit), Van and Shaiy. They are my only constants and they respect and appreciate my existence. I have never felt this much peace and happiness in my life. 

Also, thank you Reddit kasi nakahanap ako nang kaibigan dito. Anyway, remember to cut off the people who hurt you. Pag hirap maghanap nang friends, go lang, hanap lang dito sa Reddit. Pray to have a good one and hopefully you can find a good one (I prayed for one). Yun lang. You deserve the kind of peace and appreciation that makes you happy.

Family is a cornerstone of my life, and I believe in living healthy and making the most of every moment.

1hsr39c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hsr39c/how_to_make_a_good_friend_a_casual_friend/,How to make a good friend a casual friend,"My (30F) friend Sophie (29F) has changed a lot since I met her, and lately I've been trying to figure out a way to stay casual friends with her without cutting her off completely.

I met Sophie in 2017, after I moved to a new city, and she was one of my first friends in that city that really stuck. She and I got on well - we hung out a lot at coffee shops, museums, and just had really great conversations! She became one of my best friends. When I became really depressed in a job thanks to an abusive manager, she helped me at her company by giving me a referral - and I did end up getting and taking that job, so then we became coworkers. We had so much fun and we shared things with each other that made me feel like we were close friends. I loved her so much, I asked her to be my bridesmaid for my wedding.

The pandemic and the first guy she started seriously dating (her now-husband) really changed her. I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but sometime between then and now Sophie changed from a city-loving, friendly girl to a girl who became overly fixated on money and crime, and closed-off and judgmental of experiences that don't involve her own personal viewpoints that stem from her religion and politics.

Here are some details about how I have been feeling based on my more recent experiences with her:  
\- Even though our weddings were 8 months apart, she didn't put me in her wedding party. My heart really broke when she broke the news, though I never let her see that. I walked away from our breakfast where she told me, crying. I know there's no obligation to reciprocate wedding parties, but having it done so closely to my own wedding, and having her offer no empathy or acknowledgement of how I might be feeling, was really tough. Later, she invited me to play a small role in the wedding, so got to participate in some pre-wedding things for her, but not being a part of the main group was tough.  
\- Her closest friends (who she did put in her wedding party) have cut her off, saying that her values have completely changed and no longer align with what they define as a good person. They also said she's insufferable to be around and selfish.   
\- I went to grad school, as did my husband and sister, and she knows this. Yet at a recent dinner, she made a comment that she's so glad she didn't do grad school and ""chose to be rich instead."" This was so shocking to me I couldn't think of a good way to respond in the moment.  
\- I'm now living in a different city, and I feel she doesn't prioritize our time together when I visit. While she does make time to see me, it has become a pattern where she arrives late and dashes early from our dinners. She claims she does so, in order to catch a train from downtown to the suburbs as there is a long commute (1.5 hours) and to get back to her 4 month old baby, so I understand this but I always feel really embarrassed leaving from dinner alone.  
\- I recognize that we are in different stages of life and now firmly in different classes (she and her husband make way more than me and mine, with a house and a baby). It's hard that she doesn't seem to realize how talking about how much money they make is gauche, or that every time she does this I change the subject. Everything is wonderful in her life, she talks about how her baby is the easiest baby ever and ""isn't it just so wonderful to be in love."" (I love my husband but I wouldn't ever say this?) It can be tough to be so happy for her when my life isn't as easy. When I share problems with her like the good old days when we would be vulnerable with each other, she takes an attitude of pity and suggests things that are financially out of reach for me - which she is aware of, because I tell her every time.  
\- I don't like her husband. Her husband is, as half his wedding party and family members reiterated at the rehearsal dinner, ""an asshole."" This was supposed to be funny (I guess?), but you can only say things so many times before it just sounds bad. He is arrogant and frankly he's been a jerk to me and many of her other friends many times, Sophie has never said anything to him about his behavior. I think it says a lot about a person based on who they partner with.  
\- This is small and maybe stupid, but she uses ""civilized"" to describe things she likes, such as working remotely 3x a week. There's something about this that really bothers me.

I'm now living in a different city, and this past year we saw each other just once in person. But she tries to talk to me on the phone at least once a month. 

I don't want to cut her off like some of her other friends, because in spite of what I listed above, I still find value in the relationship. For me, it's hard to give up on a friend, especially when I really love(d) them. I am also very aware of how difficult it is to make *new* friends. Add the added potential hurt of not talking to someone anymore who appears in my wedding photos, is tough.

My boyfriend asked me a few nights ago what's going on. We generally pride ourselves on open and honest communication but I've been going through a lot the last few days with the holidays. He could tell something was on my mind but I didn't want to talk about it and I told him that.

He pressed a little bit and things just started coming out of my mouth. I told him it wasn't his business what I was thinking about, that he asks me so many questions it gets overwhelming, that his need to talk every day is exhausting and he asks me to do too much for him, that he's not my whole life and I don't owe him anything. I meant all of it but not as severely as it came out. He nodded along and I could tell he was listening and hurt but he didn't say anything. He went on his phone after the conversation without saying anything. I went to bed about 5 hours later and he didnt even move. 

When I woke up in the morning he was still on his phone and I could tell he didn't sleep. I asked him if he slept and got a ""yeah"". I brought up something about his hobbies and got a ""pretty crazy"" in return. He normally asks me to make him a coffee in the morning when I make myself one and he didn't. I asked if he wanted one and he said ""not asking you for anything"". He never looked away from his phone except to kiss me goodbye.

I came home and had a shower. He got home while I was showering and went to sleep. He got up after I fell asleep and went for a drive, didn't come back til the morning. He laid in bed and didn't know I was awake. As soon as I moved he pretended to be sleeping and I called him on it. I asked him what was going on and he just said ""not stepping into this mine field"". I asked him what that meant and he just said ""why, so you can tell me how much of a chore I am? Just worry about yourself"" And left for work. 

Now he's at work and I've called out of work because I'm so upset. I feel like I screwed up everything irrevocably and hurt him badly and I feel like I deserve what's happening right now. I've never seen him like this before, not even angry just completely apathetic. I checked our car's location history and he just parked near a lake for 5 hours and came back home. I don't know what any of this means and I just feel like a total piece of shit.",3,1735923485.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

So I started a new protocol on New Years. Wasn't even a resolution, just sort of lined up this way because I have a big event in May and I wasn't very mindful with my ongoing weightloss over the holidays (I lost 60 lbs since February, but gained back about 20). 

Anyway, back to it. I'm done with my first 72 hrs tomorrow morning. I wanted to see your opinions on this schedule:

- 1x 72h water/blk coffee fast a week
- 2x cross training
- 2x 3+ mile run/walk
- 4 day re-feed: balanced but low carb

Planning on doing this for 2 months (+/- depending on how my body adapts) and then switching to 48s with Keto and one meal re-feed. 

I am trying to kick about 50lbs. I know that's a steep goal and I'm not married to that number, but I want to try. 

Do you have any pointers how to maximize weightloss? 

I know staying in Keto on re-feeds really helps, but I have to ramp up to that. I'm not ready to sustain that yet.

Last week I did 12mg and still had decent suppression and this week I did 10mg and am noticing some food noise coming back (I'm also on my period so idk if that's why) I heard somewhere that if you increase your dose you can't go back down? Is that true? I also may or may not experience some sort of general tachyphylaxis to medications. I very rapidly desensitize and resensitize to medications like Benadryl, caffeine etc. One cup of coffee consumed in the morning after not drinking any for a while will literally keep me up all night but after a few days of consumption I can have three cups throughout the day and sleep like a baby at night. Then it just takes a few days to reset the tolerance back to zero. Same with Benadryl, night 1 knocks me out, sleep like the dead. A few days in I can take two pills and barely feel tired. Wondering if it's similar with tirz and I could potentially reset my tolerance to go down to an effective lower dose since I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to buy compounded again since it’s going off the shortage list.

Hello.

I am of course aware that you can't say that for sure, but I would still like to get the opinion of the hivemind because I have zero dating experience myself. So the situation is as follows:

I (M 19) worked with someone (F 18) on a seasonal job and we got on quite well and so on, but because of the nature of the job we just didn't talk that much.

after her last day at work she texted me (we hadn't exchanged numbers or anything, she found mine out herself through the shared WhatsApp group)

She texted me that it was a shame that we hadn't seen each other in the last few days and asked if we wanted to go for a coffee together.

that was 2 weeks ago, since then we've texted every day and got to know each other a little.

Now this meeting is taking place soon and based on the whole context I would consider it a date, but I'm just pretty unsure and insecure about it😅

I want to make sure Kip is repulsive, but I think I went a bit overboard. I have this version, and another I've written in third person -- and I am going back and forth. I don't want Kip to be so unlikable people won't even get to the actual story. 

Any feedback positive or negative appreciated! 



*🛠️ Here’s the truth: this gear is nothing without me. My legs, my mind, my talent—that’s what makes the magic happen. Sorry to everyone who bought the same shoes and thought they’d run like me. They won’t. ⛰️💥 #KipAndOnlyKip #WahoosAreTheFuture #KipRunsFast*

As I snapped a flat lay of my gear, with a trophy in the corner for motivation and my lucky blue Brooks hat, I wrote the best caption and posted it. Sometimes, I exit out really quickly so I can hear the chirp as the likes start pouring in. 

Being an ultra trail runner isn’t just a lifestyle—it’s a higher calling, and not everyone can handle it. Let’s be real: it takes a special kind of person to spend hours alone on the trails, conquering terrain that would break most people in minutes. While others waste their weekends binge-watching TV, I’m out there, grinding through miles of wilderness, proving I’m tougher, faster, and more resilient than 99% of the population. It’s not just about running—it’s about dominating the elements, thriving in solitude, and pushing my body to do things that most people can’t even fathom. This isn’t for the faint of heart or the weak of will. It’s for people like me—those who refuse to settle for mediocrity and need the world to know it.

I am the picture of the All American Man: I’m a welder, I’m in shape, I have been married for 15 years, and I have a son, who I named Hunter. Every morning, I mix my coffee with supplements, I am healthy, I am strong, and I am powerful. Everyone wants to be like me – I can see it in their eyes when I win a race, when I get out of my Ram 1500, and when I walk into work, welding cap on and ready to go.

\[Note: In reality, the only person who loved Kip was his wife, Angel and his son, Hunter. But that didn’t do for Kip. He was destined for something better than Angel. He knew it, and he deserved it.\]

When I’m not lifting, running, food prepping, or welding, I’m drawing attention—men, women, it doesn’t matter. I crave it. It’s my high, and it keeps me in the spotlight with the Running Bunnies—those gorgeous runners who have no idea what’s coming.

I’d start simple: a morning message, coffee in hand, welding mask on, and a casual “Cheers!” If they replied, it might shift to a “Morning, Beautiful!” Sometimes, that’s where it ended. But often, I’d focus on the new runner—middle-aged, like me, maybe carrying a little extra weight, but hooked on trail running and all its gear. Endless loops, endless trails—it’s their world, and I know how to play in it. If I could nudge one toward a 100-miler, even better. That’s when I’d offer to pace them, a perfect excuse to be close. Close enough to find my way into their tent.

1hsqyca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1hsqyca/hypothyroidism_vent/,Hypothyroidism vent,"22 years of my life wasted, totally gone and I regret every single one of them. Made amazing memories, met amazing people, loved, hated, partied, slept. But fuck medicine and the health system in every single country. 

I come from a third world country, moved to a first world country. Both health care systems suck (not as much as USA thankfully never been in debt).

I was lucky enough when I was 8 that my endocrinologist discovered my hypothyroidism after gaining weight nonstop. My parents sent me to a couple of doctors, therapist, general, etc. but she knew as soon as she saw me. Sadly she retired some years after. Started taking levothyroxin T4. And for 22 years it was just ok. I lived enough.

My whole life was a hell of losing and gaining weight. Cancelling plans because I was so fatigued, or being scared of doing plans in advance in case I’d get tired. Not everyone understands this kind of fatigue, it’s not sleepy, or just a bit tired… it’s the whole body weighting you down as if gravity was just screaming at your every muscle, and if you do something no matter how small, it’s the same as running a marathon.

My first solution for a while was Maca Root. Literally helped me get back into the gym, have more energy, but it was still irregular as fuck. But I’d have good days. Then my digestive system started rejecting maca, my body was just shutting down. Until I had literal chills and I just know my body. If I took more T4 I’d just sweat all day and be anxious, less T4 I’d just be living in heavy fog.

Obviously after being diagnosed with anything for 22 years, I knew enough and read every single thing on the internet. All the diets, all the exercises, every single thing. But all lab results were impecable every single time, year after year.  No doctor would take any risk trying something different of course.

Now a month ago… I broke down in my doctor’s office, cried a bit and just couldn’t anymore. It wasn’t even life, it was just lack of energy to do everything I wanted to do. Insisted on trying out T3 even if the lab results were perfect. She sent me T4 + minimum T3.

2 weeks later…  I feel like I wasted my whole life away. I went out 4 nights out full party in a week, being sick with a cold. Worked one of those days sleeping 2 hours, no problem. Took x, drank alcohol, redbull. Traveled more than 6 hours for christmas to the other side of the country, arrived and still had energy. I don’t know how I’m still up and running at 100%. I feel social every single day. I worked like never before, don’t need as much coffee. Losing weight eating normally, even if I indulge a bit. Nothing irritates me much. 

And the only thing I feel is that this should have been my whole teenage years, my whole childhood. I got bullied a lot in School for my weight. Then in High School I had a hard time keeping up with friendships. But hypothyroidism is not taken serious enough. Just take the pill, labs are ok, and live your life as you can, like a zombie.

My fav advice I've seen here is that the best method is what you stick with, so here is what I've been able to stick with, lately.

I work bilingually in Language 1 with immersion 2-4 months per year at a variable B2-C1 level over the years, depending on how recent my travel is and how much I am paying attention. I did a 6-week intensive language school in Language 2 and tested at a solid A2 but do not feel like I have A2 speaking in this language, which is relevant but not necessary to where I live. And also for work travels, have done survival A0 level phrases in a few random languages.

VOCAB
Training vocabulary is an easy booster. Start with phrases so you can engage in the world, memorize the most common words because most of our conversations never go beyond those, and then find creative ways to expose yourself to vocab themes outside your comfort zone.
* A0-A1. Drops app - 5min per day of phrases.  The free version covers the basics, and it's all you need because rote memorization is not really a good way to learn to speak beyond those basics.
* A0-C1. Anki app - Vocab flash cards. Yes, it's worth the one-time payment. Make sure you download the correct one and not a knock-off.  Users create decks that are available online. You can find highly rated frequency decks (1,000 or 5,000 most common words in a language listed in order) with the word, key grammar like gender, a context sentence, and audio or pictures if you want. You can also add your own cards or decks-- I keep a list of new vocab I encounter in life and add cards for those words weekly, to retain new vocab that I may not see again in life soon enough to remember.  Anki auto-programs how soon you'll see the card again in your studies, using a cool algorithm called SRS that nerds should google.
* A2-C1. Yoga and fitness classes! Museum tours.  Restaurants.  Public transit and getting kind of purposefully lost such that you need to ask directions. I dunno-- find ways to put yourself into silly scenarios where you learn new vocabulary through context clues and remember them because figuring it out was funny.

CONJUGATION DRILLS
Finding verb quiz apps was a game changer for me. Conjugating tenses is a huge part of language classes.  At language school, we covered 6 tenses in 6 weeks, and it was only possible with daily endless recitation, fill-in-the-blank quizzes, and practice prompts that made us decipher which to use when and how little differences in meaning mean differences in tenses. And spelling.
* Spanish: Ella Verbs (excellent app! worth the price! uses context clues to prompt the tense so you focus on what you are trying to say, not the meaning of grammar they don't teach us in the US)
* Many languages: Conjuu (best French knock off of Ella Verbs I've found)
* Extreme nerd alert: KOFI decks in Anki app. Many languages.

LISTENING 
Podcasts.
Search your language + your CEFR level (A1, A2) to find language learning podcasts, try some out, and just pick what you like.  I've enjoyed Pimsleur, Coffee Break, and Slow News in [language] as a beginner.  Switch to compelling native language content as soon as you can.  For me that's the news, some NPR-style longform reporting, and searching in my language for ""best podcasts 2024"" to find the juicy story shows.  Play at reduced speed and look at the transcripts if needed.

IMMERSION
Compelling target language content on Netflix with subtitles in the target language played at 70% speed or whatever, and pause as necessary to translate subtitles with Google Translate camera held up to the screen.  You can also get Language Reactor app, this works for me.  The key is compelling-- pick shows with a hook that immerse you in the story, where you are kind of shocked into needing the translation because you want to know what's happening.  If you need to translate so much it interrupts the story, then you need to slow down the speed or find something easier. Note: Strong recommend for media made in your TL because then the subtitles will match the words and mouth movements exactly.  Dubbed audio doesn't match subtitles and mouth shapes.  TV seems like the best language learning method, but I just personally only like to watch video to relax when my brain is fried so it's not my preferred learning method.

PRONUNCIATION
When reading written text aloud or conversing, you generally focus on the content before the accent.  But when you are singing, you are mimicking not just the words but all the sounds: the lilt, the tone, the speed, the emphasis, the emotion: the accent.  My French got ""bilinguals don't switch to English"" good the moment I got really into singing along to melodramatic French songs. Hip hop is also good for this.  And recite stuff aloud in your goofiest version of the accent because that's probably the accurate one.

OTHER STUFF
* Duolingo is good for spelling: gender, accents, plural agreements, conjugations, learning the sounds of a new script.  I've done it before but my tip is don't pay for premium because Duo is best as a little part of a bigger learning plan.

* Online tutors like a session with a random iTalki tutor is convenient to clear the proverbial brain cobwebs before jumping back into speaking a rusty language instead of doing that with my coworkers. I didn't like Lingoda but your mileage may vary. Their pricing structure is designed to get you tho so cancel early if you are not keeping up! Lots of friends swear by online tutors but I haven't opted for this route mostly because I spend too much time in Zoom meetings for work as it is.

* Immersion travel is a little less good than it's sold to us as, because a small vocabulary that you repeat in most shallow daily interactions plus map and translation apps make it kind of sort of easy to exist in places where you can't even read.  Immersion classes, where you are studying 3-6 hours a day like I did at UNAM CEPE are an amazing gift for leaping forward, because the class setting forces you to keep growing.  I think it helped a lot to structure in these self study tools as part of my CEPE days, though, on top of classes and homework. It's just so easy to not learn and still get by.


My typical self-study day: 
* 10-20 min apps (Duo + Drops for beginner or Anki + Conjugations for more advanced)
* 10-20 min podcasts.  I'll add an hour of TV if I'm really trying. 

That's 20 min to 1h30, 3-4 times per week per language, somewhat regularly. Not a lot. It's hard to sustain more?  I don't have endless time, energy, or talent, but I want to understand people.

1hsqwle,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateIslam/comments/1hsqwle/earthly_descriptions_of_heaven_and_their/,Earthly Descriptions of Heaven and Their Historical Context,"The Quran describes heaven in terms of pleasures that were familiar to people during the time of Prophet Muhammad. For example, it mentions in Surah Muhammad (47:15) that there will be four rivers in heaven:

* Water
* Milk
* Honey
* Wine

These substances were highly valued luxuries in 7th-century Arabia and were associated with prosperity, comfort, and abundance. While this may have resonated with the immediate audience of the Quran, it raises questions when analyzed in a broader context:

1. Limitations of Historical Context

Cultural Familiarity: The items mentioned—water, milk, honey, and wine—were not only available but also highly appreciated in Prophet Muhammad’s time. They symbolized wealth and pleasure in an arid desert environment where such items were scarce.

Absence of Modern Luxuries: There were no mentions of substances or pleasures that became significant in later periods, such as chocolate, coffee, or other innovations. For instance, chocolate (a product of the cacao plant) was unknown in the Arabian Peninsula at the time. If heaven is eternal and transcends human history, its description should not be restricted to what was familiar in 7th-century Arabia.

2. Relevance of Futuristic Concepts

If heaven is meant to appeal to all humanity across time, it would make sense for its descriptions to include elements beyond the knowledge of a specific historical era. For instance, a river of liquid chocolate or milkshake—symbolizing modern delights—might resonate more with contemporary audiences.
Allah, as an omniscient deity, should have the ability to foresee human progress and include descriptions of future luxuries that would appeal to later generations, thus demonstrating divine knowledge and timeless relevance.

3. Flaw in Earthly Imagery

The mention of rivers with specific substances suggests a time-bound perspective, which is inconsistent with the notion of a timeless and infinite paradise. If heavenly pleasures are beyond human imagination, as often claimed in Islamic theology, limiting the descriptions to items known in the 7th century appears to contradict this idea.
Furthermore, why would God, who is believed to be all-knowing, restrict the heavenly narrative to things Prophet Muhammad and his contemporaries could comprehend? Such a limitation might suggest that these descriptions were shaped by cultural and historical influences rather than divine universality.

4. Chocolate and the Question of Omniscience

Chocolate, derived from the cacao plant, was unknown in Arabia during the 7th century. Its absence in the Quran's descriptions of heaven might reflect the historical and geographical limitations of the text.

If Allah is all-knowing, the absence of futuristic items like chocolate rivers raises questions about whether the Quran’s descriptions of heaven reflect divine revelation or cultural context.

Conclusion: A Flawed Description?

The descriptions of heaven in the Quran appear to reflect the tastes, preferences, and luxuries of 7th-century Arabia. The absence of items unknown to Prophet Muhammad’s time, such as liquid chocolate rivers, suggests that these descriptions may be rooted in the cultural and historical context of their revelation rather than an eternal and all-encompassing divine perspective. This could be interpreted as a flaw, as it challenges the timeless and universal nature of the Quran’s message.",1,1735923105.0,DebateIslam,0,1.0,False

I learned to code so I could build this personal finance SaaS to help my Girlfriend who found the topic really stressful at first. It does exactly what we need, but things can always be better so I'd love some feedback whether kind or less so! 

***The Backstory:***

It was created around one question/goal. **How easy could I make personal finance?** 

I'm a big fan of the 80/20 rule. I don't track things to the penny, forget micromanaging every $2 coffee. That's not a license to go crazy with small expenses, but I prefer to focus on the main levers which influence most of the pain or gain. 

This tool is based on that approach. I've validated the concept in Excel which we have used for around a year. We each do our thing once a month, normally after Payday and it's kept us both consistent leading to an increase in savings of over 130% on a 5 figure starting pot.

I was looking for a project to learn to code, and this seemed a great fit as I thought I could make things simpler, quicker and easier using a web app compared to clunky and bland excel. I also thought it could save other people stress and time like it did for her.

***The SaaS:*** 

Here's what it does.

* Budget Tracking

   * Users can enter monthly budget data (income and main expenses).
   * Future months autofill to save time on the majority of items which are recurring (e.g. rent, bills)

* Visual Insights

   * See your largest expenses at a glance and track trends over time (helpful for variable incomes).
   * All raw data is displayed in tables and can be exported as CSV or JSON.

* Disposable Income Calculation
   * Calculates your monthly disposable income.
   * Allows you to apply an optional margin of error to account for small, untracked expenses—saving time without stressing over every penny. (This has saved me so much time)
* Savings Pots
   * Track savings by creating individual pots for each account (e.g., 401K, savings, emergency fund).
   * Autofill's data based on previous months the same as the Budget does.

* Dashboard and Stats
   * Dashboard with key metrics, and progress towards the goals set by the user.
   * Stats page for users to see more detailed metrics. Great for a once in a while review.

***Tech:***

* Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI. I also used Recharts for the visual components which is a lot better than Chartjs.
* MongoDB for the database and Vercel for hosting.
* Mailgun for login links.

Most of them are located in high-cost real estate areas. The same thing is happening with gyms. New gyms being built often have a 'cute' or fancy aesthetic. 



But it wasn’t always this way. A few years ago, coffee shops with the most seats dominated the market, and gyms were essentially warehouses filled with equipment. 

Is this a result of the social media era? 

And a deeper question: why are we, as humans, so drawn to businesses that are cute or aesthetically pleasing?

1hsqoah,https://www.reddit.com/r/High_endcoffeemaker/comments/1hsqoah/keurig_kcafé_barista_bar_singleserve_coffee/,Keurig K-Café Barista Bar: Single-Serve Coffee & Frother Review & Buying Guide,"[Fresh and Trendy – Discover the Hottest New Products!](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=keurig k-café barista bar single serve coffee maker and frother&s=date-desc-rank&tag=smartymode-20)

## Keurig K-Café Barista Bar: A Deep Dive into Single-Serve Coffee & Frothing Excellence

The Keurig K-Café Barista Bar single-serve coffee maker and frother has quickly become a favorite among coffee lovers seeking convenience and quality.  This comprehensive review and buying guide will explore its features, performance, and overall user experience, helping you decide if this machine is the perfect addition to your kitchen.  We'll compare it to similar models and address common questions, providing you with all the information you need to make an informed purchase.


### **Unpacking the Keurig K-Café Barista Bar: Design and Functionality**

The K-Café Barista Bar isn't just another single-serve coffee maker; it's a compact powerhouse designed for coffee enthusiasts who appreciate both ease of use and high-quality results.  Its sleek, modern design fits seamlessly into most kitchens, and its build quality feels robust and durable.  The removable 42-ounce water reservoir is a significant advantage, eliminating the need for frequent refills when making multiple cups. This is particularly beneficial for busy mornings or entertaining guests.  The machine's footprint is relatively small, making it suitable even for smaller countertops.  While not explicitly designed for portability, its compact size makes it easier to move than larger models.  However, it lacks a travel mug-friendly feature like some other models which may be a drawback for those who prefer to take their coffee on the go.


### **Brewing Capabilities: Versatility and Quality**

The K-Café Barista Bar offers a range of brewing options to satisfy various preferences.  It brews three cup sizes – 8, 10, and 12 ounces – allowing for customization based on individual needs.  The """"Brew Over Ice"""" function is a standout feature. This setting optimizes the brewing process to minimize ice melt, resulting in a less diluted, more flavorful iced coffee.  The machine starts with a hotter brewing temperature than usual, extracting maximum flavor from the K-Cup pod before dispensing the coffee over ice. This ensures a refreshing, less watery iced coffee experience compared to simply adding ice to hot brewed coffee.

Another notable feature is the """"Coffee Shot"""" option. This allows you to brew a concentrated 2-ounce shot of coffee using any K-Cup pod, perfect as a base for lattes, cappuccinos, or other specialty coffee drinks. This concentrated shot allows for greater control over the strength and flavor profile of your final beverage.


### **The Frothing System: Hot, Cold, and Delicious**

The integrated frother is arguably the K-Café Barista Bar's most significant selling point.  It effortlessly creates both hot and cold frothed milk, opening up a world of possibilities for latte and cappuccino lovers.  The frothing system is straightforward to use, with clearly marked controls for hot and cold frothing.  The cold froth setting is particularly noteworthy, offering a smooth and creamy texture ideal for iced coffee creations.  The frother works effectively with a variety of milk alternatives, including oat, almond, and soy milk, providing flexibility for those with dietary restrictions or preferences.  While the frother itself is easy to clean, it is advisable to clean it immediately after each use to maintain optimal performance and prevent milk residue from building up.

### **Maintenance and Cleaning: Keeping Your K-Café Barista Bar in Top Shape**

Regular maintenance is key to prolonging the life of your K-Café Barista Bar and ensuring consistently delicious results.  Keurig recommends using their rinse pods weekly to reduce flavor carryover between different K-Cup pods.  Every two months, replacing the water filter will maintain water purity and extend the life of the machine. Descaling every three months, using a Keurig descaling pouch, is crucial to remove mineral buildup and prevent potential malfunctions.  The descaling process is relatively simple and clearly outlined in the user manual.  Keurig also offers a Descale & Cleanse Starter Kit and a 3-Month Brewer Care Kit containing all the essential cleaning supplies for this maintenance schedule.


### **User Experience and Comparisons: Reviews and Insights**

The Keurig K-Café Barista Bar consistently receives positive reviews across various platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and Costco. Users frequently praise its ease of use, the quality of the frothed milk, and the overall convenience of having a single machine capable of brewing both coffee and frothed milk.  Common positive feedback highlights the ease of cleaning and the intuitive design.  However, some users report minor issues, such as occasional inconsistencies in frothing, especially with non-dairy milk alternatives.  Most of these issues are easily addressed through troubleshooting steps outlined in the user manual or through Keurig's customer support channels.

Comparing the K-Café Barista Bar to similar models, such as the Keurig K-55 and K-145, highlights its key advantages. While the K-55 and K-145 offer basic single-serve brewing, the K-Café Barista Bar adds the significant benefit of an integrated frothing system, making it a superior choice for those who enjoy specialty coffee drinks.  The additional features, such as the Brew Over Ice function and Coffee Shot option, further set it apart from simpler models.


### **Tips and Tricks for Optimal Performance**

To get the most out of your Keurig K-Café Barista Bar, consider these helpful tips:

* **K-Cup Selection:**  Experiment with different K-Cup pods to find your perfect brew.  Consider using darker roasts for a more intense coffee shot.
* **Milk Frothing:** For best results, use cold milk directly from the refrigerator when frothing.  Ensure the milk level doesn't exceed the """"max"""" line on the frothing pitcher.
* **Cleaning:**  Clean the frother immediately after each use to prevent milk residue from drying and affecting performance.  Regularly descale the machine to maintain optimal brewing temperature and prevent mineral buildup.
* **Water Quality:** Using filtered water will significantly improve the taste of your coffee and extend the life of your machine.


### **Conclusion: Is the Keurig K-Café Barista Bar Worth It?**

The Keurig K-Café Barista Bar is an excellent choice for coffee lovers who want the convenience of single-serve brewing combined with the versatility of a built-in frother.  Its ease of use, multiple brewing options, and excellent frothing capabilities make it a standout in the single-serve coffee maker market. While some minor issues have been reported, they are generally easily resolved, and the overall user experience is overwhelmingly positive.

He’d been swiping for months and getting nowhere. He wanted to meet people the old-fashioned way—face to face. So, we worked on a simple strategy. Here’s what he did, and honestly, it’s nothing groundbreaking, but it worked.

1. **Started Talking to People Like a Normal Human**

Jack was awkward as hell at first. I get it—I was, too. Everyone is. I told him something I’d learned the hard way: you don’t need a perfect pick-up line or to be some smooth talker. You just need to stop being afraid to talk to people.

So, he started doing what I did when I was in his shoes: talking to random strangers in everyday situations. Doesn’t matter if you’re in line at a coffee shop or walking down the street—say something that is good enough to make things happen. Doesn't need to be some life-changing conversation. It’s just about practicing not being a robot who avoids eye contact at all costs. Jack slowly stopped overthinking it and began making it a habit.

1. **Stopped Giving a Shit About Whether It Led to a Date**

A lot of people get hung up on the idea that every interaction needs to somehow turn into a result. I’ve been there. I remember the first time I tried talking to a woman and immediately thought, ""Is this going to lead to something?"" Spoiler: it didn’t. It was awkward as hell. But I learned that if you’re focused on the end result, you’ll miss the whole point of connecting with someone.

Jack learned the same lesson. He started focusing less on whether every conversation could lead to a date and more on just having a normal chat with a stranger. Sometimes they’d talk for 30 seconds. Sometimes 10 minutes. Sometimes nothing came of it, and that was fine. The key here is he was no longer treating every interaction like a transaction. He just let things play out without trying to force them into a perfect outcome.

1. **Took Action and Let Things Happen**

This is where it clicked for Jack. He realized that dating is just a numbers game of having real conversations and seeing who you click with. No magic formulas, no fancy tricks. Just being out there and not expecting to hit a home run every time.

I told Jack about how I met my girlfriend. It wasn’t some grand, dramatic story. I wasn’t trying to impress her. We just had a casual conversation in a Starbucks in Budapest, and that was it. We hung out a few more times, and one thing led to another.

So Jack started doing the same thing. He’d meet people, have some cool conversations, and occasionally make plans to hang out. No pressure, no ""perfect moment."" He was just putting himself out there, seeing where things went, and most importantly, not overthinking it.

The thing is, dating apps are easy to hide behind, but they’re not the answer. Jack learned that it’s way more rewarding to get out and talk to people in real life. It’s messy, it’s awkward, and it doesn’t always go the way you expect—but that’s the point.

Now Jack’s not dependent on dating apps anymore. He’s learning how to connect with people in real life, and that’s where the real magic happens.

That’s the short version of what worked for Jack. It wasn’t rocket science. It was just about getting out of his own head, being human, and taking action with the help of a mentor. That’s all it takes.

1hsqmdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1hsqmdz/people_who_set_boundaries_about_doing_things_i/,"People who set boundaries about doing things I don’t like are bad and should change! No they aren’t, Karen.","Someone posted in TrueOffMyChest that they like to do something not everyone enjoys and could sometimes be a deal breaker in dating. They said that it’s totally ok to not want to date someone for this reason. They said they wouldn’t date someone who expected them to *give up* that thing they liked. 

The comments were full of people calling OP an addict and suggesting they were a disgusting person for having that boundary as if OP needed to stop their interest and live how the commenters wanted them to live. The post in question wasn’t about drugs at all but that’s the example I’ll use as my issue isn’t about the topic the OP chose, it’s about the responses he got.

Even literal addicts have a right to their addictions so long as those addictions are not hurting anyone else. And before someone tries to attack what I’m saying, let me clarify.

If Bob has no family because they’re all dead or he’s No Contact with all of them, he makes sure that he doesn’t engage in his addiction at work or discuss it in any way at work, nor does he drag his friends into it, then there’s not a damned thing wrong with him.

I hate marijuana. I hate the smell of it; it makes me ill. I hate how some of my friends have sort of given up on chasing success in life and live with the mindset that as long as they make enough money to pay rent/bills, buy food, and afford the next container of weed, they’re happy.

If they don’t smoke it around me and make sure to freshen up so I don’t smell it on them when we meet up for coffee, it’s literally none of my business what they do on their own time.

They’re not bad people because they engage in a thing I don’t like at all. If I don’t like marijuana, fine, then I won’t smoke/eat any? Not a hard concept. If them being into marijuana bothers me enough, I’ll politely end the friendship. I’m certainly not going to tell them they need to “get clean” because it makes *me feel better.*

Live your damned lives and let other people *live theirs* if they’re not hurting anyone else!",5,1735922405.0,PetPeeves,15,0.78,False

New Year’s Day
(A Poem for a Feminine Soul)

     by: Amelia E. 

The clock strikes twelve, the year turns new,  
A whispered promise: “become more you.”
The mirror reflects a tender face,  
A journey unfolding, a sacred space.  

Soft curves bloom where shadows once lay,  
HRT’s touch, like dawn’s first ray.  
Each pill, each patch, a quiet vow,  
To honor the woman emerging now.  

Dysphoria lingers, a ghost in the night,  
But courage burns with a fiercer light.  
For every tear that carves its stream,  
There’s strength in the heart to chase the dream.  

I feel her now, she’s always been near,  
Her voice grows louder with each passing year.  
Her laughter rings like a sweet refrain,  
A melody rising above the pain.  

Today I stand on this threshold bright,  
Wrapped in hope and bathed in light.  
New Year’s Day—my time to begin,  
To love this body, this soul within.  

So here I vow, with grace and pride,  
To walk this path where truth resides.  
For I am she—no mask, no guise—  
A woman reborn beneath open skies.",2,1735922373.0,trans,2,1.0,False

I have been going to the gym 3-4 days a week and tracking intensity minutes using Garmin tracker. Able to get my heart rate pumping in the range of 150-160 during the intense sessions

I also started restricting my meals between 8am and 8pm. I try to finish my dinner before 8pm in any case or I just opt to fast. 

I wanted to check what else I can do in my routine to eliminate fatty liver issue. I read a lot online about the benefits of lemon water on empty stomach and in general. 

Is it good to have lemon water empty stomach or is it just a myth? I usually start my day with black coffee or tea (milk+sugar, can't have black tea).  ",2,1735922179.0,TheLiverDoc,1,1.0,False

What I mean is whenever I ""give up"" on looking for a guy/ impressing a crush (it's always temporarily and done consciously because I like to give myself a break whenever making big career moves OR sometimes due to mental exhaustion, occasional feelings of despair, feeling aloof to all of this, etc.); and this happens when I'm more into 'self-care' specifically. Self-care routines bring me a lot of inner happiness/ peace and these include vain things like doing extra skin/haircare (10 step routines which are so extra but make you feel great), sleeping well, temporarily limiting contact with toxic friends/ colleagues, reading, meditating/ breathwork etc. I also tend to become more reclusive & less available during these ""down-times"" because I feel like I need to preserve my energy instead of being too available to others (which is usually my nature, I keep scheduling group meet-ups, making small talk with almost everyone, etc.)

I literally had my 2 crushes text me last September WHEN i had decided to give up on all of this for some time (I was feeling really mentally down so I stopped making any effort towards them and for several weeks I was only doing things for myself). I remember it happened one night all of a sudden. Both texted me. I was feeling very good on the inside (mentally) since a few days before this happened.

It's not an isolated incident, either. At University (when I was 18-19), I had feelings for a guy who seemed way out of my league due to his large circle (I dont have a large circle of friends, but I know 3-4 people from every 'place' of my life be it school, Uni, work, etc.). I chased him for 6-8 months but eventually stopped because I felt like it would never work, I also got very busy studying. He himself approached me after a whole year.

Unfortunately, I'm chronically depressed , so I cannot bring myself into this phase very often. I am working on it. But, curious to know WHY? Why do men give me more attention when I'm not specifically making efforts towards them? These all men dont even see me regularly enough to notice any significant changes, so I wonder why.

Should I purposely make less efforts then (I have the 'chaser' personality unfortunately (which isnt very feminine), and mostly approach my crush first. I often make my friends from different circles meet-up for lunch/ coffee and insist on all people showing up / not leaving too early. I keep texting people every now and then so that they dont fall out of contact (this isnt limited to romantic relationships). Please do advise me as I'm already 25 with so little experience",0,1735921807.0,AskMenAdvice,22,0.5,False

Today, I decided to climb up into the treetops for a few hours of peace and quiet. The temperature was just below freezing, but the clear sky and winter sun made it feel like the perfect day for this little adventure.

I brought my hammock for comfort, though I didn’t plan to sleep. It was all about the view , looking out over the frosty forest, with the sun lighting up the horizon. The setup took some effort, as always: rigging ropes, making sure everything was secure, and hauling up my gear. But once I was up there, it felt like I was in my own little world, high above the usual chaos.

I sat back, wrapped in a blanket, sipping warm coffee from my cup and enjoying the silence. Moments like these remind me why I love climbing not for the thrill, but for the calm.

1hsqbxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/1hsqbxb/female_is_offensive_tell_that_to_a_rural_woman_in/,'Female’ is Offensive? Tell That to a Rural Woman in India,"Because nothing says “empowerment” like wasting time debating why calling a woman “female” is oppressive. Forget the fact that many women especially in rural India are still struggling —what really matters is whether someone dared to refer to you using a scientifically accurate term. Bravo, feminism. Truly, art of missing the trees, the forest, and the whole ecosystem.

Some modern feminist's argument: calling a woman “female” supposedly reduces her to her biology. And sure, context matters. But is this the hill we’re dying on? While some elite circles are busy dissecting vocabulary, real women are out there battling issues that aren’t solved by changing a word.

Imagine telling a woman in a village that her biggest problem isn’t lack of clean drinking water or education, but that someone called her a “female.” She’d probably laugh—or cry—because this whole debate is as relevant to her life as air conditioning is to Antarctica.

Modern feminism or as I like to call it, 
""Feminism of elite women, by elite Women, for elite women ."" in India increasingly feels like a club for urban elites to validate themselves.
The loudest voices are often wealthy women who’ve had access to everything from elite education to international vacations and/or those born with golden spoon. But instead of using their platforms to uplift women who don’t have these privileges, they focus on issues that matter only to their bubble.
Because why tackle issues for millions of other women who are not in your elite club, when you can invent problems that sound woke and get you Instagram engagement?

Many women in India often don’t have access to basic education? Or do you know that female workforce participation is lower than Bangladesh? Don’t worry, neither do modern feminists—because they’re too busy policing words instead of policies.
We have the influencers, those warriors of Instagram reels and viral hashtags. Their feminism starts and ends with looking progressive. They’ll spend hours making content about “microaggressions” or “problematic” words, but mention something serious—like the lack of healthcare or support for women in informal jobs...

And, many times their issues is mostly about making it men vs women ignoring, families are about mutual sacrifices. Like, a housewife works hard to run her household, but let’s not forget the husband slogging away at a factory or construction site, often in dangerous conditions, to provide for the family.

Modern feminism in India has become a movement for elite women, by elite women. It’s no longer about helping all women—it’s about making the privileged feel better about themselves. And the ones who need feminism the most? They’re too busy surviving to care about what you’re calling them.

TL;DR: Modern feminism in India is so busy fighting over meaningless issues like calling women “female” that it’s ignoring the real problems—education, safety, and economic opportunities. It’s a movement for elite women ""destroying patriarchy"" while sipping expensive coffee.",1,1735921659.0,indiadiscussion,1,1.0,False

Anyways, as I’ve been mentally preparing for everything to arrive, I remembered a moment I had at a coffee shop a couple years ago that has thrown me off. I’m probably overthinking this so thank you in advance for your kindness.

Over the years of going to Starbucks, I’ve always just assumed that one shot of espresso meant just that, one shot of espresso. I would always just order two shots of espresso over ice and drink it just like that. Then, one day I went to a small coffee shop and asked for the same thing, two shots of espresso over ice, and the barista was like “when you say two shots do you mean a single double shot or two double shots?” The barista then told me that a single shot usually refers to a double shot so asking for two shots is technically four. For some reason, this has thrown me into a tizzy ever since and I never know if I’m ordering one, two, or four shots at coffee shops. Are most places generally consistent on terminology here or do some places actually refer to one shot being a double shot?",2,1735921574.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1hsqach,https://www.reddit.com/r/Magfest/comments/1hsqach/annual_pre_game_for_an_excellent_con_thread/,Annual Pre Game for an Excellent Con thread,"A big part of having a great con is good *PRE planning* and getting into a healthy routine which can start today!  Here's some of my tips and hope you all comment with your own routines, techniques, and tips!

\*\*\*

As an avid traveler/con goer it took me way too long to realize having healthy room snacks saves so much time, money, and energy, avoids a lot extra salt and sludge you tend to be pushed into otherwise, and just piece of mind that you know you have something and don't have to be desperate for a $15 sandwich in an hour long line.

This isn't as easy for people flying or without a fridge but still some good options!

**Veggies/Fiber:** snacking peppers, edamame, grape tomatoes, guacamole, hummus, peanut butter, cashews, fruit leather, fruit cups, trail mix

**Protein:** lunchmeat, meat sticks, mushroom jerky, cheese sticks, cheese slices, boiled eggs

**Carbs:** caramels, tortillas, pita, crackers, chocolates (it's ok to have some sweets to not feel deprived!)

If you have a kettle, oatmeal and ramens are potential great options as well.

Some people do whole crockpot meals but I just don't trust the appliances or want to carry so much.  Please do NOT use the coffee maker or iron as food appliances!

**Packing:** if you get a cooler, ice/cold packs go on the bottom, then cold foods, then a bag/cardboard barrier, then non cold foods. There's some great roller options these days.

**Stay hydrated!** The better you treat yourself during the con, the easier your recovery is afterwards.

**Vitamins and Supplements** Look into multi vitamins, magnesium, zinc, melatonin or valerian and start taking the week before. Liquid IV or other vitamin water powders can help your system stay balanced.  Water is life. Always check with your Dr before taking new meds.  

Energy drinks are an energy loan, have a place to refuel properly before you crash.

1hsq9av,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hsq9av/i26f_am_considering_divorce_with_my_husband27m/,"I[26F] am considering divorce with my husband[27M] over this issue, can you please help me try to understand his perspective or if it's fair to feel anger over this? ","I've gotten so many different perspectives from real life friends and this is an ongoing argument, I needed an outside perspective. This will require a lot of background context, here is the story, all fake names of course:

My brother took me in after I was kicked out right after turning 18. Mom is a drug addict and dad didn't want to be a father. My brother has a stepdaughter the same age as me who I'll call Amy. Amy quickly accepted me into her friendgroup consisting of the friend ""John"". John had a huge crush on Amy, Amy didn't feel the same way and thus rejected him. John later introduced me to my now-husband Greg. About a month of me living with my brother, his wife, and Amy, John came out and told everyone that he has a rare heart disease and that if he doesn't find a transplant within a year he would die. Amy was hysterical of course, and shortly after that big announcement he would yet again ask Amy out and she said yes. Some months after Amy admitted to me that she didn't see a future with John, and hinted that she felt pressured to be with him. John was Amy's first boyfriend/first everything.

We did what we could to be supportive of John. I had this nagging feeling he was full of shit, but I was terrified to ""rock the boat"" and get kicked out again. We enjoyed going to shows thrown by local bands (usually in someone's garage or some other place). John would mosh in the pit with us, then disappear, and Amy later would tell me he had ""pushed himself too far"" and coughed up a bit of blood. I'm unsure if Amy ever actually saw the blood, or he carried around fake blood with him for these situations.

We knew John and his family were broke, so we came up with the idea to organize a show with everyone's favourite local bands. We contact a guy whose house we could use, contacted bands who agreed to play, and we stayed up late making patches to sell at this show. We called it ""Save the \[John\]"". It was a success, we raised around $500ish dollars which was a lot to us at that time. I still have screenshots of the instagram posts of this show, this is real.

I mentioned before we're all in the same friendgroup, except my husband who is a year older than me and already graduated along with the other two males in the group. John is the same age as me, so he was still in highschool along with Amy and some other people. This is important because he would often be absent in our shared classes, or be called to the office to discuss whatever and he said it was him being pulled out for doctor appointments. He really went far to make this believable, and his mom was in on it too.

It's almost going to be a year and it's time for John's surgery, as apparently they were able to find a heart transplant. During this time, I distanced myself from Amy for other reasons (unrelated teenage drama) and it caused some tension in the house. Amy wanted to be a good girlfriend and visit John in the hospital, John refused. Amy called all the nearby hospitals, no one had any records of John. Amy asks him, and John comes clean.

John lied to all of us, including my husband (Greg) and all of his friends. The only people that knew was John's mom. I still remember the day I found out, I was in first period government history. My husband started texting me and we were both appalled. My brother texts me shortly after saying not to take the bus, he will pick me up. My brother picks me up, and immediately starts ripping into me asking if I knew. I was extremely hurt and offended that he thought I would ever do something as psychotic as this, and he refused to believe me until I let him go through the texts between Greg and I. I learned his wife was ready to kick me out. Amy spent the afternoon crying, and threatened to call the police if he didn't send all the money back so she could refund everyone, and was busy doing that all day until it was night. No he didn't send all the money back fyi. I was upset for Amy, upset that my brother thought I'd stoop so low, and upset I almost got kicked out again (the abandonment trauma was/is very strong.)

My husband, Greg, and his two other friends were trying to get into contact with John to simply ask him why would he do this. They've all been friends since elementary/middle school so there's that bond. John begins s\*icide-baiting (I don't know if there are censors implemented). This is also important because Greg's father was murdered a few weeks before, so this hit a sore note and he ""didn't wanna lose anyone else again"" as he told me. The guys are panicking, trying to find Greg because he stopped answering his phone. He just says ""I guess this is it.."" and sends a picture of an unknown man parked in front of his house to pick him up. The unknown man was a guy in the scene who picked him up to gave him a pep talk and basically tell him to get his shit together. After that, John began calling me begging me to get Amy to change her mind and date him again, and I didn't know how to handle these situations/what to say so I just said ""Uhh..John you're kinda making me uncomfortable..Just give her some space..I don't know what else to tell you."" and he said ""Wow, really? \*I'm\* making you uncomfortable? Okay. Well then. I thought you were a real friend. Bye I guess.."" and hung up.

We all blocked John, the guys said they wanted to give him a 2nd chance. Whatever. I learned Amy hated me after for not breaking up with Greg, even though he was also lied to and he barely interacted with him after. I didn't argue with her and found that understandable. About two years after, Amy's instagram account gets hacked and we're pretty confident it was John. She makes new accounts, we all move on. My husband's friends are still friends with John despite catching him in more lies before. I expressed my annoyance at my husband still interacting with John, and he explained to me his trauma regarding his dad/John suicidebaiting so I just accept it because I've never had a close relationship with my parents so I don't ""get it"".

We're all good, I get therapy for childhood trauma, life goes on blah blah. I don't particularly respect or care for Greg's friends for being close to John still. I'm very extreme on my morals and to me that is an ""inherently bad person"" act, and I'm frustrated over the fact they never truly held him accountable and continue to brush his behavior under the rug.

Some key info: Greg's friends were stationed outside of our state, so this issue never had to come up because no hangouts were going on. John was still in our state, but Greg never sought him out to hang out together. About 1 - 2 years ago Amy's mom (we are on good terms now and have coffee dates) told me that she had to block John for stalking her socials (some will tell you who viewed your profile which is how she knew) and that John reached out to Amy again and begged to be in her life to which she said something like she has moved on and to find his own peace and leave her alone, then blocked him.

This issue is popping up again because Greg's friends are visiting in town for a bit, so he's been hanging out with them. But they invite John, so my husband's been interacting with them. I told the guys that their friend hasn't changed, he has consistently been harassing my niece. Nothings happened, they haven't dropped him, and that really angers me and shows me that they don't actually care what happened to her or me, as long as they weren't personally affected. This has caused arguments between my husband and I, especially last night, where he went out to eat with 1 guy and John, and I asked him if John wanted to hang out one on one, would you? He said ""No, because I know you wouldn't want me to. But I'd still play games with him.""

This pissed me off so badly, I felt betrayed. He tells me it happened so long ago, about 7 years ago. But John begged to be in Amy's life as recently as 1 - 2 years ago. How can you tell me to get over it when he hasn't changed at all? I told him that even if he doesn't care for Amy, this is someone who nearly got his wife *kicked out.* He said that's unfair, because he was super angry over it and to try and understand where he's coming from. This is why I made this thread, because I genuinely do not understand the logic. If the roles were reversed and that happened to my husband, I would drop any friends that associated with John out of respect for my husband and just genuine pure anger that someone would hurt my husband in that way. I'm actually so bothered by this I'm legitimately considering divorce because to me, who you allow in your life/close circles says a lot about you. I've cut off friends for doing things that are inherently bad. And I know the difference between people who are genuinely terrible, and those who need patience due to trauma/anxiety/whatever issue there is.

Literally.,"Jodie appeared one afternoon, a walk-in client. I was in the office completing notes, and had no appointments planned for after. But I don’t usually accept walk-ins. I like to have reviewed a client’s intake form and made preparations before their appointments. 

Jodie barged past my receptionist and into my office, brown eyes blazing with determination. 

“You cannot turn me down. You have to see me,” was all she said. I stuttered, surprised, then agreed. As if that were the most natural thing in the world. 

She didn’t wait for me to complete my usual spiel reserved for first sessions. Confidentiality, expectations, that sort of thing. 

She cut through my practised words. “I need to know how to control my thoughts.”

“Oh,” I said, a little miffed. I wondered if interrupting others was a common thing with her. “You mean, you want to learn to change your thoughts, make them more helpful, adaptive?”

She frowned. “Yes. I need to not have any harmful thoughts at all.”

“I see. I understand how frustrating negative thoughts are. It makes sense that you want to get rid of them. But the thing is, it is natural to have all kinds of thoughts. Painful thoughts, happy thoughts…”

“No. That won’t do. I can’t have any bad thoughts. Not for more than a second or two. I need to learn to change them all, as quickly as possible, to good thoughts. Or to only have good thoughts.” It seemed interrupting *was* a trend with her. 

“It’s not possible to only have good thoughts,” I said. “We are all…” 

“Oh, you’re useless!” she groaned. 

That stung. “Well,” I said, regulating a sour surge of resentment, “why is it so important for you to not have any bad thoughts at all? That’s rather all-or-nothing an approach, don’t you think?”

“I know how it sounds, okay? I’ve tried everything. I’ve distracted myself, I’ve recited mantras, I’ve blasted positive affirmations on repeat, I’ve done it all,” she vented in a rush. 

Ah. I had an idea of what her issue was. 

“Have you also tried to negate the bad thoughts? Like imagine them being destroyed, wiped away? Do you use any rituals to nullify bad thoughts? Like the mantras you speak about, praying, or thinking good thoughts to replace them?”

She nodded vigorously. “Yes, I repeat a happy mantra until the bad thought goes away. Sometimes, I hit my head hard to stop the thought, then I repeat the happy mantra, then I think good thoughts, until the bad thought has passed.”

I smiled. “What are you afraid will happen if you have a bad thought without chasing it away?”

“The bad thought comes true. Bad things happen. I’ve failed before. Many times. People have…No matter how much I…I’m so tired,” she said, her voice breaking. She swiped the sleeve of her sweater across her cheek roughly, but more tears came. 

“Jodie,” I said as comfortingly as I could, “what that is, is magical thinking. Magical thinking is when someone believes their thoughts can influence reality. This makes them police their thoughts, which leads to obsessive compulsive…”

“No, you don’t understand. My thoughts *do* influence reality,” Jodie cried. Her tears had formed rivulets that ran down her cheeks. 

“I know it feels that way. It can feel so scary, so…”

“Look. How did I get this appointment? Your receptionist said you don’t accept walk-ins. That I’d have to book an appointment for a later date,” Jodie snapped impatiently.

I blinked. “Well…I happened to…you looked like you needed help.”

“Oh? And other clients don’t? Have you ever made an exception to this rule?” She crossed her arms and stared defiantly at me. 

“I…No. But this is a special case…this is…” I trailed off. Why did I make this exception? I hadn’t known anything about her situation. She hadn’t mentioned anything high-risk or urgent when she had barged in. 

“It’s because I willed it so. I imagined you accepting the appointment. I imagined you being unable to say no to me,” Jodie said. 

I almost snorted.

“Well that’s rather…” I was struggling to find a better way to say ‘far-fetched’, but once again, she interrupted me.

“How did you know my name?” 

I raised my brows, and my mouth hung open, unable to find an answer. How *did* I know her name?

“I pictured you knowing my name, my age. I thought it such that you wouldn’t make me go through any paperwork.”

I gaped at her, still silent. I could not explain any of those things, and why I had neglected all those processes. I didn’t even get her signed consent for therapy, 

“I’ll save us some time,” she said, and screwed her eyes shut. “Your receptionist is going to go home now,” she said. 

A knock at my door. My receptionist poked his head in.

“I’m sorry to interrupt,” he said in a panic, “but I’ve got to go home. I left the gas stove on, I just remembered.” 

Without another word, he turned and left.

My jaw hung wide open, and I didn’t bother closing it. 

“See? I think things to life. Now, do you understand why it is so important for me to only think positive thoughts?”

I felt a strange pressure around my neck, like a pair of invisible hands had clamped around it. The unseen hands squeezed harder. I grabbed at my neck, head swivelling frantically from side to side.

Then the pressure disappeared, and I gasped for air, choking a little.  

“I’m sorry! I just…” Jodie’s face was pale, and her fists were clenched tight. “I just had a brief thought about…about strangling you and…” 

The pressure returned, and I clawed at my neck.

Jodie hit herself on the head, hard, and the pressure dissipated once again. 

“I’m sorry!” She shut her eyes and chanted furiously under her breath. I could make out the repeated words after a few moments. “All is well. All will be well.” 

I stared at her in horror, my hands still around my neck, tensing against any sudden pressure that might come. 

The deep crease between her brows eased after a minute. 

A feeling of wellness washed over me, like sunshine across a frozen landscape.

“I’m sorry,” she said again. 

“Did…did you…the feeling of peace, did you…”

She nodded. 

“I…” I found my words failing me. My gobs were smacked. 

How was I going to help her? What could I possibly do? My fear rose with these thoughts. 

“Could you…could you just imagine me being relaxed, composed? Like me being just…completely chill, on-the-ball, unflustered?” I finally asked. 

The tension in Jodie’s face softened a little, and she gave me a small smile, before shutting her eyes again. 

There it was. I was completely calm. Cool-headed, confident that I would be able to help, however wild the situation was. I had been through some crazy times, after all. 

“Thank you, Jodie,” I said, my voice steady. I considered the situation with a sudden clarity of mind. 

“Now,  we can’t do exposure work. Usually, I would ask clients to think those negative thoughts. Think them hard, to prove that they don’t hold weight in reality. That their thoughts can’t affect reality. But for you, exposure’s a no-go.” I leaned forward, and ignored Jodie as she hit her head again, and began to chant her mantra. 

There was no intervention manual for this situation. But there must be a logical way to approach things. 

“When did this begin?” I asked. “When did you first notice your thoughts could affect reality?”

She stopped mid chant. Her brows furrowed. “I…” she swallowed, and hesitated. “I was in danger. I wished really hard to be saved. And I was.”

I nodded. This was fascinating. “Tell me more about that.”

She shook her head vehemently. I could tell from the set of her jaw that there was no point probing. 

“Okay. That’s fine. When was this?”

“About a year ago.”

A year. A whole year of dealing with magical thoughts. It was a miracle she hadn’t gone insane. 

“How did you cope this whole year?”

“It wasn’t that bad at the start. The thoughts only rarely came true. But time passed, and the thoughts got more powerful. Pretty soon, almost every thought had an effect, unless I subdued it, thought of something else fast enough.”

“That’s got to suck. A whole year of this?”  I didn’t bother with professional verbiage. 

Her eyes moistened again, and I hurriedly redirected her attention. I didn’t want her thoughts to get dark.

“So. What was going on in your life, just before it began?”

“I…I don’t know. I was in uni, and…” she shrugged helplessly.

“Did anything out of the ordinary happen? Anything that sticks out?”

She bit her lip, frowning. Then she shook her head. “I really can’t think of anything.”

“Hmm. Have there been times, since your thoughts became more powerful, when you haven’t managed to manifest them? Haven’t had them come true no matter how hard you were thinking it?”

She thought hard again. “Oh. Well, there was that time when I hoped to win the lottery. Another time when I was in a bad place and…wished for the world to end.” Here, she looked away, shame-faced. “And there was once I tried to will all the neighbourhood cats to come to me, and let me rub their bellies. Nothing happened.” 

“Huh. Anything else?”

A darkness haunted her eyes, and she fixed her stare on the ground. 

“I also can’t…can’t will things back to life.”

Something in her tone sent an icy jolt down my spine. I wanted to ask more, but something stopped me. Was it her? Willing me not to ask?

I moved on with the questions. “And these incidents, were there any similarities in the situations? Like what went through your head exactly, what were you doing, who you were with…things like that?”

It took a long time, but we figured out a few similarities.

Jodie had been alone those times. She had had doubts, and had been unable to fully believe in the power of her thoughts. She had been on her balcony. She had also been wearing an obsidian pendant at those times.

“All right then. Experiment time.” 

I began writing on the whiteboard. ‘Thought Experiment’, I wrote.

“Variable 1,” I said, writing at the same time, “Alone, or with others.”

“‘Variable 2, not fully believing in your ability to make thoughts come true, or fully believing. Variable 3, being on the balcony, or being elsewhere. Variable 4, wearing obsidian pendant, or not.”

I stood back and looked at the factors. “It could also be a combination of things, but let’s test them separately first.”

Jodie stared at the board, nodding vigorously. There was hope in her eyes. 

“Alone, or with others, that we can do now. Come on, think a neutral thought. Like…that my coffee is still warm,” I said, pointing to my cooled coffee. 

She scrunched up her face. I touched the coffee cup after half a minute. It was warm, getting almost hot. 

“O…kay. It works. That’s…yup.” I barely stopped myself from saying “badass.”

“Now,” I continued, “I’ll leave the room. Go all the way down to the lobby. And you cool the coffee down, okay? I’ll head right up, take about, say, 3 minutes in total?”

She nodded, grinning. I left the office, made my way to the first floor, counted off a minute or so, then made my way back. 3 minutes, almost on the dot. I walked in, and touched my coffee cup. It was cold.

“Right. So, not the aloneness factor. Variable 2 then. What thoughts do you think you won’t be able to fully believe in?”

Jodie shrugged. “Imagining an earthquake, I guess? I have never manifested anything on a large scale. Or even medium scale.”

I nodded. An earthquake. I doubted she could manifest something that big, however hard she tried. “Go ahead, then.”

She hesitated, then closed her eyes. 

I waited. I realised I hadn’t set enough parameters in place. How long would I wait for? Where would the earthquake be? 

I pulled up my search engine. I was halfway through typing the search terms for current earthquakes, when I heard a low rumble. I stared at Jodie in alarm. She seemed not to have noticed. She was still deep in focus. 

The floor began to vibrate, like a train was speeding by directly overhead.

“Um, Jodie?” I said. The dangling lights of my office were beginning to sway. 

“Jodie?” I said again, fear sharpening and magnifying my voice. 

Jodie shook her head, then hit it. The vibrations stopped.

“O…kay.” I said. “Not the scale of it, or how much you believe in it.” I was strangely calm. I wondered if Jodie was still the source of my calm. Or if I had given up worrying or panicking. 

Jodie nodded, eyes wide. “I can’t believe I did that!” She squealed, face flushed with excitement. 

“Very cool. Very very cool. Now, next,” I said, logically realising how terrifying her powers were, and how much danger the world was in, should things get out of control. Yet, I felt nothing but assuredness. Jodie was pulling the strings of my emotions, I decided.

“Variable 3. We would have to go to your balcony. We’ve already ascertained that your thoughts work here, away from your balcony. Let’s go.”

We made our way to her house, where there was no one home. 

“I thought them away,” she said. Before I could be alarmed, she continued, “sent my parents to the supermarket.”

I nodded. “It’s just your parents and you?” 

A veil of despair draped across her face. “It is now.”

I opened my mouth to ask about it, but found that I could not speak. I swallowed the terror that arose with my wordless exhales. We made our way to her balcony. 

She looked expectantly at me. 

“Now, think about something. Tell me what it is,” I said, relieved to find my voice had returned.

She pursed her lips and cocked her head. “Maybe, I’ll imagine the flowers wilting?” she said, pointing to the pots of plants lining her balcony. 

“Sure.” I sat down on a seat and waited. 

The flowers wilted, then came back to life at her mental commands. 

She seemed stunned, and strangely upset at the flowers’ revival. “They can come back to life. I could do it. Then why…why didn’t…why didn’t any of them…” she trailed off. She looked broken. 

“The last variable,” I said, suddenly feeling a desperate need to move things along, to change the subject. Probably Jodie again. “The obsidian pendant. Go get it, wear it.” 

I hoped it was the right variable. That we didn’t miss any other similarities.

She came back out soon, the pendant on a chain around her neck. It was a circular stone, with a spiral carved into it. It looked like a vortex of sorts. 

“Go ahead. Think of something,” I instructed.

She looked around. Then she looked at me, a strange smile on her face. 

I felt unnerved. “What are you thinking of?” 

She shushed me, and focused. 

“Do you see it?” she asked after a while.

“See what?” I asked. Her face fell, then brightened. 

“This is it! This pendant!” she yelped. “I imagined you having the thought of a pink dolphin! You didn’t get that?” 

I shook my head mutely. I didn’t like her continued efforts to mess with my head. But I was also excited, because her thought didn’t come true. 

“Do something else, to confirm it. Just don’t mess with my head,” I added for good measure.

“I’ll turn the walls blue,” she said, pointing to the cream coloured wall. She thought hard and long, but nothing happened. 

“Oh my god. It *is* the pendant!” She cheered. I grinned.

A pendant that blocked her powers. It was inexplicable. 

“How did you get this?” I asked, when she had calmed down somewhat.

“I bought it from some lady in a road-side stall in…Peru? I think?” 

“Peru. Okay. Wow.” I was thinking of the different mystical beliefs I knew of that surrounded Peru. 

“Well, we’ve got it. Keep this on. Forever,” I said. 

She frowned. “Forever? What if I lose it? Or if it doesn’t go with my outfit?”

I nearly rolled my eyes. But she had a point. She couldn’t ensure she would always have it by her side and never ever lose it. 

I thought for a while. 

“How about we do exposure therapy, with the pendant on?” I asked. 

“Huh?” She stared at me, uncomprehending.

“Exposure therapy helps lessen the significance we place on our thoughts. If you keep thinking bad thoughts as hard as possible while wearing the pendant, it could normalise having bad thoughts for you. Thinking bad thoughts and having nothing happen could help you assign less importance to the thoughts.”

“Okay…?” she said dubiously. 

“The more significance we place on certain thoughts, the more they harass us. For example, the more I tell you that it’s forbidden, even deadly, to think of pink dolphins, the more you would think of it. And the more you think of it, the more fearful you’d get, the more weight it would hold, and the more control it would have over you. So let’s do exposure work. So that even if you were to lose the pendant, negative thoughts wouldn’t be as scary for you. They wouldn’t carry as much weight, and it may be easier to let them go, before they do harm.”

“You’re right,” she said, nodding slowly. “That would be helpful.”

“So, weekly sessions? Twice a week? It would need to be frequent. I won’t be by your side all the time, so it would also be important for you to do exposure work even outside of sessions. Otherwise, one, two hours a week, wouldn’t be enough to…”

“If I have you by my side 24/7, that would be best, right?” She asked, her eyes darting to mine and away. 

“Yes, but I’m not able to…Jodie? What’s going on? What are you doing?” I yelled, as objects around me began to grow in size. It took me a while to realise that it wasn’t the world expanding around me, but me shrinking. 

“Don’t worry,” her voice boomed, almost shattering my ear drums. I held my hands to my ears. 

Her giant face frowned, then she spoke again, at a bearable volume. “Sorry. It’s not too loud now, right?” she asked. 

“What the hell are you doing?” I yelled. 

“Your voice sounds so cute!” she said, giggling. “I can’t take you seriously. Let me adjust that too.” She concentrated again. 

“Jodie, stop it. Whatever you’re doing. Turn me back to normal. Now.”

She shook her head. “I need someone by my side, to help me stay sane. To keep me from destroying the world. From hurting more people. I need to learn to control my thoughts. I need you here.”

I tried to protest, to shout, to rave at her. But I couldn’t. I felt a sudden sense of acceptance and defeat. 

“Okay,” I found myself saying. 

“Don’t worry, I’ve got a beautiful dollhouse that you would fit in just great. I’ll get you food, drinks, clothes, anything you need.”

“I have my clients to think of,” was all I could say.

“I’ll get you a mini laptop. I can think one up. I’ll let it have WiFi. You can talk to your clients anytime you want, online.”

I was quiet as she picked me up, and placed me on the palm of her hand. She took steps, and the world leapt by in swathes. 

“Just please promise me,” I finally found my voice, “to not mess with my head. Please let me still be me.”

She bit her lip. “I already did, but…okay, no further. Unless you try to escape. Or if you don’t cooperate.”

I nodded. 

\---------

It’s been ten months. I’ve been living in a dollhouse, completely alone, save for Jodie’s company. I’ve tried yelling for help when her parents came into her room to clean, but they saw nothing. Heard nothing.

Not a single person in my life reached out. Jodie said she had taken care of it, that they wouldn’t miss me. That was all she was willing to tell me. And I couldn’t contact them. Every time I tried I ended up doing something else, the attempt entirely forgotten. Jodie must have done that too.

I’m going insane. I don’t think I can last much longer. Maybe I should ask her to mess with my head. To help make things tolerable. 

I’ve just had an exhausting exposure session with her. She thought bad thoughts for more than an hour, wearing her obsidian pendant. 

She’s asleep now. It’s a habit of hers now to place the obsidian pendant in the room next to mine in my dollhouse. This time, she had carelessly placed it in the wrong place, right in my bedroom, blocking my path to my bed. 

I stared at it, wondering how I could shove it aside so I could sleep in my comfy dollhouse bed. 

I blinked, and rubbed my eyes. A bolt of adrenaline shot through my system. I stared at the crack on the obsidian. The crack that was not there before. 

Shit. 

The crack deepened and widened[. ](https://www.reddit.com/user/SignedSyledDelivered/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I've made one for Naruto, one for Slipknot, and I love spending time gathering data and putting them into order. Which is why I'm working over at setlist.fm, researching old show dates for a variety of bands, adding them to their pages and all that stuff.

Enter Avatar, or rather, John's old instagram post regarding the band's 1000th show, which they celebrated in July 2022 in Knoxville. He attached a video of their entire show history, from all the way back in 2003, each show numbered up until 1000+. He also asked us which show was out first. Well, mine was in Hamburg in 2013 (also the only time I've seen them live, shame on me). Problem is: The show was missing in the list. Which leads to...

An error in the numbers. You don't have to be a mathematician to understand that if there's even 1 show missing before the supposed 1000th show, this 1000th show becomes what? Exactly! The 1001st show. So I went to setlist.fm and removed the note at the Knoxville show (not without protest by an attendee, but oh well). I also commented on the instagram post, alerting John of the error, and he actually replied with a thank you and the admission that indeed: the list. was. wrong.

Enter autism, or whatever makes my brain work these days, scientists are still equally baffled and confused. With John's list, which I downloaded and made snapshots of for each year, the Internet Wayback Machine, which granted me access to Avatar's old, oooold websites (did you know their very first one from 2001 to 2002 isn't accessible at all?), and a whole lot of coffee, free time and hyperfocusing until 6 AM at times, I managed to actually crunch the numbers, hopefully adding all missing gigs and removing all that were cancelled. And I arrived at the band's actual 1000th show.

July 13. 2022. Deluxe at the Old National Centre. Indianapolis. Not only four shows, but also four days *earlier* than the supposed 1000th show in Knoxville.

Here's the complete fixed list: https://imgur.com/gallery/avatar-gig-history-vzPRtBP - there's two entries on John's list that I wasn't able to find any details on: July 19, 2015, and November 29, 2016. So if these two shows really took place, that would push the 1000th show up by two. Other than that, everything should be correct, unless there's even more shows missing on both setlist.fm and John's list. Who knows. Maybe John.

Let’s face it — compliance planning ranks somewhere between dental surgery and watching congressional hearings on most people’s excitement scale. But like eating your vegetables, it’s essential for organizational health.

# The January Jump-Start

Think of January as your compliance “spring cleaning,” except instead of finding forgotten gym socks, you’re discovering outdated policies. The key is starting before regulators come knocking like unwanted relatives at Thanksgiving.

# Risk Assessment: Playing Corporate Detective

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (spoiler: you have to), is identifying potential compliance risks. This isn’t unlike playing “Where’s Waldo?” — except Waldo is wearing a suit and potentially costing your company millions in fines.

# Policy Review and Updates

Remember that dusty policy manual from 2019? Time to blow off the cobwebs and bring it into the current decade. Consider this the corporate equivalent of updating your smartphone — except instead of getting new emojis, you’re getting updated regulatory requirements.

# Training Calendar Development

Map out your training schedule like planning a Netflix binge — strategic, well-paced, and with enough breaks to maintain sanity. Unlike your favorite series, however, compliance training shouldn’t end with “To Be Continued…”

# Documentation Systems

If it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen. This isn’t just your grandmother’s approach to family recipes — it’s the golden rule of compliance. Establish robust documentation systems that would make a librarian proud.

# Monthly Monitoring Plan

Set up monthly checkpoints to track progress. Think of it as a fitness tracker for your compliance program — except instead of counting steps, you’re counting completed requirements.

# Technology Integration

Leverage technology to automate compliance tasks. After all, if robots can vacuum our floors, they can help track our compliance obligations. Just don’t let them become self-aware.

**Remember**, good compliance planning isn’t just about avoiding fines — it’s about creating a culture where doing the right thing is as natural as checking your phone first thing in the morning. Now go forth and comply!
