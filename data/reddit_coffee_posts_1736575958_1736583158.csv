I tried moving into the street a little in an effort to avoid this troubled man when I notice he is talking to me. I remove one of my AirPods to see what he wants and all of a sudden this guy starts going off on a tangent in Spanish calling me ‚Äúpendejo‚Äù and aggressively approaching me. I kept saying ‚Äúrelax‚Äù and ‚Äúback up bro‚Äù to no avail. When I attempted to cross the street he broke into a full sprint and all of a sudden I found myself entangled in a wild goose chase, screaming ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù and ‚Äúget the fck away!‚Äù. Luckily I am well-bodied and a former distance runner so I was able to outrun this banana, but had I been a woman or out-of-shape, he surely would have laid hands on me. Several Good Samaritan Booninites phoned the authorities during the confrontation, and after several more chases through the street he slipped on the ice and fell flat on his stupid face. Police arrived soon after and I walked home in utter silence. This town is going to shit when I can‚Äôt even walk home from my 8 hour shift in the freezing cold without some random schizoid chasing me like a maniac.

1hyr7li,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hyr7li/hurt_and_at_a_crossroads/,Hurt and at a crossroads ,"So I‚Äôm a father of a 21 yr old son. Ever since I was divorced from his mother the head games started from my ex and her family. Things like he doesn‚Äôt love you as much as us. He‚Äôs too busy to be here for you etc‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  This all started when he was 4. 

I worked in an industry where weekends were mandatory and I tried to make as much time for us and memories as possible. I was trying not to engage with my ex and her family having my actions speak for themselves. After all I love him more than I dislike her. 

This got worse when I started to date my current wife. She had 3 daughters and he was an only child. At first my son loved the idea of siblings. That was until  it came to sharing attention and just siblings razzing each other. Then it turned into the mean girls are always picking on him. BTW they were introduced to each other when he was 8. 

So this all comes to ahead about a year or so ago Mandeep blows up at me telling me all of his aggravations and anger over the last 12 or so years. Mind you we have been out to countless solo interactions with lunches and dinners and coffee shops and this is not come up once. Needless to say, I was shocked. This ended with him telling me that he doesn‚Äôt want me in his life anymore, and to never contact him 
again. I was devastated to say the least.

Come by a couple days ago one of my friends messaged me and said congratulations on your new addition. Me being very confused. I ask what they are talking about and apparently he‚Äôs engaged. Pregnant that I know of.  But I‚Äôm still hurt that he didn‚Äôt say anything to me because he knows how much family is important to me. Do my question is should I send an acknowledgment? Or would that be a violation of his trust and boundaries set forth? I mean the only reason I found out was by accident from someone who thought I knew. So I‚Äôm just trying to make the right decision. Any ideas would be appreciated. ",1,1736582436.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I think my feelings may be reciprocated, is it worth taking the chance?","Using a throwaway as a few acquaintances follow my main account. l'm writing on mobile, so please give grace to any formatting abnormalities. I'll try to keep this as concise as can as to not end up in an indefinite ramble. I was advised it was best to put this here, fingers crossed!

My postie has been delivering to my address for
approximately 3 years now, and as weare seeing one
another almost every single week day, we have gotten quite friendly to one another with playful teasing and bantering. I always find myself all giggly around him and him too with his cheeky grin. Over the last couple of months, we have spent longer chatting at the door with more sincere conversation, an example being that his oldest dog recently passed, which led to many condolences and a big hug. 

He will often do little favours for me, such as bringing my bin to the back gate or picking up my milk from an earlier delivery and such else, just little acts of kindness which I find endearing.

As he lives local to me, we will occasionally walk our dogs together if we happen to bump into one another when out and about. This happens maybe around once a week or so. It was here that we ended up on a first name basis. I found out he was single from our chats on our walks together, and I had mentioned I was also somewhat recently out of a not-so-amazing relationship.

At Christmas, we both gifted another a small present and a card, something neither of us had planned together. I believe it was here things began to click for me, though I always harboured a soft spot for him.

What do you think, is it worth taking the chance? Do you think he's interested? I'm not sure what to say to him in order to ask him out, I was thinking perhaps a coffee at a dog friendly pub, but I'm not sure. I am of the understanding that it will be up to me to make the first move given the position he is in and the risk to his job integrity if he were to initiate. Perhaps it may be better for me to ask if I run into him on a walk.


I have a few concerns surrounding the potential of pursuing what may potentially be coming to fruition.

‚óè - As am in the UK, I am unsure of the legislation Royal Mail may have around pursuing a relationship with someone you deliver to, but as far as I know, there is nothing black and white saying you cannot pursue a relationship.

‚óè - I worry that if my feelings aren't reciprocated or things don't work out, it could have the potential to become quite awkward.

‚óè - I'd also worry that it is quite invasive of me to be fancying someone as they try to get their work done.

‚óè - I am conscious of the age gap, but it does not bother me too much, but I cannot speak on his behalf.


TL;DR: I fancy my postman, and I think he likes me back based on his behaviour, but I worry about it becoming awkward if this is not the case and do not wish to perv on someone just trying to do their job. Thank you!",2,1736582423.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Comprehensive?","Hi folks. Hoping this is fairly cut and dry. I've been anxious about it while the truck is at the dealership so figured to get some opinions here while I wait to hear the damage report.

  
As the title states, forgot I had set my coffee cup on the dash tray of my truck while I was getting ready to leave. As I pulled off it tipped over and spilled everywhere. Immediately began getting all sorts of errors and issues popping up. Eventually they settled, all the warnings went away, but my infotainment screen no longer functioned properly (including all of its features like phone connectivity and AC control). Brought it to the dealer and they mentioned it's throwing an obscene amount of fault codes and would need to be there for a few days for diagnostics. I explained the coffee to him but he didn't bother to notate it, not sure why, maybe he was doing me a solid. He said he thinks it can be covered under the bumper to bumper warranty. I'm guessing there's absolutely no shot once the techs open it up and see the cause.

  
I briefly spoke with Geico, they didn't confirm (or deny) that it would be covered under my comprehensive coverage, just that I should call back and file a claim if the dealer doesn't cover it (which I expect they won't). I'm guessing some electronics will need to be replaced, and on an EV it probably won't be cheap. Is this a clear case for comprehensive coverage? Not a lot online about it.

we dated for 2,5 years.

Listen, i went through all of it.
Idealisation, devaluation, discard, trauma bond, withdrawl symtoms, could not even desl with the though she will date someone else, my brain was not working properly after breakup, suicidal thoughts to the point i thought im not gonna make it, could not stop bawling my eyes out & name a PTSD symtom i had it.

I went through it all.

I now have been out of the relationship since october and the first 2 months were blody hell.
I still have bad days but im doing my work here.
I immediately got to therapy, did selfreflection because i for sure loaded everything on my back! I truly thought i was at fault, i need to change.

I listened to audio books  that helped me see the abuse i went through. And i slowly started internalizing what i externaly had no control over. 
""from why did she to why did i allow this"" and i very fastly saw how similar she was to my narcissistic mother. o repeated a cycle with her!
i may not have a family anymore, broke up contact with my mom long ago and now with her but god damn do i have peace.

And i can now see how bad it was to not have that because i am still so conceous and afraid to do the most normal things like petting my cat or making myself a coffee. Because this triggered her! 

But i am free. i try to fill my life with reading (my new hobby) music, drawing and i myself finally started writing my own book!

i looked at videos of us whixh i uploadef on instastories. All of them are picture perfect relationship. And the only thing i can now feel is just nothing. i see how pathetic she was. Remember what went on behind the video and the only thing i am struggling now is to stay kind to myself and dont smack myself for dating such a bitch.

How complex it is to make the best coffee! It depends on roasted levels, grinder types, and the ratio of coffee beans. Even the type of water is matter. I also have another concern.

I recently had to call out of work so much to the point where i got fired as they did not take my claims to being unable to work seriously.

I have had some success with topical steroids in the past, but sometimes it seems to come back with a vengeance. And cause my skin to thin and become scar-like. Even caused my skin to bubble up because I work in high heat environments as a cook.

Basically I‚Äôve been concerned enough about the results that I am reluctant to ever use topical steroids again. I recently got prescribed tacrolimus. I was pretty shocked by the warnings of potential side effects that are included in the prescription. Basically says you might get cancer. So I have not begun to try it yet. Also read that when absorbed systemically it can cause hair loss.

Does anyone else have similar concerns or are they just trying to cover their ass from any potential lawsuits?

I never read the fine print on steroidal prescriptions..are they similarly scary to tacrolimus?

Father | Paul Yamanka | 39 | He‚Äôs always away working, so she resents him. Her acting up is somewhat of a way to get his attention. She doesn't *hate* him but wishes he was around more.
Mother | Khione | ???| Not sure, honestly.
Grandmother |Sekka Yamanka | 61 | Tries (and usually fails) to keep Ichika in line. They really do love each other, but because Sekka is the disciplinarian things can get a bit rocky at times.
Younger Brother | Yuki Yamanaka | ???| He‚Äôs the golden child, which means he can get away with things she would never get away with. It annoys Ichika endlessly, but she doesn‚Äôt hate him for it. May pester him a bit, but that‚Äôs her right as the older sister.

#Powers:

Name | Type| Description
---|---|---|---
Flight | Domain | The ability to manipulate the winds into carrying the user, emulating flight. This power is ineffective when there are no winds present, and control can be lost when the wind is too strong or too fast, especially during hurricanes.
Air and Wind Manipulation | Domain | The ability to control the air and winds up to 50 mph (80.5 km/h). At an intermediate level, users are known to generate tornados.
Superior Senses | Domain | A trait where some children of the weather gods have more acute and more accurate senses, above the average level for demigods. 
Legendary Temperature Resistance| Minor | A trait where one can resist extremely low levels of cold. These demigods almost never experience frostbite and are believed to have an immunity to freezing.
Preserving Grasp | Minor | A trait where some children of Khione can channel the cold and freeze their target via contact. At the point of contact, the target is quickly covered in a layer of ice that can make movement difficult. After 6 minutes (1 turn) of continuous contact, an entire limb may be immobilized.
Ice Manipulation (Cryokinesis) | Minor | The ability to control ice and other forms of frozen water. Although taxing, users can even freeze water (but for the purposes of RP, the freezing and the manipulation of the frozen should happen on separate combat turns).
Offensive Ice Weapon Manifestation | Major | The ability to manifest a weapon made of ice. This weapon most easily takes the form of an icicle. When it is thrown and makes contact with a hard surface, it will explode into hundreds of small shards in a 5 foot (1.5 meter) radius.

#Appearance:

Even through this though, she is oftentimes considered pretty, even without trying, sometimes to the annoyance of the tomboy daughter of the snow goddess.

If you were to think Ichika was your normal soft-spoken, manipulative Khione kid, you'd have another thing coming. She is impulsive, feisty and a bit of a rebel. Though, her aggressiveness is not to the point of outright bullying, or to the point of an Ares kid. In addition, she wears her heart on her sleeve. She lets you know if she hates you, or if she likes you. She's not her brother, she'd take the straight forwards path every time  She's a bit mischievous, and has listened to the intrusive thoughts a few more times than she really should. She's not malicious, but rather, easily bored and constantly searching for something to entertain her. 

Her interests don't usually go towards the feminine, either. Instead preferring to skate, or snowboard during the winter months. This causes a bit of conflict with her fairly traditional grandmother, but her strong will means that her grandma more or less lets her do her hobbies. Except for her penchant for street art, but what grandma doesn‚Äôt know won‚Äôt kill her.

#Trivia

* Ichika‚Äôs grandmother put her in ky≈´d≈ç classes for a few years now, in an attempt for the zen mindset to help her rebellious granddaughter‚Äôs mood. It doesn't work, at least outside the range, but she still likes it to clear her mind. 

* Ichika‚Äôs Japanese is pretty good, enough to pass without too much of an accent. She is, however terribly rude, but she mainly does it to annoy her grandmother. If she'd talk to a stranger, she'd be as polite as can be. 

* Ichika enjoys flower arrangement and flower languages, being something she did with her grandmother since she was young. It is a hobby that doesn‚Äôt fit her image, and she takes great pains to make sure that others don‚Äôt know, but it may be difficult with her having more siblings than Yuki now.

#History:

Paul Yamanka is the first generation of a Japanese-American family.  A meteorologist, he relocated his family to Tahoe, where he started to build his life, taking care of his widowed mother. It was a particularly wintery November when he met Khione. She took to the handsome meteorologist well, and shortly into their courtship, Ichika was born. 

Rarely for the aloof god of snow, she stayed in a relationship with Paul after Ichika was born. She, being a goddess, couldn't stay very long, especially risking the wrath of her father who even in modern days tends to look upon her children unfavorably. However, she'd come and go with the winter snow, never staying for long, but enough to have a few tender meetings until Ichika was a little over one when her final meeting with Paul resulted in Yuki‚Äôs birth. Soon, after he was born she left the picture entirely with two children being too risky for her to stick around any longer.

Ichika grew up in a close-knit family. Her grandmother helped raise her when her father was busy. Their early years went along well enough, but as she got older she quickly found herself not enjoying the things her grandmother wanted her to do. This, plus her declining grades in school due to her dyslexia and ADHD resulted in her becoming the Yamanka problem child, more or less. She truly loves her dad and grandmother, but at the moment their relationship is somewhat strained. Her focus moving away from her studies (which she never excelled at) into more delinquentish actions like skateboarding and graffiti has led to many an argument in the Yamanka household. 

Ichika‚Äôs relationship with her sibling, Yuki is also somewhat complicated as well. Although she has no real problem with the guy he‚Äôs somewhat of the ‚Äúgolden child‚Äù. In the eyes of their grandmother and their father it feels like he does no wrong and he gets away with *way* more than she‚Äôd be able to. But, he‚Äôs not bad or anything and really she can‚Äôt blame him for how their guardians treat them both. That being said, she‚Äôs not opposed to annoying him when she gets the chance, but even if they were in the same boat, she‚Äôd still annoy him regardless.

Yet, her easy-going life was not meant to be. For a reason unknown to the siblings, a few Hyperborean giants were sent upon the demigods. Yew, their satyr protector called upon three demigods to bring them to safety, Sasha Marszalek, Aoife Hawthorn and Oliver Blackwell to assist with the extraction. After a close call with a hyperborean giant, the demigods booked it and after a meeting with their grandma, left to Camp for good.

#Present Day:

*There are three options here, pick your favorite! For the first one, if you wanna talk to Yuki, ping /u/thefairestofthemalt*

The plane ride wasn‚Äôt too bad. Although they had to do a few layovers, as Yew mentioned most monsters don‚Äôt feel the need to attack in an airport. Although there was a weird moment with a Monster Mart 2 Go that was a close call, all in all it was a smooth flight to Camp Half-Blood. They were plagued with a few more close calls on the road, yet nothing of note as they finally made it over the camp borders. Yew finally seemed to relax as he parked and let the demigods climb out. As the new campers stepped out of the car, a snowflake appeared over their heads. Ichika seemed to jump in surprise as she looked up.

‚ÄúWha-what the fuck is this?‚Äù

Yuki looked up as his reaction was a bit muted, but similarly surprised, despite his attempts to hide it.

""Wow this is so slay. Can I get a selfie with this thing over my head real quick?""

Yew chuckled at their surprise as he looked up at the holographic snowflake. Despite the climate being controlled by the gods, a sudden wind picked up, and some snow from nearby passed the barrier, surrounding both Yuki and Ichika. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from your mother, both of you. Welcome to camp, Ichika and Yuki Yamanka, children of Khione!‚Äù

___

It was only one day since she was claimed and Ichika found herself very bored. 

She didn‚Äôt feel like trying archery yet, the bows were‚Ä¶weird to say the least. She tried a bit on her first day, but the size, shape and even the materials were entirely different. It wasn‚Äôt wood that the demigods, used here but that weird Celestial Bronze stuff that her arrows were made of.

Maybe another day she‚Äôd try it again, but she was feeling surprisingly homesick and so she decided to do some ikebana. She went through the forest and grabbed a few branches. It was a mix of evergreens and a few fruiting branches that she gathered up before she went back into the cabin and started her work.

She placed a vase on the center of the table and started to arrange them together, deft hands moving the branches together gently so that she could form an arrangement that she‚Äôd like.

It was a lot easier to work with her grandma, speaking her mind on how she wanted things to look. Yet, when she was alone she found herself getting more and more frustrated. She found herself at a bit of a block as she looked at the table with the bundles of neatly arranged sticks. 

As annoying as it was, at least she was alone in her cabin now with everyone out and enjoying camp life. The *last* thing she wanted people to see of her was her doing something like this. It was a bit embarrassing, considering the normally refined hobby went against the image she tried to cultivate. She worked on her arrangement in silence, for however long it took. 
___

It was two days since Ichika was claimed, and she decided to try archery again. She got a greek-style bow from the armory and took her place in front of the archery range. Shot after shot was loosed into the targets. To be honest, it would have been good enough for anyone else.

But not her.

She clicked her tongue as the arrow found its mark just barely off of where she was aiming. These bows were annoying, if she was being honest. They were too small, and metal. *Metal!* Why were these bows metal? She was used to bamboo yumis. The feel and everything was just off. 

Focus, focus. Go through the steps.

Footing.

Stance. 

Ready.

Raise.

Draw‚Ä¶

Fire!

Ichika stood in place for a solid second, years of drilling kept her stance until she was off of the zen that was her ‚Äúarchery mode.‚Äù She took a breath as she got out of the mindset and looked at the results. The arrow *barely* hit off the target and the formerly peaceful, zen Ichika groaned in range.

Ugh. Fucking hell.

She wasn‚Äôt used to this.

The other kids at the archery range didn‚Äôt do this shit. They were used to their Greek-style bows. They didn‚Äôt have eight forms they went through each time they fired, they just aimed and shot. It felt‚Ä¶weird if she was being honest. 

Sure, she was doing better than most of these randos that were at the range with her, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Because she wasn‚Äôt up to par by *her* standards and this was like few things she cared enough to put effort into.

Her rage boiled over so white-hot, she didn‚Äôt even notice her freezing over her own bow until she tried to throw it to the side and found it stuck to her skin. She waved her hand in surprise trying to free the popsicle that was her newfound, shitty, Greek bow.

1hyqxse,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1hyqxse/thoughts_on_this_idea/,Thoughts on this idea?,"Hi all,
So I‚Äôve had this idea for a few years now and feel like I need to act on it. An app to make friends. I know apps like this already exist, but none of them have become as popular as dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc. I‚Äôm thinking an app that allows you to add your interests, hobbies, values, political beliefs, etc. just like the dating apps do could be just as useful for making friends. Two things about the idea that would set it apart from the ‚Äúfriend making‚Äù apps that already exist. First: Bumble does give you the option of looking for platonic relationships but from my research one on one hangouts with a person you want to be friends with is not comfortable to people. Also, conversation on the app can be awkward just between two people. Second: There are apps on the market that allow you to make friends ‚Äúall over the world‚Äù but they have major issues with scammers and people generally would like friends who are closer to their location. My idea is to set up the app in a similar way as dating apps, with the swiping and matching to people with shared interests and preferences. But instead of immediately matching with one person, the app creates a group of 4-6 people who all match with each other. This then creates a group chat. There would also be prompts to get the conversation going. The app would also be set to a certain proximity (i.e. 50 miles) so everyone in the group lives nearby. There would be an option to ‚Äúcreate an event‚Äù and invite the group members to meetup somewhere (lunch, coffee, drinks, bowling, anything) and members would rsvp so you‚Äôd know who was coming. To prevent scammers, profiles would require facial verification before your profile would go public. It‚Äôs basically an app that aims to create friend groups. If you want to have multiple friend groups, you can keep swiping and the app will continue to match you with other members. You can always opt out of a group. You can also individually message and add friends if you‚Äôre vibing with some but not the others. You can even create your own group. There would be the option to block users or report them as well. The app would only match you with people within your age range. If you‚Äôre interested in being matched with older friends you can change the settings. You can also set your preferences to a specific gender. Essentially, it‚Äôs just like a dating app but the goal is to put you in a group. The group aspect would make things less intimate thus less awkward. Also, meeting with groups is less awkward than meeting individually. More topics to discuss, less pressure to carry the whole conversation, and being in a group could generally make you feel safer. This isn‚Äôt an app just for people who have no friends. This could be for anyone, even people who just want to expand their social circles. This could open doors for any and all demographics to be able to socialize. We are more isolated than ever, and humans need face to face socialization. We were never meant to only find camaraderie through screens (I understand the irony there), but this would be a means to make long lasting friendships with people who you can visit regularly. The marketing would have to be pretty good in order to reach such a diverse range of users and get them on board, but I think it could happen. If it worked with dating apps, I don‚Äôt see why it couldn‚Äôt work with this. If you read this much, thanks for your time! Let me know your thoughts.",1,1736581212.0,AppIdeas,0,1.0,False

I approached Dr Rolfes for my surgery- forehead brow-bossing and jaw surgery. They‚Äôve been categorically mentioned in several emails prior to the surgery. And, honestly, these back-and-forth over emails, online consultation and my travel happened during the COVID times- and it took me to move rocks to visit the US from Indi ‚Äìsecuring a VISA, exorbitant airfares and profound travel restrictions.¬†

¬†

My first visit to the clinic at Rolfes‚Äô clinic at Wayzata, MN whilst it appeared to me no less than a corporate office; precisely a BPO (business processing Office) ‚Äì the floor meant to Rolfes‚Äô room wherein there were women over hands‚Äô-free microphone sitting in row as it seems from the next door ‚Äìcatching ‚Äòprey‚Äô/customers/patients. To be honest, and I am not at all exaggerating, I felt no less than Fordist mass production ‚Äì‚Äòproducing‚Äô no less of post-surgery patients happy/unhappy with results. And most strikingly, no one even gets a night to stay in the clinic, the day of the surgery. She/he has to pay an exorbitant amount if seeking nursing on the day of the surgery; not even a minute of ‚Äòcare‚Äô for the first 24 hours post-surgery. Seems so, asking to piss-off as the surgery is over ‚Äìmeaning to convey: ‚Äòservice is provided ‚Ä¶.. it is an (corporate) office with well-established coffee machine, reception desk, multiple floors, well-dressed women walking around. But, if you ask for a coffee in the frozen/white/ snowing winter morning traveling so far from a tropical country, not used to the weather, you‚Äôre denied of.¬†

So, Welcome to America !

¬†

The day of my consultation, after waiting a while in the reception area I was called with those simulated hugs/smirks/smiles by the personal assistant of the doctor and asked to entre Rolfes‚Äô chamber. With brief chit-chat with the assistant with reviews been taken ‚ÄìI mentioned with loads of (PLEASE‚Äôs !)¬†¬†requests that ‚ÄúI WANT AN AGGRESSIVE BONE SURGERY). I also did mention, that I am not too pleased with the bone surgeries (facial- FFS) as put in the website of ‚Äòhim‚Äô, and if I may request for an aggressive one. I was so, so categorical with all my memory-in-place and sane mind, that I recall, how intensely and repeatedly I have asked the personal assistant and the doctor over prior online meetings, over emails and in-person in the consultation about being ‚Äòaggressive over the bone surgery‚Äô.

¬†

Rolfes did arrive after quite some time. A ‚Äòcelebrity appearance‚Äô¬†¬†as if consecrating to his presence ‚Äìwhich was just 7-10 mins consultation ‚Äìacross the table sat there and chatting over as I felt, it is not a medical consultation but a business meeting. He hardly allowed me to speak; never touched my face to see/diagnose for 1 second either, stopped/interrupted me from what I want to speak, what I desire for in the surgery was certainly NOT his priority, and kept blathering as what he feels is ‚ÄúRIGHT‚Äù. And, even in that, I managed to say that I flew so far from India, with lots of trouble, an exorbitant airfare, and I truly do want a result of my desire.¬†

¬†

On the day of the surgery, I did again said few times, that ‚Äú Doctor! I truly want an aggressive bone work‚Äù. His mannerism is such so that he‚Äôs busy all the time ‚Äìseems like no time to ‚Äòlisten‚Äô patiently about the queries of the patient. He hardly paid any heed to what I said.¬†

¬†

The surgery went well. YES- a Fordist mass production as we patients were, and hardly that I have seen or heard; have had several surgeries, that the FIRST NIGHT of the surgery, that patient is asked to walk out the clinic, alternatively pay a huge amount (at least for someone from a Third World), and have a night service nurse who practically has nothing to do, when the patient is lying unconscious majorly. Therefore, it is all about MONEY everywhere in his clinic.¬†

¬†

To my utter surprise gravest humiliation, Bryan Rolfes lied to me grossly -- during the stich removal day that he has done a very successful bone work ‚Äì eyebrow bossing and jaw angle surgery. And, I as STUPID person as ever, been waiting all these months (since, early March 2022), that my face would settle, the bruising would completely go away, and I heal in a years‚Äô time as promised by the doctor, and I would have a beautifully-shaped jaw and no bony brow-area.¬†

¬†

None happened! They are all as how it is. I have been SO, SO SILLY, sitting like the STUPID-est person ever that my face would turn beautiful, but I honestly look so ugly. To start with: 1. Bryan Rolfes has done something to my skin that I look 10 years older.¬†

2. He hasn‚Äôt touched even .1% to the reason I have gone to him- Brow-bone shaving + jaw-angle contouring, despite of, I have been time-and-again stressing on the fact ‚Äòaggressive bone work‚Äô for me.

3. He has made a lump-shaped structure on the middle of my forehead, and it is bulged so badly that it seems like, I have a visible and so very unusual protuberance on the middle of my forehead ‚Äìwhich looks out-rightly odd.¬†

4. Please do not take me wrong by no means, but my Indian face has turned into mongoloid Chinese Face post Bryan Rolfes‚Äô infamous surgical craft.¬†

5. And finally, I already have had damaged nervesin the lower jaw from the previous surgery. Bryan Rolfes has aggravated the damage and it is a complete facial palsy now with saliva dripping uncontrolled.¬†

¬†

My surgery-stint from communication over emails, visit to the USA-Minnesota clinic and post-surgery communications as ‚ÄúSTRATEGIC RACISM‚Äù. I am more stunt to the fact that how could he at all lie on the face so confidently. And, We all do pay hard-earned money, been having traveling so far from India with huge flight fares, the lodging expenses for 2 weeks, and others. Adding to all my surgical experiences with regard to my transition; been having done surgeries before elsewhere in other countries ‚Äìthis has been my WORSEST NIGHTMARE SURGERY with the DOCTOR-BEING-THE-LIAR who will ruin your face and would never do what you wish to be changed on your face.¬†

¬†

In addition: I am stunt to see the positive testimonials for this person. I‚Äôm truly not generalizing all, but it forces me to think, that few testimonials are based on acquisition. Given, I chose this surgeon based on reading his testimonials, but he‚Äôs by no means anywhere closer to (to my 200% honesty) , is closer to what I made my mind for the surgery with Bryan Rolfes.¬†

Thank You !

On the flight I watched a movie and I can't find the name of it!! Would appreciate any help with identifying it. Thanks in advance. Some details may be erroneous. 

It was in Chinese with English subtitles. It was set in Shanghai. Its about a boy who was cursed when he was young so all his girlfriends get into accidents. The female star lost her job. There was an office bully, Amanda. It turns out that Amanda had changed her name but had gone to school with the male protagonist when they were in elementary school, and had been the one to cast the curse back then. 

 Anyway the fired female lead tried to get a job with her uncles restaurant but it was failing so she decided to enter her uncle's restaurant staff in a dance competition. I believe the dance group she made was called the Hot Pot Girls, but not sure. At some point she got stuck in the elevator with some important guy who ended up falling for her as well.   She started dating this unlucky guy and he took her home to see his parents. She cooked the father's pet turtle accidentally. Finally at the dance competition she spilled coffee on the soundboard and there was an electrical fire. She broke up with the guy and she ended up with amazing luck after that, and that rich guy wanted to date her but his approach was off-putting.  Amanda somehow got a face full of zits after. Somehow the curse was resolved and she ended up with the male protagonist after all.

What makes it worse is that he also acts this way towards me in front of my youngest sister.

Now my youngest sister thinks its okay to do the same.,"Had an incredibly tiring week where school left me far more drained than it usually does. On top of that I'm going through caffiene withdrawal so I had a bad headache and ended up taking medication and going to bed early.

I woke up later to grab something to eat. As soon as I stepped out of my room, my father saw me and his immediate reaction to my presence was to get up in my face with the demeanor of someone half his age, taunting me, laughing at me, making idiodic jokes at my expense just so he could laugh. He even started making fun of the holes in my shirt even though its supposed to be my IDGAF outfit for inside the house only. I told him multiple times to stop but he kept going. He told me to stay (so that he could keep making fun of me) and when I tried to leave he told me to stay or else he'd get aggressive with me. I am literally getting bullied inside my own house. He knows I'm a serious person and that this behavior boters me but he doesn't care and does it anyways. He has a long history of acting this way but I noticed it gets worse when hes been drinking. I asked him directly if he was drinking and he lied to me and said he didn't. He held up his tall coffee mug and waved it in my face and sarcastically asked if I wanted some. When I went to the kitchen, I saw a bag from red lobster that he ordered for himself 2 hours before I woke up and one of the items on the receipt was an alcoholic beverage that had rum in it. What makes it worse is that he also acts this way towards me in front of my youngest sister.

1hyqmux,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1hyqmux/the_good_boy/,The good boy?,"The *SS Concordia* drifted through the inky black of space, its multi-species crew gathered in the ship's common room. The light hum of the engines formed a soothing backdrop to the lively chatter as the crew shared tales of their respective homeworlds. 

""On Vrixil Prime,"" began Jinn, a wiry, chitinous Vrixian, ""our hives span entire mountain ranges. The air is thick with pheromones, and the hum of our wings is the heartbeat of the land.""

Talla, a wide-eyed, amphibious Nyrvani, nodded. ""Beautiful. But on Nyrva, we don't need wings to feel connected. Our oceans are alive‚Äîbioluminescent blooms stretch for miles, glowing in unison with our song cycles.""

Across the room, Paxon, a hulking Zorran with scaled, boulder-like skin, rumbled in agreement. ""Your oceans sound peaceful. My home, Zorrax, is chaos. Volcanoes constantly erupt, and our people build our fortresses into the lava flows themselves. The heat hardens the stone, makes it stronger.""

The crew turned their attention to Anya, the ship‚Äôs sole human, who was leaning casually against a bulkhead, nursing a cup of coffee. She smirked at the expectant looks. 

""Earth's got a little of everything,"" she said. ""Mountains, oceans, deserts, forests‚Äîyou name it. But what really makes Earth special isn‚Äôt the land. It‚Äôs the life."" 

Jinn tilted their head, antennae twitching. ""You‚Äôve already told us about Earth‚Äôs absurd biodiversity. Plants, predators, microbes that could probably eat half this crew alive. What else could there be?""

Anya‚Äôs grin widened. ""We domesticate animals.""

The room fell silent, save for the soft whir of the environmental systems.

""You *what*?"" Paxon's gravelly voice broke the stillness.

""Domesticate,"" Anya repeated, her tone light but her eyes gleaming with amusement. ""You know, take wild animals and turn them into companions. Partners. Friends.""

The resulting cacophony of reactions was instant and varied. 

""You... befriend predators?"" Talla croaked, her skin flushing a startled green. 

""Not just predators,"" Anya replied, shrugging. ""Herbivores too. Whatever suits our needs.""

Jinn buzzed in disbelief. ""Why? Why would you waste resources on something that doesn‚Äôt contribute to your survival?""

""Ah, but they *do* contribute,"" Anya countered. ""Dogs, for example, helped us hunt and keep watch. Cats controlled pests. Horses and oxen? Transportation and labor. And now? They‚Äôre part of the family.""

""The family?"" Paxon's deep voice rumbled like distant thunder. ""You treat lesser creatures as equals?""

""Not equals, exactly,"" Anya admitted. ""But we care for them, and they care for us in their own way. There's this bond, you know?""

""I most certainly do *not* know,"" Jinn interjected. ""You‚Äôre telling me that on a Deathworld like Earth, where survival is a daily battle, you willingly brought predators into your homes and‚Ä¶ kept them there?""

Anya chuckled. ""Yep. And now we have animals like parrots who can mimic our speech, or even tiny fish called bettas that just look pretty in a bowl. It's not always about survival anymore‚Äîsometimes it's just about companionship.""

Talla‚Äôs wide eyes blinked slowly. ""The concept is... unsettling. Voluntarily cohabiting with other species in such proximity seems rife with danger.""

""Yeah, well, humans are kind of used to dangerous ideas,"" Anya said with a wink.

The room fell into thoughtful silence as the alien crew processed this revelation. Finally, Jinn broke it.

""Wait. If you're so fond of these... pets,"" they said, struggling with the unfamiliar word, ""why don't you have one here?""

Anya hesitated, rubbing the back of her neck. ""Well, I do. Back on Earth, anyway. A dog named Max. I‚Äôm actually working on the paperwork to bring him aboard.""

The uproar was immediate. 

""You‚Äôre going to bring a predator onto *this* ship?"" Talla squeaked, leaping to her webbed feet.

""Relax, he's harmless,"" Anya assured them, though her grin betrayed her enjoyment of their reactions. ""He‚Äôs an old golden retriever. His most dangerous feature is probably his tail when he's happy.""

""And the paperwork?"" Paxon's rumbling voice betrayed genuine curiosity. 

""Endless,"" Anya said with a sigh. ""Quarantine protocols, compatibility testing with the environment, approval from Command‚Äîand that‚Äôs *before* you get into the psychological assessments for the crew."" 

Jinn‚Äôs antennae twitched in disbelief. ""You mean *we* have to be evaluated for *your* predator?""

""Of course,"" Anya said, completely serious. ""Bringing a pet onto a ship like this is a big responsibility. It‚Äôs not just about me; it‚Äôs about making sure everyone feels safe.""

The crew exchanged glances, still clearly baffled by the idea. But Anya could see the smallest hint of curiosity in their expressions. 

""Don‚Äôt worry,"" she added with a mischievous grin. ""By the time Max gets here, you‚Äôll all love him. He‚Äôs great with making friends‚Äîeven the skeptical ones.""

As the crew erupted into a fresh round of incredulous chatter, Anya sipped her coffee, already imagining the day Max would trot into the common room, tail wagging, ready to win over the galaxy one alien at a time.",2,1736579845.0,humansarespaceorcs,2,1.0,False

I was sitting on the couch with my cousins and watching my niece sitting next to the coffee table and she knocked over a drink. I went to get napkins and my SIL and my brother's friend were talking and they turned around as I got up from the couch. It was coordinated and weird.

1hyqlby,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hyqlby/i_didnt_choose_my_boyfriend_they_did/,I didn‚Äôt choose my boyfriend. They did.,"It was supposed to be another boring Tuesday. It wasn‚Äôt late enough in the week to start looking forward to the weekend, but late enough to already feel like I was done with the week. My head felt like it was going to explode from the mind-numbing monotony of work.

I‚Äôd been staring at the same column of numbers on my computer for what felt like hours, my mind wandering in desperate search of something - *anything* \- to break up my day.¬†

‚ÄúI really have to find another job,‚Äù I reminded myself strictly.¬†

I had been telling myself that for years though, but had never managed to make the move. I told myself it was just me being lazy. But deep down, I think I was scared of change - of moving into the unknown. As much as I hated my job, maybe my next one would be worse.¬†

I leaned over to my coworker, Alice, and whispered, ‚ÄúHey, Al, what‚Äôd‚Äôya got for me?‚Äù

Alice and I had an agreement that when each of us got super bored, we‚Äôd share an interesting bit of news or office gossip. The most recent offerings had been things like: ‚ÄúThe red panda born at the zoo was named Ralph.‚Äù - ‚ÄúStrange lights were seen flying over Cincinnati, Lima, Vancouver, Cape Town and Ouagadougou.‚Äù - And,¬† ‚ÄúPhoebe, from human resources, won $11 on a scratch ticket, bought another ticket with those winnings, and then won $5000 so is taking her new boyfriend on a trip to New Zealand.‚Äù¬†

As you can see, really anything to prod the mind into staying alive. We were able to chuck back names we thought would‚Äôve been better than Ralph (Alice liked ‚ÄúBuster‚Äù or ‚ÄúBoots‚Äù while I preferred ‚ÄúBartholomew‚Äù and ‚ÄúAtticus‚Äù) and we shared our jealousy for Phoebe‚Äôs lottery win and griped over never being able to travel anywhere interesting.¬†

Alice leaned in close. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got something good. A serial killer just escaped from a high-security prison,"" she whispered. ‚ÄúNo one knows where he is but people think he‚Äôs nearby.‚Äù

My heart stilled for a moment, then I laughed it off. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true, is it?‚Äù

Alice nodded,¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all over the news. Name‚Äôs Sable Graves.‚Äù

‚Äú*Sable Graves?* No. You‚Äôre for sure making that up,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhen have I ever made up one of my stories, Clara?‚Äù prodded Alice.¬†

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúUm, tons of times,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúOk, fair enough,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄúSometimes I don‚Äôt have *real* interesting stories to share. But this one is true, I swear! And interesting, right? Look it up.‚Äù¬†

I turned back to my computer and opened a browser. I typed in: S-A-B-L

But then I stopped - because I noticed things on my desk were vibrating - shaking - clattering. I gripped my mug of coffee tightly to stop it sloshing all over over my keyboard.¬†

‚ÄúEARTHQUAKE!‚Äù Someone yelled out.¬†

Memories from primary school earthquake drills pounced on me, forcing me to dive without thinking under my desk.¬†

‚ÄúIs this what we‚Äôre supposed to do?‚Äù I wondered, simultaneously remembering something else about standing in door-frames.¬†

The office continued shaking, but not in a rocking violent way - it was more a deep vibration. I held my breath, waiting to see if the tremors would build. And I prayed. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a religious person, but in crisis, I do find myself reaching out. I‚Äôve always had the sense that there is something greater out there. And I figured it never hurt to ask, right? So I prayed, ‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt let it be a bad earthquake!‚Äù

The tremors continued steadily. ‚ÄúAlmost too steady,‚Äù I found myself thinking.¬†

Then a strange humming began - deep and unnatural- but then suddenly it switched to a horrible high pitch. I covered my ears with my hands and screamed. Maybe I thought my voice could somehow muffle the sound - or maybe I just just plain terrified.¬†

Without warning, a blinding white light blasted through the windows, engulfing everything in its glow. That‚Äôs the last thing I remember.¬†

I woke up, face flat on the floor.¬†

I pushed myself up, trying to shake haziness from my eyes. I slowly pulled myself to standing - finding my body was aching as if I‚Äôd been thrown into a wall. I peered around, trying to see if everyone else was ok. It was then I realized‚Ä¶¬†

I wasn‚Äôt in the office anymore!¬†

I was in a house. What looked like living room. One I didn‚Äôt recognize at all.

My heart pounded heavily in my chest. The thumping felt deafening in the still silence of the room. I stumbled over to the door. I tried the handle, but it wouldn‚Äôt move. I was locked in!

I had the sense that something was dreadfully wrong before this, but now I knew for sure.¬†

‚ÄúYou have to get out of here!‚Äù my brain screamed at me. ‚ÄúFind a way out! Find a way out!‚Äù

I scanned the room. There were no other doors, just that one. But a large window stretched across one of the walls. I rushed over, to see if I could get out that way.¬†

The window was covered by a heavy looking curtain. I tried to swipe it aside, but it wouldn‚Äôt move. My brain still wasn‚Äôt working well yet - it took me a couple seconds to realize that the curtain wasn‚Äôt inside the room‚Ä¶ it was on the outside of the window!¬†

‚ÄúWhy is there a curtain on the outside?‚Äù I wondered.¬†

It made no sense. But nothing really made sense to me at this point. I felt around the window for a latch, an opening, anything. But there was no way to open the window.¬†

‚ÄúFind a way out!‚Äù My brain shouted at me again.¬†

I looked around the room for something I could use to break the window. There wasn‚Äôt much in it - a simple couch, a bed in the corner, a table with a few miss-matched chairs around it, a desk with a computer and papers scattered about‚Ä¶¬†

I picked up one of the chairs and hurled it at the window. It bounced back, not even making a crack. I tried again - WHAM! But nothing again. I felt the glass again. I realized it didn‚Äôt really feel like glass. More like a sort of plastic - but it was slippery, almost like it was coated in something. I pounded on it. It felt thick, unmoving. My heart plummeted into my stomach with dread. I knew there was no way I was going to be able to break it. I knew I was trapped.¬†

A tidal wave of fear crashed over me - tears poured down my face. I let myself cry, wail, for about three minutes. But then I told myself, ‚ÄúNo! STOP! Pull yourself together! You‚Äôre never going to get out of here if you fall to pieces. Stay sharp! Stay smart!‚Äù¬†

I wiped the tears from my face and took several huge breaths to calm myself. Then I switched into my logical brain.¬†

‚ÄúLook around,‚Äù I told myself. ‚ÄúMaybe something here will tell you where you are.‚Äù

I scanned the room again, trying to take in details of the room this time. I realized there weren‚Äôt a lot of details. Something about this felt really off. The room didn‚Äôt feel lived in. It felt too simple. Sanitized.¬†

I went to touch the couch. I found it wasn‚Äôt soft. It was made of something solid, hard. Like a sort of plaster molded into what looked like a couch.¬†

I went to the computer desk. Getting close, I realized the computer also wasn‚Äôt a normal computer. It too seemed to be crafted of this plaster substance. The papers scattered around had strange symbols on it. And picking them up, I realized they weren‚Äôt paper, but some sort of extremely thin metal. Nothing I was taking in could I make any sense of.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out.¬†

No one answered.¬†

‚ÄúHELLO!‚Äù I shouted as loudly as I could. ‚ÄúIS ANYONE THERE?‚Äù

I waited. Listening. Silence. But then- I heard something! A dull scraping sound. My head whipped around to look to where it was coming from. A small panel in the wall was sliding aside, revealing a small opening.¬†

I ran over to it. ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù¬†

A tray with a sandwich on it came through the opening, then the panel swiftly slid closed.¬†

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúPlease, who are you? What‚Äôs going on? Hello?! I WANT OUT OF HERE!‚Äù¬†

No amount of shouting or pleading made a difference. No one answered me. I tried to pry the panel back open, but it was impossible.¬†

I looked down at the sandwich on the tray. And I realized it wasn‚Äôt actually a sandwich. I poked it. It was some sort of gelatinous substance shaped and vaguely coloured as a sandwich. Was it even edible? Maybe it was poisonous.‚Äù There was no way for me to know. I pushed the tray away.

I suddenly noticed the curtain on the window was moving - it was opening! I ran over to it to watch as the curtain was drawn back. I don‚Äôt know what I expected to see on the other side, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt what I saw.

I saw a long, dimly lit, hallway stretching from left to right. It was gleamingly clean. The hallway was lined with other curtains, all which were moving aside to reveal windows, like mine. The window directly across from mine was the only one I could get a good look inside of:¬†

It was filled with vines, twisting and reaching toward the ceiling. Puffs of blue mist ejected from tubes into the room every few seconds. I saw a couple small creatures scurry along the vines - they looked a bit like monkeys - but instead of being covered in fur, they had shiny blue scales on them. One of them stopped and looked directly at me. It blinked its little eyes at me, then pulled something from a pouch in its belly. A perfectly round little pearl. It held it up to me, as if showing it off. Then it pushed it back into its belly pouch and darted off to its companion.¬†

I was only just starting to try to comprehend what was in front of my eyes when a door at the end of the hallway caught my eye. It was opening. ¬†

Then something emerged. Spindly legs reached into the hall, bringing a multi-eyed creature closer and closer to me. A gigantic SPIDER! I was paralyzed, my body firmly disobeying my mind‚Äôs forceful instructions to run and hide.

The spider came closer, its eyes trained on my window. For some reason, I guess my body figured if I could just remain still, it wouldn‚Äôt see me. Stupid. The spider came up to the window. I felt its eyes taking me in, scanning my entire body meticulously. Its gaze was so intense I felt it could see parts of me I didn‚Äôt even realize were there - a wrinkle at the corner of my eye, a scar on my hand picked up in childhood long since forgotten. Maybe it could even see right into me - see the blood pulsing through my veins - see my lungs screaming for air as I held my breath.¬†

Frozen in fear, I had no choice but to look straight at it. My first impression had been that it was a gigantic spider, but I realized it wasn‚Äôt quite a spider. Its legs didn‚Äôt look organic - they had more of a metallic look to them than the hairy body that sat on top. The creature had numerous amber coloured eyes, circling its head like a beady crown. Its mouth held sharp fangs framed by what looked a sort of mandibles. One of the mandibles stretched out to my window, almost like a protractible arm with delicate finger-like tentacles at the end. The tentacles caressed the window.¬†

I remained frozen, unable to move. I could feel beads of sweat begin to line my brow.¬†

Eventually, the creature slid its tentacles off the window and disappeared down the hall. That‚Äôs when I lost all use of my limbs. I collapsed to the floor, shaking mercilessly.¬†

Questions swirled in my brain - ‚ÄúWhat was that thing?! - Where in the world am I?? - Why am I here? - Is that thing going to hurt me? - Is it going to *eat* me?!‚Äù¬†

I hurled everything that was in my stomach onto the floor. A pool of liquid acid was left splayed out in front of me.¬†

Then I heard a loud KNOCK on the wall at the back of the room. The lights pulsed in my enclosure.

Then a large panel slid open - and two spider creatures came through! They were coming right for me!

I screamed, grabbing a chair, readying myself for a fight to the death. I swung the chair in front of me and shouted:¬†

‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM ME! OR I‚ÄôLL KILL YOU! I WILL! I SWEAR, I WILL!‚Äù¬†

But they kept coming. It was just seconds before I felt the sting in my side. The creature‚Äôs spindly leg had moved so swiftly I had barely saw it coming. But a point on its end had stabbed me in the side. My body was immediately overtaken by a flood of warmth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to die now,‚Äù I told myself. ‚ÄúThis is how it ends.‚Äù¬†

A haziness overtook me. I realized I felt at peace.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok with dying,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúas long as I stay this comfortable.‚Äù

The chair dropped from my hands. I sank softly to the floor, onto my knees. And I watched as the spiders cleaned up my vomit from the floor. Then they departed. The opening in the wall slid closed and I was alone again.¬†

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôve been dreaming this whole time‚Ä¶?‚Äù I thought, as my brain floated in haziness. ‚ÄúWhen I wake up, I‚Äôll be back home, in my own bed, hugging my teddy bear‚Ä¶‚Äù

But then I felt my mind begin to grow sharp again. I felt myself regain control of my body.¬†

I clutched my hands to my head. I knew I wasn‚Äôt dreaming. I realized I had probably just been drugged when I was stabbed by that spider. Then other questions began to tumble through my mind: ‚ÄúAre those spider things real? - Maybe this is a movie set or something? - Is this some kind of weird experiment? - Am I being filmed? - Maybe this is some sort of twisted reality show?‚Äù

I pulled myself up, driven by this new mission of mine: ‚Äú*Find the hidden cameras!‚Äù*

‚ÄúThere must be a camera!‚Äù I told myself. ‚ÄúThis must be a show!‚Äù¬†

Again, stupid, but that honestly made more sense to me than anything else I could comprehend at the time. I reasoned that lifelike robots, designed for some ethically questionable reality show, seemed far more plausible than actual living monsters keeping me captive.

I searched the entire room.¬†

But I couldn‚Äôt find any cameras. Just plain walls.¬†

This infuriated me. If I had found a camera, at least things would begin to make sense. But nothing made sense. I found my fear transferring into red hot rage. I beat the walls with my fists and screamed.¬†

Then I heard a click-click-click. I looked back to the window and nearly jumped out of my skin! Many more of those spider things had arrived at my window. They gathered around, peering at me. One extremely large one was tapping on my window: click-click-click.¬†

Then I saw a swarm of tiny spiders scuttle up on top of that large one. Their beady little eyes all stared at me with something that almost looked like curiosity. ‚ÄúWere these‚Ä¶ *children*?‚Äù I wondered. The scene looked almost familiar in a strange way‚Ä¶ Like families looking at Ralph, the red panda, in the-

The realization hit me at once like a gut punch.

And my memory flashed to what Alice had told me about strange lights seen over cities. I thought about the unnatural vibrations, the humming, the intense flood of light. And I realized, all this time, I had been wondering, ‚ÄúWhere in the world am I?‚Äù, when I should‚Äôve been wondering, ‚ÄúWhere in the *universe* am I?‚Äù¬†

My enclosure, everything, it all made sense now. I was in a zoo! An *ALIEN* zoo*!*¬†

I had no idea what to do with this information. Emotions like fear and despair and helplessness and anger all swirled together inside me, eventually hardening into a solid rock of spite. I leaped behind the couch and hid. I didn‚Äôt want any of them to have the satisfaction of looking at me.¬†

I curled up into a ball, away from the curious beady eyes. Eventually, I fell asleep.¬†

I awoke to a knock on the wall. It was the same sound I had heard before my alien captors had entered to clean up my vomit. And the lights pulsed just like they did the time before. I scrambled to the edge of the room, staying far away from the wall I knew was about to open. I didn‚Äôt want to get stung again.¬†

I watched the back wall slide open. Sure enough, two aliens came through into my enclosure. This time, I tried harder to see what was beyond them - where they were coming from - if there was any route for escape. But it looked like they were emerging from a large plain box. I wondered if maybe they had to step into another enclosure before entering mine, to prevent the escape I had been hoping for.

But then I realized, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm in space, or on some alien planet, *where am I escaping to?!‚Äù*

Even if I was able to get out of this enclosure, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to just flee home, would I? I thought of the puffs of blue mist in the enclosure across from mine and wondered if maybe my air was specially treated for me too.¬† ‚ÄúWould the air outside even be breathable for me?‚Äù I wondered.¬†

I saw that the aliens were pulling something with them. A platform that hovered just over the floor. On it was something which I couldn‚Äôt quite see as their bodies were obstructing my view. They carefully rolled whatever it was off the platform, then left.¬†

That‚Äôs when I finally saw what it was. A *human*! My heart leapt, knowing I wasn‚Äôt alone. Getting closer, I saw it was a man. But he wasn‚Äôt moving. His eyes were closed.¬†

‚ÄúHello!?‚Äù I said.¬†

He didn‚Äôt respond. I kneeled by his side and saw that he was breathing. I remembered myself waking up earlier, disoriented, in that very same place. ‚ÄúHe must be drugged,‚Äù I thought. I looked at him more carefully. He looked to be about my age, mid 20s, dark hair, with a clean cut look and a strong, tall build. I‚Äôd probably think he was attractive if I was attracted to guys.¬†

I shook his shoulder. It took a couple minutes, but finally I saw his eyes flutter.

‚ÄúHELLO!?‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúARE YOU OK!?‚Äù

The man opened his eyes. They were a mix of blue-green-grey - like a stormy ocean.¬†

‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù He asked, groggily.¬†

I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond, having only just come up with an answer to that question myself. And I found myself too scared to say it out loud. I knew it would sound crazy and I didn‚Äôt want to rattle the poor fellow. Not right away, anyhow. ‚ÄúLet him settle a bit first,‚Äù I told myself.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù He asked.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Clara.‚Äù I told him.

‚ÄúClara. Hi. It‚Äôs really nice to meet you.‚Äù He looked up at me and smiled, his eyes twinkling with charisma. I wondered if he was still under the haziness of the drug. He didn‚Äôt seem as freaked out as I had expected him to be.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you remember?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúI mean, do you remember what happened, before you woke up?‚Äù

His smile dropped. I could see him wracking his brain for memories. ‚ÄúWhere am I‚Ä¶?‚Äù he asked again, as he slowly pulled himself up, taking in the room around him.¬†

Then he swore mightily! ‚ÄúThis is a prison, isn‚Äôt it!?‚Äù He yelled. ¬†

He stumbled to his feet and circled the room, feeling all the walls.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶umm.. do you remember a light?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúA light?‚Äù The man said, confused, as he continued his scan of the enclosure. The window curtain was now closed, so he couldn‚Äôt see into the hall beyond.

The man seemed to be feeling the walls for weaknesses. He hit a button I hadn‚Äôt even realized was there - a wide rimmed bucket popped out of the wall. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be the toilet, I guess,‚Äù he said, reaching down into it as far as he could before pushing it back into the wall with frustration.¬†

I felt suddenly embarrassed that I had been here longer than him and he already seemed to be finding out more about the room than I had.¬†

‚ÄúBut if this is a prison‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, turning to give me a long look, ‚Äúwhy are you in here too?‚Äù

He walked right at me, eyes coldly locked on mine. I found myself retreating until I hit the corner of the room.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in uniform,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre not a guard, are you?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre in a zoo,‚Äù I blurted out. ‚ÄúAn alien zoo. In space.‚Äù¬†

If he thought I was crazy, his face didn‚Äôt show it. His expression didn‚Äôt change at all. He continued staring at me with calculating eyes. ¬†

‚ÄúDo you remember the news stories?‚Äù I asked him, ‚ÄúAbout those strange lights in the sky?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt read the news,‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúOk, well‚Ä¶‚Äù the words flooded out of me in a garbled mess, ‚Äúthere were these strange lights seen in the sky, all over the world- Vancouver, Ouagadougou- I didn‚Äôt think much of them before- not until I was taken. I mean, I think we‚Äôve been taken. By- well, before I woke up here, I remember vibrating, strange sound of humming, and a blast of light. Do you? Do you remember a light like that? I think we‚Äôve been taken by aliens. I‚Äôm not crazy, I swear! I‚Äôve seen them. The aliens. They brought you in here. And they watch us from that window over there. When the curtain is open, you can see other enclosures, with more specimens, like us.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAre you calling me a *specimen*?‚Äù He asked, his voice hard.¬†

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre part of their zoo exhibit, is what I mean,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI think you just need to see them first- to really understand. I know, it‚Äôs a lot to- I get it if you don‚Äôt believe me.‚Äù

I watched as he took in this information. As he scanned the room again, I could see a memory coming to him - a look of realization settling in his face‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe lights‚Ä¶‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYes,¬† I do remember the lights‚Ä¶ I was in the forest, I saw a group of lights high in the sky. I thought they were drones. But one came closer and closer to me. It wasn‚Äôt a drone. I knew that for sure. It was something else. It was huge. It hovered right over me, above the trees. And I remember a horrible noise. And the light. Then I remember you. Here.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo, you do believe me?!‚Äù I asked.¬†

He looked back at me, his eyes twinkling again, with that charismatic smile he first smiled at me with.¬†

‚ÄúClara, I‚Äôm really good at reading people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I can tell you‚Äôre an honest person. I know you wouldn‚Äôt lie to me.‚Äù He took my hand in his and and squeezed it.¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI believe you.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. It felt so good, in that moment, to know I wasn‚Äôt completely alone in this nightmare.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked him.

He hesitated a moment. Then replied: ‚ÄúYou can call me Patrick.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNice to meet you, Patrick,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne bed,‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, confused.¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one bed,‚Äù he said, gesturing to the bed at the side of the room. ‚ÄúYou think they want us to, you know‚Ä¶ be a couple?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No,‚Äù I said, moving away. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a couch too. I can sleep there, it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can sleep wherever you‚Äôd like, darling,‚Äù he said with his twinkly eyed smile.¬†

I felt my heart sink into my stomach. Something about his smile was beginning to creep me out. I went to sit on the couch. I watched as he picked up the tray with the gelatinous sandwich.

‚ÄúThis supposed to be food?‚Äù He asked me.¬†

I shrugged. He took a large bite out of it.¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you afraid it may be poisonous?‚Äù I asked him.¬†

‚ÄúIf they wanted us dead, we‚Äôd be dead, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù he said, munching. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that bad, actually. Want to try some?‚Äù

I shook my head, figuring it would be better to wait and see how his stomach dealt with it.

It wasn‚Äôt long before the curtain opened again. I watched as Patrick approached the window and looked into the other enclosure. He waved to the little monkey creatures across from us. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs showing me something, from its pouch. What is it‚Ä¶?‚Äù He asked.¬†

‚ÄúThe little pearl?‚Äù I replied.¬†

He nodded. ‚ÄúIt seems very proud of it. I think it may be an egg. WOAH!‚Äù¬†

He was now looking down the hall. ‚ÄúWhen you said aliens, I was picturing little grey men,‚Äù he told me.¬†

He appeared shocked, but not really scared. He watched more in curiosity as a pair of the spider creatures approached our window. One extended its mandible out to the glass. Patrick reached his hand out to meet it. Then he laughed!

‚ÄúThis is amazing!‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúI mean, if I have to be kept in a cage, at least it‚Äôs an interesting one. Of course it doesn‚Äôt hurt that I‚Äôve got a pretty girl with me for company.‚Äù

He shot me another smile.¬†

‚ÄúI should tell you,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in guys. Never have been.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lives we lived before,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt matter. Here, *this*, this is all that matters now. Our entire world now exists within these walls.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you trying to say?‚Äù I asked, point-blank.¬†

‚ÄúThat I think you‚Äôll learn to like me,‚Äù he said with a confidence that made my skin crawl. I watched him look back to the window.¬†

‚ÄúOh, come, you gotta see this!‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúThe egg, it‚Äôs hatching!‚Äù

I saw the spiders retreat from our window so decided to go take a look. I went and saw the spiders were now watching the little money creatures. The two were both holding the little pearl, which was splitting into pieces. It was an egg, because inside was a little baby monkey! The spiders clicked their legs on the glass of the enclosure. The parent monkeys held up their child proudly.¬†

‚ÄúI bet they want us to have kids too,‚Äù Patrick said, looking at me with a grin.¬†

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt be happening,‚Äù I told him.¬†

‚ÄúI think you should choose a new name,‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúWhy would I do that?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll have an easier time adapting to our new reality if you leave your old life behind,‚Äù he explained.¬†

Then I remembered his hesitation when I had asked what his name was.¬†

‚ÄúIs your name really Patrick?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was your name before though?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúI told you, before doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúIt matters to me!‚Äù I said.¬†

He just smiled at me, then walked away. I watched as he picked up things around the room, examining them. He rifled through the ‚Äúpapers‚Äù at the desk. He picked one up and felt the edge of it. He pressed his finger along the corner, slicing his skin open.¬†

‚ÄúHmm, sharp,‚Äù he said, sucking the blood away with his mouth. He then started to fold the sheet.¬†

‚ÄúI always liked the name Rosemary,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll call you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Clara,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs Rosemary,‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúHow would you like it if I just picked a name for you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúLike, now your name is‚Ä¶‚Äù For some reason my mind blanked for all male names. But one name jumped to mind:¬†

‚ÄúSable,‚Äù I said.¬†

Hearing that name, he turned quickly to me, his eyes flashing with what looked like rage. I knew immediately I had made a huge mistake.

‚ÄúYou will call me Patrick.‚Äù He said in a calm but ice cold tone.¬†

My heart was thumping painfully in my chest. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Like I was going to pass out. I knew why the name Sable had jumped to my mind - it‚Äôs the name I had been typing into my computer when the office had started shaking. Sable Graves. I hadn‚Äôt had time to see what he looked like.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you like the name Sable?‚Äù I asked quietly, afraid to know the answer.¬†

‚ÄúI think you know why,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you, Rosemary?‚Äù

I looked to the sheet that Patrick - or Sable Graves - was folding and now saw that it now was in the shape of a knife.

‚ÄúMaybe, Sable is a name from your past that you‚Äôd like to leave behind?‚Äù I whispered.¬†

He nodded, his expression remaining stoney.¬†

‚ÄúOk,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI understand, Patrick.""

He smiled at me, but the twinkle didn‚Äôt reach his eyes this time. He pushed his newly made knife into his pocket. I watched him closely as he wandered back to the window. He gazed out of it, watching the little monkeys in the enclosure across from us.¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a cute little family, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù He said.¬†

I nodded.¬†

‚ÄúRosemary, my darling,‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you think would happen if one of us died?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúDo you think they would go back to Earth? Pick us up a new partner?‚Äù¬†

I felt like the wind had been knocked from me. He turned to me, patiently waiting to hear my response.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù was all I was able to squeak out.¬†

‚ÄúI think they would.‚Äù He said.¬†

‚ÄúNot that I think either of us will die!‚Äù He added with a laugh. ‚ÄúNot if we live harmoniously together, like that little family over there. I‚Äôm tired. Let‚Äôs go to bed, my darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll sleep on the couch,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúRosemary, my darling,‚Äù he said softly, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll be more comfortable in the bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe couch is fine,‚Äù I said firmly.¬†

His eyes turned cold again.¬†

‚ÄúCome to bed, Rosemary,‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tired yet,‚Äù I told him.¬†

He started walking towards me. The look on his face terrified me. I grabbed a chair and held it in front of me.¬†

‚ÄúStay away from me!‚Äù I shouted.¬†

But he pulled out the knife from his pocket. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to be a family, that‚Äôs fine!‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll find me someone who will!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember much from after this. I know he tried to stab me. And I know I got the knife from him. And there was blood. A lot of blood.¬†

Then there were spiders. Coming at us. Then the sting.¬†

I woke up, my face flat on the floor. It took me a minute to realize that it wasn‚Äôt the cold hard ground of the enclosure. It was grass! And I could feel the warmth of the sun shining down on me.¬†

I pulled myself up. I found I was in the middle of a field.

I started walking. I walked and walked, having no idea where I was. Eventually, I came to a farmhouse. There was a woman there with her kids. She helped me. She told me I was in Missouri. I‚Äôd never been to Missouri in my life.¬†

The woman phoned 911.¬†

I chose not to tell anyone the true story. I didn‚Äôt think I would be believed.¬†

But I think people deserve to know the truth about what‚Äôs out there.¬†",3,1736579654.0,nosleep,0,0.8,False

1hyqiz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hyqiz8/we_were_perfect_and_he_let_me_go/,we were perfect and he let me go,"I dated this guy for four months, and we spent almost every day together. We actually knew each other from high school, and for years, he‚Äôd message me every now and then to catch up. He kept asking me out, and after what felt like the 30th time, I finally agreed. That‚Äôs how our relationship started.

At the beginning, it felt like something out of a movie‚Äîlike Bella and Edward vibes. We‚Äôd just lie in bed, staring at each other for hours, completely obsessed. He told me he‚Äôd never tried so hard with a girl before, and honestly, he was the most kind, loving, and generous person I‚Äôve ever met. He‚Äôs still the most beautiful guy I‚Äôve ever known.

We spent all of New Year‚Äôs Day together, but a few days later, everything fell apart. We had a fight because I kept asking to see him every day, and he said he couldn‚Äôt handle how demanding I was becoming. For the past month, he had already been pulling away‚Äîcanceling plans and being more distant‚Äîbut this time, he just snapped. I remember him saying, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt I ever be alone?‚Äù That really hurt, but I guess I pushed too hard.

The last time I saw him, he tried to break things off over the phone, but I refused. I went to his house, sobbing, begging him not to leave, but his mind was made up. I asked if it was because of someone else, but he said no. I believe him because he used to post me on the only social platform he had, so I know there wasn‚Äôt anyone else. He told me he has a lot of issues to work through, needs time alone, and just wants to be single. When I left, we both cried, and it felt like my heart shattered. His last words to me were, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you around.‚Äù It‚Äôs been six days of no contact since then.

The last thing he did was call me after I left his house to make sure I got home safe. I miss him so much, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about everything I did wrong. I feel like I ruined it. I‚Äôve been trying to move on‚Äîgoing out, keeping busy‚Äîbut I secretly hope he notices somehow. He doesn‚Äôt have social media, so I have no way of knowing how he feels.

Something strange happened the other day, though. I was at my local coffee shop, which I‚Äôve been going to for years, and I saw his sibling sitting there. It felt so random because I‚Äôve never seen them there before. They were staring at me, and all I could think was, ‚ÄúWill they tell him I looked okay? That I was smiling?‚Äù I guess part of me hopes that‚Äôll make him miss me or think about me.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I want him back so badly, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible. Did I ruin everything? Is there any chance he‚Äôll come back?

She used to look at me and smile. I looked at her, I felt that it was not so, but she used to look at me again and again. I looked at her, and I felt that maybe she likes me. I fell in love with her. I am an introvert and was afraid to talk to her, but I motivated myself. No, I wanted to repeat the mistake that I had made last time in my college. There was a girl who probably liked me, but I never had the courage to talk to her and ignored her. I liked her a lot but I was afraid of regression. She did not like me and that became a one-sided love for me. I thought a lot about her and I spent 2 months in regression. I wish I would have told her that I like her, I would have had a conclusion whether she liked me or not, this time I had decided that I will not make that mistake again, I motivated myself a lot and talked to her, after talking for 2-3 days, I shared my feelings with her on January 10, 2025 and I asked her for coffee, she refused, she said that I was looking at you as a friend, I did not understand why she used to look at me, why she used to smile, she used to come to me when I used to rest. I had again made a mistake, I had thought too much about her, which damaged me a lot, but one good thing happened to me, I came to know that she did not like me and there is a lot more to tell, but this is my short story summary

1hyqgw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/QidiTech3D/comments/1hyqgw5/having_trouble_with_100c_bed_and_zoffset/,Having trouble with ~100C bed and z-offset?,"I was having serious trouble printing ASA at 100C bed temp, it was smooshing very hard into the plate and z-offset was not fixing it. Fingers crossed I solved my issue, so I thought I'd document it in case it can help someone else.

Diagnoses: I noticed during the cal prior to printing that the bed was coming up so far that it was actually hitting the nozzle and causing the whole print head to flex slightly - this was after the clean then the head goes center, bed jiggles up and down a few times, then bed raises to the nozzle. The bed might even hit the nozzle a few times, it's like the printer had no idea where Z=0 was!

Yet I had done a platform reset with  paper, and a number of SCREWS\_TILT\_CALCULATE tweaks at 100C and they were all green, and PLA at bed temps of 60C were great. Also, prior to me replacing the chamber heater fan (via Qidi) I was printing ASA ok, but to replace the fan did require me to turn the unit on it's side so maybe something moved?s

Anyway, I got the idea from u/rhiz0me in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QidiTech3D/comments/1hxtcco/auto_heat_hot_bed_after_bed_leveling/) that perhaps Z=0 needs to be manually set lower for whatever reason. As far I can see this procedure is not documented on the Wiki nor anywhere I could find. \[Note when I say 'Klipper' below I mean via Fluidd ie. Qidi studio or Orca slicer > Device screen.\]

Solution:

1 - Tools>Platform Reset, set the bed to 100C, go have a coffee that will take \~20 mins  
2 - The nozzle will move to the middle and ask you to insert a piece of paper between the bed and the nozzle - make sure the nozzle is clean!  Do not trust the auto cleaning, it sometimes leaves some filament on, so use your eyes to check.  
3 - Normally you adjust the Z position in steps, e.g. 0.01, until you can get normal paper under the nozzle. The key here is, don't use a piece of paper, use something slightly thicker. I used a plastic strip 0.25mm, but a postcard or a quality magazine cover maybe, or even a cut a strip of plastic from a milk carton. Adjust Z up and down until the strip of whatever is snug but not tight, don't have it squished down, but remember how snug it is because we want to repeat that setting shortly. Click next.  
4 - Nozzle now goes to the first corner. Underneath the bed in each corner is a rubber knob locked in by a 7mm nut (see link below). Loosen the nut in the corner the head is at. Turn the knob either way until the fit for our spacer is as snug as the center was. Hold the rubber knob as you tighten the 7mm nut so it doesn't turn - don't over-tighten. Repeat for all 4 corners.   
5  Do a Tool>Auto Bed Level now, you will possibly see the bed is still not very level but hopefully we increased the Z=0 a bit - in Klipper use Tune and load the default, or just look at the range. If it's 0.2 or under then you could probably stop here, but you've had a coffee so power on.  
6 - Get the SCREWS\_TILT\_CALCULATE from [here](https://github.com/qidi-community/Plus4-Wiki/tree/main/content/Screws-Tilt-Adjust). Note you do not need to, or even probably want to, load all of the macros at [config-xplus4 repo](https://github.com/qidi-community/config-xplus4/tree/main) instead just download the code from the [screws\_tilt\_calculate.cfg](https://github.com/qidi-community/config-xplus4/blob/main/screws-tilt-calculate.cfg).  
7 - Klipper>Configuration, then hit the + up the top to upload file screws\_tilt\_calculate.cfg  
8 - Click printer.cfg  
9 - Somewhere at the top of that file where it has the all includes, add: \[include screws-tilt-calculate.cfg\]  
10 - Save and Restart  
11 - Set bed temp to 100C, have another coffee  
12 - Follow the guide at step 6, repeat it as many times as needed to get everything green - you should be able to get them all within 00:05, but most at 00:00 is the goal.  
13 - Keep the bed at 100C, and do another Tool>Auto Bed Level to save the default.  
14 - Test the bed by printing a single layer item - in slicer>prepare, right click bed, add primitive>cube, click cube, then scale, turn off uniform, x-y=50mm, z=0.2mm. Print with a brim.   
15 - If brim is good but 50mm square is not flat, you may need to tweak filament settings, or perhaps add a small z-offset. I personally always seem to need 0.03 for that first layer for ASA but I think it's because I don't have the flow adjusted perfect and it's over-extruding just a tiny bit, which does not show in the brim but does show in the back and forth.

The [knobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/QIDI/comments/1hc0byt/proper_way_to_use_the_bed_leveling_knobsnuts/) you're looking for, stolen from another member u/skarsol ;P

I will update if this falls over later but for now ASA is about as good as PLA.

What if I had never left the church, all while knowing it‚Äôs one massive lie? What if I had some obscene level of dedication, motivation and a bit of self-loathing (I definitely already have enough spite) and decided to just fake it all the way to the top of the church? I just imagine being the most dedicated member of Joe Smitty‚Äôs little cult of all-time. I would have perfect attendance, volunteer for anything I could, pay extra tithing, serving 5 missions, memorize the BoM and its ‚Äúteachings‚Äù inside and out, befriend every senior member, or member in leadership, and just all around kiss as much ass as anyone could ever possibly do to become the ultimate perfect Mormon. I would climb my way up the ranks all the way to the first presidency and then at long last, when I‚Äôm some old ass man, I‚Äôll have finally accomplished my dream. I am the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder-Day Saints. I am the ‚Äúprophet.‚Äù I‚Äôve worked all my life for this moment. I‚Äôm known as a legendary speaker in the Mormon world, and they say I‚Äôm one of the greatest in the history of the church. It‚Äôs a beautiful April day and everyone is anxiously waiting, watching, and ready to devour my holy words as I begin the final talk of general conference, the pinnacle of the event. 

‚ÄúMy beloved brothers and sisters, I am so grateful that I could be with you here today to share these words from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and God, please heed them as in this world today, it is now more important than ever that we open our hearts and listen to what he needs us to hear. HAHAHA JUST KIDDING YOU GUYS HAVE ALL BEEN DUPED AND LIED TO! Oh my god you should all have a look at your faces!! You people actually believe this shit that everyone around here is saying? You people seriously think we can talk to god?!? I‚Äôm your prophet and I don‚Äôt talk to god so you guys certainly don‚Äôt!! No one talks to god, and that‚Äôs simply because he doesn‚Äôt exist!! If I can make it here to be your prophet after 65 years of pretending to believe in him, knowing the entire time I‚Äôm faking it and it‚Äôs all a lie, and god didn‚Äôt stop me then he clearly he doesn‚Äôt exist.  God is a man-made tool that uses mankind‚Äôs inherent fear of death to control you, to make you bend to this leaderships every whim and especially to oppress women!! All of you silly motherfuckers have all fallen for it!! And holy shit how can you guys believe that anything Joseph Smith has done is holy and from god? That dude was a sick man that lied to people so he could get away with screwing young girls, how would any of you guys feel if a middle-age man was doing your 14 year old daughter? It‚Äôs absolutely deplorable, and everything that man came up with was a lie for him to gain from your ignorance. By the way, did you know our financial branch spent 80 million on temple building last year? How much of your tithing went to feeding the homeless or helping the sick? Oh none? Oh okay seems very Christlike. Now that you guys all know the truth‚Ä¶ uhh.. go home and drink some coffee or some beer or some shit! It‚Äôs not that big of a deal. Jesus fuckin‚Äô Christ, motherfucking Mormon church, good riddance hahaha. Also, Hail Satan!! ü§òüèªü§òüèª Oh wait hahah he doesn‚Äôt exist either.‚Äù

 I would drop the mic on the ground and waltz out while sipping a nice smooth scotch from a flask I had hidden in my pocket with a shit-eating grin on my face as some of those around me are trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to pick their jaws up off the floor, while others are disassociating or having an existential crisis. 

Chaos would ensue. My rant would be plastered all over social media as ‚ÄúMormon church president tells members it‚Äôs all a lie during profanity-laden speech.‚Äù Those individuals that are fiscally invested in the wellbeing of the church would be scrambling futilely to mitigate their losses. Many members would leave the church, preferring not to ever acknowledge the existence of my speech or their prior membership in the church. Many members would stay, as their personal subordinate leaders would pathetically attempt to salvage their loyalty to the church all while trying to fabricate yet another ridiculous excuse for why their loving god would let such a spectacle happen. 

I don‚Äôt know if I could possibly enjoy anything in life more than seeing something like that go down. It would be legendary.

1hyq99i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatTraining/comments/1hyq99i/one_cat_attacks_another_but_only_sometimes/,"One Cat Attacks Another, But Only Sometimes","One day at our screen door appeared a <1 YO Seal point Siamese female.  She was meowing (screaming) loudly ""let me in !  let me in !"" .. my wife stood by while I coaxed her to come inside.  As soon as she came inside we realized one of our other cats was in the room -- Grey male tabby 3 YO and very docile and chill -- if I remember correctly he hissed and she barreled him over attacking him and then began a chase.  He got away, but this was the first impression.   That was 6 months ago.

We have our theories about where she was from and how she grew up.  She was very clean but no collar no chip.  Posted, got no responses.  Got her fixed. We adopted her.

So, Fig - grey tabby, 3-4yo  
has known BEEJ blue tortie 8-11 yo for 2 years prior

New cat: Penny - seal point, 1-2 yo (though vet said 2, she grew since then so we dont believe entirely)

She was wild at first, we kept her in a room.  She was very vocal.   Very needy.  Very loyal.  Still is very needy 4-5 months later.  Always wants to be in your lap.  It's diminishing a little bit, so not as much as yesterday.  Spend just a little attention on her and she's your shadow.  We've had her in a Feliway collar constantly because she won't stop attacking and chasing other cats.

We took 3 months to get her out of that room.  She needed to get out of it.  We tried all sorts of things.  Finally, we slowly let the guard down.  Took another month to get them to eat with each other.

[ABOVE:  This is Fig at night, on the tree behind the TV, staring across to us at the couch with Penny, who has taken control of the couch and if he were to emerge from his tree house, she would attack him viciously.](https://preview.redd.it/ultdwrtz6bce1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cc717d96e8c68202f592d358ae8e60d8dc7b013)

Every morning:  all three cats eat within 8 inches, bowls touching.  Under supervision, BEEJ finishes first, then Fig gets nervous and leaves, Penny eats all their food if unsupervised.  Fig does not always agree to this.  When supervised they can be coaxed to do this fairly easily.  On the way to this point, though, there is often chasing by Penny, especially in the morning.  And, Fig will no longer come up to wake us, as he used to with Beeji.  Beeji and Penny will sometimes have a skirmish on or near our bed.  Sometimes no one is brave enough to wake us (Beeji woke us every single day since we got her 5 years ago before this.)

Beeji and Penny seem to get along with boundaries they have set for each other.  They fight with swats but don't touch.  They will swipe at each other but it rarely escalates and ends quickly.  Penny, however, especially at night, appears to approach and investigate Beeji but Beeji doesn't like this and hisses.  Penny backs down.

Penny and Fig on the other hand... Fig lives in constant fear.  Before he was a very friendly cat -- so friendly in fact that you could do anything you wanted to him and he would rarely do anything.  he never claws, would bite but only your ankle, and only lightly, and only in play.

Behaviors witnessed:

* During the day, Penny spends time upstairs.  If Figsley were to come upstairs, she would viciously attack him.    During the day, both Penny and Fig share a room on the first floor in the window seats.  They are ""separate but equal"" and she doesn't chase or attack (though she did when there was only 1 seat, now there is 2 and that has fixed things)  If Fig moves slowly, Penny rarely chases.  If he ""jumps down"" like normal, she will run from the other side of the room and chase him until he is cornered and he runs and runs and they claw and then after some sort of interaction, Penny feigns being wounded and hop away on one foot like she's been bit but is in perfect condition moments later.  I have witnessed possibly that fig has bit her but other times I've been certain she hasn't even been touched so the behavior appears to be literally a lie for sympathy.
* Fig has confined himself to a very small part of the house.  He lives behind the TV in what we now call his ""bachelor pad"" .. prior to this he would be all over the house, sleep anywhere, roll on his back, show his belly, get the zoomies.  Now, he sticks to two rooms (1.25 really) and when he does venture upstairs, its an instant war.
* At night, Penny appears to be -- in my opinion -- attempting to ""pillow"" with the two cats that do not pillow.  Fig exhibited this behavior and was rejected by Beeji years ago.  What I mean by this is, she goes around to each one in turn.  First to Beeji, who hisses at her to leave her alone.  Then she goes to Fig, who hisses at her because she's attacked him 10 times.  This can sometimes escalate, or sometimes, she just returns to us to get in our laps.  When she does this she doesn't hiss, and **a few times she has rolled on her back and showed Fig her belly.**
* Playing with Penny appears to be an unending cycle.  She will play for hours and never tire.  When she does tire, its only briefly.  After that, she will stalk the other cats and chase.
* As the Feliway wears off Penny tends to be more aggro toward both cats.
* Penny and Fig seem to share some traits.  They both play and are athletic in similar ways, have similar body types, and interest in lures.  We have been able to play with them together -but very carefully of course- using multiple lures, however, most of the time we have to cordone them off into separate rooms and closed doors to avoid Penny - who always wants to steal the lure and attack others to get at the lure, unless she is very tired.
* Exactly one time I got all three cats to sleep with me on the couch all night.

I miss my old Fig :(  how can we stop Penny from being a little napoleon???  We don't really have a good way of going back to quarantine.  This is our third intro attempt and I don't feel we could have gone really any slower.",2,1736578214.0,CatTraining,0,1.0,False

(i was one of the first ppl he told, maybe an hour or two after) but then he's like ""i'm not sad about it"". and my head is spinning because holy shit he's single!! ok some background on our relationships: in h.s. me and T were friend but not tight. and over the past 5 months we have grown pretty close as we work at the same coffee shop on campus (T, V, and i all atend the same local community college). he has grown to be my best male-friend and my ""liking"" from h.s. is back and stronger. he's funny and kind and respectful, we agree on politics and parenting styles, he is kind, and smart, ugh i could go on forever. now V and i's past is a little more sorted: we were friends in h.s. before drama between me and V's best friend ruined it. we aren't beefing now at all it just won't ever be the same. and honestly i don't know too much about T and V's relationship but i do know why he said they broke up: they didn't ""think alike"" and he had lost feelings. I'm a big romanticizer so here are a list of the little things yes done that make me think he at least doesn't dislike me: if i'm ever being a like hard on myself he'll like always tell me i got it or i'm not ugly or wtv it is, he calls ME and texts ME, he compliments my fits, eats lunch with me every friday, he asks to hangout, shares his food, has deep intellectual convos with me and listens, there's more too but this all could also be friend stuff. back to what i need advice on, like literally i have face timed him the past two days (im not usually a big face timer) and we are BAKING COOKIES tmr. i think i can't say anything to him right now, cause im sure he's hurting in side and also i dont wanna be a rebound. but like like what signs indicate he might be feeling me or any other wisdom pls. ive dated four guys in the past and three sucked (and the fourth i had no spark with) so obviously im not great with men",0,1736577771.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

I don't want to go out for food anymore because my eating habits have changed. I'm leaning into the weight loss as long as I can (with my prescriber's approval, as I need to lose enough weight for this to not be an issue). This doesn't fit with the old me of merrily going out for a heavy three course meal and eating whatever.

I don't want to go to the pub anymore because I'm not drinking alcohol or caffeine. This pretty much leaves me with fruit juice (rather than my doctor hating me my dentist will hate me, and anyway, there's only so much juice a girl can drink) or fizzy drinks (and there's caffeine in most of them). It feels utterly miserable to go out for a glass of water.

I'm already very sad about giving up coffee (before the diagnosis, I used coffee as a crutch without realising why) so going to coffee shops is difficult, but at least I can usually order some kind of decaf tea there.

Don't get me wrong, I love what the meds are doing for my focus and clarity of thought, but I need to make some lifestyle changes to go along with the diagnosis, and I'm not sure what do about going out. I think if you knew me before and you realised how reluctant I was to go out now and eat a lot of food and drink a gallon of coffee, you'd think I'd developed an eating disorder or had started using one of those weight loss injections. As it stands, I'm just less impulsive on medication, and I'm spreading my food through the day to manage the side effects. I also find it harder to keep eating when I'm full now that I don't have a bucketload of impulsivity to override the full signals.

1hyq2gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hyq2gl/dating_advice_i_cant_afford_therapy/,"Dating advice, I can‚Äôt afford therapy","I (26, F) started dating my boyfriend (34, M) about two months ago. As someone with a past of attracting abusers and ignoring red flags, I am trying to be cautious this time. I tend to match energies with people and I‚Äôm really trying to discern whether I‚Äôm being lovebombed or if he‚Äôs genuinely just interested. For context, we are both ADHD as hell‚Äî not sure if it matters except it really cuts the small talk we hate. Our friends are also largely mutual so I feel I can‚Äôt get unbiased advice from anyone. 

We were both into each other as soon as we met and had our first lunch date, which ended up being just us walking around for 9+ hours talking about everything (our views on life, childhood experiences that shaped us, etc.‚Äî important things to see if we aligned but also frivolous and fun things too). 

Second date, we had coffee and voted together (LOL). 

We had a few more small get-togethers before we started going to each others‚Äô places, and we didn‚Äôt fool around or have sex until about a month in (and no pressure at all). 

The potential lovebombing comes in with him bringing over things like a soundbar and roku for the tv (but I feel like that was more for him bc I have a shitty tv and a broken ps2 for streaming Lol), toys/treats for the dog, giving me small knickknacks etc. It might be that my narcissistic dad would do things like this and then throw it in my face. My brain wonders if we fought or broke up would he demand for it all back? 

Here‚Äôs where some of the red flags could be. We spent Christmas together and after he said he wouldn‚Äôt do anything extreme, he got me a new phone (he got it for free bc he got his mom and iPad but still) and offered to add me to his phone plan. I thought about it for a couple of days and said no to it. With my history, I was worried it could be a manipulation thing somehow. The only reason I chose to believe he had genuine intentions is bc of what I know of how actually genuine he is and because his family are also all sooo genuine and kind (how he was brought up). But I‚Äôm also not saying that means malicious intent is not possible, I realize it is. 

Mind you, this is through text, but I felt like his energy shifted after this/he took a step back which felt daunting to someone who considers themselves pretty in touch with that stuff. I have my only break from school the week of NY and we had planned to spend it together/take off work and I had been looking forward to it. He got approved for a new condo during this time and moved in. Break rolls around and suddenly he isn‚Äôt taking off any days off work anymore. I felt it was related to the energy shift. I asked if we could talk about it when we saw each other next. 

Then he kind of tried to skeet by spending NYE together with our mutual friends saying he ‚Äúspaced it‚Äù (he is not the person to do so). We ended up all spending it together but weird. The next day I see his ex texted him (had a very on/off relationship with her for years and they were engaged roughly 4-5 years ago). He had told me around Xmas she was reaching out and he hadn‚Äôt been opening them, but it rubbed me wrong considering we were in a sort of limbo. This is still before we had a discussion about the situation. 

So once we discussed it, I really liked how he handled it. It was very calm and no weird energies, just us on the same team which I loved. He felt that once he got the condo he was worried about finances so didn‚Äôt want to take off work anymore but agreed he should have communicated better and he sees how it was hurtful. I also made it clear I‚Äôm not okay with it being a reoccurrence. Regarding the phone, he said he did take a step back because he was worried he freaked me out and didn‚Äôt wanna chase me off. Where I‚Äôm not sure if I did the right thing is choosing to believe/trust what he previously said about not communicating with the ex. I‚Äôm not interested in anything toxic so I chose to just believe him unless I‚Äôm shown otherwise. 

Things have been totally peachy in the time since and we‚Äôre on the same level/have been since we talked. And we did drop the love bomb which I get is early. He‚Äôs been so supportive of anything I‚Äôve expressed interest in, has never been demanding of my time even when texting, and I love that he compliments me as a person and not just ‚Äúyou do this for me and I like it‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so pretty.‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty cooked emotionally and am invested already but I wanna know what y‚Äôall think???

1hyq1sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hyq1sa/trees_part_one/,Trees (part one?) ,"I am writing this here hoping to find some answers explaining my late fathers recent passing. After we found out that he had been cheating on our mother years ago among a slew of other things amounting to having a second family, we had basically cut ties with him altogether.I have not communicated with him since my senior year of highschool, almost a decade ago. I hadn't thought of him in years when a few months ago I got a call from someone informing me he had kicked the bucket.

As some strange way of trying to reconcile with us, my father had left everything he had owned to me and my sister, Robin. Robin tragically died a few years back in a drunk driving accident while in grad-school. She would have been a lawyer. That left me as the sole heir to my fathers inheritance. Turns out, life had not treated him so well in the years since he had left our family. His other family didn't take too kindly to my fathers antics once they heard from Robin who tracked them down on social media and informed them of his double life.

My father had been living alone for the majority of the last nine and a half years and had become somewhat of a shut-in. He had moved out to the middle of nowhere Washington, among the trees and sticks and lived an exceedingly solitary life, which is why it was so strange when he was found in the woods bordering his house, a mile away, with almost every bone in his body broken and bent at odd angles.His body was found by two middle age hunters who had been spotlighting that night and were unfortunate enough to come across this gruesome visual. My fathers body sprawled out, head facing up, his torso twisted around under the ribcage so that his hips were front side down and the skin around his waist was twisted and pulled tight, almost breaking. His left knee went the wrong way, his right ankle spun so that his foot was backwards, his leg bone broke the skin in some places, matching his arms and a couple of ribs so that his body formed a grizzly, crumpled mass of flesh, blood, and bone-spikes.

The hunters ran back in the way they came out of pure instinctual fear and adrenaline on seeing this cruel display of a violent end. When they reached a point where their phone had a signal one of them contacted law enforcement and alerted them to the situation. When the investigators arrived, the sun was just beginning to rise and a cool blue morning light dimly illuminated the scene through the trees. No one could make any sense of what had happened. It was clear to them via autopsy that he had only been dead for a couple of days at the point of being discovered. For some inexplicable reason,plants and grass had already begun to grow, wrapping his body. There was no rational explanation. The leading theory was that my sixty year old,unfit, father had scaled a very tall tree and flung himself down with enough force to do that amount of damage to himself, or that someone had done this to him and then carried his six foot, two hundred fifty pound body a mile into the woods and placed him here. There were no dragging or tire marks anywhere around the area. Animals had been ruled out because of the fact that there wasn‚Äôt a single bite mark or claw mark anywhere on his body. It was utterly dumbfounding to everyone who witnessed it.

The woods around his body seemed slightly unsettling to investigators and law enforcement who spent time there. Everything seemed very manicured and deliberate. The trees seemed too evenly spaced, the leaves and pine needles covered the ground too well. There was no breeze. Nothing moved. Above all there was a distinct, noticeable, silence, the only sound you could hear was your breath and the sound of your footsteps on soft earth.
*	*	*	*	*

When I heard that my inheritance included his house in the mountains, I planned on going there in a couple of months with some friends of mine from my auto technician school whom I had kept up with after I finished school. I was planning on having a good time hiking, drinking, and sitting around a fire dicking around.

Joey was five foot eleven inches and lanky. He had been going through a tough time dealing with some personal problems that I had been trying to help him through, even though we live halfway across the country from each other now. When he met me at the cabin, I noticed he looked like he lost some weight recently and my heart sank. When he moved away our other friends hadn't really stayed in touch like we did and he didn't have an easy time making new friends in the city he moved to. Making new friends as an adult is hard. He showed up around 11:00p.m. and I offered him a drink.

We walked into the living room, it was still mostly undecorated as I had thrown out most of my dead father‚Äôs old stuff. There was an old worn leather couch facing the fireplace, a dark wooden coffee table, a large accent chair matching the couch, a few stools lined up next to the bar dividing the kitchen from the living room, and a medium sized T.V. sat over the hearth. The cabin was dimly lit with warm light. My dog that I had brought with me from home, a Great Dane named Rosie, curled up on the couch, seizing half of it for herself. I walked over to the kitchen while Joey sat down and perused the liquor cabinet the old man had left to me. It seemed like one of the only things he had cared to spend money on and there was a costly selection at my disposal along with some nice crystal glasses. 

‚ÄúHey man, what's your poison of choice?‚Äô‚Äù I asked, looking over the array of options.

‚ÄúGot any tequila in there?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt know too much about tequila and there's a couple of kinds in here so you should come take your pick.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI'm a bourbon man myself.‚Äù

Joey looked over the bottles, found one to his liking, and pulled it down. We took our glasses and bottles over to the couch and drank and caught up for a while before calling it a night as Joey had gotten in pretty late and the others weren‚Äôt expected until tomorrow.

Daniel arrived late the next morning, waking us up by banging on the door. I made my way down the stairs quickly as his knocking sounded frantic and forceful. Each bang sounding violently through the cabin. Not helpful to my hangover.

‚ÄúFuck, man, I‚Äôm coming.‚Äù I shouted, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, ‚ÄúJesus, what's his deal?‚Äù I muttered to myself.

I reached the door and opened it to the continuous sound of his pounding on the door. Daniel, usually confident and unfazed, stood there disheveled and frightened, looking especially so because of his small frame. He was dirty, wearing blue jeans and a ripped white tee shirt that accentuated each dirt and grass stain on it. 

‚ÄúHoly shit man what happened to you?‚ÄùI asked, ‚Äúand where‚Äôs Sarah?‚Äù his girlfriend wasn't with him.

‚ÄúI don't know‚Ä¶ where‚Ä¶ she is,‚Äù he stammered between panicked breaths,‚ÄùThe car‚Ä¶ there was a deer‚Ä¶ Sarah was‚Ä¶driving‚Ä¶ we crashed into the woods.‚Äù

‚Äú The trees just‚Ä¶ closed in on us.‚Äù he said, questioning his own words.

Over the next ten minutes I managed to get the story out of him. Sarah had been driving, with him in the passenger seat of his little Ford Fiesta, when a deer jumped out from nowhere in front of the car. His girlfriend had swerved to avoid the deer and lost control, sending them off the road, down the steep embankment and into the woods. Somehow the car traveled miraculously far into the woods and hit a tree that seemed to knock Sarah unconscious. Daniel tried to get around to the other side of the car to try and see if he could drive it away but when he reached the other side there were bushes blocking his way to the door. He decided to run for help when he swears the plants in the forest tried to stop him. Trees bent down and branches reached for him, the brambles seemed to grow in his way and yank at his clothing and skin. He had left his cell phone in the car so he came straight here to call for help.

I gave him my phone to call an ambulance and woke up Joey. I relayed the story to him but said that I figured he had hit his head pretty hard in the crash and that the stuff with the plants was probably some kind of concussed hallucination. We all left to head down the road to the spot that Daniel said that the crash happened to flag down the ambulance when it came up the road.

When we got there I could see the Fiesta from the road and told them I would go to check on Sarah. Daniel protested and told me not to go in there but Joey and I told him it was going to be okay and I argued that they could see me from where they were standing while I made my way there.

I made my way down the steep roadside into the lush forest. I could see the Fiesta in front of me but something about it seemed off. It was silent in the woods.

‚ÄúSarah?‚Äù I shouted, making my way to the car.

There was no response. As I reached the car I slowed as a deep unsettling feeling washed over me. The car was covered in plant life as if it had been there for months. I walked to the side of the car and pulled the door open, ripping vines and moss from its way. 

Sarah wasn‚Äôt inside.

1hyq19i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hyq19i,Sudden Freedom ,"Recently, on a whim, I decided to take a solo trip to Darjeeling. The endless deadlines, meetings, and the constant tug-of-war between work and personal life had left me feeling drained. I needed a break‚Äînot the kind where you binge-watch shows on a weekend, but one where you disconnect, escape, and just exist. With no itinerary or plans, I packed a bag and boarded a train.

The moment I reached Darjeeling, I knew I had made the right decision. The sight of Kanchenjunga bathed in the first light of dawn, the crisp mountain air brushing against my face, and the quiet hum of life in the hills seemed to wash away all the chaos I‚Äôd been carrying within me. Watching the sunrise from Tiger Hill was a revelation. It wasn‚Äôt just nature‚Äôs beauty that mesmerized me; it was the realization that life‚Äôs true magic lies in these fleeting, unscripted moments.

For the first time in what felt like forever, I had no one to answer to. No buzzing phone, no deadlines, no expectations. It was just me, walking through tea gardens, sipping coffee in a small caf√©, and soaking in the stillness. I realized that this solitude wasn‚Äôt loneliness‚Äîit was freedom.

This trip taught me a simple yet profound truth: prioritizing yourself isn‚Äôt selfish, it‚Äôs essential. Taking a pause, listening to your own thoughts, and allowing yourself to simply ‚Äúbe‚Äù is not just a luxury but a necessity. Those few days in Darjeeling didn‚Äôt just show me the beauty of the mountains; they gave me a glimpse of a version of myself I hadn‚Äôt met in a long time.

I wanted to create a button that starts an 18-hour timer and displays a real-time countdown on my dashboard.
(It's for a cold brew coffee maker for my wife)

Steps Taken:
- Created a timer helper (timer.kitchen_timer) with a duration of 18 hours.
- Set up an input boolean helper (input_boolean.kitchen_timer_toggle) that triggers the timer when toggled.
- Configured an automation that starts the timer when the button is pressed, ensuring it doesn‚Äôt restart the timer if already running.
- tried to update a dashboard card to display the remaining time using a custom field.
- used a finishes_at attribute from the timer to calculate the remaining time in HH:MM:SS format.

Current Issue: 
Although the timer starts correctly and the initial time is displayed, the countdown is not updating dynamically in real-time.


What I am Trying to Achieve: 
I want the countdown to update every second if possible or at least every minute  on the dashboard without manual refreshes. The current solution calculates the correct remaining time but doesn't tick down. I tried using the custom timer card and that works but I don't want the bar just the timer part of it.

I've attached some pictures so you can see what I'm trying to do. The first photo is the current dashboard. The next photos show what I've accomplished so far and what happens before/after I click the timer. The timer sits at 17:59:59 until I manually refresh the page then it updates. I've also pasted in the snippet of code below that I've been trying to to make work. Any help would greatly be appreciated!

1hypxvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystoryemporium/comments/1hypxvh/trees_part_one/,Trees (part one?),"I am writing this here hoping to find some answers explaining my late fathers recent passing. After we found out that he had been cheating on our mother years ago among a slew of other things amounting to having a second family, we had basically cut ties with him altogether.I have not communicated with him since my senior year of highschool, almost a decade ago. I hadn't thought of him in years when a few months ago I got a call from someone informing me he had kicked the bucket.

As some strange way of trying to reconcile with us, my father had left everything he had owned to me and my sister, Robin. Robin tragically died a few years back in a drunk driving accident while in grad-school. She would have been a lawyer. That left me as the sole heir to my fathers inheritance. Turns out, life had not treated him so well in the years since he had left our family. His other family didn't take too kindly to my fathers antics once they heard from Robin who tracked them down on social media and informed them of his double life.

My father had been living alone for the majority of the last nine and a half years and had become somewhat of a shut-in. He had moved out to the middle of nowhere Washington, among the trees and sticks and lived an exceedingly solitary life, which is why it was so strange when he was found in the woods bordering his house, a mile away, with almost every bone in his body broken and bent at odd angles.His body was found by two middle age hunters who had been spotlighting that night and were unfortunate enough to come across this gruesome visual. My fathers body sprawled out, head facing up, his torso twisted around under the ribcage so that his hips were front side down and the skin around his waist was twisted and pulled tight, almost breaking. His left knee went the wrong way, his right ankle spun so that his foot was backwards, his leg bone broke the skin in some places, matching his arms and a couple of ribs so that his body formed a grizzly, crumpled mass of flesh, blood, and bone-spikes.

The hunters ran back in the way they came out of pure instinctual fear and adrenaline on seeing this cruel display of a violent end. When they reached a point where their phone had a signal one of them contacted law enforcement and alerted them to the situation. When the investigators arrived, the sun was just beginning to rise and a cool blue morning light dimly illuminated the scene through the trees. No one could make any sense of what had happened. It was clear to them via autopsy that he had only been dead for a couple of days at the point of being discovered. For some inexplicable reason,plants and grass had already begun to grow, wrapping his body. There was no rational explanation. The leading theory was that my sixty year old,unfit, father had scaled a very tall tree and flung himself down with enough force to do that amount of damage to himself, or that someone had done this to him and then carried his six foot, two hundred fifty pound body a mile into the woods and placed him here. There were no dragging or tire marks anywhere around the area. Animals had been ruled out because of the fact that there wasn‚Äôt a single bite mark or claw mark anywhere on his body. It was utterly dumbfounding to everyone who witnessed it.

The woods around his body seemed slightly unsettling to investigators and law enforcement who spent time there. Everything seemed very manicured and deliberate. The trees seemed too evenly spaced, the leaves and pine needles covered the ground too well. There was no breeze. Nothing moved. Above all there was a distinct, noticeable, silence, the only sound you could hear was your breath and the sound of your footsteps on soft earth.
*	*	*	*	*

When I heard that my inheritance included his house in the mountains, I planned on going there in a couple of months with some friends of mine from my auto technician school whom I had kept up with after I finished school. I was planning on having a good time hiking, drinking, and sitting around a fire dicking around.

Joey was five foot eleven inches and lanky. He had been going through a tough time dealing with some personal problems that I had been trying to help him through, even though we live halfway across the country from each other now. When he met me at the cabin, I noticed he looked like he lost some weight recently and my heart sank. When he moved away our other friends hadn't really stayed in touch like we did and he didn't have an easy time making new friends in the city he moved to. Making new friends as an adult is hard. He showed up around 11:00p.m. and I offered him a drink.

We walked into the living room, it was still mostly undecorated as I had thrown out most of my dead father‚Äôs old stuff. There was an old worn leather couch facing the fireplace, a dark wooden coffee table, a large accent chair matching the couch, a few stools lined up next to the bar dividing the kitchen from the living room, and a medium sized T.V. sat over the hearth. The cabin was dimly lit with warm light. My dog that I had brought with me from home, a Great Dane named Rosie, curled up on the couch, seizing half of it for herself. I walked over to the kitchen while Joey sat down and perused the liquor cabinet the old man had left to me. It seemed like one of the only things he had cared to spend money on and there was a costly selection at my disposal along with some nice crystal glasses. 

‚ÄúHey man, what's your poison of choice?‚Äô‚Äù I asked, looking over the array of options.

‚ÄúGot any tequila in there?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt know too much about tequila and there's a couple of kinds in here so you should come take your pick.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI'm a bourbon man myself.‚Äù

Joey looked over the bottles, found one to his liking, and pulled it down. We took our glasses and bottles over to the couch and drank and caught up for a while before calling it a night as Joey had gotten in pretty late and the others weren‚Äôt expected until tomorrow.

Daniel arrived late the next morning, waking us up by banging on the door. I made my way down the stairs quickly as his knocking sounded frantic and forceful. Each bang sounding violently through the cabin. Not helpful to my hangover.

‚ÄúFuck, man, I‚Äôm coming.‚Äù I shouted, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, ‚ÄúJesus, what's his deal?‚Äù I muttered to myself.

I reached the door and opened it to the continuous sound of his pounding on the door. Daniel, usually confident and unfazed, stood there disheveled and frightened, looking especially so because of his small frame. He was dirty, wearing blue jeans and a ripped white tee shirt that accentuated each dirt and grass stain on it. 

‚ÄúHoly shit man what happened to you?‚ÄùI asked, ‚Äúand where‚Äôs Sarah?‚Äù his girlfriend wasn't with him.

‚ÄúI don't know‚Ä¶ where‚Ä¶ she is,‚Äù he stammered between panicked breaths,‚ÄùThe car‚Ä¶ there was a deer‚Ä¶ Sarah was‚Ä¶driving‚Ä¶ we crashed into the woods.‚Äù

‚Äú The trees just‚Ä¶ closed in on us.‚Äù he said, questioning his own words.

Over the next ten minutes I managed to get the story out of him. Sarah had been driving, with him in the passenger seat of his little Ford Fiesta, when a deer jumped out from nowhere in front of the car. His girlfriend had swerved to avoid the deer and lost control, sending them off the road, down the steep embankment and into the woods. Somehow the car traveled miraculously far into the woods and hit a tree that seemed to knock Sarah unconscious. Daniel tried to get around to the other side of the car to try and see if he could drive it away but when he reached the other side there were bushes blocking his way to the door. He decided to run for help when he swears the plants in the forest tried to stop him. Trees bent down and branches reached for him, the brambles seemed to grow in his way and yank at his clothing and skin. He had left his cell phone in the car so he came straight here to call for help.

I gave him my phone to call an ambulance and woke up Joey. I relayed the story to him but said that I figured he had hit his head pretty hard in the crash and that the stuff with the plants was probably some kind of concussed hallucination. We all left to head down the road to the spot that Daniel said that the crash happened to flag down the ambulance when it came up the road.

When we got there I could see the Fiesta from the road and told them I would go to check on Sarah. Daniel protested and told me not to go in there but Joey and I told him it was going to be okay and I argued that they could see me from where they were standing while I made my way there.

I made my way down the steep roadside into the lush forest. I could see the Fiesta in front of me but something about it seemed off. It was silent in the woods.

‚ÄúSarah?‚Äù I shouted, making my way to the car.

There was no response. As I reached the car I slowed as a deep unsettling feeling washed over me. The car was covered in plant life as if it had been there for months. I walked to the side of the car and pulled the door open, ripping vines and moss from its way. 

Sarah wasn‚Äôt inside.





First attempt at writing a story, I may add more parts if it is received well, if not, enjoy the ambiguous ending lol.

1hypxt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FengShui/comments/1hypxt4/just_a_mirror_it_can_be_a_troublemaker/,Just a Mirror? It can be a Troublemaker,"So, I was having a chit-chat online with my girlie the other day, and she was going through a rough patch. It started with a few minor annoyances ‚Äì a flat tire here, a spilled coffee there. But then things escalated. Arguments with her husband, a lost job opportunity, even her beloved cat, seemed to be under a cloud of misfortune. She said that she felt like walking under a ladder. I kinda worried about her and decided to drop by her house. 

Then, something clicked. I saw a large mirror in her bedroom, the one directly facing her bed. I asked cautiously, ""honestly i think the mirror might not be the best placement? you know, it might affects the energy‚Ä¶"" She gave me a sheepish grin. ""Oh, that Feng Shui stuff? I didn't think much of it at the time."" I gently explained again how mirrors can reflect energy, and how having one facing your bed can disrupt your sleep and amplify any anxieties you might be experiencing. ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll try.‚Äù Intrigued, since things can‚Äôt be worse. She tried to cover the mirror with a beautiful scarf. And guess what? Within a week, things started to improve. The arguments subsided, a new job opportunity presented itself, and her mischievous feline companion, seemed to have regained her playful spirit.

I know sometimes it‚Äôs quite hard to balance the design and fengshui. but the simple placements can be adjusted. Except affecting energy, waking up at night, especially in a dazed state, can cause frightening illusions from the mirror. Over time, this can lead to mental disturbance, illness, and may affect marital relationships. so just cover it if you don‚Äôt want to relocate the mirror. Btw avoid looking at mirrors late at night. it‚Äôs not only buz you might be freaked out. Looking into a mirror after midnight can reflect negative energy, disturb your balance, and make you feel disoriented, with women being more affected.",1,1736576900.0,FengShui,1,1.0,False
1hypxjv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hypxjv,Fan art: Green Toast ID ,"I held out on buying a phone case for a while, and I‚Äôm so glad I did! I found this case on sale at Loft for 1,000 yen, snd it just screamed Y2K/Keep It Weird vibes. The case originally came with an iridescent/aurora sheet, which I used as a template to make my own. 

First, I traced the sheet on orange construction paper to serve as my template. I used Sakura Acryl Gouache for painting. I love this paint because it‚Äôs opaque, and it covers everything. My only regret is not using more expensive paper because painting on construction paper resulted in some warping. You can‚Äôt really tell after I‚Äôve cut out the art and applied it. 

This is fan art that I have created as a nod to the green toast/purple toaster bumper from the mid 90. It‚Äôs based on a popular 500 yen breakfast in Nagoya, Japan from a local chain called Komeda‚Äôs coffee, where you get coffee, toast and your choice of ogura (red bean paste), scrambled egg, or boiled egg. 

It‚Äôs not a new concept art, but rather just a quick redraw from a previous project. I‚Äôll link it in the comments because I can‚Äôt add multiple pieces of media in the OP. This is my first painting of 2025. 

I love this idea because if I ever get tired of the art on my phone, I can just swap it out for a new one. I have included the box art for anyone who wants to find the phone case first themselves. ",12,1736576869.0,ytvretro,2,1.0,False

Education & Profession:
I have a Bachelor‚Äôs in Software Engineering and currently work as a software engineer in Sydney, Australia.


A Little About Me:
I was born and raised in the UAE and I have spent much time in Pakistan tbh, originally from Punjab. These days, I‚Äôm living the Sydney life, balancing my tech career with my love for the outdoors(I know it's quite cliche ü§£). I‚Äôm a practicing Muslim who doesn‚Äôt smoke, drink, or do drugs. I‚Äôd call myself a coffee addict and an adventurous soul who enjoys camping, hiking, fishing, and long walks. I also love gaming when I‚Äôm not exploring the great outdoors. Romantic at heart, I value honesty, love, and strong family connections.


Family:
I come from a Punjabi family with two older brothers, one younger brother, and my amazing mom and dad. We‚Äôre big on supporting each other and value good vibes all around.


Where I Live:
I currently reside in Sydney and family in Pakistan lives in Punjab.


Religion:
I am a practicing Muslim as I pray all the prayers and have done umrah multiple times in my life. I keep all my fasting in order aswell and hopefully you are aligned on the same level as me.


What I‚Äôm Looking For:
I‚Äôm looking for someone who is kind, beautiful in her own way, and amazing to be around. A partner who values family, has a positive outlook on life, and enjoys the little adventures. Bonus points if you love coffee and are up for camping or fishing trips!


Deal Breakers:
I don‚Äôt get along with overly emotional or cold personalities, and I‚Äôd prefer someone with no major family issues. Excessive male friendships or negativity in relationships are also not my vibe. I don't mind if you had past relationships as long as you have overcome it.


My Timeline:
I‚Äôm hoping to take the plunge in about 1-2 years. In the meantime, I‚Äôd love to get to know the right person and grow together. The reason for this is that I wish to build my financial situation a bit more and then get married.


Why You Should Say Yes:
If you‚Äôre someone who wants a romantic, caring, and supportive partner who can cook almost everything, I‚Äôm your guy. I‚Äôll always prioritize our happiness, keep the spark alive, and make sure life feels like an adventure we‚Äôre on together.

Ever since then, I can't help but feel gross.

Another reason for the breakup is because I'm bisexual and would like to explore that. She said when we got together that if I feel like ""being gay"" that she'll be sad, but she'll let me move on. I could always use that excuse, but I feel like she deserves to know the truth.

Now, for the conflict. Her mom and brother are getting evicted because her landlord is a lying [REDACTED] so, they got no other place to go but to my girlfriend's and my place. And, we're currently packing to move to a better town for my girlfriend to live since her providers won't be coming by our current town anymore due to not enough staff.

We haven't chose a place to move to yet, but we're definitely going to be moving within the next month or so. So, I feel like it's a bit too late to breakup.

I care for her, I do. But, now I feel really gross. She acts her age just fine, but she does have Autism and I hate to breakup for something that she can't control (I didnt mean to come off a cruel, if I did, I'm Autistic, too).

As for the Nicola fight, it took me some trys but I got good. It's sweet how he became a super fighting robot just like he wanted. As well as a knight to protect his sister. I found it sweet how Mia called Nicola her little knight, especially since she realized he did all this to protect her. Made me happy I recovered his memory, Mia went through hell to get so far. She deserved a happy ending, even to an extent. I think what I'm really happy about is that due to the Finn gift I can finally give Lok an Ice swordsman build, but then again I've been using waited weapons alot so maybe I should do a heavy build.

1hypraj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hypraj/worried_about_a_lack_of_experience_ruining_my/,Worried about a lack of experience ruining my chances.,"I feel kind of silly even writing this, but I figure it's worth a shot.

I (28 M) matched with someone (27 F) on Hinge just before Christmas. The conversation flowed well and we met up for a coffee date last week. I really enjoyed myself and told her as such, to which she said she felt the same. We've set up a dinner date next week and I'm both thrilled and nervous as anything.

Now the reason I'm posting is because I'm horribly concerned about what comes next. To cut a long story short, I've had a somewhat sheltered life, and not much in the way of experience with romantic partners. Only in the last year have I actually felt comfortable enough to go out on dates, and I've yet to even share a kiss, let alone be intimate with anyone.

I've not brought this up with her of course, but I'm wondering how I can prepare for further dates with the looming threat of having to explain my lack of a resume so to speak.

Any advice would be appreciated 

TLDR: I don't know much about dating, and I don't want my inexperience to ruin my chances with someone I quite like.",1,1736576166.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
