1gpu4ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1gpu4ef/which_rug_under_sofa/,Which rug under sofa?,"I just bought a very nice and modern minimalist style sofa and looking at two different rugs that are complete opposite in style/design. Which rug do you think would look best? Coffee table and my TV stand also included to help picture of the pieces together. I haven't decided on end tables yet but am really leaning on tree stump style end tables.

I really like earth-tones and anything that reminds me of nature but with a sprinkle of modernity and clean minimalist look. Simple yet interesting and unique. Not too over the top but not boring to look at either.

It's noted as yellow on the sight and I would probably describe this as a more brown-toned mustard yellow.

These are the two rugs I'm thinking about:

And second rug. This is the ""pink"" version but the picture from manufacturer is definitely saturated.

This is the coffee table I intend to purchase with the sofa. Haven't purchased yet but definitely will. I like the simplicity but interesting shape. The color is very nice too and think it will brighten up the room a bit. Also think this table will compliment either of the two rugs.

I'm also 26 with no formal job experience. I've been dependent in a relationship that's lasted 6 years and lived in a place with no job prospects for me for the last 2. Worried myself sick with a father fighting his addiction with heroin. It's been...so hard to say the least. 

A friend of mine offered to let me stay with her 6 months ago for a little while to find work and save up for an apartment. I wasn't ready then but after some deep introspection and going to therapy every other week I decided I was going to bite the bullet. I'm in so much emotional pain though. And I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. 

Every day is a battle against my anxiety and depression. Since I've been here for a little under 2 weeks, I've forced myself to go for walks and take little trips to a coffee shop or bookstore. I'm nearly agoraphobic now after spending month after month inside of my home. My hands sweat like crazy and I can hardly raise my voice enough for people to understand. I'm fighting to look people in the eyes.

I'm also heartbroken because I want to go home so badly to where I feel safe. But I think my relationship is unhealthy for me no matter how much that hurts to admit. My partner hates going out in public and I've watched it get even worse after covid. I lost myself to this relationship because I caved and stayed in with him until that's all I did anymore. I feel alienated for a lack of better words. I wish that when I had graduated with a degree in 2022 I had thought harder about my future instead of hoping it will all come to me in time. 

I dont know what the future looks like for me but I know I have to amount to more than this. Not being able to stand on my own two feet as an adult has been crushing in terms of connecting with people. I've just never felt less understood out here. My friend has blabbed to her others friends about my situation a bit and it makes me even more self conscious when I see them. I don't want to be pitied. 

All I can do is take it one step at a time. Apply for jobs every day and hope for the best. Be grateful for what I have now. I'm so scared but I've been scared my whole life already. ",1,1731442020.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.99,False

I have a male work friend and earlier he came over. This was a huge mistake on my part and I think I shouldn't have done it. But nothing happened. He was just passing by and stopped to give me the charger I left at the office. So I invited him for a coffee. My husband returned home, as he was out with friends too. My coworker left and he started asking me questions and telling me I disrespected him by bringing the guy here. But in front of him he didn't act weird. He was friendly, they talked and joked around.

 The conflict between us got worse, we both raised our voices. In the end he slapped me so hard that I had marks on my cheek for more than one hour. All his fingers. I got genuinely terrified and simply stormed out the house and went to my father.

I didn't tell him what happened, just that we had a big fight. My father never liked him and tried to talk me out of this relationship. But his only reasons were that he will be away a lot and after we have children I will live like a single mother. So, I don't want to discuss it with him in details. I already got 10 texts from my husband asking me to come home, that he will not hurt me. But we need to talk. I told him that he should come here, that my father doesn't know what happened, but I don't want to go home now. He insist I have to and doesn't want to come to my dad's house.

I don't know what to do next. To tell my father, to go home? I genuinely love him and I am already 30, he is 37 and the whole idea of a divorce at this age and starting over terrifies me.

Last week when I was scrolling reddit I stumbled upon this sub, since then I have been seeing many posts like: (a)Introvert need advice or (b)Need advice on how to ask someone out or (c)Need advice on how to build confidence etc etc.

So here is my advice on how to approach women and make connections:

The most Important thing: **'THE WOMAN YOU APPROACH SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE AT ALL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION'.**

(A)Fitness - Look Presentable.

* A normal toned body is fine. I am not saying that you must have 6 pack abs and greek god jawline, but you shouldn't have a pot belly or triple chin where you look like sumo wrestler. A normal toned body is fine.

(B)Clothing - Dress appropriate.

* No flashy colours, no funky styles, not too much jewellery.
* An Ideal outfit would be Polo T-shirt, Chinos, Belt, Oxford Shoes, Watch and a Ring or a Bracelet. Always use a fragrance(perfume not deodorant), a great budget fragrance is Yardley Duke.
* If you're extremely handsome and confident then you'll do fine even if you're wearing a vest, shorts and flip-flops, but a well dressed man commands respect.

(C)Talking - Know how to converse.

* The crux is to be confident and make people feel comfortable during conversation. If you're interested in learning more then I'll suggest you two books: 1. Crucial Conversations and 2. How to make friends and Influence People.

(D)For Introverts - Build Confidence. But how?

* Don't approach women, approach men with intention of complimenting them; approach 10 men and just say: Hello, I was passing by, and I must say that your shoes are absolutely immaculate(or your clothing sense is absolutely immaculate). Say this and don't wait for a reply, immediately follow up with - 'Have a nice day' and leave. This exercise will build up your confidence so much.

(E)Where to approach women -

* In a casual setting and where the person who you're approaching feels comfortable. Cafes, Malls, Parks, Supermarket are ideal places to approach someone. Clinics, Gym, Workplace are places where you shouldn't approach.

(F)How to approach women -

Let's say that you're at a Cafe and you find someone attractive, go up to her an say: Hello, I was sitting faraway but I couldn't contain myself to talk to you; I must say that you have a really nice energy.

Observe her body language, if she is hesitant then say 'Have a nice day' and leave. If she is talking to you then continue. Remember that the most Important thing is that: **'THE WOMAN YOU APPROACH SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE AT ALL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION'.**

* Then, make a casual creative statement related to her, for example: If she is gym clothes then ask her - are you interested in fitness? If she has worn a woven sweater then ask her - is kneading clothes a hobby of yours? If she is reading a book then ask her - What genre of books do you like? If you can't find anything then say: What type of coffee/juice are you drinking?(If you're at Cafe) or What are you going to shop today?(If you're at Mall/Supermarket) or Do you love taking walks in nature?(If you're at a Park). She'll reply: Latte or Americano or whatever. Then reply: I love Latte or Americano or whatever she says.(Likewise reply accordingly for Mall/Supermarket and Park).

The goal here is to build a tiny connection, and this small talk also shows you whether she is comfortable or not; which is most important. Signs like: Not looking at you while talking, Giving one word answers, Walking away/backwards shows you that she isn't comfortable, if that's the case then you say 'Have a nice day' and leave. If she is talking to you then you continue:

* Continue with: I really like your vibes and I feel like there is a connection between us, I would like to take you out for a coffee sometime, can I have your phone number?

Either she will give you her number or she will be hesitant to do that. If she gives you her number then say 'See you later, have a nice day' and leave. If she is hesitant then say: 'Have a nice day' and leave. **DO NOT KEEP ASKING FOR HER NUMBER.**

(G)What Next? -

* Send her a text the next day, text something creative and personal; for example if she was reading a book when you met her then say: 'Did you complete the book you were reading yesterday?' or if she was drinking coffee then say: 'How many Lattes you've had today?'

And then let the conversation flow from there on, don't overthink your replies. Text her with the intention of taking her on a date.

(H)3 Date Rule:

* Do not go on a 3rd Date with someone who you are not interested in or with someone who is not interested in you, you don't want to waste time -not yours and not theirs.

Depending on how good-looking you are and how confident you are; Ideally we are looking at 20 to 30 phone numbers per 100 approaches. It's a numbers game, the more you approach the better your chances of finding the right one.

I'm 27, EST time zone, and I am from the state of New Jersey in the USA.

**Below is a list of my goals for this year (the next 365 days). However, I am only working towards only 1 goal (or area of my life) at a time.** You cannot change your whole life and all your habits overnight. I learned that the hard way.... smh. It is best to focus on improving one area of your life at a time. Right now I'm focused on goal #1 and I am succeeding at the moment (as of Day 10) but **I could really use a great accountability partner that's also super passionate about building a great life. It would be great to discuss our progress and our failures, encourage one another, problem solve specific issues together, have meaningful conversations about a wide variety of things relevant to self-growth, and perhaps compete together in fitness, academic, or financial challenges.**

**Current Goals From November 2024-November 2025 \[Subject to Revision Over Time\]**

**1.** **Eat 100% Healthy** and Follow my Nighttime Routine Every Night!  
**2. Start applying for marketing jobs**  
**3.** **Move to a new city for a marketing job** \*(\****I'm currently living with my parents in the middle of nowhere:*** *semi-rural, nothing to do, no culture, no university, no events, no scenes, nothing.)*  
**4. Start dating again:** Politely, and gentlemanly ask any single woman you find attractive, that you see in public or at the gym or at an event, and ask her if she'd like to grab a cup of coffee for a casual date after testing the waters first with some playfulness and then flirting a bit if she seems interested in talking to me. I got a lot of dates and girlfriends doing that in the past. *(And use Tinder again, I suppose?)*  
**5. Find a girl I could earnestly fall in love with and who could potentially be ""the one""** and ask her to be my girlfriend after she drops a hint that she wants a relationship  
**6. Get in the best physical shape of my entire life**  
**7 Follow the Bulletproof Diet starting next month**  
**8. Quit vaping**  
**9. Start reading books again** and summarizing what you learned afterwards on video to improve recall (the best way to learn is to teach, since explaining something you learned brings it all together in your mind)  
**10. Build the best support structure possible for my self-improvement:** Find about 4-5 friends who are kindred spirits: all aiming up in life while sharing our successes and failures, our insights and ideas, and all of whom inspire me to become my best self... my real self! And I wish to do the same for them since I have so many great insights on how to optimize performance in every area of life! From books about biohacking to how to establish and maintain healthy relationships, I've studied a great deal of things that will help me achieve success faster and more effectively than one might imagine. 

**My Story:** I've been into lifelong self-improvement for 15 years but got wrecked pretty badly by a terrible, horrific codependent relationship with a girl that threatened to unalive herself if I broke up with her, and so I stayed with her for 5 years trying to ""fix her."" It was hell. I was depressed and stopped taking care of myself because I felt trapped. Don't ever date a ""project"" regardless of how ""hot she is"" in terms of her physical appearance or how she's really a nice person that deserved better in life but got screwed up by her parents, or lack thereof. That shit means nothing if they just tear you down instead of lifting you up. Women with mental health or alcohol need a therapist, a mentor, and to take responsibility for their own lives; not someone to fix their problems for them so they don't have to become an adult and outgrow their codependency issues. Don't repeat my mistakes. You can't ""fix"" another person. Even therapists don't fix people; they just give people the tools they need to work on themselves. The same is true of AA, although AA also offers a community of people willing to help you.",1,1731441331.0,GetMotivatedBuddies,0,1.0,False

(Sorry this got a little longer than i wanted. The language is a little hard to understand.)

I'm 16(AFAB). Me and my mum have always had a good relationship. She has raised 8 children before me and I was her youngest and her last, so she doted on my every move.

I've known since I was little that my mum wasn't the best person, and grew up in relative poverty where only my dad worked and our house was in tatters, but no matter what my mum was there for me. She was my rock and I loved her more than anything. 

But we moved houses when i was young, and my older sister (second youngest girl, fourth youngest altogether, and born from a one night stand) reached her rebel phase and was running away for reasons i didn't know then but understand now. This was the first time I ever saw my mum put her hand on any of her children, and I was only 9. 
Despite this I still loved her so much and I never thought anything of it.

These recent years though, she's been having some health problems caused by her diabetes and her smoking. At first she just struggled to walk and was put on pills, but then early this year (like January) she had her first stroke of many and was hospitalised. My dad had to pay for all her food since she wouldn't eat any of the hospital meals, and he blew all the money he got after winning a lawsuit that he had been waiting on for a year. 
This was during my preliminary exams, and I felt so stressed not being able to come home straight away and see her. Luckily she got out and was fine, but we learned she had blood clots and they could possibly affect how she behaves.
We didn't notice it though. We thought everything was fine.

Then, just at the start of summer after I turned 16, she had another stroke. And she became paralysed on her left side. She had some ability to move her leg but zero ability to move her arm.
I never went out during the summer because my dad would take us up to see her every day and I live too far away from my friends to only spend an hour with them. Absolutely everything was horrible, the whole summer mightve been my worst experience.
And when we learned she was getting released, the doctors very briefly spoke about how we'd have to care for her. We'd have to change her, wash her, pull up her pants, etc. I was so scared, and rightfully so.

These past months with my mum have been absolutely terrible. The strokes messed with her brain and she has became an incredibly cruel woman. My older family don't understand since they don't live here, but me my two brothers and my sister I mentioned before have had full blown vent sessions because of how stressed she makes us. I think I've sobbed over how she treats me more times these months than I've cried ever. 

Me and my sister are the only girls, but all my sister really does is cook and wash her. I have to do everything for my mum from changing her, brushing her hair, cleaning her nails, to pulling her pants up, changing her when she dribbles etc. I've seen her lady parts way too intimately. I've had two panic attacks in the middle of shopping just for her to yell at me despite the fact I'm halfway through changing her in a disabled toilet while people rattle on the door to get in because she didn't tell us she had to pee and did it in the street.

It's gotten to the point my sister says the only reason she stays is because she doesn't want to leave me with her. My brothers are alot more pliant and just do what she says with some minor protest, but I get so angry and just lash out. She has hit my sister twice now since her second stroke. I had to pull her away the second time and I ended up sobbing in my room afterwards before going back to the dishes and acting like nothing happened. I feel like she sees my sister in me and gets angry everytime I speak up to her like she would have at my age.

Being around her makes me feel sick. She actually repulses me. She stinks and has showered a total of around 10 times since she first came back from the hospital because whenever my sister asks her if she wants to get bathed she finds a way to ignore it. She recently shaved all her hair off because she never let us brush it since she let it get extremely matted while in the hospital. Every time I touch her I need to wash my hands for atleast 2 minutes because I feel so dirty. I can't even step into her room without gagging, and I was sick the first time I took notice of the smell. It doesn't help since I change her and am the only one who knows how to put her strap on her arm. The smell ferments on everything she owns, and I can't lay in her bed or wear her baggy shirts anymore because the idea of it makes me shake.

My mum isn't even trying to get better. She keeps saying she's grieving because my auntie died early September but all I cant think is ""so is everyone else."" And I can't imagine my auntie wanting my mum to be this way (she also struggled with things like this. She experienced psychosis and would have episodes where she was abusive towards her son, but she improved herself and became a lovely woman.). When we thought she was improving she had another stroke and then another while in the hospital. I feel like nobody but the people who live with me are on my side. All my siblings defend her especially my eldest and they all just lecture us about our house being a pigsty and how we don't even know how to take care of ourself. But like, me and my 2 brothers actually weren't taught how to do things. My mum babied us to the point this past year I've had to learn how to cook, do washing, iron, wash dishes, etc. Nobody taught me anything. My mum can do some things like make coffee and tea and sometimes food, but she actively doesn't. She uses the excuse that her arm is too sore and then is up and making hot coco for herself less than 10 minutes later. It gets tiring having to make her a whole meal and drinks every single time she wants some.

I feel so humiliated and pathetic because I never thought I'd feel this way but I hate her. I used to sob myself to sleep thinking about her dying but now it feels like I've already lost her and as horrible and selfish and insane as it sounds I wouldn't be distraught if she did. I'd cry alot, but I think I'd come to terms with it quicker than anyone in my family. Actually I've became 10x closer to my dad since she's been like this and am around him at any opportunity. My family are in even worse Poverty than before and it doesn't help my mums houses only income are benefits from the government. We've gone without food because she wants cigarettes so many times it's scary. 

I'm used to my mum guilt tripping me into feeling bad for her as she has said things like ""You hate me, don't you?"" ""Sorry I'm a terrible mother."" Since I was a little girl but now she says things like ""I bet you wish I died in the hospital"" and honestly sometimes I think I do. Life runs so much easier when she isn't around. I feel so disgusting saying these things but they're my honest thoughts. She even once told me (recently) that she tried to kill herself in the hospital. I wasn't even mad at her then because I just felt so sad imagining how she must be feeling losing all her independence, but I don't even think she actually cares. I know I'm sick but I had to say these things because I have noone to talk to not even my sister I mentioned, I've told her I feel like I've already grieved my mother but I can't even touch upon wishing she was out of my life. I just want my mum back and I never will and I don't know how to deal with it. My dad expects me to stay at home when I go to college but if she's still alive or living there I'm moving out as soon as I can. I refuse to become like my siblings and let this woman destroy my self esteem.  Recently my sister has been telling me about how there are things I don't know about my mum that she can't tell me until I'm older because they will completely change my perception of her, but I don't think it gets lower than this. I think I might hate her.

(As I was finishing this she called me into her room to find the cigarettes she dropped and oh my god her bedside is so disgusting I had to leave the room. She got mad at me because I told her I didn't want to touch whatever was under there and my brother had to come. Honest to god I think she has caused me to become so aware of things being gross, I get icked out extra easy I can't even let her make me food and don't care when she screams at me for taking that away from her. She doesn't wash her hands. Also just overheard her say to my sister ""christ, are you eating all of that?"" And continuously shame her despite her barely having food on her plate.)",1,1731441322.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

21.

Olivia sat nervously in the interview room of the police station where Morrison and Osterham had brought her. She knew that she hadn’t done anything wrong, but she still couldn’t help feeling a little bit like a criminal.

The FBI believed that it had identified John’s family. They wouldn’t say too much except that he *had* a family, and that they were looking for him, and that they required Olivia’s input in order to ensure that the situation was handled with the delicacy and discretion it required.

It had been made very clear that Osterham didn’t want her involved in the investigation beyond what she had already been, but Morrison and, apparently, their superiors had wanted to ‘read her in’ to see if she wanted to continue to be John’s advocate. She’d take all of two seconds to make her decision.

She had signed all of the NDAs that they had put in front of her, never once questioning why they were being so secretive until after all the paperwork was signed and she was waiting to speak with the agent in charge of the investigation.

She sipped the crappy jailhouse coffee that Morrison had left with her and waited patiently. Trying to ignore the part of her that thought she looked like she belonged in a scene from *Law and Order*.

Eventually the door opened, and a woman came in. She was middle aged. Tired looking, and wearing the uniform of a Major in the Earth Space Force. Olivia frowned to see a military officer – especially one that was part of the international cooperative forces that were tasked with defending Earth from extraterrestrial threats. The woman, however, seemed pleased to meet Olivia. They shook hands, and Major Mary Phillips introduced herself.

“I’m certain you’re wondering why the ESF is involved in this little operation,” Mary said once they had both taken a seat. “Before any of that, I would like to clarify something. You said that you couldn’t place John’s accent. I’d like you to listen to a recording and tell me if the accent is a match.”

The Major placed an egg-shaped object on the desk, and a hologram of a child with a sloped forehead appeared and began speaking in broken english. The child was bragging about her language studies and how hard she was working to learn the new Darkworld tongues. Several holograms flashed by providing a brief example of similar children making similar claims.

“I have to admit that yes, the accent sounds very similar to John’s,” she said after the fifth example. “I’m sorry, I’m just a little overwhelmed by the technology you just displayed, to be honest. Did we get that from the aliens?”

“Yes, doctor, we did,” Mary confirmed. “They’re shipping us these devices by the tens of thousands. We’re calling them PHDAs. Personal Holographic Data Assistants. They’re effectively alien cellphones with advanced communication features and holographic capabilities.”

“Remarkable. How long until that sort of technology makes it to the public?” Olivia asked.

For some reason, Mary made a face. “Anyway, Doctor Nunes, I am here to read you in to the situation in which you have unwittingly become involved. It is a very delicate and complex situation, and it requires a very soft touch. We are hoping that since you already have an established relationship with the subject, that you will consent to further involvement. There are state secrets involved, and I won’t be going into all of the information which we have on the subject, only that which we feel is necessary for you to make an informed decision.”

“John,” Olivia said. “Don’t call him ‘the subject.’ His name is John.”

“Okay, let’s start with that. We believe that his birth name is not John Doe. Obviously. We believe that his name is Eodar. And you may not believe this, Doctor Nunes, but we have significant reason to believe that Eodar is the clone of a hero from the wars which shaped the Yonohoan empire and that the aliens consider this child to be a significant cultural hero.”

“That’s absurd,” Olivia said immediately. “He’s not an alien he’s a human child. A twelve year old boy.”

“Yes ma’am. His DNA is a 99.7 percent match for modern humans,” Major Phillips agreed. “And it is a very very nearly 100% match for our records of Neanderthal DNA. The DNA sample taken from a member of his immediate family has proven paternity conclusively. John Doe is Eodar, no last name, of the Yonohoan people. A clone created using advanced technology that is illegal even by the aliens who possess it.”

Olivia wanted to scoff, but she forced herself to pause and look at the evidence. The claims of aliens in the solar system weren’t going away. She’d seen their technology first hand now. She calmed herself and forced her to reexamine the evidence from a new angle. She had initially assumed that John’s abnormal behaviors were evidence of a learning or neurological disorder. Then she had assumed that they were eccentricity related to his extremely high IQ.

“Okay, let’s say that I’m choosing to believe you for now,” Olivia said. “How did he get here, *why* is he here, and what do you need me for? I won’t consent to anything unethical, regardless of whether he’s a natural born citizen of Earth or not. As far as I’m concerned he’s a child and one that I have chosen to advocate for.”

“That’s exactly it, doctor. By Yonohoan standards and our own, John slash Eodar is a juvenile who can’t advocate for himself. He needs an advocate who is concerned only with his best interests. Because of your existing relationship and your professional qualifications, we are asking for you to step into that role.”

“Okay. I’m in,” Olivia said without any hesitation. “Now tell me everything that you believe you know about John so that I can start doing my new job.”

Mary nodded, impressed by the woman’s dedication to her chosen profession. “The fact is, Olivia, that we know that Eodar possesses memories of being conscripted to scout worlds like ours for a defunct military organization. He was trained, apparently from age four or younger, to infiltrate a society while posing as a child in order to gather intelligence. While the military that is responsible for this act has been disbanded for a very long time, it is likely that Eodar believes that it still exists and that he is on a mission to infiltrate Earth. One which he would have gotten away with, if it weren’t for us receiving key information from the Yonohoans.”

“You think he’s a spy,” Olivia said. “My god, what are you people planning? He’s just a kid.”

“Yes, we are aware of that. We are hoping to take him into custody and convince him of the fact that the war he was conscripted into has been over for a very long time. Unfortunately we don’t know what sort of training he possesses or what technology he has access to. The Yonohoans believe that he might be dangerous, and considering what they are capable of that implies that he poses a significant threat. We want to treat him with the dignity that a child-soldier deserves, but we also have to keep in mind public safety.

“The jet-like vehicle that he used to infiltrate earth is *still* burning in Washington. We have to assume that, despite the conditions in which he was found, he retains access to some sort of covert weaponry. For those reasons and several others we can’t allow him to simply remain in place. We have to bring him in. But we’re trying to come up with a plan that will take into account both his unique situation, and at the same time prevent any collateral damage.”

“He’s just a boy,” Olivia began to argue.

“If he really *is* just a boy then we’ll all look pretty foolish when this operation comes to light and it looks like we’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars preparing to interview an innocent child,” Mary agreed. “The fact remains that we *need* to interview him and we need to go into the interview assuming the worst case scenario. The last thing we need is an alien infiltrator perpetrating a school shooting or hostage situation because he feels that he has been backed into a corner.”

Olivia looked down at her coffe, which had grown cold. “Okay. I’m not entirely convinced. But I know by this stage that you’re going to do what you’re going to do no matter what that means for John. So how do I help him? What do you need me for?”

Mary smiled at her and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. “We’re not monsters, Olivia. We *want to help* Eodar. I view him as a victim, not a criminal. We just need to be prepared for any fallout if he decides that he doesn’t want our help and responds poorly to it.”

“Right. You’re right,” Olivia said. “So let’s go over it. How are things going to go down?”

Mary nodded, and she began explaining the plan in detail.",3,1731441230.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

A big deciding factor for a lot of the friendships ending was a former friend of mine (Apple) told all of my current friends that I had done something really fucked to manipulate them 10 months ago.  

I did not do this thing, this was the first time I'd heard them say I'd done this thing, and I had screenshots to show that they had NEVER brought this up to me as a problem in our friendship. There have been instances in the past where Apple has told people I did something that I didn't do and I've given my perspective of events and they are very very different than Apple's. They were smaller things and not anything close to what I was being accused of now.

My friends had no reason to doubt Apple and they all decided that Apple wouldn't lie and ended their friendship with me. It hurt a lot and I've had to really work on my mental health and I doubted myself a lot. That maybe I did do that fucked up thing and I just don't remember it or I didn't think it came across that way but it did. I've worked hard to get to a better place

Fast forward several months. My ex (Orange) comes into town. We ended things on decent terms like a year and a half ago, but haven't seen each other. So, we're going to get coffee as friends and catch up. 

The day we're to get coffee, I check in to make sure it's still happening and Orange let's me know that she wants to but isn't in a good place mentally as she just found out she was cheated on. Apple and Orange dated years before Orange and I dated. They broke up, remained good friends, and about a year after Orange and I split up, she started dating Apple again. 

During their first relationship, Apple cheated on Orange and then lied about it and has kept it a secret for literal years. They came clean to Orange recently and that's why I know about all of it. The friends who had no reason to doubt Apple? They are all now aware that Apple was lying for years. 

I'm not fucking crazy! Apple is a God damn liar and I feel so validated! I doubt any of my former friends will apologize or own up to the mistake, but I don't care. I don't need them in my life.

Because, **America's sociopathic 78 year-old toddler with a brain injury, who once made daily life feel like an unending fever dream is, once again, assembling his cabinet with all the finesse of a three-ring circus.** And the lineup? Think of it as a greatest hits compilation—if your greatest hits include racists, bigots, questionable ethics, and an utter disregard for integrity. Because why go for “new and improved” when you can opt for “questionable and compromised”?

That said, **the nagging question on my mind is, ""How many Scaramuccis will any of these picks last?""**

Anthony Scaramucci, the man, the meshuga, the briefest White House Communications Director ever, ran an impressive ten days—from July 21 to July 31, 2017—before he was unceremoniously kicked to the curb. Yes, that’s less than two weeks—the shelf life of a ripe avocado. To put it another way, that’s less time than it takes to get a passport expedited, or for your least favorite contestant to get dumped on “Love Island.” “The Mooch” barely had time to learn where the coffee machine was before he was out the door.

**""The twice-impeached, four-times-indicted, convicted of 34 felony counts, found liable of sexual assault disgraced ex-president""\* and failed QVC steak salesman's first term was a dizzying carousel of resignations, rage-quitting, and all-caps Tweet firings, with cabinet members barely unpacking their moving boxes before being shown the door.**

Now, with some of the names being tossed around, I wonder if the second term promises a repeat performance or if we’re entering uncharted territory of turnover records. Either way, **Maddow’s breakdown serves as a chilling reminder that the revolving door is already being prepped for round two. And if history repeats itself, the Scaramucci Scale might just become the yardstick of choice for political survival.**

My point is, with the auditions for *Who Wants To Be America’s Next Sycophantic B-Hole Licker* underway, I think one of the questions we should be thinking about is h*ow many Scaramuccis* they'll survive before they’re packing their desk tchotchkes and calling their publicist.

**""The Day the Stars Came Closer""**

When the news finally broke, it didn’t come in a dramatic, single announcement. Instead, it started with a quiet morning headline that went largely unnoticed: ""Pentagon Confirms Non-Human Craft Retrieval Program.""

At first, people brushed it off, thinking it was just more rumors or government mischief. But by evening, more information was leaked. Reports of nonhuman biological materials, stories from former officials, and slowly, an understanding began to settle over everyone—the universe was bigger, stranger, and much closer than they’d ever thought.  
  
In the small town of Unity, Iowa, life went on as usual, for the most part. People still went to work, cooked dinner, and dropped their kids off at school. But there was a new, electric current of curiosity and fear. Mrs. Calder, a 5th-grade science teacher, found her students asking about stars, the solar system, and whether “aliens” might have homework, too. She smiled, though inwardly, she wondered the same.

At the local diner, conversations drifted to the same topic. “So, there were UFOs all along?” people murmured over coffee cups, their gazes fixed on the TV above the counter, where news reporters tried to explain things they barely understood. Mr. Jensen, a mechanic in town, used to joke about UFOs. Now, as he fixed up an old car in his garage, he kept glancing at the sky, as if expecting a flash of light or a strange glimmer.

But the change went deeper than headlines. Around the world, scientists, religious leaders, and thinkers were thrown into debates and discussions that reshaped understanding itself.  
  
**""The Reckoning of the Stars""**

The world changed forever on Disclosure Day.

For most, it began as a series of leaks, sensational claims, and news segments that seemed, at first, like fiction or hype. The truth broke slowly, in fragments—a secretive special access program, decades of sightings hidden in military archives, and claims of recovered non-human biological materials. By the time governments and intelligence agencies confirmed the basics, reality had already started to fray.

In the days after Disclosure Day, as the implications sank in, the world's institutions faced a fundamental shift. At the center of it all was the revelation that the United States, alongside the Five Eyes Alliance—comprised of the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—had recovered and secretly studied the remains of extraterrestrial beings since the infamous Roswell incident. Documents released to the public detailed the timeline of these events, with each new date representing a previously hidden crash site, a retrieval, or a biological discovery.

This was more than the world had ever expected. Governments worldwide erupted with questions. Why had this information been withheld? What gave a handful of allied nations the right to guard secrets that impacted all of humanity?

Meanwhile, the United Nations held a historic emergency session. It was perhaps the first time the whole world truly felt united—nervous, intrigued, and fearful as diplomats from every nation huddled to discuss their common situation. They addressed urgent questions: Could these visitors from the stars be trusted? How should humanity respond? And what about the thousands of claims of alien abductions and sightings of unknown craft?

Reports and testimonies from decades were finally taken seriously: farmers in Canada and Argentina who’d found mutilated livestock; civilians in the American Midwest and Russian countryside who recalled losing hours, sometimes whole days, after witnessing strange lights; witnesses from India, Zimbabwe, Japan, and Ireland, each recounting eerie tales of “missing time” or waking to find strange marks on their bodies. These stories, once dismissed as delusions, were now part of a global reckoning. 

In Brazil, news helicopters flew over the Amazon basin, showing locals who gathered where strange lights had appeared for decades. On the ground, police and researchers were called to investigate mysterious crop damage that had long been dismissed as natural disasters. “They’re here,” muttered one villager as journalists questioned him, “and maybe they’ve always been.” In Australia, outback ranchers began to connect years of strange cattle deaths to the alien technology now in the open.

**Asia: A Resurgence of Belief and Fear**

In rural China, ancient myths of celestial beings took on a fresh life. Stories of dragons, visitors from the heavens, and otherworldly spirits resurfaced in media, mixing folklore with the current crisis. Meanwhile, in bustling cities, some welcomed the visitors, seeing them as a testament to human resilience and survival in a shared universe. Others, however, were wary. Would the aliens view humanity as anything other than a curious species? Would we face the fate of the cattle?

In India, spiritual leaders were divided. Some saw extraterrestrials as enlightened beings—manifestations of divine powers they had always spoken of. Temples held prayer ceremonies to welcome these “travelers.” But darker stories, circulating through rural communities, spoke of people vanishing after encountering lights on deserted roads or being visited at night. Abduction claims grew widespread, straining a government scrambling to reassure people.

**Europe: Historical Reassessments and the Shadow of Abduction**

In Europe, academics poured over historical records, uncovering strange accounts in medieval chronicles and Renaissance art that now seemed prescient. Researchers in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom debated the extent of alien involvement in human history. Museums set up exhibits with titles like *""The Cosmic Visitor: Ancient Encounters?""* while scientists published papers with eerie questions: Had humanity ever truly been alone?

For many, though, these revelations brought not only curiosity but horror. In Norway, the quiet mountain towns where UFO sightings had been frequent in the past saw spikes in people reporting missing animals, strange lights, and intrusive dreams. In Germany, a group of psychologists issued a public health warning about “abduction anxiety,” a condition they argued would only grow as more people claimed to have experienced inexplicable encounters.

**Africa: Traditional Knowledge and New Anxieties**

In South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, communities with longstanding beliefs in sky spirits and supernatural beings struggled with a mixture of pride and anxiety. Elders in rural areas recounted stories of “star visitors” passed down for generations. For some, disclosure was a moment of vindication—proof that their traditions were not mere myth.

Yet as alien encounters came to light, so did darker stories. Children in Zimbabwe reported being visited by strange beings who spoke of “coming changes.” In Ghana, cattle mutilations increased near military bases. Here, the old spiritual beliefs provided only limited comfort in the face of what now felt like a new, creeping threat.

**The Americas: From New Technologies to Paranormal Chaos**

In the United States, there was a national reckoning as stories of hidden government programs, cover-ups, and chilling encounters became common knowledge. Political leaders faced harsh criticism. “What else have they hidden from us?” became the rallying cry, and public sentiment was divided between fascination and fear. Conspiracy theorists saw vindication in claims of hidden technology and biological specimens. Meanwhile, reports of cattle mutilations, unexplained deaths, and nighttime encounters flooded police departments.

In Latin America, where beliefs in UFOs had long been part of local lore, some people responded with resignation. “They’re as real as the mountains,” an elderly woman in Mexico told reporters. But in the rural pampas of Argentina, where mysterious lights had plagued ranchers for decades, fear grew. Livestock turned up dead with strange wounds; some even reported finding human remains in remote fields, sparking talk of alien abductions and strange experiments.

**UN Initiatives: Global Measures and Cosmic Ethics**

The UN response was swift but cautious. An intergovernmental committee, *The Council for Extraterrestrial Interaction* (CEI), was formed to handle diplomatic responses, intelligence sharing, and civilian concerns. But CEI’s transparency fell short of calming the public. Leaks revealed concerns about protecting not just humanity but the visiting entities as well, sparking an ethical debate on rights—human, alien, or otherwise.

This was more than the world had ever expected. Governments worldwide erupted with questions. Why had this information been withheld? What gave a handful of allied nations the right to guard secrets that impacted all of humanity?

For many, the question of the aliens’ intentions loomed largest. Were they here to study, to help, or to control? A coalition of nations proposed a strict “no-contact” rule until motivations were clarified. But members of CEI argued for cooperation, citing potential technological advancements. Under their authority, labs worldwide were granted limited access to alien materials under strict guidelines, though the public was suspicious.

As the months passed, the excitement faded, leaving a divided world—half in wonder, half in fear. UFO sightings became a strange new normal, though sightings of familiar, ominous details—bloodless livestock, abductees with lost memories, eerie scars, and people who simply vanished—reminded everyone that humanity was no longer alone.



# The United Nations and Global Diplomacy

In response, the United Nations held what would become known as the *Global Contact Summit*—a series of emergency sessions attended by world leaders, scientists, military officials, and representatives from indigenous communities and religious institutions. The General Assembly’s chamber overflowed with an unprecedented diversity of perspectives, from skeptical diplomats to impassioned advocates for transparency.

Secretary-General Anwar Sahni called the meeting to order, her voice solemn as she addressed the Assembly: “We face a reality in which we are no longer the sole possessors of this planet, nor perhaps of this solar system. We must now reckon with the undeniable fact of extraterrestrial presence. But before we look outward, we must first look inward. Why were only a select few nations trusted with this information?”

Many of the UN’s members were furious. Representatives from nations across Asia, Africa, and Latin America demanded answers from the U.S. and its allies. They called for an immediate sharing of all alien biological data, crash-site details, and technological findings. As one representative from India remarked, “We share the same skies. We all have a right to the truth.”

To ease tensions, the Five Eyes Alliance revealed further records, including DNA analyses of alien remains, details of reverse-engineering programs, and data on craft performance characteristics that defied conventional physics. Still, the diplomatic chasm was widening; distrust, already high, reached new heights. Many nations worried that the Five Eyes had monopolized contact with extraterrestrial life and had possibly developed technologies the rest of the world was decades away from understanding.

# The World Health Organization: Alien Biology and Biosecurity

With public anxiety rising, the World Health Organization (WHO) took immediate action. WHO Director-General Amina Khouri issued a directive for all nations to establish alien biosecurity protocols. A commission of scientists and medical professionals was assembled to study the biological materials under high security. Reports of a mysterious “alien pathogen” that could theoretically jump to humans stoked fears of a new pandemic.

Across WHO labs, teams in hazmat suits worked around the clock, studying preserved tissues, microscopic cellular structures, and unusual biochemical compounds. In a leaked memo, one researcher described the cells as “strangely efficient,” capable of withstanding radiation and adapting to environmental changes in ways previously thought impossible.

Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies scrambled to patent extraterrestrial biomaterials, hoping to create revolutionary medicines. However, the WHO stepped in, issuing a statement that any extraterrestrial biological discoveries would be considered a global heritage and be subject to public oversight.

# The Vatican and Religious Communities: A Crisis of Faith and Opportunity

Religious institutions around the world struggled with the profound implications of Disclosure. The Vatican called for an emergency synod, drawing cardinals and theologians to Rome. They debated existential questions—were these beings also “children of God”? Could they have souls? The Pope addressed a global congregation, urging unity and compassion, though he admitted that “faith must now adapt to a universe more vast than we had ever dared imagine.”

In the Middle East, Islamic scholars discussed the implications of extraterrestrial life in the context of their faith. Many took a position of cautious openness, suggesting that the universe’s diversity might be an expression of divine creation. Buddhist leaders, too, embraced the revelation, seeing it as an extension of interconnected life.

However, not all communities were as accepting. In rural areas across South America, Africa, and parts of Asia, evangelical and traditionalist groups saw Disclosure as a challenge to their deeply held beliefs. These groups led protests, declaring the extraterrestrials “deceptive spirits” or “harbingers of the apocalypse.” In the United States, factions of conservative Christians and conspiracy theorists fueled fears of an impending alien takeover, stoking unrest.

But for every story of terror, there were whispers of cosmic possibilities. Scientists theorized that interspecies diplomacy could open doors to cures, to the stars, and to answers about the origins of life itself. Whether aliens were friend or foe remained unclear. Yet even as humanity questioned its place in a vast universe, one thing was certain: Earth would never be the same.  


# Scientific Societies and the Global Research Community: A New Frontier

The scientific community was, for the most part, elated. For the first time, top scientists from every continent had access to a treasure trove of alien technology and biological samples, some of which had properties never observed on Earth. Researchers were in awe of materials with qualities like self-repair, anti-gravity capabilities, and electromagnetic field manipulation.

The International Federation of Scientists (IFS), a coalition of Nobel laureates and researchers, was established to coordinate global research efforts. However, progress was stymied by the question of control. Some feared that the U.S. and its allies would continue to monopolize the most sensitive discoveries. Protests erupted at scientific conferences, as researchers demanded unrestricted access to the findings.

To resolve these conflicts, the UN proposed the establishment of a *Global Institute for Extraterrestrial Studies* (GIES), an international laboratory with open access to extraterrestrial data. Nations like Russia, China, and India signed on immediately, while the U.S. and its allies hesitated, wary of sharing technology that could potentially be weaponized. However, mounting pressure forced their hand, and the GIES was established in Geneva with a mandate for transparency and shared access.

# The Five Eyes Admission and Its Fallout

When the Five Eyes Alliance finally admitted to possessing bodies of alien pilots and decades of crash retrievals, the world reaction was explosive. In Japan, an otherwise peaceful protest turned into riots when the public learned that even their government had been left in the dark. Across Europe, people questioned whether their governments were complicit or merely ignorant.

In South America, where sightings had been common but dismissed by officials, there was a sense of betrayal. Leaders in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile demanded full access to the data, stating that “no single nation has the right to hold secrets from the stars.” African and Southeast Asian leaders echoed these demands, insisting that discoveries about extraterrestrial life belonged to all of humanity.

Facing global backlash, the Five Eyes were forced to establish an oversight council with representation from other nations. This council was tasked with monitoring future encounters, enforcing transparency, and ensuring no single nation could monopolize extraterrestrial resources. It was a reluctant concession, and the U.S. and its allies fought hard to retain control over the council’s operations, but the push for democratized alien knowledge grew too strong to ignore.

# Life in the Pre-Contact World: Tensions, Aspirations, and Dread

As the world adjusted to this knowledge, society continued its struggle with the profound consequences. People in every nation began experiencing a sense of collective anticipation, an unease that humanity was on the brink of unprecedented change. The sense of a “pre-contact world” settled in—a time when humans were aware of alien life but had yet to communicate directly.

The idea of “first contact” haunted the global consciousness. On social media, speculation ranged from hopes for a golden age of cooperation to fears of conquest. Books and films about alien invasion surged in popularity. The science fiction of the past was no longer fantasy but an unsettling reminder of what lay ahead.

In the shadows, conspiracy theories blossomed. Were the aliens here to harvest resources? To experiment on humans? Did their technology allow mind control, surveillance, or worse? For every advance made by scientists, there was a rumor that painted the extraterrestrials as unknowable threats.

Yet even amid the fear, there were glimmers of hope. Environmentalists argued that extraterrestrial knowledge could help humanity reverse climate change. Space agencies across the globe received unprecedented funding as people’s dreams of interstellar travel suddenly seemed closer.

And still, the quiet mystery remained. The world now knew they were not alone—but what did these visitors want? Some believed they would come bearing knowledge. Others feared they would bring destruction. For the time being, all humanity could do was wait.

In a world forever altered, it seemed that everyone—every person, every leader, every institution—was simply waiting for the day when humanity would look into the eyes of the unknown and learn, finally, what it meant to meet the stars.

In the wake of Disclosure Day, sightings of unidentified flying objects didn’t stop—in fact, they seemed to increase. UFOs continued to flit across the skies worldwide, captured on smartphones in cities, on security cameras in remote fields, and through the precision of military sensors. Each new sighting was now public knowledge, and with humanity aware of extraterrestrial presence, every encounter took on a new, almost ritualistic importance. This was no longer the secret domain of shadowy agencies; it was a global phenomenon, experienced and interpreted by all.

# The Everyday Sighting

In the quiet town of Loire-sur-Rhône, France, fifteen-year-old Jules managed to capture something strange on his smartphone—a small, silvery orb hovering over the vineyards before darting away at impossible speed. He posted the video online, and within hours it had gone viral. As the clip circulated, experts around the world dissected it, examining the craft’s movements, its shape, and speed. Mainstream news channels picked it up, while academic groups attempted to analyze the footage, calling it “anomalous” and “consistent with other sightings.”

And Jules wasn’t alone. Almost every week, new footage emerged from ordinary people—a mechanic in Mexico, a farmer in South Korea, a group of hikers in the Rocky Mountains—capturing strange craft performing aerial maneuvers that defied physics. The sightings often prompted immediate government and scientific responses, with agencies stepping in to analyze the data and release preliminary findings to the public.

The world began to see UFOs not as mysterious invaders, but as visitors who regularly “checked in.” It was an unsettling adjustment; people in urban centers around the world now scanned the skies with a new mixture of wonder and fear. UFO sightings became part of daily life, and with each new incident, the public was invited to watch, analyze, and share their thoughts.

# The Pentagon's Open Approach

The U.S. Department of Defense, once the gatekeeper of extraterrestrial secrets, took a radically open stance. They established an interactive online database accessible to the public, logging each new UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena) sighting along with technical data. The platform displayed heat maps showing hotspots of activity, released periodic reports, and published detailed analyses of attempted intercepts by military aircraft.

In one incident over the Pacific Ocean, an F-18 fighter jet detected and attempted to approach a spherical UAP at 70,000 feet. The military released the cockpit footage publicly, with the pilot's tense voice narrating the event. “It’s… right there, zipping along,” the pilot said, in awe and frustration, as the craft darted beyond reach.

The Pentagon’s openness sparked global debate. People argued over every intercepted video, every report, and every piece of data that streamed from the Defense Department. *Should they really be trying to shoot down or intercept these craft?* citizens asked. *Could such actions provoke an alien response?*

Across the Atlantic, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defence and Canada’s Department of National Defence launched similar public disclosure programs. When they couldn’t confirm the origin of a sighting, they simply released it for the world to analyze together. In this new era of transparency, the truth about extraterrestrial encounters was shared openly, as was the uncertainty about what these visitors truly wanted.

# Global Ethical and Diplomatic Discussions

As the sightings continued, and military forces around the world encountered UAPs on a regular basis, ethical and diplomatic questions intensified. The United Nations assembled the *Committee on Extraterrestrial Relations and Ethics* (CERE), bringing together scientists, ethicists, diplomats, and former military officials to tackle the moral issues raised by extraterrestrial encounters.

In one high-profile session, delegates debated the ethics of military engagement with UAPs. Would attempting to shoot down or capture an alien craft constitute an act of hostility? Could it invite retaliation? Some argued that nations should develop strategies for peaceful contact and impose strict no-fire policies on UAP encounters. “We are infants in the cosmic community,” said the Brazilian ambassador to the UN. “Should we not act with caution, rather than aggression?”

Others took a firmer stance, emphasizing the need for self-defense. “If they violate our airspace,” the Russian delegate argued, “we must respond. These are unknown entities, potentially with unknown intentions.” The issue divided the assembly, and although a non-binding resolution discouraging hostile action was passed, each nation retained the right to defend its airspace as it saw fit.

# Scientific Institutes and Communication Experiments

With more nations cooperating, the newly established Global Institute for Extraterrestrial Studies (GIES) took on a bold project: establishing a way to communicate with the unknown. GIES researchers from countries worldwide worked around the clock, devising experiments to try and make contact.

One ambitious project involved sending electromagnetic signals from satellites positioned over areas with frequent sightings. These signals included mathematical patterns, universal constants, and tones based on the Fibonacci sequence, meant to communicate in a language that scientists hoped could be recognized as intelligent. Observatories around the world watched the skies carefully for any kind of response, but so far, there had been only silence.

Meanwhile, in Geneva, physicists, linguists, and cognitive scientists gathered to develop a system they called *Contact Protocol Alpha*—a set of principles and procedures for the day that first real, confirmed communication might occur. Protocol Alpha outlined guidelines on what messages to send, how to respond, and which authorities would have jurisdiction over interspecies diplomacy. Even now, the UN debated whether these protocols should be binding or if each nation would retain autonomy in alien relations.

# Impact on Civilian Life and Culture

In homes around the world, the constant stream of alien-related news shaped people’s lives in unexpected ways. For some, sightings became casual. Tourists gathered at hotspots in Nevada, Patagonia, and the Australian Outback, snapping photos and hoping to catch a glimpse of a UFO. Entire towns began hosting “UAP festivals” with vendors selling everything from alien-themed t-shirts to “extraterrestrial protection devices.”

Yet, fear lingered beneath the surface. Abduction claims grew, with many who’d been previously silent now coming forward with stories of “visits” that were both mysterious and unsettling. Governments began investigating abduction reports more seriously, setting up national registries to track them and study commonalities. In many countries, a new mental health disorder called “Contact Anxiety” was recognized, describing the psychological distress from fear of abduction or alien interference.

Religious communities continued to struggle with the implications of alien life. New spiritual movements emerged that blended belief in the divine with reverence for extraterrestrial intelligence. Some saw the aliens as advanced beings who could guide humanity, while others saw them as dark entities to be feared. Places of worship were filled with prayers for protection, while televangelists preached about the “End Times” and the role aliens might play.

# Ethical Considerations: Should Humanity Make Contact?

As sightings persisted and diplomatic talks continued, a single, looming question emerged: *Should humanity actively try to make contact?*

While many scientists pushed for active attempts to reach out, the ethics community urged caution. A coalition of researchers from the GIES published an open letter warning about the risks of first contact. “We do not understand these beings’ motives, their biology, or their technology,” the letter read. “We must avoid assuming that they would view us as equals. Their intentions may be as incomprehensible to us as ours would be to them.”

Public opinion was deeply divided. In polls conducted globally, the majority of citizens expressed a desire to reach out, though not all wanted the communication to be on Earth’s terms. “Why should we be the ones to extend the hand first?” a Parisian street artist told a reporter, echoing a common sentiment. “What if they’re already watching, waiting to see what we do?”

As weeks passed, it became clear that humanity was living in a strange limbo. UFOs continued to be seen, observed, and analyzed, yet the alien visitors made no attempt to communicate directly. Some began to theorize that the craft were nothing more than probes, studying human reactions and behavior. Others argued they were sentries, waiting for some signal or condition before making themselves known.

And so, the world watched the skies, as aware of the unknown above as they were of each other below. Governments met, scientists experimented, and people waited, collectively holding their breath, wondering what lay beyond—and when, or if, the visitors would finally speak.

**""The Vigil of Earth""**

Two years passed, and the presence of extraterrestrial visitors had become a strange new constant in human life. People had grown used to seeing reports of UAPs—unidentified anomalous phenomena—on the evening news, as casually as they might see updates on weather patterns or international politics. Yet, despite countless sightings, recordings, and studies, the visitors had not made direct contact. They lingered, just out of reach, observing.

# Year One: The Height of the Vigil

The first year saw rapid shifts in culture, science, and geopolitics. The world had braced for immediate, dramatic changes, but as the months passed without direct contact, a new reality emerged—one marked by tense anticipation and a strange sense of unity.

# Global Surveillance and the New Space Race

In a surprising display of cooperation, the UN’s Committee on Extraterrestrial Relations and Ethics (CERE) organized a coalition of global observatories and military radar installations, setting up an unprecedented system of constant, shared surveillance. Known as *VigilNet*, this network offered real-time data on UAP sightings and encouraged the public to report their own. VigilNet’s reports became a fixture in everyday life, with websites and apps allowing people to track sightings in their area.

VigilNet sparked an international race for new detection technology. Countries vied to improve satellite imaging, build faster data-processing systems, and develop sensors that could detect UAPs not just visually, but through energy fields, gravity waves, and other means that would have seemed like science fiction just years before. Companies raced to patent everything from personal UAP detection apps to “personal anti-abduction” devices, though these were largely dismissed as gimmicks.

But it was in space where the most significant developments occurred. The world’s leading space agencies, bolstered by unprecedented funding, launched rapid initiatives to explore nearby regions of space, both to look for signs of alien technology and to find resources that could support human expansion beyond Earth. Mars, the Moon, and even deep-space missions to Jupiter’s moons took on new urgency as humanity sought a foothold in a universe that now felt crowded.

# Public Reactions: Fear, Worship, and Skepticism

Around the world, civilian attitudes ranged from awe to apathy, fear to obsession. Some took the presence of these beings as a symbol of cosmic unity. A spiritual movement called *The Constellant* gained popularity, promoting the idea that aliens were a benevolent force that would guide humanity into a “greater consciousness.” Constellant gatherings were held at well-known UAP hotspots, with hundreds or thousands coming to meditate and “welcome” their distant observers.

Yet there were darker fears as well. In rural regions across the Americas and Europe, reports of alleged alien abductions surged. People claimed to have experienced “missing time” after seeing strange lights, and others found themselves waking up with odd markings or experiencing vivid, inexplicable dreams. The UN took the claims seriously, establishing the *Human Safety in Contact* commission, which offered support for those who believed they’d experienced encounters. A growing field of “contact psychology” also emerged, as experts sought to help people cope with the psychological strain of living in a pre-contact world.

Skepticism also remained strong, with groups claiming that the alien “threat” was exaggerated or even fabricated. Some argued the sightings were part of a disinformation campaign, aimed at uniting the world under a single political agenda or justifying the militarization of space. But most people, skeptical or not, felt a constant sense of uncertainty about what might happen next.

# Year Two: A World on the Brink of Contact

By the second year, VigilNet had documented tens of thousands of UAP sightings, patterns had been observed, and humanity had grown increasingly comfortable with the presence of UAPs. But the tension hadn’t disappeared—it had only deepened. With each sighting, humanity felt it was on the edge of something vast and life-altering.

# The Solar Probes and the First Message

In mid-year, space agencies from around the world collectively launched the *Solar Sentries*—a series of probes designed to observe solar phenomena and any potential alien technology that might be operating within the Sun’s gravitational field. The probes transmitted images, energy readings, and other data back to Earth, all of which was made available to the public.

The world was electrified when, six months later, one of the probes recorded what appeared to be a faint, structured signal originating near the orbit of Mercury. The signal consisted of repeating patterns of pulses, interrupted periodically by pauses that scientists interpreted as some form of encoded message.

Decoding efforts began immediately, with teams from every major nation working around the clock. For weeks, speculation ran wild, but the first breakthrough came when it was determined that the signal wasn’t directed at Earth at all. Instead, it seemed to be a general transmission, perhaps a beacon of some kind, originating from a distant, automated probe.

While the discovery fell short of true communication, the message was proof of alien intelligence—a message in the vastness of space, intentionally structured, waiting to be understood.

# The Ethics of Contact

The detection of this first message ignited an ethical debate that swept the globe. Many argued that humanity should respond, even if just to acknowledge our awareness. A faction within the scientific community, called the *Active SETI Initiative*, pressed for immediate response, fearing that silence might be perceived as indifference or weakness.

Others, particularly in the UN’s CERE, pushed back, urging caution. The chair of CERE, Dr. Marta Ibanez, made an impassioned speech, reminding the world that responding too hastily could invite risks we did not understand. “We are standing on the shore of an unknown ocean,” she said, “and we cannot be certain what lies beneath the waves. We should not call out without understanding what might answer back.”

The debate became a defining issue of the year, dominating public forums, news media, and international policy discussions. Despite widespread public support for sending a response, the UN passed a temporary moratorium on direct communication, urging continued observation and analysis instead.

# A Mysterious Incident Over the Atlantic

Months after the moratorium was enacted, an incident over the Atlantic Ocean shook the world. An international airliner reported being followed by a luminous, egg-shaped object, hovering alongside it for nearly fifteen minutes before vanishing in a burst of blue light. The crew reported no hostility, but the encounter was unnerving, especially as it was witnessed by dozens of passengers and recorded on multiple devices.

The VigilNet sensors had picked up the object as well, and their analysis confirmed the craft’s speed and altitude were unlike anything terrestrial technology could achieve. This wasn’t the first close encounter, but it was one of the most public—and as the news spread, so did the sense that humanity’s watchers were beginning to make their presence known more overtly.

The incident intensified calls for contact from the public. Cities around the world saw mass rallies, with people holding signs saying, “We are ready” and “Let’s make contact.” Many called for world leaders to reconsider the moratorium and establish a global contact protocol.

# The United Earth Council

In response to public pressure and the need for coordinated action, the United Nations took a monumental step, establishing the *United Earth Council on Extraterrestrial Relations* (UEC). This body would be responsible for making final decisions on behalf of humanity regarding alien contact and managing humanity’s response to extraterrestrial activity.

Representatives from every UN member state joined the council, which would handle global policy on issues ranging from direct communication to defense protocols and scientific research. The UEC launched a comprehensive protocol, stipulating the conditions under which humanity would engage with extraterrestrial life. The council also invested in research to develop a universal, non-verbal language of patterns, mathematical symbols, and sounds—a language they hoped could serve as the first line of communication if humanity ever made direct contact.

# The Second Signal and Humanity’s Response

Just weeks after the UEC’s establishment, VigilNet detected a second structured signal—this time directed unmistakably at Earth.

The signal was complex and undeciphered, but it repeated every three hours, as if waiting for a reply. Unlike the first message, this one appeared to be actively searching for a response, its patterns varying slightly with each repetition, almost as if it were testing different languages or frequencies.

After a tense week of debate, the UEC authorized a response. In a solemn ceremony broadcast worldwide, the UEC sent humanity’s first official message into space: a series of mathematical constants, representations of Earth’s location, and simple greetings in several human languages.

For the first time in history, humanity had spoken to the unknown.

# The Vigil Continues

As the second year drew to a close, the world held its breath. Days passed without a reply, and humanity’s message seemed to vanish into the endless dark.

But VigilNet continued its watch, and scientists held to hope. Schools held vigils, broadcasting their hopes for peaceful contact. People gathered in parks and on rooftops, staring at the sky, wondering if their message had been received.

Humanity had crossed a threshold, stepping from passive observation into the unknown realm of cosmic dialogue. And as the Vigil of Earth continued, people knew their watchers were out there, observing and waiting.",1,1731440537.0,UFOs_Archives,1,1.0,False
1gptfx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Latuda/comments/1gptfx2/sleeping_too_much_and_would_like_some_advice_from/,Sleeping too much and would like some advice from the community ,"I was on Latuda 2012-2016 then 2020-currently. Both times I’ve had this issue. I sleep a lot. It is near impossible to wake up. I’ve had two different doctors in these time periods and they both don’t really give me opinions on what else to do. They always ask me if I’m sleeping well and I tell them I’m sleeping 12-16 hours a day and they’re just like “as long as you’re sleeping”. 


I told them this is a struggle with work. I was working remotely before so I would kinda get by logging in until I was fully awake by noon then catching up on my work. Now I’m laid off and searching for a job so I don’t need to wake up early. 

My issue is that I might have to settle for a hybrid/on site job soon and idk how I’m going to do it if I feel so sleepy in the morning. 

Yes I could sleep at 7pm so I can somewhat wake up at 8am, but sleeping takes up so much of my day I can’t keep living life like this. 

The Latuda itself works great. My Bipolar symptoms are regulated and living life happy otherwise it’s just it is very difficult waking up. 

To clarify, I can leave several alarms and sleep through then all or I wake up but feeling super anxious and agitated if I try to keep my eyes open. Sometimes I wake up and take an energy drink or coffee but still sleep for another 4 hours or so. 

Occasionally I skip my pill and that helps me have a normal 8 hours of sleep but I usually don’t do this unless it’s urgent(early morning meeting or flight to catch). I don’t like doing this because I don’t want to make it a habit and have my symptoms back. Before the pill I was sleeping 3-5 hours a night plus the mood swings. 

Has anybody else had this issue? Considering another doctor but what would I tell them? Any recommendations? 

I appreciate it. ",1,1731440489.0,Latuda,0,1.0,False

It was a quiet day in the Club Penguin Town Center, until DJ Cadence, full of her usual spunk, showed up to blast her latest beats in the Dance Club. The penguins flocked, their flippers waving, their bodies bouncing to the rhythm, each stomp on the floor vibrating through the ice.

But one penguin stayed behind, watching from the sidelines: Aunt Arctic, notebook in flipper, glasses fogged from the heat of the crowd. She'd been assigned to cover the event for this week’s Penguin Times, and, as she peered over the top of her spectacles, she couldn’t help but notice how vibrant DJ Cadence looked beneath the flashing lights.

""Ugh, all work and no play,"" muttered Cadence, catching Arctic's gaze from the DJ booth. ""Maybe a dance break's just what *you* need!""

Aunt Arctic laughed, and for once, she let herself be dragged to the dance floor. DJ Cadence cranked up the volume, the beat pumping faster, until Aunt Arctic was laughing like she hadn’t since she was a chick.

After the dance, DJ Cadence handed her a cup of hot chocolate from the Coffee Shop next door, “So, any plans for tomorrow?”

Aunt Arctic blushed beneath her glasses. “I have… an editorial deadline,” she murmured, almost sheepishly.

“Right, right, but, you know, deadlines can wait. I’ve got a new beat I want you to hear—it’s exclusive!” Cadence winked.

They met the next day, and the next, Cadence showing her the latest music, Arctic sharing tales of her newsroom adventures. They laughed, their flippers brushed against each other’s as they both reached for a chocolate fish biscuit, and slowly, something more than friendship began to form.

And then, one fateful Thursday, the *Penguin Times* featured a surprise headline, penned by Aunt Arctic herself:

**BREAKING NEWS: CLUB PENGUIN’S FAVORITE DJ AND MOST RESPECTED JOURNALIST MAKE WAVES ON AND OFF THE DANCE FLOOR!**

The paper was filled with a full-page spread of DJ Cadence and Aunt Arctic sharing a quick, tender kiss beneath the snowflake lights of the Dance Club, and right then, the whole island knew that this unlikely pair had truly broken the ice.

They kept dancing together, DJ Cadence spinning tracks while Aunt Arctic scribbled notes, both knowing that their beats and words were all they needed to keep each other warm through any snowstorm.",1,1731440372.0,ClubPenguin,0,1.0,False

Long story short, after meeting another new derm today, I am just wondering if applying steroid cream would be probably the only way to solve this problem. I am quite new here with eczema, I have tried earlier to also „clean“ myself naturally by doing elim diet. Ended up not so bad actually for my skin. It could manage to control it till 80%. But I lost 10 kgs within a month. 

Well then I thought I won. But after 2 mo it flared up again, almost on the same spots, with diffrent look. Earlier was mostly round patches,some even filled up with liquid, and the second wave, was more like rashes. Like aloooot of rashes. 

I am now thinking maybe one month elim diet was not enough or maybe I should just live with no breakfast (intermittent fasting), no sugar, no dairy (inkl the alternatives), no coffee, and no gluten till the rest of my life. But in practical, it is very difficult. I feel like I am starving. I dont always have time to prepare foods and bring it to work🥲. Then I ended up only drinking water awhole day and eat green salad only. I am an asian, living in Germany, bread(gluten) is available at every corner. I always feel sad, when I cant just grab some bread filled up with things and go anymore. 

Or… maybe I should just give a try this steroid cream again. 

This sounds probably too much drama for some people. But it is really truely how I feel right now🙁

“No mocha!” She immediately raises her voice, now idgaf, my connection scores are through the roof, i can de-escalate a situation and still hold my ground respectfully with any customer. 

I explained to her that rest assured, I will make sure she gets what she ordered. It is just the correct pronunciation of the beverage. (The pos button also says “WHITE CHOCOLATE MOCHA”) 

She is with a friend, her friend ordered a drink perfectly fine (driver) and they pull up to the window. 

I am immediately asked “was that you taking our order?” To which I reply “yes, it was - confirms order again-“ 

This woman starts telling me that in all of her years of going to Starbucks they have never called it that, and I turned the POS over as if she could even read it and I show her that it is called white chocolate mocha. 

I am a coffee master, this has been my only job since 16 years old, i know what I’m doing lady. 

Whatever, just made me annoyed, SM told her off for disrespecting me because my baristas around me know that if i disengage from a customer (which i have only twice now with her,) that i really got ticked off or something was disrespectful because i always go above and beyond.

At 23-24 I had a great (albeit pretty mundane) office job that paid decently, at a company I really liked, with lots of coworkers I got along really really well with. I decided to leave it and go back to study because I felt like I never gave my passions a chance at becoming my career (due to COVID, and also laziness). 

After just 4 months of studying, and a couple months of part-time work in retail, I was absolutely miserable. I lost all interest in the things I thought I was passionate about, was making next to no money, and all my free time was filled with studying and working. I wished I could just undo it all and go back to my office job. I never quite realised how good I had it, and how well that lifestyle suited me until I left it all behind..

I swallowed my pride and reached out to them (my old company) again 2 weeks ago. Come yesterday,  I ended up meeting with 2 of my old bosses for coffee and they offered me a new job they'd created because I reached out. Even better pay than when I left, too. 

Dropped out of my studies immediately, put my notice in to my retail job, and I start again with my old company in a couple weeks, just in time for Christmas.

I learned that my passions/interests and work should be kept far away from eachother. Some people live to work and make a difference in the world with their work, climb ladders, earn big money and just have massive aspirations in general, and that's totally admirable and respectable. The amount of people on social media who love to show off their progress and boast their achievements made me subconsciously feel like I had to do it too. But, it's just not who I am.

I'm trying to eat as much protein as I can and drink milk for calcium. I often have cottage cheese and yogurt during the day. This amount of dairy starting to upset my stomach a little. I'm also eating pineapples for bromelain, oranges for vitamin C, and taking beet capsules for calcium absorption. I have a generic bone health multi and my normal vitamin D prescription since I'm deficient. Anyone have any tips on what else I can do to heal as best as possible? I was thinking about a good protein powder for coffee or some sort of collegen creamer. I still drink a cup of coffee a day, but I limit it to one now as well as avoiding alcohol completely. Also trying to drink a lot of water, which was real hard the first week as I was afraid to move at all and was terrified of trying to get to the bathroom.

I'm also in adult braces and can't chew anything but soft food, my teeth are kind of shot too.

1gpt4iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1gpt4iv/please_try_these_things_if_you_havent_already/,PLEASE try these things if you haven’t already!,"I’ve suffered from chronic constipation for an entire year partly due to eating food intolerances and not drinking enough water. But for the past few months despite vastly improving my diet, it’s stuck with me. Until I tried these things.


• Magnesium Citrate

 (if you’ve tried this and it didn’t work for you, try the BlueBonnet tablets. I take 400-600mg a night)

• Tea

(Tea is super helpful for your body because it has antibacterial properties and helps soothe your digestive system. I take ginger tea, digestive tea blends, vitamin C tea, and roasted dandelion root. I take these steeped in warm water after I take my magnesium at night)

• Electrolytes 

(These have been incredible because if you exercise and lose water, or if you’re constipated and it just won’t budge no matter what, electrolytes can stimulate your bowels)

NOW HERE ARE THE ABSOLUTE GAME CHANGERS

• Artichoke and ginger extracts

(I just recently got these a couple days ago, they’re incredible. For someone who most likely has slow motility constipation, this is amazing. It also helps so much with digestion. If you’re feeling heavy after a meal, just take these and they work so well. You’ll be feeling much better in like 30 minutes.)

• Stop eating rice

(No seriously stop eating rice. I was eating multiple rice cakes a day, probably the equivalent to a cup or cup and a half of rice. Even that stopped me up. I had no idea until I recently quit eating them and replaced them with corn cakes. It has made an astronomical difference.)


_____________________________________

Now I don’t know if all of these things together are working, or if one of them is single handedly keeping my bowels in check, but I feel like the old me again. It’s crazy. My mental health has been suffering so bad from the stress of being constipated all the time, because I know the more constipated I am, the more the stool just sits there and creates bacteria in my gut, causing even more havoc on my body.

After taking these things (especially the ginger and artichoke extracts, fucking insane) I am completely emptying my bowels every single day. I haven’t been constipated at all since doing these things all together.

I’d also add that in the mornings I drink electrolytes then I eat a tablespoon of flaxseed and drink black coffee to stimulate a bowel movement. I could probably go without this but it helps me go immediately. I’ve done it for months but now it’s actually helping.

It’s crazy what some of us have to do to just empty our bowels, but if it works, it’s worth it. The idea of being constipated stresses me out more than having to do a little routine.",4,1731439729.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

Kamusta? I’m sure you are doing well. 7 weeks na pala simula nung nag send ako ng mahabang message tapos ang reply mo lang ay heart react 👻 hanggang dulo talaga nilito parin ako hehe joke!!

How’s life treating you?

Mine has been pretty chill and fun.
I went back to running and started to have genuine interest in fitness. Nag s-start na ko mag prepare para sa trip ko soon. Sobrang excited ako. Naalala ko pa na kinwento ko sayo yun kasi nga excited ako sa sunset na makikita ko doon.

Recently, Na-commend ako about something na ginawa ko dahil don sa isa ko pang passion. I thanked you personally nung interview. For sure di mo yun makakikita, isang beses lang kasi pinakita yong coverage non haha pero I posted about it, nakita mo naman. I hope you know it is for you. I used to hate this and blame you for putting me in this situation pero ngayon I just smile kasi I recently realized that what I don’t is a part of me and this is a privilege na hindi lahat nae-experience.

Work has been toxic. Pero lagi naman, I hope your work is treating you well. Ang hirap ng work mo and I find it so noble kasi working in the food industry is such an exhausting work. I hope you find it rewarding when customers are nice to you.

Alam mo ba recently, noong sobrang naalala kita at kailangan ko lang ilabas yon through pag kwento sa isang memory na meron ako of you, my friend told me na maybe the reason why it didn’t work out kasi you might feel pressured of who I am and what I do. Na baka kaya ka nag hesitate ay dahil sa views ko sa buhay at you feel na what you’re doing is not good enough compared sa mga ginagawa ko sa buhay.

if totoo yon, I hope you know that it didn’t matter to me. it will never matter, kasi regardless kung sino mas malaki yung kita satin, you are the most chill and positive person I know. that’s more than enough. masipag ka e. mareklamo nga lang HAHAHAHA pero masipag, that’s what matters to me. kasi kung ganon ka, we’ll always find a way to compromise. kaso baka it’s more than that. so ayoko na rin isipin pa.

I clung to our conversations kasi I have liked you for so long, sinabi ko naman yon sayo sa mahabang kung anong mang sinend ko HAHAHA 

Talking to you ang pahinga ko. Kaya nung tumigil ako, for the first week, I was so restless. Di ako makatulog ng maayos. I was out of focus. After 2 weeks, di ko na kinaya. Kinwento ko na sa iba at gumaan lang pakiramdam ko nung sinabi nila sakin na cutting our ties kept you safe from the chaos of my life.

Your safety is a priority. Keeping you by my side will only hurt you dahil sa magulong mundo ko.

 I fear that I will never feel this way for anyone (thank fuck kasi this hurts) but like what I said, no blocking and talking shit. How could I when your presence was the one that kept me sane for this year? You were a sanctuary for me.

ayan ang haba nanaman. pero I wish you the best. sa totoo lang, if you send me a message and tell me that you miss me and you want to meet for coffee, I’ll drop anything just to meet you.

whether it’s to start over or just to see you for one last time. I’ll do it.

pero feeling ko hindi naman na yon mangyayari.

So I’ll just live this life and try to make the most of it.

and you.

You take care.

I’ve tried changing grind, dose, pre infusion, etc. I always get slow/choked pulls that are still sour. I think it’s channeling…especially since it always flows exclusively from one side. On the bottomless it flows closest to the handle, if I use the stock spouted pf, it flows only out of the right side.

I grind into a dosing cup df64 gen 2, put in big bang basket (I have a stainless funnel thing), WDT, a good thump on the table to settle the grinds, and then I tamp with the breville stock tamper. Bambino plus, and I always preheat the pf and machine 2x before pulling the first shot. 

I’m frustrated because I keep using up my good beans on sour shots, and I don’t always want milk in my coffee to save it.

1gpt12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1gpt12m/i_want_to_fix_my_sleep_schedule/,I want to fix my sleep schedule,"I find it incredibly hard to get out of bed in the morning, and it's the only way that I can regulate my sleep schedule. I know I'm not going to be magically sleepy when I go to bed, I have to actually get up at a regular time in order to keep it even a little bit consistent. especially in the winter here, if I sleep in I barely get any sunlight time.  
My problem is that I just don't have the mental fortitude to actually get up and not turn my alarm off, or set a way later one. My work is very flexible, but sometimes I do have to get up early for it, so I'd prefer not to make a huge deal of it and end up losing sleep because I'm anxious about having to work early that day. (its not even early its like 10am)

The only solution I can think of is bribing myself somehow so that getting out of bed is more enticing than staying in bed with my comfy kitties.  
perhaps by setting the coffee maker to go off in the morning, or having a pre-made breakfast or snack, or maybe even setting the cats feeder to go off so they get out of bed too, instead of enticing me to stay in.

any other suggestions on how to fix my sleep schedule and KEEP it fixed would be great! I can usually fix it somehow but it just ends up messed up again as soon as I have one good week of being able to sleep in.",2,1731439495.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

1gpstvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/buoyhydration/comments/1gpstvp/buoy_hydration_drops_faq/,Buoy Hydration Drops FAQ,"**Buoy Hydration Drops FAQ** \- add your question in the comments!

**Do I need to have a subscription?**  
Nope, but that is the best way to save! On our website you have a choice between a one-time order or signing up for a monthly subscription, which can be paused or canceled at any time. You can even swap out what comes in your monthly subscription or reduce the frequency of deliveries. 

**Are Buoy Hydration Drops really flavorless?**  
We don’t add flavoring to our drops so that you can add them into anything you want, but some people may notice a subtle mineral taste. 

**When should I notice a difference using these?**  
While a lot of people notice results after about a week of consistent use, for others it can take up to a month or two for your body to reach its new normal.

**Why can’t I buy just 1 at a time?**  
3 bottles is about a one month supply - but we offer a money back guarantee on every order through our website so that if you don't like it, you're not out on anything! Sending 3 at a time also helps us cut down on packaging and shipping so we can remain carbon neutral. 

**Do I need to provide documentation of my illness to get the chronic illness support discount?**  
No, we rely on the honor system. Fill out our quick form and you’ll see your discount automatically applied in our web store immediately. 

**Is your website the only place to buy?**  
We do sell on Amazon, but our site is the best way to support us! We offer a money back guarantee and cheapest prices plus carbon neutral shipping!

**Will the drops break my fast?**  
Our drops won't break your fast!  We're as clean as you can get and help you power past the ""keto flu"" and hydrate without changing your metabolic state! Great question!

**Are your products HSA/FSA eligible?**    
Currently the drops are only available for purchase through our site - we are working on HSA/FSA eligibility and will definitely post about it once this becomes available! In the meantime - our chronic illness discount will get you 35% off for life if you are using Buoy to manage symptoms.

**Are your B vitamins methylated?**  
Nope! Methylation is typically only in reference to B9 and B12, which we don't use. The others, which we use, don't typically come in a methylated form (there is a rare B6 form floating around but is not standard or widely used). We use the cleanest, most absorbable forms of B1, B5, and B6 (not methylated).

**Why do your drops expire?**  
The drops have an expiration date because they are made with herbs and supplements - they have an incredibly long shelf life but we are still required to include an expiration date. Although we can’t advise using them after the exp date on the bottle, if you're in a pinch nothing in there really goes ""bad"".

**How much caffeine is in your energy drops?**  
There is 30 mg of caffeine from green tea in our energy drops (which are the only ones with caffeine). This is about a 1/3 a cup of coffee - or what we like to call, the perfect pick me up.

**Is there citric acid in the drops?**  
All of our drops contain citric acid, but we use the smallest amount possible to stay shelf stable! Our citric acid isn’t made from corn OR mold! It’s derived from 100% pure anhydrous citric acid from cassava. It's such a miniscule amount (just for shelf stability) that it's not usually an issue for anyone with lime/citrus allergies! We were especially sensitive to that in our formulations. The particular variety of citric acid used in Buoy is Non-GMO Project verified and USP grade. USP grade signifies that it has been certified by the United States Pharmacopeia, which ensures that products are the appropriate identity as well as strength, quality, purity and consistency.  

**Why is the packaging different on my second order?**  
On your first order, we send a welcome box, but after that your packages will arrive in brown envelopes to reduce waste as part of our sustainability initiatives.

**Why is there such a small amount of magnesium?**  
We harvest our electrolytes directly from the ocean and we don’t change or mess with the natural occurring ratios of the electrolytes and minerals!

1gpstsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/intelnuc/comments/1gpstsk/problems_with_nuc8i5beh_on_ubuntu_server_desktop/,Problems with NUC8i5BEH on Ubuntu Server & Desktop,"I recently bought my NUC8i5BEH from a electronics recycling place.

Originally, I loaded Ubuntu server 24.04.1 onto it as I wanted to use it for a docker container powerhouse (I have been using a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB for awhile).

I noticed a few problems though... originally, the place gave me a 45W power supply. I immediately thought that it was the cause of the crashes. I went back to the place and got a 65W power supply. Came home, loaded Ubuntu Server back on it, started my containers (4 at the time) and immediately started seeing the same issue. What even stood out is I wasn't running the containers at all at one point and it still crashed. This started annoying me horribly.

I ran memtest all night 3 passes, all tests (except for the experimental one), and passed flawlessly.

I am not sure what the disk drive's health is like, but it reported back on Ubuntu Desktop (booted via USB to check disk drive health) ~~and didn't throw any errors when it came to health~~.

After that, I researched the issues I was having and came up with the idea of, ""must be an Ubuntu issue... let's try desktop really quick to see if it is the same result"". *Just* finished with Ubuntu desktop 24.04.1 and still having the same issue.

I did made it freeze again (on purpose this time) just so I can grab the output when it started back up again. I used `journalctl -b -1 -e` to try and get the logs right on startup, this is the output below. How would I go about solving this issue?

Hardware Specs:

* Intel i5-8259U (8) @ 3.800GHz
* Intel CoffeeLake-U GT3e \[Iris Plus Graphics 655\]
* 16GB of DDR4 memory
* SSD: Model Number: Patriot P210 256GB, Serial Number: P210JCBB24022102874

Edit: Correction on the drive health, it reported back that everything was 'OK', not sure entirely still on SSD health

I just got this new rug which I love, but I feel like the space still doesn’t look too refined. I want it to feel kind of richer, a bit more mature. I’ve been thinking about changing the coffee table to a wooden one, but our dining room table (not pictured but horizontal from the couch) is also the same white ikea material, so I don’t know if swapping out the coffee table will make the dining room part look (attaching images)

1gpsqx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gpsqx5/right_travel_grinder_for_picopresso_and_aeropress/,Right Travel Grinder for Picopresso and Aeropress with Flow Control [India],"Hello Brewers,
I travel a lot with my coffee kit which has a Picopresso with IMS precision basket, Aeropress with able fine disk & flow control cap. I currently use a Timemore C3 Grinder and my roast preference is usually medium and medium to dark. Sometimes light but never dark roast.

I am thinking to upgrade my grinder. Initially I was thinking to get a 'staresso discovery ii' to skip the manual effort but then realised that its no good that's why its cheap. Then I heard about premium electric grinder 'millab e01' but it has mixed reviews and I don't want to spend so much money on a sceptical product.

Should I simply upgrade to the iconic 1zpresso or continue with the Timemore C3? If yes, then which model of 1z should I go for?

Here's how I can classify my brew ratio and preference:

Equipment: 
40% picopresso 
30% aeropress 
20% hario switch 
10% delonghi dedica 

Roast Level:
50% medium 
30% medium - dark

1gpsqqp,https://i.redd.it/m06tc0shsi0e1.jpeg,My boss is talking to us about her financial debt. ,"Hey guys I am a hairstylist at a commission salon and our boss sent out an email and I don’t know how to feel about it. 

She has 2 commission salons and to summarize the long email she sent one salon she is saying she is really in debt for and she is thinking of making that salon booth rental. Which to me doesn’t make sense to have one commission salon and the other booth rental? 

She is saying she will change the schedules of stylist to make them part time since everyone doesn’t fit in the first salon since there is 6 chairs and 9 stylist. And the first will stay commission. 

She is also complaining about having to buy meals and coffee for us while it’s nice of her to do we are not telling her to buy us anything. She is complaining about buying holiday decorations that she has to buy towels and capes with her own money…. But as a salon owner you would think that’s something you’re supposed to do. 

But then she will buy expensive stuff for the salon that she really doesn’t need and then complain to us that the salon is in debt. She has told us she is trying to pay a 100k loan she just took out lol. I will leave a screenshot of a little snippet of the email. And I just don’t know what to respond or say. What do you guys think of this? Any advice? ",4,1731438798.0,hairstylist,7,1.0,False

1. Lattafa Raghba For Man

Cannot go wrong with this one. Pretty much an exact clone of davidoff cool water or creed green irish tweed. This remains one of my favourite ever scents. I am only 23 years old but this scent is timeless and I will always love it.

Total score: 8.8/10


2. Khamrah Qahwa

I tried the OG version and I found it very sweet for my liking. So I read that this one has a coffee note that makes it much better.  I definitely smell it, I smell it a bit way too much. I don’t know but for me, coffee is not a note that should be on a fragrance.

This one is definitely not for me.

Total score: 5/10


3. Al Nashama Caprice

I never smelled La Nuit Blue Electrique so I can’t compare it to that one. I will only review this fragrance as its own thing.

Not a fan of the opening, for some reason I can smell a load of cinnamon. But after it dries down…boy does change drastically!

First off, I love the lavender in this one. If you don’t like Lavender steer away from this one. If you do like lavender, this one is a no brainer.

It’s a perfect mix of lavender, woody and warm spicy. Would easily wear this and pull this off, but not something I will get for my collection as I am extremely picky on what scents I buy. I only like to have fragrances which I absolutely love.

Final score: 7.8


4. Jean Lowe Immortal/Immortel

Never smelled LV L’Immensite so I can’t compare it to that one.

Very citrusy and amber forward. Super fresh and versatile fragrance that can be worn in Summer and Winter. Also very mass appealing. I compare to a clean wet wipe smell.

Out of all these samples, I can confidently say this is the safest blind buy one can make. 

Once again, this will not be added to my fragrance collection as I do not LOVE it.

Final score: 7.2/10


5. Lattafa Wajood

Had a lot of hype for this one. It is described as an aquatic and marine type fragrance. However it is not your classic aquatic fragrance. I would not even classify it as so.

It’s a very bitter, inky, dark ocean scent. It’s somewhat boozey as well. One of the weirdest fragrances I’ve ever experienced for sure.

Do not listen to people comparing it to Kenzo Homme, it is very different. Not a safe blind buy as it’s very unique.

Again, not for me unfortunately.

Final score: 6.2/10


6. Lattafa Safeer

Nope. Literally smells like lemon. Thats it. Thats all I can smell. The worst one of all the samples.

Total score: 4.3/10


7. Vintage Radio

Waaaaaayyyyy to sweet for my liking. I would consider this a feminine scent. 

My girlfriend loved it and told this is the one she likes best from all the samples. She kept on telling me I should get this. Even my brother told me this is the best one. Also my dad loved it. Which makes me wonder how the hell I did not find this fragrance nice at all. I don’t know I just would not like to go walking around smelling like a plum.

Also shows how subjective fragrances are. Each nose is different.

One day an older guy sat down on one of the tables i needed to care about. I took his order and noticed that he was looking at my tits the whole time.

After like 3 Minuets his order was done and I brought it to his table. It was quite empty at this time. He started a little conversation with me and asked a lot of things like if I like the job or if I am Single. A little bit weird but I answered these questions. I thought he needed to talk to someone.

After a little bit of smalltalk he asked if I am interested in older guys or more into guys my age. I answered that I had a lot of experience and that I also like older guys. Then the question came if I would like to satisfy him for some money. I didn’t knew how to react. He pulled out his wallet and took out 1000 euros. I asked him what kind of satisfaction he answered a blowjob. I got blushed and said sure.

He said I should go to the bathroom and he would go a minute later. We both sneaked into the bathroom I got on my knees. He pulled down his pants I opened my mouth and he started to fuck my face. He grabbed my head and pushed his dick completely in my mouth. He said I would get the First 1000 euros if I let him use me as a fuck doll. He slapped me and pounded his dick again in my mouth. It felt amazing. I started to touch my Self and became wet.

After sometime he said that here would be my second payment and he shot his load down my throat. I swallowed everything. He pulled up his pants grabbed 2000 euros and put the money in my back pocket. 1000 for blowjob and 1000 for letting him finish in my mouth. He went out of the bathroom and left the store.

She took our drink order and after another 10 minutes returned with one beverage and said coffee would be several minutes as it was brewing.  She then took our order.  It was another 30 minutes before she began to bring  order to our table and then the main items came separately and several minutes apart after another staff member came around and asked if our order had even been taken.  All in all what should have been 30-45 minutes at most from sitting down, ordering, and receiving our food took an hour and a half!  And then part of the order was incorrect but by that time we were just ready to eat and leave ASAP.  It appeared that many items had been prepared and were waiting to be brought out to tables but the serving staff was more concerned about leaving at the end of their shift then doing their jobs or making sure to hand off our table to another server.

I don't want to directly ask her because I'd love for it to be a surprise, but I know people are very particular about it.

I do not know anything about coffee, so I went to Reddit and did research - it confused me even more to be completely honest. I saw most people suggest Baratza Encore as an entry-level grinder (also the most affordable since I am a student), but when I google it so many come up, that I am unsure which one people are referring to.

For reference, she got a De Longhi Dedica espresso machine, I know that's probably so vague but I only know it was about 200$, and not the exact model... I am sorry I am coming in so uninformed, I tried to get as much info as I could subtly hahaha

1gpsl6c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gpsl6c,"2 adults, 2 days, 4 parks","Trip report from two people, two nights, two weeks ago. Me (42F, first year of AP) and brother (59M, had only been to MK once in the 80s).

TLDR: one AP, one 2 day park hopper ticket, MLL passes for each day and one ILL, staying on property. first night AsS, first day rode FOP, Navi, Everest x2, Kilimanjaro, Lion King show, Kali River Rapids, The Land, Moana walkthrough, Mission Space, Spaceship Earth, Soarin, Frozen, Guardians, Gran Fiesta, Remy's. Second night Dolphin, second day rode ROTR, Smuggler's, ToT x2, RnR coaster, Frozen show, Star Tours, Tron, Space Mountain, Astro Orbitor, Tiana, treehouse walkthrough, 5:15pm uber to airport for 7:45pm flight. Never waited longer than 15 minutes for a ride, ate QS/festival booths in parks.

Sunday- landed at MCO 6:45pm, took 7:05 Lynx bus ($2) to Disney Springs. Had an 8:15pm reservation at Frontera Cocina and were seated outside right away. Food and service was great. Dessert at Salt & Straw. Disney bus to All Star Sports. We could have gone straight to the room but I had questions for the front desk about the bus schedule so checked in in-person. We picked up breakfast at the food court on our way to the room.

Monday's plan: AK morning- rope drop FOP, MLL Bug 8am (throwaway to get Epcot for afternoon), Kilimanjaro 9am, Everest 10:30am. Try for evening Epcot return times so we could have the afternoon free.

We got up at 6, packed our stuff to bring (just backpacks since such a short trip), got the second bus to AK at 6:32. Ate our yogurt parfaits in line at AK. Early hours started at 7:30 and we were pretty close to the front of the line. At 7:17 I took a picture as they let us into Pandora and we basically walked on to FOP. When we exited the wait for Navi River was 10 minutes, so we did that, then walked to Bug to scan in. I started to say something to the CM about changing my mind about Bug but he cut me off basically saying I get it, you're just scanning in so you can get another LL later :-) I got Frozen for 7:25pm. We saw Everest was only a 5 minute wait so we did that twice in a row and I modified that LL to get Soarin at 6pm. Then we did Kilimanjaro, which was the first time the LL was helpful that morning, and I got Mission Space in the evening (Remy never showed as available at any point). After the safari we walked through a bit of the gorilla trail and then went to the 10am Lion King show. After exiting we rode Kali River Rapids and walked the tiger trail. We exited the park around 11:30 and got on a bus to Epcot.

When we got to Epcot we got lunch, went to Club Cool, and failed at getting a VQ spot for Guardians at 1pm. That surprised me- I've gotten it 3/3 times I've tried at 1pm over the past year and didn't think it would be a problem. For an afternoon break (and so I could show my brother my favorite things) we took the skyliner to Riviera to get the Riviera cookie. For fun we took the skyliner from there to HS and then took the boat to Swan/Dolphin to check in. I had gotten the text that the room was ready and we immediately changed and headed to the pool for an hour. We walked to Epcot around 4:30, rode The Land and walked through Moana. Pretty back to back we did Mission Space, Spaceship Earth, and Soarin, and got a 10pm return time for Guardians from the 6pm VQ (I had booked Dolphin for the Monday night for this reason). We got some food on our walk to Frozen and then completed the World Showcase loop when we got out. We took turns holding a fireworks spot and getting more food before the booths closed at 9. After the fireworks our Guardians time was called (early) and we basically walked on. Remy had been showing down around the fireworks time and was still down when we exited Guardians. We rode Gran Fiesta just because it was there and I wanted to give time for Remy's to open, though park closing was about an hour away at that point. I decided to walk over and ask the CMs if they thought Remy might open again, as I didn't want to wait around if they had no intention to. Lo and behold the ride had just reopened and they hadn't updated the app yet, so we walked on and rode it entirely alone. Definitely a pleasant surprise for the evening! We walked back to Dolphin and were in our room by 11 probably. We had gotten upgraded to a park view room and it was so pretty to look out over the illuminated boardwalk area.

Tuesday plan: HS morning- rope drop ROTR, MLL RnR 9:25am, Frozen 10:30am, ToT 10:45am, Oga's 11:40am. Try for MK afternoon times before flight.

We got up at 6:30 and while my brother was getting ready I got coffee and breakfast sandwiches from Fuel. We ate them on the walk to HS just after 7. We were the second people in line at our turnstyle and at 8am were the 3rd and 4th people walking down Hollywood Blvd (early hours started at 8:30). We walked onto ROTR and rode it alone, then walked on to Smuggler's. We saw TOT had a 10 minute wait and headed there, but right as we got there the CMs said early entry was closed and we needed to get in the regular entry line that had formed for that section of the park. I didn't expect that, but even from the back of that line it was only a 15 minute wait for ToT. When we exited we rode the rollercoaster and I got a 3:25 Space Mountain LL time. When I scanned into Frozen I got 4:55 Thunder Mountain. After Frozen we headed back to ToT for our MLL, though there wasn't anything super exciting to pick at MK then (we had to leave for the airport around 5:15ish so anything later wasn't an option). I chose Buzz and figured I'd look at it again later. We had a quick drink at Oga's at 11:45 and did Star Tours on the way out. We were on a bus to MK around 12:30 and I encouraged my brother to mobile order lunch during the commute and he didn't want to, which turned out to be the only thing to bite us the whole trip.
 
When we got to MK we headed straight to Pecos Bill's to grab lunch, and it was mayhem. We stood in an unmoving line for about ten minutes before I just mobile ordered from the line. The food was ready at the mobile order window before I would have even placed it had I continued to wait. We exited during parade setup so it took a little longer than normal to walk, but we headed to our 1:55 ILL for Tron a little after 2pm. In between Tron and Space Mountain we rode Astro Orbitor, and when I pulled up the app to check if there was anything better than Buzz a 3pm Tiana's spot had opened! That was a surprise, it had said VQ only earlier and no other times had popped up when I booked/looked. The people behind us there said they had gotten it as a surprise around the same time. So keep checking your app for Tiana! We decided a 4:55 Thunder Mountain return was pushing it a little close to our airport departure, so we walked through Swiss Family Robinson on the way out for nostalgia and posed for a couple castle pics. It was a good thing we hadn't pushed it because I didn't know the uber pickup for MK is at the TTC. We could have walked to Contemporary or GF I guess, but the monorail was approaching and we got on that easily. It was actually a pretty quick process and we arrived at the airport for a 7:45pm flight with plenty of time to spare (TSA being pretty quiet helped).

This is not the style of trip I normally make- I'm an out of state AP who comes at random times for 1-2 days, works remotely from the parks (mostly Epcot) in the day and occasionally goes on rides when the wait times are low. Mostly I'm there to eat my way around the world and just be in a warm, happy atmosphere while I work. I pitched this trip to my brother with the idea that it was going to be intense on purpose, since he had never been to 3/4 parks (and his kids are all grown so would never have gone again unless one of them randomly turned into a Disney adult in their 40s like me :-) ) I had never properly rope dropped before and was really impressed with how quiet/fun it was, and would totally do it again if I ""needed"" to (ie brought someone else for a trip with big goals). I never get any LLs when I'm alone, as I don't do a lot of rides and don't mind waiting if I decide to. It was crucial to this trip obviously, and so was staying on property (especially a deluxe category hotel on a night with extended park hours). Basically everything worked out perfectly and I'm so glad we did it. When I got the $$$ AP I knew I wanted to do something different with my trips to help rationalize the cost, and so while this trip added more $$ the time and memories with my brother on something we never would have done otherwise was priceless.

Side note: the system did not recognize the split stay for ADRs. I called and made the Oga’s reservation on our second day by phone because they could manually override it (though I know I didn’t need to, there was always a ton of availability). It *did* recognize it automatically for the 7 day out MLL reservations, which was more important for us this trip.",10,1731438424.0,WaltDisneyWorld,0,0.86,False

1gpsj88,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1gpsj88/lost_and_dont_know_how_to_proceed/,Lost and don’t know how to proceed ,"tldr at the top: 39/F, went to urgent care for prolonged abdominal cramps in mid October, finally got an ultrasound on 11/1, received a limited report on 11/5 (gallstones and sludge) but no follow up or next steps from physician. 

Hi long time lurker, first time poster. After a a couple days of over indulging on my vacation in October I woke up on Oct 13 and had an egg white omelet and juice. An hour later, I started having abdominal cramps and nausea. Thinking food poisoning or something not sitting right, I drank some ginger ale and tried to rest it off. The next day (Oct 14) the cramps were still there and I threw up so I called and set an appointment with an urgent care facility (was not in severe pain, no fever, no other symptoms so did not feel it was ER worthy). The physician on duty did blood work and the only thing he saw was very slight increase in WBC, like a very minimally above normal levels, but otherwise everything was normal. Said it was likely biliary colic and referred me to a different facility to get an ultrasound. He also advised me to not eat fatty food, fried food, spicy food or drink soda which I haven’t. He prescribed something to take as needed (no more than 4x a day) for abdominal cramping. 

Symptoms mostly subsided a couple days later, just felt tired. Fully “myself” by the following Monday (Oct 21).  

Due to confusion on the referral department’s end I wasn’t able to get that scheduled until 18 days after my visit to urgent care, and by that point was exhibiting no symptoms. The ultrasound on the morning of Nov 1 went well and they told me that they would send me a limited report but the full detailed report and scans would go to the physician who made the referral and he should loop back with me. They said they couldn’t discuss anything at length with me but “nothing emergent otherwise we’d be wheeling you over to the ER right now haha”. 

That afternoon I start having a slight discomfort in my lower right ribs, not a squeezing feeling, and not sharp or intense. Just kind of like…there, a perpetual literal annoyance in my side (level of “pain”is generally a 0.5-1.5 on a scale of 0-10, not hurting just. There.)

On Nov 5 I get the limited report. All other organs observed are healthy. Gallbladder shows stones and sludge (no info on size, amt, etc). No thickening of wall (not inflamed/infected?) and no built up fluid. 

I still haven’t heard from the physician so I haven’t been able to tell him about this stitch in my side feeling. And I found out on Saturday when I called that he won’t be back at the office until this upcoming Sunday (Nov 17) so 16 days after I get the ultrasound that wasn’t done until 18 days after I started showing symptoms. I mean I guess it’s good that nothing is emergent, but I’m uncomfortable and always so scared that I’m going to have one of those full blown big attacks that sends me to the ER for emergency surgery.

Aside from the discomfort in my right lower rib, there are no other symptoms. Stools are fine, urine is fine, no fever, no nausea, no vomiting, no jaundice, no extreme weight loss (I’ve lost 9 pounds in 30 days, so about 2-3 lbs a week). I’m still eating the diet recommended from Oct 14, so no fried food, no red meat at all actually, mostly low fat foods with fiber and protein. And lots of fruits and veggies. I haven’t had a coffee in almost a month, sticking to green tea or black tea with no sugar or cream. Plenty of water. 

So I guess this is mostly venting but what else can I do to get the ball rolling? Because the things I read about on here make it seem like time is of the essence and I just want to get better. 

Any advice on the rib feeling? I’ve alternated ice and heat, baths, long showers. Trying to not be heavily reliant on ibuprofen, don’t need an ulcer on top of everything else. ",2,1731438295.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I mostly brew lighter roasts so as soon as water hits the puck, it mushrooms up and out of the basket.

Currently I've been sitting the basket in the top of the moka pot to bloom, then discarding whatever minimal amount of liquid makes it's way through the bed, before assembly and brewing. Because of how much the bed expands I can't get much water in, so I'm likely not even saturating the puck fully.

My brew method is based on James Hoffman's technique, using a paper filter, pre-heating the water, and cooling the base once the bulk of the brew is completed. 

Does anyone have an effective (and cleaner/more enjoyable) way to bloom lighter roasts in the basket? 
I've been considering the E&B filter, instead of the paper filter and using a baister to inject my blooming liquid in through the brew flute of the moka pot once it's all assembled. That way the mesh filter can act more like a shower screen, vs the paper filter, which restricts water flow. 

Any thoughts, experiences or ideas worth exploring would be much appreciated!",2,1731438239.0,mokapot,1,0.75,False

As the title says, I'm 39 White Male, sounds so clinical. I am LF a female friend to go on Dates with. It would typically be during the weekdays with the occasional weekend. Things like coffee and a walk in the park, cooking class, orchards, breweries, and plays. I need an emotional connection before I will get physical and not every time that we hang out will or must be physical. I am more than happy to hang out with you the person rather than the orifice. (That was supposed to be funny) 

If/When things get physical, I am a very giving partner. I tend to focus on my partner rather than myself. My pleasure is appreciated, but I get off on you getting off. I don't have a size preference in women, I love all types, but prefer thick girls, but that doesn't disqualify anyone. Again, Personality over Physical. I ask that you are A) Clean - both sexually and otherwise. Washes their pits and teeth! Lol you'd be surprised. B) Non-smoker - I'm allergic to chemicals in cigarettes and an epi-pen situation doesn't make for a good date. C) Between the ages of 26 and 55. Age divided by 2 plus 6 for starting age. Age divided by 2, plus your age for ceiling, thems the rules. 

Ideal date after we've known each other for a while: we go out to dinner, have great conversation, and feel the vibe. We come back to mine or yours and I spend the next few hours wearing your thighs as ear muffs. (I LOVE giving oral.)

I get tested every quarter and expect the same if we aren't exclusive. I don't play without condoms. 

Ok here's the other shoe, so to speak lol:

I am happily married for over 8yrs, together for 10yrs. She and I practice ENM and have been for 2yrs now. She and I play separately, she has her partners and I have mine. I only ever have one partner at a time. No particular reason just the way I do things. I just don't like to divide my attention too much. Yes, she knows that I'm on here and asking. Yes, you can ask her or meet her whenever you wish once we get to know each other better. No need to bother her if it isn't going to work out. My wife and I are emotionally monogamous, meaning that I will care for you deeply, but it shall be as a friend.

What do you get out of it?
A safe and sane partner, who doesn't pressure you and respects boundaries. I am very communicative both in and out of the bedroom. Someone who can and will explore things we're both into even if I haven't tried it before, like Ethiopian food - I wanna try it, but haven't had the opportunity. Someone who texts you back when you text, someone who actually gives a shit what happens in your day.
If you live close to me, then I offer the service of drive-by kisses, so that even if we can't hang out that day then at least I got to kiss you that day. (They are super fun!) I don't care about your sexual experience, if any, as I said I am very patient and willing to progress at your speed.

What if I find someone, while we are together?
We can end what we have or we can continue, so long as the other person knows. I won't be a side-piece! I will respect you and expect the same. I recognize that every person offers a different type of emotional energy and that no one person can or should be expected to meet that standard. To me that's unrealistic and unfair to them.

Best case scenario - I'd like something consistent, like a least a year or more (dating is exhausting); however, I am open to shorter scenarios.

Not interested in ONS.

Since she was the only female in our office, everyone used to take care of her with respect, including me. To summarize, I noticed that she has interest in me. I was not into this thing, however, I started dropping her to her home, and on the way we used to go to cafes to have coffee together. She started opening up herself to me. However every second day I used to ignore her. Because I was not ready for this thing. These reasons were she was from a completely different background, Eastern European, and me from South Asia. Every time we go to cafe, she used to show her intentions that she want to different places, even though I understood it, I used to ignore what she was saying. 
Once I ignored her for whole month as well. But after a month I started dropping her again. Last Wednesday was the last time I dropped her to home. While sitting in cafe I realized that probably it’s my last chance with her and she has made her mind. Again I ignored her few signal, and then we went back to our homes, this was the first time she didn’t shook her hand with me even though I brought on my hand infront of her. 



The reality is that even I liked her, because she was so kind and beautiful, I loved each and every moment I spent with her. And I realized it more when I lost her. 
 Now she don’t reply to my messages, she ignores me in office. I requested her if we can meet for 10 minutes only and that I wanted ti tell her something. She agreed, we went to a cafe, I opened up my heart and thoughts to her. I told her that I loved each and every moment I had spent with her and want to continue. She completely ignored me if we had anything between us, and asked me have she ever given me any message like this.

I am so much sad, I am actually in pain. I have contacted her again one time but she doesn’t reply back to my messages anymore. It’s just one time after that. Now I realized how much I like her, how much I miss her laugh, how precious she was to me. 

Is there anything I can do to get her back? I never wanted to lose her again.",1,1731437949.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1gpsdq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gpsdq1/social_media_app_idea_a_hyperlocal_community/,Social Media App Idea: A Hyper-Local Community Focused App,"**Hey Reddit!** 👋

**I’ve been brainstorming an idea for a new social app, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it, especially from anyone who’s feels like they want to be apart of a community. Here’s the concept:**

**The App Idea:**

**Imagine an app where you can connect with local people who share your hobbies and interests, but the main focus is on hyper-local, spontaneous meetups. Users would input their interests (e.g., streetwear, fitness, gaming, music, art, etc.) you can go really niche with this, and they can join communities around those passions. From there, you can engage with others in real-time, organize small, impromptu events, and even meet up IRL for shared experiences.**

  
**What Makes It Different?**

  
**There are a few key ways this app would differentiate itself from existing apps like Meetup, Eventbrite, or Facebook Events, including:**



**1. Hyper-Local Focus:**

**• Why it’s different: Meetup and similar platforms are great for larger events, but often they lack the ability to connect people for smaller, local meetups. I want this app to focus on finding events within a very tight radius — so you can connect with people right in your neighborhood and even nearby locations. You can also make posts and chat to other people in these communities, like Reddit.**

**• Example: Let’s say you’re in the mood for a quick streetwear swap, impromptu jam session, or a casual workout. You can hop onto the app and instantly find a community or individual in your area who’s also free and interested in doing something now.**

**2. Gamification of Events:**

**• Why it’s different: To make meetups more exciting and engaging, I want to incorporate gamified elements into the experience. Think of it like a badge system or event challenges. Users can earn points or rewards for attending events, organizing meetups, or engaging with the community. This would not only encourage people to get involved more but also keep the experience fun and dynamic.**

**• Example: If you organize a meet-up or participate in an event, you earn points. Over time, you can unlock perks or even exclusive community-based content or badges. Gamification would also create a more loyal, active user base who feels more invested in the community.**

**3. Spontaneity and Real-Time Interaction:**

**• Why it’s different: Meetup often focuses on scheduled events weeks or months in advance, but this app would prioritize spontaneous, last-minute meetups—like texting your friends to hang out, but with the added bonus of discovering new people to meet based on shared interests.**

**•Example: If you’re free this afternoon and want to go for a coffee with someone who loves streetwear, you can hop on the app and quickly connect with others who might be available, too. If you can’t find something already scheduled, you can post your own spontaneous event and see who joins in.**

**4. Niche Community-Centric:**

**• Why it’s different: Instead of broad “city-wide” groups, this app would foster more niche, hobby-based communities. Whether you’re a gamer, artist, runner, or lover of a certain type of music, you’d find specific communities based around your exact interests. These communities would also have the freedom to self-organize and create smaller, more personalized events.**

**• Example: A user who loves streetwear can connect with others who want to do things like shopping hauls, street photography meetups, or collaborative design events. Likewise, a runner could find or create a small, local running group that’s always open to new members.**

**5. Event Suggestions Based on Real-Time Availability:**

**• Why it’s different: Rather than relying on users to browse through events scheduled far in advance, this app would use algorithms to suggest meetups based on both your interests and your immediate availability. For example, if you’re free today and want to join something, the app would suggest meetups happening soon near you.**

**• Example: Let’s say you’ve got an hour free and want to join something impromptu. The app would offer suggestions for meetups that are about to happen, with a strong focus on hyper-local, in-the-moment events.**

**6. Intuitive and User-Friendly Event Creation:**

**• Why it’s different: Event creation would be extremely easy and require no upfront planning or rigid structures. Users could quickly make events, invite a few people, and get together for smaller experiences that don’t require a ton of preparation or resources.**

**• Example: A quick get-together could be something as simple as “Streetwear Meetup: Trading sneakers at the park at 2pm today!” You can quickly create and share these events with just a few taps, and others can join in on the spot.**

**7. Value for Local Businesses: This app isn’t just for users—local businesses benefit too. They’ll have opportunities to engage with community members by organizing or sponsoring meetups. Imagine a coffee shop hosting a game night or a local sports shop setting up a running club meetup—both benefiting from increased foot traffic and brand visibility.**

  
**So, What’s the Value Proposition?**

**• Convenience: Users will be able to instantly connect with like-minded people, making real-world connections easier than ever.**

**• Excitement: Gamifying meetups and focusing on spontaneous events creates a sense of adventure and encourages more participation.**

**• Community: It’s all about finding your tribe—whether it’s based on your hobbies, location, or personal interests, the app helps build a deeper sense of connection.**

**• Flexibility: The app makes event creation and participation super easy, with a real-time experience that lets people be more spontaneous without the pressure of long-term planning.**

**Questions for the Community:**

**1. Do you think there’s a gap in the market for this sort of hyper-local app that focuses on connection?**

**2. Would you be interested in connecting with people in your area who share your hobbies and interests in real-time?**

**3. What features would you want to see in an app like this to make it more useful or engaging?**

**I’m really excited to get some feedback and hear what you think! If you’ve used apps like Meetup or Eventbrite, what do you think is missing or could be improved? Feel free to comment below with your thoughts!**

  
**Thanks in advance for the feedback!** 🙏

**TL;DR**

A new app idea, where people join hyperlocal communities based on shared interests and connect through spontaneous, gamified meetups. It offers value to users by fostering real-world connections and helps local businesses engage with customers in authentic ways.

1gpscgl,https://v.redd.it/qy42btkbpi0e1,"In need of help from all ya Navi Wizards - clutch woes & lurching - Columbus, Oh","TLDR
Lost job. Navi is out of commission. In need of help. This week blows.
 
Problem(s)
s23 clutch
a) Bike is slightly puling forward when stopped at a light or sign. It feels like a toddler is behind me and trying to push the bike forward. Like I can feel the bike slightly lurching forward but, I dont have to keep the brake on. My weight and my feet on the ground were enough to keep the bike in place.
b) The back wheel is acting strangely. When it is on the stand and idling that back wheels spins WAY faster than I have ever seen. If i put my hand or foot on it I can stop it but, I can feel WAY more force on the spin. When I take it off of the stand and try to push the bike I can feel that back wheel wanting to lock up. Checked the brakes - as far as I can tell - they are fine and in working order.

s23 variator
a) I am a big dumb-dumb. When installing the variator, I accidently stripped the one of the bolts behind the variator that was holding the gasket or bracket (i think that's what it is) in place. The new varitor hits the old screws and wont spin. I installed the old variator back in but, that stripped bolt is, like, maybe one to two full rotations for to be tight on that gasket/bracket. It spins and I feel like it is working okay but, there is still like 1mm of wiggle room and the gasket/bracket will click if I tap on it.

Diagnostic(s)
s23 Clutch
a & b) I think this has to be my major problem. Take this with a grain of salt, as I am only a fledgling gear-head, but I can see no reason why the vairitor would be causing this problem to the back wheel. When I installed the clutch I did not have a torque wrench but, i did use an impack drill and socket to take the old one off and, to tighten the new one on. It rode fine but then I realized that I wanted to change the springs. So I took off the new clutch, opened it up, swapped springs and the, had a battle to the death with it trying to get the clamps to slide back over the face plate and into the little groves on the three pegs. In the end I had to use a pair of vice grips to force the base plate down far enough down so I could slide the little C shaped clamps on to the pegs. I feel I didn't bend or force the face plate and I double checked to make sure all the springs were properly installed.

Currently it's raining and all my tools are back at my art studio/makeshift garage and I am not gonna be able to open the Navi up to have a look see until tomorrow. Maybe I'm wrong but, what I am guessing is that i did not properly bring that clutch's nut down tight enough. Or maybe it was TOO tight?

Again, do not have a mechanic's brain but this FEELS like it has to be the source of the problem.

What do I know? I'm a fucking artist. Haha.

c) This one is easy: I need to remove that damn stripped bolt! Easy, no? Weeelll...
To be honest, I know that this is an easy fix but I am very nervious of drilling out that bolt and using and easy out. I know what I have to do. I understand the process but, it's something that I have never done before and I do not want to fuck up my Navi. I have the tools but fear that I do not have the skills.

I have also already tried using a chisel to create an cross for a Philips head as well as using the chisel and hammer to remove the bolt. All that I ended up doing was making the bolt worse and chipping my chisel.

Solution(s)
You tell me!!

I won’t lie, it sure would be rad if any local good sam wanted to check my work, let me know what I did wrong and, help oversee getting it back to tip top condition. Bonus points if they also would like to help me remove that stripped bolt. Should local (Columbus, Ohio) feel the need to help a stranger out of a real fucking sour bind, I would most deffintaly pay for your help & troubles. 

The last thing I want to do right now is take it into a shop, drop more money than I have and, not learn a damn thing about what I did wrong or how to fix it in the future. 

But truthfully, any help given is an opportunity for growth and knowledge and new skills.

Ive already came this far; aint no way I’m going back!
***

Backstory:
My 2024 Navi is somewhat out of commission and I need help getting it back up and running. For the past 20 years I have been living in either chicago or brooklyn - so, not much need for a car or personal transportation. Last year I moved back to Columbus Oh (Franklinton) and managed to find a job that was within walking distance. I knew I wasnt going to stay in Frank for another year, so when my lease was close to being up and I was looking at new hoods & cribs, I also started doing the research on what sort of transportation I needed to get. Had a little bit of money saved but not enough for a car that wasn’t already falling apart or something that I would have to pump more money into. 

Dont know how i got to the point where I thought that buying a motorcycle was the best decision for me but, that’s exactly where I landed. The Navi was in my price range, it had extra storage and, from what I had read and watched, was easy to learn how to do maintenance on the bike. I just turned 46 last month and had never done any sort of automotive mechanical work at all. Hell, I often joked and called mechanics modern day wizards & sorcerers - the work they did was just a magical as any level 20 wizard casting True Polymorph on the engine to restore it to its former glory.

But here we are now. 3 months after buying a 2024 Navi and I am fucking hooked. I want to become a wizard like ya’ll. I’ve learned and taught myself a few ‘spells’ already: I changed the headlight, added underlights, changed the oil, swapped shocks, installed a new exhaust and, im currently working on a custom paint job for this little bastard. I really feel like I have become a fledgling wizard’s apprentice. My bike was becoming closer and closer to what I wanted it to be. Just two more mods and I would have the bike the way I wanted it.  So I picked up the s23 Clutch and Variator kit form Scooter Swap Shop. 

Perhaps it was my own hubris but I thought that installing these mods wouldn’t be that big of a deal. I mean, I was already an apprentice - surely I got this, ya? 
Naw, mate! I done fucked this spell up and I have no counter magic, no Dumbledore or Gandol as mentors, no fellowship to guide and protect. This is an isekai of my own design and I want out!

I really need to get this bike back up and running so I can continue to do delivery while I am looking for another full time job. I am hoping that someone here will be able to offer some form of help/support. 

*EDIT
Took apart the bike again to a few pics and vids to help figure what was going on. When I removed the casing and spun the clutch, it was making a bit of a grinding//scratching sound. 
Removed the clutch and it felt like there was a little bit of give between where the belt rests and the back of the clutch. I tried runing the impact on it, thinking that I do not remember it being that way but, it did not change. Nothing looked out of place. Did a lil bit of cleaning and put the parts back on and turn her on to see if everything looks okay. So far, things looks and sound good. 

Frustrated, because I cant figure out what was going on or why things feel and sound like they are back to normal, I put the bike back together and leave her on idol for about 10 mins. Okaaaay, I dont know why things look and feel good now but they do, so I cut the engin, go get my gear and take her out for a lil spin around the block.  No issues, so I ride to the studio (about 10 mins away) to work on some art stuff. Come home a bit later and still not a problem. I feel good but I still do not know what the problem was; go to bed & sleep like a baby.

Woke up today and headed to the coffee shop to finish writing this up and post the pics & vids and ask for help from anyone that might be able to offer saged advice. The coffee shop is about a 5 min ride but when I stop to trun into the parking lot, I feel it again: the slight lurching.

I take a slight break from typing this edit to check on the back wheel. While it is idling, it looks like the back wheel is rotating much faster than i remember it. With it on the stand I did not feel it trying to push forward slightly but, I guess that just might be because I have it on the stand. I did not hear any odd sounds or strange vibrations

Anxious about the short ride home but, its not far and will give me a better idea if the same problems are going to happen again. Please cross your electronic fingers for me.

1gpsa1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1gpsa1u/social_media_app_idea_a_hyperlocal_community/,Social Media App Idea: A Hyper-Local Community Focused App,"**Hey Reddit!** 👋

  


**I’ve been brainstorming an idea for a new social app, and I’d love to get your thoughts on it, especially from anyone who’s feels like they want to be apart of a community. Here’s the concept:**

  


**The App Idea:**

  


**Imagine an app where you can connect with local people who share your hobbies and interests, but the main focus is on hyper-local, spontaneous meetups. Users would input their interests (e.g., streetwear, fitness, gaming, music, art, etc.) you can go really niche with this, and they can join communities around those passions. From there, you can engage with others in real-time, organize small, impromptu events, and even meet up IRL for shared experiences.**

  


**What Makes It Different?**

  


**There are a few key ways this app would differentiate itself from existing apps like Meetup, Eventbrite, or Facebook Events, including:**

  


**1. Hyper-Local Focus:**

  


**• Why it’s different: Meetup and similar platforms are great for larger events, but often they lack the ability to connect people for smaller, local meetups. I want this app to focus on finding events within a very tight radius — so you can connect with people right in your neighborhood and even nearby locations. You can also make posts and chat to other people in these communities, like Reddit.**

**• Example: Let’s say you’re in the mood for a quick streetwear swap, impromptu jam session, or a casual workout. You can hop onto the app and instantly find a community or individual in your area who’s also free and interested in doing something now.**

  


**2. Gamification of Events:**

  


**• Why it’s different: To make meetups more exciting and engaging, I want to incorporate gamified elements into the experience. Think of it like a badge system or event challenges. Users can earn points or rewards for attending events, organizing meetups, or engaging with the community. This would not only encourage people to get involved more but also keep the experience fun and dynamic.**

**• Example: If you organize a meet-up or participate in an event, you earn points. Over time, you can unlock perks or even exclusive community-based content or badges. Gamification would also create a more loyal, active user base who feels more invested in the community.**

  


**3. Spontaneity and Real-Time Interaction:**

  


**• Why it’s different: Meetup often focuses on scheduled events weeks or months in advance, but this app would prioritize spontaneous, last-minute meetups—like texting your friends to hang out, but with the added bonus of discovering new people to meet based on shared interests.**

**•Example: If you’re free this afternoon and want to go for a coffee with someone who loves streetwear, you can hop on the app and quickly connect with others who might be available, too. If you can’t find something already scheduled, you can post your own spontaneous event and see who joins in.**

  


**4. Niche Community-Centric:**

  


**• Why it’s different: Instead of broad “city-wide” groups, this app would foster more niche, hobby-based communities. Whether you’re a gamer, artist, runner, or lover of a certain type of music, you’d find specific communities based around your exact interests. These communities would also have the freedom to self-organize and create smaller, more personalized events.**

**• Example: A user who loves streetwear can connect with others who want to do things like shopping hauls, street photography meetups, or collaborative design events. Likewise, a runner could find or create a small, local running group that’s always open to new members.**

  


**5. Event Suggestions Based on Real-Time Availability:**

  


**• Why it’s different: Rather than relying on users to browse through events scheduled far in advance, this app would use algorithms to suggest meetups based on both your interests and your immediate availability. For example, if you’re free today and want to join something, the app would suggest meetups happening soon near you.**

**• Example: Let’s say you’ve got an hour free and want to join something impromptu. The app would offer suggestions for meetups that are about to happen, with a strong focus on hyper-local, in-the-moment events.**

  


**6. Intuitive and User-Friendly Event Creation:**

  


**• Why it’s different: Event creation would be extremely easy and require no upfront planning or rigid structures. Users could quickly make events, invite a few people, and get together for smaller experiences that don’t require a ton of preparation or resources.**

**• Example: A quick get-together could be something as simple as “Streetwear Meetup: Trading sneakers at the park at 2pm today!” You can quickly create and share these events with just a few taps, and others can join in on the spot.**

  


**7. Value for Local Businesses: This app isn’t just for users—local businesses benefit too. They’ll have opportunities to engage with community members by organizing or sponsoring meetups. Imagine a coffee shop hosting a game night or a local sports shop setting up a running club meetup—both benefiting from increased foot traffic and brand visibility.**

  


**So, What’s the Value Proposition?**

  


**• Convenience: Users will be able to instantly connect with like-minded people, making real-world connections easier than ever.**

**• Excitement: Gamifying meetups and focusing on spontaneous events creates a sense of adventure and encourages more participation.**

**• Community: It’s all about finding your tribe—whether it’s based on your hobbies, location, or personal interests, the app helps build a deeper sense of connection.**

**• Flexibility: The app makes event creation and participation super easy, with a real-time experience that lets people be more spontaneous without the pressure of long-term planning.**

  


**Questions for the Community:**

  


**1. Do you think there’s a gap in the market for this sort of hyper-local app that focuses on connection?**

**2. Would you be interested in connecting with people in your area who share your hobbies and interests in real-time?**

**3. What features would you want to see in an app like this to make it more useful or engaging?**

  


**I’m really excited to get some feedback and hear what you think! If you’ve used apps like Meetup or Eventbrite, what do you think is missing or could be improved? Feel free to comment below with your thoughts!**

  


**Thanks in advance for the feedback!** 🙏

  


**TL;DR**

A new app idea, where people join hyperlocal communities based on shared interests and connect through spontaneous, gamified meetups. It offers value to users by fostering real-world connections and helps local businesses engage with customers in authentic ways.

I’ll spend most of my time around the city and I’ve never really ventured outside of Tassie so I’m after recommendations that may be exciting for someone from my small island state! 

I’m 23 so I’m after little pleasures like vintage stores, cool photo opportunities similar to Hosier Lane,  good Melbourne coffee or cool food experiences (Grazeland?) I plan on doing a lot of walking but am also not interested in tours or anything like that as I’d like to do that at a time when I can plan my travels better/appreciate it a little more. But for now, I’m looking forward to dilly-dallying around Melbourne, trying Starbucks for the first time (please tell me if it’s not worth it!) and going to Sephora 🤣

Not planning anything nature/tour related as I’d like to save that for when I have better planning and have time to take it all in & appreciate it properly. 

Any other travel tips would also be greatly appreciated for a woman travelling interstate for the first time, and first time alone!

1gps7rb,https://youtu.be/XQb2Cnl1pqI?si=ZsHMqidYHF08ah1Z,Top 10 P5R Songs: #10,"Persona 5 Royal is my favorite video game of all time. Which that in it of itself is surprising to me cause I haven't even had the game for 6 months 😂

This game has changed my entire perspective of the type of games I play and I couldn't be any more grateful for it. Up till I started playing P5R, all I played was wrestling games and Mortal Kombat 💀

My only regret is that I didn't discover this game when I was actually in high school 😂

I love this game but besides the characters and their interactions, my favorite part of this game is the music.

There's not a single bad song in the game which made this list much more difficult to do.

I decided that a post will be dedicated to one song so there will be 10 posts in total.

I truly want to talk about each song and analyze it and I feel like this's the best way to do it.

Honorable mentions will be posted after #1 is revealed.

With all this out of the way, let's start with #10!


#10: Alleycat
I'm not too sure if this's a surprise to anyone but I just have such a soft spot for this one.

I have those same feelings about another song on this list but we'll get to that when we get to it.

I know this song's kinda a meme but I still love it.

I love the vibe it gives off. It's on the sadder side but in a strange sense, it's also kinda motivating.

This song usually plays whenever the characters are talking about their feelings about themselves or things going on around them.

I do find it unintentionally hilarious when Ren and a Confidant are having a good time and then the Confidant would suddenly start confiding in Ren about their problems or their checkered past and the song suddenly starts playing.

Like it's legitimately out of nowhere sometimes 😂

But I feel it's best used in the arc revolving around Futaba's Palace.

Sojiro Sakura is a very interesting character to me. Besides being a damn machine when it comes to making coffee and curry, he cares deeply about Futaba.

And before we really start exploring her Palace, we learn more about her current situation from Boss.

Alleycat plays throughout this whole scene and it really works. You can feel Sojiro's pain when he tells Futaba's story and with Alleycat playing in the background, you just feel sorry for him.

Allycat's a really good song and the highlight for me is that piano. I'm a sucker for piano so my bias is probably showing a bit but it still doesn't take away from the song itself.

Overall I can't say enough good things about it and I will always get this slight sense of hope from it.

What do you guys think of Alleycat?",1,1731437511.0,Persona5,0,0.99,False

","In the healthcare field, every day can bring new challenges and long hours, and the demands of the job often leave little room for comfort concerns. For healthcare professionals, the right scrubs can make a significant difference. Many professionals are drawn to [navy blue medical scrubs set](https://wearmartae.com/navy-blue-scrubs/), a color that reflects both professionalism and reliability. But beyond aesthetics, scrubs' comfort and functionality help healthcare workers thrive throughout the day.

**The Comfort Factor**

Comfort is a top priority when choosing scrubs, especially during those whirlwind shifts with non-stop patients and documentation. Comfortable scrubs can reduce physical stress, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on their tasks without feeling weighed down. Soft, breathable fabrics that move with the body make long shifts easier, and they help prevent the common issue of stiff or restrictive attire midway through a shift. Navy blue scrubs designed with athletic fabrics, moisture-wicking properties, and flexible cuts help maintain energy levels and alleviate the discomfort associated with standard scrubs \[[1](https://shopdolan.com/blogs/dolan-blog/scrub-color-psychology-how-color-affects-patients-and-staff?srsltid=AfmBOooSe0S5-LiUreKx6vL9YC6usfSnwGb0P1boFoZvYlBlF7mwO_lk)\].

**The Influence on Patient Perception**

Color psychology plays a key role in healthcare settings. Navy blue has long been associated with qualities like trust and authority, which helps foster patient confidence. When patients see a medical professional in navy scrubs, they tend to feel more at ease. This sense of trust is invaluable in the high-stakes world of healthcare. A patient’s confidence in their caregiver is often linked to their perception of the caregiver’s competence and compassion—qualities that can be subconsciously reinforced by color \[[6](https://snibbs.co/blogs/healthcare-best-practices/scrub-colors-meaning?srsltid=AfmBOor-WybYuE4-dBH0BUYiUpzui0lvozm-FCgFx1-qXHRB3SeaQ0Ed)\].

**Functionality and Practicality in Design**

A day in healthcare is filled with tasks that require movement, agility, and sometimes quick responses. This is where the practicality of navy blue scrubs comes in. Modern scrubs are often designed with functional elements, such as multiple pockets and reinforced seams, to hold essentials like pens, medical tools, and notepads. Additionally, high-quality scrubs provide durability, standing up to the frequent wash cycles necessary for hygiene. The strong, dark hue of navy blue also helps mask stains, which is a practical benefit for healthcare workers dealing with the unpredictable realities of patient care \[[5](https://www.pulseuniform.com/coffee-time/unveiling-scrub-secrets-surgical-nursing-insights/?srsltid=AfmBOoqMpt3UOzp8vhDZyAgEvpp4l-gZHSt9IPzJ9-daZUDlV-77_RbT)\].

**Why Navy Blue Scrubs Stand Out**

The rise of functional, comfortable navy blue scrubs showcases the healthcare industry’s shift toward prioritizing the well-being of its workforce. For healthcare professionals, wearing comfortable scrubs that foster confidence and allow ease of movement is essential to getting through the demands of the day. With the right attire, a challenging shift can feel manageable, if not a little bit easier. For professionals looking for comfort, style, and reliability in one package, navy blue scrubs remain a timeless and practical choice.",1,1731437310.0,u_Apprehensive-Log3134,0,1.0,False

So my dad works 3 jobs, not by choice, but because he enjoys it. And to make it clear, it is not 3 jobs to support a living, he makes an affluent amount of money. He works 3 jobs, which are all different companies he has co-founded. My dad has expressed several times and openly admits that he has a work addiction, yes that is a thing, because he thoroughly enjoys what he does. With that, he is always working and never has down time.

She met a man (not sure where, I know her works near where she works) who she describes as a “thug who is really just a big softie”. She’s said she knows he isn’t a real option for dating because she’d never be able to introduce him to her family due to his criminal record. 

His record includes several automobile violations and several counts of assault, including strangulation. 

Although she has said she recognizes she should not actually date him, she’s very clearly trying to bullshit me and herself. She’s talking about him more and more, spending time with him every chance she gets, baking for him, and now he’s been to her house. 

From how she describes it, she seems to believe she’s the exception and he’s very protective of her and she loves that. He brings her coffee at work and shows interest in her hobbies (how everyone behaves at the start of a relationship) and she always caps it off with “I’m not ignoring the other stuff in telling you the good things, just so you know”.

I’m usually able to be patient and listen when she calls to talk about her relationships but this time I frankly do not want to hear it. I have a personal history with DV with a partner who put his hands around my neck twice, amongst other things. Hearing her brush it under the rug like this is not only triggering me, but I feel angry at her willfully ignorance. 

How can I bring this up and tell her I don’t want to hear about this man anymore? I’ve expressed concern and had the “I absolutely will not support this” attitude and she laughs it off because those rose tinted glasses are real. I have not expressed my discomfort in regard to my own experiences, I honestly didn’t think I would have to. I’m not 100% sure if she knows about this specific part of my past. 

I want to be here for her and I am worried about her but she is making choices right now and obviously I can’t control her. I just can’t listen to it anymore and I’m not sure how to approach the conversation. Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR my friend is newly seeing a man with a history of violent physical abuse and is talking him up for most of the duration of our conversations.

I never had the chance to let him know about that because we have a common friend (26F) who openly expresses her feelings toward the guy. She liked him since they were in high school. Nobody knew about what I felt. We were teased and paired by other friends but I never really said a word.  

Fast forward.
The mutual friend confessed her decade long feelings toward the guy last July. To make it short, she was appreciated for what she did but the guy said he only see her as a friend. Why do I know this? I am really close to the mutual friend. 

I did not push through with my feelings to the guy out of respect to our mutual friend. I don't wanna hurt her. Never will. But I have this growing feelings for the guy friend. Like it got a lot more bigger when I heard about him 'rejecting' the mutual friend. Him and I also get along really well. Just recently, he started annoying me in a way that is not really annoying, idk if you guys get what I mean - he's just getting my attention maybe. We do church ministry together. He encourage me a lot especially in my craft. He offers help when I don't even ask. Always asking how's my day, my week, my weekend, and my quality of sleep when we're together. We hang around in 3's. Went out once for a coffee together, weren't able to talk comfortably so after 20 mins, we called another friend to hangout with us. Lol. It was really funny, we can't even look at each other's eyes for long. 

TL;DR When the mutual friend confessed, they became closer but nothing romantic. We also became closer and my gut feeling says that ours is more than platonic.

Should I let him know about what I feel? Too soon or I have to wait? Or I shouldn't and wait until the feelings fade away? I know I'm old enough but I need help on this. Hahahaha",1,1731437154.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

He has women over all the time and literally plows them for hours while I have to listen to the screaming.

I had a girl over recently, and I busted in like 2 minutes, it was super awkward when we then heard my dad pleasing his latest bitch for what seemed like hours. Normally I would try to go for round 2, but my confidence was shot, and I just went to sleep. She left in the morning and ghosted me.

About a week later I come in from work and hear my dad fucking yet another hoe, the moaning was new before but nothing unusual. I went in to make a cup of coffee an hour later and who walks out of his room in just a thong and a little crop top. The girl who ghosted me of course.

It was absolutely brutal and I lost my shit, I confronted my dad and said ""what the hell, not only was that my girl, shes only 19, you are old enough to be her father"". And he just laughed and said ""thats the way the cookie crumbles, son"".

So long story short, my dad is mogging me out of existence, Ive seen him walking around while erect and hes huge, must be almost 8 inches while mine is only 4.75 and has no stamina, why did god do to this me, I didnt deserve this life, no one does.",1,1731437128.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.6,False

So far the friends I've made have all come about kinda ""by circumstance"". Happen to sit together in class, share a work area long enough, etc. Things develop slowly over time, and usually because of enough time spent with the person, we'd become ""friends"" or good acquaintances. Nothing really came about deliberately.

I'm in the ""late-20s/early 30s"" range and over the past several years there have been several occasions where I'd meet new people at work from our seasonal hires (usually college age; I work at a university). But because these positions are short-term, it's hard to build any sort of friendship with these folks, especially as an ""older"" person with ""adult responsibilities"".

This school term I've managed to exchange numbers with someone after only talking a few times (though they probably gave their number out of pressure/obligation because they are ""too nice""). I'm super grateful to have their contact but I know they are getting super busy now with exams etc so I don't want to become a bother to them. I have plans to reach out again in the new year/new term (before exams kick in again), but I'm kinda worried I'd screw it up and scared them off (which I've done in the past, regretfully).

How are folks like me supposed to make friends in a situation like this? Do I ask them to grab a coffee? Or is that kinda weird (or reserved for dates / close friends)??

How do I know if they care about this ""friendship"" if I'm obviously the only one initiating? How can I show that I can be a good friend without appearing desperate?

It feels especially hard because they are mostly making friends with classmates etc and it just seems weird for them to care about a friendship with ""some dude from work"".

1gprw5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1gprw5o/rant_lived_in_hell_for_5_years_and_exroommate/,Rant: lived in hell for 5 years and ex-roommate left me with a $500 fine!,"Hi all. Throwaway account bc I don't want this post tied to my regular one. This is gonna be kinda long (sorry in advance).

I've lived in my apartment for 17 years now. It's rent stabilized and I spent a lot of money over the years buying furniture and paint to make it into a home and a place people would want to hang out in. About 5 years ago my previous roommate/subletter of 6 years moved across the country for a job. We'd become really close friends so I was devastated and anxious about having to start over with a new stranger, so when one of my closest friends in the city asked if he could take the room, I was excited about it.

Almost immediately after moving in, my friend (I'll call him Parker) started giving me problems. I made a comment a few weeks in about wanting to find a place for his stuff so his boxes weren't just sitting in the living room and he responded with ""what I'm hearing is that there's no place for me in this apartment."" From there we had several arguments where I'd say something benign and he'd interpret my words wildly and almost gaslightingly different from what I was saying (I'd say up and he'd interpret it as down). He was also sober when he moved in. He'd told me years prior that he thought he had a drinking problem and he hadn't had a drink in a year or more. That quickly changed as he started getting more and more involved in the nightlife scene in our neighborhood and in less than a year he was coming home blackout drunk. He urinated on my couch one night and had to pay for it to be professionally steam-cleaned. This eventually led to a night where my landlord called me at 4AM to tell me he was so drunk he couldn't get up the stairs to our apartment and he'd had to be helped up and could I bring him into the apartment. He was so hammered I couldn't get him past the front hall of our apartment. This led to a huge confrontation the next morning where I ripped into him. It was a mix of ""I will not live with a blackout drunk who pees on my shit and hurts my relationship with my landlord"" and ""I am scared I'm watching my friend kill himself."" To his credit, he immediately quit drinking, went to multiple AA meetings, and told all of his closest friends (including some of the local bartenders) not to give him alcohol or let him drink. He has (to my knowledge) been sober ever since. He apologized profusely and genuinely seemed remorseful but things did not improve.

The other conflict that has existed since pretty soon after he moved in was his mess. He's an artist and constantly complained about not having a studio, needing a space to create his art that wasn't his bedroom, etc. And he would take over the living room coffee table (which was also where we ate, since there's no dining room) and leave projects there for weeks. I asked him not to do that and he'd comply for a week or two and then it would go back. I also, at one point, realized his room had started looking like a hoarder's den. He usually kept his door shut at all times but when he was drinking he'd pass out on the couch and leave his door open and it was FILLED with trash. He claimed it was all art projects but a lot of it was just junk he didn't want to throw out, and what was there wasn't organized in the slightest. It was so bad you couldn't see his bedroom floor or open the door fully. I have no idea how he even slept on his bed because every time I saw it, it was covered in stuff. He also never cleaned (not once). He'd do dishes and take out the trash (the stuff that had a physical presence) but when I asked him to clean the bathroom once early on he said ""can you show me where it's dirty, cuz I don't see it?"" I'd let it get filthy hoping he'd clean it himself before speaking up so it was mind-boggling that he ""didn't see it.""

By the time I'd decided I wanted him to move out, COVID struck and I didn't feel like I could kick him out or find a new roommate in the middle of the quarantine. And then I got laid off from my job. I've been struggling financially since then, but somehow miraculously able to make ends meet, but I was terrified if I asked him to move out, I'd create an untenable financial situation for myself if I couldn't find a new roommate, and I couldn't imagine showing someone his landfill of a room and having them picture moving into it. So I (stupidly) just waited. I finally hit my wits end around May and asked him to move out. He told me he needed ""a few months"" and I feel guilty to say now, but I lost my shit on him and started threatening him. I still feel bad about that and I ended up responding to that by being SUPER chill about his move-out timeline. Then his mom died, and I made sure he knew that if he needed an extra month to save up the money he'd spent on a plane ticket home, he could take it. He was also having trouble finding a new place bc his credit was terrible so I said ""just let me know when your move-out is gonna be and give me 30 days notice.""

He told me in September he was signing a lease that started Oct 1st but he was going to pay me for October and be gone by Nov 1st so he could ""move out slowly over time."" I don't know if that actually happened because by the last week in October it looked like he hadn't packed a thing. Then he told me he couldn't get a moving can until Nov 4th and from November 3 through the 8th he gave me several excuses for why his move was being delayed. If I seemed even a little impatient he got snippy with me and would say ""believe me, I want out of here as much as you want me out"" even though I was being SUPER understanding still. He finally moved the last of his things out by 10:00 on the 8th. On the 9th I received a SCREAMING phone call from my landlord. I hadn't left the apartment the day before but apparently he'd left garbage on the street and whether he left it in that state or not, it was now loose and all over the sidewalk (it looked just like his bedroom). The city had given the building owners a $300 ticket and they'd had to pay $200 for emergency trash pickup to avoid another ticket, which the owners put on me, so I told Parker I was taking it out of his security deposit. He tried to blame literally everyone but himself. ""The landlord's kids moved the trash to that location,"" ""the city must've done it and then said fuck it,"" ""the wind blew it."" I told him it didn't matter because the issue the city had was not just that it was a mess or who made the mess, but that it hadn't been properly secured or stored when it was thrown out.

He'd already told me that he wanted me to take what he owed me for utilities out of his deposit and use some of it to pay to have the room and common areas cleaned, so with this extra $500 going to the landlord (which I've already paid) he's not getting any of his deposit back. I told him I'd provide him with all of the documentation for his records but that I wasn't going to be held financially liable for his mistakes. I don't feel guilty at all, just psychologically exhausted. I've never subscribed to the old ""don't live with friends"" adage. I believe GOOD friends make good roommates but that living with a friend is a great way to find out if they're a bad friend VERY quickly. I should've been more realistic about who my friend was before letting him move in, but I was so blinded by not wanting to live with a stranger again that I ended up in the bad situation I was worried about anyway.

  
TL;DR, my mess of an ex-roommate left me with a $500 fine for improperly disposed of garbage as he moved out, after 5 years of destroying my apt and making my life hell. ",4,1731436722.0,roommates,1,0.84,False

Feel free to direct message me if you need help.



**Day 1:** The Country’s Most Tropical Destination



To get to your first destination, fly to the city of Ho Chi Minh and then take another flight to the island of Phu Quoc. Check out the night market.



**Day 2:** A Day Perfect for Parents Traveling with Kids



As an excursion, we first head to an animal park. After seeing animals such as birds and goats as well as watching a bird show, we are taken into an area of the park that is home to large animals, such as tigers, rhinos and lions. Next, we head to a theme park called VinWonders Phu Quoc. Our day ends at Grand World. This is an Italian-looking entertainment and shopping complex.



**Day 3:** White-Sand Beaches, Clear Waters & Cable Cars



Before returning to and staying in Ho Chi Minh, we go snorkeling. The highlights of the boat cruise are the islands of Mong Tay, Gam Ghi and May Rut. All three are great for swimming. Gam Ghi is where we go snorkeling. We should be at a water park called Hon Thom Island (a.k.a. Pineapple Island) around 3:00pm. We have around 1.5 hours there to play. From the water park, we take the cable car to an architecturally stunning complex known as Sun World. We arrive in Ho Chi Minh in the nighttime.



**Day 4:** Biking, Delta Cruising & Partying



We go on a daytrip today. Firstly, we are taken to Vinh Trang Pagoda. Next, we are taken to the Mekong River Delta. There we go on a boat cruise. Lunch is included on today’s tour and is served at a working farm (a.k.a. farm stay) typically around 12:30pm. At this same working farm, we go on a bike tour. We should be back at our hotel around 5:30pm. We have the rest of the evening to ourselves.



Consider going for a walk, starting with an energy and music-filled street called Nguyen Hue, then to a market called Ben Thanh and then to a street dotted with restaurants called Thai Van Lung. You could then take a quick taxi ride to a nightlife-filled street called Bui Vien. Also worth checking out are the sky bars in the downtown area.



**Day 5:** The Secrets & Tricks of Warfare Followed by a Decorative Bridge & a Night Market



Before relocating by flight to the city of Da Nang, we are provided with a guided Ho Chi Minh city tour. We are then taken to the Cu Chi Tunnels. Here you see exactly how the Vietnam War was fought, with death traps, hidden places and more. We should be arriving in Da Nang in the nighttime. En route to our hotel, we see the so-called Dragon Bridge, which features a rather unique architectural design. After checking into your hotel, we recommend you visit the night market as well as a nearby lounge and club complex called ‘Yachy’. Dress nicely.



**Day 6:** Walking on Marble Mountains & the Country’s Prettiest Town



We make an excursion from Da Nang. Firstly, we are taken to a cluster of five marble and limestone hills. Collectively they are called the Marble Mountains, a.k.a. Ngu Hanh Son. In the early-evening, we are taken to the town of Hoi An. There we are provided with a guided tour. Highlights include a local outdoor market called Nguyen Hoang, traditional homes, pagodas, an assembly hall called Phuc Kien, the Japanese bridge, Hoai River, Lantern Street and the silk shops.



**Day 7:** A Resort Built by French Architects & a Bridge Designed Like No Other



Before relocating by flight from Da Nang to the capital that is Hanoi, we visit a hill station and resort called Ba Na Hill Station (a.k.a. Ba Na Hills). It was founded in 1919 by French colonists. It was built as a leisure destination for French tourists. Being located 1500 meters above sea level, it has a view of the East Sea and the surrounding mountains. We reach this hill station and resort by cable car. In operation since March 29, 2013, it holds the world record for the longest nonstop single track cable car, at 5,801 meters (19,032 feet) in length. Highlights of our tour include the internationally acclaimed Golden Bridge, the garden, and the wine cellar. Another detail worth mentioning is that a buffet-style lunch is included on today’s tour and is served in the charming ‘French Village’, which is reached by cable car.



**Day 8:** Sightseeing in the Capital



Before relocating by land to the town of Ha Giang, we explore Hanoi. Highlights include the Opera House, Ho Tay Lake, Chua Tran Quoc Temple, Temple of Literature, Saint Joseph’s Cathedral and Hoan Kiem Lake (a.k.a. Restored Sword Lake). Hanoi is home to little streets and alleyways with food stalls, as well as restaurants squeezed up next to each other. The city vibe is one that visitors can easily feel and appreciate.



**Day 9:** Scenic Valleys, Winding Roads & Selfies



There is much to see as we relocate today by land from Ha Giang to the village of Dong Van. Firstly, we are taken to Thach Son Than Buckwheat Flowers Fields. It is a perfect spot for taking selfies. Next, we are taken to Quan Ba Heaven Gate. There we can purchase a coffee while overlooking the fine valley. Next, we are taken to Fairy Bosom (a.k.a. Núi đôi Quản Bạ). There we walk to a beautiful lookout point.



Next, we are taken to the settlement of Lung Tam. Upon arrival in Lung Tam, we see how locals do centuries-old weaving and embroidery techniques. Next, we are taken to an observation deck called Đài Quan Sát Yên Minh. Next, we are taken to a viewpoint called Dốc Thẩm Mã. Meeting a local tribe while taking photos of the winding road between the mountains makes for a great 10-minute stop. Before reaching Dong Van, finally we are taken to the Lung Cam Cultural Tourist Village, which is located in the Sung La Valley. There we meet another local tribe.



**Day 10:** An Authentic Outdoor Market, Tribal People & the North’s Picturesque Landscape



Before leaving Dong Van, we walk to a lookout point and then visit two local markets. After leaving this village, our first destination is a scenic pass called Ma Pí Leng. Next, we are taken to a village called Meo Vac. There we meet a local tribe wearing traditional black attire, see traditional homes and pass by Nho Que River. Lastly, we are taken to our hotel, located in the area of Ba Be National Park.



**Day 11:** A Lake Cruise, Caves & Canoeing



Before relocating back to Hanoi, there is much to see and do in and around Ba Be National Park. Highlights include a boat cruise around the lake, Puong Cave, Dau Dang Waterfall, kayaking at Widow's Island and meeting tribal Thai people and seeing rice fields in a village called Cam Ha. Before returning to Hanoi, we explore Hua Ma Cave.



**Day 12:** Floating in the Water & One of Southeast Asia’s Greatest Sunset Locations



We go on a daytrip today to Ha Long Bay. This is Vietnam’s most popular day trip destination…and for good reason. Ha Long Bay is arguably the country’s most naturally gifted area, along with the rice fields of the North. Highlights today include Surprising Cave, swimming and kayaking or bamboo rafting at Titov Island, and watching the sunset (if visiting between April and September).



**Day 13:** Rice Fields, Peddling, Paddling & the Ancient City



We go on another daytrip today. Firstly, we are taken to the ancient capital of Vietnam. It is called Hoa Lu. At this village, we check out the temple. Nearby and next, we go on a guided bike ride. After exploring the countryside, we can eat. After our meal, we are taken to a river called Tam Coc. There we go on a paddle boat ride, led by a local. The highlights are the mountains, the surrounding rice fields and the caves. Upon returning to the dock, we are taken to Mua Cave. The cave itself pales in comparison to the views we get after ascending Lying Dragon Mountain. After hiking to the top, we return to Hanoi.

This evening, we recommend you watch the train pass by a popular coffee shop located at 29A P. Nguyễn Thái Học, Cửa Nam, Ba Đình. After seeing it squeeze between residential buildings, consider walking to Ta Hien Street. This is Hanoi’s most popular street for nightlife.

**Day 14:** Mausoleums, Palaces & More



Below is the list of attractions we will try to see today.

1. Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum

2. Presidential Palace

3. Ho Chi Minh’s Stilt House: This is the former residence of Communist Ho Chi Minh.

4. One Pillar Pagoda

5. Imperial Citadel of Thang Long

6. Vietnam Military History Museum

7. B52 Victory Museum

8. Lotte Observation Deck

Day 15: Our Tour Ends This Morning



Head to the Hanoi airport and fly out.

I travel a lot with my Aeropress GO and Timemore C3. Off lately, I started experimenting with my coffee and cranberry lemon fizzy espresso is something I like a lot. So, I came across this beautiful portable espresso maker and instantly bought it because I am mostly on the move only. Sharing a video of my first few dceent shots here :)

I also got the IMS precision basket, not sure if it's really an upgrade or just a change.

However, this time, somehow it's ended up smelling like coffee. It's light brown in color, slightly the color of brown sugar (much lighter from the dark brown of instant coffee). 
Can any ragi experts tell me if this is ok? Did I just roast the sprouted ragi too much, or left it to sprout for too long? What leads to a coffee smell in ragi powder, is it something to worry about, and how to avoid it from recurring. ",0,1731436674.0,IndianFood,0,0.5,False

I don't think we see Ruby drink anything specific in the show, as far as I remember anyway, although the book - well, my translation, and I don't see why they would change that - does mention what she drinks for breakfast and probably has influenced my headcanon as well.

Mabait in terms of lagi nakasmile, nangangamusta pakiramdam mo if you're feeling okay, nag offer ng food, nag bibigay ng random pasalubongs or snacks, nag aask if we need help like sa work etc.

Nakakaasar ay mga ganitong instances:

\- Masyado matanong ng personal na bagay. Tuwing nag book kami ng paid leave sa work, tatanong nya ano exactly appointment namin. Dito kasi sa Canada, medyo off pag nag ask ka ng personal na ganun lalo if di naman ikaw boss nya. Shookt lang ako kasi bakit parang di pa nya alam yung ganung proper etiquette dito e mas nauna sya sakin makarating sa Canada like 20 years na sya here.

\- May mga tanong sya na parang di nag iisip like nagkasabay kami sa CR after lunch, nakita nya na nag bubrush ako ng ngipin, sabi nya, ""wow, where did you buy that?"" nagtaka pa ko alin?? yung Colgate toothpaste pala. Like huh?? edi sa grocery? Tsaka anong wow dun lol.

Then pregnant kasi ako and soon mag mamaternity leave. Ask nya, ""who's gonna take care of the baby?"" ngek?? edi ako.. kaya nga mag leleave diba?

May time na nagbabalat ako ng apple sa pantry using peeler, ask nya bakit ko daw ginagamit yung peeler sa pagbabalat? -- ano ba dapat gamitin huhu

\- Hindi ko alam if language barrier pero na ooffend ako sa mga comments nya like pumasok ako na masama pakiramdam, maputla, di masyado nag ayos, bungad nya sakin ""What happened to your face??""

\- Also, mga comments nya about me being a filipino, bakit daw maputi ako, slim and matangos ilong... gusto ko sana sabihin e kayo nga magkakamukha eh??

\- Pinaka nainis ako ay yung naghuhugas ako ng lunch box ko tapos nagulat ako bigla nya binuhos yung tirang coffee nya sa sink, nabuhusan yung lunch box/utensils ko na tapos na mawash. Hindi man lang nag excuse me or hinintay ako matapos, nagulat nalang ako nag buhos sya ng cup nya. Aside sa nadumihan ulit mga hinugasan ko e na contaminate pa dahil pinaginuman nya yun. Wala lang sa kanya, normal lang sa kanya, di na ko nakareact kasi agad umalis.

1gprqs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1gprqs1/meetcute/,Meetcute,"Through snow-smoked glass he snags my eye and I become an island, transfixed. The crowd parts around me, tramping home to family, to pets, to HearthWarmd ^^tm apartments, to the soft, forgiving lighting of the holidays, but I'm there, alone, frozen, caught by him.

Again.

—)--

London: December evening, skies flaking down grey, angry, judging, and my own unit is dark, cold, lonely and so he catches my attention. Again. I stop, stand, stare. 

Coat: threadbare, wind-pierced, but I'll be fine. When I walk I'll warm up. I can mind a moment. I've got a coffee.

Him: him.

I let myself daydream, traipsing through the hazy warmth of what-ifs, casting him centerstage as I spool out potential futures. 

—)--

This time it's winter and we sit in my living room, comfortably close, laughing, debating ornament types. “We had this wooden set when I was a kid,” I offer, shyly quiet, and he sits, listening patiently. I blush, continue. “My father bought it, right after they divorced. The twelve days of Christmas.”

 I glance at him and he's smiling, head tilted to one side, waiting for the story's end. My words drop to a mumble. 

“We would sing each verse as we hung each one…” My conclusion dwindles to uncertain silence and then I hear his tenor, barely a whisper, as he gives my hand a squeeze and begins: “On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me…”

I feel the electric flush of being weak, small, ignored and then suddenly noticed. A beautiful ache tickles my skin.

Together for our first Christmas.

—)--

The scene shifts to my dining room now, furniture upscaled and festooned with festive decorations - the theme is wooden, elegant, sparkling. We're richer, happier, healthier, older, a supreme of superlatives. Somewhere offscreen the doorbell rings and then a crowd of guests come in, laughing, hugging, chattering, women I long to befriend now socializing breezily with us.

And their words are genuine, their smiles genuine, their stares genuine - everything, for once, genuine. I can be myself. We've built a family.

I feel a buzzing warmth, guthappy and aspirational, like a slug of wine taking root.

A loving crowd for Christmas.

—)--

We're old, now, him helping me as I totter to the bedroom. My hair is grey, but I'm elegant, poised, dignified, a regal queen, and my world matches: there's a magnificent four poster bed, silk curtains, crown molding, a room from a fairy tale. 

Mine. 

With him.

And he smiles at me, adoring, loving, kind, protective. 

I feel a detached calm, peaceful and resigned - with him at my side, death would be welcome. Another grand adventure to take together.

Never alone for Christmas.

—)--

I shiver, but not from the cold, and square my shoulders, vision focusing as the glass window resolves back into view, and I study him through the frosted pane. Nobody should be alone for Christmas.

I ping my assistant to run some numbers then flush in excitement as the result flashes before me. I can finally swing it. Barely. On a payment plan.

My body is tired, tired of always window-shopping and going home by myself. Nobody should be alone for Christmas. I enter the store and signal to the system that I'm a buyer, indicate his model, pick all the upgrades, bells, whistles. I customize his features, adjust his personality and select immediate delivery.

It’s not cheap, but it's worth it because nobody should be alone for Christmas.

1gprq3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1gprq3g/i_need_your_review_on_the_intricacies_of_a_race/,I need your review on the intricacies of a race tension in my story ,"The main villain for the first book, called 'the Scale Reaver' by local, is a behemoth mutant human who went on a killing spree against the fishmen living in Bobar Island. He had consumed a new recreation drug that is actually a slow burn mutagenic substance that morphs living things into monsters, but as an outlier his mutation is relatively controlled. His mental deterioration lead him to seek out bloody vengeance against the fishmen who had tortured and killed his parents

Fishmen and human share the island of Bobar, though each living in separate towns and villages. Fishmen live in the coast with villages/towns with section of the town both in the water and on the shore, while humans live in the inner island and sometimes on the coast.  However, after Admiral Kepler, the one and only fishmen in the navy, rebelled against the newly crowned Emperessed Analise, there was a huge scouring - a witchhunt by the Empire's military for Kepler's allies and associate across all fishmen settlement of the island. Kepler's hometown was razed to the ground as revenge.

This lead to tension between the human minority of the island and the fishmen. Humans work hard to find work, being discriminated by fishmen from even menial labour jobs. Humans brandishing weapons terrorizing fishmen coffee shops. All this go on and on, eventually leading to a full on race riot. Eventually, humans moved to the nothern part of the island, while fishmen stayed in the south east and south west part. 25 years later (the event of the story) the tension seem to cool down but humans and fishmen of the island rarely if ever contact one another

For some reason or the other (which I haven't thought of yet) the scale reaver's parent's were tortured to near death and gibbeted for people to see. Young Scale Reaver remembered singed this into his memory but could not seek revenge as he know realistically there wasn't anything he could do. He became a dockworker at the largest dock in the island and held silently to that resentment for the rest of his life, until the new drug that came to the island deteriorated his brains and reduced him to a animalistic state which compelled him to act out his pent up hatred against the fishmen. So far, he had completed decimated 2 out of 5 fishmen settlements. The settlements had lost contact, which is why they sent someone to investigate.

My questions are:

1. From what's been said here, is the racial tension between human and fishmen done correctly? Is it a little too melodramatic, ignorant, or hamfisted?

2. Is there anything I could do or sensitive matters I should be aware of when making a plot line about racial rension?

1gprpv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1gprpv8/seeking_insights_on_my_exwifes_behavior/,Seeking insights on my ex-wife's behavior,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some perspective on a complicated situation with my soon-to-be ex-wife, Kate. We've been together since we were both 23, so about 16 years. The past few years have been tough, and I wanted to share some aspects of our relationship to get your thoughts.

Jealousy issues:
Kate was always extremely jealous, often accusing me of cheating, which I never did. She believed I would cheat with anyone, and this constant suspicion led me to alter my behavior around her. I started distancing myself from friends and even gave up activities I enjoyed to avoid triggering her jealousy.

Career changes:
She was unfulfilled in her job and disliked it until we moved to Leipzig, where she rapidly advanced in her career. Ironically, she began working long hours—the very thing she used to criticize me for. This shift seemed to empower her but also created a wider gap between us.

Trust breaches:
I caught her going through my phone multiple times without permission. The last incident led her to move out and start therapy. She claimed the therapy ""healed"" her but never discussed any details with me.

Selfimprovement:
She began immersing herself in self-help books like ""The 48 Laws of Power"" and followed motivational speakers like Tony Robbins. While self-improvement is generally positive, some of these resources seemed to encourage manipulative tactics, which concerned me.

Health concerns:
Kate developed recurrent cystitis, which I treated with antibiotics (I'm in the medical field). One time, the standard treatment didn't work, and after consulting various doctors, she was diagnosed with chlamydia. She was devastated and questioned if I had cheated. I have never been unfaithful; I got tested and was negative. We rationalized it as a possible lab error or sample mix-up at the clinic.

Emotional distance:
Our relationship became strained, with long periods of little to no intimacy—we felt more like housemates. When I tried to express my need for physical and emotional closeness, it often led to fights, which I wanted to avoid. I felt anxious and increasingly unhappy.

Work relationships:
She frequently mentioned how supportive her boss was, noting that others referred to them as ""work spouses."" She spoke highly of him and how much he supported her, which made me feel insecure and anxious—feelings I hadn't experienced before.

Suspicious behavior:
In a moment of insecurity, I checked her browsing history and found searches about how to flirt. This heightened my anxiety about potential infidelity. She also wrote lists of things she liked about me, which felt superficial—like me making her coffee every day.

Couples therapy:
As a last resort, I proposed couples therapy and managed to find a therapist for us. Initially, it seemed to help improve our communication and intimacy. However, after two months, she started distancing herself again, saying it was too much for her. She wanted a break from therapy and promised to organize it herself, which never happened.

Personal notes:
During bouts of anxiety, I read her diary and found hurtful entries. She wrote about enjoying her position at work because she could ""dominate men like her father."" After we broke up, I found notes stating she didn't miss me but missed being desired. She also mentioned needing to be cautious because her boss is a ""bad boy"" who switches from hot to cold.

Inconsistent privacy:
She hid her diary in different places daily, which I always found—it felt like a game of cat and mouse. When I confessed to reading it, she denied knowing I was doing so. After she moved out, she left her computer unlocked without changing the passwords. I couldn't resist looking and found more unsettling notes. I'm puzzled whether this was intentional communication, a form of manipulation, or just carelessness.

Given all this, I'm struggling to understand her behavior and feeling very confused and stuck in rumination.
Ong story short, here are my questions:
1. Do you think her actions indicate narcissistic tendencies?

2. What are your thoughts on the hidden diary and the left-behind, unlocked computer? Could this be intentional manipulation, a way to communicate, or just carelessness?

I appreciate any insights or similar experiences you might share. Thanks for reading",1,1731436294.0,NarcissisticSpouses,7,0.99,False
1gprpty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Loveseat_Recliner/comments/1gprpty/reclining_leather_loveseat/,Reclining Leather Loveseat,"The Benefits of Choosing a Reclining Leather Loveseat for Your Living Space
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right seating for your living space is vital for comfort and style. One option that has gained much popularity is the reclining leather loveseat. This type of furniture blends sophistication with practicality, making it an excellent choice for various homes. Below are some of the key benefits that come with opting for a reclining leather loveseat, and how they can enhance your living area.

### Ultimate Comfort

Comfort is essential in any living space, and a reclining leather loveseat excels in this area. You can sit back and relax while enjoying your favorite TV show or having a chat with friends. The reclining feature allows you to adjust your position easily, giving you the flexibility to find your ideal relaxation angle. Whether you want to sit upright or lie back completely, a reclining loveseat provides you with countless seating options.

### Luxurious Look

Leather furniture has an undeniable elegance that adds a touch of luxury to your home. A reclining leather loveseat can elevate the aesthetics of your living room. Available in various colors, such as classic black, rich brown, or even bold hues, you can choose one that complements your existing decor. Not only does it look sophisticated, but leather also ages beautifully, ensuring that your loveseat will be a timeless piece in your living space.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/reclining-leather-loveseat  
  
### Durability

Investing in a reclining leather loveseat is a smart choice due to its durability. Leather is known for its strength and long-lasting qualities. Unlike fabric sofas that can easily tear or stain, leather can withstand daily wear and tear, making it ideal for households with kids or pets. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning and conditioning, will help preserve its beauty and longevity.

### Easy Maintenance

Maintaining a reclining leather loveseat is straightforward. Unlike fabric furniture that may absorb spills and odors, leather is easier to clean. Most spills can be wiped off quickly with a damp cloth, preventing stains from setting in. You can also use specific leather cleaners and conditioners to keep the material supple and protected. This low-maintenance requirement makes it an appealing option for busy families.

### Versatile Style

A reclining leather loveseat can fit into virtually any style of home decor. Whether you have a modern, traditional, or eclectic theme, these loveseats look fantastic in a variety of settings. You can mix and match with other furniture pieces, such as a stylish coffee table or colorful throw pillows, to create a cohesive living space that reflects your personality.

### Space Optimization

Another advantage of a reclining leather loveseat is that it is an excellent space-saver. Many models are designed to maximize seating while minimizing the footprint in your living area. This is especially beneficial for smaller homes or apartments where space is limited. You can comfortably accommodate guests without overcrowding your space.

### Health Benefits

Beyond comfort, reclining furniture offers several health benefits. A reclining posture can help reduce pressure on your spine, alleviate back pain, and promote better circulation in your legs. If you spend long hours sitting, the reclining feature allows you to shift positions frequently, which is essential for maintaining overall health. By choosing a reclining leather loveseat, you're not only making a comfy choice but also a health-conscious one.

### Investment Value

While a reclining leather loveseat may come with a higher initial price tag than other options, it’s important to recognize its worth. Given its durability and timeless design, a quality leather loveseat can last for a decade or more with proper care. This longevity means you’ll get significant value out of your purchase over time, making it a wise investment for any home.

How to Maintain and Care for Your Reclining Leather Loveseat
------------------------------------------------------------

Your reclining leather loveseat is not just a piece of furniture; it’s a central part of your living space. It offers comfort and style, making it essential to maintain its appearance and functionality. Knowing how to care for your loveseat helps extend its life and keeps it looking great. Here’s how to properly maintain and care for your reclining leather loveseat.

### Understanding Your Leather Loveseat

Leather is a natural material that requires special care. Unlike fabric sofas, leather features a surface that can be damaged by spills, scratches, and heat. Understanding the type of leather can help you know the best maintenance practices. There are several types of leather used in loveseats, including:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/reclining-leather-loveseat  
  
- **Aniline Leather:** This is the most natural type, retaining its texture and breathability but is also the most susceptible to stains.
- **Protected Leather:** This type has a protective coating, making it more resistant to stains and easier to clean.
- **Bonded Leather:** Made from leftovers, it’s more affordable but less durable than genuine leather.

### Regular Cleaning

To maintain the beauty of your loveseat, regular cleaning is necessary. Dust and dirt can accumulate and damage the surface. For routine cleaning, follow these steps:

1. Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the leather weekly.
2. For deeper cleaning, mix a small amount of mild soap with water. Dampen a cloth with the solution and gently wipe the surface.
3. Dry the leather with a separate soft cloth immediately, as excess moisture can lead to damage.

### Stain Removal Techniques

If you accidentally spill something on your reclining leather loveseat, act quickly. Here’s what to do:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/reclining-leather-loveseat  
  
- **For Liquid Stains:** Blot the area with a clean, dry cloth right away. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain.
- **For Greasy Stains:** Sprinkle a small amount of baking soda on the stain and let it sit for a few hours. Wipe it away gently.
- **For Ink Stains:** Use isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab. Dab lightly on the ink, but be careful not to soak it.

### Conditioning Your Leather Loveseat

Conditioning leather is an essential part of maintenance. It keeps the material supple and prevents cracking. Aim to condition your loveseat every 6 to 12 months. Here’s how:

1. Choose a leather conditioner suitable for your type of leather.
2. Apply a small amount to a clean, soft cloth.
3. Gently rub the conditioner into the leather in circular motions, covering the entire surface.
4. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, then buff it with a dry cloth for a nice sheen.

### Protecting Against Damage

Prevention is key! Here are some tips to protect your reclining leather loveseat:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/reclining-leather-loveseat  
  
- **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can fade the leather.
- **Keep Away from Heat Sources:** Avoid placing the loveseat near heaters or radiators to prevent drying.
- **Use Coasters:** Place coasters under drinks to prevent moisture damage.

### Checking for Wear and Tear

Regularly inspect your loveseat for signs of wear or damage. Look for cracks, peeling, or discoloration. Addressing issues early can prevent further damage. If you notice any significant problems, consider seeking professional help for repairs.

### General Tips for Longevity

To ensure your reclining leather loveseat lasts for years, follow these general tips:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/reclining-leather-loveseat  
  
- Utilize furniture covers if you have pets.
- When rearranging furniture, lift the loveseat instead of dragging it.
- Keep sharp objects away from the loveseat to avoid cuts.

By following these maintenance and care tips, you can keep your reclining leather loveseat looking great while ensuring it remains comfortable for you and your guests. If you invest some time and effort into proper care, your loveseat will offer you years of enjoyment.

### Conclusion

A reclining leather loveseat can transform your living space into a cozy retreat. The benefits of choosing such a piece are numerous. It not only adds a touch of elegance with its timeless appeal but also offers unparalleled comfort for you and your guests. Whether you're watching a movie, reading a book, or simply relaxing after a long day, a reclining loveseat provides the perfect spot to unwind. Its ability to enhance your living area’s aesthetic while offering practical functionality makes it a worthy investment for any home.

Maintaining and caring for your reclining leather loveseat is straightforward. Regular cleaning and using the right products will ensure the leather stays supple and looks great for years to come. Simple actions like wiping down surfaces and conditioning the leather periodically can prevent wear and tear and keep it looking new. Remember, treating your loveseat with care not only preserves its appearance but also extends its lifespan, allowing you to enjoy its comfort for many years.

For anonymity, I'll call them Dani and Billie (not their real names).

Billie has struggled with mental health issues for a while, and she’s not always great at reading social cues. Lately, Dani and I have been feeling a bit overwhelmed by her behavior. It started back at Halloween when she described in detail how she and her ex had been planning to have a baby, and then shared some very personal, triggering details about how their relationship ended. It felt like she was trauma dumping. Dani and I even ended up apologizing to some new people we’d just met at the party for the uncomfortable conversation.

At that same party, I’d invited the guy I’m seeing. By the end, it was just the three of us—me, Billie, and him. As a joke, I asked Billie to share what she thought was my biggest “red flag.” Instead, she revealed several of my secrets right in front of him. I was so embarrassed. Another time, we were out for coffee, and I mentioned that this guy had asked me to go to the movies. Billie suddenly started loudly saying that I couldn’t watch a certain movie with him because she was “my girlfriend” and it was “our movie.” Although we sometimes joke about being “girlfriends,” she takes it too far and too often. It honestly makes me uncomfortable.

This past weekend, Billie started acting strangely in our group chat. She said she’d be going offline for a few days and told Dani and me to “take care of ourselves.” Knowing her mental health struggles, we were worried, but in the end, she was fine. It was stressful, though.

Then, Billie mentioned she wanted us to go see a play with her. I told her I’d check my schedule because I was pretty sure I already had plans with other friends. Dani said she was considering booking a doctor’s appointment that day since it was her only free day. So, we didn’t confirm we’d go, but we didn’t outright say no either. This was on Saturday. Then on Monday, Billie told us she’d gone ahead and bought the tickets. But Dani had already scheduled her appointment, and I’d confirmed my plans.

Now, Billie’s asking us to pay her back for the tickets. The problem is, we never actually committed to going, and she knew we might be busy that day. I’d understand paying her back if I’d agreed to go and then had to cancel, but I didn’t say yes in the first place. Honestly, I’m starting to feel uncomfortable hanging out with her, and Dani has told me she feels the same way. I hate conflict, but I don’t think I should have to pay for tickets I didn’t agree to.

ssssssshhh just open a tab in the background, hit the like button, mute or super low volume and if possible make a comment as simple as 7 words. you don't have to interact with all the suffering but you can support its reach to the gods of the algorithm and at the end of the day this is math of viewers=donors. IF POSSIBLE LET THE TAB RUN UNTIL THE VIDEO IS FINISHED. Many people finishing videos=sweet algorithm gold! Just walk out the door after opening the vif if you have to, it doesnt matter! You can even watch other videos at the same time in your current tab YouTube doesn't give a flying flip.

Still watch a few of your faves but help out the other ones you like but dont have time for! I do this with every video from all 3 guys i follow and i watch the ones i can. setting up a youtube tab takes 3 seconds, doesnt affect your mental heallth and eat into your time, AND feeds the algorithm. 

Also yes even 5 dollars helps anyone you support, PayPalling them is the easiest thing in the world, its a mouse click. It's the price of a coffee and if 10% of viewers did this it would be 100 grand a month for people like Brandon and Mac!

Edit: Technically multiple tabs of the video also count as additional views allegedly per the spiffing brit but i wouldnt want to get flagged but one tab never hurt nobody and helps

And a short text excerpt from our favorite author.

There were only three days left before moving to the dormitories of the temple school. There were almost no things to pack, and my father forbade me to take books with me: they could be sold to pay the rent of the house for another week. The same fate awaited my mother's cages, in which she used to keep beautiful songbirds.

""It's good that Giulio came. At least we'll say goodbye normally..."" - I thought, returning to my still-my bedroom with two mugs of cheap, watery coffee.

Giulio - the lanky son of a pharmacist - was my only real friend. With him, you could discuss books, preparation for school, father's problems and all the topics that other boys did not understand or considered nonsense. Giulio was as smart as I was, and that was worth a lot. 
- Here's some coffee. Sorry, we don't have any more normal ones... - I stopped short, freezing on the threshold. 

Giulio was sitting on a neatly made bed, and in front of him on the floor lay a bird. Not my mother's... just some sparrow, I thought with strange detachment, looking at the small pool of blood under the brownish feathers. 
- You killed it? 
- Yes, - Giulio answered calmly. - It flew in from the hallway, and I wanted to tame it. 
- But... why? 
- Why did you want to tame it? It's nice, - he smiled. 

This answer did not shock me. Giulio always trained animals. He had quite a few at home, too. 
- No, - I muttered. - Why did you kill it?
- Oh, you mean that, - Giulio drawled, getting out of bed and carefully wrapping the sparrow's body in a clean handkerchief. - He didn't want to obey. 
- I understand, - I drawled uncertainly.

Perhaps they will help complement your own work, or maybe one of you will find a way to advance them... Thank you anyway for your attention and kindness.*

Hello everyone,

For several years, I have been facing a dilemma that gnaws at me internally. Nothing too serious; I am doing perfectly well, but sometimes my thoughts unwittingly unearth an indescribable feeling: a mix of incompleteness and resignation. I thought long and hard before deciding to make this post out of fear of exposing myself, being misunderstood, or mocked like many people who are too interested in UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena)...

Nevertheless, I feel the need to share a discovery that I believe could prove important. Among you, there will undoubtedly be more skilled and inspired individuals who will know better than I how to make good use of it. I don’t know how you will receive my story; in any case, I sincerely hope that it will capture your attention and kindness.

Here’s how it all began,

Passionate about science since always, I managed to obtain a position as an engineer in a reputable and prestigious company. I was proud of it, even though the scientific aspect was unfortunately drowned in regulations and administration. Years went by... tedious projects were followed by soporific reports to the point that I would swear I had lived the life of a goldfish trapped in its bowl...

Anyway, one day in the summer of 2019, I joined my colleagues at the coffee machine (I know it sounds cliché) to find a semblance of social interaction. That day, the discussion seemed particularly lively. Indeed, my colleagues were commenting on a New York Times article stating that the Pentagon had authenticated a video (FLIR1) of a UAP that had leaked a little earlier.

At that time, I didn’t pay attention to these musings. Being a staunch advocate of critical thinking, I presumed it was a case of misunderstandings, misinformation, or hoaxes, and the story ended there due to a lack of tangible elements. However, this video intrigued me; it showed an object shaped like a Tic Tac, without wings, without propellers, no air intakes, no gas emissions, and yet it managed to keep a distance from an F18 Hornet...

Without saying a word, I watched the video over and over again... questions and speculations were flying from all sides:  
  \- Is it real? A weather balloon?  
  \- Could it be an unknown natural phenomenon? Artificial? Is it a hoax?  
  \- A prototype? How can it fly?  
  \- What navigation instruments does it use? How does it propel itself?  
  \- How does it steer? What was its trajectory?  
  \- What could be its energy source?  
  \- Why does the pilot maintain course while the object is out of sight???

But very quickly, curiosity faded, and discussions returned to trivial matters... except for me... the more I became interested in this case, the more it fascinated me. For my colleagues, it was ultimately just a curious and insignificant anecdote. The fact that this object contradicted years of studies did not seem to affect them in the least. For my part, the feeling was diametrically opposed, and I kept questioning this mystery that had occurred 15 years earlier. Then, due to a lack of time, family obligations, and fatigue, I turned away from it, telling myself that, in any case, other people much more competent, better placed, and experienced had probably already studied the phenomenon from all angles.

Shortly after the lockdown in France, I remember stumbling upon the documentary ""UFOs: A State Affair"" by Dominique FILHOL. I was astonished to see the former director of the DGSE, Alain JUILLET, express his perplexity regarding these phenomena, on which absolutely no information had apparently leaked in nearly 15 years!

This story was becoming increasingly strange. That same night, I revisited the few drafts I had scribbled here and there. I then remembered an idea, a ""trick"" that had germinated in my mind, but at the time it seemed ""too naive"" to be taken seriously. To put it simply:

*^(Think of your aluminum soda can. Consider for a moment those who designed it and the very first question  they must have asked: ""What dimensions offer an optimal volume for minimal aluminum cost?"")*

*^(Without going into details, mathematics allows us to find the precise solution that optimizes both aspects. You just need to set up an equation for volume and surface area based on the same parameters (R radius and x height-to-length ratio). If all goes well, you obtain an equation that can be studied to find an optimum corresponding to the ideal pair R and x.)*

*^(Well... in practice, other parameters come into play (logistics, aesthetics, packaging, coating, varnish, etc.), which significantly distances us from the original solution.)*

*^(Now imagine a future archaeologist who finds the remains of your can. They will be able to measure its dimensions and will perform the reverse reasoning to finally ascertain with certainty the optimization effort. Because there are a vast number of possibilities, but only one is optimized! Logically, they will conclude that this object was designed and produced by ingenious people.)*

And you see where this reasoning leads us: If the object is artificial, it is certain that its designers would have used their knowledge to maximize advantages while minimizing constraints—in a word: optimize. I emphasize that this is about searching for ""the trace of an optimization"" to confirm or refute the artificiality of the phenomenon. This approach does not claim to explain its technique or even less its origin. Assuming it is a hoax or a misunderstanding, there is very little chance of finding the trace of a ""fortuitous optimization.""

So I start by formulating the volumes and surfaces of each part of the Tic Tac. I compare them all in the same table. Once my work is finished, I find that nothing particular stands out, just convoluted formulas containing x and R but nothing truly conclusive. The premises of my reasoning thus lead to a dead end and a manifest absence of optimization of the fuselage. ""What a waste of time... and to think I missed an episode of The IT Crowd for this!"" Science has spoken... this approach yields absolutely no results.

... unless...

What if we introduced a value for one of the two parameters? We cannot give an accurate estimate of the radius, but we can provide an approximate estimate of x by taking the height-to-length ratio from the video. I measure and find about 0.4. I then revisit the table, replacing x with this value.

... and there, everything changes...

I remember feeling dizzy; I was astonished! ... I went over and over all the calculations... no mistakes. There was indeed a particular relationship appearing for the precise value of x = 0,4. Until now, my approach was purely motivated by scientific curiosity and a critical approach... I didn’t genuinely expect a robust result... But suddenly, without even realizing it, I found myself facing a result I could not ignore: ""The phenomenon is undeniably the result of a judicious design."" If, like me, this result intrigues you, you may not be ready for what comes next...

Remember, to optimize, you need a starting equation; well, this starting equation of the Tic Tac can be found, and here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/hs9tgkj1gi0e1.png?width=343&format=png&auto=webp&s=0846c3d24699d51c37d5a6fa7e70f1a70c2142d9

In concrete terms, it highlights a relationship between spherical and cylindrical surfaces and their respective volumes. This relationship disappears for any value of x other than 0,4. All calculations and demonstrations are, of course, available in the last part of this message so that everyone can access them freely and revisit them at leisure.

Has anyone noticed this before? To my knowledge, no; I was the only one to have discovered this result or at least the only one willing to talk about it and make it known. Later, I would learn that an article discussing the shape of bacteria also revealed a relationship between volume and surface, but ultimately nothing comparable. Other than that, nothing!

Well... Okay, I found this... it's interesting or at least quite curious... and now? ... What do I do? ... Who do I talk to now, if possible without coming off as crazy?

I’ll spare you my tribulations, but fortunately, SIGMA2 in France offered me the chance to present my work, which I was more than delighted and relieved about. The presentation went wonderfully; very competent and qualified people made constructive observations and critiques with varying degrees of reservations about the conclusions. Everyone agreed that the approach had a certain interest, and my caution was particularly appreciated.

The commission took good notes on my work but raised a significant problem that I had not anticipated: No radar recording = no investigation; it’s as simple as that, and it’s perfectly understandable. The catch is that the SCU is trying to obtain these recordings without success so far.

Since then, what has become of my work?

Well... to be honest... not much 😅...

I continued to study the previous results and made some additional advances (much more delicate to explain). Nevertheless, in terms of communication, it’s a void... Unfortunately, I have not managed to make them known much more. Yet, I regularly see journalists and others discussing this case, making all sorts of hypotheses but never mentioning this relationship... thinking about it, I feel like I’m living a 2.0 version of the Cassandra myth. And now, I dread seeing it gradually sink into oblivion when it seems to me to be an essential piece of the puzzle.

There you go; now you know everything there is to know in broad strokes. At least if you had the courage (or the madness) to read this scandalously long post! 😅

I look forward to reading your feedback. Thank you.

As promised, the demonstrations, reasoning, and calculations are all available below:

Let’s start by schematizing our Tic Tac:

https://preview.redd.it/uyc585g8gi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=51071f5d971c16e0e8a59daebe73daa8c28cae2d

The first step is to establish the formulas for the surfaces and volumes of each ""spherical"" or curved ""part."" It quickly becomes clear that 2 parameters (x: height-to-width ratio and R: radius) are sufficient to define the shape.

https://preview.redd.it/zxgphzdcgi0e1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=07485a381a289a851aac238ca35364b379c9ecb8

The second consists of comparing them in a first table (with x and R undetermined). Nothing conclusive appears for the moment.

https://preview.redd.it/vgiex0rdgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cfabb907d0d9214da9fdfd874cbcba67c85d00

If we refer to the video, we can see that x is around 0,4.

https://preview.redd.it/nuz691efgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b438cfc8ce2a4e3960f39afe40633ebb28fadf

Let's take our previous table again with x = 0,4 ; this time, everything changes :

https://preview.redd.it/2ac5981hgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf8c544ad81a2d0a241c892df8541d983d3f52a2

For the sake of verification, let’s revisit the problem as a hypothetical designer would have approached it. That is to say, starting from a constraint formulated in an equation to arrive at the most advantageous solution for x:

https://preview.redd.it/jxt43chkgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4de010bd961dbd384d214104eef8aa9157e9d4b

The hypothesis of an optimization is greatly supported, but can it still be a coincidence?

Let us now express compactness:

**In retrospect, I have a reservation about the use of compactness (C=1); it indeed allows for an estimation of R that aligns with the pilots' observations, but at the cost of 'heavy' implications that I will not elaborate on here.**

https://preview.redd.it/jb3nd09mgi0e1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5b2add798c276922ad5b6f23d98d8e75bc2e21

We can now complete our diagram with the optimal solutions:

https://preview.redd.it/ehjpbmsygi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=51989d9844c00ae8f92e90fedbc56ec7c7801c7b

We arrive at a 'predictive' length of approximatelyb 11,5m. As a reminder, the witness pilots estimated the length of the TIC TAC to be about 12m (40 ft).

Our little trick thus leads us to an optimal solution that is extremely close to the witnesses' estimates, which supports a 'wise' design. The highlighted relationship has undoubtedly served as the basis for this design.

The following diagram summarizes the pathways:

The story doesn't stop there, but the continuation becomes much more mathematical. However, this post is probably already far too long! But at least I now feel the relief and satisfaction of having shared and given these calculations a chance to live their own life.

I was already on high protein low carb low sugar diets and my weight didnt budge, but i was also going to the gym and weight training which ive done on and off theoughout my late 20s. Im going to be 28 soon.

How many grams of sugar are you all taking in? How often are you avoiding added sugar? What about carbs like rice and bread? Trying to go GF and even make my own bread at home but haven’t had the bandwidth. I work a really demanding job with varying hours dependent on deadlines and projects. 

I’ve had a bad relationship with food my entire life so I have really been trying here. The only time I lost a substantial amount of weight was during Covid because i was restricting to 900-1200 calories and walking around a mile or some form of exercise every single day. Different job, different life altogether.

I see other posts of people who are saying they see others who have like starbucks coffee and sweets and fries and whatnot and look great still. I have the PCOS gut and have drastically changed my eating, on metformin, I’ve stopped skipping meals and now have three a day. For example yesterday:

-breakfast: 1/2 cup bear naked granola and 1 cup oatmilk as a cereal. Cup of coffee with oatmilk and oatmilk based creamer. Some days i have two cups, or one cup coffee and one cup of iced chai made with Tazo skinny chai and Oatly oatmilk. I use reduced fat oatmilk.

-lunch: sandwich on multigrain bread (not gluten free) with 4-5 pieces of turkey, 1 slide provolone, some lettuce and mustard with ground black pepper

-Snacks: i grab a handful of homemade trail mix every so often (mixed salted nuts, i believe its Lily’s dark chocolate chips and organic died cranberries). Sometimes if i want something more sweet i grab a low sugar coconut chocolate thing called “Unreal”, theyre basically an alternative to Mounds (70 calories per mini, 3g added sugar, 5g trans fats). I may grab one or two of those and a mini child size bag of Albanese gummy bears (45 calories per bag with maybe 6g added sugar no fat). I may have a couple of both of these throughout the day. I also have recently been snacking on 100calorie cups of pomegranate seeds and have done greek yogurt and berries with honey and absolutely hate that.

-Dinner: Airfried salmon with salt and pepper, air fried brussel sprout shavings with minimal extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and a cup of minute rice with a very minimal amount of butter (sometimes butter, most of the time i dont add butter).
