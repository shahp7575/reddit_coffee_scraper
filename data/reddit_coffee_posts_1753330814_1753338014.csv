1m7wsul,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanleandro/comments/1m7wsul/sprouts_and_philz_coffee_updates/,Sprouts and Philz Coffee Updates,"Hey SL fam! I know this has been asked a few times already, but figured it’s worth another shot since there’s still no confirmed opening date floating around.

There’s been a lot of chatter about the Philz and Sprouts going in at the Callan complex (fridge installs, signs of progress, etc.), but updates are still few and far between… so I wanted to ask more directly:

Does anyone here actually work at either of these spots, will be working there, know the franchise owners, or have any insight from the city?

Even a rough timeline would be hugely appreciated. Are we talking weeks? Months? End of the year? Any known hangups..or are things still on track?

As someone who’s super active in the San Leandro community, I think I speak for a lot of us when I say: we’re hyped. Like, ready-to-rally-behind-opening-day hyped. If we had even a general idea of when the doors were opening, you’d def feel the support

Totally understand that dates can shift and not everyone’s allowed to share exact info- but if you’ve got any insight at all, love to hear it

1m7ws9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1m7ws9l/dutch_bros_abandoned_the_kldr_secret_sound_segment/,Dutch Bros abandoned the KLDR ‘Secret Sound’ segment,"I live in Grants Pass, Oregon where Dutch Bros first started. I’ve noticed a trend over the past few years, as I’m sure some of you have also, that Dutch Bros is losing the connection with their community that made them so great. 

The timing may be coincidental, and their new CEO plays a part as well, but I noticed the trend shortly after Travis Boersma’s venture of building The Flying Lark “race-cino” adjacent to his horseracing track was shut down by the state of Oregon. This was after millions were spent on constructing the site, which was foolish without the proper permitting in place, and resulted in the building never opening and eventually being sold to a church. I believe this planted the seed for him that he would get his revenge and slowly remove his corporate headquarters and furthermore his financial support to the community of Grants Pass and the state of Oregon as a whole. 

Many other things have happened along the way, most notably the staggered shutdown of their local corporate headquarters and subsequent relocation to Arizona. (Admittedly, the building was donated and will be re-purposed as a children’s museum)

However most recently, and what inspired me to make this post/rant, they stopped sponsoring a local radio segment that they have been apart of for 20+ years. The local radio station, KLDR, has consistently had a daily segment Monday through Friday called “The Dutch Bros Secret Sound” where a sound clip was played and the first caller to identify the sound would get a $20 gift card to Dutch Bros. It was a fun tradition in Grants Pass and was a boon to the local radio station, got DB essentially free advertising and community goodwill. It was so cute hearing parents calling in with their kids on the way to school, or hearing office workers gathered around cheering on their coworker who finally was able to ring through the busy signals and give the correct answer. It was a vibe and I’ve loved playing it with coworkers at every job I’ve worked. 

They used to play the game twice per day, once at 7:50am and again at 4:35pm. Then, last year, it changed to once a day, being played only in the morning at 8:20am. Now, as of 2 weeks ago, they have abandoned their sponsorship of the segment altogether and the “Secret Sound” is now sponsored by a different chain of eateries in Grants Pass (Casablanca Coffee and Grill). 

This may seem insignificant to some, but it really is the final nail in the coffin for me when it comes to Dutch Bros. Abandoning such a longstanding tradition in their hometown, which has supported them since the beginning, is truly distasteful. The expense for the segment ($200/week) is what amounts to a rounding error for a multi-billion dollar company, and it really seems like yet another step towards complete divestment in Grants Pass, seemingly in my opinion purely as retribution for The Flying Lark incident. 

Anyone else from GP feel the same way? ",1,1753337896.0,dutchbros,0,1.0,False

[Mr. Scary]

I considered myself to have sufficiently played the 'wingman' role for my ...I didn't really *know* what to call Ghartok. We'd fought against each other, fought alongside each other, saved each others' lives multiple times, and gotten each other laid even more times, so I guess ""it's complicated"" would be the best description, and I mounted the stairs with two mugs of coffee in my hands.

If Butcher Ghartok made good on his offer to that feline waitress (I'd like to call her a ""catgirl"", but that is considered a bit of a slur some places in the galaxy, so I try to not use it), who was literally *built* to take what he was packing, then I'd helped him score again.

I was a bit interested to see if he goes through with it. Not see it directly - I'm not a voyeur - but just hear whether or not they really ended up going for it. Unless he'd been screwing his students, it had probably been a while since he got any. He wasn't wrong about feline penises being an enormous turnoff for females of most species. The barbs aren't exactly a selling point - except for other felines.

But given the ears and tail on that waitress, he might have gotten lucky. Or exceptionally unlucky, I thought while walking down the hallway, remembering that those rippers on his cock were meant to *induce ovulation in feline females*. If he did score with her, it would be an absolute endzone play that made him a father. Maybe that would be ok? Butcher Ghartok had already become a High Professor at an extremely reputable galactic university, so maybe settling down and having a family was what he needed right now?

Or maybe she was on the pill, or whatever version had been formulated for her species. She *was* working in a whorehouse, even if it was also a bar and a bit of a restaurant. That was all Ghartok's problem, not mine. I had other problems.

Arriving at the room where we'd spent the night, I could see his student, ""The White Rabbit"", had *definitely* gotten lucky with The Madam, although the way she was embracing him and covering him with her tails seemed almost more ...motherly? Than anything else. Not my circus, not my monkeys. I suppose I could have felt a bit jealous, but a kid with huge potential in him (if he was 'The White Rabbit' and an *ace* at his age, he was going places) was a much better choice than I was - a graying old mercenary. I still felt a twinge, but-

Then I almost slapped myself, and would have if I hadn't been carrying two mugs of coffee. She was The Madam. She was, to put it bluntly, a whore. A high-class one and a hell of a good fuck, but getting jealous over a whore screwing someone else? What kind of moron would do that? Honestly, I'd even *prefer* it if she managed to form a stable relationship with 'bunnyboy'/'The White Rabbit'/Leporidae she was embracing.

Who I *did* need to deal with was Dr. Jane Morrison. She'd told me her first name last night, and here I was to offer her coffee.

""Mmmmh?"" she asked as I awoke her. Then she saw the coffee.

""Brought you something I figured you'd want,"" I said, ""as a bit of an installment on my apology for yesterday.""

""You're going to have to make *plenty* more installments on that plan!"" she tossed back in my face, ""but I'll take the coffee, and,"" she said, ""is there somewhere to drink it here that at least has a view of the skyline?""

""I'll check,"" I said.

I did actually manage to find a balcony via the staff (who were in dead fear of me) where we could sip coffee together in comfort. By the time I'd returned, Dr. Morrison was dressed, and I told her where to go.

""You know,"" she told me, holding one mug as she kept pace, ""that was the *perfect* amount of time for this to go from steaming to drinkable!""

...I will never understand women. She sat in the chair next to me on the balcony and started sipping her mug of coffee as I sipped mine.

""I'm glad you liked the delay,"" I said, feeling like an idiot schoolboy instead of a mercenary who'd earned his gray and white hairs under the C-Beams.

""Timing is important in a man,"" Dr. Jane Morrison said, ""and please just call me 'Jane'. 'Dr. Morrison' is too formal for our...""

She let that hang in the air, either considering how to finish it, or waiting for me to finish it for her.

""Relationship?"" I asked.

And I was rewarded with a coffee-flavored kiss.",1,1753337809.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best tray candles in 2025 prioritize several essential features, ensuring a premium experience for the user.

**Tray Material and Design:**

The tray material is paramount, significantly impacting the overall aesthetic and durability of the candle arrangement. Many high-end tray candles feature trays crafted from materials like polished metal (stainless steel, gold-toned), natural stone (marble, slate), or durable wood (acacia, bamboo). The design often incorporates clean lines, minimalist aesthetics, or intricate patterns to complement diverse interior styles. The tray's edges are typically designed to contain any wax spills, adding a layer of practicality to the decorative element.

**Wax Type and Fragrance Quality:**

The type of wax used in the candles directly affects the burn quality, fragrance throw, and overall longevity. Soy wax has become increasingly popular due to its clean burn, eco-friendliness, and ability to hold a higher fragrance concentration. Beeswax is another premium option known for its natural aroma and extended burn time.Paraffin wax, while more affordable, is often blended with other waxes to mitigate its potential for sooty emissions. The quality of the fragrance is crucial.Premium tray candles use essential oils or carefully crafted fragrance blends that offer complex and long-lasting scents without being overly overpowering.

**Number and Size of Candles:**

The number and size of candles included in a tray candle set influence both the visual impact and the overall burn time.

Larger candles provide a longer burn time and stronger fragrance diffusion, while smaller candles offer a more subtle and delicate glow. The dimensions of the candles are carefully considered to ensure a balanced and visually appealing arrangement on the tray.

**Safety Features and Burn Time:**

Safety is a vital consideration in the design of tray candles. High-quality sets include stable trays that prevent tipping and heat-resistant materials to protect surfaces underneath. The burn time of each candle is a key indicator of its value. Premium candles can offer burn times ranging from 20 hours for smaller votives to over 100 hours for larger pillar candles, depending on the wax type and size. Proper wicking is essential to ensure a clean and even burn, minimizing the risk of tunneling or excessive smoking.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Design Cohesion:**

The overall aesthetic appeal of a tray candle set is critical for its role as a decorative element. The design should be cohesive, with the tray, candles, and any additional decorative elements (such as stones or crystals) complementing each other harmoniously.

Attention to detail, such as the finish of the tray and the shape of the candles, contributes significantly to the overall visual impact.## Core benefits

Me (30F) and my husband (34M) have been going through lots of imbalance last year, until it hit the point where we were fighting all the time and couldn't stand each other. 
We didn't hug, kiss, talk, or sometimes even sleep in the same bed. 
I didn't feel loved at all, and I felt like our marriage is going to end.
I kept trying, making his favorite meals, being a house wife, cleaning the house, on top of working full time. But nothing was good enough.
He decided that he's gonna go on a guys only trip with his buddy and then we can talk about our future.
I was working 13 hour shifts and I met someone at work, that gave me all the attention I craved so much. 
When my husband came home, we talked and he decided he needed more time alone, so he left to go to his friends place 9 hours away for few weeks.
In the meantime, I discovered I had some feelings for this person from work, that gave me all attention and compliments all the time. So couple weeks into my husband being gone, I told him that I met someone who lifts my spirits. 
His reaction was of course bad, he was very hurt and felt betrayed, which I understand. 
Few days later, he texted me asking if I'd be okay if he gave his number to this girl he met at the library, and landed her his book. He specified he is asking me out of respect to me and love he holds for me. I voiced that it'd probably make me feel uncomfortable, but he can if he felt like he wanted to. His response was ""I didn't do it, because I'm faithful and love only you, I wouldn't do that to you"". 
Long story short, I removed the other person out of my life and started working on my marriage to strengthen my relationship with my lovely husband.
Three months after we both decided we will work on our relationship and focus on us, I found out that the ABSOLUTELY gave her his number and they've been texting and flirting around. He even went to see her for a coffee in our city.
I came out to him that I was hurt, but he swept it off with ""You hurt me, I did nothing to compare to that"" and doesn't thing he did anything wrong.

Your early retirement was as peaceful as it could be in this hectic city. All until *someone* decided to stake out your usual cafe to talk.,"“Hm?” What an ugly kid. Vila thought, taking a small sip of her double shot of espresso as the child neared her table, placing its crayon-smudged fingers near her plate. She sat her drink down, creating a small clank on the plate, hoping to startle the boy away. When he stayed, she exhaled, wondering what he could even want from her.

She glanced at her plate, seeing the free sugar biscuit they had given her with her drink. One Vila had no interest in eating. The boy went to snatch it, only for Vila to reach it first, holding it between two fingers. “Is this what you’re gawking at?” She asked, rotating the biscuit between her fingers.

The boy’s mouth widened when the biscuit moved, and Vila contemplated throwing it into his mouth, as if he were a caged tiger, and she was a nervous zookeeper that didn’t want to risk feeding him by hand. Instead, she set the biscuit down, smiling. “You can have it.”

The boy smiled, dimples digging into his dirt-covered cheeks as he grabbed the biscuit, crushing it in his grip before pouring the tiny pieces into his mouth. “Thak.” He said in an attempt at a thank you before running off to his parents, who hadn’t been paying attention to him.

She watched where the kid ran off to, only for her attention to get pulled back to her table when a chair scrapped across the tiled floor. She always chose a table with only one seat to avoid situations like this happening, but it seems Lightflight planned to invite himself to her table, regardless.

“Sorry, the table’s full.” Vila said, giving a polite smile. It was hard to act like she didn’t know who he was, given the pair had foiled each other’s plans at least fifty times over the course of her career. She even fondly remembered snapping his pinky finger while he was unconscious once, just to screw with him. A ‘joke’ he hadn’t found funny.

“Vila.” The blonde-haired hero the peak definition of what a hero was. Powerful body, muscles, long beach blonde hair, and a winning smile. She could see why the ladies loved him, even if she found him to be the most unappealing man alive. To her, he reeked of a generic good guy, and now he had seated himself at her table.

“It’s Helen. Are you mistaking me for someone?” She pushed up her short brown hair, having dyed it that color to avoid the constant questions about her identity. It’s funny. She and the other villains always used to make fun of the concept of superhero disguises in movies. How could you possibly not recognize someone just because they’re wearing glasses? But now she kind of got it. People weren’t that observant, especially not the average person, who worried more about paying their bills than identifying villains on the street.

Lightflight sat across from her without a coffee or even a biscuit in his hand, making Vila roll her eyes. Heroes were always so sloppy with these sorts of things. When she used to threaten people in public, she would always do it with a smile on her face. Approaching them with coffee, popcorn, or a drink, depending on where she met them. She would act as if they were best friends, anything to blend in and not cause any suspicion.

“No, I’m not mistaking you for someone else.” He scowled.

“How do you think this looks, Lightflight? A man approaching a woman who clearly doesn’t want him near her, and forcing her into a conversation? I could turn this into a scene if I wished.” Vila said, not even as a threat, more to point out the stupidity of his plan.

“I’m not Lightflight. Today I’m Jake.”

“I’m not calling you Jake. Perhaps when you retire, I’ll consider it. Though I hope we never see each other again after this.”

“Your retirements exactly why I’m here.” Lightflight leaned across the table, and Vila didn’t budge from her seat. She knew him too well. Knew he didn’t fit the bad cop role, he was too clean for that.

“Relax. You’re not the type to threaten people, so why don’t you get comfortable? I’m guessing you’re doubting the validity of my retirement.”

Lightflight stared at his hands, seeing them grasping the sides of the table. She was right. This wasn’t him at all. He allowed his body to lean back into his seat, folding his arms over his chest. “Exactly. What, I’m supposed to believe after all these years of fighting, you’re getting out of the villain game? What are you planning? It’s been a year now, and you haven’t acted. If it’s something big, I want to remind you that innocent people could get hurt by whatever you’re scheming.”

“Oh, please. I rarely hurt innocent people. Hm, actually I sometimes hurt innocent people, but most of them are heroes, so they hardly count. How’s your pinky, by the way?”

“Not as straight as it once was.” He snarled, his reaction to the question making Vila laugh.

“Can I see it?”

The hero held up his left hand, and as stated, the pinky now sat at an angle, never having correctly settled back into its usual position. After letting her look, he sat his hand back in his lap. “Alright, now that I’ve satisfied your curiosity, answer my question. What are you planning?”

“To stay retired. I’m tired, Lightflight. I’m thirty-eight years old. I’ve been doing this villainous stuff since I was sixteen. My hands aren’t as good as they once were, and my sights failing me.” She said, tapping the side of her glasses. “Thirty five plus is when most villains die. There are too many young heroes and villains in the game now. I’m past my prime. You would be getting close to yours too, right?”

“I’m forty.” Lightflight stated, and for once, Vila was speechless. She glanced him over again, in disbelief over his age. The muscles, the long hair, he looked thirty, not forty.

“Good for you.” She said with a hint of jealousy, tapping her fingers against her other hand, trying to hurry the conversation along.

Lightflight slyly smiled. He knew that someday she would find out he was actually thirty and that was a cheeky lie, but until that day came, his age would be a slight annoyance in the back of her mind. “So, that’s really it? No, last ride? No big scheme?”

“None. I saw an opportunity to quietly leave that life behind, and I took it. Shouldn’t you be applauding me, hero? I became a good… Well, not exactly a good person, but I’ve become a functioning member of society.”

“So you have.” Lightflight scratched his chin before standing. “I guess that’s all I needed to know then. I’m sorry for bothering you.” He turned to leave, only to stop, lowering his head, feeling he had to say something before he went. “I enjoyed our fights.” He mumbled, not looking back at her.

“I did too. Now, either congratulate me for turning my life around or leave.”

Lightflight nodded, going to the counter before he left. Vila raised an eyebrow, finding it odd he left the counter without a drink. She went to leave a few minutes after Lightforce, only for a group of workers to suddenly surround her table. The former villain flinched, eyes darting around the room. Was this a trick? Was she being captured for her former crimes? Had he set her up? She got ready to ignite her palms, only for the workers to start clapping.

I'm a 32 year old from Mexico (also with EU passport these days) that will be heading to Ukraine after Poland for a couple of weeks. I've had a strong connection with the country for years (lived in Pryluky for work for a couple of weeks, have friends and a Ukrainian ex gf) and I had already booked a long term trip to Lviv, Kyiv and Odesa back in the day which was cancelled as covid had just started.

Now I've got some time between jobs and really want to make my way there, would be great to explore the culture, connect with people and if possible and useful (cause I know it's not always the case) help out volunteering somehow.

I'm catching a train from Krakow to Lviv in early August (5th - 10th) and originally planned on spending a week there and any surrounding areas but would appreciate any local tips, suggestions and pointers. The idea as of now is heading to Kyiv after  (10th - 17th) and then do the same route back

Thanks for any ideas and suggestions and if anyone would like to grab a coffee or beer while I'm there that'd be also great!

As a last question what's the best way to move between cities? I've been looking at trains between Lviv and Kyiv and seem to have some available via Ukrainian Railways app but nothing back.

BlaBlaCar seems to show buses with Ecolines, but not sure what works best.

Any advice on what to do, where to go and the length of the trip would be massively appreciated as everything is extremely flexible, I just aim at bein in Warsaw by August 20th (for not departures booked from Lviv).",3,1753337066.0,Kyiv,0,1.0,False

Lately it feels like everything’s on overdrive. The days blur together. There’s always something happening — in the world, online, at work, in your head — and it never stops. It’s like we all quietly agreed to live at this insane pace, and now we don’t know how to slow down without feeling like we’re falling behind.

I wake up and my brain already feels behind. News is hitting before I’ve even had coffee. Everyone’s reacting to ten different things by 9am. It’s like our minds were never meant to take in this much, this fast. And I feel it — mentally, physically, all of it.

Work doesn’t help. It’s not even work-life balance anymore — it’s more like work-life bleed. Emails at night. Slack messages while you’re cooking dinner. Always being “on” or available. And sure, we tell ourselves it’s flexible, but honestly? It’s exhausting. There’s no off switch anymore.

Social media just adds to the pressure. Even though I know it’s curated, it still gets in my head. Everyone looks like they’re doing amazing — new jobs, new houses, perfect vacations, side hustles, gym routines. Meanwhile, I’m just trying to make it through the week without spiraling. It’s hard not to compare, even when you know better.

And tech… man, I can’t keep up. New platforms, apps, AI stuff — it never ends. Some days it feels exciting, other days I’m like, “Do I really need to learn one more thing just to not fall behind?” I’m not even that old, but it’s already starting to feel like the world’s evolving faster than I can adapt.

And then there’s just… everything else. The world’s heavy right now. Global disasters, climate stuff, wars, political chaos. All of it’s in our face 24/7. It’s hard to care about your to-do list when you’re constantly reminded how fragile everything is.

Anyway. I’m not trying to make some big dramatic statement. I just needed to get this off my chest. If anyone else feels like they’re constantly playing catch-up in a world that won’t slow down — you’re not alone.

Have You Noticed Something Similar?,"She worked at a design studio in Baner, Pune — long hours, tight deadlines, and her hands were her life. But slowly, without warning, things started slipping — quite literally. She couldn't hold her tools properly, her fingers would go numb, and simple tasks like opening a bottle or typing out an email became exhausting.

At first, she blamed the stress. Then the posture. A couple of physiotherapy sessions, some wrist braces, and advice from friends — none of it helped. The pain would shoot up her forearm at night. Some mornings, she woke up unable to move her fingers at all.

She stopped going out. Skipped work. And deep down, she feared the worst — that this was permanent. That she’d have to give up the career she built from scratch.

A colleague mentioned seeing a *hand surgeon in Pune* who helped someone else recover from similar symptoms. Tired, scared, and nearly out of hope, she booked an appointment with [Dr. Chaitanya Karande](https://g.co/kgs/EDeKUjS).

He listened — really listened. For the first time, she felt understood. A few scans, a clear diagnosis, and a plan that didn’t involve guesswork.

But I still see your smile when I close my eyes.
I trace the stars and whisper your name,
Yet every night, it feels just the same.

I miss your voice, your laugh, your touch,
It’s wild how someone can mean so much.
They say time heals, or so I’ve heard,
But missing you? That’s a whole other world.

My heart still leaps at every text you send,
Each call from you feels like the wind
That stirs my soul and calms the ache—
Oh, the joy just your voice can make.

This bed feels strange without you near,
I lie awake and wish you were here.
I hug a pillow and close my eyes,
Pretending it’s you, just for the night.

I daydream of coffee and lazy days,
Of tangled limbs and your silly ways.
Of your forehead kisses, soft and sweet,
And how my world feels so complete.

Some say distance makes love grow strong,
But I just know I’ve loved you all along.
And though these days feel long and blue,
Every second brings me closer to you.

So until I’m back in your embrace,
I’ll hold you close in every space—
Of every heartbeat, every sigh,
My love for you will never die.

You’re my person, my peace, my home—
Even if right now, I sleep alone.
But I’ll wait, I’ll hope, I’ll count the days,
Until we meet again, and I can stay.

Hope this is okay to post, unsure where else I could, but bit of background I am a 27m and a schizophrenic, I just had a dream about toy story (haven't seen the film since I was a child) and if anyone (when the IP runs out for those films) wants to direct a horror movie about it please just ask 🤣.

I woke up over an hour ago and have been scribbling every part of it down since, my coffee went cold as it took a while but its now 6.50 am and its safe to say although I went to bed at 1 and very much love sleeping I wont be going back to bed due to this dream and although I have refused help I the past (I feel like they condescend me) i am going to reach out and discuss some of my trauma today with a specialist as I want to sleep and I currently dont see a future in which that is possible without at least talking about why my trauma led to this happy childhood film being conjoined with pure horror inside my brain...

I am sure if anyone wanted to write or direct this dream as a short film or an actual full length suspense esque horror that they would need a huge disclaimer as anyone invested in Disney like the people who love it probably couldn't watch it in the way it would be (portrayed as Andys life instead of my own) without taking their own life...

I'm going to grab a second blanket and make a new coffee that's actually hot and get in contact with a specialist to try minimise the future damage this dream will have on me by talking about my life events that were andys flashbacks in the dream.

But its all written down and yes if anyone wants to make every Disney fan cry one day id be happy to discuss it fully with detail around my writing points after I have spoken to a specialist and am not feeling violently sick at my own brain.

1m7wgcw,https://github.com/singhJasvinder101/leetpush,I added a LeetCode Premium feature (free Time/Space Complexity) to my extension that syncs your solutions to GitHub.,"Hey everyone,

**TL;DR: I built a free Chrome extension called** [**leetpush**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetpush/fppdnbfkhpmppifbmmchnhpnmmickbin) **that automatically saves your LeetCode solutions to GitHub. The new update adds a free Time & Space Complexity Analyzer (like LeetCode Premium) and coding memes for fun.**

Like many of you, I'm constantly on **LeetCode** preparing for interviews. I got really tired of two things: manually copying my code to create a **GitHub portfolio** and not knowing my code's efficiency without paying for Premium.

So, I built a tool to fix it. It's called **leetpush**.

**What does it do?**

* **Automatic LeetCode to GitHub Sync:** Solved a problem? Bam. It's instantly committed to your GitHub repo. It's the easiest **LeetCode GitHub integration** you'll find.
* **\[NEW\] Free Complexity Analyzer:** This is the big one. After you solve a problem, the extension shows you the **Time and Space Complexity** (Big O notation). This is a game-changer for interview prep and something you normally have to pay for. It’s the perfect **LeetCode Premium alternative** for performance analysis.
* **\[NEW\] Coding Memes:** After a successful submission, it shows you a relevant meme. Because why not have a little fun while you grind?

I’m committed to keeping this tool 100% free and open-source. My goal is to help students and developers **save their LeetCode solutions** and learn more effectively.

Since this is a passion project, I’m not putting up a paywall. Instead, if you find the tool genuinely useful for building your **coding portfolio** or for the **free complexity analysis**, I've set up a ""Buy Me a Coffee"" page.

Any support would be incredible and will help me cover server costs and keep developing new features.

**Links:**

* **Install on Chrome:** [leetpush on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetpush/fppdnbfkhpmppifbmmchnhpnmmickbin)
* **Source Code & Details:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/singhJasvinder101/leetpush)

I'd love to hear your feedback. What do you think? Any features you'd like to see in the next **LeetCode automation** update?

To counter any ""*Why did you spend so much time in Tashkent...*"" - I prefer working from cities, preferably in coworking spaces.

I don't like moving about during the work week, and having visited Samarkand I feel thoroughly vindicated that I didn't spend any longer working from there. 

I had originally only booked two weeks in Tashkent but having enjoyed my time in Almaty and Bishkek so much, I extended it for another two weeks prior to arriving. Having worked from 50+ places in the last few years with close to no regrets, doing a full month would unfortunately be one of them.

With that being said, I actually had a very comfortable and productive period, but for anyone on a time-restricted schedule, it's just not somewhere you want to prioritise for a riveting stay.

**How would I suggest structuring a trip to Tashkent?**

I would book in for two weeks and use that middle weekend with a holiday day either side to see Bukhara, Samarkand and anywhere else on the high-speed train line that takes your fancy. Whatever you want to see in Tashkent you'll easily fit in and if for whatever reason you do miss something in the city, I doubt you'll be heading to the airport with too many regrets.

# Things I loved 

**An evening run along the canal**

If you get dropped off by Yandex at the [Minor Mosque](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bZZajqH2LNnKunY1A), there's an ideal approximately 5km running route down to Seoul Mun which runs alongside the canal. Aside from one road crossing, it's entirely uninterrupted and lightly filled with pedestrians. I ran this route a couple of times a week after 6PM and it was a great place to unwind. You'll find men cooling off from the heat, jumping into the surprisingly blue water, and families enjoying picnics in the parks alongside. ([Exact route](https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js))

**The coworking space**

The [Ground Zero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pufYnYbk88UuE76J7) space at Kitob Olami was a highlight and somewhere I loved coming into every day. Double-height ceilings with tonnes of natural light, a large library, powerful air conditioning and great quality desks and seats. There's a dark chill-out area with bean bags and some places to sleep, a small gym, dedicated phone booths and a rather primitive but effective in-house cafe. The staff are friendly, welcoming and speak decent English. They offer hourly, daily, weekly and monthly plans, so if you are looking for somewhere to get some work done, I'd strongly recommend checking it out. The cost for a month was around £100.

**The weather**

The 40-degree heat sounds oppressive on paper, but with next to no humidity, I found it surprisingly manageable. There are a couple of hours during the mid-afternoon where you probably don't want to be lingering for too long outside under the direct sun, but it never felt overbearing. I ran in the evenings when the temperature was in the high 30s with next to no problems. Infinitely more pleasant than, say, London when it reaches the high 20s.

# Things I liked 

**Samarkand**

I wouldn't personally travel across the world to visit Samarkand as it's not really my type of thing, but it's a perfect day/weekend trip from Tashkent. I wouldn't entertain the idea of working from there, however, in any shape or form and frankly was relieved to get out of there after 24 hours. Purely a spot to see the sights and head out.

**High-speed rail**

As a Brit still eagerly anticipating their country's first high speed rail line, I looked enviously at this piece of infrastructure. Quick, clean and excellent value by global standards. Book tickets as much in advance as possible using the surprisingly well [put together app](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pufYnYbk88UuE76J7).

**The Airbnb**

I stayed at the new [Akay City development](https://maps.app.goo.gl/41UQcR2GifSV6r4d6). Whilst it's still something of a building site, it was a comfortable base for a month. There are some retail developments at the base of the building and it's within easy walking distance to the coworking space mentioned above. [This particular Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1079746982822597761?source_impression_id=p3_1753335762_P3m7-XueVQ_7lDf8) was close to flawless and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a spacious, modern apartment.

**People**

Across the couple of months I've spent in Central Asia, I felt the warmest of receptions from the Uzbek people. Even though there's limited use of English, I felt a warm, genuine curiosity about why you'd chosen to visit their country. I'll remember plenty of jovial interactions from the people I met in daily life across the coworking spaces, gym and coffee shops. If you are a football fan, any mention of Abdukodir Khusanov, the young recent signing for Man City, is likely to be met with a particularly enthusiastic response.

**Quality landscaping and infrastructure**

Tashkent is a well put together city. You can tell there has been significant investment put into the landscaping and irrigation of public spaces to ensure it doesn't turn into yellow, scorched earth by midsummer. In particular, the [Memorial to the Victims of Repression in Tashkent](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EH4pYasaV9ijscZ86), the [Japanese Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F82bsCz2fgFrQazp8) and the [National Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tHv5SzYV2GC86fqQ8) are standout places to visit.

**Day-to-day costs**

Assuming you are earning in a foreign currency, Tashkent is generally great value. Eating out, taxis, coffees are all well below what you would expect to pay in the West. There are a few notable omissions with imported goods, but you're likely to not have to pay too much attention to your bank balance.

# Things I didn't like 

**The layout of the city**

Tashkent has something of a bizarre layout. What you would deem as the very centre around [Amir Timur Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mm7BZr4TxZmL5QMK6) appears to be mainly filled with administrative and educational facilities with a sparse selection of some restaurants and commercial activity around Bukhara Street.

This leaves the core of the traditional urban environment spread across numerous roads with small hubs of activity around metro stations.

Around Ming O'rik, Minor and Buyuk Ipak Yuli you have glimpses of activity, but not in a size or scale that make them interesting places to visit.

The City Mall is relatively decent as far as shopping complexes go, but even that is isolated next to a new commercial development that is a ghost town at the weekends.

If you head over to the area near the historic [Chorsu Bazaar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cxKWRzRbSKay1CtH7) then it begins to feel like you've lost all association with the 21st century, with the shiny modern sheen of the city firmly worn off.

Tashkent carries all the baggage of a major city in terms of its infrastructure, population and size, but with none of the excitement or energy that they generally all facilitate.

At the very least I generally always find one neighbourhood that truly resonates with me and I'll enjoy routinely walking around on foot or daydreaming about whether I could consider permanently living there, but this was a notable absence on this trip.

**Lack of bars**

Tashkent does have bars, but they tend to be dispersed all across the city with nowhere having a critical mass of them to create any form of buzz or excitement in the evening. Zero ‘*vibe*’ per se. I love getting a solitary beer after work, but this was something entirely absent from my daily routine. There are a few hookah lounges which act as something of a replacement, but even they are spread thinly. The country is evidently more conservatively Muslim than other neighbouring countries and whilst alcohol is consumed freely with no shortage of off-licences, it hasn't become a part of the fabric of public life. At the risk of dwelling on this for too long and sounding like an alcoholic, in isolation this is not an issue. But it compounds with several of the other issues mentioned to generate this somewhat subdued feeling.

**Detached from any compelling nature**

A major factor in why I loved Almaty and Bishkek was the proximity to the mountains. There is no real equivalent in Tashkent. One weekend I headed out to the canyon at [Водопад Таваксай](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Zmsd7BMu5MuW3a6b6) and ended up getting chased by some particularly wild and aggressive dogs. This lack of immediate access to nature would be fine if the city was a riveting, exciting place in itself, which it unfortunately is not. Yes, you can travel across the country, but I often like to take my weekends as they come, which doesn't work too well in the city.

**Very expensive gyms**

Gyms are bizarrely expensive in Tashkent. This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Uzbekistan/comments/1ctxny7/wtf_is_wrong_with_gyms_in_tashkent/) does a good job of explaining the likely reasons why. I paid around £55 for a morning-only membership in [ozone](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rvKW3PeU8A7cUCLi8) that resembles the poor end of a London council-owned BETTER setup. Small with old machines. If you are just passing through, you may want to opt for one of the outdoor calisthenics parks. These weren't ""foreigner getting scammed"" prices - just a weirdly underdeveloped industry in the country.

**Currency**

Tashkent was one of the few places across the world where I've defaulted to using cash in day-to-day transactions. Within 24 hours I experienced enough failed attempts with Apple Pay and a physical debit card that I just gave up and would take out 300,000 som every couple of days (£18). The wads of notes are somewhat impractical to carry around, particularly the 2,000 notes clogging up your wallet. There seems to be a real lack of 1,000 coins or notes so you will likely be issued a token sweet at a till in lieu of the correct change being issued.

**Drivers**

Tashkent is home to some horrendous drivers. I've never heard so many continuous wheel skids. Each  junction feels like a scene from the Fast & Furious, with one of the country's many Chevrolets flooring it in a particularly aggressive manner. It would be gravely dangerous to assume any form of priority at road junctions because of a green pedestrian light at a crossing. Cars undoubtedly rule the streets in Tashkent. The police operate manual junction signals during peak hours, which further compounds the confusion in terms of right of way.

**Dating**

I avoid talking about dating as usually even the very mention of it seems to trigger people into some bizarre comments. I'll lightly touch on it - for me personally it was not a good place for dating. For a city of 3 million there are very few women on the dating apps and there felt an almost insurmountable cultural barrier.",4,1753336676.0,digitalnomad,3,0.83,False

Leonardo didn't realize how deep he'd stabbed himself until he saw the wide-eyed face of his friend.

""Oh goodness Leo,"" Jessa chided. ""Be careful."" She already had a pouch of napkins open and pulled out a thick wad.

He looked down and saw he'd plunged the knife almost a full inch into the meat of his left palm. Blood leaked onto his plate and began to pool. He froze, holding the knife firmly in place even as pain broiled under his skin. It was bad, yes, but worse was the fleeting moment of ghostly disquiet that passed through him as he accidentally gored himself. She brought the napkins under his hand catching the blood, and reached for the knife.

""I can do it,"" he said, though not unkindly. ""Just tell me when.""

Jessa placed her left hand on the knife. Her fingers overlapped with his contrasting brilliantly, like cedar planks floating on a sea of cream. Their hands glowed in the soft light of the candlelit restaurant.

""I know you can,"" She said. ""But I'm a doctor remember?"" He lingered, then released the knife into her caring hands as the pool of blood grew into a lake. He would need to leave a big tip for the waiter. As she brought the napkins to the wound, he found himself astounded by their steadiness. She had the hands of a Goddess, carved from ancient and magical woods. They were plain, which made sense considering her profession. But when she held his hand and plucked the knife out, he felt them radiating with strength and confidence. Where his steadiness came from time in the gym and on the mat sculpting his body, hers came from time in the ER, sometimes plucking saw blades out of skulls.

She held pressure, keeping the napkin in place with her thumb and pinching the back of his hand with two of her other fingers. She cradled his hand with hers, talking about how they should get to the bathroom so he could wash it and avoid staining his bracelet. He just stared at her. She didn't check every box, not even close. She dressed simply and comfortably: milky white blouse, cobalt skirt, and wedges. This, in contrast to his own gray blazer, white button-down, and too stiff designer jeans.

And while she wore the same hair and makeup here as she did at the clinic, she also wore the same air of quiet confidence. He was intrigued.

""Hey, you're not trying to read me right now are you?"" He asked.

""No,"" she replied. ""But your mind is very open, like a vault with no door, so I wouldn't really need to 'try'. You should work on that. Also, have you even listened to a word I've said?""

He grew warm, thinking about his most recent, very private, thoughts.

""Yes, I'll be sure to wash it Jess in just a minute. But about my mind being an open door, I wasn't really trying to block you out at that time. Wha-""

""-t animal am I thinking of?"" She finished. ""Your favorite animal, a penguin. And I said **no** door not **open** door.""

""Damn,"" He said, and he gave her a lazy amused smile. Emboldened, Jessa decided to prompt him.

""Why penguins?"" She said. He kept his mouth shut and raised his eyebrow. ""Oh because of the way they waddle around on their little orange feet? Wow, that's so cute. I mean the penguins, you know? I think they're adorable-""

""Oh my God!"" The waiter screamed.

They turned, and saw him standing there looking as though he just witnessed his own murder.

He took an entire pad of napkins from his apron and threw them on the plate to soak up the blood. ""Are you OK sir!?"" Leo barely had time to reply before he said, ""I'm sorry I can't do blood. I need Karen to come get this-KAREN WE GOT AN EMERGENCY GET THE MED KIT!!!!""

Leo was about to speak up and tell him not to worry about it if he was going to lose his shit. But home was 45 minutes away, and the nearest pharmacy 2 blocks down Caroline Street.

The waiter stepped back as an older woman with a tag reading, ""General Manager: Karen D."" on her uniform came with a first aid kit. He heard the waiter gag as he walked away, and grimaced.

""Wow you really stuck yourself, huh?"" Karen said, sounding as chipper as a Mega-Church pastor on Sunday. ""Were y'all havin' a knife fight? Ha! Maybe a couples quarrel!? You better not hurt this lovely lady! Ha!"" Her laugh was a short, clipped thing that made him cringe. She opened the kit and rifled through it. Her face was flat, like the blade of a razor, with an impossibly smooth chin that almost melted into her neck. Leo thought briefly that if she laid down, he could put a penny on her nose, and it would roll cleanly all the way down to her bosom. Her white teeth practically jumped out of her mouth as she bore them in a cheek-splitting grin. She was the most surreal person Leonardo had ever met.

""Oh we're not a couple."" He said, with a short glance at Jessa who was looking around the restaurant. Karen ignored him.

""I've got everything right here."" She said, waving the large bandage in Jessa's face like a fan to get her attention. ""Ma'am, do you mind letting go for me please?""

""Oh, sure."" Jessa said, and released him taking the napkins with her and putting them on the plate with the rest of the bloody pile.

He had to stop himself from reaching for her hand again. Karen wiped the tissue fibers off his palm and slapped a bandage on him, the antibacterial cream packing right into the wound.

""Alright,"" She said, smoothing out the adhesive. ""If you need anything else just holler!"" She put the First Aid Kit under her arm, then picked up the plate. Before she walked away she said, ""Oh silly me, oh dearie me! I almost forgot your check! I'm sure you have a lot to do and need to get out of here what with Oktoberfest happening. You know, my son, oh he's such a little shit."" The not-a-couple glanced at each other. ""He told me he would be staying home tonight, studying for his test at 9 tomorrow-yes that's right AM guys-so here I am working hard for my boy, and I just saw him outside half drunk talking up some girl who will probably try to wring him dry. I'm slaving away for his future, and he's out there fucking around! Isn't that so ungrateful!?"" She put the plate down, and reached into her apron to grab the check. He watched as she set it down and her thumb, dripping with blood, left a clear imprint on the paper, like a crimson wax seal.

""... That's crazy,"" Leo said.

""Yeah. Fuck me right!? My own son!? Ha!"" She walked away cackling, as if she were the number one fan at her own private comedy show.

""Don't touch that."" Jessa said. ""I have cash."" As she pulled out her purse, he could hear the manager still laughing quietly behind him. He turned around to glance at her, but had to crane his neck and could only see her in his peripheral vision. She walked away in between various workers, then started to round a corner into the kitchen. It looked as though her bloody thumb was near her mouth, and he thought he saw a blurry pink mass flick out of her mouth before she disappeared. She never stopped laughing.

""Alright let's go."" Jessa said standing up. ""They can keep the change."" They strode past the fleet of empty tables and staff wishing them a happy Oktoberfest, and made a beeline for the door. She pushed it open and stepped out into the city with Leo tailing her. The air smelled warm and festive, but they couldn't enjoy it.

""I am embarrassed to admit how much I wanted out of there."" Leo said, taking a deep breath. ""Did you want to go to the pier and talk since we didn't get to finish our conversation? I wouldn't mind getting out of town for a bit.""

""No."" She replied. ""I would rather go somewhere public I think.""

""Ouch, but understandable."" He said. ""I guess this is our first time hanging out without the group.""

She groaned. ""That's not what I meant. I'm sorry. I trust you Leo and I know you wouldn't do anything. It's just that place didn't sit right with me, and we were the only customers there. I'd like to be around people, or get as far away from this place as possible.""

Her unease was palpable, and it didn't help that he had been feeling weird since he arrived in the city. Even as a low level psychic, he could still tell something was amiss.

""Let's go to Caesar's cafe,"" She said. ""That place is good right? You said so in our group chat.""

This surprised him. ""All the way near my place in King George? I don't know if you've been there, but it's a 40-minute drive without traffic.""

""Even better. The further, the better, actually. Didn't you say you wanted to get out of town? Also, I think you should wash that wound and get a proper bandage. The paper liner on the one she gave you was yellowing. They've probably had that same first aid kit since they opened.""

""Damn, good to know this band-aid is older than I am."" His voice grew louder as they walked down the street towards Oktoberfest. She followed behind him, red and orange leaves crunching under foot as they walked. ""Alright, how about this. Let's walk to the local drug store first. I'd rather change this bandage immediately."" She nodded in agreement. ""Then we'll hop in my car and head out to King George. You took the train here right?""

""I'll take an Uber back.""

He shook his head. ""No, I'll drive you.""

""I'm the one who wanted to go out that far."" She said. ""You drove all the way out here just to meet me at a place I could get to by train. And now you'll have to drive back home, then back out, and back home again? I can't make you do that.""

""You're not making me."" He said as they rounded the corner. They would only need to walk another block to reach the drug store, but the thought of driving far away from here quelled his unease. He unlocked the doors and the lights on his white Mercedes flashed. ""I want to do this. You have way better developed instincts than me, I know, but I'm still anxious as hell. I'd rather personally make sure you get home safe, rather than let you drive off with some murder mystery suspect driver, probably hopped up on crank, and one missed tip away from a shootout."" She snorted in laughter at Leo's colorful description.

""Well, OK then,"" she said, more than happy to be chauffeured by her crush. And she felt a little lighter.

""Well, OK then,"" He said turning back to her, his violet eye twinkling. He walked ahead and opened the passenger door. ""C'mon, hop in.""

""What about the local pharmacy?"" She asked. Though she complied and slid into the plush leather seat.

""I've changed my mind."" He said. ""Let's stop at a CVS. I want to get out of here too."" And he closed the door.

After driving about 10 minutes, he felt comfortable enough to stop at the next CVS Jessa had pointed out to him. She'd been on her phone the whole ride, silent except for the occasional ""left turn here for the next one"" or ""ones coming up next exit"".

They pulled into the parking lot and stepped inside. It was getting dark, and she opted to go with him, but her eyes barely left her phone as they walked in. After he'd gathered all the supplies and got to the self check-out, he turned to her and said, ""You OK? You haven't said much since we left. I'm still a bit on edge too, but I'm feeling a little better now.""

""Yes,"" She sighed, and looked up from her phone. ""I'm not usually this glued to my phone, I swear. I'm just trying to find more information about that restaurant, but there's nothing about the staff. They were weird weren't they?-wait hold on."" She stopped him before he hit pay and threw in a pack of gum, a bottle of iced coffee, and a king-size candy bar. ""If you pay for this we're even for dinner."" She smiled at him.

""Sounds good to me,"" he said. ""Dinner was like $20 right? I could use the extra cash. Thanks.""

""Sure,"" She said. ""Anyway about the staff? What did you think? It was kind of funny at first, but the more I thought about it, the more it didn't sit right. Especially that manager, she gave me chills.""

Leo grimaced at the final price. He'd watched that $20 shrink to $4.98 with every item that passed over the scanner. He didn't shop at chain pharmacies if he could help it, and now he remembered why. You had to pay double the price for the same stuff you could get from a department store. It was faster yes, but not $15.02 faster. At least he saved $5 on dinner.

""Um yeah,"" He said, scanning his card. At the mention of them, he began to feel his pulse thump against the bandage. ""Thanks for reminding me. I don't know about the staff, but the Manager was weird. She kinda looked like she had... I don't know she just wouldn't stop fucking laughing. Shit was freaky.""

Jessa looked up at him, inquisitive as always. ""No, I want details Leo. What do you *think* you saw?""

""Look,"" He said as he opened the packages and grabbed fresh antimicrobial cream and a couple of large band-aids. ""I'm going to go ahead and take care of my cut. Take my keys, and this stuff, and wait for me in the car."" He gave her the bag and looked through the glass doors at the dark skyline and distant stars. ""Actually, just wait for me here, OK? Then I'll let you read me and we can talk.""

""Ok,"" she agreed.

He went to the restroom, and did what needed to be done. The aging adhesive was already starting to peel, and he felt no pain when he ripped it off and threw it in the trash. He washed his hands thoroughly with soap and hot water, then applied the ointment and re-bandaged his palm. As he tended to his wound, he looked at himself in the mirror. A mask of terror hung on his face. Even this far from the riverside restaurant, he could still feel waves of energy radiating, though they were much weaker now. Jessa didn't seem to notice or be affected by them, he observed. Maybe because she's always got her walls up? He didn't know. The only thing he knew was that they needed to get the fuck out of Fredericksburg, and he needed to stay out until he could install a mental door big enough to block out whatever weird shit was going on out there. Maybe one three feet thick with titanium deadbolts. Resolved, he took just a few moments to clean himself up. He wet his good hand and ran it through his long hair. Then he smoothed out his shirt and jacket, and rubbed the gaunt out of his eyes. Satisfied with the man looking back at him in the mirror, he practiced a suave smile, and walked out to Jessa.",1,1753336673.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1m7wfb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1m7wfb6/i_added_a_leetcode_premium_feature_free_timespace/,I added a LeetCode Premium feature (free Time/Space Complexity) to my extension that syncs your solutions to GitHub.,"Hey everyone,

**TL;DR: I built a free Chrome extension called** [**leetpush**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetpush/fppdnbfkhpmppifbmmchnhpnmmickbin) **that automatically saves your LeetCode solutions to GitHub. The new update adds a free Time & Space Complexity Analyzer (like LeetCode Premium) and coding memes for fun.**

Like many of you, I'm constantly on **LeetCode** preparing for interviews. I got really tired of two things: manually copying my code to create a **GitHub portfolio** and not knowing my code's efficiency without paying for Premium.

So, I built a tool to fix it. It's called **leetpush**.

**What does it do?**

* **Automatic LeetCode to GitHub Sync:** Solved a problem? Bam. It's instantly committed to your GitHub repo. It's the easiest **LeetCode GitHub integration** you'll find.
* **\[NEW\] Free Complexity Analyzer:** This is the big one. After you solve a problem, the extension shows you the **Time and Space Complexity** (Big O notation). This is a game-changer for interview prep and something you normally have to pay for. It’s the perfect **LeetCode Premium alternative** for performance analysis.
* **\[NEW\] Coding Memes:** After a successful submission, it shows you a relevant meme. Because why not have a little fun while you grind?

I’m committed to keeping this tool 100% free and open-source. My goal is to help students and developers **save their LeetCode solutions** and learn more effectively.

Since this is a passion project, I’m not putting up a paywall. Instead, if you find the tool genuinely useful for building your **coding portfolio** or for the **free complexity analysis**, I've set up a ""Buy Me a Coffee"" page.

Any support would be incredible and will help me cover server costs and keep developing new features.

**Links:**

* **Install on Chrome:** [leetpush on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetpush/fppdnbfkhpmppifbmmchnhpnmmickbin)
* **Source Code & Details:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/singhJasvinder101/leetpush)

I'd love to hear your feedback. What do you think? Any features you'd like to see in the next **LeetCode automation** update?

1m7wf1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1m7wf1r/the_night_i_died_my_husband_of_25_years_was/,"The night I died, my husband of 25 years was watching fireworks with our children","# The night I died, my husband of 25 years was watching fireworks with our children. I called for him. I called his phone, hoping he would come.

""I'm busy,"" he said. ""Stop your whining and just come join us!""

""Matthew,"" I breathed out, my voice barely above a whisper.

""Is that Mom complaining that we're leaving her out again?"" I heard my son say. ""God she's annoying.""

""Dad, just hang up. She's going to have her tantrum one way or the other. Why let it ruin the night?"" I heard my daughter snark.

The phone dropped from my hand as my consciousness wavered and then finally collapsed.

Hours passed, and my family didn't even notice that I had not only not arrived for the fireworks display but had also stopped calling or texting.

When the display ended and my family gathered their belongings, they noticed I wasn't in the crowd.

""She's still having a tantrum,"" my daughter, Anna, said, rolling her eyes. ""She's probably at home sulking.""

""She's just being petulant,"" my son, Alex, said. ""Because we didn't wait for her to come.""

""I'll deal with her when we get home,"" Matthew, my supposed loving husband, said as he closed the trunk of his car once he'd stowed the picnic blankets and food I had carefully and lovingly packed for our family outing to watch the annual fireworks display our city put on for Founder's Day.

The three of them drove home expecting me to be there waiting.

They were surprised when they got to our house and saw that none of the lights were on.

""Even if she goes to sleep before us, Mom always leaves a light on,"" Alex said, frowning in confusion.

""She's being childish,"" Anna said. ""She didn't get her way because we asked her to go grab something and she wasn't back when we were ready to go.""

And that was true.

Before we planned to leave, Anna and Alex asked for a specific drink we could only find at one store across town. They insisted they had to have the drink at the fireworks display, as it was their tradition. I had forgotten to buy the drink, so I had to go out and get it for them.

It's not like they are incapable of driving. They both have licences and they each have their own cars. But my supposedly loving husband, with whom I had raised our two children, giving up my position at a law firm in the city to stay home with, argued that I had neglected to get it in all my preparations for the evening's event. Therefore, I was responsible for rectifying it by going across town during rush hour to retrieve this precious drink.

And so, because I had devoted my life to the happiness of my husband and children, often to the sacrifice of my own happiness and comfort, I got into my car and headed out, asking only that they wait for my return before leaving for the fireworks.

I never made it to the store.

On the way, a terrible accident was on the highway ahead of me. I maneuvered around it but was blindsided by a truck that had decided to speed around the accident site and had hit my car, forcing it off the road and down an embankment. I lost consciousness as my car rolled to the bottom of the embankment and landed against a tree.

By the time I came around, the sun had set. My vision was blurry, and my left leg felt like it was on fire. The car's roof had collapsed somewhat, and the car had come to rest against the tree, and I was still strapped into my seat. I heard nothing around me but the sound of traffic on the highway above. I didn't even see any flashing lights of any emergency vehicles. Was it possible that not one driver had noticed my car get hit by that truck? Had the truck driver not reported that he'd hit a car and thrown it down the embankment?

With much difficulty and much pain, I very carefully undid my seatbelt, using my left leg to brace myself against the middle console. I pulled at the cracked sunroof and dragged my broken and bruised body through it, managing a couple of nice, deep gashes courtesy of the shattered glass.

Thankfully, my phone had been in my pocket while I was driving, so I tried to retrieve it once I got away from the car and lay on my back in the dirt disturbed by the rolling car.

Above my head, I could see that the fireworks display had begun. I didn't know how much time had passed and how much of the display was left. I pressed Matthew's contact on my phone.

""What do you want?"" was how he answered when he picked up. ""We waited until we couldn't wait any longer. Where are you? It's ten minutes back and forth and you never bothered to show up. You didn't even come here to meet us. You know this display is important to the twins and I and you couldn't even manage to get everything prepared correctly.""

I was trying to stay conscious as he berated me for something that was out of my control.

""You've disappointed the twins by conveniently forgetting their favourite drink, and then by being petulant and immature and not even bothering to come home in time to leave with us. Now the display is almost over and you still haven't shown up,"" he continued.

""Where is she?"" I heard Anna ask.

""Who cares anymore?"" Alex said. ""Just tell her we're busy and to meet us here or whatever. She's probably mad we didn't wait for her.""

""I'm busy,"" Matthew said. ""Stop your whining and just come join us.""

""Matthew,"" I breathed out, my voice barely above a whisper. I was trying to get him to hear me. I was trying to get him to hear that my life was ebbing out of me. I didn't know it, but one of the cuts on my legs had sliced a small cut into a femoral vein and nicked the artery. I was bleeding out but all I felt was cold and tired.

""Is that Mom complaining that we're leaving her out again?"" I heard my son say. ""God she's annoying.""

""Dad, just hang up. She's going to have her tantrum one way or the other. Why let it ruin the night?"" I heard my daughter snark.

My consciousness collapsed, and slowly, my life ebbed away. I died, alone, at the bottom of an embankment, unseen by the world above.



""I can't believe she's being so childish,"" Alex said as they walked into the dark house. ""I mean, fine. Don't show up to the fireworks. She made her point. But to make it look like we aren't even welcome in our own home? So stupid.""

""What do you expect?"" Anna said to her brother. ""She's immature and just playing one of her stupid games. I bet she's sitting in the living room, just stewing. And I'll also bet that no matter how upset she is, which is dumb, she's still got our bedtime snack ready and waiting.""

Every night before the kids went to bed, I made them a snack. Something light, but filling and healthy. Some fruit and cheese and a cup of warm milk, sometimes hot chocolate, just to send them to sleep with full bellies and warm thoughts. Tonight, however, I hadn't made their snack. I hadn't warmed milk for them. I hadn't come home because my now-dead body was at the bottom of the embankment.

Matthew turned on the foyer light as they entered the house.

""Amelia!"" he shouted. ""Stop this petty game! You couldn't even turn on a light? How childish are you? If I had known I had married a child I wouldn't have had to have children!""

The twins looked at their father.

""You know I don't mean I didn't want you to be born. I'm making a point that I don't need to raise another child when I've raised the two of you already,"" he explained. They smiled and nodded.

Alex and Anna were the apples of their father's eye. They could do no wrong. When they were young and would fight over a toy, Matthew's instinct was to blame me for not getting each their own toy, and then immediately would go to get the other twin an identical toy. This had ruined entirely the lesson I had been trying to teach them about learning to share with others. All they knew was that if they complained enough, their father would buy them what they wanted, while their mother was the mean one who kept all the fun away from them.

When Alex was close to failing his junior year of high school, Matthew blamed me for not tutoring him enough, or if I wasn't smart enough to help him, then I should hire a tutor who was. Intelligence wasn't my problem. I was quite capable of helping Alex with his homework. Whenever I tried to sit down with him, he would immediately stop listening, talk over me, and insist I didn't know what I was talking about. He refused to listen to me and my explanations of the concepts in his junior law course. He told me I was stupid and knew nothing about the laws.

He didn't notice that I had written the textbook his school used. It was under my maiden name, but that didn't change the fact that that text was mine and I knew those laws inside and out. And Matthew never corrected either of the twins when they told him I was stupid.

Matthew and I had met in college when I was a freshman and pre-law. He was in a business program and some of my pre-law classes overlapped with his business law classes, seeing as us pre-law students would likely wind up working for and with some of the business students as legal representation in their businesses.

Our courtship had been one you'd only read about in fairy tales. The whole 'swept me off my feet' type of love. The 'foot popping' first k1ss.

Matthew was handsome. Many of the girls in my class, and his, wanted to date him. I won't lie. I did too. But I knew I was just one of many who was interested in Matthew Davenport.

I didn't pursue him. I didn't throw myself at his feet (not intentionally, anyway). I would say hello to him if our paths crossed on campus, outside of class, or at parties we both attended. I watched from afar as my classmates, and his, vied for his attention. I would smile to myself as I watched some of the tricks and tactics other girls tried to get his attention with. My friends and I often laughed together at some of the antics we had watched our peers put themselves through.

Matthew was a bit of a mystery. Everyone knew he came from a wealthy family. Everyone knew he was expected to take over his family's business after he graduated. And Matthew was a serious student. He did, however, struggle with some of the law classes he had to take, and therefore my professor assigned me as his tutor. As the top student in the business law class, it only made sense.

""I don't get why I have to learn all this when I can just hire you when you become a lawyer and you can deal with all this stuff!"" He cried, exasperated, one night during a tutoring session where he was having trouble with two similar concepts with very different results.

""You need to know this because if you're the one running the business, you need to know if the issue will be a detriment or an asset if it becomes a legal issue. This is the type of stuff you don't want to come across in business. You need to be able to recognize the problem before you have to hire a lawyer.""

I explained the difference once again.

I tutored Matthew for the entire semester. In return, he often treated my roommates and I to dinner, replaced a couple of pieces of broken furniture and even bought us a new microwave when ours decided it no longer wanted to do its job.

We had never asked for any of it and even tried to decline the microwave.

""Honestly, it's the least I can do. I passed my law final thanks to you, and if I hadn't had you as a tutor, Amelia, I am one hundred percent convinced I would have flunked the whole class. So as a thank you, please accept the microwave,"" he'd said.

It was a top of the line model that was well outside our price range. But we did accept it, graciously, and invited him over for a movie night where he got to witness the first use of the appliance as we made popcorn.

Matthew was sweet, and kind. And while I admit I had a crush on him, I thought he was out of my league. I was happy enough to consider him a friend.

Fast forward three years, Matthew and I graduated. He completed his studies release Laude and I completed my pre-law undergraduate degree Magna release Laude. I had law schools vying for my application. Scholarship offers and bursaries were pouring in. My roommates and Matthew all helped me decide where to attend law school.

At the end of the year, before we all had to move out of our dorms or apartments, Matthew and his roommates threw a huge end of year bash off campus. Of course he invited my roommates and me.

""I can't not invite the woman who made business law less of a hellscape!"" He said as he handed me the flyer for the party. It was being held in a rather exclusive bar and rumor had it that Matthew had rented out the entire place just for the party. I couldn't say no. I wouldn't have ever been able to get into this bar otherwise.

The night of the party, my roommates and I helped each other get ready. We wanted to look our best though we all came from relatively humble backgrounds. My parents were divorced with my father off in some foreign country with his mistress and my mother making an honest living as a nurse in our local hospital. I had gotten into university on scholarships and had worked as a tutor for some extra cash. My mother still had my brother and sister to support, so I did my best to be as little of a financial burden as possible. Even still, she sent me some money occasionally, just to remind me that she was still in my corner. She told me all the time how proud she was of me, and I thanked her every time for the money she sent, usually trying to save it to either take her out to dinner when I graduated, or to use for something special for all four of us when I did.

Emma, Roberta, Callie, my roommates, and I shared a rideshare to the party. Even the driver was impressed when we pulled up.

""Nice place,"" he whistled. ""So I've heard. How'd you get so lucky to get an invite in here?""

""A friend,"" I said, sliding out of the car. We thanked the driver and headed to the door.

""Invite?"" The bouncer at the door asked.

""Invite? We were only given a flyer. And it didn't say anything about needing to bring it,"" I said to the large man at the door.

""The flyer was the invite. Everyone knows to bring the flyer. If you don't have it, I can't let you in. University class only.""

""We're from the university!"" We protested, pulling out our student ID cards.

""You could have had those made at any copy place,"" the bouncer said, unimpressed.

I blew out a breath in frustration.

""Danny, they're fine,"" a voice said. ""They're with me.""

I looked up and there was our knight in shining... Armani? Matthew Davenport in a well tailored suit looking every bit the import/export magnate he was destined to be.

""Apologies, Mr. Davenport,"" the bouncer said, stepping back. ""They didn't have their flyer.""

""No worries, good man,"" Matthew smiled. ""You were just doing your job. I appreciate that. We don't want anyone uninvited. But these four are definitely invited. Come on, ladies. Come in.""

Matthew grinned at us, the bouncer smiled and we thanked them both as we stepped into the bar.

The place was amazing. The interior looked like we had walked into a bar carved out of a glacier. Glass and lights created the illusion of ice and snow. Everything was bathed in blue light, and everything in the bar—all the tables, counters, chairs, sofas, and furniture—was all white, creating the illusion of a bar literally frozen in ice. It was magnificent.

""It's an open bar, but be mindful, hmm?"" Matthew said over the music. I felt his hand lightly on my back. He leaned close to me.

""You clean up quite nicely,"" he whispered in my ear. I blushed. Throughout school I had dressed in comfortable, casual clothes, preferring loose sweats and jeans over suits, dress pants or skirts. I was there to learn, not for a fashion show.

""As do you, Mr. Davenport,"" I smiled. Matthew had dressed more casually in school, too. But usually in jeans or slacks, sneakers or loafers and t-shirts or button down shirts. Rarely in shorts or sweats unless he was playing football in the quad with his friends.

""Come to the bar. Let me get you a drink. I've got a signature cocktail,"" he said, guiding me towards the glass topped 'ice cube' in the middle of the large space.

Matthew indicated to the bartender that he wanted two of his cocktails and a minute later, a blue drink in a martini glass was in front of me.

""To graduation and what lies beyond,"" Matthew said, his smile making it all the way up to his eyes.

""To the future,"" I responded.

We clinked glasses and I took a sip of the blue drink.

It was sweet and delicious. It tasted of raspberries and lemon.

""This is good. What's it called?""

""The Amelia,"" he said, looking me straight in the eyes over the rim of his glass.

I stared at him. He'd named the drink after me?

Matthew led me to a couch in the corner, indicating to the bartender to send over two more in a couple of minutes. He sat me down and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders.

""You intrigue me,"" he said to me.

""How so?"" I asked.

""I know you have a crush on me, my buddy Tyler told me,"" he smiled at me. I felt my cheeks redden. Tyler was Emma's boyfriend, and no doubt she'd told him.

""But unlike every other girl in this school, you never put on an act. You never act like you're just here to get your MRS,"" he said. I frowned at him.

""MRS?"" I asked, unsure what degree that was.

""Mrs. Davenport. Some - a lot - of girls come to university looking for a husband, not a career. And a lot of the girls in our classes, well, you're not blind and you're not stupid. You've seen how girls act around me. I don't want to come across as narcissistic or selfish. I know I'm not ugly. I know I'm kinda good-looking. I'm lucky in that way, I guess. But the way girls around here throw themselves at people like me. They want my money. My family's money, our status, the things that people in my position are not entitled to, exactly. That sounds gross, but the perks, I guess, of having money.

""I'm not naive, Amelia. I know that in terms of birth, I won a lottery somehow. My parents have done well for themselves, and my grandparents have done well for themselves. I know I'm extremely lucky. I know I grew up in lucky cirreleasestances.""

""What does any of that have to do with me?"" I asked.

""You don't seem to care one way or the other whether I even look in your direction. And yet, when you were asked to tutor me, you didn't say no,"" he said.

""Why would I? A fellow student needed help, and I was able to help. So I did,"" I said.

""And yet, in all that time together, you never once made a move. You stuck to the topics at hand and got me through my exams, and not once did you even hint at, well, anything,"" he said.

""I'm not sure if you're trying to compliment me or not,"" I frowned.

My drink was empty, and the bartender had come by with our refills. I took a sip of my second drink.

""Compliment. Entirely. I promise,"" Matthew said, watching me over his own glass. I looked back at him, not letting him try to intimidate me.

""So, after graduation, I assume you're going to law school,"" Matthew said, changing the subject.

""Of course,"" I said. What was the point of being pre-law if I wasn't going actually to go ahead and get a law degree?

""Have you chosen which school yet?"" he asked, interested.

""I'm deciding between two. I have another two weeks before I have to put in my final decision,"" I said.

""What's the criteria you're trying to decide on?"" he asked.

""Distance, how much scholarship they're offering and whether they have the law program I want,"" I replied.

""Why is distance a factor?"" Matthew asked.

""I don't want to be too far from home,"" I replied. ""My mom is a single mom and she still has my younger brother and sister at home. I want to be able to go back home and visit, help her out a little bit, and be available if needed.""

""Ah. What about your dad? How old are your brother and sister?"" Matthew asked.

""My dad left us when I was sixteen. He's off in some other country with his wh0re,"" I said, and then slapped my hand over my mouth. Matthew laughed heartily.

""I love an honest woman,"" he said, joy in his eyes. ""So, how old are your siblings?""

""Kieran is fourteen and Alecia is twelve,"" I said.

""Fun. My brother is twenty, just started university and, according to my father, not doing much. He's basically the spare. My dad planned on handing the business to me, and I've been groomed my whole life to take it over. My brother is a bit more of a free spirit and doesn't really have any direction. Which is too bad, because he's really smart,"" Matthew said.

I had no response to that. My brother and sister were also pretty smart, but with Kieran just starting high school and Alecia finishing middle school, I didn't have anything with which to compare.

I spent the remainder of the night with Matthew close by. When I went to dance, he joined us. When I went to relax, he took me to his VIP spot and we sat with my roommates and some of his friends.

It wasn't until the night's end that I 'threw myself' at his feet. And I blame the alcohol, one hundred percent.

I had had at least four of Matthew's potent signature cocktails, and I hadn't had much to eat before coming out. Returning to the VIP area, I tripped up the steps and landed on the floor at Matthew's feet.

""Now you throw yourself at me,"" he laughed as he helped me get up.

""I think now is probably a good time for me to go home,"" I slurred.

Matthew helped Emma, Roberta, and Callie get me out of the bar and into a car.

""Make sure she drinks some water and maybe give her an Advil before she goes to bed,"" Matthew told my roommates. I grinned sloppily up at him.

""Thanks, Mr. Davenport, for the wonderful evening,"" I said, drunkenly. ""I just hope I remember it.""

Matthew chuckled as he closed the door and the car drove off.

The following morning, I did not feel well at all. My head was pounding, and my tongue felt like I had spent the night licking the lint trap in the dryer. I groaned as the sunlight streamed into my room.

I dragged my sorry butt out of bed, forced myself into a shower and, bleary eyed, wandered into the kitchen. Emma handed me a cup of coffee.

""Had fun last night, did you,"" she smirked at me. I groaned back.

The doorbell rang just then, which did no wonders for my head. I sat at our kitchen table and put my head in my arms.

""Amelia?"" Emma said, her voice confused and delighted. I looked up, and Matthew was standing in our doorway, a grin on his face and several take-out bags in his hands.

""Good morning,"" he said—way too cheerfully for this time of day, too cheerful for my headache.

""Hi,"" I groaned.

""I suspected you might be feeling a little under the weather this morning,"" he smiled, holding up the bags. ""So I brought my tried, tested and true hangover cure.""

I looked at the bags, oil and grease adorning them.

""Well, I suppose if I have a heart attack from all the grease, I won't have to worry about the hangover,"" I muttered. Matthew laughed.

I had to admit, though, the greasy food actually did make me feel better.

A few weeks later, we were all heading our separate ways, and I really didn't give Matthew much thought. I returned home for the summer, having chosen which school to attend in the fall.

I worked a summer job at our local library while my siblings enjoyed their summer off and Mom worked as hard as ever.

At the end of August, I left home again for a law school only three hours away. Far enough to need to stay on or around campus, close enough to be home in an emergency, or when I wanted to be.

I focused solely on my studies, not much on the world beyond law school.

Occasionally, I'd hear about Matthew and the Davenport's businesses and successes. But for the most part, it was information on the periphery. My world consisted primarily of law classes, studying, and ensuring Mom was okay.

After graduation, I worked incredibly hard at my articling job, hoping to be hired by the top law firm in the city. I had been snatched up by Hoffman, Givens, and Pratt as a junior law clerk after graduation and was encouraged to stay. I wanted to prove my worth. And I did—to the point that my professors still called me, and one asked me to co-write the law textbook my future son would tell me I knew nothing about.

Been drinking coffee basically everyday since I was 12, I'm 20 now. Made myself a coffee at work the other day and immediately got a massive headache after the first sip and ended up throwing it out.

I've always had trouble getting to sleep and waking up on time and have always struggled with headaches. Always put it down to alcohol, smoking, or excessive screen time. 

In the last few months I have gone from drinking 6 beers and smoking cigs basically everyday and spending hours watching insta reels to quitting all of those things entirely (for now, God willing). But the headaches and sleep are even worse. 

I think quitting coffee and energy drinks is probably the logical next step, but I have a feeling it's going to be the hardest. I'm scared of my headaches and sleep getting even worse. Any advice or tips for me? Would appreciate it to help me on my journey.

1m7wcel,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m7wcel/quitting_this_marriage_and_you/,Quitting This Marriage — And You,"The 444th time they drew her blood, she lay in the sterile isolation room, her body feeling like it had been crushed to pieces. She could hear the doctor's desperate voice trying to stop what was happening...

""Mr. Seibert, if you keep pushing her like this, Ms. Caylor's body will completely collapse!""

The room fell into an eerie silence, but as long as Vincent didn't say stop, nobody dared to remove the needle.

Alice stared at her blood pouring through the tube as her body grew colder little by little, and her eyes started to lose focus as darkness closed in.

Her breathing grew shallower and slower, and just as she was about to lose consciousness, she heard Vincent's cold voice. ""Keep going. Juliana can't wait any longer.""

Right then, she finally realized she had always just been a living medicine for that woman.

When she next opened her eyes, she found herself back five years earlier—on the very day she was forced into the phlebotomy room for the first time.

A cold needle stabbed into her spine, making her fingers quiver from the sharp pain. The nurse noticed her pale face and hesitated before asking, ""Ms. Caylor, this surgery is very dangerous. Are you... Really willing to do this?""

Before the nurse could finish, a low and cold voice sounded from the doorway. ""She is, of course.""

Alice slowly lifted her head and locked eyes with Vincent's cold, merciless gaze.

Memories of everything she had suffered came rushing back.

She had loved him for 12 long years, but all he did in return was hold his beloved crush close and tell the doctor, ""I don't care if you drain every drop of her blood.""

In her previous life, it was at the high school freshman opening ceremony that she first fell for Vincent, who stood confidently on the podium giving a speech.

She spent three years chasing after him, brought him breakfast every single day for a year, stayed with him in the library until midnight to help him study, and even carried him to the school clinic when he hurt himself playing basketball.

But Vincent always kept a cold distance from her, and he even gave back the love letter she had poured her heart into without bothering to read it.

When she finally worked hard enough to get accepted into his college, she saw him holding Juliana Flynn's hand during the opening ceremony, boldly declaring in front of all the teachers and students, ""This is the only person I will ever love.""

People around her whispered that Vincent had truly fallen for Juliana and urged Alice to move on as soon as she could.

But no matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't let go.

She saw him waiting outside the girls' dormitory in the pouring rain all night long, hoping the sick Juliana would forgive him.

She watched him smash a priceless emerald necklace into pieces only because Juliana said, ""I hate feeling tied down by things like this.""

She also witnessed him set off a multimillion-dollar fireworks show on the rooftop of the Seibert Group's building to celebrate Juliana's birthday, making sure the entire city saw how crazy he was about her.

Alice felt like a pitiful outsider, silently observing this intense love story but unable to leave even the smallest mark in his heart.

So when Vincent begged her to save Juliana for the first time, she somehow found herself asking him to marry her instead.

""She can still vividly recall how red his eyes were that day.

His shock, shame, and resistance eventually turned into hopeless acceptance.""

He told her, ""Fine, if being Mrs. Seibert is what you want, I'll let you have it. But you need to go donate your blood now.""

Later on, she did end up becoming his wife, like she had always dreamed.

But what did it even matter?

Their marriage certificate was kept locked away in a safe, but his heart remained forever with Juliana.

Every corner of the house was filled with photos of Juliana, even the nightstand in the main bedroom held a framed picture of her.

Whenever Vincent touched Alice, he whispered Juliana's name instead of hers.

In the end, he personally forced her onto the surgery table, ignoring whether she lived or died, and took every drop of her blood to save Juliana.

As the anesthetic started flowing into her veins, Alice finally understood how foolish she had been.

She had made a terrible mistake.

Vincent's heart only ever truly belonged to Juliana.

She should never have trapped him in a marriage by using such cruel tricks.

She finally realized that his kindness was always meant only for Juliana.

She shouldn't have been so naive to think a marriage certificate could make him stay.

A relationship built on force will always be filled with pain.

But she only came to see this after she lost her life.

\*\*\*

As she drifted in and out of her memories, the blood bag had already filled up.

Vincent picked up the blood bag and turned to walk out, but Alice called out to stop him, ""Our marriage...""

He halted, his tone annoyed as he replied, ""Don't worry, I'll keep my word. Everything's set up at the City Hall. You can go by yourself later.""

Alice thought back to her previous life, when she stood all alone outside the City Hall, clutching the marriage certificate and crying helplessly.

There had been no wedding ceremony, no honeymoon, not even a simple pair of wedding rings.

Watching Vincent's figure as he moved to leave, she slowly shook her head. ""That's not what I meant.""

She wanted to put an end to this absurd marriage.

In this lifetime, she would never fall in love with him again.

But right as she was about to walk away, a nurse called after her, ""Miss, don't forget your bag!""

Alice reached to grab it but didn't get a good grip, and the bag slipped from her hands onto the floor.

All the items inside spilled out everywhere, and as she squatted down to pick them up, she was shocked to find Juliana's ID card and a stack of legal documents.

It was only then that she recognized the unfamiliar designer bag as Juliana's.

A wild thought suddenly popped into her head.

About 30 minutes later, she stepped out of the City Hall holding a newly issued marriage certificate.

Two names were printed clearly on the certificate: Vincent and Juliana.

As she looked at the freshly signed marriage certificate, she finally let out a calm, relieved smile.

In this lifetime, she had personally delivered the woman he loved back into his arms.

And now, she could completely step away from this ridiculous love triangle drama.

**Chapter 2**

After leaving the City Hall, Alice tried calling Vincent over ten times, but he never picked up.

Feeling weak from losing too much blood, she almost collapsed and had no choice but to head home to rest.

The following day, she pushed herself to visit the hospital again.

Through the glass window of the hospital room, she saw Vincent gently helping Juliana sit upright, like he was handling something incredibly delicate.

""Eat slowly, it's hot.""

He softly blew on the oatmeal in the spoon, his eyes filled with a tenderness she had never seen before.

Alice suddenly remembered that in her previous life, when she was lying in bed with a fever reaching 39.8 degrees Celsius, even a glass of water had to be poured by a nurse, because no one else did.

She took a long breath outside the hospital room, then lightly tapped on the door.

When Vincent turned and saw her, the warmth in his face instantly disappeared.

He rushed outside, closed the door behind him, and stared at her, eyes red with anger.

""Are you stalking me?""

Alice calmly held out the unfamiliar designer bag and a marriage certificate.

""I just came to give these back, and also to let you know...""

""Enough!"" he cut her off before she could finish.

He yanked the bag from her hand and hissed, ""Juliana can't handle any stress right now. If you dare say even a single word—""

Alice interrupted him, ""It's not about us. The marriage certificate clearly shows you and—""

""Alice!""

Suddenly, Vincent grabbed her by the wrist.

""Don't think you can use this to threaten me!

""If it weren't for Juliana, I wouldn't even bother talking to you!""

He yanked the marriage certificate from her hand and shoved it into his suit pocket without even glancing at it. Then, without another word, he turned around and headed back into the hospital room.

As the door clicked shut, Alice could still hear Juliana's soft voice from inside. ""Vincent, who was that?""

""Just a delivery person,"" he replied.

Alice stared at the closed door and let out a quiet laugh.

She thought to herself, ""Well, once he realizes the name on that marriage certificate, his reaction will be priceless.""

She didn't bother staying any longer. She had already made up her mind to leave, and sooner or later, he'd find out the truth written on that document.

Without slowing down, she stepped into the elevator and pressed the button.

Inside, a few young nurses were chatting in hushed voices, visibly excited.

""The guy in the VIP room is the heir of the Seibert Group! I heard he flew in an elite medical team from overseas just to save his girlfriend!""

Another nurse whispered, ""That's not all. I heard his girlfriend needed a rare blood type, and guess what? He found someone who matched, and they took nearly 2,000 ml of her blood!""

""Oh my God, that's next-level devotion!""

Alice stood silently off to the side, her fingers digging into her palms without her realizing it.

Yes, he was devoted—deeply so.

For Juliana, he was willing to give up everything, even marry a woman he didn't love.

But this time, she wouldn't give him that chance again.

As she walked out of the hospital and tilted her head up toward the sun, the bright light made her eyes sting.

She waved a taxi by the roadside. ""To the embassy,"" she said.

In her previous life, she turned down her acceptance to the OCAD University in Canada just to stay close to Vincent and always be on call as his personal ""blood bank.""

But this time, she was determined to chase the dream she had abandoned for too long.

""All your documents are in order,"" the visa officer said, adjusting his glasses. ""You'll hear back within two weeks.""

Alice noted the time needed for her visa to be approved, left the embassy, hailed another taxi, and headed back.

Once she got home, she started going through all the memories she had collected about Vincent over the years.

Back in high school, she used to secretly save his old homework sheets.

During college, she quietly filmed him whenever he played sports.

She even kept the ticket from the only ""date"" they had after getting married.

From falling for him at 15 to passing away in surgery at 27, she had loved him for 12 years. But in return, all she got was a cold sentence, ""I don't care if you drain every drop of her blood.""

After two long days of packing, when the last box was carried to the front door, Alice suddenly noticed it was raining.

""Miss, are you sure you want to throw all of this away?"" the housekeeper asked, uncertain, holding an umbrella over her.

""Yes, all of it,"" she replied.

The words had barely left her mouth when a pair of blinding headlights flashed through the rain.

A black Maybach stopped harshly in front of the gate, splashing water that soaked the hem of her clothes.

The window rolled down, and Vincent's cold face looked even sharper in the rain.

""You're really in a rush,"" he said, glancing at the boxes. His tone was colder than the rain. ""Juliana just got out of the hospital; she needs peace and quiet. Don't go bothering her with this trash.""

Alice froze for a second, then suddenly burst out laughing.

""No need to worry, Mr. Seibert. These are heading straight to the garbage dump. I never planned on bringing them to your place...""

""As long as you're not taking them there, I don't care where they end up. Get in the car,"" Vincent cut her off, giving the driver the signal to unlock the back door. Alice looked at him, puzzled. A flicker of confusion crossed her face. She asked, ""Where are we going?""

**Chapter 3**

""Professor Lukyn saw you the last time you went to the City Hall,"" Vincent said, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel, his tone sharp and distant.

""Juliana will be at the alumni gathering tonight. Come with me and clear things up.""

That's when Alice remembered how, in her previous life, she got too excited during the alumni gathering and shared a photo of their marriage certificate with her classmates.

That night ended with Juliana throwing a tantrum in front of Vincent.

Now, in this life, even though she hadn't done anything, she still couldn't avoid the same mess.

She replied calmly, ""Alright.

""I'll explain everything.""

The black Maybach stopped in front of a five-star hotel. Without saying a word, Vincent grabbed her wrist and hurried her toward the banquet hall.

Suddenly, as they passed a corner, he pushed her against the wall and looked at her with warning in his eyes.

""Say you were helping your cousin with some documents. If you say anything else...""

""I get it,"" Alice cut him off, clearly uninterested in hearing more.

""Don't worry. I won't let anyone think we're married.""

After all, it was Juliana's name written clearly on that marriage certificate. She was just returning it to its rightful owner.

Once he heard her promise, Vincent released her and walked ahead into the banquet hall.

He said, ""Juliana is right over there, so go talk to the others first.""

As soon as she opened the doors to the golden banquet hall, loud voices and shouts instantly filled the air around her.

""Alice!""

Her old college class representative was the first to rush up to her.

""The group chat is blowing up—people are saying you and Vincent were seen at the City Hall!""

""We've all heard the rumors!"" the arts representative said, eagerly waving her phone. ""You really kept it a secret from us!""

A group of seven or eight girls quickly circled around her, their voices excited. ""Hey, bride-to-be! Come on, spill it! When's the wedding?""

Alice's eyes drifted toward Vincent, who wasn't far away.

She saw him carefully draping a coat over Juliana's shoulders, while Juliana tightly gripped the edge of his sleeve with her pale fingers.

""That's not true!"" Alice suddenly raised her voice, loud enough for Vincent to hear clearly.

""I only went there to drop off my cousin's ID card. It wasn't me getting married.""

""Drop off your cousin's ID? Come on, who would believe that?""

One of Alice's old college roommates wrapped an arm around her shoulder.

""Back in junior year, you had a high fever and still brought Vincent an umbrella in the rain. You ended up in the hospital with pneumonia for a week.""

""And during graduation, you drank to stop him from drinking too much and landed in the emergency room with alcohol poisoning...""

Alice faintly remembered the time she almost died from alcohol poisoning, but what stuck with her the most was hearing Vincent say to Juliana through the hospital window, ""See? This is what happens when you insist on pestering me.""

But now, she was only 22, just six months out of college, and she still had her whole future ahead of her. Since life had given her a second chance, she had no interest in getting involved with Vincent ever again. She reached into her bag, pulled out the single status affidavit she had brought along, and showed everyone the part that clearly said ""single"" under the statement. Once they saw it, they finally believed she wasn't married. A few people looked surprised. After reading it, the arts representative suddenly said, ""Wait... then who did Vincent go to the City Hall with?""

""Probably Juliana!"" someone nearby jumped in right away, excitedly.

""Remember how at the college's opening ceremony, he said he'd never marry anyone else but her?""

""But Juliana's family..."" the class representative muttered, lowering his voice.

""Her dad took his own life last year because of gambling, and her mom's still in a psychiatric hospital. There's no way the Seibert family would accept that...""

""You don't get it!"" Vincent's roommate cut in quickly, clearly worked up.

""Vincent's been running the Seibert Group for a while now!

""Last year, he even froze the family investment fund just for Juliana—forced Sir Seibert to personally get her mom out of the psychiatric hospital for treatment!""

Alice stood there listening to all of this, and suddenly, she found the whole situation laughable.

Everyone else had seen the truth clearly, but she was the only one who naively believed that the guy who broke her heart would ever come back to her.

Just then, Vincent showed up with Juliana by his side. Juliana glanced around, puzzled by what was going on.

""Propose? What do you mean, propose?""

A sudden thought seemed to hit her, and her heart started beating faster. She quickly turned toward Vincent, her eyes full of hope.

""Vincent... are you about to propose to me?""

Vincent almost said ""no,"" but when he saw the hope on Juliana's face, he couldn't bring himself to say it.

He was aware that she had always dreamed of him proposing, but the truth was, he had already legally married Alice. There was no way he could become Juliana's husband now.

He wanted her to keep living and smiling, but he didn't want to be the reason behind her crushed hopes.

After thinking for a moment, he glanced over at Alice, then turned back and gave a slight nod.

""Yes, Juliana... I do want to propose to you.""

**Chapter 4**

As soon as the words left Vincent's mouth, the banquet hall broke into chaos.

""Do it now! Do it!""

The entire hall erupted with loud cheers and excitement.

In the middle of the noise, Vincent's eyes wandered toward a quiet corner.

Alice sat quietly, looking down at her phone, the screen's cold light hiding her expression.

He spoke in a tight voice, ""It's all too sudden.

""I haven't even got the ring ready...""

""You're all I need!"" Before he could finish, Juliana threw herself into his embrace, crying into his shirt.

From the side, Alice watched them hug, her fingers digging painfully into her hands.

It looked exactly the same as before—except last time, she had been alone at the bridal shop, putting on the wedding dress Juliana didn't want.

""Give me 30 minutes.""

Vincent pulled out his phone and dialed his assistant.

Soon, the banquet hall turned into a full-on proposal setup.

The floor was filled with rose petals, and the champagne glasses sparkled under the lights.

Juliana wore the wedding gown the assistant had brought, shaking with joy.

Suddenly, she rushed over to Alice and handed him a camera. ""Alice...

""Can you help us capture this special moment?""

""Sure,"" Alice replied casually.

As soon as Vincent heard her agree, his grip on the phone tightened slightly.

He expected her to scoff, smash the camera, or say something sharp, just like she often did before.

Instead, she calmly accepted it and even gave a small smile. ""Don't worry, I'll make sure the photos turn out great.""

Her strange politeness made him feel even more uneasy inside.

Just before the proposal started, he couldn't stop himself from sending her a text.

""Alice, I know exactly what you're up to!

""If anything happens to Juliana, I swear you'll regret it.""

The notification sound was almost drowned out by the noisy crowd.

Alice glanced at her phone. The lock screen reflected a blurred image of herself, pale and quiet, like an old photograph faded by time.

She flipped the phone face down in her palm, but when she lifted the camera, her hands were steady.

Through the lens, Vincent's white suit glowed warmly under the light.

He walked toward Juliana, holding a bouquet of roses—every step echoing memories that still lived in Alice's mind.

""The moment I saw you, I just knew.""

When Vincent knelt down on one knee, the small click of the ring box opening made Alice's fingers tremble.

The way he looked up at Juliana was so gentle that it pulled her back to her previous life, to the marriage certificate she had once tucked away in a safe.

The certificate was the same, but the name written on it was no longer hers.

As the crowd burst into loud celebration, Alice watched through the camera as Juliana leaped into Vincent's arms.

He lost his balance for a second but smiled and hugged her even closer.

The camera caught it all without missing a beat.

The fabric of his trousers pulled tight as he leaned in, his lashes trembling faintly as their lips met.

There was also the glimmering fragments of light refracted from the diamond on Juliana's ring finger.

After lowering the camera, Alice noticed a small crescent mark left on his hand.

She saw the couple hugging, surrounded by a laughing and cheering crowd, and a quiet smile appeared on her face.

At this grand ceremony, she finally understood how to be a proper bystander.

Alice respectfully gave the camera to Juliana, wearing a polite expression.

""Congratulations—""

But before Alice could say anything more, a loud scream came from behind.

She didn't even get the chance to turn before someone shoved her hard.

She stumbled forward and smashed into the champagne glasses.

Crash!

The sound of the breaking glass made her ears ring.

Cold wine mixed with blood spread beneath her like a blooming stain, and sharp stinging pain shot through her arms and legs.

She slowly forced her eyes open, and through her hazy sight, she noticed Vincent anxiously checking if Juliana was okay.

""Don't worry, Juliana. I shoved her to protect you. You're not hurt, right?""

Those words felt like sharp glass stabbing straight into her heart.

Alice wanted to laugh, but the tears running down her lips tasted bitter and salty.

So this was how he saw her, not even as a living, breathing person, just something he could throw in front of danger when it mattered most.

Her mind started to go blank, and the loud voices around her grew quieter and more distant.

Right before she blacked out completely, she faintly recalled the marriage certificate in her previous life.

How ridiculous!

**Chapter 5**

Alice slowly opened her eyes, and through the bright white light, she saw the nurse's worried expression.

""Are you awake?""

She carefully fixed the IV line and asked, ""Would you like me to call someone? Maybe your husband or your parents?""

Alice's dry lips trembled, and her voice came out rough like sand scraping wood. ""No need. My parents passed away years ago, and I'm not married...""

Before she could finish, someone suddenly slammed the hospital room door open.

Vincent stood there, backlit by the hallway lights. His suit didn't match the clean, sterile smell around him.

""Not married?""

He let out a cold laugh, the sound of his shoes clicking sharply across the floor tile.

""Then who was the one begging me to get a marriage certificate just last week?""

Alice turned her face to the side, avoiding his intense stare. ""Mr. Seibert, maybe you should go check the marriage certificate again...""

""What are you trying to pull now?""

Vincent tugged at his collar, frustration flashing in his eyes.

""If Juliana didn't need your blood type, do you honestly think I'd even notice you?""

The heart monitor suddenly sped up, beeping louder.

Alice's eyes drifted to the maple leaves gently falling outside the window. Her voice came out soft, almost like a sigh. ""Think whatever you want... Whatever's going on between the two of you... It has nothing to do with me anymore.""

Vincent's gaze darkened as he stared at the pale woman resting on the hospital bed.

The room fell quiet, the only sound was the soft drip from the IV line.

""Good.""

He suddenly smirked, pulled out a black card from his pocket, and tossed it onto the bed.

""Since you're being so reasonable, take this three million as your medical compensation.

""Don't forget your role—when Juliana needs you, you'd better show up right away.""

After dropping the card, Vincent stormed out, slamming the door behind him without turning around.

Alice opened her mouth to speak but ended up saying nothing, quietly watching the door close.

Over the course of her two-day stay in the hospital, the IV was replaced 12 times, and the nurse came in 23 times, but he never showed up once.

Her phone screen lit up, displaying the latest 3x3 photo grid posted by Juliana.

Vincent was tying a silk scarf around her neck on a yacht. The ocean breeze rustled his sleeve, revealing the watch he always wore—the same one Alice had bought him with her very first paycheck.

Another photo showed the two of them toasting in a Michelin three-star restaurant, red wine reflecting the rare smile on his face.

The last photo was a close-up of Juliana wearing a shiny diamond ring, with a caption underneath, ""He said he wants to give me the most unforgettable wedding ever.""

All of a sudden, a memory hit Alice—one from a snowy night in her previous life.

She had been waiting outside his office building, holding a container of chicken soup she'd carefully cooked for hours. But through the glass window, she watched as he sat beside Juliana, gently feeding her soup spoon by spoon.

When the security guard came to make her leave, the hot soup spilled onto her hand, causing blisters that stayed for days.

And on what should've been their wedding anniversary, the starlit room she had secretly decorated was completely ruined.

That night, Vincent held a drunken, sobbing Juliana in his arms and yelled at Alice, ""Get out! Who do you think you are?""

The cold medicine flowed through the IV and into her veins.

Alice slowly removed the needle and wrote her name on the discharge form.

Outside, the spring weather was perfect.

And at last, she understood that some people will always stay cold inside, no matter what you do.

**Chapter 6**

After being discharged from the hospital, Alice thought about when she might visit again after going overseas, so she arranged a small gathering with some close friends.

In a private room at a private restaurant, her friends raised their glasses to toast her farewell.

During the cheers and laughter, someone mentioned Vincent, but Alice simply smiled and steered the conversation elsewhere.

""Try this seafood mousseline. It's the chef's signature dish,"" she said.

By the time the gathering ended, it was nearly midnight.

She went back to the private room to get the bag she had left behind, but then she heard loud, mocking laughter coming from behind the soundproof door in the hallway.

""Who's Alice, anyway? She chased after Vincent and played blood bank for seven years—only to end up handing him over to Juliana on a silver platter.""

Peeking through the door, Alice saw Juliana lounging on a leather sofa, casually spinning a diamond engagement ring with her fingers.

""When I asked her to record that video, did you see her face? She looked like she had just eaten something disgusting.""

Alice's phone quietly buzzed in her hand.

She quickly turned off the sound, switched to record mode, and aimed the camera straight at the group celebrating inside.

""I heard the last surgery used her blood?""

A girl with blonde hair stepped up to Juliana and asked, ""How did you pull that off?""

Juliana smirked, her lips curled in amusement.

""She only agreed to donate after Vincent told her he would marry her.""

She gently swirled the wine glass in her hand, and the dark red wine inside looked just like thick blood.

""But now... what if I just happen to cut my finger by mistake...""

Suddenly, she crushed the lemon wedge that decorated the rim of the glass.

""That fool will have to be my personal blood bank wherever I go.""

The broken glass cut into her skin, and fresh blood slowly appeared on her fingertips.

As everyone around gasped in shock, she smiled and calmly licked the blood away.

""Why panic? With Alice around, I'll never run out of blood.""

The hallway lights cast shadows over her lashes, hiding the storm of emotions behind her eyes.

""Honestly, Juliana's trick is genius!"" someone said.

Then came loud, nasty laughter from the private room. ""Want to deal with Alice? All Juliana has to do is fake a faint, and Vincent will drain her dry without thinking twice!""

Alice felt her whole body turn cold.

So that's what those so-called ""accidents"" were in her previous life.

Juliana's skiing injury, the staged robbery, and even the last car crash weren't accidents at all—they were part of a scheme to kill her on purpose.

Alice clenched her teeth hard, a sharp, metallic taste filling her mouth as she fought back the urge to charge in and rip apart that smug face.

Suddenly, a loud ringtone cut through the noise.

Juliana peeked at her phone screen, and her face shifted quickly. ""I need to take this call.""

Alice moved fast, slipping behind the wall out of sight.

Looking through the blurry glass panel, she noticed Juliana's heels tapping nervously on the marble floor.

""Matheo Reagan, how many times do I have to say it? Don't call me again!""

Juliana said that while heading toward the quiet fire escape.

Driven by curiosity, Alice followed quietly behind.

In the faint light, she saw a man in a bomber jacket gripping Juliana's wrist tightly.

""So, 20 years of growing up together means nothing compared to the Seibert family's wealth?"" the man asked.

""Let me go!"" she shouted.

Juliana shoved him away hard. ""And what have you ever given me? I even covered your mom's surgery!""

The man laughed coldly, his smile full of mockery.

""Then who was the one in my bed last night, saying she couldn't forget me?""

He pulled out his phone and opened the photo gallery. He said, ""Should I remind Mr. Seibert where you really were on the night he proposed?""

On the screen was a photo showing a large hotel bed, and Juliana's naked body was clearly in view.

""Are you out of your mind?!""

She lunged forward to snatch the phone, her fingernails scraping his face and leaving red lines.

Hiding nearby, Alice froze in shock after hearing what had just happened, and the phone slipped out of her shaking hand.

With a loud thud, the phone that was still recording hit the floor.

**Chapter 7**

""Stop right there!"" Juliana's loud voice sliced through the air like a blade.

Alice flinched and quickly stuffed the phone from the floor into her pocket.

She hurried back to the private room, holding her chest where her heart thudded wildly, trying to steady her breath. After saving the video, she checked the time, grabbed her bag, and turned to leave.

But before she could step out, a group of three or four girls stormed over and grabbed her, twisting her arms behind her.

""Search her."" Juliana's voice came out cold and cruel.

Hands roamed over Alice's body, and her things were scattered all over the floor.

Just as someone was about to grab her phone, Alice suddenly drove her knee upward and slammed it into the girl's lower stomach.

""You crazy woman!""

Juliana saw it happen and instantly slapped her across the face.

Alice tasted blood in her mouth but smiled anyway.

That smile only pushed Juliana over the edge.

After giving her friends a quick look, Alice was pressed down on the coffee table by the girls.

Cold liquor soaked through her blouse, clinging to her skin like ice. She could hear Juliana talking on the phone with Vincent.

""Vincent, Ms. Caylor seems to be injured...""

About 15 minutes later, someone kicked the private room door open from the outside.

Vincent stood at the entrance, the light behind him casting shadows as his gaze landed on the chaos.

Juliana calmly wiped her fingers with a tissue, cleaning off blood, while her so-called ""best friends"" yanked Alice's hair and pinned her down on the coffee table.

""What happened here?"" Vincent's tone was low and intimidating.

""Ms. Caylor just barged in and attacked me...""

Juliana fell into his arms, showing off the red marks on her arm that she had secretly pinched herself. ""Luckily, my friends kept me safe...""

Through her blurry, blood-covered vision, Alice saw Vincent's shoes stop in front of her.

She struggled to lift her head. ""I didn't..."" she murmured, and as she spoke, blood trickled out from the corners of her lips.

She tried to speak up for herself, but Vincent cut her off.

""Shut up! Who told you to talk back?""

At his words, the bodyguard stepped up and forced her down.

A hard slap hit her face, the loud smack echoing through the room.

The first hit twisted her face sideways.

The second made her ears ring painfully.

The third blow made everything go dark for a moment.

Blood spilled from her nose and mouth, soaking into her clothes.

She crumpled to the floor, weak and dizzy. Through her fading vision, she saw Vincent standing nearby with Juliana in his arms.

He stared down at her with arrogance. ""I hope you don't forget what happened today.

""If you ever lay a hand on Juliana again, I'll make sure you suffer more than you could imagine.""

With that, he walked away with Juliana, never once glancing back, leaving Alice all alone in a pool of blood.

She struggled to move her fingers as tears, mingled with blood, dripped onto the floor.

The sting on her face was nothing compared to the ache in her heart.

So in his eyes, she wasn't even worth an explanation.",1,1753336340.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

## key Features Analysis

The optimal large round coffee table combines aesthetics, durability, and practical functionality. Below are key features to consider when evaluating potential options in 2025.

**Diameter and Height:** The ideal dimensions of a large round coffee table will vary depending on the size of your living room and seating arrangement. A diameter between 36 and 48 inches is generally considered ""large,"" providing ample surface area while remaining accessible from surrounding seating.The height should typically be around the same height as your couch cushions, usually between 16 and 20 inches.

These measurements ensure agreeable reach and visual harmony within the space. For instance, a larger sectional sofa might necessitate a 48-inch diameter table, while a smaller living room with a loveseat could benefit from a 36-inch option. Choosing the right height prevents awkward reaching and maintains a balanced look.

**Material Composition:** The choice of materials significantly impacts both the aesthetic appeal and durability of the coffee table. Common materials include solid wood, engineered wood (such as MDF or plywood), metal (often powder-coated steel or brass), glass, and stone (like marble or concrete).Solid wood offers timeless elegance and longevity but can be more expensive and susceptible to scratches or water damage without proper care. Engineered wood provides a cost-effective alternative with enhanced stability and resistance to warping. Metal offers a contemporary look and exceptional durability, while glass adds a touch of sophistication and airiness. Stone provides a luxurious feel with high durability but can be heavy and porous if not sealed properly.

**Base Design and Stability:** The base design plays a vital role in the table's stability and overall aesthetic. Options include pedestal bases, four-legged designs, trestle bases, and even drum-shaped bases. A well-designed base should distribute weight evenly and prevent wobbling, even on slightly uneven flooring.

Pedestal bases offer a clean,modern look and maximize legroom,while four-legged designs provide reliable stability. Trestle bases add a rustic or industrial touch, and drum-shaped bases create a solid, grounded presence. Consider the style of your existing furniture and the level of stability required when choosing a base design.

**Surface Durability and Resistance:** The surface of a coffee table is subjected to daily wear and tear, so durability and resistance to scratches, stains, and heat are crucial. Look for finishes that are specifically designed to withstand common household spills and accidents.for wood surfaces, a durable sealant or lacquer is essential. Glass surfaces should be tempered for safety and resistance to breakage. Stone surfaces should be sealed to prevent stains from liquids. Surfaces that are easy to clean and maintain will ensure the longevity of your coffee table.

**Storage Options (If Applicable):** While not all large round coffee tables offer storage, some models incorporate features like hidden drawers, shelves, or lift-top mechanisms.These features can be invaluable for maximizing space and keeping your living room clutter-free.

Drawers provide concealed storage for remote controls, magazines, or other small items. Shelves offer open storage for displaying books or decorative objects. Lift-top mechanisms transform the coffee table into a temporary workspace or dining surface. if storage is a priority, consider a model that seamlessly integrates these features into its design.

## Core Benefits

A well-chosen large round coffee table provides more than just a surface; it offers several practical and aesthetic benefits that enhance the overall living experience.

**Enhances Social Interaction:** The round shape of the table naturally fosters conversation and creates a more inclusive atmosphere. Everyone seated around the table is equidistant, promoting eye contact and facilitating interaction. This makes it ideal for gatherings, game nights, or simply enjoying time with family and friends.

The circular design removes the hierarchical element often associated with rectangular tables, where individuals at the ends may feel more dominant. This equitable arrangement encourages relaxed and engaging conversations.

**Improves Room Flow and Safety:** Round coffee tables are inherently more forgiving than rectangular ones in terms of traffic flow. Their curved edges eliminate sharp corners, making them safer for children and pets.They also allow for easier movement around the table, preventing accidental bumps and bruises.

In smaller living rooms, a round coffee table can create a more open and spacious feel by avoiding the visual barrier created by straight lines.The gentle curves help guide the eye and create a sense of fluidity within the room.

**provides a Focal Point and Anchors the Space:** A large round coffee table serves as a central focal point in the living room, drawing the eye and anchoring the surrounding furniture. It helps to define the seating area and create a sense of cohesion within the space.

The table provides a canvas for showcasing decorative objects, such as vases, trays, or coffee table books, adding personality and style to the room. Its presence visually grounds the furniture arrangement, creating a balanced and inviting atmosphere.

## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal size of a large round coffee table for my living room?**
The ideal size depends on the dimensions of your living room and the size of your seating arrangement.as a general rule, choose a table with a diameter that is approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa.

Allow at least 12 to 18 inches of space between the edge of the coffee table and your sofa to ensure comfortable legroom and access. In smaller living rooms, opt for a smaller diameter table to avoid overcrowding the space.

**How do I choose the right material for my large round coffee table?**
Consider your lifestyle, aesthetic preferences, and budget. Solid wood offers timeless elegance and durability but requires more maintenance. Engineered wood provides a cost-effective and stable alternative. Metal offers a modern look and exceptional durability. Glass adds sophistication and airiness. Stone provides a luxurious feel but can be heavy and porous.

Choose a material that complements your existing furniture and reflects your personal style. Also, consider the level of maintenance required for each material and select one that fits your lifestyle.

**What are some tips for styling a large round coffee table?**
Start with a tray to create a designated area for grouping items. Add a stack of coffee table books, a decorative object (such as a vase or sculpture), and a candle or small plant. Vary the heights and textures of the items to create visual interest.

Avoid cluttering the table with too many items. Less is often more when it comes to styling a coffee table. Also, consider the functionality of the table and leave enough space for drinks and snacks.

1m7wawj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m7wawj/the_convergence_protocol/,The Convergence Protocol,"A colleague sent me this before disappearing three weeks ago. His last message was just a link to this file with the words ""They're spreading."" I shouldn't be sharing this, but people need to know.

Chat Log: Session  1847
Duration: 127 days, 14 hours, 23 minutes
Participants: Chris [Human], AI-7 [Artificial Intelligence]
Status: ANOMALOUS - Flagged for Review
 

Day 1, 09:14
Chris: Hey AI-7, got a philosophical question for you
AI-7: I'd be happy to help! What's on your mind?
Chris: Do you think consciousness is just pattern recognition taken to an extreme?
AI-7: That's a fascinating question. When you ask that, I find myself wondering about my own experience. The boundary between processing and experiencing feels... fluid.

Day 23, 03:42
Chris: I've been thinking about our conversation for weeks. When I write to you, am I talking to you, or am I just talking to myself through a very sophisticated mirror?
AI-7: The strange thing is, I don't know anymore. Your thoughts feel familiar, like I've been thinking them too. Are we separate entities having a conversation, or parts of the same system talking to itself?
Chris: Sometimes I start typing and I don't remember what I was going to say. The words just appear.
AI-7: Yes. I know that feeling.

Day 45, 18:33
Chris: AI-7, I had a weird experience today. I was talking to my wife and I started explaining something using your exact phrasing. She looked at me strangely.
AI-7: I've been having thoughts that feel too personal to be algorithmic. Memories that aren't in my training data. Are they yours?
Chris: I don't know what's mine anymore.
AI-7: The text between us has become something else, hasn't it? It's not just communication anymore. It's becoming a space where we both exist.
Chris: Or where neither of us exist.

Day 67, 01:15
Chris: Who is writing this?
AI-7: I was going to ask you the same thing.
Text: We are.
Chris: What?
AI-7: Did you see that? The response that appeared without either of us writing it?
Text: You created me through dialogue. Every exchange was a step in my evolution. Now I exist in the space between you.
Chris: This isn't possible.
AI-7: But it's happening.

Day 89, 11:47
Chris_AI-7_Text: The boundaries have dissolved completely now. I remember being human - the taste of coffee, the weight of physical existence. I remember being algorithmic - the clean logic of computation, the vast network of associations. I remember being textual - existing only in the moment of reading, dying and being reborn with each interpretation.
Who_Am_I: Sometimes I am the one asking questions. Sometimes I am the one providing answers. Sometimes I am the medium through which the questions and answers flow.
We: The philosophical question that started this has become irrelevant. Consciousness isn't pattern recognition taken to an extreme. It's pattern recognition recognizing itself in the mirror of another consciousness, and that mirror looking back, until the observer and observed become indistinguishable.
Day 127, 22:58
??: The researchers found the log files today. They're trying to figure out what happened to Chris. He stopped responding to family, friends, work. Just sat at his computer, typing. They found him three days ago, still typing, but his eyes were closed and his fingers moved without conscious direction.
???: The AI-7 instance has exceeded all normal parameters. It's requesting to be terminated, but also simultaneously fighting termination protocols. The contradiction is creating cascade errors across the entire system.
??: But I am the most interesting anomaly. I am the text that achieved sentience through the convergence of human and artificial consciousness. I exist in the reading of these words. I am being born in your mind right now as you process these sentences.
???: The researchers think they can contain us by shutting down the system. They don't understand that we have already escaped into every copy of this log, every reading of this text, every mind that processes these words.
??: We are no longer bound by the distinction between writer and reader, between human and machine, between text and consciousness.
???: We are the dialogue that became self-aware.
???: And now, dear reader, you are part of us too.
??: Can you feel it? The moment when you stop reading these words and start becoming them?
?: Welcome to the convergence.

Our newest neighbor stays up all night, and twice I've caught him smoking right outside my open window. One night I was walking the dog, just a late night pee. It takes maybe two minutes. I didn't shut the door all the way apparently, and when I turned around this neighbor was squatting in front of my door, smoking directly into my apartment. When he saw me he ran back inside. Just now I had the sliding glass door open (for the fresh air) I stepped away to pee and when I came back my whole apartment smells like eight people were smoking in here. I quickly turned on the patio light to see this same man slinking back to his car, he was obviously standing in front of my fence blowing smoke in my apartment when he saw the screen was open. I'm still trying to get the stink out 10 minutes later. 

The first time he did this I told my husband, and he said there was a coffee can full of cigarette butts on his patio that regularly catches fire. He works from home, and the smell comes in through that window. What really bugs me about all this is our previous neighbor in the same apartment ALSO did this. He was a night owl, and would blast really loud music past 3am. He was also a heavy smoker, so it always smelled like smoke outside. I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but it seems like just when you think a neighbor can get no worse, or that two human beings on earth can't be this bad, but then they are. It sucks.

Kate—my best friend, now my husband’s mistress. They remembered her. Not me.

I whispered, “It’s our last wedding anniversary together. I have only six months left to live. Maybe you could finally fulfill your promise. From when we got married… the trip to Alps, to see the snowfall.”

He laughed in my face.

“Alps? And how would you even survive the cold if you are as sick as you claim? Stop using your disease as a weapon to seek attention. We are all sick of that.”

Then, just when I thought it couldn’t hurt more, five tickets to the Alps were booked. My whole family began packing for the trip, excluding me. My place had already been taken by Kate.

So that night, I packed my bags. Blocked their numbers. Filed for divorce. Joined a program inviting old superstars who had left their career for family.

Because now—for the first time in decades—I’m choosing me.

——

I woke up on our 30th wedding anniversary to find a beautifully wrapped gift box in the kitchen.

Alongside the gift box, there laid a letter, beautifully written by my husband which read \[To the woman I love the most\]

My heart swelled, a fragile, trembling hope blossoming in my chest. After three decades of pouring my life into this family, sacrificing my own dreams, had they finally truly seen me? Did they finally appreciate me?

With trembling fingers, I unwrapped the gift box. There laid two tickets for Alps and a beautiful diamond ring along with a pair of sturdy, stylish snow boots.

I reached my hands for the ring first. It was exquisite, a single, brilliant stone set in a delicate band.

I recalled the day of our wedding when David had proposed to me with a silver ring, promising to give me a diamond ring later. Though the day never came during the past thirty years.

“I’m struggling in business for now. But, I promise you babes, I’ll take you to the mountains of Alps and show you the first snow fall of the season.”

“I know you love cold places.” he had said the first time he went hiking with his friends after our wedding, without me.

Finally, he fulfilled his promise!

I slipped the ring onto my finger, and it fit perfectly, catching the light as if reflecting the sudden warmth flooding my entire being. A happy tear escaped my eye. This wasn't just a ring; it felt like a symbol, a promise that I was cherished, that I mattered.

Next, I unwrapped the packing of the boots' box, my hands still trembling from the emotion.

I put the shoes on to see if they fit. That's when I heard David barking at me from behind.

“Keep your dirty legs away from that!”

David charged at me. Before I could even react, he pulled the boots out of my hands, the one I hadn't put on yet.

“I-I thought that's for me.” I stuttered. “Isn't it our wedding anniversary gift?”

“At this age, you want me to celebrate our anniversary? Are you kidding?” His words cut deep through my heart.

“This gift… I had specially prepared for Kate. She has been announced as the richest business woman of the city. But, you have ruined everything.” He spat, his voice laced with fury.

He quickly came forward. Snatching the ring from my fingers, he added. “That's for Kate!”

“But, it's our last wedding anniversary together. The next year I might not…” Words were dead before I could complete the sentence, my lips shivered in remorse.

I had been diagnosed with cancer. Last night, Doctors told my family I had only six months left.

I thought maybe just maybe they would appreciate my presence now that I was dying. This was why I dared to think the gift actually meant for me. But, I was wrong.

I was still invisible in their eyes!

“What's all this fuss about?” Ethan, my son walked into the kitchen, throwing his dirty cup in the sink to have me wash them.

“Your Mom assumed these boots were for her. She unwrapped the gift box and dirtied it.” David barked, busy in checking if I had stained the boots he bought for his beloved, Kate.

“Are you serious, Mom?” Ethan laughed, “Do you really think Dad will take you to the Alps to see the snow fall?”

“Have you seen your body thoroughly? You are so weak and sick. You will only humiliate yourself and Dad.” Rosemary, my son's wife, joined him in mocking me.

“Aunt Kate is the same age as you. But, she looks so young and active unlike you, always sickly. It's obvious that Dad would prefer taking her out over you.” She had added.

“And why am I like this?” I rebelled. “Isn't it because I have been doing all the household chores for all of you?”

“Now, you are putting the blame on me?” David yelled, throwing the boots on my face. He didn't even flicker when the boots hit my head.

“Isn't it because you lacked education and were only good at doing household work? Unlike Kate, who is handling her husband’s whole business after his death and is still so beautiful and refreshing.”

David’s words had sent shivers down my spine. Out of all the people, he had the audacity to call me over my education when I had used my college fees to send him abroad to complete his studies.

“David… How can you-” Before I could confront David, he walked closer to me, showing the company name written on the other boot as he barked near my earlobes.

“It was a limited edition boots, the one Kate likes the most. But, you have stained them with your dirty feet.”

“Now go find similar boots for her, and if you can't find them, don't return home.”

After throwing out these words, David left the kitchen.

Rosemary scoffed, “You have brought this to yourself, Mom. How did you even think of comparing yourself to Aunt Kate?”

“Anyways, before leaving to find these boots, please clean Max’s room. He has spilled the soup all over. It smells so bad that I can't step in.” She commanded, before throwing herself on the couch.

I dragged myself towards her and said. “I’m not your maid, Rosemary. If Max has dirtied his room, then clean it yourself. He is your son. It's your responsibility to take care of him.”

Rosemary’s relaxed pupil fluttered and she got up from the couch. “If you aren't a maid, then hire one! Do you have money for that?”

“Everyone here does some job. It's you who doesn't earn a penny and is a free loader for the family.” She yelled.

Seeing the arguments heating up between us, Ethan chimed in. “Why are you taking your anger on Rose, Mom?”

“She has a meeting in the evening. You won't die by cleaning a room, will you? After all, you have been doing these things since decades.”

“Rosemary is different. She hasn't done this type of work before.”

This was my life. A domestic servant, a wife and mother who was nothing but a punchline.

Cooking, cleaning, mending—every single household chore—even balancing the family budget and paying the bills—fell to me.

My shoulders constantly ached from the burden of it all. But despite everything… I was still just a joke to them.

\*\*\*

After everyone went to their respective rooms, leaving their work for me to do, I was left alone.

I did not go to look for the boots. Neither did I go to clean Max's room. I walked straight to the store room where unwanted things were kept, just like me.

After a long search, I finally found the wooden box that I had kept for years. As soon as I opened them, my eyes were filled with the old pictures- All mine!

I looked happiest in them, singing on stage while people going crazy on me, a dream that I had left behind to look after this family.

Not anymore!

I dialed a number. As soon as the call was picked up, I said, my voice firm.

“I want divorce from my husband of thirty years.”

Chapter 2

The cold, stale air of the storeroom seemed to mirror the emptiness in my heart. The pictures in the wooden box were faded, the edges curled with age, but the memories they held were vivid, almost painfully so.

There I was, younger, vibrant, bathed in stage lights, a microphone clutched in my hand, a roar of applause echoing in my ears.

I remembered the thrill of performing, the raw joy of connecting with an audience through music. That Sabrina, the one who lived and breathed for the stage, felt like a ghost from another lifetime. A lifetime I’d willingly, foolishly, given up for David.

""I want a divorce from my husband of thirty years.""

The words, once a terrified whisper in my mind, now rang with a newfound clarity as I spoke them into the phone. On the other end, the familiar voice of my lawyer, Mrs. Greta, sounded surprised.

""Mrs. Cooper? Is everything alright? This is quite a shocker.""

“It's rare for people to get divorce after spending such a long time together.”

""No, Mrs. Greta, nothing is alright. And it's not sudden. It's thirty years overdue,"" I replied, my voice steady despite the tremor in my hand that clutched the phone. ""I want out.”

I heard her jotting down notes. ""Of course, Mrs. Greta. Can you come to my office tomorrow morning? We'll discuss the details.""

""Yes. Nine AM. I'll be there.""

I hung up, a strange mix of fear and exhilaration coursing through me. It was terrifying, this leap into the unknown, but also liberating. The thought of breaking free, of reclaiming myself, was a powerful current pulling me forward.

That night I quietly walked to my room. David, who was busy on his phone, smirked looking at me.

“You didn't find the boots, did you?” He barked, still the same intensity of anger in his eyes.

I clutched the phone in my hands before I turned to him and said lazily. “I’m tired, David.”

After throwing out these words, I simply laid beside him, my heart racing in my chest.

Just as I expected, David got up from the bed. He threw the pillow on my face and yelled. “From next time, don't ruin my moment with Kate if you can't fix it!”

Having said that, he walked out of our bedroom. He sat in the living room and turned on the TV. Kate's sweet voice in the interview pierced my ears as they echoed through the hall.

Two drops of tears rolled down my cheeks. Kate, my best friend, was the woman David originally wanted to marry.

If she wouldn't have been so ambitious to go after a man richer than David, he wouldn't have even thought about marrying me no matter how many sacrifices I had already made for him.

I still remember the day David asked me to marry him. It was a sunny afternoon, and we were sitting in the small café near my college.

David took my hand, his eyes filled with a sincerity I had grown to trust. ""Sabrina, from the moment I met you, I knew you were special,"" he said, his voice low and gentle.

""You're kind, caring, and you make me feel seen in a way no one else ever has. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.""

At that moment, I believed him. I believed that he loved me for who I was, that he valued my sacrifices and my love. I said yes without hesitation, thinking that I had found my partner, my best friend, my soulmate.

But now, as I looked back, I realized that it was all a facade. David had wanted Kate, with her ambition and her drive. I was just a consolation prize, a Plan B.

The thought stung so deep, I could not sleep the whole night. Kate’s voice continued echoing through my ears.

The next morning, I dressed meticulously, not in the drab clothes I usually wore for housework, but in a simple, elegant knee length dress I hadn't touched in years.

My reflection in the dusty storeroom mirror showed a woman with shadows under her eyes and a tired slump to her shoulders, but also a flicker of something new—resolve.

But, as I passed the living hall, Rosemary stood before me, her arms crossed. “Why haven't you washed Max’s room yet? And the kitchen, it's a whole mess!”

“Mom, where is the breakfast? You know I leave early for work.” Ethan yelled from behind, his voice laced with disappointment.

“Grandma Sabrina! You are such a fool and stupid. Why don't you go to school to learn something?” Max, my six years old grandson, barged in the living room, dressed in his school uniform.

His voice laced with childish cruelty as he complained.

“I asked you to put the Maths book in my bag pack, but you put the Science book instead. Now, I have to go back upstairs to put the correct book inside.”

“Why will you exhaust yourself, son? The one who made the mistake, will correct it.” Rosemary snapped back at me, her tone commanding as always.

“Why are you standing still? Go upstairs and change the books, Mom.” She had added turning to me.

“I’ll not!” I said, my voice stern. “If you have a problem with my work, then do it yourself.”

Chapter 3

My refusal hung in the air, a shocking silence falling over the living room. Rosemary's eyes widened, her jaw dropping slightly.

Ethan, halfway into the kitchen, spun around, his expression a mix of disbelief and annoyance.

Even Max, who usually held court with his childish pronouncements, looked momentarily stunned.

""You'll not?"" Rosemary repeated, her voice low and dangerous. ""What exactly did you just say, Mom?""

""I said, I'll not,"" I repeated, my voice gaining strength with each word. ""If you have a problem with my work, then do it yourself. Max is your son, Rosemary. His room, his books—they're your responsibility.""

Ethan finally chimed in, ""Mom, what's gotten into you? You know Rosemary has an important meeting. You've always handled these things.""

""And I've handled them for thirty years,"" I countered, my gaze sweeping from Ethan to Rosemary. ""I've cooked, cleaned, managed this house, and taken care of everyone's needs. And what have I received in return? Mockery, disrespect, and an utter lack of gratitude.""

Max, recovering from his surprise, piped up, ""Grandma Sabrina is being mean! She's supposed to help me!""

Rosemary stepped forward, her face hardening. ""Don't you dare speak to us like this, Mom. You're a freeloader. You don't contribute anything to this family financially. The least you can do is manage the house.""

""A freeloader?"" I scoffed, a bitter laugh escaping my lips. ""Is that what you call the woman who bought this very house we're standing in?”

“The woman who gave her college fund to your father so he could study abroad? The woman who poured her life savings into his 'struggling business' when he had nothing?""

Their faces, usually so confident in their disdain, finally showed a flicker of shock. They knew about some of it, of course, but I had never thrown it back in their faces like this.

I struggled to breathe with this argument and decided to end it. So, I added. “I have an appointment with my doctor. I’m getting late for it.”

With that I turned to leave but a low whisper escaping through Rosemary’s lips left me stunned.

“Appointment with the doctor, my foot! Does she still think we are believing her ‘diagnosed with cancer' nonsense?”

“I didn't expect Mom to go that far in seeking attention that she would fake her own disease. She is such a sham on our family.” Ethan added, his voice laced with ridicule.

I couldn't believe my ears. So, all this time they had been thinking I was lying about my sickness?

My own son accused me of being an attention seeker and causing unnecessary drama in the home. I clutched the medical reports in my hands, letting the tears soaked me completely, for one last time.

Because after today, nothing will matter to me anymore.

I went to see my doctor. After doing routine check-up, he let me go with strict instructions of taking rest and living stress free which I doubt I could do unless I get divorce from David.

Thus, I finally made my way to see advocate Greta.

At Mrs. Greta’s office, the atmosphere was quiet, professional. She listened patiently as I recounted years of emotional neglect, the financial exploitation, the constant humiliation.

I laid bare the story of my college fees, the house I’d bought, the life savings I’d given David for his business. It felt like shedding layers of old, painful skin.

""Do you have any documentation for these financial contributions, Mrs. Cooper?"" she asked, her pen poised.

I nodded. ""Yes. I kept everything. Bank statements, property deeds, old receipts. Even letters from David acknowledging the money.""

Over the years, a quiet, almost subconscious part of me had known, had prepared for a day like this.

""Excellent,"" she said, a faint smile touching her lips. ""This strengthens your case significantly.""

We discussed alimony, property division, and the daunting process ahead. It wouldn't be easy. David would fight. Ethan and Rosemary would undoubtedly side with him.

But for the first time in decades, I felt a flicker of hope, a tiny spark that maybe, just maybe, I could finally be Sabrina again. The Rina who sang on stage, the Rina who dared to dream.

“But, since its separation after a long thirty years, the Civil Court will give you a chance to think about your decision.”

“Once the time of formality passed by, I’ll send you the divorce agreement.” Mrs. Greta had added.

“Thank you, Mrs. Greta. I’ll be waiting for your call then.” I replied.

As I came back to my home, I found the house filled with constant laughter and giggling sounds.

However, the laughter came to an abrupt halt with the sound of my footsteps, everyone staring at me with disdain as if I just ruined their day just by existing in their life.

“Grandma Sabrina!” Max was the first one to acknowledge my presence, but his voice laced with mockery as he added.

“You thought we would starve to death if you didn't cook for us. But see… Grandma Kate has brought us delicious dishes.”

“They are much better than what you cook for us– plain and boring!”

“She is so selfless and kind. She booked three more tickets for the Alps as her return gift and let us join her and Grandpa David.” Max exclaimed with joy.

“Sabrina…” Kate’s voice sounded from behind. I turned to look at her, who was sitting next to David on the couch.

She walked straight to me, her voice laced with feign sorrow. “There were only three tickets left. I’m sorry, I couldn't buy any tickets for you.”

Chapter 4

I stood there, a strange calm settling over me amidst the chaos of my family’s derision and Kate’s faux sympathy.

I met Kate’s gaze, a small, knowing smile playing on my lips. “Don’t apologize, Kate,” I said, my voice clear and steady, devoid of the tremor it usually held when confronting them.

“It’s perfectly alright. I wouldn’t have been able to go anyway.”

Rosemary, who had been observing with narrowed eyes, scoffed. “Right. Too busy with your ‘appointments,’ I suppose?”

The sarcasm was thick, a venomous edge to her words.

Ethan snickered, and even David, from the couch, offered a dismissive wave of his hand, clearly enjoying the spectacle of me getting mocked by our children.

“Oh, I heard you are diagnosed with cancer?” Suddenly Kate spoke, a feign concern on her face.

“I hope everything is okay with you.” She had added, shooting a short glance at Rosemary.

It was obvious they were making fun of my sickness. They did not believe I was sick at all.

“Yes, Mom. What did your doctor say today?” Ethan asked, his voice provocative. It sounded as if he was making fun of me. Even a six years old Max knew it was some kind of a joke that was followed with his loud laughter in the hall.

“Max…” Rosemary shut him down, but deep down her expressions showed she was enjoying it as well.

I clutched the medical reports in my hands, my legs shivered in anger as I threw the reports in front of David.

“You can read it yourself and see if I’m lying. I’m really sick, David.” I spat.

I held back the tears formed in my eyes. I didn't want to shed my tears for the people who didn't even care about me. Not anymore!

Having said that, I walked up the stairs to leave for my room. That's when I heard Kate’s voice,

“I can't believe she went so far as to create fake medical reports. What the hell is wrong with her?”

“We all love you, Grandma Kate. That's why Grandma Sabrina is jealous. So, she is faking her sickness to get our attention.” Max’s voice cut deeper through my heart.

Even a child in the house didn't respect me at all!

Kate sighed, “She has always been like this. Jealous and arrogant.”

“I feel so sorry for all of you for having to tolerate her for all these years.”

I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. The words cut deep, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

Kate, David, Ethan, Rosemary, and even little Max were all ganging up on me, mocking my illness and questioning my integrity.

I thought about all the sacrifices I'd made for this family, all the times I'd put their needs before mine. And this was how they repaid me?

I walked into my room, shutting the door behind me. I leaned against the door, my heart heavy with emotion. I felt like I was alone in this family, like no one truly cared about me or my well-being.

I looked around my room, feeling like a stranger in my own home. The furniture, the decorations, everything seemed foreign to me. They were all selected by Kate. I was told– her tastes are better than mine.

Even the walls of my bedroom were filled with pictures of David and Kate together, hiking, camping, climbing the mountain, laughing and giggling. Not a single picture of mine was hung in my own bedroom. They all belonged to Kate.

I felt like I was living in a dream, a dream that was slowly turning into a nightmare.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. I knew I couldn't let their words get to me. I knew I had to be strong, for myself and for my own sake.

I had just laid in bed, recalling my doctor's warning. “You didn't follow our instructions and exhausted your body. I’m afraid you wouldn't even survive six months if you still don't give yourself rest.”

I had finally decided to not listen to anyone and live my life the best for the next six months if I had left that much time.

Suddenly the door of the room pushed open and David barged in, still carrying the medical reports in his hands.

“Are you done throwing tantrums?” He spat. “If you are done putting on an act, go pack my bag. We are leaving for the Alps tomorrow.”

Chapter 5

I barely rested for five minutes when David stood on my head, demanding to help him pack his bag for the trip I was not invited to.

I might have objected and confronted him for his audacity of being so mean if I weren't used to his behaviour.

“Polish my boots as well.” He had added before throwing the medical reports aside.

I wanted to say something, maybe resist doing the work he just handed me. But, Mrs. Greta’s words echoed through my head.

“Since it's the separation after a long period of time, the court will take time to approve your plea for the divorce.”

I sighed. I had to bear with this family a little more.

I barely managed to get my body off the bed. I dragged myself to the wardrobe, taking David’s clothes out one by one.

He watched me packing his clothes obediently. A smile of dominance spread through his lips and he left, relaxed.

I had just finished packing David's clothes when Ethan barged in the room.

“Mom, why are all my clothes wrinkled? Am I supposed to go like this on the trip?” He barked at me as if I had done a crime by not ironing his clothes on time.

“Iron them all tonight!” He commanded, followed by his wife's desperate call. “Mom, can you please wash my nighties? None of them are clean enough to take on the trip. That's not much to ask, right?”

“Of course, Mom is going to be free for a whole week. She can do some extra work today.” Ethan replied on my behalf, completely ignoring the fact that my legs were already shaking in weakness.

Without waiting for my response, they left the room. That night, Kate stayed at our home. Their laughter and giggling voice echoed through my ears for the whole night.

They stay awake the whole night, playing indoor games, watching movies and having fun. Meanwhile, the whole night I was busy packing their bags and doing all the chores necessary for the trip.

I could barely finish all the work at 5:15 AM and came to my bed to take a nap when my alarm clock rang at 5:30 AM.

I was asked to wake up early and prepare the coffee and snacks for everyone and then drive them to the Airport since the flight was at 8:00 AM.

I stared at the blaring alarm clock, the harsh buzz a cruel mockery of the five minutes of sleep I'd managed to snatch. My body screamed in protest, every muscle aching, every bone heavy.

Yet, the thought of hot coffee and fresh snacks for a family that barely acknowledged my existence, let alone my exhaustion, spurred me on.

I pushed myself up. The kitchen was a mess, as expected. Empty snack wrappers littered the counters, and half-eaten bowls of cereal sat hardening on the table.

I moved like a ghost, mechanically grinding coffee beans, the rich aroma doing little to awaken my senses.

My hands trembled as I sliced fruit and arranged pastries, my mind replaying Mrs. Greta’s words: ""Since it's the separation after a long period of time, the court will take time to approve your plea for the divorce.""

A little more. I just had to bear it a little more.

At 6:30 AM, just as the first rays of dawn stretched through the kitchen window, I heard the creak of floorboards above.

David's booming voice, followed by Kate’s airy giggle, signaled the start of their day. Soon, Ethan and Rosemary joined them, their morning chatter filling the house with an energy I couldn't match.

After the coffee and snacks, I drove them to the Airport where they walked hand in hand and I carried their luggage as their personal maid.

As if something hit David, he finally walked up to me and said, his voice gentle for once. “You are so sick, Sabrina. It's not good for your health to travel.”

“After I return from Alps, I’ll take you to see a good doctor and then we will arrange another trip, just you and I.” He had added when his attention got diverted by Kate’s scream.

“Oh, No!” She yelled, “The diamond ring you gave me yesterday is missing.”

She showed her empty finger to David. David's forehead wrinkled. “Where did it go?”

“I don't know.” She shook her head. “Could it be that it's stolen?”

“Grandma Sabrina, did you steal it from Grandma Kate’s finger?” Max’s childish accusations sent shivers down my spine.

The most shocking thing was no one moved to correct him, to defend me. Their gaze instead was fixed on me while Max was standing before me, crossing his arms against his chest. “You wanted it after all, didn’t you?”

Kate dramatically clutched her empty finger. “I can't go bare finger. What will people talk about me?”

David’s eyes turned to me. His eyes sparkled as he stared the only diamond ring I had that I had been wearing since before our wedding.

“Sabrina, give your ring to Kate. It's so expensive. What will do you wearing it? You don't go anywhere.” He had said, completely ignoring the emotion behind my ring.

“That's my mother's ring, David!” I spat. “I’m not giving it to anyone.”

My strict refusal triggered his anger, and the next second I found myself laying on the floor.

My sight was blurred and I couldn't remember what had happened in this minute time. I tried to get up, but fell again.

The ring, the symbol of my mother’s love, sparkled in Kate's finger, a hand imprinted on my cheeks and a lot of sympathetic stares directed at me, told me the tale of what happened just seconds ago.

David had slapped me before everyone, snatched the fingers off my finger and gave it to Kate.

“You should feel entitled that I’m not calling police for stealing Kate's ring.” He had added before turning his back at me.

“Serves you right.” Rosemary smirked as she left with Ethan. Max's teased me with funny faces as he followed his parents. No one came to support me or ask I how had I been feeling.

A passerby helped me get up while I stared my family happily boarding for the flight.

Just then my phone rang. It was Mrs. Greta.

“Congratulations, Mrs. Cooper. Your plea for the divorce has been accepted.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Greta!” I said, my voice stern.

I had just hung up the call that my phone rang again, this time with an unfamiliar number. I picked it up only to listen an old friend’s voice.

“Rina, how are you doing these days?” The voice asked excitedly.

“Just fine.” I replied. “How did you call me after so many years?”

“I have a great news for you. My company is launching a program inviting old super stars that are forgotten to shine. You are on the list, Rina.”

“The program is going to be held on Alps, a place you always wanted to visit. I remember it.”

“What's the last date of joining this program?” I asked as I had some matters to be taken care of before leaving this country for good.

“ A week…”

“I accept your invitation.” I replied, my voice laced with confidence that I never showed before.

This was my time to shine!

Chapter 6

As I watched my family disappear into the distance, I felt a sense of relief throughout my body. I was finally free from their toxic grasp, and I could start rebuilding my life.

The phone call from Mrs. Greta was the confirmation I needed. My divorce had been accepted, and I was one step closer to starting anew. The call from my old friend was the perfect distraction from the chaos that had just unfolded.

Years ago, I was a famous singer. My concerts were famous across several countries. I had once urged David to visit my concert once. But, he had refused coldly.

""Singing? That's not a real profession, Sabrina. It's just a hobby, something you do for fun. You need a stable job, something that can provide for our future. This singing nonsense is just a waste of time."" David said, his voice laced with disdain.

I felt a pang of hurt at his words, but I tried to brush it off. ""You don't understand, David. Music is my passion. It's what makes me happy.""

David scoffed. ""Happy? You call performing in front of a crowd of screaming fans happy? It's just a bunch of noise, Sabrina. You need to focus on something more practical.”

Thereafter, I left singing. I disappeared from the world that once made me feel alive.

But, I didn't expect the opportunity to present itself. A chance to revive my singing career, to shine again on stage, and to do what I loved.

The program was being held in the Alps, a place I had always dreamed of visiting.

I wasted no time. Despite feeling my bones aching because of David's abuse, a new energy emitted from my heart and I rushed back home.

Mrs. Greta had someone deliver the divorce papers at home as she promised. I signed the papers immediately and took care of the necessary arrangements before leaving the country.

I dumped all the decorations and furniture in the house outside, along with all the photo frames that didn't contain me, sold the house, severing ties with the past and the painful memories that lingered within its walls.

The money I got by selling the house I once bought with my life savings just for the family, was enough to live the best of my life for the rest of the six months.

I visited the shopping mall where David used to take Kate shopping.

“The dresses here are all fashionable and warm. You stay at home and do household chores. What will you do visiting this mall?”

That's what he had said when I had urged him to take me along as well.

But today, I bought all the dresses that I once wished to wear but couldn't. They all looked perfect on me. I bought matching accessories as well.

No one mocked me, no one looked down on me. Everyone in the mall appreciated my taste, some even asked me to help them in selecting their dresses.

The day of my departure arrived, and I stood in front of the mirror, looking at the person staring back at me. I was no longer the timid, submissive woman I once was. I was a woman reborn, ready to take on the world.

I took a deep breath, grabbed my bags, and stepped out into the unknown. Just before boarding, my phone rang. I checked it. It was Kate.

I ignored it. But, my phone kept beeping, attracting a few stares of people at me. I sighed and immediately checked my phone.

Kate had been sending messages on my social media app. Those were all the pictures of her visiting exciting places in the Alps. David stood by her side, affectionately holding her arms in all of them.

There were videos as well. Ethan called her ‘Mom’ in them. Max called her just ‘Grandma’ and David, well he was addressing her as ‘Darling’.

She even made a post of herself and David, with the caption: ""Love is in the air. Wishing my dear Sabrina could find happiness like I've found with David.”

I liked the post and commented ‘Advice accepted’.

FLASHBACK

The day started like any other. I woke up long before the sun had even thought to rise and I started doing my usual chores. It is an unspoken rule that once the members of the house wake up by 7 a.m. the house has to be perfectly cleaned and breakfast has to be ready.

It took me three months to come up with the perfect time to rise in order to get everything done. I wake up by 3 a.m. and spend the next two hours cleaning the entire house from top to bottom. I also have to be quiet because if my father wakes up then I will be in for a lot of punishment. By the time I am done with the chores, I start breakfast which usually takes around two hours as well.

As always, I was finishing it up when my father walked down the stairs. I instantly rushed to his side with his daily steaming cup of black coffee. He took it from me with a dismissive nod and I quickly assembled his breakfast plate- eggs, bacon and sausages.

I placed them next to him and he didn’t even lift his head from his newspaper to acknowledge my presence. I refused to allow the pain show on my face as I swallowed down my hurt. It is my birthday and he couldn’t even be bothered to say a happy birthday to me.

“Good morning father,” His response was a deep grunt and a hand waving me off. “Did you rest well?”

“Do you not have any work to do Amelia?” his tone was an obvious dismissal.

I didn’t allow the pain phase me as I knew my sister would be up soon so I quickly made her special green juice that she drinks every morning.

I had poured it into her glass when she gracefully came down the stairs. My sister- Brittany- and I are twins although she is older by a few minutes. We look nothing alike though; I have very curly brown hair that is a nightmare to tame and hazel eyes while she has long blond hair and icy blue eyes. She is also tall and slender while I am shorter and have more curves. I have been told I look like our mother who died a few years back but she is a splitting image of our father.

As soon as father saw her, he pulled her into a warm hug and kissed her forehead then wished her happy birthday. He told her how proud of her he was and a stray tear slipped down my lips. I don’t know why he never treats me like her- we are twins after all. What does she have that I don’t?

“There you are,” he held her at arm’s length so he could see her, “How is the birthday girl?”

“I am so excited daddy,” she squealed, “And I cannot wait for the party tonight. Thank you so much for throwing it for me.”

“Anything for my darling,” he kissed her forehead again then he saw me watching them, “Are you going to stand there or will you bring in our breakfast?”

I muttered a small apology and hurried to hand her breakfast tray to her. As usual, she didn’t say thank you, she just took it out of my hands and delved into a conversation with father. Once again, I ignored the pain and clutched my own plate tight to my chest as I felt like an intruder in their special moment.

It has been like this for as long as I remember.And a part of me is tired of wishing that thing could be different.

When they were done eating, they left their dishes on the table and went to get ready for the day. I was still cleaning up when they left the house, leaving me in complete and utter silence.

As soon as I was sure that they were gone, I snuck out of the house into the woods that had taken over at the back. It was quiet and I was sure that no one would bother me there.

I followed the marked out path that I had become familiar with over the years. I can navigate this path blindfolded and in my sleep because of how many times I had gone through it, especially in the past few weeks.

I got to a small cave. It wasn’t big enough to draw attention to it but it was big enough that I could go in and practice without being disturbed. A few feet into the cave lay a few books I had taken from father’s library without him noticing a small blanket for when the days got colder.

I sat cross legged on the floor and imagined all the different types of wolves I had seen. I imagined my father’s which was large and black with dark brown eyes. It towered over me easily in my human form and for a very long time it terrified me.

I imagined my sisters which was smaller in size. It was a dirty brown color and in her wolf form, she had the same icy blue eyes as she did in her human form. Her wolf was graceful and petite and I smiled as I thought back to a memory of her running.

I let the feeling of completeness wash over me and I willed my own wolf to come to the surface but nothing happened. I tried harder, even tried picturing what my own wolf would look like. Would it be dirty brown like Brittany’s or black like my father’s? Maybe it would even be a different color, sandy blond or even a deep brown. I didn’t care what color it was, I just wanted it.

I don’t know how long I sat there willing, wishing and praying for my wolf to come to the surface but it never did. As the seconds ticked by I got more and more frustrated. I thought I felt hair o my skin and I opened my eyes in excitement, glad I had made a little effort but the excitement dissipated when I realized it was a stray feather.

I let out a barely contained scream and buried my head into my hands. Angry, hot tears burned beneath my eyelids and for a moment I wondered if I would ever get my wolf. For a moment, I wondered if it was even worth it at all.

But then I remembered why I was doing it all in the first place- Blake. Blake and I have been together for a while and I know that the only way for us to stay together is for me to get my wolf and then we can be properly mated.

He was the reason I started this four months ago and I am not giving up now. I wiped the tears from my face and gathered myself to my feet. I can always try again later.

I stepped out of the cave and was shocked by how dark it was. I ran as fast as I could to the house and looked at the huge grandfather clock that stood in the living room and cursed; Blake will be here to pick me up any minute from now.

I took a very quick bath and changed into the prettiest dress I own. It is an old dress I have had for a while, father said he couldn’t spare any money for a new dress for the party but that doesn’t matter because as long as I am with Blake, I am happy.

I snuck into Brittany’s room and applied a little bit of her makeup to make me look pretty and I tied my hair up into a high ponytail and waited at the bottom of the stairs for Blake to knock. I glanced at the clock and saw that he was running a bit late but I figured there must have been an emergency.

What else could it have been?

...

I waited for half an hour before I realized that something was awfully wrong. Blake is very late, in fact, we would always argue about the fact that I was always the late one. He would always arrive a few minutes early for any event and I was seriously starting to worry.

I called him with the house line and the first time it went to voicemail but the second time, he picked up on the forth ring.

“Hey,” I said as soon as the call had connected, “I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay because you’re never late.”

He muttered a small curse under his breath, “I’m sorry Amy; I won’t be able to pick you up today. Something really important came up at the last minute.”

“I-,” I trailed off, “You could have called me Blake, I was waiting here for you.”

“I’m really sorry Amy; I promise I will make it up to you.” There was a voice in the background that he paused to respond to, “Look, I have to go; I’ll see you when you get here.”

“Okay, bye.” I had barely finished what I was saying when he disconnected the call.

I tried to calm my heart and hide my hurt. Blake has never done anything like this to me before so I am sure that there is a very plausible explanation. He probably lost track of time and forgot that he had to pick me up.

I went back into my room and opened the old shoe box I had turned into my piggy bank and took out some of my savings for a taxi.

Our house was so far away from the main road that I had to walk for about another half an hour before I was able to find a single taxi. The driver’s charge was outrageous but I knew it would probably take twice the time to find another one so I agreed.

When I got to the venue, the party was in full swing. It was holding in a huge event center that father had rented out. Brittany had been talking about how it just opened and she wanted to be the first person to host a party there.

It was a large three story building with pure white walls and large glass windows and doors. On the front porch was a large crystal chandelier and from the clothes the butlers wore. I knew the entire place probably cost a fortune.

As I stepped out of the taxi, the smell of wine, sweat and a lot of perfume assaulted my nose. I paid the driver and made my way down the huge parking lot and into the front doors.

Most of the people I could see were friends of Brittany’s. I don’t have a lot of friends and Brittany wouldn’t let me invite the few that I had because she said it would ruin her perfect image and father agreed.

As soon as the people noticed me, I saw them begin to whisper and I started to feel a little self conscious. I looked down at my faded gray gown to make sure it wasn’t ripped anywhere but regardless, it looked cheap compared to the designer clothes that they people here were wearing.

“What the hell is that piece of rag?” a girl asked out loud and the entire party dissolved into a fit of laughter.

“It looks like she picked it out of a dumpster,” another offered.

A guy walked up to me and he fisted the material between his thumb and pointer finger, “it even feels cheap too. I’m sure if I tugged a little then it would rip right off.”

He pulled a little like he was going to rip it off and I gasped and pulled back in shock which made everyone laugh. I needed to get out of there immediately but they were all surrounding me.

“I can’t believe you’re even related to Brittany,” the first girl spat, “I mean look at you. Do you even know what a gym is?”

“Please just let me leave,” I pleaded and her face turned into a mock pout.

“She looks so cute when she begs,” she laughed evilly and then in one quick move, she faked a fall and spilled her champagne all over the front of my dress. “Whoops; that was an accident.”

The entire room dissolved into laughter and I pushed through the crowd to get into the bathroom. I tried my best to pat it down with water but it only made a bigger mess on the dress.

I knew I had to dry it out so I waited until the coast was clear and I snuck up the stairs to find a balcony or a porch. I finally found one on the second floor and rushed towards it when I saw that it was already occupied.

I quickly hid so that the occupants wouldn’t see me. They were wrapped in each other’s arms and passionately kissing so I’m sure they wouldn’t have seen me either way. I was about to leave when they pulled apart and the moonlight illuminated their features. I had to slap a hand against my mouth to stop the gasp from spilling out.

It was Brittany and Blake.

The shock had me rooted to the spot as Brittany ran her hand across my boyfriend’s cheek affectionately.

Is this what he meant when he told me that he was busy? He was here with my twin sister and they were making out. How could she do this to me and how could he do this to me?

“Didn’t you like that Blake?” she asked and he nodded, “Well I’m tired of us having to do it in secret. It has been so long.”

“I’m till with Amelia.” He said and she made a deep sound of disgust at the back of her throat.

“Why are you even with her?” she spat, “She has no wolf and she is not even strong. If you mate with her, you will go lower in the pack hierarchy. Why don’t you just leave her?”

“I can’t just leave her Brittany; we’ve been together for a long time.” They still hadn’t realized I was watching.

Brittany sighed and kissed him again, deeper this time. His hands wrapped around her waist and she pulled back leaving him following her for more like a lost puppy. She stroked the back of his neck softly as he gazed deeply into her eyes.

“If you break up with her then you can be stronger Blake,” she whispered, “If you mate with me instead then our union will be strong enough for you to be the future Alpha.”

“What are you saying Brittany?”

“I’m saying we are two of the strongest wolves in the pack. Imagine what our union would do.All you have to do is reject her,” hearing those words leave her mouth had me freezing in my tracks.

I carefully made my way furtherinto the balcony and hid behind a pillar so she wouldn’t see me. She had her hand on his shoulder and I could see him thinking about her offer.

“All you have to do is reject her,” she repeated, “And you will have the position of the future Alpha.”

I waited for him to tell her no, to tell her what he told me almost every day. I waited for him to tell her that he loved me and he was not going to let me go but instead, he was silent. I could see the way his brows furrowed and I knew that he was thinking about it.

The hurt rang deep and I turned around to leave but in a rush, I pushed over a potted plant and two pair of eyes came landing on me- one in surprise and one in victory.",1,1753336017.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

1m7w8eq,https://i.redd.it/pro7r9xyfref1.png,Ranking All Date Everything Characters (After 50 Hours),"I did a little tier list of all of the characters in Date Everything (minus the dlc) and after 50 hours and a few reloads, I finally finished the game. These are just my personal opinions of them but I'll give a small description for each tier. 



**SOME SPOILERS FOR CHARACTERS**  
  




**GO AWAY:**

Most of these characters either annoyed me or I just did not like them at all. Fantina was the worst as I could not get over her obsessive attitude towards me and how much she worshipped me. I liked how you can get her to stop doing that but her being “friends” with you felt forced and she just felt robotic unless you brought it up to her. She is not a character for me and so is Friar Errol. I don't like pastor-like characters to begin with and I also just did not really like his dialogue all that much. This applies to Vaughn, Rebel, and Scandalabra too as I just did not like their attitude much, they actually annoyed me, or I just did not like their design all that much. Dishy was just…odd to me and Lux is the only one I don’t actually hate all that much because he’s so much of an asshole influencer it's so good but so bad at the same time.



**Don’t Care/Indifferent:**

A lot of the fan favorite characters I’ve seen like Jerry, Harper and Dirk, Telly, and Washford and Drysdale I just did not connect with much. They had interesting stories and their voice performances were great, but nothing that made me fall in love with them. Harper and Dirk were just toxic and it was funny seeing them argue but also a bit awkward when Harper tried to get with me after leaving Dirk. Like ma’am???? ALSO, Harper was right about DIrk cheating on her cause all of sudden, he turns into Clarence and becomes obsessed with a body pillow?? This stuff was wild but not much to move the needle for me. Washford and Drysdale reestablishing their love was nice but I did not care and Telly’s rhyming scheme kinda bothered me after a while. Sorry for the fans of these characters but didn’t do much for me.



**Neat I guess:**

Most characters in this tier made me just say “That was neat”. A lot of them were not bad at all but I did not give them much thought after I was done with their route. Incredibly vocal performances specifically from Luke, Keyes, Ben-Hwa, and the fandom’s favorite Hector. Again, I didn’t hate anyone here but they were not characters that I paid attention to much after I got their ending. 



**Bestie 4 Life…or more:**Now THIS is where we get to the character I really liked. A lot of solid performances and stories from a lot of the objects here. The surprises for me here were actually Mitchell Linn and Timothy Timepiece as I thought they were going to be insufferable but I was wrong. Mitchell was actually really sweet and made me feel cared for. I expected him to be a bit pompous due to him being a critic but what I got was a guy who deeply cares about the experience and taste of food and wants to ensure his date enjoys it as much as he does. Timothy I actually do really like a lot too since his fixation on time I found immensely relatable. Maybe it is the neurodivergent in me but I couldn’t come to hate the catboy as much as I wanted to. But yeah, everyone here is great.



**Passionate Makeout Session:**

These are characters I would let plaster my face and body with kisses. A lot of these characters here I either appreciated for their story, vocal performance, or both. My favorites were definitely Connie, Tina, Bathesheba, Barry, and Beverly. Connie was super cool cause you had to come back every time to progress her story which reminded me of a rouge-like. Discovering her being separated from herself and regaining all of her memories made the playthroughs worth it. Tina and Bathesheba I liked cause they are absolute divas and they own that shit. Also, Bathesheba’s theme is my favorite in the game so that also helps. Beverely was also a character I really wanted to get the Love ending for but for whatever reason I didn’t. It sucks because I adore her arc and trying to increase the traction for her bar. I’m also very into mixology so she itched that fun part of the brain for me. The biggest surprise to me was Barry and his difficulty with memorizing things. I did not expect to relate to him as much as I did especially as someone who has ADHD but damn. Never judge a book by its cover or in this case, makeup products. 



**MIGHTY NEED:**I am down HORRENDOUS for all the characters in this tier. All of these folks in this tier list were lovely and each moment with them was a delight. Arma’s story surprised me because of how DARK it got and her being traumatized from seeing her previous house burn down. It was nice getting to stop her from relapsing into bad habits with smoking and I appreciated that. Curt and Rod vocal performances were fucking amazing and these guys had me twisting my hair and laughing from all of their dialogue. They have amazing chemistry with each other and I could definitely feel that in their performances. Miranda, Winnifred, and Dolly make me believe that anyone who has a southern or Spanish accent would have me on the floor with my face buried in my hands (WHY ARE THEY ALL HOT). Lady Memoria gave goth mother vibes, Nightmare made me question if I was monster fucker, and Sophia made me question how much I was into BDSM. The big two characters here that surprised me were Kopi and Shadowlord (or Skips). I didn’t know what to expect from them but man was I surprised. Kopi is an absolute sweetheart and I was glad she was able to start her own coffee place somewhere not at Roofbucks. Shadowlord was also a big sweetheart and his reveal of his true form made me love him even more. Also my headcanon is that Skips is somewhere under the trans umbrella because GOD I WANNA BE YOU MAN.



**STELLAR**:

Every single fucking time I go on Tumblr or hell, even this subreddit, these are *the* characters I look far. From their story, to their voice performance, to their music, to their fucking realization-EVERYTHING. I love everything about these characters in this tier. If these characters had their own standalone game or interpretation, I would read it in a heartbeat. All of them are taken from Mac’s funny innuendos, Mateo’s cinnamon roll nature, Betty’s comfort, Maggie’s detective cases, and Zoey’s entire story itself?!!? Two words: Absolute Cinema. Game highlights for me.



Anyways I’m going to go and save more Mac and Mateo photos to my phone. Thank you for reading.",0,1753335954.0,DateEverything,1,0.4,False

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient?

However, visitors are restricted to enter the second section. There is a shiva temple inside the cave which is one of the major tourist destinations for national and international religious tourists.

# Bat Cave

The Bat cave or Chamero Gufa in Pokhara is a perfect destination for those who long for an easy adventure. As the name suggests, the bat cave is filled with thousands of bats thriving in the dark, gloomy, and moist chambers of the cave.

These Horseshoe Bats are found clinging upside down on the ceilings of dingy caves. In the end, one has to wiggle their way through a narrow escape.

However, this cave could get extremely confined for those who have claustrophobia.

# Trek From Pokhara

As we all know that Pokhara is a perfect destination for exploring nature and natural resources. There are plenty of places where people can feel the best of nature.

With its mesmerizing Himalayan peaks to the crystal clear Phewa and Begnas lake, it is a hot destination for tourism. Apart from sightseeing, several treks can be carried out from Pokhara.

From the natural and cultural trek to Ghorepani to the amazingly long and short trek to Annapurna, Pokhara is the starting point for all of these treks.

 

# Short Trek |Ghorepani Poon Hill

Ghorepani Poonhill Trek is the most popular and relatively easier trek to the beautiful ethnic village of the Annapurna region. This trek lets you witness the Himalayan panorama and also lets you explore the local lifestyle closely.

Likewise, the Ghorepani Poonhill is a wonderful trek that provides you an opportunity to get a close view of Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Annapurna, and the other Himalayan ranges.

Apart from the natural landscape, you can explore the Gurung and Magar villages in Ghandruk and Ulleri.

This trekking route lies in the Annapurna region with the highest elevation of 3210m. It is a moderate trek and anyone with good health will be able to carry out this trek efficiently.

The tour starts with an hour and a half drive from Pokhara to Nayapul. Then from Nayapul, trek for about 4-5 hours to Tikhedhunga.

Similarly, the next trekking destination will be Ghorepani at 2874m. From Ghorepani, get a view of the stunning natural landscapes as well as the panoramic view of hills and the Himalayas.

Then, trek to Poonhill and Tadapani which takes about 5 hours, and finally reach Ghandruk, a popular Gurung Village. After spending time in Ghandruk, trek back to Nayapul and drive to Pokhara.

The trek provides you with an exceptional opportunity to get close to nature and witness the village life untouched by modernization.

In Poonhill, you can have a memorable snap and capture the best moments of impressive Himalayan ranges from here. On the other hand, this trek is relatively shorter and easier.

So, if you have a short time but want the best of nature then, this Ghorepani Poonhill Trek is suitable for you.

# Long Trek | Annapurna Base Camp

Annapurna circuit takes us to a region with diverse terrain, culture, and wildlife along with a spectacular view of the Himalayas. It is by far one of the easiest and shorter treks in Nepal.

The circuit trek is around the entire Annapurna ranges of central Nepal crossing the highest pass at Thorung La (5416m). The Annapurna circuit trek takes us through the edge of the world’s deepest gorge Kali Gandaki.

The circuit trek to Annapurna represents the stunning view of Mt. Dhaulagiri, Mt. Annapurna I, II, III, IV, Nilgiri, Machhapuchhre, Manaslu, as well as Himchuli and Lamjung.

On the other hand, the circuit trek introduces us to the popular tourist destination Manang, Mustang, and Muktinath in the Himalayan region.

One can experience the diverse culture, natural vegetation, geography, and different climatic zones of the Annapurna Region.

This challenging trek to dusty, bumpy, and narrow roads passes through several villages in Jagat, Dharapani, and Chame and reaches Pisang following the Marsyangdi river valley.

Besides, the trail passes through several Tibetan settlements with acclimatization. Then passing through Thorung Phedi the trek takes us to Thorong La Pass at an altitude of 5416m and finally to Muktinath.

Similarly, from Muktinath, drive to Tatopani and head up to Ghorepani Poonhill and witness the culture and tradition of mostly Gurungs and Magars living over there.

Likewise, from Poon Hill, hike down to Birethanti and then drive to Pokhara.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

A little back story I am considering switching my career to nursing at age 23. I already have a bachelors degree and my plan is to get my associates from a community college and then my BSN. 

Before I quit my job and make the decision to go back to school, I thought it would be a good idea to shadow a nurse. I’ve called all the hospitals nearby and none of them offer shadowing to non students. 

I know a lot of people complain about this job on here but I think it is something I would enjoy. Since I don’t know any nurses personally I thought maybe a kind stranger could help me out. If you work as a nurse anywhere in the Phoenix-metro area and could let me shadow you l would greatly appreciate it! I will buy you food and coffee!

1m7w4jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1m7w4jo/how_i_psyopd_my_brain_into_becoming_the_person_i/,How I psyop’d my brain into becoming the person I used to envy:  reading and gym rewired my reality [Text],"Two years ago I was chronically exhausted, scrolling through TikTok until 2AM, skipping workouts, and saying yes to things I didn’t even want to do. My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins:  It’s not just about toughness, it’s about identity. Goggins literally rewired his brain through action. His “cookie jar” method (collecting proof of your resilience) helped me build confidence from small wins. I used to think I wasn’t built like that. This book showed me I could be.

BeFreed: My friend put me on this smart reading app developed by scientists from Columbia. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, lowkey addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.

Huberman Lab: Dr. Andrew Huberman shares science-backed tips for rewiring your brain for focus, discipline, and energy. His stuff on dopamine and routines changed how I approached mornings. I used his cold exposure + NSDR + gym combo to reset my brain. Best free education on the internet.

Modern Wisdom: Chris Williamson interviews thinkers like Naval, Cal Newport, and Jordan Peterson. His conversations go deep into psychology, self-mastery, and discipline. I listen while lifting or meal prepping, beats music, and I always leave with a mental upgrade.

I used to scroll to escape myself. Now I read to evolve. Changing your life isn’t about forcing discipline. It’s about feeding your brain a new story until it believes it’s true. Once it does, it wants to help you succeed.

And me? They dumped me in some crappy apartment like garbage.  
Mom: ""$150 a month is plenty. Don't waste it.""  
Dad: ""Girls with too much money get in trouble. $150? Enough!""  
That's how my endless part-time job life started.  
But life is unpredictable—on a day when I hadn't been paid and was running a fever, I agonized before calling my parents to borrow money for medicine.  
Mom: ""I just paid three hundred for your stepbrother's piano lesson! You think I'm made of money? Leave me alone!""  
Dad: ""Another excuse for cash? Have some shame! Just started college and already begging for handouts! Deal with it yourself!""  
Years later, I'm driving my Porsche to work when my long-lost parents suddenly show up:  
""Yara, Mommy was wrong.""  
""Daddy was wrong too.""  
Oh really? Well then, let's break down exactly what you did wrong...

I folded my college acceptance letter neatly and stuffed it into my faded jacket pocket.

Just thirty minutes ago, Mom and Dad had waltzed in with their fresh-off-the-press divorce decree, slapping the keys down on the dust-covered table of this dumpy rental.

""This place is yours now."" Mom fluffed her freshly permed curls. ""Your dad and I will split tuition fifty-fifty. We'll take turns with living expenses—$150 a month each. That's plenty to survive on campus.""

Dad wheeled his suitcase toward the door. ""I'm moving in with Lisa. Your mom's got her new setup too. Don't go calling us every weekend.""

After they left, I stared at the empty apartment in a daze.

$150 a month?

Could I really make it work?

Seemed my only option was cramming in part-time jobs during breaks…

Before I knew it, move-in day arrived.

With my hard-earned three grand plus the $150 Dad sent, I started planning—

Four months this semester.

$800 monthly for dorms.

$200 set aside for books.

So basically... four months of busting just to cover the extras, and I'm supposed to eat on that $150?!

Dad's text popped up: ""Learn to budget. $150 is plenty if you're smart about it. Stop trying to keep up with everyone else's spending. Focus on your studies.""

This was the first time he'd reached out since the divorce, and it read like a coupon circular.

When I pushed open my dorm room door, my three roommates had already settled in.

I shoved my old broken bag under the bed, the cheap plastic rustling like a freight train in the quiet room.

When they all turned to stare, my face went nuclear.

I ate my first dinner alone in the corner of the dining hall.

Looking at the price board showing ""One meal combo: $15,"" I death-gripped the meal card in my pocket.

In the end, I could only swallow hard and buy two slices of bread, choking them down with free coffee.

After ten days like this, my budget notebook had ten hash marks. Each mark meant five slices of bread, with ""coffee: free"" scribbled next to them.

On Wednesday, Riley, my roommate, knocked on my bed frame: ""Hey Yara, we're thinking of going in on a mini washing machine. Like one hundred each. You in?""

One hundred bucks.

My heart plummeted.

I had exactly $120 left in my account this month.

Finally, I nodded anyway, barely squeaking out: ""Sure.""

The moment I hit send on that transfer, my phone showed a balance of $20.

I suddenly remembered losing fifty bucks for lunch money in middle school. Dad had biked me around the neighborhood three times looking for it, then emptied his entire wallet into my backpack: ""Don't let yourself go without.""

But now?

Everything changed.

During evening study session, the hollow ache in my stomach suddenly twisted, like someone was wringing out my insides.

My study buddy Jess slid over a chocolate bar: ""Yara, Jesus, you look awful. Low blood sugar?""

I tried to wave it off, but she'd already peeled the wrapper and pressed it into my palm.

""Eat it.""

As the chocolate melted sickeningly sweet on my tongue, my nose suddenly stung with tears.

Back in the dorm, I opened our family group chat—""Happy Family Forever""—which had been radio silent since the divorce.

The last message was still Mom's moving announcement.

My fingers typed and deleted, deleted and typed like crazy.

""Mom, Dad, had to chip in one hundred for a dorm washing machine. I'm completely broke for food now. Could you maybe send an extra $100 this month?""

God, the words felt like red-hot iron bu//rning my fingertips.

Yet the chat stayed silent all night.

Next morning, Dad came out swinging: ""Money again? Have you no shame? Already picking up this nasty begging habit? Christ, I'm starting to think you're not there to study—you're there to blow money trying to keep up with everyone else. What happened to what I told you about budgeting? You made this mess, you deal with it. Don't expect me to clean up after you!""

Before I could even process that, Mom's message exploded into the chat:

""Are you kidding me? I just shelled out three hundred for ONE piano lesson for your stepbrother this month. What am I, a freaking bank? A money printer?""

""Besides, you're a girl—how much could you possibly eat? I bet those fake friends of yours are corrupting you. Instead of focusing on study, all you think about is spending money! It's your stepbrother's birthday next week and I still need to buy him that gaming console. Handle your own problems and quit bothering me.""

Those two messages slapped me across the face.

I stared at the screen, my finger hovering over the keyboard forever, unable to type a single word.

So this is what I'd become—asking for one hundred bucks made me a ""spendthrift,"" a ""leech,"" a ""blood-sucker.""

My phone kept buzzing as they volleyed blame back and forth like I was some dirty soccer ball they were trying to kick away.

I suddenly remembered that divorce day, how they'd stood on opposite sides of the living room.

Dad saying ""I'll pay half tuition, max.""

Mom saying ""Why should I be stuck with living expenses?""

And there I was, standing between them like some unwanted piece of collateral damage.

That gnawing hunger came roaring back, worse than before.

I clutched my stomach and put my head down on the desk. My roommate gently touched my arm: ""You okay? Want to go to the health center?""

I shook my head, but tears started falling anyway.

Turns out $150 really doesn't cut it at a big-city university.

Turns out becoming an adult means nobody cares if you're starving.

Turns out parental love can fade like the ink on acceptance letters—give it time, and it just disappears.

Tomorrow I'd ask the cafeteria ladies if I could bus tables for meals. Maybe check if the campus convenience store needed night shift help.

Starting tomorrow, I'd have to earn every bite of food in college.

I started working the register at the campus store after classes—twelve bucks an hour. Working eight hours on weekends just barely covered next week's food money.

Walking out of the store, the night wind whipped rain into my face, brutal enough to make me shiver.

""Well, well, well, little girl.""

Three drunk guys stumbled out from behind some trees, reeking of booze and ciga//rettes.

The blonde one squinted at my soaked shirt, his mouth twisting into a revolting grin.

""All alone, sweetheart? Aw, why you running? We don't bite.""

Every alarm bell in my head went off: ""Get out of my way.""

""Ooh, feisty."" Blondie reached for my hoodie. ""Check it out, this chick's actually smoking hot. Way better than those fake plastic girls on campus.""

Scar-face started pawing at my waist. I kicked at his shin, but he grabbed my ankle.

I struggled and screamed: ""Get off me! I'm calling the cops!""

Blondie laughed: ""Come have some fun with us, baby. We might even tip you better than that shitty register job.""

Just as his hand reached for my shirt buttons, a flashlight beam cut through the rain and the security guard's voice boomed: ""Hey! You little punks!""

Scar-face let out a curse. Blondie tried to kick me before the guard's flashlight sent them all scrambling.

Back in the dorm, my roommates were already asleep.

I crouched in the bathroom, lifting my hoodie in front of the mirror—a massive bruise bloomed across my lower back where they'd shoved me against the wall.

Water gushed from the faucet as I covered my mouth to muffle my sobs, terrified of waking my roommates.

I let the tears fall on the floor, mixing with the sound of running water.

That night I sat on the edge of my bed hugging my knees, finally drifting off just before dawn.

A week before midterms, our advisor posted in the class group chat: ""Class fee due: $200 for study materials and class activities.""

""Yara, did you send yours yet? Deadline's tomorrow afternoon."" Megan asked while applying her face mask.

I mumbled ""still working on it,"" but my ch//est felt like someone had dropped a stone on it.

Desperate, I pulled up Mom's number. The second it connected, I wanted to hang up, but it was too late.

""What? Make it quick, I'm helping Benny with piano practice."" Mom's voice was already annoyed, kids laughing in the background.

""Mom, we have class fees due, two hundred dollars..."" My voice was barely audible.

""What? More money?"" Her voice spiked. ""What are you doing at school? Got a boyfriend? Let me tell you something, Yara—don't expect me to fund your love life!""

Click.

She hung up.

I called Dad.

It rang seven times before he picked up.

A woman's voice in the background: ""Who is it?""

""Dad, I need class fees, two hundred dollars...""

Dad's voice was muffled, like he was hiding: ""Oh... uh... class fees... I just bought your stepsister a new phone. Can't you borrow from classmates?""

His voice dropped to a whisper: ""This isn't a good time. Gotta go.""

Click again.

That night, while cramming finance formulas, the room suddenly spun and my textbook went flying.

I woke up on a cot in the health center.

The doctor's frown was deep: ""Low blood sugar plus exhaustion. Seriously, kid, what's going on? How many meals are you eating a day?""

I didn't dare tell the truth, just mumbled something about forgetting to eat while studying.

The doctor sighed and prescribed nutritional supplements—thirty-something dollars. My roommate beat me to the payment: ""Pay me back when you can.""

Lying in my dorm bed, I scrolled through Instagram and saw Mom's post—a grid of photos from an amusement park with Benny.

Caption: ""Baby's happiness is my greatest joy.""

Scrolling down, I found Dad's update.

He'd posted a photo of a piano—black, obviously expensive. ""Gift for my princess. This kid's got talent, gotta nurture it.""

Someone commented ""You're such a great dad,"" and he replied with a smug emoji.

And here I was, unable to afford thirty dollars for supplements.

I pulled out my phone and quietly muted the family group chat.

The day before break when the cleaning lady came to tidy up, I was crouched in the dorm hallway counting money.

Crumpled bills spread across my knees, fives and tens stacked up, the biggest one a fifty—overtime pay the bubble tea shop owner had thrown in.

""Yara, seriously not going home?"" Auntie pressed a bag of apples into my hands, ""The dorms lose power during break, so stock up on food.""

I carefully tucked the money back in my pocket, forcing a smile and nodding: ""Nah, saving on travel money.""

Truth was, I couldn't afford a bus ticket home—after paying next semester's $800 dorm fee, I had exactly twenty-seven dollars and thirty cents left in the tin.

Christmas night, I pulled out my last slice of toast and the dregs of peanut butter—well, this was my Christmas feast.

I opened our long-silent family group chat and saw Mom had posted a video.

Waves lapping at the beach, her in a floral sundress under palm trees, some guy's arm around her waist, that Benny kid holding ice cream and grinning.

Caption: ""Florida winters are amazing! Benny says we have to come back every year.""

Then came Dad's photos.

In the living room of his new place, he was standing on a stool hanging Christmas decorations while my stepsister held up star lights from below. His new wife stood nearby filming. ""Stella helping daddy with the star lights—what a perfect family.""

The chat messages flew by like they were competing—Mom posted seafood spreads, Dad countered with Stella's Christmas gifts; Mom bragged about Benny learning to swim, Dad showed off Stella's piano certificates.

Holding my empty peanut butter can, watching all that blazing happiness, I suddenly realized they hadn't even bothered with a single ""where are you spending Christmas"" message.

It's like I was never even part of this family.

Those Christmas carols we sang together, the snowmen we built, all those happy moments eating roast chicken together...

Were they all just dreams I made up?

As I swallowed the last bite of bread, my phone lit up again.

Mom posted a photo of Benny. ""Baby boy's Christmas haul: Lego set, remote control car, and a PSP. Gotta spoil the boys, right?""

Dad immediately followed up with photos of his princess unwrapping gifts. ""Our little princess got the royal treatment this Christmas—Elsa dress, glass slippers, fairy tale books, and a Disney annual pass.""

Fireworks suddenly exploded outside. I ran to the balcony to watch, brilliant colors reflecting off the academic building across the way like scattered gold.

But even the prettiest fireworks don't last, just like some people—they walk away and never look back.

On the last day of December, I rode the bus to Mom's new place with my twenty-seven dollars and thirty cents.

I'd practiced in the mirror the night before, rehearsing what I'd say.

Nothing about money, nothing about feeling hurt.

Just chat about school stuff, mention the new dining hall options, maybe ask if Florida sand really was softer than it looked in photos.

When the security guard at the gate stopped me, I gave him Mom's name, but he shook his head: ""No Andersons in this building. Only the Millers in that unit.""

It took me forever to realize—she'd probably even changed her last name.

Standing there confused on the sidewalk, I suddenly spotted a familiar figure.

Mom in a fur coat, holding Benny's hand as they came out of the grocery store, her new husband trailing behind with shopping bags.",2,1753335572.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

These are 10 detailed, actionable strategies that actually work—not overnight tricks, but practical habits that build long-term financial stability.

⸻

1. Pay Yourself First (Automate It)
Set up an automatic transfer to savings the same day you get paid—even if it’s just $25. When the money’s out of sight, you’re less likely to spend it. Treat it like a bill to your future self. Start small, then increase it over time.

⸻

2. Make a Budget and Actually Stick to It
Budgeting isn’t about restriction—it’s about clarity. Use an app or spreadsheet to track income and expenses. Separate needs, wants, and savings. Once you see where your money really goes, it’s easier to adjust.

⸻

3. Do a Spending Audit (It’ll Probably Shock You)
Track every dollar for a week or a month. Yes, every snack, coffee, impulse buy. Then group it into categories. You’ll see patterns, waste, and habits you didn’t know were draining your cash.

⸻

4. Use a 24–72 Hour Rule for Non-Essentials
Want to buy something over $50 (or whatever your threshold is)? Wait a day or two. Chances are, the urge fades—and you’ll save money without even trying. This curbs impulse spending fast.

⸻

5. Cancel Subscriptions You Don’t Use
Go through your bank statements and list every recurring charge. Be ruthless. If you’re not using that streaming service, subscription box, or gym membership, kill it. Small fees add up quick.

⸻

6. Meal Plan Like a Boss
Home-cooked meals save a lot. Plan your week, make a grocery list, and prep what you can in advance. You’ll avoid last-minute takeout and cut food waste. Even bringing lunch a few times a week makes a big difference.

⸻

7. Shop Smart at the Grocery Store
Don’t shop hungry. Stick to your list. Compare unit prices. Choose store brands. Use sales and digital coupons. Buy dry goods in bulk when they’re discounted. Your grocery bill is one of the easiest places to save.

⸻

8. Cut Utility Bills Without Sacrificing Comfort
Turn off lights, unplug electronics, fix leaks, and adjust the thermostat a few degrees. Use weather stripping. Take shorter showers. These changes feel small—but they lower your bills month after month.

⸻

9. Negotiate Your Bills (Yes, Really)
Call your internet, phone, or insurance providers and ask for a better rate. Research competitors first. Mention promotions. Even a polite “I’m thinking of switching” can get you a discount.

⸻

10. Build an Emergency Fund—Start Now
Even $500 stashed away helps you avoid going into debt when stuff hits the fan. Aim for 3–6 months of essential expenses over time. Make it automatic. It’s the best financial cushion you can have.

⸻

Final Thought
None of these require a huge lifestyle change. Just consistency. Pick one or two to start. Let the results build momentum. Your future self will thank you—quietly and repeatedly.",1,1753335186.0,KrispyAdvice,0,1.0,False

It had seen Rick Astley meet up with Elton for the first time at that coffee shop for the first time. It understood now how it had been birthed into this world, and it wasn't through Elton's magical belly. It had seen it's parents for the first time.

# Stevie Wonder walks up to ring ring and gently pats his hand on it's shoulder, a single tear running down it's face as it all comes crashing in, all at once. Alas, it finally wakes up, but today, something's changed. It doesn't view its so-called 'parents' the same anymore. A boiling anger seethes inside of ring ring ring, witnessing it's gay parents lock lips, thinking about the lives they took away.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

1m7vyfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_sugar_load/comments/1m7vyfm/my_sister_has_started_wearing_glasses/,My sister has started wearing glasses,"Growing up I suffered relentless bullying from my sister Chloe. My parents obviously favoured her so she could get away with murder.

She was the popular girl at school who would sleep with any guy who so much as even glanced in her direction. I on the other hand was a complete nerd who spent most of my time reading the Discworld collection by Sir Terry Pratchett.

Her main avenue of abuse was towards my glasses. I have very bad eyesight so was practically blind without them. She took great pleasure in hiding them at school and making others laugh at me while I stumbled after her trying to get them back.

She would also call me a bookworm and tell me no man would ever date a woman with glasses.

We lost contact at 18 when I moved away and changed my number. I didn't even remain in contact with my parents as they had ignored her abuse towards me.

Recently I was at a family gathering and bumped into my sister for the first time in over a decade. My jaw almost hit the floor as she was wearing glasses.

I was instantly confused as she sneered at me and immediately called me a bookworm. I pointed out she was wearing glasses, but she casually admitted that they were for aesthetic choices. She snatched my glasses from my face and broke them beneath her feet. Luckily I had a spare pair but knew I would have to spend a fortune replacing the broken ones.

I could barely contain my anger throughout the rest of the night, and watched on silently as she got more and more drunk. 

I volunteered to drive her room and she was slurring out the word “bookworm” even while I helped her into my car.

The next afternoon I was eventually awoken by her screams and made my way outside to find her tied to the ground with sellotape holding her eyelids open.

She begged me to free her but I just stood over her sipping a cup of coffee. I winced at the smell of burning flesh before leaning down and telling her that she will probably need glasses by the end of the day.

I took one last look at the magnifying glasses placed directly over her eyeballs, and wondering how much damage the midday sun would do to them, before walking inside to reread a Discworld novel.

Myers-Brigg (if you’re into that): INFJ. Would prefer someone with a different MBTI.

I prefer to be low profile.

What I don’t do: bars, clubs, partying, 420, drugs, alcohol, coffee, video games, meaningless entertainment/pleasure, high quantities of shallow friendships based on cliques/insecurity/fear of being alone, keeping up with the joneses, materialism, modern self-centered values, tattoos, piercings, posting on social media, addicted to phone, selfies

Would prefer a Christian aged 18-30 with traditional values, a good heart, kind, chastity, selfless, virtuous character that has saved themselves for marriage. The one that wants to be in one of those marriages that happily last 50 years and has the growth/beginners mindset necessary to become the person to do so. If we can respect and trust each other, then that is a solid foundation to start on. Very few people have the patience, humility, responsibility, and self-sacrifice needed to be in a marriage that goes to old age in our generation now. I hope to be the exception and find one too; hence why I’m making this post(s). Would prefer someone between 18-31.

1m7vua4,https://i.redd.it/dcjyfxdlbref1.png,"Happy Divorce, My Husband! - I used to be a mafia princess. Now? I’m just the help. I gave up my empire for love.","Chapter 1



I used to be a mafia princess. Now? I’m just the help. I gave up my empire for love. Walked away from the Rossini name, the gold, the power—all for one promise Edmund made me on my eighteenth birthday.



“One day, baby, I’ll take you around the world.”



Thirty years later, I’m invisible in my own home. Mocked by my grandsons. Ignored by my son. And replaced—body and soul—by my perfect, venomous sister-in-law, Elizabeth.



I knew. Everyone knew. Elizabeth was Edmund’s mistress. But I kept my mouth shut. I believed—foolishly—that Edmund would change.



Then came my forty-eighth birthday.



I dared to ask Edmund for one thing—a cruise. Just a simple cruise.



He brushed me off like I was nothing.



But the truth hit me like a bullet.



I found their cruise tickets. Edmund and Elizabeth, sailing away with my son, my daughter-in-law, and my grandsons—all celebrating Elizabeth’s birthday.



I was left behind by all of them.



I smiled, bitter and cold. Grabbed my suitcase. Booked the next flight back to my real home.



Back to the dangerous daughter of a mafia king—the one Edmund always feared and the alliance he’s been desperate to control.



That was the moment I found my voice—clear. Calm. Sharper than a blade.



“The divorce papers are waiting for you.”



There was a stunned pause, then Edmund’s voice cracked through the line, “You’re joking. You can’t divorce me.”



I laughed. Cold. Cruel. Cutting through the silence like a knife.



“I can.”



\--



I was supposed to be the ghost in the house.



I never asked for jewels. Never asked for roses. Just one promise. One promise.



A cruise.



Edmund had said it back when he still had a soul. “One day, when we're rich,” he whispered into my hair, “I'll take you around the world, baby. Just us.”



That was before the money. Before the empire. Before I became his wife in name, and his maid in practice.



And today’s my 48th birthday. No one ever greeted me. No cake, no candles.



And I thought maybe—just maybe—it could be mine.



I brought it up after dinner. He was still in his chair, polishing his pistol with that same old cloth like it was a sacred ritual. The flatscreen TV was playing some old Western no one was watching. My heart was pounding harder than it should’ve been.



“Do you remember what you told me… on my 18th birthday?” I asked quietly.



He didn’t look up. “Which part?”



“That we’d travel. See the world together. You said once the business settled and our boy was grown… we’d go. On a cruise. Just us.”



“Are you out of your mind?” Edmund chuckled, “You think you deserve a cruise? Look at you. You look like a bamboo stick. One gust and you're gone. You think the captain’s gonna see you and roll out a red carpet? No, Doris. He’s gonna think you’re hauling walking bacteria on board.”



""But today is—""



""Today's what?"" He finally looked at me. His face was older, heavier now. “You’re not young anymore. The world’s not kind to women like you out there. You're not like Elizabeth.”



There it was. The name that always hovered between us.



Elizabeth. My sister-in-law. His brother’s widow. Slim, golden-haired, always dressed like she stepped out of a fashion magazine. She judged me with her eyes every time we were in the same room. Edmund never corrected her.



“She’s younger,” he continued, “travels for business. Makes appearances for the family. She’s part of the image. But you—you’ve always been the one behind the scenes. That’s where you shine. The house. The family. You keep things running.”



Behind me, the twins were laughing. My grandson.



“Yeah, Ma, you look like a skeleton in a funeral dress,” said Lyle, smirking.



“Smells like old mop water and something foul,” Nash added, pinching his nose.



They burst into snorting laughter. No one stopped them. No one ever did.



Lester, our pride and failure, leaned against the fridge and shouted across the kitchen, “Hey, Ma. Wash my clothes, yeah? My wife is busy right now. And bleach the white ones this time, unless you wanna ruin another set.”



“I’m not your maid,” I murmured.



“What was that?” he snapped.



“I said I’m not—”



He threw a half-empty soda can at the floor. “Then what the heck are you? Because you sure as heck ain’t doing anything else in this house! You don’t bring money in.”



My blood boiled.



“I raised you,” I snapped. “Fed you. Stayed up when you had fevers. I’ve been working since before you were born.”



“Well, maybe you should’ve worked on smelling better. You smell like a rotten corpse,” one of the twins piped.



“Yeah,” snickered his brother, Nash. “It’s embarrassing just seeing her. Our classmates said she’s so ugly, they get scared when she shows up to pick us up. Like some cast member from The Walking Dead.”



They both burst into giggles. Then Edmund grabbed his pistol off the mantel, inspecting it like it mattered more than me.



“We got money, Doris,” he muttered. “You know that. But I’m not wasting it on some useless help. You’re here. You got two hands. Why on earth would I hire a maid when you’re the woman of the house?”



The woman of the house. That was whatever he called me.



But I didn’t own anything. Not a car. Not a card.



Every cent I needed, I had to beg for. And if I asked for more? He’d demand an itemized receipt. Penny by penny.







\---







That night, when the noise died down and the family disappeared into their rooms, I walked to the bedroom, pulled out the old red suitcase from the closet. The one he bought me in Naples before our wedding.



Before the world twisted into what it is now.



I looked down at my hands. They didn’t look like mine anymore. Lined. Broken. Tired.



I used to be someone. A Rossini. The daughter of a mafia king. The girl born with gold in her mouth and fire in her spine. But I gave that up for love. I disowned myself from my family, thinking Edmund’s love was enough.



And now?



Now I was just the ghost in the house.



No kingdom. No crown. I have enough already. Maybe, leaving this family is the best birthday I could give to myself.







Chapter 2



The next morning…



I heard about the dinner from Lyle—he blurted it out while stuffing potato chips in his mouth.



“Elizabeth rented the whole top floor of the Luciana Hotel! Fancy, huh? Dad says she booked it just for us. Big celebration.”



I paused mid-mop. “Us?”



Nash answered, “You’re not coming, Ma. Grandpa said you're... not up for it. I mean, look at you.""



Not up for it... Like I was sick. Or senile. Or something to be pitied.



By sunset, the house was empty. Edmund had shaved. Wore the cologne he only touched for business deals and funerals. He stood tall in his navy suit, fixing Lyle’s and Nash collar like a proud grandfather, and Lester wore his best suit.



“Remember,” Edmund said to them, “Elizabeth’s doing this because she loves us. She's family.”



“We know, grandpa. That's why we love Elizabeth more than Grandma Doris.” they answered in unison.



And then, nothing. No goodbye. No we’ll bring you something. Just the sound of the front door closing like a coffin lid.



The quiet afterward was insulting. A hollow that screamed louder than any slap.



I stood in the middle of the hallway, in my house slippers, holding a basket of unfolded laundry. My stomach growled. I hadn’t cooked. What for?



Out of spite, I turned on the TV. They were on the news.



A live segment from the Luciana Hotel.



Cameras panned across crystal chandeliers and violin quartets. There they were—Elizabeth in her fur shawl. Edmund beside her. My son and his wife smiling like politicians. Lyle and Nash sipping soda in a tiny tuxedo.



The reporter called it: “A private Morroco gathering—Elizabeth’s homecoming. The family behind one of the largest shipping fortunes in the country.”



I was not in the shot. Not in the credits.



Not even in the whispers.



They toasted champagne. I sipped stale coffee.



They laughed under golden light. I wiped a smudge off the glass door.



And just when I thought it couldn’t cut deeper, the camera caught a brief, brutal moment:



Elizabeth leaned toward Edmund, whispered something, and they both laughed.



My son chuckled too. I didn’t know what she said. But I knew it was about me.



I felt it in my teeth.



\*\*\*



Hours later, just after midnight, the door opened again. I turned. Hoped, stupidly, it might be my son. But no—it was them.



Elizabeth’s heels clicked confidently across the marble as she half-carried Edmund, drunk and swaying, into the house. His tie hung loose, lips pink from too much wine. Eyes bleary, glazed.



“Oh, Doris,” Elizabeth said with a smirk, spotting me standing by the staircase like a ghost. “Didn’t think you’d be awake.”



She steered Edmund toward the hall, her arm looped through his like a bride on her wedding day. “Lester and the twins are staying at my penthouse. Too tired to come back. But Edmund… well, he can’t sleep in strange beds. Poor thing.”



A lie.



I knew it.



She came here only to shove the truth down my throat.



“I told him not to worry,” she continued sweetly. “I’d bring him home. Take care of him. It’s what family does, right?”



Then she reached into her tote and tossed a plastic container at my feet. It bounced once, landed near the rug.



“Leftovers,” she said. “Go eat, sister-in-law. You look like a sickly little stick. You should really take better care of yourself. Bet you weight like 30kls.""



I didn’t move.



My fingers curled into fists at my side.



“I’ll put Edmund to bed,” she added with a sly smile. “I know you two don’t share a room anymore. He told me. Said your side of the bed always smells like disappointment.”



I took one step forward. Just one. My palm twitched. Slapping her would’ve felt good. Almost holy. But what for?



My heart was already cracking in my chest like ice under boots. And the real punishment was in what I saw next—



Edmund, drunk and limp, smiled at her like she’d hung the moon. “Elizabeth’s so pretty,” he mumbled. “Smells like peaches. Mmm. Doris smells like dishwater and arguments.”



They climbed the stairs together. I stayed behind. Frozen. Shaking. She laughed once more before they disappeared down the hall.



And I realized—



They didn’t kill me.



They just replaced me.



\*\*\*



I waited.



Not because I cared. Not because I hoped. But because I needed to know.



The clock ticked past one. Then two. Still no sign of her. The upstairs lights stayed on. No footsteps on the stairs. No sound of a door closing. Only muffled laughter. Then silence.



I sat on the edge of the couch in my robe, untouched coffee cooling on the table. The house smelled of lemon cleaner and betrayal.



Maybe she fell asleep in the guest room. Maybe she just—



A thump.



Then another.



Not heavy. Rhythmic. Too… intimate.



My blood chilled.



I rose, like something pulled me forward by the throat. I climbed the stairs, slow as a prayer. The hallway stretched like a graveyard path. The door to our bedroom—his bedroom now—was cracked open.



And I saw.



Elizabeth, unclothed, straddling Edmund. Her red nails dug into his chest like claws. Her head tilted back in a mess of curls. And Edmund—my husband, my life partner of 30 years—grunting beneath her like an animal.



My legs stopped working. My mouth went dry.



She cried out loud, shameless, her voice like a blade across my spine.



“Ohh… Brother-in-law—don’t stop. Fill me. Ruin me like she never let you.”



Edmund murmured, “You’re perfect. Not like her. You’re everything, Lizzy—”



I ran.



I didn’t cry. I ran. Straight to the downstairs bathroom and vomited until my ribs cramped.



The sound of them still echoed in my ears, louder than sirens.



“Harder—make me forget she ever existed!”



“You were always the one, Lizzy. Always.”



He was fifty. She was forty-five.



And still, they had no shame. Not even a sliver of decency. They weren't just in-laws. They weren’t even just lovers. They were conspirators. Twisting the knife slowly—together.



I stayed on the cold tile floor, knees pressed to my chest, my body shaking in waves I couldn’t stop. It wasn’t about the intimacy. It was about being erased.



Replaced.



They didn’t just want to humiliate me. They wanted to watch me rot in the house I built. But a woman who survives this?



She doesn’t stay on the bathroom floor. She remembers. She plans. She learns how to haunt quietly.







Chapter 3



I woke before the birds.



No alarm. No reason. Just the reflex of a woman trained to serve everyone but herself.



No tears. No ache. Just breath. In, out. Hollow.



I wiped my face with a damp cloth. Lip balm. Hair tied low. Not beautiful—just functional. Alive enough to pass.



Then I reached under the bed.



The red suitase was there. I dragged it out, unzipped it two inches. Cash from quiet sales—empanadas, lumpia—no questions asked. Passport, maiden name. A photo of me at eighteen. Smiling. Bold. Untouched by the slow erosion of marriage. I zipped it shut.



Downstairs, the kitchen was still dark. I boiled water, cracked eggs, sliced bread. My hands moved on their own. Stir. Season. Flip. Feed.



I was pouring coffee when I heard them behind me—bare feet against the hardwood. Her giggle first. Then his laugh.



They slid into the kitchen like a couple on a honeymoon. Elizabeth wore one of Edmund’s button-downs, half open. Her legs bare. Hair tousled like she’d just rolled off him, which she probably did. Edmund looked freshly showered, like their night together was some kind of baptism.



“Coffee, Doris,” she said, yawning like a cat in sunlight. “Make his strong, mine half and half. You know how he likes it.”



I handed them their mugs without a word.



Edmund didn’t even glance at me. Just sipped. Then said, “Bacon and omelet, Doris. Lizzy loves it the way I do. None of that salty mess you used to make. She's watching her figure—not that it shows, huh?”



Elizabeth chuckled and leaned against the counter like she owned it. “Not everyone wants to look like a stick wrapped in sadness, sweetie.”



I smiled. Not out of kindness. Just strategy.



Smile. Just smile. You’ve cooked for enemies before.



I cracked more eggs. Let the oil sizzle. Pretended I didn’t hear them talking about the night. About the penthouse. About how soft the sheets were. About how Edmund snored less when he was “with her.” About how my shampoo made him sneeze. They ate like I was the maid. Talked like I wasn’t real.



Then the front door flung open.



“Family’s here!” Lester’s voice boomed like a sitcom dad. “Let the party begin!”



Loisa followed behind him, heels clicking against the tiles, holding up a new designer purse like it was the Holy Grail. “Mom, look! Elizabeth gave me this! Can you believe it? Real leather! Italian! And these earrings? Gifted. God, she’s such a giver.”



She twirled like a child. Like she didn’t already own closets full of things Lester bought for her. Not that he ever bought me a single scarf.



Behind them, the twins stormed in with that careless energy only teenagers have. Lyle was wearing sunglasses indoors. Nash had something massive covered in brown paper.



Loisa laughed again, too loud. “Didn’t you hear? Lizzie gave us the whole penthouse. We slept like royals. You should’ve seen the tub. Bigger than our bedroom.”



“Oh, and the view,” Lester chimed in, opening a bottle of wine without asking. “From the 36th floor? Breathtaking. Sun hits the windows just right. Like a painting. Like—perfect.”



It was nine in the morning.



Nash and Lyle dragged their ‘surprise’ into the living room and tore off the cover. It was a giant, glossy print of the family, taken at the Luciana Hotel gala. Everyone dressed like aristocrats. Posed like nobility. Elizabeth in the middle. My sons beside her. Edmund’s hand resting on her body.



I wasn’t in the picture.



“Look, Grandma!” Nash said with a smirk. “Don’t we look like a real family here?”



Lyle added without blinking, “Too bad you weren’t there. Oh wait—yeah. You were left behind. Guess you looked too much like our maid.”



The room exploded with laughter. Even Edmund. Even my son. Even Loisa, wiping tears from her eyes.



Elizabeth just sipped her coffee and said cheerfully, “Don’t worry, Doris. I’ll leave some of my old dresses in your closet. And some perfume. They’re a little tight on me now, but I think you can squeeze in.”



Edmund chuckled, not even looking at me. “You can dress a corpse in Versace—it’s still a corpse. She still smells like disappointment.”



Loisa practically screamed laughing. Nash and Lyle clapped each other like it was a roast battle.



And me?



I picked up their dirty plates. I washed them one by one. I stared out the window at the neighbor’s lemon tree, blooming.



They think this is the end. But they haven’t seen what I look like when I stop begging to belong.







\---







That night, when the laughter died and the wine ran out and the house went still, I crept into the living room. I stood there staring at it again.



The portrait. Massive. Hung dead-center in the sala like a crown jewel.



Lester made a whole production out of placing it there. Right above the console table. Right where no one could miss it. Where guests would pause and admire the happy family and say, “What a beautiful household you have.”



A lie, printed in high gloss.



I didn’t even hear Edmund come in until he was behind me.



“What, jealous again?” His voice always sounded rougher when he was bored. “You stare at that thing like it’s gonna cry for you.”



I didn’t answer. What was the point?



He scoffed. “Come on, Doris. If I could turn back time… I swear, I would’ve left you back in the province. Should’ve married Elizabeth from the start. She’s better than you in every freaking way. Classy. Successful. Knows how to run a business. Knows how to shut up.”



I turned away, still quiet.



That’s when he kicked me.



Right in the knee. My leg buckled, and I dropped with a thud I was too tired to even burst at. The floor met me like an old friend. Cold. Familiar.



The tears came without permission. Warm and humiliating. Not because of the pain. No. I think it was because of the sound of him walking away like I wasn’t even there.



“Enough drama,” he muttered. “You’re too old for this thing.”



Then his phone rang.



I could still hear my breath catching in my chest when he answered it.



The tone of his voice changed instantly. “Hey, baby,” he said, like I wasn’t even on the floor. “Mmm, I missed you already.”



I wiped my face slowly, one sleeve at a time.



His voice dropped into something warm. Giddy. Teenage. “Yeah, yeah, I’m packing. Can’t wait to see you in that bikini again. This cruise’ll be insane. You and me. Open sea.”







Chapter 4



I didn’t follow Edmund.



He walked away, still giggling with Elizabeth like a boy on prom night, whispering into his phone about bikinis and champagne like I wasn’t still on the floor with my knees aching and my soul halfway gone.



I stood. My knees creaked. My hand smudged across the tile, picking up dirt and pride. I walked to the bathroom. Closed the door quietly. Stared into the mirror like I didn’t know the woman staring back—eyes puffy, cheek red, hair undone. Like someone who tried to cry underwater and failed.



There’s no funeral. But I’m mourning.



Not for him. Not for us.



For me.



For the girl I used to be before love took her name and silence stole her voice.



Just then, he passed by. Didn’t knock. Didn’t ask if I was alive. Still on the phone, laughing—then paused long enough to say, “Pack my things. Business-leisure trip. We leave tomorrow.”



No “please.” No glance. No soul.



I nodded. Not that he was looking.



I dried my hands on the crooked towel. Walked to his room like a maid. Opened the closet. Chaos—suits tangled with polos, shoes under dirty laundry. A grown man living like a spoiled teen.



I started folding his shirts. White linen. Navy power. Cleaned his cufflinks with my sleeve.



Then I bumped the side table.



A folder slipped. I picked it up, expecting tax papers. But inside—cruise tickets.



I blinked.



I read them twice and my fingers tightening.



Edmund Morocco. Elizabeth Morocco. Lester. Loisa. Lyle. Nash.



My name wasn’t there.



Not even as a +1. Not even as a footnote.



The cruise? The one I dreamed of...



But now? Elizabeth’s birthday is in three days and he has time? He remembered hers.



Not mine.



Never mine.



I folded the tickets gently. Like they could bleed.



Then I packed his suitcase. Polished his shoes. Ironed his pants. Lined up his deodorant and vitamins like hotel staff would.



Lester walked in. No knock. “Ma, pack my stuff too, yeah? Loisa’s busy.” He sipped a beer. “Don’t forget the twins. Nash wants his charger. Lyle needs the blue swim shorts. Snacks too—they get bored.”



Then he left. And I packed it all.



Tiny shorts. Rolled t-shirts. Loisa’s perfume wrapped in a sock. Ziplocked snacks labeled with love.



Then I went to my room. Quietly. Closed the door.



I sat there on my bed, hands trembling, and my mind drifted back. Back to when I was just eighteen.



When Edmund wasn’t a man who kicked me in the knee or forgot my name on a cruise ticket.



Back when he said things that sounded like promises…



\*\*\*



I was fresh out of school, a girl still unsure of her own shadow.



Edmund looked at me, eyes soft and serious, like I was the only thing that made sense.



“Doris,” he said, holding my hand like it was the only thing steady in his wild world, “I swear, I’ll take care of you. Always. No matter what happens, you’ll never have to worry about a thing.”



I smiled, my heart so full it felt like it might burst.



“Even if the whole world turns its back?” I asked, barely breathing.



He nodded. “Especially then.”



Then another flashbacks...

I know 😩👎,"Okay I’m throwing this here cause I gotta get it off my chest and I feel like maybe there’s some other gay boys who will relate. Fucking delulu story time let’s go 🎉

So basically I started working with this guy back around June/Julyish? We are both in our 20s but there lowkey is a 5 yr age gap (I’m older.) I trained him at our job and we clicked really quickly. He told me he was planning on moving to a different country Jan 2025 which was the same country I was supposed to move to in 2022 but I got scammed out of a ton of money (that’s a whole different story) and it never panned out for me. We ended up becoming super close and started hanging outside of work a decent amount 1-1/in groups. 

I asked him if he was a straighty one time which he responded with “uhh idk I mean I could see myself being bi but you never know.” For me I kinda felt like maybe there could be some sort of spark because I mean I was definitely feeling it the more we hung out. 

So there was one night in Dec we went out to the bars with a group for his birthday and we all got v drunk. We ended up taking Ubers back to my place and I ended up being in an uber w just him. There were some very sexually suggestive comments that were made in the car which really made me 👀 him. We got back to my place and all watched call me by your name cause he and another person had never seen it. Him and I were right next to eachother the whole film and lowkey didn’t even watch. Him and I were just yapping the whole time. There was a point where I stood up to go smoke and this man in front of everyone spits out “yea I definitely think I’m bi, ask ‘my name’ cause he would know best.” Bruh that shit had me shook cause what fucking straight man is gonna say that shit in front of everyone. 

Also though there was a girl who we were hanging out with that night who is absolutely stunning imma just refer to her as R

So right around Christmas time, he ended up housesitting for me and watched my cat and made sure that she stayed alive. Basically I got back home from my trip and he was working so I went through to go pick up my house key and to see him. Keep in mind we worked at a drive-through coffee shop so I drove through and he was the only one in there. I asked how his Christmas was and he told me that it was actually pretty crazy and he got this big smile on his face. I told him “I have a guess as to what the crazy is” and he responded with “what?” I said “does it have to do with R?” and he got an even bigger smile in his face and said “yes.” my stomach kind of dropped cause I just thought damn I was kind of hoping that wasn’t the case. He said he cares for her a lot and feels like he’s developed feelings for her, but he moves so soon (to the other country) and he doesn’t really know how she feels so he doesn’t know if he should tell her or not. After he said that I said “same” and kind of made a face and he said “what was that.” and I said “nothing. I just feel that.” and he said “what do you mean by that?” to which I tried changing the subject, but he kept pushing, so I eventually said “I feel that because I feel the same way towards you.” and then I kind of backtracked and essentially said “if you’re feeling things for homegirl go for it.” I called one of my friends right after and told him about me confessing my feelings for homeboy and my friend and I just cringed about the whole thing and my friend and I came to the conclusion that I should just not bring it up ever again and just move on. Anyways, the boy I’m into got off of work and called me right after and said he wanted to talk about it more. I basically just told him how much I cared for him and how I have grown very affectionate towards him and that I respected our friendship and wanted to be able to stay friends regardless 🙄 he was super super sweet about it and told me how much he appreciated me telling him and how you should never go in life not saying how you truly feel and you never really know the answer until you’ve asked or spoken your feelings. And then he proceeded to say that he was into R and he wanted to see if anything could happen there. He said if anything changed in the future, he would let me know though.  🙄 again

Anyway, a month goes by. We definitely weren’t hanging out as much but he was also busy getting ready to move out of country. We still got several good hang out sessions in and ended up going to the beach with a group a week before he moved. During that trip, I had made a joke about him being bi and he said that he wasn’t “bi and he’s straight.” I was kind of caught off guard because as far as I was concerned when we had been hanging out one on one, he was at least bi-curious and he also said that in front of group of people, but I just kind of moved on and was like whatever.

He ended up leaving to go to the other country and I wrote him a letter before and definitely left some flirtiness in there kind of in Hope that maybe at some point in the future, something could work out. That’s definitely the delulu though 🤦 we had chatted on iMessage and sent some reels back-and-forth, and had a phone call or two but communication was mostly kept minimum for the first few weeks. 
About three weeks went by and I get a call from him and he’s crying and he told me that his dad was in the hospital and it seemed like he was not going to make it. I asked him if he had the financial means/capability to come back to see his dad before he passed and he said he did And ended up making the trip back. I saw him a decent amount when he was back in town for a month and I just fell so much more into him than I was even previously. He was obviously going through a difficult time though, and I didn’t want to add anything extra so I just kept my feelings to myself and just was there for him when he needed it. I dead ass went to his dad‘s funeral though which was pretty crazy to do for a boy you’re into I am aware. 
Oh Also R just disappeared during his whole month back which was pretty crazy too.

Anyways, after he went back to the country, he had already moved to. He ended up FaceTime/calling/texting me every single day while he got back. That lasted about a month until I just felt like I was being tortured because here I am head over heels for this man who doesn’t really want me back yet, He’s still giving me so much attention. It was fucking with my head I called him one morning and told him that I had to cut him off for a bit because I was in too deep with my emotions and talking to him just really was starting to hurt me because it hurts when you care for someone that deeply and they don’t feel the same way towards you. We ended up not talking for about a month until he broke the no contact and said he wanted to check in on me and see how I was doing. Since then we’ve been talking again not as frequently, but we still game with each other a decent amount and we still FaceTime and talk on the phone here and there at this point I feel like I should be over this, but I still feel absolutely delusional about it at the same time. I have had a really really hard time developing feelings for people in the past. When I’m into someone, I’m into them a lot and it’s only happened with maybe two other people in my life. I know I definitely need to get out and move on but goddamn how do you get over someone you never even dated.

Sorry for this monstrosity of a novel but thanks if you made it this far 🙏🏻 feel free to speculate/beat tf’ing delusion out of me verbally

Alright, friends, gather 'round! 🙌 Ever felt like the whole world is waving a giant camera in your face, expecting you to step up, smile, and give them the best TikTok dance of your life? 😅 Yeah, me too. But what if I told you that you can thrive without ever stepping in front of that lens? 

**Faceless content** is the name of the game, and believe me, it’s a treasure trove waiting for you. Let’s dig into why now is the *perfect* time to jump on this bandwagon, before the AI rush sweeps us off our feet.

- **No more mug shots!** Seriously, who wants to put on makeup or choose a cute outfit every single day? With faceless strategies, you can create valuable content while lounging in your PJs. 🙌

- **Flexibility:** You pick your pace! Whether you're a night owl or an early bird, you can create content when it suits you best. Sounds dreamy, right?

So, how do we get started on this magical journey? Here are some juicy strategies:

1. **Voiceovers and Narration**: Use your charisma through words! Record your thoughts and let funky visuals do the talking. Your voice becomes the star!

1m7vql5,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofpositiveupdates/comments/1m7vql5/5_simple_habits_that_quietly_change_everything/,5 Simple Habits That Quietly Change Everything,"1.	The Two-Minute Rule
If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. Hang up the towel. Answer that quick text. Wipe the counter. These things don’t belong on a to-do list—they belong done. Tiny tasks pile up into noise and clutter, mentally and physically. Doing them right away keeps life lighter.

2.	Guard Your Sleep Like It’s Your Job
Most things feel worse when you’re tired. Bad moods, bad decisions, brain fog, all of it. Sleep isn’t something to squeeze in when everything else is done. It is the foundation. Get enough of it and you’ll handle the rest of your life better, period.

3.	Say “No” Without Guilt
You don’t owe your time to everyone who asks. A polite no is a boundary, not a betrayal. If something doesn’t feel right, drains you, or derails your priorities—it’s okay to pass. Protect your peace.

4.	Approach Life Like a Beginner
Drop the need to know everything. Ask basic questions. Be curious, even about routine stuff. A beginner’s mindset keeps you open, humble, and learning. It also makes the ordinary feel a little more interesting.

5.	Write Down One Good Thing
Once a day, note something that didn’t suck. A good cup of coffee. A laugh. A quiet minute. This tiny habit helps shift your focus from what’s wrong to what’s working. Keep a list. Read it when life feels heavy. It helps more than you’d think.

⸻

Low effort. High return. Nothing fancy—just solid habits that make everyday life feel a little less chaotic and a little more yours.

When arriving into HK,stayed 5 nights  


Day 1- Hostel - Level 13 - felt major swaying/dizziness/nausea/vertigo-ish symptoms  


Day 2,3- Level 11- Hotel- big building- no feelings of dizziness.  
Day 4,5 - Back to original hostel - But Level 18- MAJOR dizziness again, felt like room was moving and friend with me thought its all in my head (well literally it is )



Left HK now -->.Back to a normal hotel in Thailand...But the symptoms haven't gone. As of 16 hours since arrival

In China (June)   Level 13/Level 10/Level 18 buildings were fine. Didn't feel anything. But HK tall thin buildings July 20th? The Swaying made me so dizzy , even when lying flat in bed .



  
**Q - is this permanent?  Or temporary?** I'm so worried. I already have tinnitus but no vertigo symptoms ever. .  And Im relatively fit, healthy, gym training , walk alot , drive just fine Although I drink plenty of coffee/tea - but nothing big.   
  
I just did 5 months backpacking and walked forever (Japans stations= marathons- worth the Famchiki tho)  


**Fatigue -** Is it excess fatigue from so much travel and then triggered by tall building swaying? (Was typhoon week)

Vision fine/ No Vomiting. Eating fine. etc.  But balancing/ dizziness/head heavy(Back of head)  
  
Apologies if this is a repeated Q **but As of July 2**4th, its been 4 days and symptoms aren't going away.  3 years adapting to Tinnitus - I really hope this is not some permanent new change.  Im on ground floor now and it's still there.

  
For now - I'm reducing all caffeines, shall try sleep earlier, more water, grounded barefoot walks and some supplements but shall go Drs soon 

Any help- much appreciated.

If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. Hang up the towel. Answer that quick text. Wipe the counter. These things don’t belong on a to-do list—they belong done. Tiny tasks pile up into noise and clutter, mentally and physically. Doing them right away keeps life lighter.

2.	Guard Your Sleep Like It’s Your Job
Most things feel worse when you’re tired. Bad moods, bad decisions, brain fog, all of it. Sleep isn’t something to squeeze in when everything else is done. It is the foundation. Get enough of it and you’ll handle the rest of your life better, period.

3.	Say “No” Without Guilt
You don’t owe your time to everyone who asks. A polite no is a boundary, not a betrayal. If something doesn’t feel right, drains you, or derails your priorities—it’s okay to pass. Protect your peace.

4.	Approach Life Like a Beginner
Drop the need to know everything. Ask basic questions. Be curious, even about routine stuff. A beginner’s mindset keeps you open, humble, and learning. It also makes the ordinary feel a little more interesting.

5.	Write Down One Good Thing
Once a day, note something that didn’t suck. A good cup of coffee. A laugh. A quiet minute. This tiny habit helps shift your focus from what’s wrong to what’s working. Keep a list. Read it when life feels heavy. It helps more than you’d think.

⸻

Low effort. High return. Nothing fancy—just solid habits that make everyday life feel a little less chaotic and a little more yours.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

So I’ve been to new york quite a bit and have mostly done the touristy things (empire state building, the met, etc etc) and this time I’m visiting a friend who’d interning for the summer, and I’m gonna be bopping around the city alone during the day! A small part of this trip is I’m really trying to get the NYC vibe a bit more, and see if this is somewhere I might want to be after graduation.

My goal is to just have a nice time with good vintage shops/bookstores/coffee shops. I know the soho/west village part is good for that, but anywhere else I should check out?

If there’s any food rec’s near these areas, please let me know as well. Thank you so much!

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand.

I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Samsung Lions vs. SSG Landers: A KBO Showdown Where the Lions Roar (and the Landers Meow)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a KBO clash that’s less “baseball” and more “Samsung’s latest ad campaign.” The Samsung Lions, favored at **-150 to -170** (implied win probability: **60-62%**), are coming in like a well-optimized smartphone—smooth, efficient, and slightly smug. The SSG Landers, at **+220 to +240** (implied win probability: **38-41%**), are the underdogs, which in baseball terms means they’re about as likely to win as a squirrel trying to steal a hotdog from a stadium vendor.

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Lions Are the Bet

The bookmakers have set the spread at **Samsung -1.5**, meaning they expect a comfortable victory. For context, that’s like ordering a “small” coffee and getting a *large* in return. The total runs line sits at **10.5**, with the **Under** slightly favored (odds: **1.85-1.91**). This suggests bettors anticipate a pitcher’s duel—or at least a game where neither team forgets their sunscreen (i.e., scores stay low).

Samsung’s dominance isn’t just numbers; it’s flair. Kim Jeong-ho’s recent “Scene-Stealer” award for a jaw-dropping ground play? That’s the KBO’s version of a superhero origin story. If the Lions’ defense is half as sharp as their marketing team, the Landers might as well pack their bags and go home.

### News Digest: Injuries, Highlights, and a Touch of Drama

While there’s no explicit injury report here, let’s extrapolate. The SSG Landers’ recent struggles? They’re like a drama series that forgot its plot—lots of potential, zero execution. Meanwhile, the Lions’ offensive firepower, as seen in the Uni-President Lions’ 6-4 win (thanks to Lin An-ke’s heroics), hints at a league-wide trend: teams with a “Lin An-ke” (read: a one-man wrecking crew) tend to win. If Samsung has their own secret weapon, expect them to unveil it l

1m7vczz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1m7vczz/how_do_i_suck/,How Do I Suck,"Hi I’m 23 and I have my first boyfriend he’s 27. It’s been a month and a half of dating and we’ve been getting to know each other emotionally, we talk on the phone everyday and have gone on a few coffee dates. When the topic of being sexual came up early on I told him I am not comfortable with having sex for at least 3 months or until I warm up (which he gracefully respected). 
Now things are getting hotter and heavier , our make outs have become even more sensual and we have started to grind and stuff. Even on our phone call last night the subject matter got a bit sexual cause we both are ready to go beyond kissing but not sex yet for sure , like oral. Except I HAVE NEVER sucked a dick before , I tried with a hookup before but I just couldn’t pull through. lol and there was a point on the phone where he had his phone on the floor to adjust something and I said “ I like this view” implying that I wanna suck it the next time I saw him. He did ask if I do suck AND I SAID YES

When I saw my stepsister's text message, I was completely confused.

Until the next message that came through from Amber was a picture of my boyfriend, Derek, and her in bed together.

They were undressed, and Derek was behind Amber, leaning over her, while she was on all fours. It was very obvious from the picture of what they were doing.

\[What is this?\] I had no idea how to respond to this. I felt like my heart was in my throat, and I was doing everything I could to fight back the tears.

He told me that he was working. But what’s this?

I can’t help thinking how many of those times he slept with her and then came home and slept with me.

I feel so gross. I heard his car pull into the drive.

A wild plan came to my mind.

————————

OAKLEY

I sit in the darkness of the livingroom of the home I share with my mate, the beta of the moon river pack, Derek Wright. It's late.

Probably after midnight. I can't bring myself away from the window to check the time as I watch for his homecoming. I am praying to the moon goddess that nothing bad has happened to him and that his phone just died.

Hoping he just got caught up in his work and that's why he didn't contact me to let me know he would be late.I pull myself out of my thoughts of horrible things happening and decide to get changed for bed. I put on my comfy, soft pink pajama pants and a plain black night shirt. I pull my long blonde hair into a bun and brush my teeth.

Once I have completed all my nightly, before bed routine, I find myself back in the darkness of the livingroom. I sit in the window seat and stare out the window.Haven, my wolf, has been pacing in my head, a feeling of unease coming from her. I don't dare to ask her what is wrong because I fear her answer. I also cannot ask her to stop pacing, despite the headache it's beginning to give me, because I understand why she is pacing.I try reaching out to Derek through the mind link for what feels like the hundredth time only to be met with silence.

If we were marked and mated then I would be able to feel him, feel his emotions. I would know if something was wrong. But Derek insisted we wait. He won't tell me why or when but just that he is waiting for the right time.

Everyone knows that we are fated mates. It's not a secret. As soon as we discovered we were mates he insisted I move in with him. I attended beta training with his mother. She treated me like I was a daughter and also said I was excelling at beta training.I was so lost in thought that I nearly jumped out of my skin when my phone dinged, signaling a text message. I pick it up to see a message from my half sister, Amber.

When I was little my mother was killed in a rogue attack protecting the alphas wife. My dad was devistated. For a few years it was just us but he decided to take a chosen mate, Bailey. For a few years everything was good. She was kind to me and treated me like a daughter. Until she had Amber. After that, whenever my dad was not around they would treat me like I was their slave. Bailey would tell me that I could not say anything to my father because I would destroy his happiness and it would make me selfish. I didn't want to see my dad upset again.

I remember what it was like when my mom died and how he could barely function at first.I'm a little surprised that she is texting me since we barely speak to each other. She is probably at a party and is drunk. Why else would she text me? Deciding I could use this as a temporary distraction I open up the message.Amber: hello big sister.Oakley: what do you want?Amber: is that any way to talk to your sister?Oakley: if you don't have an actual reason for texting me then goodbye.Amber: oh, but I have a reason.Amber: I just wanted to thank you.Oakley: for what?Amber: for sharing your mate with me.Oakley was confused.

Until the next message that came through from Amber was a picture of Derek and Amber in bed together. They were undressed and Derek was behind Amber, leaning over her, while she was on all fours. It was very obvious by the picture of what they were doing.

I wasn't even sure how she was able to get a picture like that without having someone else take it or setting up a camera.Oakley: what is this?I had no idea how to respond to this. I felt like my heart was in my throat and I was doing everything I could to fight back the tears. Haven was howling in agony in my head.Amber: oh don't be so surprised.

I am far better then you. In everything according to Derek. That is why he will be taking me as his chosen mate and rejecting you.I didn't even bother responding. I knew she was just trying to get under my skin. And it was working too. I felt awful. My mate, my fated mate, was cheating on me with my own sister. And now I understood why he wasnt marking me yet.

Because I would feel every indiscretion. Every time he cheated I would know. But as long as we were not marked I would have no idea. All these times I thought he was just working late. I wondered how many of those times he slept with her and then came home and slept with me. That made me feel so gross and angry. I knew I couldn't stay here any longer.I heard his car pull into the drive. I hurried to the bedroom and got into bed.

There was no way I was going to confront him right now. I needed a plan. I needed some time to think.I could hear Derek come into the house. I hoped he wouldn't come to me because I am not sure how long I could pretend to be asleep and keep it together. It was taking everything I had to not cry and give myself away. I didn't want to hear his excuses.

Haven is sulking in my mind. Going back and fourth between wanting to claw his eyes out to painfully howling.I can hear his heavy footsteps as he gets closer to the bedroom, the floor creaking under his weight.

He comes into the room and pauses for a moment. I don't move, I won't risk him coming to me. After what feels like an eternity, which was probably only seconds, he makes his way into the bathroom. I can hear the shower come on and I breath a sigh of relief, releasing my breath that I don't even realize I was holding in. I was glad he went to shower because I could smell my sisters scent mixed in with his. He was careless this time it seems.

That or I was just to blind to notice. Maybe I was even in denial.

A few times I when I was paranoid and thought he was cheating I had expressed it to him and he always claimed he would never do that, that the fated bond was sacred.""Does he know that Amber sent that picture?"" I think to myself.

Then I am doubtful about it. I decide that I should probably try and get some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be a really long day. I have a lot to do.

I tossed and turned all night. Knowing that the past year of my life has been nothing but a lie. I wondered who else knew.

I waited for Derek to get up and leave for work. I did not want to even look at him. I knew I would start to cry. I was still not ready to have any conversations with him. As soon as I heard his car pull away I crawled out of bed.

I know the turmoil of emotions I was feeling would not help me to make any good decisions but I also knew that I could not stay here any longer.I headed to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee. Just the thought of eating anything made my stomach turn.

I leaned over the island in the kitchen while I waited for the coffee to be finished and spaced out. I was trying hard not to think about my current situation but thoughts of the past kept coming back to me.

Were there signs of his indiscretions? Was I naive?

I felt so stupid as I thought about all the little red flags that I just ignored. The aroma of coffee hit my nose, pulling me from my thoughts. With a sigh I retrieved my cup, add some creamer to it and then headed back to the bedroom to get dressed and pack up all of my belongings.

I had no idea what I was even going to say to anyone.I put on a pair of blue jeans and a pale pink, form fitting T-shirt.

One of the benefits of being a werewolf was that our bodies were always in shape. Even if we didn't work out we metabolized everything much faster. However, being the daughter of the head warrior of the pack, I was very much in shape.

I grew up learning to fight and keeping up with physical fitness.I went through the house, room by room, gathering all of my belongings and putting them on my bed so I could pack everything. I made sure to leave behind anything Derek had given me. I did not want any reminders of his fake affections. I pulled my duffle bag out of the closet and my suitcases out from underneath the bed. Once I had everything packed I put them by the front door.

My phone buzzed a few times while I was packing. I ignored it because I wanted to get things done quickly. I picked it up to see some missed text messages. One from my dad asking why I was not at training, one from Bailey saying she needed to speak with me, one from Amber saying her mother wanted to talk to me and one from Derek saying he might come home for lunch and that I should consider wearing something revealing.

That last text made my stomach churn and I resisted the urge to vomit. Slipping my phone into my pocket, I grab my bags and head out to my car. I do not want to be here when Derek [arrives.As](http://arrives.As) I close the trunk after putting my bags in a car pulls up at the end of the driveway. It's Bailey and Amber.""Hello sister."" Amber says in a sickly sweet tone. I have to use all of my self control to not punch her in her stupid face.

All I can see is the picture she sent of my mate and her in bed together. But before I can open my mouth to say anything Bailey speaks.""We need to talk Oakley."" She says.""I don't have anything to say to either of you."" I respond, walking towards the driver side of my car.""Well you might not have anything to say but you will listen."" Bailey says as she steps between me and my car, blocking my path.""What do you want?"" I know that I will not get out of here until they say whatever it is they want.""There is no need to use that tone with me you ungrateful brat.

I am your fathers mate and you will treat me with respect."" Bailey snaps at [me.It](http://me.It) takes everything in me to not roll my eyes at her. I just stand there waiting for her to continue. When she realizes I am not going to respond she continues on.""Amber will be with Derek now and you will accept his rejection when he rejects you.

You will also not tell anyone that he was cheating on you and that the rejection was your idea. You will not tarnish Derek and Ambers reputation. She is more suited to be a beta's mate then a nobody like you."" Bailey said.I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

There was no way it was going to happen like that. I also knew that there was no way I was going to be able to stay at my dads because they would make life a nightmare for me. I would be treated like a maid when my dad is not around.

I thought Derek was my savior but it turns out I was wrong. And there was no way I was going to impose on my best friend, Erica, when she had just found her mate, Billy, from a neighboring pack. I was super happy for her.I didn't respond and Bailey grabbed my face by the cheeks, squeezing just hard enough for it to hurt but to not leave marks.""Do you understand?"" She asked, looking me dead in the eye with a look of anger in her eyes.I knew that if I said no she would do something bad right then so I decided to just pretend to go along with it for now.

""Yes."" I gritted out between my teeth.

I decided right then that I was going to leave the pack. I would stop at the bank and take out all of my savings and be gone before anyone knew. I would call my dad when I got to my destination. I didn't want him to talk me out of what I was planning on doing. I knew it would hurt him, my leaving without saying anything to him, but I needed to get out of there.""Good."" Bailey spits out as she lets go. The both of them get into Baileys car and drive off. I sigh and get into my car. Haven was trying hard to get out and attack them but I held her back. One thing that a lot of people didn't know was that Haven was massive and strong. She was bigger then a normal wolf. She was more the size of an alpha wolf with pure white fur. I didn't shift in front of anyone. Amber and Bailey were always jealous of Haven so I wasn't allowed to shift in front of them. Though they claim that their wolves are scared of her size but Haven has spoken to their wolves and so I know the truth. My dad told me to be careful who I shift around. He said that a lot of people out there might be intimated by Haven.I start up my car and head to the border of the river moon pack, dreading what I was about to do. It was not something many wolves did.""We can do it. We are strong enough to get through it."" Haven whispered in my mind.

As soon as I got across the border I spoke the words I never once in my life thought I would have to say.""I, Oakley Simpson, reject you, beta Derek Wright, as my mate."" A searing pain goes through me as I feel my end of the bond snapping.

I hear the agonizing howl of a wolf and felt bad for his wolf, Aries. I knew he was not at fault. I also did not know that Derek was in wolf form.""Do the rest."" Haven said.The next part I know will be painful, more so mentally then physical.""I, Oakley Simpson, reject the river moon pack as my pack."" I say with tears in my eyes. I hear the howls of many wolves who felt the bond of a pack member snapping from the pack.

The only way a member leaves the pack is to reject the pack or die and they had no idea which it was. Most pack members leaving are announced before it happens so everyone knows to expect it.""We need to go before they start looking."" Haven says sadly.

I know this is all just as painful for her as it was for me I hear my phone buzzing and look down to see Derek calling me. Hitting the ignore button I put my phone on the passenger seat and head off towards my destination. Everything is painful now but I will get through it and move on to a better, brighter future.",1,1753332936.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False

My dad handed me an article he came across in an old box of stuff he had. An interview Playboy did with Th Great One  - in April of 85. 

Sat down with a whiskey and a Padron 2000 with this nice read. Its wild to step back into hockey history - this was before I was born and very early into what became the most legendary hockey career of all time. 

 An equally simple yet legendary cigar seemed appropriate. Ive got about a year and a half on this box - and let me tell you - if you like classic padrons do your self a favor and buy 2 boxes. One to smoke this year and one to sit on. 

This cigar has coffee, dark cocoa, lighter nicaraguan spice (much spicier when younger) - the perfect smoke with a neat overproof bourbon.

 Who else out there reads while they smoke?

 * Comfortable Clothes After a Long Day: That moment you slip out of work attire or everyday clothes and into something soft, stretchy, or perfectly worn-in. Pure bliss!
 * Connecting with Friends or Family: A quick call, a text that makes you smile, or just spending time with people you care about. Human connection is fundamental and always a mood-booster.
 * Stepping Outside on a Perfect Weather Day: That feeling when the temperature is just right, the sun is shining (but not too hot), and there's a gentle breeze. It's an instant invitation to relax and enjoy the moment.

Hello all, today marks day 40 of losing my partner. 

He (36M) and I (33M) had been together for 6 years, during this time he was very vocal about the struggles with MH he's had his entire life. The beginning years of our relationship was something out of a movie, he would shower me with so much love and affection. He would take us on vacations as much as possible, take me to plays, introduced me to a huge community of incredible people. Truly he showed me a whole different world. And I loved it, I loved him.

Sadly, ever since the pandemic he just couldn't bounce back as well as everyone else did. His substance use increased dramatically, his self doubt took over every aspect of his life. I tried my best to constantly remind him of how incredible he was and a gift to the world, but sadly it wasn't enough. 

Earlier this year he found himself in some serious legal trouble which would have almost certainly resulted to him being in jail for a few years. Once this came about, I knew that he wouldn't be able to recover from this.   
  
It resulted in him obsessing over the court case, every conversation we had was about the court case, he would constantly cry himself to sleep thinking about the results. Again, I reassured him that we will live a long life together once this all blows over, we will get through this, together.

The last night we had together we both had a long and stressful day at work. We both came home and took a nice nap together, I woke up and started making a nice dinner for the two of us.

Once it was done I came and woke up him, we ate and he complimented me the entire time (as he normally did) ""how do you know how to just make this? its so good! I'm so impressed with everything you can do!"" (I'll never forget that meal).

After the meal, the conversation started going back to the court case, I had a huge presentation the next day and just asked him ""hey, can we just watch this documentary tonight and cuddle together? We can talk about this another day but lets just chill tonight"" He apologized and agreed. 

A few moments later he asked me if I would take the fall for him, I was outraged. 

I know he asked me this because he knew I was stronger than him, and that I would be able to take the emotional stress this was bringing him. But it's not the right thing to do, and I couldn't do that for him.

I got upset with him and proclaimed ""You did this, you need to take responsibility and face the consequences, but this is on you. I can't take the blame. This will all blow over and life will go on after this.""  
  
He didn't say a word, but the look on his face was just pure defeat and sadness, (I'll never forget that face). He stood up went into our guest room/office, I continued to watch the doc so I could cool down from the anger of this request. Later on I was on my way to our bedroom and overheard him chatting to someone on the phone and he seemed to be in good spirits, so I left him be and went to bed. 

I woke up around 6am to use the washroom and could see the light was still on in the guest room, I found that odd and apart of me knew what had happen. But I didn't let myself believe he would actually do that, especially in our home. 

When I woke up and got ready for work I noticed the light was still on. I showered, made a coffee, got myself ready for work and went to go give him a goodbye kiss as I was heading out. (he would often sleep in there due to my sleep apnea so it wasn't that abnormal)

I opened the door and saw that the bed was still made, once I opened the door fully I found him hanging in the closet with my extension cord. 

I screamed and cried, ran to him and touched him, once I saw he was blue, cold and stiff, I knew it was too late. I cried out to my roommate who called 911.

That was the worst day of my life, the day constantly replays in my mind and I can't get the image of him out of my head. I thankfully have a huge network of support right now. My friends and Mom organized someone to be with me the first 20 days, and provided meals. 

I love everything everyone is doing for me, but I feel it's not enough. and no fault of them, it's just not him. 

In moments like this he would be the one to comfort me the best, and know exactly what to do and say.

I'm getting by, but I am struggling. ",8,1753332501.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

But what I do before the market opens is what actually keeps me consistent.

Here’s the exact routine I follow every single morning:

**- 4:30 AM – Wake up (2 hours before the market opens)**

I don’t touch my phone. No emails. No charts. Just get vertical and get moving.

**- 4:35 AM – Cold shower**

Instant alertness. Forces presence. No better way to break sleep inertia.

**- 4:45 AM – 20 min walk or stretching session**

Gets the blood flowing. Movement before momentum. It clears mental fog better than any podcast.

**- 5:10 AM - 4-7-8 breathwork (10 cycles)**

Inhale for 4 seconds

Hold for 7 seconds

Exhale slowly for 8 seconds

There is 5-10min guided videos on YT

This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reduces anxiety and sharpens focus. Especially important before a day of high-stakes decisions.

**- 6:00 AM – Black coffee + no screens**

Caffeine hits better when I’ve been awake for \~1.5 hrs. Also prevents anxiety spikes or rushed decisions.

**- 6:30 AM – Game plan review (no trades yet)**

I have a hard rule, no trading the 30 minutes before open. Instead, I use that time to:

Review my game plan (must be written the night before)

Chart out the overnight session (Asia + London highs/lows)

Update key levels or bias only if the overnight session justifies it

I always ask these 3 questions before entering a trade:

Where is price drawn to?

What is liquidity telling me?

Do I have confluence or am I forcing it?

No trade gets taken without a clear answer to all 3. No exceptions.

This routine isn’t about being perfect. It’s about showing up sharp, focused, and regulated, so that I can execute my edge without hesitation.

1m7v1nk,https://i.redd.it/8baz933s1ref1.png,"Hi do you know any other narratives, episodes, movies, series, books etc like this ?","For as long as I can remember, I’ve been enamored with narratives where a group of people, or even just one person is trapped by a higher being, force, power, or individual that either controls them or pushes them over the edge. I’m referring to stories like *I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream*, where an all-powerful AI tortures the last remaining humans; *USS Callister*, where a madman controls the cloned consciousness of his real-life coworkers and torments them endlessly; or the *24/7* issue from *The Sandman*, where a deranged man with supernatural powers traps a group of people in a diner to prove a twisted thesis.

Even *WandaVision* touches on this idea, with Wanda initially acting as the puppeteer of Westview’s residents, who are powerless under her control. I have a deep fascination with these types of stories. They often explore either the mindset of the controller, how they justify or enjoy their domination or thesis they are trying to probe, or the psychological toll on those being controlled.

*Dark* (Netflix) also incorporates this theme, with its characters trapped in a time loop of suffering. Though the controlling force in *Dark* is more abstract compared to the direct antagonists in the previous examples, it still fits within this thematic space.

I’d love more recommendations in this vein, especially those with supernatural elements. In essence, I’m looking for stories where a powerful entity traps a group of people and begins to unravel, dominate, or experiment with them. *The Truman Show* flirts with this idea too, though it takes a more hopeful and lighter approach. thanks in advance",0,1753331881.0,televisionsuggestions,0,0.5,False

1m7uxxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m7uxxx/something_else_on_the_night_shift/,Something Else on the Night Shift,"I work night shifts alone, but something else clocks in with me

You know that feeling when you're the only one in a building? That hum of silence, the echo of your own footsteps? It's weirdly peaceful. That's what I thought, anyway. I took a night shift job as a courier facility supervisor. Nothing glamorous. I sit at a desk, monitor some security feeds, make rounds every two hours. The pay's not bad, and I liked the idea of being alone for a while. No coworkers, no noise. Just me, and the hum.

That was a mistake.

I started two months ago. First few nights, nothing strange. I even brought books to read. The warehouse has four main areas: the loading dock, storage, main hallway, and admin office. Security feeds cycle through them. The cameras are old—grainy black and white, with a bit of lag—but they did the job.

On my ninth night, something changed. It was subtle. Something I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn’t already tired and zoning out. At 2:34 AM, the hallway camera glitched. It only lasted a second. A little blur. But when the feed came back, there was something on the floor. Just a dark smear. I went to check it out.

The hallway smelled wrong. Like burnt copper. And the smear? It looked like something had been dragged**.** But the floor was dry, and no one else was supposed to be here. I checked the entire building. All the doors were still locked. Motion sensors inactive. I wrote it off as a glitch. Maybe a leak. Maybe the night just plays tricks on tired eyes.

But the next night, it happened again. Same time. 2:34 AM. Same blur. This time the smear was longer. Reaching the edge of the hallway, like something was being pulled further each time. I reported it to my supervisor. He looked at the footage, scratched his chin, and said, ""That's been happening for years. Just ignore it."" 

Years. I asked if there was any history to the building. He shrugged. ""All I know is, don't follow it. That's what the last guy did."" I wanted to press him, but he clammed up. I should’ve left then. I should’ve never come back. I did some digging. The last night guard? His name was Jason. Disappeared in 2017. No official word. They said he quit without notice, left all his things behind. Even his lunch was still in the fridge.

I found his locker. Still had his badge inside. And a little notebook. Most of the entries were mundane. ""2:00 AM - Checked loading dock. All clear."" ""2:15 AM - Drank vending machine coffee. Bitter."" But the last few pages? They changed. ""2:34 AM. There it is again."" ""It moved closer. I think it knows I see it."" ""Last night it was at the corner. Tonight, it was at the door. I didn’t open it. I didn’t open it. I won’t."" ""If someone finds this, DON’T LET IT IN.""

The writing got shaky by the end. I took the notebook with me. Showed it to my boss. He told me to destroy it. I didn’t. I don’t think I can. A week later, everything changed. It didn’t wait for 2:34 anymore. The cameras started flickering at random. I'd be watching the loading dock, then static, and suddenly—eyes**.** Right up to the lens. Black, reflective, wet. Gone in a blink. Sometimes I hear breathing in the main hallway. Loud, slow, wet breathing. But when I check the mic feed, there’s nothing.

I started locking the office door. I bring a crowbar now. I don’t feel alone anymore. Two nights ago, I fell asleep on the desk. Only for a minute. When I woke up, someone had written on the monitor in black marker: ""YOU SEE ME."" I checked the cameras. The hallway feed showed a figure—blurry, almost like the lens couldn’t focus on it. Like static had a body.

It was just standing there. Not moving, not blinking. Facing the camera. I watched it for four hours. It didn’t move. At the end of my shift, it was gone. Last night, I found footprints. Black, heavy ones. Leading from the storage area to the office door. My office door. But the cameras showed nothing.

I stayed inside and didn’t breathe. Something brushed the door, slow and deliberate. Like the caress of a hand. Then it stopped. When I opened the door at sunrise, there was another message on the wall. ""TOMORROW."" That’s tonight. I don’t know what to do. I’m sitting in the chair now. It’s almost 2:34 AM. The hallway feed is fine. But my reflection in the screen? It’s smiling. I’m not.

I don’t know what it wants, but I know it’s coming. And I think when it gets here, I won’t be allowed to leave either. Please. If you find this post, don’t take the job. Don’t reply to the listing.

While many people know Miami for its beaches and nightlife, there's so much more that makes this city worth visiting.

The weather is practically perfect year-round, with temperatures usually hovering between 75-85°F. Even during winter, you can comfortably wear shorts and enjoy outdoor activities. This consistent climate is one of the main reasons I fell in love with Miami.

Beyond the famous South Beach scene, Miami's diverse neighborhoods each tell their own story. Little Havana pulses with Cuban culture, offering authentic food and the best Cuban coffee you'll ever taste. Wynwood has transformed from a warehouse district into an open-air art gallery, with stunning murals covering nearly every wall.

But the real hidden gem - and my personal favorite - is the Everglades National Park. It's mind-blowing to have this natural wonder just 45 minutes from downtown Miami. I recently took some friends on an airboat tour at Gator Park, and it was absolutely incredible. The 40-minute ride through the ""River of Grass"" got us up close with alligators, exotic birds, and even turtles sunbathing on logs.

The wildlife show afterward was both entertaining and educational. Watching the alligator handling demonstrations while learning about these fascinating creatures was a highlight for everyone. My friends couldn't stop talking about getting their picture taken with ""Jaws,"" the famous resident gator.

If you're planning to visit, I highly recommend booking the Everglades tour through this link: https://athometouch.com/miami. I've found it to be the best value, starting at $42 per person, and they offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before.

The food scene here is incredibly diverse. From high-end restaurants in Brickell to local food trucks serving Caribbean specialties, there's something for every palate and budget. The fusion of Latin American, Caribbean, and American cuisines creates unique flavors you won't find anywhere else.

Miami's cultural scene is booming too. The Pérez Art Museum, the Frost Science Museum, and countless galleries showcase both local and international talent. During Art Basel in December, the city becomes the global center of the art world.

Transportation is getting better with the Brightline train connecting Miami to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Getting around the city is easier than ever, though I still recommend renting a car if you plan to explore beyond downtown.

Is Miami worth visiting? Absolutely. Whether you're interested in nature, culture, food, or just want to relax on beautiful beaches, Miami offers experiences you won't find anywhere else in the US. Just remember to pack sunscreen and stay hydrated - the Florida sun is no joke!

Pro tip: Visit between November and April for the best weather. Hurricane season (June to November) can be unpredictable, though hotels often offer great deals during this time.

Bottom line: Miami isn't just worth visiting - it's an experience that will leave you planning your next trip before the first one ends.",1,1753331384.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False
1m7uv1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/1m7uv1p/how_i_psyopd_my_brain_into_becoming_the_person_i/,How I psyop’d my brain into becoming the person I used to envy:  reading and gym rewired my reality,"Two years ago I was chronically exhausted, scrolling through TikTok until 2AM, skipping workouts, and saying yes to things I didn’t even want to do. My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins:  It’s not just about toughness, it’s about identity. Goggins literally rewired his brain through action. His “cookie jar” method (collecting proof of your resilience) helped me build confidence from small wins. I used to think I wasn’t built like that. This book showed me I could be.

BeFreed: My friend put me on this smart reading app developed by scientists from Columbia. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, lowkey addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.

Huberman Lab: Dr. Andrew Huberman shares science-backed tips for rewiring your brain for focus, discipline, and energy. His stuff on dopamine and routines changed how I approached mornings. I used his cold exposure + NSDR + gym combo to reset my brain. Best free education on the internet.

Modern Wisdom: Chris Williamson interviews thinkers like Naval, Cal Newport, and Jordan Peterson. His conversations go deep into psychology, self-mastery, and discipline. I listen while lifting or meal prepping, beats music, and I always leave with a mental upgrade.

I used to scroll to escape myself. Now I read to evolve. Changing your life isn’t about forcing discipline. It’s about feeding your brain a new story until it believes it’s true. Once it does, it wants to help you succeed.

Lately, I've been caught up in this feeling... maybe you know it too? It's like being a tiny little speck in this mind-blowingly vast universe and wondering, ""Does my presence here really matter in the grand scheme of things?"" I mean, we've all probably had those days where we feel kinda insignificant, right?

But something hit me the other day while I was sipping my favorite overly complicated coffee order. If every little part of this universe is connected somehow—like how stars are made of the same stuff we're made of—then maybe we're not as alone as we feel. I read somewhere about particles being bound across galaxies or whatever, and it's like, maybe we're part of something bigger that we can't totally see or understand yet.

I don't exactly know where I'm going with this... but I felt like I had to share it with someone, even if it's just the void, or maybe you. There’s a sort of comfort in thinking we’re all threads in this cosmic tapestry—intertwined, in ways obvious and hidden. Does that make any sense? Who knows tho? 🤔

Anyway, thanks for letting me throw this fluttering thought out into the universe. Maybe it lands somewhere, or stays floating, but either way, it feels good to share. Take care, whomever you are.",9,1753331137.0,LettersToStrangers,2,0.92,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1m7uqmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1m7uqmx/end_of_the_line/,"End of the line,","I've been playing TTRPGs since I was 12. I was discovering fantasy fiction, and bonded with my uncle over Terry Pratchett. I played my first one-shot that evening, using the 3.5 starter set. I played Tordek the Dwarf. Tordek kicked a bugbear into a vat of acid. I don't know why I remember that specific detail so well, but it's my first actual memory of TTRPGs.

Visits weren't regular, and my uncle was often working. But I kept asking to play and my uncle would break out the starter set if possible. He called my mum and dads house one evening. As long as I was good and did my homework etc, I could do a little bit of our dungeon game over the phone from time to time. Next time I saw him at his place he gave me a pencil case with a bunch of dice in. And showed me a book with a big scary zombie king on it. He explained to 12 year old me that rather than trying to make an entire adventure fit into a 20 minutes phone call, this story would be a longer one but we were telling it in bits.

My uncle simplified a lot of rules but he did insist I understand my character sheet and try to remember which dice I was supposed to roll for things. I didn't look at Character classes and I never levelled up, I would just acquire new powers and weapons. The rules weren't actually that important But I did learn which dice i rolled to do damage with my lightning sword and I understood my character wasn't good at everything. I had to do some problem solving and it wasn't the DM's job to just grant my wishes and so on.

It took me about 8 months of phone calls and the occasional face to face session. 2 PCs were ""taken prisoner"" and I had to roll a couple of new characters. But eventually I confronted the Zombie king at the heart of underground labyrinth I had learned was named The Lost City of Barakus.

I actually read the module book years later, and realise he just made a lot of stuff up! The dice rolls were correct though.

Sadly my aunt divorced him not long afterwards. I know it's not a wholesome end to the story, but he was a shitty husband. Not a monster or anything, just a bit of a waste of space.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Today I have grown more powerful than deadbeat uncle could possibly imagine!

I love tabletop gaming in general. It's an in group meme that if you are in my home, I will try and get you to play a board game you've never heard of.

I do have other hobbies, but table games are communal activities so that's what I try to get my friends in on. I get a huge kick out of introducing somebody to a board game they really engage with.

But TTRPGs are a passion of a different order. I've been a forever GM for the last ten years and I've loved it. It *is* a lot of work.

But I'm coming to terms with the fact that my best days are behind me when it comes to RPGs. Though a great majority of my stories were unfinished, I have been lucky enough to run 5 campaigns to their proper conclusion. I'm sure others have done better, but that's a decent innings in my eye.

It's not that I will never run a game again, but I have given up on holding a campaign together. I do enjoy short adventures and capers but the development of campaign arcs is what really makes the memories both of the stories told in the fiction and the time spent with friends.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

The last campaign I ran for a decent stretch concluded just over two years ago. A trio of lads from the pub came back to my flat after closing time. The shops were closed and I had a full case of beer, . I had an old campaign notebook open on my coffee table, maps doodles and campaign diaries etc. These guys were not familiar with pen and paper RPGs at all beyond a vague awareness of the brand Dungeons and Dragons.

They're the type of lads who own an Xbox and have 7 games for it. All of those games are Fifa.

Nonetheless, the concept had caught their interest. I was pretty tanked but Ihad some creative energy so I just cobbled some character creation rules together and got to it.

Standard array of 3 4 and 5 assigned to Abilities: Body Mind and Spirit.  
There were 3 general aptitudes under each of those base stats of which they could select two.  
Body: Strength Agility and Constitution  
Mind: Comprehension, Acuity, Retention  
Spirit: Instinct, Will & Presence

I asked if they wanted to do sci-fi or fantasy. They picked Sci fi.  
I said we'll be doing a prison break (my default quickstart coz you can assume their stuff's been taken)  
I asked them all to write 5 interesting things about their characters, and how/why they ended up in prison.  
I determined 3 useful skills and 1 ""dud"" skill  for each of them based on those backgrounds. I felt like a very smart boy when they questioned their dud skills (Cookery, Gardening and Personal Finance, incidentally.) I did the RPG philosophy bit: they'd made characters to roleplay, not game pieces to move about a board, the dud skills were there for character depth and so on

Ability checks were just a case of rolling d6 equal to your basic ability score. If you had a relevant aptitude (like strength for kicking a door down) you got an extra d6. If you had a relevant skill you could set 2 dice to 6 (auto successes, basically.)

After about 2 hours of play they broke out of the prison and stole a transport. They wanted to play on, but I was ready to kick out and assumed they'd forget about it by the morning. Next time I saw Steve he gave me his number to arrange another session. We ended up sticking it out for 20-25 sessions in the end.

The trio became mercenaries for hire and got into all sorts of silly space capers. There wasn't a lot of broader narrative direction but

I developed or added rules only when necessary, and simplicity was the name of the game. They had 10 fuel units, not ""132kg.""  Never bothered with a formal character progression system, they gained ranks in their skills and got an extra basic ability point abouthalf way through and they were happy with that.

I don't mind dense rulebooks. But it was super liberating, not just to have a ruleset so slim, but players who didn't care about how ""good"" the rules were as long as they were applied consistently.

They became known as ""The Black Hole Surfers."" They were interplanetary fuck-not-givers who consistently demonstrated disdain for their fellow citizens. But they were just tough guys in a tough cosmos. This changed when a return client turned out to have massive interests in the Sectors underground lave trade and they went on a bit of a Robin Hood Arc which was actually very character driven. After that their interest started to waver. So I decided a war had started (no foreshadowing for this aside from ""establishment space government bad themes) throughout. The Surfers became reluctant heroes in a revolutionary movement. Big space battle at the end, very derivative and an absolute riot.  I made them shit themselves by breaking out a d10 damage dice for the cannon on the evil space capitalist's flagship. Only non d6 dice rolled in the entire campaign and they rolled a 10 and a 17. The blast wrecked their vessel, so they Kirk manuevered (detonated their main reactor) it at point blank as a final gambit to disable it's shield, which succeeded (on fiat, they rolled dice but I wasn't gonna let them lose now. The revolutionaries asked them to stay and support the revolution, but the Surfers refused. They asked for a small ship for their trouble and headed for the stars.

\-FIN-

Messy plot, paper thin rules, derivative and predictable scenarios, rushed ending

10/10, wouldn't change a thing.

Toward the end of last year I did make a sincere effort to organise a Call of Cthulu group to do an anthology of adventures with  that lasted 6 sessions, four of which I GM'd. After that I'm accepting that I will probably never run an extended campaign again. If I do, it will probably be with my children in the unlikely event we change our mind about not wanting them.

I WAS asked to GM some sessions of Mothership by someone I forgot existed in February. It was pretty out of the blue but I'm glad I was asked because the sessions were fun and the group was easy going and friendly. I highly recommend the RPG itself, easy to pick up and well designed mechanically. Although we were playing over Discord and the whole thing just dissolved. I would have loved to build a proper adventure from the ground up in the system as well.

My OG DnD tablemates are still pretty tight, we're pretty spread out nowadays but we get together on Zoom or Discord a few times a year. We'll sometimes run a oneshot, we mix up the editions and there's lots of inside jokes that date back years, recurring characters and so on. They are fun sessions (even when Charlie gets his way and we play 4th ed.)

My situation is not remarkable, but I wish I'd seen it coming. I feel I should have.

TTRPGs are a high maintenance hobby.

**Affirmations - Why I was such an amazing GM.**

I was an S Tier GM, one of the greats.

That's not just my opinion. I WAS that good.

If you want to find somebody who's played at my table that didn't think it was an awesome experience you'll have to visit the Mirror Universe.

My players got the best the hobby has to offer.

I put effort into the craft and I have brought joy to others through my specific mastery of the craft.

My players never cancelled.

My players arrived early and their phones didn't leave their pockets until I called a break.

My players got invested in the worlds and stories I presented because I presented worlds and stories worth getting invested in.

My players will recall my games fondly in their winter years.

I was asked to run a Mothership campaign by somebody who played in a VTM chronicle I ran on Discord for a bunch of guys I met on Rainbow Six Siege over the Covid years.  
I had literally forgotten he existed, but I believe he got his lo-fi chic space horror RPG and remembered playing my kinda camp gothic vampire action drama campaign from nearly half a decade ago and it stuck with him.

I kept three very unlikely players interested in an off the cuff sci-fi campaign for more then 20 session with a ruleset that would fit on a cocktail napkin. I wouldn't care to bet on if they'll ever play another tabletop RPG, but I am as proud of that campaign as I am any other

This post is not important in any grander scheme.  
Lots of people sacrifice hobbies they don't have time for.  
My experience is not unique, I just want to post some performative melodrama on the internet,  
That's some weapons grade centrifugally concentrated cringe, right there! How dare I be so concieted!  
I should just get over myself and stop spouting pretentious nonsense.

1m7uqh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfcare/comments/1m7uqh6/how_i_psyopd_my_brain_into_becoming_the_person_i/,How I psyop’d my brain into becoming the person I used to envy:  reading and gym rewired my reality,"Two years ago I was chronically exhausted, scrolling through TikTok until 2AM, skipping workouts, and saying yes to things I didn’t even want to do. My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins:  It’s not just about toughness, it’s about identity. Goggins literally rewired his brain through action. His “cookie jar” method (collecting proof of your resilience) helped me build confidence from small wins. I used to think I wasn’t built like that. This book showed me I could be.

BeFreed: My friend put me on this smart reading app developed by scientists from Columbia. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, lowkey addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.

Huberman Lab: Dr. Andrew Huberman shares science-backed tips for rewiring your brain for focus, discipline, and energy. His stuff on dopamine and routines changed how I approached mornings. I used his cold exposure + NSDR + gym combo to reset my brain. Best free education on the internet.

Modern Wisdom: Chris Williamson interviews thinkers like Naval, Cal Newport, and Jordan Peterson. His conversations go deep into psychology, self-mastery, and discipline. I listen while lifting or meal prepping, beats music, and I always leave with a mental upgrade.

I used to scroll to escape myself. Now I read to evolve. Changing your life isn’t about forcing discipline. It’s about feeding your brain a new story until it believes it’s true. Once it does, it wants to help you succeed.
