1jocqel,https://i.redd.it/a3rmknvt03se1.jpeg,What am I doing wrong? 21M,"Hi guys, I‚Äôve (21m) been going to the gym for 3-4 times a week with a protein-rich diet for 6-7 months now. I usually eat peanut butter toast and nuts in the morning, egg bhurji/omelette (3 eggs) and 1 roti for lunch, coffee with a fruit and 2 dates in the evening, and a homemade chicken dish (roasted chicken, chicken curry, palak chicken, etc) with 3-4 chicken pieces with 1 roti for dinner, and some kind of dessert (preferably sugarfree).

Before that, my fitness journey looked something like:
2021-22: lots of cardio, focused on fat loss with no real diet ‚Äòregulation‚Äô just home food
2022-23: started lifting weights (3 days of gym) while increasing eggs
2023-24: no diet regulation apart from calorie counting, 3 days of gym, lots of walking
And now as described in the beginning.

Is there something wrong with my body because I‚Äôve stayed the same physically for the past 2 years? My strength has gone up and down through 2024-25. I used to drink protein shakes for sometime (2023-24) but I stopped, maybe that helped with a little bit of strength though.

Sorry for the long post, feeling really lost and about to consult a sports nutritionist too.

When we first started dating, I didn‚Äôt drink coffee. She has a nice latte machine, and she taught me how to use it so I could make her coffee in the morning, since I usually woke up before her. I didn‚Äôt mind ‚Äî I liked doing it for her, and it made her happy. Eventually, I started making myself a latte too, since I was already making one for her.

The issue came up on the rare occasions she woke up before me. I‚Äôd ask if she could make me a coffee. She would agree, and I‚Äôd be excited ‚Äî but then she‚Äôd make herself a latte, sit and drink it for about an hour, and only then start making mine. She said she couldn‚Äôt make mine until she finished hers because she just didn‚Äôt want to take the extra few minutes right away.

I didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äî when I made coffee for both of us, it took only 2-3 extra minutes to make them at the same time. It felt like she was willing to let me go without or wait an hour just to avoid a couple minutes of effort, even though I regularly made both of ours.

She said I was selfish for expecting her to make mine, and that I only did it for her to get something in return (not true ‚Äî I did it because she asked and seemed to appreciate it). Eventually, she told me she didn‚Äôt even care or appreciate when I made her coffee in the mornings. So I stopped doing it.

She thinks I‚Äôm the asshole because she believes I only made coffee for her with the expectation she‚Äôd return the favor. I think expecting some level of reciprocity in a relationship is reasonable.

So, AITA?

I have applied to many team member/barista and service jobs at Co-op, Starbucks, Lidl, Aldi, Deichmann etc, local coffee shops as well but no luck.

Unfortunately, I don't have previous retail experience as I was an Accounts Assistant but I am very coachable and can learn fast.

I am planning to go to university next year but I'm in desperate need of a job since I have no income and I'm running out of savings.

Could you guys please share some advice on the application process as I've previously never worked in retail so I really don't understand what more can I do to increase my chances to get a job within this industry.

I am looking for both full-time and part-time roles within retail and can commute via TFL for an 1hr - 1hr 30mins. I live in a well connected area with public transport.

I won't accept roles at a pub or roles that deal with alcohol, that's the only line I won't cross.

I've also let my local council know and the most they've done is send me roles to apply for which I've done but I keep getting ghosted. I'll attempt to persuade them to open a new role for me within their office, hopefully it works.

Many thanks UKJobs community, hopefully you guys also find what you're looking for.

He had a ""liberal tears"" coffee mug on his desk at all times and would constantly just say the absolute most inappropriate comments daily. My friends ultimately quit because of how poorly the establishment is run and because of the owners insane behavior.

# Money Diary

**Day 1**

6:45 I wake up, it‚Äôs Monday AND payday. I take my laptop and prepare for my shift in 15 mins.

13:00 My pay comes in! I have some down time so I start dividing the money; this month I get ‚Ç¨5144 due to refunds. This time, I‚Äôm sending some money to pay for grandparents‚Äô rental house and my aunt‚Äôs healthcare (she‚Äôs schizophrenic and stays in a facility). Normally my parents pay for these as in our culture, it is *their responsibility*.

I also send money to my parents and brother. As it‚Äôs my brother‚Äôs birthday soon, I send a bit more. ‚Ç¨1103

Bill from my dentist came in, so I pay ‚Ç¨85. Then, I find out there are some series I want to watch on Netflix, so I sign up, ‚Ç¨14.

I also transfer ‚Ç¨400 to our joint account for monthly bills (‚Ç¨100) and groceries (‚Ç¨300), and ‚Ç¨990 to BF‚Äôs account for mortgage as the direct debit is going out from his account.

17:00 BF gets home, he‚Äôs our main cook, so he starts cooking.

19:30 After dinner and a bit of relaxing, I have a language class that lasts for 90 minutes. I already paid for this all at once for level A0, A1, and A2 for ‚Ç¨860.

Day 1 total = ‚Ç¨2592 (language class excluded)¬†

**Day 2**

4:43 I wake up earlier than my alarm, I start getting ready to go to the office. The train trip is about an hour, plus about 20 minutes walking (or 5 mins walking + 5 mins tram). This morning the tram timing doesn‚Äôt match up, so I just walk. ‚Ç¨9

7:10 Arriving at work 10 minutes late. After an hour of working, I grab some coffee, overnight oats, and croissant from the cafetaria. I eat them while working at my desk, it‚Äôs a busy day.

12:00 My project teammate works from the office too these days, so we go down to the cafetaria together and have some lunch. Today it‚Äôs chicken risotto.

15:00 Finishing my shift, I walk towards the stores nearby and got myself a skin tint. ‚Ç¨43

16:30 I‚Äôm transitting at a bigger station, and grab myself a small burger from the wall because I missed it. Bad cheap food reminds me of college. ‚Ç¨4 + train ‚Ç¨9

17:00 I got home and told BF I‚Äôm not hungry, so he keeps the leftovers for me to have for lunch tomorrow.

Day 2 total = ‚Ç¨65

**Day 3**

7:00 I start work as normal. It is not as busy today, so I start looking up some new clothes as I‚Äôve been trying to move on from my college streetwear look. I spent ‚Ç¨70 for 2 new blouses, and used a ‚Ç¨20 gift card that I got from work.

11:00 I get hungry and eat the leftovers that BF made. Checking my phone, there are 3 direct debits; ‚Ç¨26 for YT premium, ‚Ç¨113 to settle the energy bill from my previous apartment, and ‚Ç¨58 for the gym.

16:00 BF gets home and says he‚Äôs tired; I‚Äôve been wanting sushi so we order some. ‚Ç¨57

20:00 I take a look at a small cinema near us and they have The Brutalist this Friday, so I pay from our joint account ‚Ç¨18. I also order water softener salt which we need to refill every \~2 months, ‚Ç¨39.

Day 3 total = ‚Ç¨247 (Expenses from joint account excluded, already included the full amount (‚Ç¨600) in Day 1)

**Day 4**

4:30 I wake up early again! I guess I don‚Äôt sleep well knowing I have to go to the office haha. This time, I take the train and tram since it‚Äôs colder outside, and there‚Äôs a tram going in 1 minute when I get out of the train station. ‚Ç¨11

8:00 After an hour of working, I smell the croissants and go downstairs to grab my usual breakfast. All the food and drinks in the office are free.

12:00 The bigger team is working from the office so I have a longer lunch break with them. We eat fish curry with rice and it‚Äôs delicious! I get myself a fruity soda and hang out with some colleagues while they smoke. The temperature increased significantly so it is nice and warm.

15:00 I finish work and head straight to the station. I walk instead of taking the tram. The train ticket is ‚Ç¨9.

16:00 In the transit station, I again opt to get a burger, this time from Burger King. This is a treat since where we live, there‚Äôs no big brand junk food and BF is very health conscious. BF will have dinner at a work event so I have to sort out my own dinner anyway, and this is it! ‚Ç¨7

19:30 BF is home and my language class starts once more.

Day 4 total = ‚Ç¨27

**Day 5**

7:00 It‚Äôs Friday but I‚Äôm not feeling the greatest. Beside a slow day and a team meeting, nothing much to take note of. I also nap after work on the couch.

18:00 Dinner is ready thanks to my lovely BF. After dinner, I take a shower.

19:15 We head out to the cinema nearby, and get there exactly at 19:28. It‚Äôs a neighbourhood facility and the movie is arranged by volunteers. Finding out that The Brutalist is a 3,5 hour movie, we leave after the intermission because my headache is getting unbearable and the seats aren‚Äôt comfortable for my tiny stature.

Day 5 total = ‚Ç¨0¬†

**Day 6**

11:00 On Saturday, I sleep in to rest some more, still not feeling great unfortunately. I wake up and get ready as we planned to have a lunch date today.

12:00 I get a crispy chicken poke bowl, and BF got a fancy sandwich. BF pays while I use the restroom, ‚Ç¨50.

13:30 After a nice lunch and conversation, we walk to a nearby clothing store. BF spends ‚Ç¨160 for 2 shirts and I gasped. I earn more than him yes, but I came from a culture where financial security is non-existent. I wonder when I‚Äôll feel secure enough to spend that much at a whim.

14:00 We do our weekly groceries shopping. BF already has his list ready before we departed this morning, so it is fairly quick and easy. He wants to make a homemade pizza so we spend a lot on different cheeses. ‚Ç¨80 (from the joint account).

14:30 We stop by the pick-up point as my blouses are delivered there.

18:00 BF picks up some chicken from the food truck nearby. He goes right as they are closing, so we don‚Äôt get the options we want. BF pays ‚Ç¨10.

Day 6 total = 0 (joint account & BF's spending excluded)

**Day 7**

9:00 We wake up and BF makes me toast. Daylight saving starts so physically I'm still an hour behind.

10:00 Our neighbour comes by, she turns out to be BF‚Äôs distant relative so we spend a long time chatting and sharing stories. She brings some pies from the store, and we serve some coffee and tea.

12:00 We go on a bike ride to bring a lady‚Äôs package that was accidentally sent to me at the pick-up point. She is not home, so her neighbour receives it for her. We return home shortly because it is super windy and not nice for biking, and we make ourselves some instant noodles.

17:00 BF makes homemade pizza. The dough is on the salty end but overall very tasty!

Day 7 total = 0

# Week total

Food + Drink = ‚Ç¨311

Fun / Entertainment = ‚Ç¨40

Home + Health = ‚Ç¨1233

Clothes + Beauty = ‚Ç¨93

Transport = ‚Ç¨38

Other = ‚Ç¨1216

**Reflection**

This is what my week looks like when it‚Äôs pay day, so yes lots of big expenses and the total coming out to ‚Ç¨2931 is indeed HUGE, but there are some things out of the ordinary here for sure like my big family expenditure.

In terms of food, since it's actually also budgeted for the entire month, you can see I'm spending very little on top of it, and this is a drastic change from when I lived alone as I got a lot of takeout and rarely cooked. When travelling to/from work, I try to refrain from getting takeaway coffees since I get coffee for free at work and it's tastier, so I save a lot of money here as well.

In the coming weeks, I plan to take my BF and friends out to restaurants, and this is where my fun money would get used. I find it easier to spend more on food than any other things.

(And yes, BF and I do have joint account but sometimes he insists on paying for things by himself, so I try to return the gesture)

I was hoping this would be a long term rental for me as it is an amazing place to live! It's a 2 bed 2 bath apartment with in unit full size washer and dryer, tons of storage space, vinyl flooring, tile bathrooms, two separate HVAC units, option for fiber internet, and all the amenities you would expect in a high rise apartment building. The unit is a SW facing apartment on the corner right above the southern branch of the Chicago River, with a balcony that lets you see into Wacker drive. It‚Äô‚Äôs also very close to the Illinois Medical District, one of the major reasons I chose this location; currently Harrison is undergoing repairs but when it‚Äôs open you can walk to RUMC within 20 minutes and bike within 10 minutes. The unit is unique as it has enough space next to the balcony to count as a half-en, making for an excellent home office location. It is large enough to fit my full size standing IKEA desk and office chair with plenty of outlets as well. Finally, the apartment is seamlessly integrated with Bilt and there is no service fee for using the Bilt credit card.

Let‚Äôs talk numbers:

Rent is 3,898 per month, monthly utility + service fee: $135 + $7.00 (water, gas, sewage, and trash), power and internet are separate but power I average 100‚Äì150ish monthly with thermostat set to 75F even in winter, and there are many options for internet, including ATT fiber, cable (Xfinity) and microwave internet (Google Webpass or Zentro).

Parking is optional but is 350 monthly, covered but with windows for ventilation. It‚Äôs cold in the winter but many people warm up their cars while getting ready in the morning. They spray down the parking spots every spring to clean up all the detritus from winter driving.

Amenities:

Gym with real squat rack and bench press, as well as cross-fit and yoga rooms, outdoor pool with rent-able cabanas (closed during winter), in room package deliver or package room as preferred, free printing and coffees (10 pages and 10 coffees per month), 8^(th) floor has dining room, media room, game room with virtual golf and archer, as well as several gas grills for BBQs facing the Chicago river. The lot to the north of the apartment is for planned future developments, but for now acts as a large dog park. There is also an excellent bike storage room with included bike cleaning station with hot water and separate ground level entrance, which I use all the time for commuting and shopping.

Moving is very easy as there is a loading dock situated right next to a reservable elevator.

Besides having an excellent view of the south branch of the Chicago River, the apartment is also walking distance from Grant park

Floor plan:

[https://thereedapts.com/floor-plans](https://thereedapts.com/floor-plans)

The apartment is unit 2B, importantly with two full baths, one with a standard bathtub shower and the other as a walk in shower.

Dates:

Sublease would start July 1^(st) 2025 and extend to end of lease on 10/17/25, making for a perfect Summer least at 3.5 months duration, of course with the option to renew at end of lease. This would make for an excellent trial period to enjoy living downtown without locking into a 12 month lease immediately.

Me and my girlfriend‚Äîtogether 3.5 years‚Äî living together - hit a wall this week in Mexico. Wednesday started great‚Äîan hour before it blew up, we were talking engagement, kids, our future‚Äîfelt solid. Then midday, I was drinking more. At a bar, paying the bill with her sister‚Äôs fianc√©‚Äîfuture brother-in-law‚Äîhe told me something private about their sex life. He shouldn‚Äôt have, but I took it and later, in line outside a restaurant, made a rude joke about it to her sister‚Äîmade her really uncomfortable. She stormed off, came back five minutes later, yelled at me in the street‚Äîshe had every right. I apologized three times. Still in line, my girlfriend made a comment about our sex life‚Äîapologized later on the balcony, but it set me off. I said offside stuff like ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre staying at my family‚Äôs place‚Äô and ‚ÄòYou three should be on a flight tomorrow‚Äô‚Äîuncalled for. I left the line, went to another bar alone, kept drinking‚Äîno one ended up at dinner. Her fianc√© came to talk‚ÄîI was drunk, told him about a personal health issue of hers affecting our sex life, explaining why her comment triggered me. Felt I could share‚Äîdidn‚Äôt see it wrong then. Her sister had run upstairs crying before that, called their mom saying we disrespected her. Then came down to the bar, said my girlfriend was missing‚Äîno context. Didn‚Äôt know ‚Äòtil later she was calling her mom, trying to explain for me. It escalated‚Äîmy girlfriend came back; they were in the pool. Sister kept bugging about her bathing suit top‚Äîpetty to me with bigger issues. I kept escalating‚Äîwent down, they were gone getting everyone food for a while. I lay in bed; they returned, assumed I was asleep, closed my door. I was being immature‚Äîread the door closing as more than it was‚Äîwent upstairs to the pool alone, causing drama. Girlfriend came up‚Äîstill stubborn, pissed her off, she went down. Her sister got my dad from another condo, asked to switch rooms‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt comfortable with me. He said no, he‚Äôd talk to me first, came up, asked what‚Äôs going on. I didn‚Äôt know how he knew‚Äîadded to my anger.

Went back down, confronted them‚Äîhostile, unresolved. Sister and I agreed to be good, tomorrow‚Äôs new‚Äîstill mad, said it. Needed to finish the fight with my girlfriend on the balcony‚Äîjust yelling, mostly me, grasping at straws, no control over my anger, saying stuff I shouldn‚Äôt have, no defusing. Her sister packed their stuff, took her away. Thursday morning, hotel talk‚Äîthought it was good, said ‚ÄòI love you,‚Äô hugged, teared up, agreed no rash decisions, talk at home. I left; she stayed with her sister. Thursday afternoon, texted‚Äîsaid I‚Äôm sorry, we‚Äôre stronger, I love her‚Äîshe texted back, said she‚Äôs sad, ‚ÄòI will always love you,‚Äô we‚Äôd talk when back. Friday, nothing from her. Saturday, she sent flight info‚Äîno ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô back. We both got home Saturday night‚Äîplanned to hug her, say ‚ÄòI‚Äôve missed you‚Äîyou‚Äôre my person,‚Äô fight for us. Walked in‚Äîno hug. She said I betrayed her trust, telling her fianc√© about her health issue‚Äî‚Äòmore than she could imagine.‚Äô Never thought her partner would do that, so angry she doesn‚Äôt know if she loves me or wants to work on this. Said she woke up Friday so angry, only looking back on bad things, couldn‚Äôt think of any good stuff. Didn‚Äôt understand why I could give her a good hug Thursday at the hotel but pull away or joke other times. Asked for more space to think. Also mentioned she was mad I reached out and talked to a mutual friend, mostly her friend. In the moment, I needed someone to talk too. Looking back, I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done that. In the moment it felt like the only person who knew all 3 of us that would be able to help me understand.

I admitted I didn‚Äôt see how her always asking for physical touch and me not giving it hurt her ‚Äòtil then. Told her I see my faults in that now, especially wanting it from her, and how my stubbornness in fights‚Äînot taking responsibility, not defusing‚Äîhurt her too. Said I‚Äôm more to blame than I‚Äôve owned before, I see it all now, and I‚Äôm done with empty promises‚ÄîI want to put in the work. But her sister‚Äôs completely done with me, called their parents to arrange a hotel‚Äînow they‚Äôre beyond angry at me. She doesn‚Äôt see a future if they all hate me‚Äîshe‚Äôs stuck between them and me. I kept saying it‚Äôs us first, we can fix us then work on the rest together, but she‚Äôs hung up on the betrayal and her family mess. Last night‚ÄîSaturday‚Äîwe were in separate bedrooms; I barely slept. Said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry‚ÄîI love you,‚Äô left it. This morning, Sunday, March 30, she was up‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt bring up space, just talked small stuff in person: ‚ÄòNeed anything?‚Äô Made her breakfast, kept it light. She‚Äôs so close to ending it; I‚Äôm thrown. Never thought she‚Äôd doubt us‚ÄîI‚Äôve hurt her worse than I realized, losing control, joking about his stuff, spilling hers to him. Scared she‚Äôs pulling away for good.

Sat with her for about 20 mins on her bed before this. Was able to have small conversations about her week. Still very reserved. Said I would get stuff for the week dinners and she said she would figure it out and I didnt have too. Felt like very very small progress but progress none the less. Still wanted to maybe to go up to our hometown about an hour away on the weekend. I asked if she would still be going if it wasn‚Äôt for this and she said no. Would only be her dad there. Ended up sitting with me at dinner but she didn‚Äôt speak. I asked some very surface level questions and got basic answers back.

She ended up coming to say she was going to bed last night instead of just going to bed without saying anything. I apologized again. Left her a note on her coffee cup this morning. Apologizing for making her feel sad and angry. Told her to have a good day and week at work and that I love her. She ended up texted me at work thanking me for the note and letting me know when she would be home. Feels like very very small progress, but progress none the less.

TL;DR : I fucked up. I broke her trust on something. But she knows I‚Äôm not a bad guy. I‚Äôve never betrayed her trust before. I‚Äôve never let something get to this. I want to fix this relationship. She‚Äôs my person.",1,1743451011.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

yesterday we were there, i got her and me some coffee.

we just started talking and got to know each other some more.

she felt that I was very nervous and gently separated my hands from the coffee and said ""dont do that"" but not in a condescending way.

Then told me to just breathe in and out.

  
Finally, she asked me why I asked her to come in the first time.

She was cold so we went inside and sat down.

Then I got very nervous because I was going to confess, she did the aforementioned things again.

After that, she said that she had suspected it, and told me that I was brave and cute but that she wasn't looking for a relationship rn.

It‚Äôs me again, your friendly neighborhood Factorio Codex Dev, here to share what I‚Äôve been up to lately. I‚Äôm excited to unveil a fresh round of updates that I‚Äôve poured a ton of work (and coffee) into.

Previous Updates: 

[Factory Search ](https://www.factoriocodex.com/factory-search)\- (Not a standard blueprint search) Check out my unique take on finding factories by searching within books to find which factory is making what YOU need!  

# My Latest Improvements

# 1. Better Recipe Capability üç≥

I spent a lot of time refactoring how the site parses and calculates recipes. Now, when you view a factory build, you‚Äôll see even more accurate input/output calculations, factoring in modules, beacons, and quality levels (more on that below). It should be a lot easier to find exactly the build that fits your production needs without any guesswork.

# 2. Bigger & Better Renders üèóÔ∏è

Large blueprint? No problem! I updated the built-in rendering system to handle truly huge builds. Zoom in on complicated megabases or giant blueprint books without squinting‚Äîevery detail should be crystal clear, with easy click-to-zoom functionality.

# 3. Module, Beacon & Quality Support üîß

The big feature I‚Äôm most proud of: Factorio Codex now fully supports beacons, modules, and quality levels when calculating production. If you pack your assemblers with Productivity Modules, or go for max speed with beacons plastered all around, the website will estimate throughput for every sub-factory in your blueprint.  No more messing with complicated spreadsheets. 

https://preview.redd.it/s0fe5iiqu2se1.png?width=2282&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a7b25e74158bc8d9b297204224515a89d2f96a1

https://preview.redd.it/n1eu8x45v2se1.png?width=2281&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0198fc530533c31445d1cc539de88d9aad8b1e5

# Beacon Distance for Per-Building Coverage

I‚Äôve also tackled the challenge of figuring out exactly which buildings get beacon effects. Factorio uses a square coverage area around each beacon, and Factorio Codex now mirrors that by using something called **Chebyshev Distance** behind the scenes. In simpler terms, it just checks if a building is close enough (in a square radius) to benefit from the beacon‚Äôs modules.

The result? **No more guesswork** about which assemblers actually get the speed or productivity boosts. Factorio Codex does all the range checks for you automatically, so you can focus on building smarter, not fiddling with math.

# Keep the Feedback Coming!

* I‚Äôd love to hear about any quirks or edge cases you discover.
* Missing some icons? I‚Äôm on it!

# Design Philosophy üéØ

My goal with Factorio Codex is simple: **help you find not just random blueprints, but the exact factory you need**‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just one piece of a giant blueprint book. Every sub-factory is broken down with precise inputs, outputs, resource requirements, and production rates (including those shiny new beacons, modules, and quality levels). That way, you can drop a perfect smelting setup or circuit build right into your base without rummaging through an entire megabase blueprint.

Enjoy, and let me know how it goes. Construct faster, produce more, and keep that feedback flowing!

I‚Äôm very proud of what I have so far, but what love to know what I can improve and if there‚Äôs anything I should add. Here‚Äôs a quick blurb about The Havoc Society:

Isadora Sorenson is the daughter of a powerful dictator named Isaiah, better known to many as the Grand Master Triumphant of the Pacantic Union. He rules under the idea that total world peace can be achieved by removing all individuality and forcing everyone to conform to one mindset. His ways of enforcing this have become increasingly brutal, and Isadora, albeit only 15 years old, is determined to stop him.

Behind the scenes, Isaiah has been developing time travel technology that he plans to use to spread his influence. Isadora steals it and hopes to use it to change her father‚Äôs past and make it so he never came to power. She recruits the help of six other teens who knew Isaiah throughout his life, including Isaiah‚Äôs coworker and high school friend Sherman, and a young boy named Viktor who was punished by Isaiah in one of his schools. As they travel through Isaiah‚Äôs life and try to unravel what made him the way he is, they learn things about themselves that blow apart their worldview and change everything they thought they knew. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 

The story is told from the alternating perspectives of both Sherman and Viktor. There is abuse of power, forbidden love, found family, action, tearful moments, and just a lot of compelling and complex elements that weave all the pieces together.

Here are the first few pages for anyone interested:

 	There is a certain behavior expected of people who visit small town diners. For example, the patrons must drink every drop of the coffee, even if it is just mediocre, and the waiters must smile at all times, even on days when their dog has just died. Customers must always leave a large gratuity, even if they watched the cook mix an enormous wad of phlegm into their Eggs Benedict before it was brought to their table. And of course, the ambiance of the place always includes the constant yelling of the manager from the back of the kitchen, and everyone just accepts that.
The young waiter at The Rusty Nail had not recently lost his dog, nor had he been berated yet by any higher-ups that morning, but he still found it difficult to force a smile as he carried a tray of steaming food to the table of a man in a well-worn tweed jacket and a wide-brimmed straw hat that obscured most of his face. 
‚ÄúYour coffee‚Äù, the young man set a faded mug down in front of the gentleman, who made no movement, ‚Äúand Eggs Benedict‚Äù. The Hollandaise sauce, clearly undercooked, sloshed over the side of the plate as he placed it next to the mug.
The man at the table nodded politely, the bristles of a sandy moustache appearing beneath his bowed head. The waiter, expecting no further conversation from the patron who had been nothing but silent thus far, tucked his tray under his arm and turned on his heel towards the kitchen. 
The diner had only just opened for the day, and was not expected to be busy for another hour, and so the young waiter slipped off the wrinkled paper hat he was required to wear and leaned back against the door of a walk-in refrigerator, finally letting the strained smile fall from his face. The only other employee there was a fellow teenager, this one a shorter and thinner than the first, who was spreading hash browns in a sizzling pan. 
 ‚ÄúD‚Äôya see that man out there?‚Äù the first boy motioned to his coworker, who turned his back on the potatoes just long enough to see the straw-hat man take a long sip of his coffee, shake his head, and pull a small black notebook out of his jacket pocket, which he immediately began scribbling in. 
‚ÄúWhat is he, a food critic?‚Äù the second boy asked, his brows furrowed. 
 The first boy wrung his hands together, never taking his gaze off the straw-hat man. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt talk to me. He wrote his order down on a piece of paper and handed it to me. I have yet to see his eyes‚Äù
‚ÄúMaybe he doesn‚Äôt speak English well,‚Äù the second boy suggested, ‚ÄúOr he‚Äôs sick and knows you‚Äôll hear it in his voice.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúOr maybe he‚Äôs a spy,‚Äù the first boy remarked, which made his coworker burst into a fit of giggles.
‚ÄúA spy for whom?‚Äù he laughed,tears brimming in his eyes, ‚Äúsome evil government agency trying to get two 16-year-old waiters to join their cause?‚Äù 
 The first boy laughed too, but his was more labored. He rubbed the back of his neck, ‚ÄúYeah, that would be crazy.‚Äù

The standard 200mg dose does nothing, 400mg does little, one day I just filled an 00 capsule completely and...wow all anxiety and agoraphobia vanished completely. It also means if I go out and I have an extra coffee or something like that, it balances the caffeine out so I don't get overstimulated, which is handy.

Years later it's actually started fixing my anxiety disorder because I notice after an event or comittment I had no anxiety then realize I forgot to take the l-theanine which is great news. I still prefer taking it because it's very pro social as long as diet/exercise/no alcohol etc are strictly followed. I also take taurine but notice nothing from it.

Anyway as l-theanine and taurine [increases levels of GABA in the CNS](https://old.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/j64k36/thoughts_on_gaba/g7x37ti/), **does one need to supplement GABA to replace the GABA used in the CNS?**

1jobwx9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jobwx9,Help me - where should the seating go in our 100-year old sunroom?,"Hi, I've been scratching my head regarding layout options for our sunroom that we are soon getting rebuilt. It's a pretty compact L-shaped lean-to that wraps around our living room, with some narrow French doors to the interior. A large sliding door opens on to the garden. We don't really use the space ""around the corner' except for storage and currently just have a couple of IKEA Poang armchairs and a coffee table looking out to the garden. However, because the space is a bit shallow, the flow doesn't feel great - it's like you're always manoeuvring round the armchairs.

It's an original sunroom from the 1920s so although we're having it reconstructed because the timbers are rotting, we're not changing any dimensions or the general style.

Any suggestions would be very welcome. I've thought about a corner sofa in the bottom left corner - but it feels odd to not be facing out to the garden. My other idea was for a small 2-seater sofa on the right hand wall, but I think it's almost certainly too tight and will mean the French doors can't fully open on one side. We don't want to go for a more upright style of chair to save on space in the current location as it's a place we like to kick back and relax in. Ideally we'd be getting some kind of footstools in the mix for even more lazing!

It happened just last Saturday. In the morning, we went to the She Slays convention at One Ayala to check some of the booths and try to claim the press-on nails I won. It was nice and we even had coffee after. After a while of walking around, my ankle started hurting, so like the caring person my gf is, she insisted on going home so I could rest. Otw back, I mentioned going to MCS to have one of my clothes altered since it didn't really fit me right. They said yes so we agreed to go there later in the afternoon. We even agreed to going at a sapphic bar that we've been wanting to try since it's within the area anyway.

Kaso lang we took a massive nap because of how tired we were hahaha. She woke up first and I heard them say that they already signed us up for the sapphic bar event, and that I should receive an email regarding the payment. I was still sleepy and thinking of not wanting to push through na, but since they already paid their share, I decided to do it too. The payment took a lot of steps so because I just woke up, I started getting grumpy and whiny about it. My girlfriend tried to be understanding, but after hearing my whining for a while, I guess they started feeling upset or grumpy too.

When I finally came to my senses (because I was already fully awake), I apologized to my gf but she was not budging huhu. Even when I tried to be cute, they were still mad while preparing to go out.

Now for the silly moment. For context, ever since my partner and I started living together, they always ask me to do their makeup‚Äîfor dates, work, etc. So even while they were being grumpy that time, when they grabbed their kit, I was prepared to do their makeup. But then they wouldn't let me. After some attempts, I resigned and just watched them while pouting haha. Well, until they started putting their concealer then proceeded to grab the wrong brush. I didn't hesitate to say, ""Not that brush."" They were still not happy, but they went to get a different one and showed it to me. After that, they finally faced me and gave the brush to me, allowing me to do their makeup. SO ADORABLE.

Anyway, I apologized for the way I acted, and they forgave me. They even asked for litol kisses while I was doing their makeup. Hihi.

The clock ticked softly in Dipper‚Äôs room. The summer of mystery and chaos had come to an end, and the Pines twins were finally back in their normal home, in their normal town, where things were supposed to be... well, normal.

Except, neither of them felt normal.

Mabel sat beside Dipper‚Äôs bed, her sock-covered feet swinging idly. Her arms were wrapped around Waddles, who had somehow managed to gain even more weight since they got back.

""Man, this summer was wild,"" Mabel said, breaking the silence. ""I mean, demon overlords, time travel, Stan being‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the word?‚Äîcompetent for once?""

Dipper smirked. ""I know, right? And to think, just a few months ago, our biggest worry was whether Soos would accidentally eat the Mystery Shack‚Äôs supply of wax figures again.""

Mabel grinned. ""RIP, Wax Larry King. You were too pure for this world.""

They both chuckled before falling silent again, the weight of their memories settling in.

""Hey, Dip?"" Mabel asked after a moment.

""Yeah?""

She hesitated. ""Do you think we‚Äôll ever go back?""

Dipper blinked, glancing at his sister. ""To Gravity Falls?""

Mabel nodded.

Dipper leaned back, folding his arms behind his head. ""Yeah. I mean, of course. We promised everyone we‚Äôd visit next summer.""

""But what if something happens? What if we get too busy? What if‚Äî""

""Mabel,"" Dipper interrupted, sitting up and smiling softly.

""No matter what happens, you‚Äôll always be my sister, Mabel.""

Mabel beamed. ""Pfft, duh! We‚Äôre twins, bro-bro. We‚Äôre stuck together forever.""

Dipper placed a hand on his chest. ""If you ever feel lost, just remember‚Äîyour heart will always tell you who you really are.""

Mabel stared at him for a moment before bursting into laughter. ""That‚Äôs so cheesy!""

Dipper chuckled. ""Yeah, but it‚Äôs true.""

The two of them dissolved into laughter, falling over on the bed, Waddles grunting in protest as Mabel squished him between them.

It was a moment of pure Pines sibling energy‚Äîequal parts heartwarming and ridiculous.

Ten years later ‚Äì 2022

The sound of a door slamming open echoed through the Pines household.

""I SWEAR TO ALL THAT IS HOLY, IF ONE MORE KAREN ASKS ME WHY HER DAMN ICED COFFEE IS COLD‚Äî""

""Dip, buddy, calm down,"" Mabel wheezed, following behind him, struggling to kick off her sneakers. ""Your face is so red it‚Äôs gonna explode like a tomato on steroids.""

Dipper threw his work apron onto the couch like it had personally offended him. ""NO, I WILL NOT CALM DOWN! You were there, Mabel! You SAW her! She looked me in the eyes and said‚ÄîAND I QUOTE‚Äî‚ÄòWhy is my ice coffee cold?‚Äô""

Mabel snorted. ""To be fair, Dip, you did pause for a solid ten seconds like you were rebooting.""

Dipper ran a hand through his now slightly longer hair, groaning. ""I just‚Äîhow? How do people like that exist? And WHY do they always find me?!""

Mabel collapsed onto the couch, sprawling out dramatically. ""At least you didn‚Äôt have to deal with my Karen. This lady deadass tried to RETURN a half-eaten sandwich because, and I quote, ‚Äòit didn‚Äôt taste like the picture.‚Äô""

Dipper stared at her. ""That‚Ä¶ that physically hurts me.""

""Oh, it gets worse, broseph."" Mabel sat up, eyes wide. ""When I told her we don‚Äôt do refunds on half-eaten food, she LICKED IT IN FRONT OF ME and said, ‚ÄòNow it‚Äôs whole again. Can I get my money back now?‚Äô""

Dipper threw himself face-first onto the couch. ""Humanity was a mistake.""

Mabel patted his back. ""There, there, bro-bro. One day, we‚Äôll escape the food service industry and live out our dreams.""

Dipper lifted his head slightly. ""My dream is to be left alone in a forest with a good book.""

Mabel grinned. ""And mine is to marry a handsome lumberjack and run a glitter-themed bakery!""

Dipper squinted at her. ""That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ oddly specific.""

""Hey, a girl‚Äôs gotta have goals.""

Silence settled between them for a moment before Dipper sighed. ""I can‚Äôt believe we almost got fired today.""

Mabel cackled. ""Dude, we so almost got fired today.""

""Like, 99% fired.""

Mabel stood up, stretching. ""Welp, I‚Äôm calling it. I need my beauty sleep.""

Dipper smirked. ""That implies you ever wake up beautiful.""

Mabel gasped dramatically, clutching her heart. ""How dare you?! I am a majestic unicorn disguised as a human!""

Dipper rolled his eyes. ""Sure, Mabel.""

She pointed at him. ""Your negativity is toxic, and I‚Äôm cutting you out of my life. Good night, Dipshit.""

Dipper snorted. ""Good night, Mabel.""

She wiggled her fingers at him in a fake mystical gesture. ""May your dreams be filled with Karen-free joy.""

Dipper groaned. ""Now I‚Äôm gonna dream about that stupid iced coffee lady.""

Mabel grinned wickedly. ""Cold as ice, Dip. Cold as ice.""

And with that, she disappeared into her room, leaving Dipper shaking his head as he entered his own.

Before he shut the door, he smiled to himself.

No matter how crazy life got, some things never changed.

10:20 PM ‚Äì The Pines Household

Dipper was deep in sleep, dreaming of something actually peaceful for once‚Äîlike reading in a quiet library, with no monsters, no cryptids, and certainly no insane coffee customers. It was beautiful. Serene.

Then‚Äî

""DIPPER! DIP-DIP-DIP-DIP-DIP-DIP‚Äî""

Dipper groaned as he was violently shaken awake by none other than his twin sister, Mabel.

""Mabel, what the‚Äî?!"" He cracked open one eye, squinting at her in the dim room. ""It is LITERALLY the middle of the night! Why are you here?! Why are you like this?!""

Mabel, unbothered, shoved her laptop in his face. ""Someone called me! Like, mysteriously! Like, ‚Äòooooh, spooky!‚Äô"" She wiggled her fingers dramatically.

Dipper groaned, rubbing his face. ""Mabel, you answered a mystery call? Have we learned NOTHING from the countless times that has gone horribly wrong?""

""It‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs probably not a supernatural death curse. Now, watch!""

She plopped onto his bed, opening the laptop. Static filled the screen. A glitchy figure flickered in and out, mumbling in garbled, robotic noises.

Dipper squinted at the screen. ""If this is one of Soos‚Äôs weird meme videos again, I swear‚Äî""

Then, the image cleared.

A familiar six-fingered hand pressed against the screen.

A face appeared.

""Grunkle Ford?!"" Dipper and Mabel shouted in unison.

Ford grinned. ""Ah-ha! I finally got through! Good, good! You both look‚Ä¶ older! My word, has it been ten years already?""

Mabel gasped. ""Oh my gosh, Ford, have YOU gotten older?! Are you, like, mega old now?! Are you growing a wizard beard?!""

Ford chuckled. ""Mabel, I was already old when you met me. But no wizard beard, though I have considered an eyepatch for dramatic effect.""

Dipper rubbed his eyes, still processing everything. ""Wait, hold on. Why are you calling now? And how? This laptop is older than our jobs combined.""

Ford smirked. ""Oh, a bit of interdimensional technology tinkering, no big deal. But the real reason I‚Äôm calling‚Äî""

He leaned closer, lowering his voice. ""Stan and I miss you both. A lot. And we thought, why not invite you back for a visit?""

Dipper and Mabel‚Äôs eyes widened.

Ford continued, ""Gravity Falls isn‚Äôt quite the same without you two. We thought, what better way to fix that than by having you come back for another summer?""

Mabel gasped dramatically, gripping Dipper‚Äôs shoulders. ""DIPPER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. WE HAVE TO GO BACK.""

Dipper blinked. ""I mean‚Ä¶ yeah. We do have a lot of vacation days saved up.""

""Screw vacation days! This is DESTINY!"" Mabel spun dramatically, pointing at the screen. ""Ford, tell Grunkle Stan we‚Äôll be there faster than you can say ‚Äòillegal government experiments‚Äô!""

Ford laughed. ""I‚Äôll let him know. Get ready for an adventure, kids.""

With that, the call ended.

The twins stared at the now-dark screen, then slowly turned to each other.

A grin spread across Mabel‚Äôs face.

""DIPPER, WE‚ÄôRE GOING HOME!""

Dipper smirked. ""Yeah, Mabel. We are.""

The next morning, the Pines twins packed their things with frightening enthusiasm. Clothes? Check. Snacks? Check. Waddles? Extra check.

Mabel dramatically lifted Waddles into the air like Simba. ""My beautiful pig baby, we are going home!""

Waddles oinked in confusion, clearly unaware of the momentous occasion.

Dipper struggled with stuffing their luggage into the car. ""Okay, do we really need four suitcases? We‚Äôre only going for a summer!""

Mabel gasped. ""Excuse you, fashion is a necessity, Dipper! And also, I packed emergency costumes in case we need to go undercover.""

Dipper pinched the bridge of his nose. ""I don‚Äôt even wanna know.""

After much struggling (and Mabel somehow sneaking in a fifth bag), they were finally ready.

Dipper slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, adjusting his glasses. Mabel hopped into the passenger seat, clutching Waddles like a prized trophy.

With a rev of the engine, they pulled out of the driveway.

Mabel grinned. ""Next stop: Gravity Falls!""

Dipper smiled, feeling a familiar excitement bubbling in his chest. ""Yep. Here we go again.""

Meanwhile‚Ä¶ Elsewhere‚Ä¶

A monitor flickered to life in a dark room, showing Dipper‚Äôs car driving down the road.

A shadowed figure leaned forward, watching.

Behind him, another figure stepped out from the shadows, face hidden in the dim light. He was wearing a long trench coat, his stance firm.

The first figure spoke, voice low. ""It‚Äôs time.""

The man in the trench coat turned toward the exit and walked away, his silhouette vanishing into the darkness.

After a moment, a third figure emerged, arms crossed.

""Are you sure he can handle this?"" he asked.

The first figure didn‚Äôt look away from the monitor. ""If Dipper and Mabel are really in danger‚Ä¶ he can protect them.""

The screen flickered again, showing their car disappearing into the distance.

1jobsf5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jobsf5,Visual: The difference a high clarity grinder actually makes‚Ä¶,"You often see folks in this sub talking about one grinder or being better/clearer than another, particular size distribution, fines, etc - but for most it‚Äôs hard to grok the true difference. 

To visually highlight this for everyone, I‚Äôve taken the same coffee (Prodigal EL MIRADOR Junguilla Gesha) and ground it with a 1ZPRESSO K-Ultra (first photo) and a Pietro with Pro Brew burrs (second photo). I‚Äôve used as close to similar grind settings as possible between the two, then intentionally went two clicks finer on the Pietro to try to give it a further disadvantage over the slightly coarser K-Ultra. This is ~75 microns finer than I‚Äôd typically use for the Pietro, so my normal post-brew Pietro filters look even cleaner. 

Both were brewed in the same manner, temp, etc - and with the same type of filter. 

I think the visual speaks for itself. The substantially fewer fines with the Pietro, despite it being a finer grind make for a MUCH clearer cup. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the K-Ultra offers decent clarity and is a superb grinder - but once you season the burrs - the Pietro is really something special. 

Hopefully this can help visually illustrate what a substantial difference a grinder can make. I do wish I had done a third example with my EK43 before I sold it - but I owned it for more than a decade (it has the highly regarded pre-2015 burrs) - but I found the difference visually on a filter like above was almost indistinguishable from the Pietro, and the flavor in cup although a bit different, offered no appreciable gains in flavor separation or clarity. While I loved the EK43 and it served me well, I like the slightly more acidic zing from the Pietro more (personal preference), and it takes up way less counter space and makes zero mess, unlike the EK43. 

Bottom line: high clarity grinders make a big difference - and I‚Äôd strongly recommend the Pietro. It offers unmatched clarity at its price point, and frankly is better than many grinders 6X its cost. As long as you keep the grinder lubricated (a small amount of silicone grease) and have the accessory kit to have the stability base - the workflow is totally acceptable. It‚Äôs still not as fast/easy to use as a 1ZPRESSO - but it‚Äôs not unpleasant in any way. Of course there‚Äôs always the ZP6 at less than 1/2 the cost - but having had cups from several ZP6‚Äôs, I do think it‚Äôs worth spending the extra $ to bump up to the Pietro. 

One heads up, since the burrs are coated and are allegedly 5X harder than their standard burrs (which gives the burrs a ridiculous wear rating of thousands of kilos) - it takes a really long time to season these burrs, so you have to be pretty patient with it. It takes quite some time before you really experience the Pietro‚Äôs excellence. ",10,1743449358.0,pourover,7,0.78,False

But why do so many people tell their really young kids ""hey hit zero to call front desk and ask for X"". I've had a LOT of rooms calling me this winter season that were kids as young as like 5-6 calling me up.

Tiny child: ""Hello...um.....this is....um....[last name]....um.....in um.....(turns away) What's our room number?""

Me: ""I can see your room number, honey, what do you need?""

Tiny child: ""Um...we need........uhh.....(turns away again) How many towels do we need? (turns back to phone) We need some towels.""

Me, knowing full well I'm about to ask the question that will ruin my night: ""Okay, what kind of towels do you need and how many?""

Tiny child, who is barely audible over their other family members and the loud TV in the background, so now I have also been gifted The Sense of Dread of an upcoming noise complaint: ""Uhhhh.......(turns away again) How many? .......(long pause while I hear vague mumbling in the background)..........Five towels.""

Me, looking longingly back to my Steam Deck and coffee sitting on the desk behind me, abandoned, waiting for my eventual return like a fish wife waiting for her husband to return from The Voyage: ""What kind, sweetie? The big ones?""

Tiny child, probably distracted by picking their nose and eating it: ""Uhhh........""

Queue me multiple times having to ask if they need any of our various kinds of towels, because I know full well that if I do not bring six face towels as though I were supposed to somehow glean this from what their kid was telling me they will come down on me like the wrath of a dying vengeful God, and that if I ask the kid to just put the adult on the line the adult will address me as though I barged into their house with a SWAT team, knocked Nana's ashes off the mantle, started going through their jewelry cabinet, and demanded their social security numbers.

It started when I bought my house around 5 months ago.¬†

The first few days I moved in, everything seemed normal. Well, everything except for the busted air conditioning, but that‚Äôs beside the point.¬†

It was round the end of the second week of living there that it started happening.

The morning of the first gift, I had gotten out of bed and got going as usual. I got out of bed, fed my cat Misty, and had started my coffee when I noticed a small package on my coffee table.

It was wrapped in plain white paper with a small sage-green ribbon tied neatly around it.

Shocked, I looked all around for the person who had left it. I searched in closets, under my bed and guest bed, even going as far as to check the air ducts. Nothing. No one. I knew it couldn't be any of my friends, nor my parents, as none of them had the code to my front door.¬†

Not wanting to touch it, I got dressed and walked to the cafe down the street, where I‚Äôve been working as a barista for 4 years.

I worked my long 8 hour shift, forgetting all about the package as I talked to my favorite regulars about their grandchildren, how their dog was doing, etc.

When the day was over, I walked back home.

Walking through the front door, that‚Äôs when I saw it again. The package.

It was still sitting in the middle of the coffee table where I had left it, except now, there was a small notecard laying next to it. It read ‚Äú*open me*‚Äù in the prettiest cursive I have ever seen.

Picking up the notecard first, I turned it over to see if there was more writing on the pack of it. Nope. I put the card down and picked up the package.

Untying the bow and unwrapping the neatly folded paper, I unveiled a small black box. I took the top off of the box and saw a small pendant, like one you would wear on a necklace.

It was pure metal with a very detailed flower on it. It looked like a lotus.¬†

Turning it over in my hand, I tried to think about who would have left me something like that, and more importantly, how they got into my house during the night.¬†

I placed the pendant back into the box and left it on the coffee table, ignoring it as I went to the kitchen to heat up some leftover spaghetti.¬†

While my food was in the microwave, I texted my best friend to tell her about the package, but her being boy crazy and delusional, she came up with the idea that maybe I had a secret admirer. I just rolled my eyes and decided not to tell anyone else.¬†*It‚Äôs no cause for concern, it‚Äôs harmless*¬†I told myself.

I grabbed my food and sat on the couch, eating and watching tv while simultaneously scrolling through social media.¬†

After an hour and a half or so, I decided it was time for bed. I placed my dishes in the sink, scooped Mitsy off of her cat tree where she liked to lounge, and headed to my room. I locked the door, just as a precaution.

When I woke up, I checked the coffee table. Nothing. I checked all around the house. No package in sight. I sighed with relief and continued on with my day.

It was three days before the next one appeared.¬†

When this one showed up, it was a tad bit larger than the last one. Still wrapped in the same white paper, though this one had a royal blue ribbon wrapped around it. There was no note.

Opening it, it was a necklace chain, seemingly for the pendant I had received a few days earlier.

The gifts continued like this, every three days. However, it was always something different in the boxes.

Gift 3: a heart shaped trinket box; yellow ribbon.¬†

Gift 4: a piece of polished obsidian; fittingly, a black ribbon.

Gift 5: a vintage-looking handheld mirror; pink ribbon.¬†

I gladly accepted these gifts, always saying a quiet ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to whoever had left them.

It was after the fifth gift that things started to take a turn.

Three days after the mirror, I went to the coffee table to find another package, this time wrapped in black paper with a white ribbon wrapped around it.

Not thinking anything of it, I opened the package - It was a tooth. A singular human tooth with root still connected.¬†

I gasped and dropped the package. I left it on the floor when I went out to work.

When I came home, it was back on the coffee table.¬†

The packages kept coming after that. I tried to ignore them, but when I did, a note with the same handwriting as before would appear, reading ‚Äúopen me‚Äù in red ink.

Gift 7: the head of a bird; black paper, white ribbon.

Gift 8: the eye of a small mammal; black paper, white ribbon.

Gift 9: a¬†*human*¬†finger; red paper, white ribbon.

I called the police after this one, and they took it as evidence. They said they would be in touch with me, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything since. I gave them the rest of the ‚Äúgifts‚Äù just in case they could track whoever was sending them.¬†

When I found the tenth package, I was horrified.

A large kitchen knife, covered in blood; red paper, black ribbon. A note next to it read ‚Äúno police, no telling‚Äù in red ink with the same, beautiful cursive.

I sobbed, screaming ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this? Who are you?¬†***What***¬†are you?‚Äù I got no answer.

I‚Äôve been considering moving but I‚Äôm worried it will follow me. Maybe it would move onto the next person who lived here, but I‚Äôm too scared to find out.

I haven‚Äôt eaten since the knife. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt breathe. I can‚Äôt think.

It‚Äôs been two days after the last gift, and I‚Äôm terrified to see what awaits on my coffee table tomorrow.",3,1743448804.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Woke up on day 4 tired, but with NO headache! Just transient head pressure occasionally throughout the day. Besides fatigue still had a little difficulty concentrating, but because the pain was gone I was in such a good mood.

Today, day 6. I feel *very* good. Honestly, I'm shocked. I'm 51 and have been drinking heavy caffeine, mostly in for the form of coffee, for 35 years....minimum of 400 mg a day and often probably reaching 600-800mg! I expected it to take much longer to feel good so I could not be happier. 

I will *never* go back to daily caffeine. Not saying I'll never have it again the rest of my life, but I will never go back to daily, or even routine, use.

recently, i started on propranolol and it's been helping a lot with frequency. the other day, i had used too much styling product in my hair and fallen asleep, and as i have a sensitive scalp, any slight change in weight of my hair (oiliness, too much product, even washing it, or getting a haircut) can be a migraine trigger. 

so that day, i woke up with a pretty bad migraine and intense nausea, with no desire to eat anything, but i had an event to go to that evening that i was determined to go to, so i started fighting it right away. i had some liquid iv, 2 ritz crackers, an advil, an excedrin, and my propranolol. i know that was probably too much but after that i went to wash and dry my hair. at that point i was already feeling a bit better so i ate some rice krispies and oat milk so that the advil could work better. by that point my partner was also awake and had made me some coffee so i had that as well. 

by then it was about 3 hours after i had woken up, and i felt well enough to go to the event that evening. i did some chores and went to the event and everything went fine. but when we got home, my stomach was really upset, i felt super nauseous, my scalp was achey and sensitive, and my skin felt like i was being scraped with sandpaper, even lying in bed with my cool sheets. it was really weird; just generally felt super post-drome-y, way more than usual, but with no distinct migraine pain. 

this made me wonder if maybe i hadnt actually stopped having the migraine, if the medication cocktail had just suppressed the pain receptors but all the other symptoms and bodily experiences continued. now, i've been struggling to sleep for the past 2 days and have been waking up feeling really tense with a lot of shoulder pain, so i'm wondering if maybe taking all my meds like that was okay for getting through that day but not actually helpful for my body/the other internal migraine symptoms. 

has anyone else had a similar experience? any advice regarding the medicine cocktail? i've kind of been a little reckless with them so any advice, any big no-nos, or shared experiences would be very helpful! thank you!",2,1743448390.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

1jobd2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodOmensAfterDark/comments/1jobd2r/yet_another_reason_this_series_is_awesome/,Yet another reason this series is awesome,"Howzit, everyone. Hope you're all doing good today. So, because it's the trans day of remembrance, I wanna get a little sentimental over here for a hot minute on the Good Omens porn subreddit if that's okay.

I am transgender. I am largely male save for the odd occassion where my mind goes ‚ÄúEh, fuck it, you're genderless today.‚Äù I just wanted to say that this show has meant so much to me and my queer arse. The amount of fucks these characters don't give when it comes to gender and sexuality makes me so happy. Crowley puts on a dress? Beelzebub uses they/them? No one cares! And Aziraphale and Crowley and Gabriel and Beelzebub being interested in one another has nothing to do with their gender and everything to do with demon/angel being no-no. Hell, these characters don't even really have genders and that's just normal to them.

My partner grew up with a ton of religious trauma about his queerness at the courtesy of his parents and a show like this has meant the world to him. The not cishet angels living in a society where this is the norm would have made his mother so angry.

In conclusion, this series has been a help to me and others in my life in a way that really surprised me. I was expecting a silly fantasy show but what I also got was validation. And a heartbreaking season two. Anywho, I hope this show has helped others in the same way as its helped me. I'm gonna go get some coffee now.

1jobd0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesGamersNews/comments/1jobd0r/little_sim_world_coming_to_early_access/,Little Sim World Coming to Early Access,"Four years ago we found a game in the works for Steam that looked so sweet that¬†[we wrote about it](https://ladiesgamers.com/little-sim-world-steam-to-switch/), hoping that it would eventually come to the Switch as well. Kind of ambitious of us really, as¬†*Little Sim World*, as it's called, still needed a lot of work still to get in the Early Access stage on Steam.¬†

But now it's time:[¬†*Little Sim World*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1429880/Little_Sim_World/), developed by BGS Studios is coming to Early Access on May 1st. Set in the heart of London,¬†*Little Sim World*¬†is a cozy 2D Life Simulator that reshapes how players engage with their surroundings.

You will move into your snug little home and start exploring a bustling, open city‚Äîno loading screens, just seamless adventure! Stroll through lively streets filled with NPCs, busy shops, and delightful hangouts like Simon‚Äôs Pub, Moon Coffee, or the Let‚Äôs Go Grocery Store. Want to cast a line at the canal, hit the gym, or curl up in the library? The city is full of spots designed to match your mood.

Your tiny character is yours to shape from head to toe‚Äîpick their style, personality, and traits that evolve as your sim grows. Decorate and upgrade your home, experiment with layouts, or upcycle furniture to sell at the pawn shop. And don‚Äôt forget to care for your little human‚Äôs needs. Everything from hunger to comfort and happiness matters, as well as the dynamic weather.¬†Sounds and looks good!¬†

1jobd0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1jobd0j/cooper_in_part_18_spoiler/,Cooper in Part 18 [Spoiler],"Just something that clicked with me while rewatching.

Our Coop is pure good, as seen when he is Dougie and just by existing (and following the Lodge/intuition) he makes everyone's life better.

Mr. C is pure evil.

When Coop (or Richard?) wakes up in the Motel, he is no longer our spunky happy coffee-loving Coop, nor is he the violent and pure evil Mr. C. His actions in the diner show a more balanced and 'real' person, just how many suspect that this final place he ends up is the 'real world'. A Ying and a Yang in one body.

Needs that I see:

1) Reasonable Weight for this 'mobile' scenario  
2) As 'idiot proof' as possible  
3) High Reliability  
4) Easy Cleaning  
5) Fast  
6) 110V power sources (typical at trade shows)  
7) Possible 2 person operation to make 2 cups at a time  
8) Easy access to repairs if it should break.

I ran an AI search and it came back with two top contenders : Nuova Simonelli Appia Life Compact with Autosteam and Jura Giga 10 Professional.

It's about the various mass extinctions that have taken place throughout the earth's history. I also really enjoyed Plagues Upon the Earth, about the impact of infectious disease on human history. Both books were sort of pop science -- enjoyable and engaging for a non-scientist to read, but still smart and accurate. 

Any other suggestions in that general vein? I'd love to read about human or animal evolution, maybe plagues or natural disasters, the earth's history, etc. The intersection of natural history and anthropology is especially fascinating to me. I have read Sapiens already and didn't love it. 

I'd also be really interested in coffee table books with gorgeous illustrations to go along with content -- I was eyeballing ""Earth: Over 4 Billion Years in the Making"" which is a tie in to the BBC Earth series.

1job84j,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1job84j/4_years_of_pure_chaos/,4 years of pure chaos,"Hello, 

I'm writing this because I'm lost. If anyone is open to DM'ing
I'm lost at where to go with this. 

4 years ago- I met this lovely lady 
She was married which was cool we were just friends and talk here and there. 

One day we were catching up and drinking a little bit and she blurted out she's always liked and wanted to fuck me
That her marriage was going down hill and planning to leave him

I had crush on her but explained - I wanna see you get divorced 

She said she moved out and ect even went as far as sending fake documents 

I believe her and we started seeing each other within a month
She said she had to speak with him and had a sleepover 

Come to find out she never left. 

She became emotionally abusive, she would beat me down but then tell me how much she loved and to hold out. 

Long story short, this went off and on for the past 4 years.

Untill this week. 
I move out of the state.
I had to go back to for work and I saw her.
We caught up but And she began the perpetual cycle of asking what we are. 
I told her that she's married and we can't continue this on and it was just supposed to be us talking and catching on. 

Everything escalated because she wanted to come out and see me where I live now. 
And that was with friends at the time and I couldn't pick up her phone call. 

Long story short, fast forward to 2 weeks later mid-march 
She came out here and called me and said that she's in the area and wants to get coffee. 
I called her back and said I was happy to meet for coffee. I'll be there in 15 
Within 5 minutes she blocked me and then claimed that her husband had come out here and And that she was so sorry and had to bail. 

I just didn't respond or say anything. 
She continued a few days later and apologized that that wasn't her and that she would never bail on me and she felt horrible 
And that if I wanted to end things and walk away from us that she understood. 

I didn't respond because I didn't know what else to say or do at this point. 

The next day she sent me pictures of her across the street from my home. 
And how they were in the area exploring and eating of the places that I had mentioned I wanted to take. 

I blocked her. I didn't know what else to do. 
She had actually because of this tried to contact me and unblocked me on Facebook. 

I saw her Facebook after not seeing it for the past 2 years 
And it's really messed up because. 
She's literally shaping her husband into the same style that I wear down to the beard and choice of chains.

And then as I scrolled through the page she did all the date ideas that we had mentioned that we were going to do together once they were done. 

At this point - she sent me a huge text message telling me how terrible of a person I am and how I just use her and ghost her at the moment's notice and that I'm just a person that is meant to be alone for the rest of my life because I can't accept real love 

While she was living a full-on double life being married and trying to hold a side relationship with me 

I was kind about it and I had sent a pretty heartfelt message about how much I cared about her and loved her, but that this was my fault that I shouldn't have continued this and I ended it off with a screenshot from the lost and translation with a good quote ""in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go""
And I just said I care about you and I love you and this is goodbye and I'll miss you. 

This escalated the situation instead of a positive response

She me a A picture of a trash can and said I went downstairs to do some recycling and saw this and it reminded me of you. I thought I could recycle trash. I guess not.

Tbh - after putting so much emotion into my last message and I felt like I was civil, patient, kind and loving 

This just made me fly off of the handle. I went kind of off. I called her out on her infidelity 
And how she was totally okay with sleeping with me and rolling into bed with him the next moment 
How she never stayed over at my house but yet would love to go into bed with him every night and act like everything's fine. 

Then she went off to say that I'm insecure and I'm a terrible human being and that I'll never understand how much she actually loved me.

And that she was glad to see the true colors of me and that she wasted so much time investing into me. 
And that she's happy that she never left that dude for me because it would have been a terrible decision for how disgusting of a human being I am


I said - Look 
You never left 
You just kept crawling into bed with him and then went ahead and kept me on a string 

You sent me photos of you guys together at Thai event, when you knew it was my going away party 

You told me how much you loved me but then went home to him 

Please excuse me if I'm a exactly not the same anymore 

And the thing is it's not even your fault 

It's mine because I kept coming back because I kept hoping that maybe if I showed you enough Love 

And I showed you how much I really care 
And how much of an impact you make on my reality 

That just you would come back that just maybe you would give me an actual chance 

But in the end of the day you didn't 

At the end of the day you came to my town and then you rubbed in my face how you were right across the street with your husband. How is that love?

She didn't open my message and left it there. 

Right now, I'm at a loss. 
I'm so tired, so heart broken. So over this.
I gave so much love only for it to be dismantled and burned down. 

If anyone is willing to talk about this. I can't go to my best friends anymore about it. They hate her and don't wanna hear it.

1job67e,https://i.redd.it/8p6uvs8hp2se1.png,Survival tips - 10 days,"How to Stock Up for 10 Days for 3 People (No Overkill, Just Practical Stuff)
 Okay, let's say you want supplies for three people to last 10 days, but you aren't trying to build a doomsday bunker. What should you get to avoid surviving on dry crackers and tap water?
 1.  Water ‚Äì The Essential
 Minimum: 3 liters per person per day ‚Üí total 90 liters.
 Large 5L or 1.5L bottles are easier to store than dozens of small ones.
 If you have a water filter (like Brita), that‚Äôs great, but still keep bottled water just in case.
 2.  Food That Won‚Äôt Go Bad (And That You‚Äôll Actually Eat)
 Canned meat and fish ‚Äì classics, but get something you actually like (e.g., tuna, p√¢t√©, stews).
 Pasta, rice, grains ‚Äì easy to store, quick to cook.
 Jarred sauces ‚Äì like tomato sauce or curry ‚Äì because plain pasta is sad.
 Oatmeal, granola, energy bars ‚Äì quick energy, no cooking needed.
 Nuts, peanut butter ‚Äì high-calorie, long shelf life.
 Dried fruits and veggies ‚Äì for vitamins, so you don‚Äôt feel like a soldier eating rations.
 Canned ready meals ‚Äì like baked beans, chili, stew ‚Äì just heat and eat.
 Chocolate, coffee, and tea‚Äîbecause mental health is also important. 3.  How to Heat Your Food?
 Camping stove + gas canisters ‚Äì solid choice, but gas runs out.
 Chemical food heaters (MRE heaters) ‚Äì used in military rations, heat food without fire or electricity.  Just add water, and it does the rest.
 Tealight candles + a metal mug ‚Äì works, but takes ages.
 Thermos for hot water ‚Äì once you heat it, a good thermos keeps it hot for hours.
 4.  How to Stay Warm?
 If you rely on electric heating and power goes out, consider:
 Emergency foil blankets (Mylar blankets) ‚Äì reflect heat, wrap yourself or use as window covers.
 Winter sleeping bags ‚Äì better than regular blankets.
 Layered clothing ‚Äì several thin layers work better than one thick sweater.
 Candles and tealight heaters (like a clay pot over candles) ‚Äì can slightly raise room temperature.
 Chemical hand warmers (for hands and feet) ‚Äì last several hours, great in a pinch.
 If your house gets cold, it's better to heat one room at a time. 5.  Lighting ‚Äì Because Darkness Sucks
 Headlamps ‚Äì hands-free = more convenient than flashlights.
 Battery-powered LED lights ‚Äì much brighter than candles.
 Candles and tealights ‚Äì long-lasting, but not super bright.
 Power banks with built-in flashlights ‚Äì two functions in one.
 Dynamo or solar-powered lamps ‚Äì no need for batteries, always ready.
 6.  Other Useful Stuff
 Toilet paper, wet wipes, soap ‚Äì dirty hands + no water = disaster.
 Basic medicine and first-aid kit ‚Äì painkillers, cold meds, band-aids.
 Trash bags ‚Äì multipurpose, can even be used as emergency covers.
 Multitool / knife / can opener ‚Äì seriously, don‚Äôt forget a can opener.
 If you have pets ‚Äì stock up on food for them too!

**As promised, a raw account of** [Infidelity Baseball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ5Bq20Jvuk&t=32s) **part 2**

She showed up on time at 12pm. She was presentable, but not trying to look overly sexy or anything. I guess, after everything she's done, the goal is to try to look respectful.

I maintained a respectful coldness in my tone, the way you'd interact with a colleague you didn't know very well but had to work with. That's the tone I set for the entire meeting.

I greeted her at the door, invited her in and offered her coffee. She then waited for me in the sitting room like a guest while I made the coffee. I could tell she was nervous. I was a little nervous myself, but quietly confident. I knew I was well prepared.

I started by reiterating the terms and the scope of the conversation.  I didn't use the term infidelity baseball, but I explained that after seven years of lies and betrayal I didn't feel I could trust anything she had to volunteer and this process was designed to make it difficult for her to lie.  I said I didn't want to hear any kind of unsolicited account from her of what happend and that I wouldn't be answering any of her questions.

She said that was fair enough under the circumstances and thanked me for giving her the opportunity, even if it was somewhat limited. She said she would like to offer an explanation, but she understood why I didn't want that from her and that she hopes the process gives me the detail I'm looking for.

I went on to explain that I have a lot more information about the affair than she probably realises. It comes from various sources. I said I know she's probably aware by now that I had a PI following them around and I've met with the APs' wife several times to share notes. But there are various other sources of information from my own investigations too.  From that, I have a scattered, but nonetheless, far-reaching, picture of the affair, and now I want to fill the gaps.

I suggested that seven years of betrayal and lies was very difficult to swallow and I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust her again, if that trust can be rebuilt, that can only happen on a foundation of full disclosure.

Just like last time, I have a series of questions for you and some I already know the answers to. If I catch you out on a lie, even once, I will end this discussion and you will never again have another opportunity to talk to me directly.

She said she understands.

**The first slew of questions I asked were to do with recent contact with the OP.**

Have you met with OP since I walked away from our relationship on the evening of March 5?

>It isn't that I met with him, but he came to me. But yes, I've seen him twice.

Did you do anything sexual with him during those visits?  Sex, a kiss, a hug, touching of any kind?

>No. We only talked and it was brief.

What dates did he come to you and where were you?

>I was here in this house both times. He showed up uninvited.  The first time was the night you left, not long after. I refused to open the door and told him to leave and to not come back.

Did you let him in the second time?

>Yes, that was the Sunday after you left.

Was he trying to continue your relationship?

Yes. I told him under no uncertain terms that wouldn't be happening. I only let him in to tell him that, but he was very upset and I had to be tactful.

Did he try to contact you again after that?

>I don't know. I blocked him everywhere and I haven't seen him since.

He didn't show up at your parents house?

>Not as far as I'm aware.  I don't know where he would get the address. He knows approximately where the house is, like the suburb, but not the address. It's not something I ever disclosed.

Are you grieving the relationship?

>I've thought about this a lot and I think if I had ended the affair before you found out about it, I might have felt something. But right now there is no room in my heart to grieve this sub-relationship while my actual marriage is in tatters. It would be like trying to feel the pain of stubbing your toe after hacking off your arm.

Do you love him?

>No, I don't think I ever did.

**The second category of questions relate to her persona while she was with him.**

Were you differnt around him?  Personality wise?

>I'm not sure what you mean by different.

An analogy would be the persona you adopt while you're around your grandma vs your school friends. You act like a different person, right?  A different persona, patterns of language etc. Did you adopt a different persona when you were with him?

>Yes, I guess I did.

Do you remember early in our relationship, there were a couple of occassions where I tried talking dirty with you?  I think I used some vulgur language, terms like pussy and cock? Do you remember what you told me?

>I said I find that kind of langauge a turn off. That it was disrespectful and that I just wanted you to make love to me.

Yes. Did you apply that logic to AP?

>No. We both regularly used vulgur terms.

Why the double standard?

There was a long pause while she considered her answer and responded:

>I think it's because I don't love him and I don't have to worry about him losing respect for me. Your respect is important to me. We are... were... equal partners in our relationship. I also feel like there's an undertone to your question that suggests what we have is somehow less than this dirty affair sex and that's just not true.  You're the only man alive who can make love to me.  When we're together, we're sharing an experience full of emotion. When I was with AP, it didn't feel shared. It felt like we were using each other's bodies for a cheap thrill.

>The dirty talk and dirty sex helped me to detach emotionally and treat him like a sex toy. Sex was always impersonal, I made sure of it.

Is that what you risked our marriage for?  For a cheap thrill?

>That isn't how I saw it. I thought we were being careful. I didn't think you'd ever find out. It's more that I underestimated the risk. In fact, I still don't know how you found out about it.

I called you that night, on the Tuesday night while he was there.  What was happening at that time? Paint the scene for me.

>When you called, I was in the bedroom and he was in the en suite shower.

Where was the box of sex toys?

>I can't remember.

Were they sitting on the bed next to you?

>Ah, yes. By then they would have been by the bed. How did you know that?

I'm asking the questions, remember?

>OK.

So this is the picture: I called you while your affair partner was in my shower and you were sitting on my bed next to a box of sex toys you were preparing to use on him. You not only fobbed me off by telling me you were having an early night, but you blamed me for your tiredness. Do you remember that?

>Yes, I told you I didn't sleep well because you weren't here with me the previous night. It sounds terrible when I say it back. I'm so sorry.

She started crying here and we took a break for five minutes.

**The third category relates to what they did together**

Whose idea was it to introduce sex toys to the routine?

>It was kind of my idea. He asked me to do a prostate massage and I told him there was no way in hell I was putting a finger in his arse. The toys were a compromise.

Did he need it to get erect?

>Not exactly, but it makes him harder, bigger. He's not well endowed, and I needed to make sure he was fully erect before we had sex.

How long have the sex toys been invovled for?

>At least 5 years.

Do you use them?  You've always told me you didn't like toys.

>I only used them as a backup if he couldn't get me off.

How often did that happen?

>I'd say about half the time. I mean, he could have finished me off, but I was unconfortable with the mess the sex toys made when they were used on him. When he finished, I always made him shower right away, so he never had the opportunity to finish me off on the occassions we used the sex toys.

Is there anything else you did for him that you've never done with me or allowed me to do?

>We tried anal once, but I didn't like it and that's why I never tried it with you.

Why did you let him finish inside you?  Weren't you worried about the risk of infection or pregnancy?

>Pregnancy was very unlikely becuase he has had a vasectomy and I was on the pill. Like virtually impossible. I'm sorry if you feel I put you at risk of STI's. I know it was selfish, but I trusted him when he told me he was only sleeping with me and his wife.

In our conversation on the 5th of March I asked if you'd had any abortions and you said no, but you didn't say anything about the vasectomy. Why not?

>I think in that moment, I was trying to protect AP's privacy as it's kind of an intimate thing to reveal. I realised soon after that it was stupid and would have told you - and I did tell you in the email - but you walked out and I haven't had the opporunity to say it in person until now. You also weren't exactly offering me opportunities to provide detailed answers in either of our last two conversations.

Did he ever say anything disrespectful about me?  Did he get off on the fact that he was fucking another man's wife?

>He did once, early in the relationship. I was really angry with him.  I even threw him out.  It made me feel so incredibly guilty about what we were doing that I couldn't even look at him. He came crawling back over the next couple of weeks and in the following month, when we next met up, we agreed that our partners were off limits in conversation. I was to never to mention his wife and he was to never to mention you.  We stuck to that for 7 years. It might be part of what made the arrangement last for so long. When he was here, it felt normal, like he was supposed to be here. We were essentially role playing that our partners didn't exist, so the focus was on each other for the short stints of time we had together.

Outside of your monthly in-person interactions, did you have virtual interactions?

>Yes.

Did you have phone sex?

>Yes.

Did you do sexual video calls?

>Yes.

Sexting?

>Yes.

How often did you do video calls and phone sex?

>About once/week. Often while I was at work. I'd message him if I was horny and go to the bathrooms and watch each other. Sound off, of course.

Did you manage to see him at all during the Covid lockdowns, while I wasn't travelling?

>No, we decided to take a break and focus on our partners during that time.

Did you even text each other?

>Yes, and there might have been some phone sex, but opportunities were scarce, so it wasn't frequent.

Did you ever meet in hotels or outside of our house?

>No. His house was always out of the question because his wife was there and spending money on hotels would have left an evidence trail. We thought it would be safer to use our house.

Did you ever meet at restaurants?

>No. We didn't even order takeway because it would leave evidence of the affair.  I always cooked for us.

Did you celebrate anniversaries?

>No. Any thoughts of the passage of time just made us feel guilty about the affair. We didn't discuss how long we had been doing it and we certainly didn't celebrate it.

Who bought the sex toys? How were they delivered without detection?

>He bought them. He has a PO box in Belfast that he used to use to buy things that couldn't be delivered to the republic. He had them delivered there.

Side note: until a couple of weeks ago, ther was no Irish Amazon store. We'd buy from the UK store mostly. But there are many vendors on Amazon UK who refuse to distribute to the republic and some products that are difficult to ship here, like anything with a lithium-ion battery in it. So a lot of people use services that can receive goods on their behalf in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK.

**In this segment I asked about other affairs**

Did you have affairs with anyone else in the time we've been together?

>No, he was the only one.

Did anyone else ever join you in the bedroom?

>No. He suggested a threesome with another man in the first year, but I said no.

Another woman?

>He never asked, but I think you know what the answer would have been.

I don't presume to know anything about you.  I thought I knew you and then learnt there was a lot I didn't know. So please answer the question.

>Well, I kind of did, he never asked.  I would have said no if he did.

Is he bisexual?

>No, the other man was so he could watch. He wanted to watch me have sex with a man who was larger than he was and to join in.

Ok, so you didn't love him and he kind of satisfied you half the time. What were  you even getting out of it?  Why keep it going for so long?

>I was getting more out of it earlier on, but over time it just became a comfortable arrangement. It seemed like it would be more risky to end it than to continue it. I know that sounds weird, but let me explain. There were several occassions where I felt guilty and thought about ending it, but OP seemed to be more invested in it than I was.  There were veiled threats about blowing up my marriage and his. He talked about leaving his wife so we could be together and I told him that would never happen. There was a high risk that if he did that, the affair would have come out of the woodwork.  She would have had questions about whether there was somebody else. I told him our relationship can only continue as it is. It's over if he leaves his wife and it's over if you find out. In a lot of ways it felt like an nuclear arms race where the threat of nuclear war is thwarted by the threat of mutual destruction. He wanted to continue fucking me and I wanted to keep my marriage. It very much felt like that could only happen if the affair continued.

>What did I get out of it?  A little bit of fun on the lonely nights while you were away and to keep my marriage. There was some excitement still in the forbidden fantasies we acted out. But at the same time, I've been quite indifferent about it for years. I've known for some time I wouldn't be upset if the affair ended.  AP, on the other hand, would have run off with me, given the chance.

**Hygiene and practical matters**

You didn't change the sheets after buggering a man with a dildo in my bed. Presumably that was because I'd be suspicious if you changed the sheets every time I went away?

>Yes. I laid down towels so the sheets wouldn't get soiled.

I know you did. There were 7 of them in the clothes hamper. You didn't even try to hide them. So much for being careful.

>OK, I'm sorry.  I actually did usually change the sheets. I washed and dried them and put them back on the bed before you got home. But on the last visit he was here the night before you got home, and I had to go to work in the morning, so there was no time to do all of that before you got home.

**Departing**

Those were all the questions I asked.  At this point, I thanked her for being forthcoming and truthful with me.  She said that she knows she has done a really terrible thing and she is so sorry. That she would do anything to fix our relationship. 

She tried to hold me and I stepped back from her and told her I didn't want her to touch me. I told her that after what she's done, her touch makes my skin crawl and that I wasn't interested.  

She then outright told me that if I took her upstairs she'd let me do anything I want to do with her.  I told her it was time for her to leave and that my solicitor was arranging the sale of the house, and would be in contact with her.  She started crying hysterically. She asked me what happens next. I said I will need a lot of time to process this, but in the meantime all contact should go through my solicitor.  At this point she was standing on the front porch, so I closed the door and locked it.

With the rest of the day, I opened a bottle of Jameson I'd been saving and went about the business of blocking our so-called mutual friends everywhere.  I re-blocked my wife's phone number.

Today (Monday) I feel like I have a much better understanding of what happened and why it went on for so long. There is nothing remotely forgiveable about it, but I can at least understand it and I can go about my life without having to wonder what happened.  I've three months now to close down this chapter of my life, starting with selling the house and posessions. Then I'm flying out to Australia.

This will be my last update for a while.  I might pop another one in after the Divorce is finalised in Australia to let you know how that process went.  Thank you to everyone who offered your support, you've been amazing.",40,1743447792.0,u_MLOpt,22,1.0,False

tl;dr: Planning a special half-day dinner date in Islamabad with my soon-to-be wife in May. Looking for fantastic restaurant recommendations and activity ideas, considering our shared love for good food, nature, and books. Money isn't a huge constraint, I want to make this unforgettable.

So, here's the deal, my parents are originally from Islamabad, but I haven't lived in Pakistan for a while. My fianc√©e and I have met a couple of times since our engagement last year, but only briefly for coffee and gift exchanges.

I'm visiting in May, and after some successful ""diplomacy"" (mostly with our mothers), we've been given the green light for a proper dinner date. This is a big deal, and I really want to make it incredibly special for her.

We both appreciate good food, love being around nature, and are both avid readers.

Now, I'm turning to you, the wise people of Islamabad:

Guys: Were would you take the ONE for a truly impressive and romantic dinner date in Islamabad? Any place you would like to visit before/after the dinner? 

Girls: If you had half a day to spend with your soon-to-be husband on a date in Islamabad, what would be your ideal itinerary? Where would you love to go, and what kind of atmosphere would you cherish?

And yes, I'll be honest:

I absolutely want to be shokha in the best way possible.
My goal is to impress the hell out of her.
I'm ready to go the extra mile to make this the best day ever for her.
She's the one, so why not pull out all the stops?

Please keep the discussion civil, but feel free to throw in some lighthearted jokes along with your genuine suggestions.

Looking forward to your amazing ideas!

Thank you so much! üôè

Ignore existing furniture, we‚Äôre looking to get some new/used furniture. We have another room (we have a separate family room for video games, tv and fireplace). I imagine this room would be for post dinner tea, board games, and lounging or reading. 

Looking for ideas on layout and decor ideas. I‚Äôm thinking traditional (e.g. wainscotting) and cozy. The shape is a bit odd with the sunken circular steps. I was thinking large L couch in left corner and a large coffee table centered to fireplace for board games but might put the coffee table a bit far from seating. Otherwise it would be off center and most inspo images are always centered to the fireplace / mantel. 

Unsure if I should put a couch alongside where the bench currently is to divide the dining room and living room or if an armchair or reading chair would be sufficient. 

If I did the wainscotting, I assume I would have to carry that over into the dining room area? Also unsure if there is ceiling trim moulding that works with our angle of ceiling. 

Would a darker accent wall (across fireplace wall) work? Or would it make the wall look short / small?

https://19grams.coffee/products/kijani-kiboko-entkoffeinierter-kolumbien-filter?variant=53983470354700

Supposed to be fruity and acidic, with a 4/5 acidity on their website, and no bitter chocolate notes, just berries and grapes.

But it's super bitter and astringent when I brew it in a V60. One of my favorites is a super fruity Ethiopia with a lemony acidity and no bitterness whatsoever. This is the complete opposite, tasting like the terribly bitter stuff I had in a hotel last week, not at all like specialty coffee.

First brew was 65 clicks on a Kingrinder K6, 15g to 250g, Hoffmann 1-cup technique.

Then I tried again with 80 clicks, 16g to 250g, and just a quick two-pour technique to extract less. Still the same.

Has anyone else tried this coffee? Could it be a resting issue? It's been roasted only 7 days ago. But I've brewed other super fresh roasts without any issues.",8,1743446328.0,pourover,32,0.83,False
1joak1t,https://i.redd.it/fqj3ue31l2se1.jpeg,Flint Dryfield & Bean Grinder,"My friend and I thought up a couple characters and their backstories for our new campaign my girlfriend's DMing. It'll be my first time being a player as I usually DM. Was doodling out my excitment while on my lunch. 

My character is Named Flint Dryfield, a fire genasi raised by his grandparents. Was a troubled urchin with lack of parental care. Struggling with maturity, his inhereted fire abilities lead him to trouble. And even more since his sorcerer powers manifested during puberty. After being taken in by his grandparents they raised him to be a better man. 

He worked in their coffee shop in waterdeep ( Dryfields coffee shop ) for a few years but continued to have impulsions and some hungout with some bad crowds until he found his new friend wandering the dumps of waterdeep. A Small statured construct built like a bullet. Wondering the dump without purpose he brought him home as he would other critters he'd find. His grandparents weren't fond of the idea but saw some potential for help at the coffee shop in the construct. 

They cleaned him up and named him Bean. He was an obviously poorly kept and old machine but was very kind spirited in it's programming. Overtime he deteriorated and became faulty. Something inside of him started to transmute with his short circuits leading to a magic combination bringing him free will and his own personality but split into a calm ,friendly demenor and a brutal one. 

Seeing that he became a liability for the shop he had to go. Flint couldn't leave his friend behind even if something's not right. So with flints progressing abilities and lack of adventure, and beans unexpected  situation they sought out together for adventure and whatever work they can find. And a hope to fix bean, or let him become his own person. 

I flavored my character to be a fire genasi sorcerer in replacment of a red dragon sorcerer. While beans a small friendly construct thats an armorer artificer that transforms into his alter ego, killer mode, named Grinder.

1joa5tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1joa5tl/sandals_royal_barbados_review/,Sandals Royal Barbados Review,"Just returned from a week at Sandals Royal Barbados and had an absolute fantastic time. This is our third time to sandals (SSC and St Lucia Grande) and Barbados didn‚Äôt disappoint. The resort was amazing and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great vacation in Barbados. ¬†

Rooms: 5/5 ‚Äì wife and I stayed in a mid-tier butler room, and it was exactly as advertised on the sandals site. I see people complain about the rooms being moldy and musty but that wasn‚Äôt the case with our room. I didn‚Äôt see any mold at all in the room and it smelled fresh upon arrival. The room was clean and well maintained, the fixtures and furniture had a few dings here and there but overall not an issue.

Food Service: 5/5 ‚Äì I remember long wait times for food and room service at SSC and St Lucia but that was not the case at Barbados.¬† We didn‚Äôt eat at every restaurant but where we did (Butches on the royal side, Chi, Bombay, Soy, Kimonos, Le Parisienne, Jerk Shack, Mariners / Pizza) The service and wait times were comparable to what you would expect in the US. All the wait staff were pleasant and delivered good or great service. I think the most we waited was 30ish minutes for our entr√©e after appetizers at Butches. At no time did we feel that we waited too long for anything.

Food Quality: 4/5 ‚Äì I think everyone who has been to a Sandals can agree that Sandals doesn‚Äôt deliver a once in a lifetime culinary experience. Like others have said before, most food is good, a few things are great, but nothing is remarkable. I would tend to agree with everyone except for Bombay. ¬†Bombay is excellent and the food is extremely flavorful and enjoyable. Besides Bombay, everything else was enjoyable and we didn‚Äôt have a bad meal. Chi was surprisingly good, Kimonos was great, and Le Parisienne was delicious. Also, the lamb chops and Steak Dianne at Butches was quite tasty.

Bar Service: 5/5 ‚Äì No large lines or long wait times. Bartenders were attentive and in pleasant moods. Really no issues getting drinks on demand. One thing I found out while there is that the bars each make their own rum punch and it is slightly different from bar to bar. One fun activity is to bar hop during the day and taste all the varieties of the rum punch.

Resort Grounds: 5/5 ‚Äì Resort is beautiful and well maintained, actively saw staff members maintaining and cleaning resort while we were there (i.e. power washing, carpentry, painting) I‚Äôve read reviews on here and other places that Sandals Barbados needs a facelift or some TLC, but besides a few spots needing new paint at the top of the buildings everything appeared to be in excellent condition.

Pools: 5/5 ‚Äì Pools were clean and well maintained, a few tiles along the coping missing here and there but overall, not an issue for me. Pools at this resort seemed to have a more sleepy, relaxing vibe and music was only played at the big infinity pool. Also, not a lot of pool games, I only saw one in the morning and one in the afternoon. ¬†Like other Sandals you must play the chair game if you want a primo spot by the pool / beach. The resort had a lot of chairs, and I regularly saw chairs by the beach and pool still available mid-morning and early afternoon, but the best seats are snagged early.

Entertainment: N/A ‚Äì We didn‚Äôt really partake in any of the nightly entertainment options and instead went back to the room to relax. Can‚Äôt really provide any info here

Beach: 2/5 ‚Äì The beach here is pretty bad for a few reasons. First it is quite small (like 500-600 feet across) and while all beaches are public in Barbados the beach is bookended by rock jetties on both sides so you can‚Äôt really continue past. If you want to take a walk on the beach that lasts longer than 2 minutes, then you might want to book another resort. Additionally, the water is very rough with 5-foot breakers at the shore. It is not possible to swim or enjoy any water activities. ¬†

Observations

I wanted to provide a few observations that my wife and I noticed while at the property. While these observations didn‚Äôt affect my time at the resort it might affect others depending on what they are looking for.

1)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As previously said, the beach isn‚Äôt great, if you want a beach vacation, go somewhere else.

2)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Also as mentioned, pools are pretty sleepy with very few organized activities and not a lot of energy at the swim-up bars. Overall, this resort is more on the quiet side. If you are looking for a party vibe you need to look somewhere else.

3)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The resort is huge and depending on where your room is it can take 10 minutes to get from one side to the other. If you have mobility issues or don‚Äôt like excessive walking, you might have a bad time.

4)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The resort is along the aircraft approach line to the airport so you will see and hear planes on final approach throughout the day. I thought it was interesting to see the different planes, but you might feel different.

5)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The two resorts (Sandals Barbados and Royal Barbados) are separated by an alley that is shared by staff and guests. While moving between resorts you will see staff doing their jobs, trash dumpsters, employee break areas, equipment storage, a/c units, etc‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt upset by it, but you might be.

6)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† No Sandals Lounge at airport. Unlike Jamacia and St Lucia there is no Sandals Lounge so you will have to wait outside on the curb for the shuttle. This might be upsetting if it‚Äôs crowded, hot, and you just had a long flight. ¬†

7)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There is a cultural difference (I think) between people in the US and Barbados. For example, in the US, when you walk into a busy coffee shop the staff will verbally acknowledge you with something like ‚Äúhello, we will be with you shortly.‚Äù In Barbados and honestly most of the Caribbean and western Europe for that matter that is not the case. The Barbados staff will acknowledge you when they are ready to serve you and when they do acknowledge you, they say something like, ‚ÄúCan I help?‚Äù to most Americans that is off putting, awkward, and rude but that (I could be wrong) is just how things are in the Caribbean. If you can‚Äôt adapt to another culture, then this resort is probably not for you.",4,1743445358.0,SandalsResorts,0,0.84,False

He responded saying that he liked how I reached out to him and would get back to me if he can hire one more team member. He never got back.

Today, I walked into the caf√© during the non-peak hour, bought a drink and presented myself and my resume. Both of the co-owners were there and he seemed very happy that I came in person because he said he was trying to convince the other co-owner to take me in and train me. Apparently, they are fully staffed and already have one trainee. I told them to give me 2 minutes to introduce myself and I did. After that, the other co-owner said she initially said no when I sent the message, but then I came in and she really liked my personality and attitude so she said she would want to hire me but she has to consider if the current schedule allows me to have a shift. 

I wanted to know what do you think my odds are and how long do caf√©s take to respond before you can consider them as a rejection? Maybe a week?

Btw I know I‚Äôm overthinking this, but just wanted to know what others have been through so I know when to stop waiting on them if that makes sense ü•π",5,1743445075.0,barista,6,0.73,False

1joa046,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1joa046/fn_a_pirate_visits_a_coffee_shop/,[FN] A Pirate Visits a coffee shop.,"‚ÄúDid I hear you correctly, sir?‚Äù The barista holds a cup, ink pen in hand, ready to scrawl the name that will be shouted when the order is prepared.
‚ÄúYes, miss. My name is Sir Remington.‚Äù He stutters over his words, caught in the sharp gaze of her quizzical eyes. She jots down his name, setting the cup on the counter behind her.
‚ÄúYour coffee will be ready soon.‚Äù Her chipper tone vanishes as she turns to the next customer, shifting into a sharp-eyed scrutiny, silently assessing whether they‚Äôll tip enough to deserve kindness. The way baristas could flip their demeanor in an instant was a mystery‚Äîone moment, confirming an unusual name, the next, debating whether to spit in a rude customer‚Äôs cup.
Sir Remington nods and steps away, scanning for a quiet corner to wait. He finds a worn leather chair nestled in the back of the caf√©, an alcove of solitude amid the bustling shop. The scent of coffee beans and lavender lingers in the air, soft lighting casting a warm glow over slouched figures hunched over paperwork and last minute school assignments.
Crossing his boots at the heels, he leans back, hoping to remain unnoticed. His eyes dart across the room, taking in the patrons around him. A lifetime of slipping past watchful gazes has trained him well. His hidden sword shifts at his side as he adjusts in his seat‚Äîyears of practice have made it second nature to slide past metal detectors undetected. No human eyes can see the medallion hanging from his neck or the worn spurs on his salt-worn boots. Beneath his leather jacket, sun-charred skin stretches smooth and steady.
Across the room, the barista leans over the counter, eyeing him. Then, in a clear voice, she calls out, ‚ÄúSir Remington!‚Äù
He rises slowly, scanning the caf√© before stepping forward. His hands land securely on the steaming caramel cappuccino, the warmth bleeding through the cup into his calloused fingers. He lifts it to his nose, inhaling the sweet, indulgent scent, allowing himself a brief moment of peace.
A voice interrupts his reverie. ‚ÄúI wish I had something that special to me in life.‚Äù
His eyes snap open, meeting the barista‚Äôs gaze‚Äîdark green and brown, sharp yet soft. For the first time, he truly sees her. Auburn hair catches the sunlight filtering through the caf√© windows, its deep red strands illuminated like fire.
His lips quirk into a twitching smile. ‚ÄúOh, my dear, I think you want more than a cappuccino to keep you happy.‚Äù he gazes at her quizzingly.
‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre right,‚Äù she muses, mirroring his expression. ‚ÄúBut it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have something like that.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen do you take your apron off for the day?‚Äù The words leave his lips before he fully registers them.
Caught off guard, she stumbles over her response. ‚ÄúUh, well, I‚Äôm off in‚Äî‚Äù
He doesn‚Äôt let her finish. ‚ÄúPardon my uh-‚Äù The abruptness of his retreat surprises even him. Turning swiftly, he strides out of the caf√©, the rush of fresh air hitting his face as he steps onto the busy sidewalk. He forces himself forward, not daring to look back‚Äîuntil he does.
From a distance, he watches the caf√© door, cup in hand. Finally, he exhales and drops into an outdoor wicker chair, his tense shoulders pressing against the chair‚Äôs back.
‚ÄúSir Remington, you do not have a way with words,‚Äù he mutters to himself, taking another sip of his coffee, savoring its richness despite the quickened pace. He tries not to think about the untouched fantasy book still tucked under his arm. With his cup on the last sip of nectar from the gods he sits there unmoving.
The bells above the caf√© door jingle. He lifts his head. With a quickness to make his neck hurt.
Stepping out into the afternoon light is the barista, auburn hair tumbling over her shoulders, a short-cropped shirt, and well-worn jeans replacing her uniform. In her hand, she twirls a green apron.
‚ÄúI got to take my apron off early today,‚Äù she says, waving it in front of him, as if jabbing a sword in his direction, waiting for a duel of arms.
Sir Remington gulps down the last of his cappuccino and bolts to his feet, stumbling over boots that have carried him across storm-wracked shores. The same boots that have kept him steady through hundred-foot waves now betray him as his knees lock at the sight of her.
The barista smirks. ‚ÄúSo, do you always run away after asking someone about their apron departure or did the coffee just get to your head?‚Äù her small smile appearing on her eyes and lips.
His smile he cant seem to hind even as hes trying to bite his lips from the inside of his mouth, his eyes cant help but be soft towards her as he speaks with a sudden ease.
‚ÄúI think more than the coffee has gotten to my head.‚Äù

1jo9y1h,https://v.redd.it/ishp0eolg2se1,Tips for my fellow multitaskers,"Hi guys! I‚Äôve learned a couple of things while making coffees and trying to cut down on the time I spend making a multiple drink order. I‚Äôm not sure if these have been discussed before, but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got so far (I‚Äôve tried these with the Basic Brew machines and the Luxe 360 machines):

- It takes 6 seconds for the coffee grinder to grind the beans enough to get to the sweet spot of ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. Any longer or shorter and you get ‚Äúokay‚Äù. One way to time this is to watch the animation of the beans; it‚Äôs one second per animation.

- Related to the above, it takes about 7-8 seconds for an espresso to hit the sweet spot. This means that if you start the coffee machine and IMMEDIATELY start the grinder, you can grind the beans just in time to stop the coffee machine. I took a video of this to demonstrate, which also shows the animations to help time the beans.*

- When making hot lattes, you have enough time between starting the coffee machine and hitting the sweet spot to fill the jug with milk and place it at the steamer. 

- This takes a bit of practice and a sense of your own timing, but it‚Äôs possible to start the coffee machine, start steaming the milk, stop the machine, move the mug, AND get the milk perfectly steamed without breaking your stride (basically starting/doing each part while waiting for the previous one to finish). This is a bit complicated, but it‚Äôs possible. If you can practice this, the main thing you‚Äôre waiting for will be for the second part of steaming. I took a video of this too to show what I mean.*

- Your other hand is your friend. Use both hands to start/stop things in time without blocking your view of the screen. 

*For the videos, I had to put them together so Reddit would post both of them in the same post. I hope it‚Äôs clear where video one ends and video 2 begins! I made them with different orders.",3,1743444837.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,2,1.0,False
