1i6dvtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1i6dvtc/what_do_i_do/,What do I do? ,"Hi, I(29M) married my (24F) wife 5 years ago. We have two beautiful (children 3 and 5) and what I thought was an “okay” life. We have always have always had our ups and downs but when we fought I was always met with you need to do better. For what seems like the vast majority of our marriage when I ask what do I need to do better it’s always “I have told you a million times I’m not going to say it again”. Mind you this has been the case for at least 3 of the years where I really do see myself improving. 

I often get told I need to do more, which is valid I feel like I can do more but it’s hard when I am also the only person who works. To me it has always felt like I do a good amount. Could I do more yes but on a typical day I wake up with the kids getting their breakfast ready and also making my wife coffee. I’ll then go to work do what I need to do there and if I am able to come home for lunch I will. I’ll make the kids and my wife lunch then had back home when I am done. When I get home I’ll try and knock the dishes out so I can start dinner during the past 5 years I have cooked dinner all but 4 times. I enjoy cooking and doing it so often doesn’t bother me but sometimes it’s feels like it goes very much unappreciated. The house is usually not very clean when I get home so if I have the energy I will try and clean up, but I’ll typically pick up 3-5 a week. Daily I usually take the kids somewhere or play with them. My wife usually tells me she has been with them all day so it’s my turn, which I think is fair. So we will play whatever game or do whatever activity they are wanting to do. She spends a lot of time on her phone and sometimes I wish she would pay more attention to the kids and I, but I feel bad she is at home all day. Whenever I bring up the phone thing she tells me I am on my phone a lot and then I usually say yeah you’re right and back down from her. That’s all I really have to say about day to day life.

One big thing we constantly fight over is how I didn’t handle how my mother came to “help” during the birth of our second child. It was a rough time, my wife’s dad had passed away and that was rough for the both of us. Him and I were close and since we were then living in Hawaii, we only knew things that family had told her. I remember her uncle calling me early that morning and giving me the news and asking if I could tell my wife. I let her sleep and when woke up I broke the news to her. She was well into her third trimester and I remember her telling me I was a liar, and then having to convince her that it was true. I have never been very good at sharing my emotions so I was able to keep it together for her. While handling my emotions in private. Then my mother comes maybe a week later. I was initially so happy to have her support because I had just had shoulder reconstructive surgery (I had lost 20% of my shoulder bone)early in November and was not able to move my arm very well. She gets there and it’s pretty clear she is treating this like a vacation. My mother is diagnosed with BPD and is unmedicated. She typically copes with red bull and does not sit still for very long.  She is offering to take my youngest child places so my wife and I can have alone time and just prepare to have our second child. My wife does not take her up on the offer and talks to me in private about how she doesn’t trust my mom and my SD. I say okay and try and be the middle man between them which I think is fair because it is my mother. So my mom thinks something is wrong and is losing her mind (something she does a lot) and I just am brutally honest and say hey look, my wife doesn’t trust you guys she had some things in her childhood that she doesn’t want to leave our kid with you. My mom then proceeds to call my grandmother and they are what my wife calls “talking shit”. My wife doesn’t know this yet and we go in to have the second baby. We leave the oldest with my mom because it’s during COVID and no kids are allowed into the delivery room. My wife is checking the google and my step dad turns it away from him (I’m not for sure exactly how he turned it) and my wife is pissed off because she thinks he is a paranoid weirdo. We then get home from the hospital, and my wife is pretty upset about the google thing and the treating this trip like a vacation all fair things to be angry about. With her dad just dying as a cherry on top. Her situation feels like it’s just no big deal and nobody is there for her.  I then see my mom crying and ask her what’s up. She is so hurt my wife doesn’t trust her and she doesn’t know why my wife doesn’t like her… she is talking to my grandmother about these things (my grandmother is a terrible person who I haven’t spoken to in 4 years). I tell my wife what’s going on and it goes about as poorly as you would expect. She’s mad that my mom isn’t seeing she just had a kid her dad just died, my mom is being selfish. My wife is yelling and screaming at me, my mom then hears that and you see where I am going. My mom’s out crying on the back patio my wife is crying in the room with the door locked. I try and talk to my wife but she has locked herself in the room, so I go and try and talk to my mom and she is asking me why my wife is treating me like this and that I didn’t do anything. I explain to her look mom “she has a lot going on and you haven’t really helped”  amongst other things. I then get to talk to my wife and she is just mad at me. My mom finally leaves and my wife is like you need to cut that “bi***”” off and maybe I should have but I didn’t. So for the past 4 years anytime there is a fight or just for no reason she will remind me that she will never forgive me for this event and she usually tell me I am just like my bi*** mother. I have apologized so many times and have told my mom that she can’t see our kids. My mom still ask and is persistent so I will ask my wife if it’s okay if my mom stays in a hotel and I can take them over and I am always met with no. I know my mom is sick and she wasn’t the best mom but she doesn’t get to see the kids very often (once a year maybe). 

This is something my wife holds over my head and is the start to many arguments. I have asked for forgiveness but am met with “why should I forgive you”. Every time I ask for grace or forgiveness I am met with “why should I forgive you, you are still fucking up”. I’m not perfect and I know that I have my issues and am going to start seeing a marriage counselor as well as a therapist to work out my childhood trauma. 

Our latest fight I was just feeling like something was off, I had saw my wife was messaging a friend (haven’t known him for that long we were both in a wedding together but we clicked) I had let this fester for a few months and she was spending some time with family in another state. I was the kids and I and I didn’t really have anyone to talk to and was alone with my thoughts for (what seemed like an eternity) that week. I thought to myself these things are bothering me, but doing all the things by myself and being the sole provider for the kids is hard. I just wanted to be better for not only myself but for my wife and kids. It was a weird feeling but I just felt like it was time to make a big change, maybe I felt that my wife was pulling away and that’s what gave me the thought… I don’t know. So I text her saying hey look, I am feeling these things I would like you to come home (early) so we can talk. This sets off a set of event I didn’t know really see coming. She begins with wow… you think I’m talking to someone else and now you want to change. I have been trying to fix this marriage for 5 years and when you feel me slipping away now you want to change. I try to explain to her that’s not why I want to change but she has convinced me maybe that is why I wanted to change. She tells me subconsciously I must have known and now I want to make things work. She ended up not coming home early because the roads were bad from a winter storm. She could have came home a day earlier but she said she wanted to have dinner with her family (brother and sister). 

She gets home (this is 1 week ago) and we talk, I very calmly tell her what I am feeling and why. She then says she doesn’t know if she can try anymore because I don’t care and she has been trying to fix this marriage for 5 years alone, I tell her I understand, I have said I will change in the past and while I have gotten better I do slip back into ruts and I haven’t 100% fixed the problems. I told her that I’m going to go to marriage counseling (originally alone but after a day or two she wanted to join) and start seeing a new therapist. She wants to do a trial separation I want to actively work on the marriage. She tells me she needs to find herself and she just needs time I’m on board with it but she refused to set boundaries for the separation. I really didn’t see the point of the separation because I felt like it is prolonging the inevitable. I love my wife and if that’s what we need to do to make it work we will. I have been having thought of unaliving and I told her that and she said I am trying to manipulate her into staying. That wasn’t my intent but maybe she is right. I reluctantly agree to the trial separation with no rules and it’s destroying me. I have been keeping communication pretty open so I know what to fix and what’s working. She told me she wants me to hurt and doesn’t care how I feel. If I want to make this work I need to just suck it up and wait until she is ready. This hurts I am not an emotional or vulnerable person and I feel like I am getting kicked while I am down. I understand her reluctance but she seems so cold to me. Today she hit me with it “ I just want time to myself so I can return to my miserable life and act like nothing is wrong”. I don’t want that why would any spouse or partner want that… it then got heated and a lot of yelling was done, I was brave enough to finally tell her that this marriage is a two way street and we both made mistakes. Then she came back with “oh what do I do wrong” I knew I wasn’t going to be able to respond to this. I know how our conversations go. I said you never give me the benefit of the doubt. “Oh yeah? Give me an example”. I’m not the type of person to really dwell on things I have always been a forgive and forget kind of guy. I don’t have specific examples to give her. It’s a constant give me an example, give me an example. I’m breaking down the conversation is over and I know it. I start telling her other people see that it’s an us thing not just a me thing . “Who says that”? I have dug myself into a hole that I don’t want to be in. I try and walk away but it’s not going to help. I finally tell her your brother and my dad are two but there are more. She is cursing and yelling fuck you fuck them, they don’t know our relationship. (Her brother lives with us.) she says I’m done with you. I’m begging and pleading for her back. My dad wasn’t around growing up I’m telling her I feel like I’m going to be a deadbeat and I’m scared I won’t be able to see the kids very often and she is says there you go again trying to manipulate me. She says I’m done we’re done. I’m heartbroken. Crying I don’t know what to do, I beg and plead with her and she finally says whatever but we’re doing the trial separation
 and it’s going to be as long as I want and need it to be. 

I’m broken I want and am willing to do whatever it takes but is it really worth it? Has anyone had something similar and made it work? ",1,1737446999.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

OLIVER: \[nervously adjusting his collar\] Okay, so... thank you all for being here. I know this is meeting number 3000 for 2025, and we're only in January, but I promise this will be worth your time.

OLIVER: \[gaining confidence\] Right! Gentlemen, I have a bold, radical plan that will require no new technology, no new bullshit handwavium, and is such a simple solution that it would probably save this company.

\[Dramatic pause\]

OLIVER: It's simple... We delete the NPCs.

\[Dead silence in the room\]

OLIVER: \[words tumbling out faster\] Those... those NPCs have been running into walls, standing on chairs, and bugging out for YEAAAAAAAAAAARS, yet there has been zero talk about just straight up removing them altogether!

EXECUTIVE 2: \[pinching bridge of nose\] Son...

OLIVER: \[interrupting, increasingly passionate\] The only thing they do is STEAL YOUR FRAMES and do NOTHING to benefit players! Bartenders don't give missions, security runs into walls, and they generally just inconvenience everyone!

EXECUTIVE 3: \[leaning forward\] Are you suggesting we remove all NPCs from Wild Star?

OLIVER: Yes! Exactly! Think about it - instant performance boost!

\[Murmuring among executives\]

CEO: \[speaking for the first time\] Oliver, was it? Let me explain something. Those NPCs you want to delete? We've spent approximately 134 million dollars on their AI development.

OLIVER: \[enthusiasm deflating\] But... they don't work...

EXECUTIVE 1: We've also sold multiple ships specifically designed for NPC crew gameplay.

OLIVER: \[frustrated\] That isn't what I'm talking about. That feature isn't even in the game yet. We're selling promises of NPCs that work while actual NPCs are breakdancing on tables!

EXECUTIVE 2: And promised a living, breathing universe...

OLIVER: \[perking up\] Surely we could just temporarily turn off the NPCs at stations? Just to improve server performance in the interim? \[gesturing enthusiastically\] Think about it - we could market it as a special event! ""The Great Migration"" or something. Say all the NPCs went on strike!

\[Executive 3 chokes on his coffee\]

CEO: \[rubbing temples\] So your solution to our NPC problems... is to tell our backers that our virtual characters have formed a labor union?

OLIVER: \[brightening\] Well, when you put it that way, it's kind of innovative, right? We could even sell digital protest signs as cosmetics!

EXECUTIVE 1: \[whispering to Executive 2\] Is he serious?

OLIVER: \[getting more excited\] No, no, hear me out! We make it lore! The NPCs are demanding better pathfinding algorithms! \[counting on fingers\] We could sell protest emotes, ""Support the Strike"" t-shirts, digital coffee mugs with clever slogans...

EXECUTIVE 3: \[recovering from choking\] You want us to monetize our own NPCs rebelling against... us?

OLIVER: \[completely earnest\] Think about it - when's the last time you saw an NPC actually tend bar? They're basically on strike already! We're just making it official!

\[Marketing Director suddenly sits up straight\]

MARKETING DIRECTOR: Wait... he might be onto something. ""Join the Revolution"" starter packs... ""Solidarity"" ship skins...

CEO: \[horrified\] Absolutely not! The last thing we need is players asking why our NPCs need better working conditions!

EXECUTIVE 2: Plus, what happens when we finally fix the AI?

OLIVER: \[shrugging\] Call it a successful labor negotiation? The NPCs won better collision detection and basic motor functions!

CEO: \[standing, looking deeply tired\] Thank you for your... creative thinking, Oliver. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable in our coffee procurement department?

OLIVER: \[dejected\] You mean... the break room?

CEO: Exactly. Meeting adjourned. Everyone, see you at meeting 3001 in an hour to discuss adding another shader to clouds.

MARKETING DIRECTOR: \[as Oliver leaves\] But what if we called it ""The Great Server Liberation""...

CEO: OUT!

Hi everyone,

I’m a 28-year-old male living in Abu Dhabi, and I’ve been here for six months. While the city is great, making genuine friends here has been really challenging. So, I’ve decided to take the initiative and create a WhatsApp group for people aged 25-35 (mixed gender) who are also looking to connect and make new friends.

The goal is to build a group where we can:
	•	Organize regular meetups around Abu Dhabi.
	•	Plan outings like exploring the city, coffee meetups, movie nights, or even brunches.

2nd professor, a man who is a biology professor (Dr.). He has also done a LOT for me and given me huge opportunities. I have no idea what to give a man to be honest. All the men in my life are gamers so it's always an easy gift. And the ones who aren't are always happy to receive like a new pair of boots yk? Maybe a coffee cup?

My Parents Are Acting Like Nothing’s Wrong—But I Know He Died Five Years Ago.,"Ethan died overseas. That’s what the army told us. That’s what the funeral was for. That’s what I’ve been grieving for the past five years.

But last night, I came home, and he was sitting at the dinner table.

Same short-cropped hair. Same easygoing grin. Like no time had passed at all.

Mom ladled soup into his bowl. Dad laughed at some joke I didn’t hear. They looked… happy. Normal.

Like they didn’t remember burying him.

My hands shook as I dropped my bag. “Who is that?”

Mom beamed. “Honey, look who’s home!”

Ethan turned to me, eyes bright. “Hey, kid. Long time no see.”

I didn’t sleep that night.

I locked my door and listened. He was still awake. Pacing the hallway. Stopping outside my room.

This morning, I found my parents in the kitchen. “That’s not Ethan,” I whispered.

Mom’s smile vanished. “Don’t say that.”

Dad kept stirring his coffee, hand trembling.

“He died,” I hissed. “We buried him.”

Mom’s jaw tightened. “Your brother came home. That’s all that matters.”

Ethan walked in, rubbing his eyes. “Didn’t sleep either, huh?”

I felt sick.

That night, while he slept, I searched his room.

Everything was exactly as he left it before deployment. Same boots by the bed. Same dog tags hanging from the mirror.

Same framed photo on the nightstand—the one of us fishing as kids.

But when I picked it up, my stomach dropped.

The picture had changed.

I was there, sitting on the dock.

But Ethan wasn’t in it anymore.

A floorboard creaked behind me.

I turned.

Ethan stood in the doorway, watching me.

Not smiling anymore.

“You shouldn’t be in here,” he said softly.

My hands were shaking.

“Who are you?” I whispered.

He tilted his head. “I’m your brother.”

“No, you’re not.”

The grin returned, but his eyes stayed cold.

“Then why do Mom and Dad believe me?”

I couldn’t answer.

I'm also thinking about water fasting maybe drink some coffee just to cheat a little bit have some toast with some avocados and do some more Pull-Ups. 

My routine is going to be easy I'm awake about 5:00 like I usually do when do 10 minutes of drunk rope and 10 sets of pull-Ups, as I progressively try to do more during each sets I'm still going to try to accomplish my hundred pullups a day. I don't want to have weak back and weak shoulders that's the thing I think I'm lacking in if I'm going to become stronger, I don't want to seem like some sort of lackluster just because I got some jump roping in so most definitely had to do 100% on this. I need to say sober and say clean and most likely this is going to wake me up and I'm going to stay up until 7:00, the rest of my time I'm probably just going to do homework. Work on my body paragraphs and get my basics out away. I just started doing University and because I could do it on the past time I don't have to worry about it interfering with my life and I still don't pay any bills so I don't have to worry about anything. 

When I was younger I used to do 100 pushups a day and I was progressively getting better at it until started falling in love with dibs but the thing is I wanted to do a thousand reps because I thought 100 was still something I could accomplish easily within an hour and within a day I could probably do a thousand but I think I messed up my shoulder and it had to do with my back pain so weak and I really pulling my shoulders back in the way they should be. Another thing about the way I hate it how I do push-ups is I was using a lot of momentum just to push me whenever I should have do a lot of time under tension.

May sh...he rest in peace(Ha Ha Ha! Get it? Peace?)","

A frail-looking young man with pale skin and dark circles under his eyes was sitting across the table. He was cradling a cup of coffee in his hands .

""After all the things i went through, now this "". The people in the dining table winced. ""We apologize, the orphanage director never said anything about rain having a sister that year"", the woman said. The said frail-looking young man with pale skin looked at her with eyes that looks like what a cat would make if you were to throw a bucket of water over it, and said ""I am a boy"" calmly, very very concerningly calmly.

""pfft"" Rain, his sister whom he just met after all these years spat out her tea.

Her mother looked as if she would rather be swallowed up by the ground, over having this conversation. Her father just looked uncomfortable.

He cleared his throat. ""Can you tell us why you are here? We can adopt you now. Please just say so. We are happy to see you, to know Rain wasn't always alone in her entire life.""

The said frail-looking young man with pale skin AKA soon to be ""late Mr. Sunless"" was it? looked at him. He replied ""Well, i heard that fulfilling a dead persons wish would bring good luck, right? Well, congratulations, you just found an entirely unheard breed of a dead person, aka a dead man walking. Welp, you didn't even need to go that far, one came to your doorstep, in the flesh. You must have been blessed by the god/ goddess of luck or something! ""

Now they look at his complexion seriously, while trying not to laugh of course. They all had one thought in mind ""How does she simultaenously make us feel a primal instinct to protect her... i mean him while managing to make it hard not to laugh and send her... \*cough\* \*cough\* i meant ""him"" obviously \*cough\* to the deeper end of his? her? (damn it make up your mind already you bastard of a brain. you are supposed to be on my side here. don't you dare set a cancel culture cult on me, this time) an existential crisis"".

""We can talk about. please don't do anything rash. even if everything seems hopeless, suicide isn't the way......""

""Oh for the love of..., I am infected by the nightmare spell, ah, same difference I guess.""

Now their eyes widen in horror.

How long more they ask.

You turn to your sister ""Our birthday is on day after tomorrow right?""

Ok now they can be excused for not immediately assuming that their 14 year old daughter... adopted daughter Rain and that gi... boy there are twins. I mean can you blame them?

He continued, like as if his revelation didn't just shake them to their core ""I'll try lasting till then"".

Rain grimaces and says ""uhm thanks?""

Sunny looks at her incredously and then nodded to himself ""Ahh, you don't remember me, do you?""

The man and the woman looked at each other and mouthed ""Rain was three when she was adopted wasn't she?""

They looked at him like he(I love you brain. I knew I could count on you!) was a different kind of species with insane photographic memory.

The boy... riiight, Sunless says ""Is there an extra room in this house or something? I'll be staying here for a while.""

Ok now they are sure they are looking at a cat in human disguise.

The man said ""We have a room for you. You can wear the clothes you find there. Why don't you wash yourself up first. We'll discuss about your condition. We can teach you a few things, that would make sure you survive there""

He looks at them as if he was looking at a small child, just sighs tiredly, and spoke to them, just as patronizingly as he looked at them, as a small child and as if it's his responsibility to teach them the harsh realities of life, etc, and with his infinite wisdom and patience, decides to save them from the second hand embarrassment and says ""Don't bother. I am malnourished, underweight, weak. What could you"" he looks at them, in a way, you know, one would look at a child saying some fantasy story, and you play along, and decided to do exactly that ""Fine, your holiness, please enlighten this humble begger and impart him with the knowledge and wisdom to survive.""

Why? Why? Why? They all thought on loop. How does he make us feel like children rather than the other way around, without even trying? Is this the infamous ""Young Geezer Syndrome?"".

The man says ""Children, go to the rooms. And Sunless, we'll call you in a bit. The maid has prepared a bath for you. Your new clothes will be left on the bed. Wear them. You can come back here after that. We'll continue this later.""

He just shrugged and went to the room.

""Seriously? Does he think it's his home or something"" the man thinks.

""Cute! He is just like a cat!"" the woman(rain's mom) thinks.

Inside Sunless's room, sorry, someone's room, he looks at the clothes arranged on the bed. He locks the latch on the room. Finally some privacy!

He enters the bathroom. He then looks at the mirror, and just tsked at his reflection, in annoyance at the dirt on his priceless body. He looks at the bathtub. He smiles. Good. I need to maintain my looks. If I look too clean, I will be labelled as a fraud, again. If I look too dirty and pathetic, I will be chased away. Just the right amount of shivering, looking weak, etc, you can get away with many things.

But, since I am gonna die anyway, might as well indulge my self.

He removes his clothes and steps into the tub. ""Ah. this is life"" He says. He opens the new bath scrub, and uses it on himself. He drops generous amount of shampoo in the tub, and rinses his shoulder length hair. He decides to pamper himself. It's not his money after all. He removes the dirt and grime and cleans his hair, again. He gets up, removes the drainer. After it became empty, he turned on the valves, started warm water, once more. A man must set his priorities straight.

After nearly half an hour, he was done. He looked at himself in the mirror. ""Woah, is this what skincare products do to your body?"" he asks himself. ""No wonder why everyone in the slums like me. Hell, i'd fall in love with myself if I could!"" He checks the mirror closely to check if he missed a spot. Who am I kidding? This narcissist is just admiring his body!

He goes out the bathroom. He saw a pair of underwear, in a brand new pack. 'Alright, they are good. I'll give them 7 stars out of 10' He mused. He puts it on. he then puts on the black shirt that accentuates his pale skin. 'Ahh, that woman has some fashion sense'

He looks at the wardrobe mirror, and puts on the practiced ""kicked puppy"" face that was famous among the old women in the slums. He droops his shoulder accordingly. His body mass or the lack thereof does the rest of its job properly. You spend a minute or two messing your hair. You take a deep breath, after preparing your face and body to become a perfect embodiment of ""pitiful and must be protected at all costs!""

He then walks out with slumped shoulders. He must look the part after all, ahh who was he kidding? was there even a need to try hard now?",1,1737444804.0,u_Ill-Homework3399,0,0.99,False
1i6ddab,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i6ddab/instructions_for_dating_olivia/,Instructions for dating Olivia,"**The List**

The envelope showed up under my door two weeks after Olivia moved in. No stamp, no return address—just my name in tight, scrawled handwriting. I might’ve ignored it if I hadn’t caught her ex’s name on the flap: Mark.

Inside was a single sheet of paper titled: “Tips for Dating Olivia.”

The list started harmless enough, almost helpful:

• Her favorite cake is carrot (no raisins).

• She hates lavender-scented candles.

• Her birthday is March 14th. Lilies are her favorite.

It wasn’t until I reached the bottom of the page that something felt off: 

• If she says, “The trees are blossoming,” reply, “Life is beautiful.” You must get this right.

I laughed, even as a chill rippled down my spine. A joke, I thought, his pathetic way of messing with me. Olivia had warned me about Mark—manipulative, obsessive, unable to let go.

I crumpled the note and tossed it in the trash.

**It Starts**

The first time it happened, we were walking through the park. The cherry blossoms were blooming, pink petals floating in the breeze. Olivia stopped, staring up at the trees.

“The trees are blossoming,” she said softly, her voice distant, almost reverent.

Something in my chest tightened. Without thinking, I blurted, “Life is beautiful.”

Her head tilted slightly, and for a moment, she just… stared at me. Then she smiled, warm and soft. “Yes,” she said, as though I’d passed some invisible test.

The list came back to me that night. I fished it out of the trash and smoothed the wrinkles.

**The Rules**

It wasn’t long before I started relying on the list. Every little detail lined up perfectly: her favorite foods, her quirks, even the exact way she liked her coffee. Following it felt like a cheat code to her heart.

But then the rules got stranger.

• Always knock twice before entering her apartment, even if she tells you not to.

• If she hums a tune you don’t recognize, hum along. She’ll stop after a minute, and it’s important that she does.

• Never look at her reflection in mirrors if she isn’t in the room.

I wanted to laugh it off, but the first time I forgot to knock twice, Olivia didn’t speak to me for hours. She didn’t seem angry, just… off. She stared at me like she didn’t recognize me, her movements slow and deliberate, like a predator sizing up prey.

When I hummed along to an unfamiliar melody one night, she stopped mid-tune, sighed deeply, and fell asleep. I didn’t.

**Cracks in the Facade**

The list grew longer. I didn’t know how—I hadn’t added to it. But new rules appeared in the same frantic handwriting:

• If she sleeps past 3:33 AM, wake her immediately. If she doesn’t wake, leave the room.

• She will never tell you her mother’s name. Don’t ask. Don’t try to find out.

• Burn the list, and she’ll know.

I tested that last one. Held the corner of the paper over a lighter. The flame leapt unnaturally fast, black veins racing through the page. The smoke smelled like something rotting, and Olivia knocked on the door before I could finish.

“You okay in there?” she asked. Her voice was light, but something in her tone made me freeze.

I didn’t try burning it again.

**The Whispering**

The rules stopped being enough. I started hearing whispers when Olivia wasn’t around—soft, guttural voices coming from nowhere. Once, I caught her reflection in the bathroom mirror when she wasn’t in the room. It wasn’t her face looking back. The eyes were too wide, the smile too sharp.

I covered every mirror in the house after that.

The nights were the worst. I’d wake up at 3:32 AM, sweating, heart pounding, just in time to see her stir. I’d shake her awake, and she’d mumble something before turning over. But one night, I woke up late.

3:34 AM.

She was still, her chest rising and falling with slow, shallow breaths. I reached out to shake her, but her eyes snapped open before I touched her. They weren’t her eyes. They were dark, endless voids that swallowed the room.

“You’re late,” she said.

**The Exit**

I couldn’t stay. I couldn’t leave. Every time I tried to confront her, she’d tilt her head and smile, and I’d forget what I wanted to say.

Then the final rule appeared at the bottom of the list:

• The only way out is to pass it on. Find someone else. Leave the list. Do not warn them.

I knew what it meant. I didn’t want to believe it, but deep down, I did.

A week later, I slipped an envelope under the door of someone Olivia had been texting. Just a friend, she’d said. A new guy.

Inside was a fresh copy of the list, rewritten in my own hand.

I moved out that same night. I blocked her number, deleted her pictures, but I know she’s still out there. And the whispers… they haven’t stopped.

1i6da7w,https://i.redd.it/ebnas3hytaee1.jpeg,What’s on your chopping block? Here’s what’s on mine!,"At the end of December, I started keeping track of the state of the union aka my fragrance collection in my notes app. I’ve been testing a plethora of samples and coffrets last month and this month. Recently, I realized that my collection of samples was starting to overwhelm me despite the fact that I frequently give away fragrance samples (and the occasional coffret) to my mom and her coworkers. 

My fragrance collection is massive (approximately 125 fragrances - yes, it’s deranged I know), and I know I’ll have more coming in (I shop for skincare and body care essentials at Ulta and Sephora and typically opt into the free fragrance gifts when they come about when I place my orders). So, night before last, I took a hard look at the samples that I’ve tested and decided that I needed to be more cutthroat about what I keep. After cutting my sample collection down, I no longer feel overwhelmed. 

Here’s what I decided to cut and why:
* Ellis Brooklyn Aprés: smelled like straight bourbon, with BBQ smoke and faint pine needles. I can’t speak to longevity because it was an immediate scrubber.

* Ellis Brooklyn Super Amber: smells vaguely of wet dirt (not soil, but dirt) with the chalkiness of the kid’s Flinstones chewable vitamins (there’s no fruitiness though). It also smelled faintly of amber, cigarette smoke, rubber erasers, and new tires. The new tire and cigarette smoke scent became more prominent as it tried down. I lasted about ten minutes before scrubbing it off. I tried it again a few days later and had to scrub it off even faster because it smelled even stronger than it did the first time. I cannot speak to the longevity of Super Amber either for that reason. 

* Ellis Brooklyn Salt: smells like marine air, sea salt, and prominent, dilly sandalwood. The sandalwood was not creamy either. I wore it for about 15 minutes before scrubbing it off. I also cannot speak to the longevity of Salt because it was a scrubber. I revisited it two more times and it was a scrubber each time. 

* Henry Rose Queens & Monsters: if you’ve ever played Bean Boozled, the opening smells exactly like the booger jelly bean. After about 10 minutes, the opening dries down into an incense-y smell and then a prominent, powdery sandalwood. I tried this one twice but I cannot get past the opening, especially because the opening isn’t particularly fleeting. I also don’t really like detectable sandalwood. I like when sandalwood adds a textural creaminess to fragrances but not when it has its own scent (I hope that makes sense). 

* DKNY Orchard St.: I’ve had the sample for a long time (about three years) and I actually forgot that I had it until I found it three months ago. I sprayed it on an index card that I ripped into test strips, and it reminds me of too much of DKNY Be Delicious which I have and love for sentimental reasons. I rarely use Be Delicious anymore and if I want that type of scent I’ll just use Be Delicious, I don’t need something so similar in my collection. Plus, I can pick up the leather note - and I don’t like that. As for longevity, it lasts at least three hours. I don’t know how long it lasts past that because I took a shower after I wore it for three hours last week. 

* Kate Spade Bloom: I made a post about this one. I really like the opening of Kate Spade Bloom. The crisp apple is light, sparkling, and fresh, the florals are vaguely rosy and light, feminine, and effervescent. Unfortunately, about 10 minutes into the dry down, the vetiver and the cedar wood become dominant. The first time I wore it, I didn’t much mind the woodiness and noted it as a “touch masculine”. However, the vetiver and cedar wood became increasingly prominent, masculine, and loud in subsequent wears. It lasts at least five hours. I debated on keeping it to test out on my husband but decided that I’ll just let it go to a new home since I bought him a new cologne that he loves for Christmas and a bunch of samples of fragrances that I knew he was interested in.

* Viktor & Rolf Midnight Flowerbomb: smells sweet, balsamic, and vintage makeup powdery with a kiss of vanilla. The notes blend together nicely and it performs in a linear fashion for the most part. It’s very romantic and lovely, but it’s almost identical to Miss Dior Eau De Parfum on my skin and on my little index card test strips. The only difference is some tartness about one hour into the dry down of Midnight Flowerbomb, which I assume is from the black currant. I enjoy it, but I don’t use that scent profile enough to justify keeping it when I have a sample vial (that’s almost empty but I digress) and a coffret of Miss Dior Eau De Parfum - which I enjoy far more. It lasts about six hours before fading into a warm, sweet, slightly balsamic skin scent. 

* Prada Paradoxe Intense: I didn’t record anything about this perfume the first few times I wore it because I wasn’t writing about my experiences with my fragrances that at the time. I’ve written about my recent wears though. Prada Paradoxe Intense is very warm and very sweet. It opens up with a warm burst of sugary, almost tooth-ache inducing tart sweetness that reminds me of Sweet Tarts candies. Armani My Way also reminds me of Sweet Tart candies (and not in a good way). About ten minutes into the dry down, the neroli and moss become prominent and the sugary sweetness becomes more thick and syrupy. Fifteen minutes in, the jasmine becomes prominent, as does the bourbon vanilla - which adds more warmth and sweetness. The sweetness, mossiness, neroli, jasmine, and warmth are consistent throughout the seven hour wear time of this fragrances. The notes blend together in a way that reminds me of if My Way and Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium Glitter had a baby without the coffee note of the latter. Prada Paradoxe Intense is very, well… intense. I find it to be cloying and almost insufferable in the sixth and seventh hours of wear - but perhaps I just applied too much. I cannot remember how much I sprayed (maybe three sprays? That sounds right). Either way, I don’t love that it reminds me of My Way and I plan to pick up Black Opium and Black Opium Glitter at some point. So, I don’t need Prada Paradoxe Intense. 

* Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb Ruby Orchid: I must say that I haven’t really tested this one at all. I opened it, dabbed two drops on my hand, and did a one hour sniff test. It reminds me of the original Flowerbomb minus the dustiness, with a little less sweetness, and with the addition of vague fruitiness. I really can’t pick out any of the individual notes. I suppose the vanilla contributes to the sweetness, the peach contributes to the fruitiness, and the vine and orchid contribute to the floral aspect? However, I can’t tell any of that by smelling it. I got those notes from what I could find online. It lasts at least an hour. I can’t speak on the longevity beyond that because then I showered. Flowerbomb smells lovely on my mom (none of that dustiness!!!) so I think Ruby Orchid will smell lovely on her too. I’m planning to give it to her when I see her again. 

* Le Monde Gourmand Santal Supreme: minty, refreshing, aquatic… dill pickle? On the first three wears, I tried to ignore the dilly sandalwood but on the fourth wear I had to give up the ghost and admit that Santal Supreme smelled like not only dill to me - but actual dill pickles. I love pickles, but I don’t want to smell like them. As for longevity, it lasts about six hours before fading into nothing. It’s also linear, I didn’t notice much change throughout my wearing it.

1i6d8pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApartmentDesign/comments/1i6d8pj/need_help_with_living_room/,Need help with living room,"Moved into a new place. I have to furnish basically everything, but my main concern is the living room. 12' x 14'. Enough space for a couch and love seat, or couch and couple recliners, or sectional, or sectional with chase, etc etc. Light beige carpet with light beige walls and white baseboards/window shades. So pretty much any color can go with the place.

I'm partial to espresso or walnut colors, but I'm completely open to new ideas. I think those dark colors might actually make the space feel smaller.

What should I go for? Again I'm open to ANY ideas! I'm new to the area so I don't know anyone. I'm single. But I'd like to meet people and invite them over. Or if I start dating someone obviously. So I'm not thinking  ""bachelor pad"".

Is a recliner too ""bachelor pad""? Go with a traditional sofa and love seat? Or L-shape sectional? Coffee table or ottoman? I seriously have no idea what my taste is and I'd love any ideas. I currently have a 65"" tv with stand (I need to upgrade the stand) and a cheap chair I'm sitting on just to pass the time until I get better stuff.

Budget is probably $1500. I can do more. But I don't plan on staying here more than a year or two, and I don't want to invest in super expensive furniture when I plan to buy a house in a couple years (when prices come down) and spend real money on furniture at that time.",1,1737444111.0,ApartmentDesign,0,1.0,False

1i6d58g,https://www.reddit.com/r/connectcrib/comments/1i6d58g/unlock_the_ultimate_superpower_how_to_build/,Unlock the Ultimate Superpower: How to Build Unshakable Self-Confidence and Transform Your Life 🌟,"Let’s talk about self-confidence—probably one of the most underestimated superpowers. Seriously, think about it. Self-confidence isn't about being cocky or smug. It's about owning your worth, walking into every room with your head held high, and having your actions reflect the belief that, hey, I’ve got something valuable to offer!

But how do you get there? How do you build *unshakable* self-confidence, especially when the voice in your head gets loud with doubt? Let’s crack this open together because, trust me, this isn’t just a feel-good buzzword. It’s a life changer.  

**1. Self-confidence starts with showing up.**  
Here’s the kicker: confidence doesn’t magically fall out of the sky. Step one? **Start by doing the hard stuff**. The things that scare you. Speak up in that meeting. Say yes to that opportunity you don’t feel 100% ready for. The goal isn’t perfection. It’s about proving to yourself, little by little, that you can tackle the tough moments.

Why? Because every time you show up and try, you’re cementing a new truth in your mind: ""Hey, I can do this!""

---

**2. It’s built like a muscle: through repetition.**  
Think about the gym. Do one workout and hope for six-pack abs? Nope, doesn’t work like that. Self-confidence is the same.  

- The more you make small courageous decisions,  
- Build habits that align with your growth,  
- And push through fear (even when your brain screams “abort mission!”),  

the stronger your inner confidence muscle becomes.  

And let me tell you—it doesn’t waste away so easily once it’s built. That investment? Totally worth it.

---

**3. Ditch the comparison trap.**  
Here’s something wild: Confidence is NOT a competition. Think about it—how can you fully believe in yourself when you’re constantly weighing your worth against someone else's accomplishments?  

Take a moment to think about the people you admire. Are they perfect? Nope. But what makes them magnetic is their unique energy, the way they OWN their individuality. That’s REAL confidence; it’s about *owning YOUR space* in the world, flaws and all.  

So when the comparison bug bites (hello, Instagram feeds), STOP. Pause and remind yourself: no one can be me as well as *I* can be me. And that in itself is power.

---

**4. Confidence LOVES preparation.**  
Want to give your self-esteem a serious boost? Prepare. Whether it’s mastering a skill or simply knowing you spent time and effort to do your best, preparation is the undercurrent running through calm confidence.  

Before walk-the-plank moments (interviews, first dates, whatever), sharpen your axe. Research. Practice. Daydream how it'll feel when you KILL IT. You’ll step into that moment grounded, aware that even if things go slightly sideways, *you were ready.* Trust me, that feeling is worth gold.

---

**5. Celebrate the heck out of small wins.**  
Did you try something new today? CRUSH that workout? Speak up in a group even though it terrified you? **Celebrate it.** Don’t wait for massive milestones to feel proud. EVERY step forward is something to feel good about because it tells your brain: “Hey, you’re doing it!” And good vibes stack up in your favor.

It could be as small as writing it down or treating yourself to a coffee just because. 

---

Finally—let this sink in: Self-confidence doesn’t mean you’ll never feel scared or uncertain. It means you won’t let those feelings *stop* you anymore. The magic lies in the action.    

So, Reddit fam, what’s ONE thing you can do today to boost your self-confidence? It might be as simple as trying something outside your comfort zone. Or even just telling yourself that you’re proud of showing up (because, spoiler alert: you absolutely should be).

* Do the coffee beans I use affect what I should set the grinder to?

Our conversations flowed effortlessly, and we decided to meet up for coffee after work at a cozy cafe.

The next day, we met again, this time for a movie. And then we kept meeting for two more days. It felt so natural, like we were really getting to know each other. I honestly thought he was just as into me as I was into him.

We had planned to meet again yesterday, but he texted saying, “Sorry, I can’t meet today.” 
Then, out of nowhere, he blocked me on WhatsApp and all his social media.
I even tried calling him, but he’s not answering. I’m genuinely shocked because I thought we had something.

Now, as I’m traveling back to my city, I feel so weird. The experience started out so happy and wholesome, but now it just feels bitter.

1i6d3al,https://www.reddit.com/r/connectcrib/comments/1i6d3al/the_rollercoaster_of_modern_love_chaos_ghosting/,"The Rollercoaster of Modern Love: Chaos, Ghosting, and Overthinking—Why Dating Feels Like a Never-Ending Puzzle!","Ever feel like dating is this wild mix of excitement, confusion, and just a *tiny* sprinkle of chaos? Because, same. Dating today is like trying to solve a 1,000-piece puzzle, but wait—half the puzzle's in another language and you're not entirely sure if the final picture even exists. Let’s talk about some of the big issues we all keep crashing into on this rollercoaster, shall we?

**1. Expectations vs. Reality**  
Okay, let’s face it: dating often isn’t as rom-com dreamy as we think it’s going to be. You imagine Netflix nights and heart-melting confessions, but then reality hits—and it’s mismatched texting frequencies, weird silences over coffee, or “LOL I’m just not looking for anything serious.”   
  
Sometimes, we go in with a picture-perfect idea of our ideal partner, and suddenly, *poof!* Red flags look more like cute quirks. And let’s not even get started about the “perfect date” fantasy. No one tells you that your dream dinner can totally end with you two awkwardly splitting the bill … or worse, a subpar pizza and zero conversation.  

**2. The Unending Gray Areas**  
WHY do we have *so many terms* now? Talking, situationship, exclusive-but-not-official, **huh?** You’re vibing with someone, you like them, they like you, yet somehow, you’re stuck in this tightrope dance where no one is 100% sure what “this” really is.  
  
Clarity is rare, and mixed signals are practically a second language these days. Like—is this a flirt, a friendship, or are we both just bored? Someone should put out a dictionary just to help us survive these confusing lanes.  

**3. Ghosting. Haunting. Breadcrumbing.**  
When did these *paranormal activities* become standard dating terms? For real. You’re vibing with someone, talking every day, feeling the spark…and then *poof*—they vanish without a trace. Ghosting might just hurt more than a full-blown breakup because HELLO, can I at least have some closure?!  

Don't even get me started on breadcrumbing—those teeny morsels of effort someone throws at you just to keep you orbiting around their world. It’s like, ""Sir/Ma’am, you do NOT get to DM me a smiley face every three weeks and expect me to keep entertaining this madness.""  

**4. Overthinking Everything**  
A *classic* problem. Like, did they take 4 hours to reply because they’re busy... or am I boring? Was that vague “haha, for sure” their polite way of saying “goodbye forever”? Do I post that cute selfie with this caption or nah? Suddenly, dating turns you into a full-time private investigator and part-time mind reader.  
  
It’s incredible how a single text can consume your entire brain. Did I overshare? Did I undershare? **Why does this feel like a final exam I forgot to study for?**  

**5. The Pressure (Ugh.)**  
Social media will have you thinking that everyone else is out there finding effortless love. Those cute couples with their perfect travels and sappy anniversary captions can mess with your head. And when friends or family start throwing out casual “so, are you seeing anyone yet?” questions—it’s even worse.  
  
We start feeling like dating should be a goal instead of an experience, like if you’re not partnered up by some imaginary timeline, you’re doing life wrong. Meanwhile, half of those manicured posts are hiding struggles we don’t see!  

**6. Dating Apps: Blessed, But Oh, So Cursed**  
Swipe culture. Y’all know exactly what I mean. On one hand, apps give us access to people we’d never meet organically—and okay, sometimes they really do work! On the other hand, they can leave us drained. How many “What’s your favorite movie?” or “Tell me something fun about you!” conversations can one person tolerate before they lose their will to date entirely?  

Oh, and the pressure to have the “perfect” profile picture lineup?? *EXHAUSTING.*  

---  

**But hey—here's the thing.** Dating ain’t perfect because people aren’t perfect, and honestly, that’s kind of the point. Whether you're giggling at someone’s dumb jokes on the third date or crying over a situationship that crashed and burned, this whole process is one big messy adventure.  

So be patient—with yourself and with others. (The right people will meet you where you’re at!) Trust your instincts. Share memes about the nonsense. And never forget that sometimes, the worst dates make for the BEST stories later.

Tomorrow they call the VA, and we find out if they get what they need prepped, and hopefully I can pick it up for them, and deliver this weekend. He has a follow up appt on the 4th.

I've had a CVA7845 for over 4 years, including a replacement machine 1 year in as Miele UK pulled the machine apart a few times to try and fix it and didn't make any difference. Throughout ownership, the issue always has been the time the descaling cartridge lasts. **I** **last replaced the descaling cartridge 23 August**, so just under 5 months ago. About 2 weeks ago I received a message that the descaling cartridge would require replacing soon (and the level gauge at the last bar).

I live in a hard water area, I have the **hardness setting set to 16dH**. **I** **use the machine daily, making 2 coffees on average**. The machine also auto cleans, with the cleaning cartridges lasting a very long time.

From recent reddit threads, there seem to be 2 things that give me some hope that I might get longer life of the expensive cartridges:

* A new cartridge (Material 10224080) with new formula. I picked up one of these from a Miele store yesterday but have yet to install it.
* A valve being replaced (recent update to a post suggested this improved life from 4 to 7 months).

I have an extended warranty on the machine so theoretically can get any repairs done without additional cost.

Input appreciated:

Q1: has anyone seen a marked different in life from the new cartridges ? (not sure when they were released so might be too early to comment).

Q2: has anyone else had the valve replaced (or something else) that has made a difference.

Thanks in advance.

If you merely imply it suggest some action on their behalf you get the same effect. They either completely ignore it or interpret it in the most malicious way possible even if they genuinely like you. You can still hold normal conversation otherwise, discuss values, interests, love, the weather etc. Any time you intend for your language or communication (gestures, sign language) to result in someone else taking some action you get the effect.

You ask for an iced coffee you get 90% ice 5% milk 5% coffee beans.

You ask someone to marry you she says ""yes!, in ten years"" 

You tell your doctor you'd like a prescription for something he tells the pharmacy to give you one pill and refill it daily.

You want someone to pass you the water, they throw the pitcher like a football to you. 

You say ""boy is it hot in here and wink"" hoping they turn on the AC they pull out a paper hand fan and fan you from across the room. 

You hint to your friend that another friend should bring beer to the party, the friend brings a thimble of beer.

In this scenario if you have anyone else request something for you the effect will be the same. For example If you DO get married and they request anything be done for you it'll get the same treatment as if you asked. The idea here being you can't invent some way to exist where you never have to ask for anything because someone/something else asks for you. The only way around that would be to never interact with anyone else. In which case you could order things online as long as it doesn't involve any method that could be misconstrued in any way.

So I (18m) had a good friend (20m) who I always sticked together with since I can remember. But actually we’re kind of polar opposites. I am more reserved and like to watch movies or read while he is a complete party person who goes out to drink every other day. Now this friend has an ex gf Emma (23f). They were together for about a month one year ago until my friend cheated on Emma and she dumped him for it (understandably). 

For the last few years me and this friend have started loosing contact more and more but I recently ran into Emma in the library. She is a very mature woman and is also drop dead gorgeous so I went up to her to ask her how she has been doing. From that we quickly got to talking about our favorite books and movie etc. and the day after we went to get some coffee. 

Well one thing led to another and me and Emma are together now. It is a very cozy and drama free relationship and right now we’re slowly starting to learn how to get physical with each other (we’re both virgins). Now yesterday I ran into my friend in a coffee shop and we got talking about old times and catched up on each others life. Now at one point I asked him if he has any advice for being sexually intimate with a girl, since earlier in the same conversation he bragged about how high his body count is. After I asked he asked something like „who’s the lucky girl“ and I told him the truth that it’s Emma. I thought he wouldn’t mind much, since he is someone who has a new girlfriend every other week and he and Emma weren’t together that long to begin with, plus the break up was entirely his fault. 

Obviously I thought very wrong, since after I told him he cut our conversation short, called me a „snake“ and said that he had hoped that I was actually a decent friend. I was very hurt by this and already talked to Emma about it, who (the angel she is) bought me my favorite ice cream and we cuddled while watching my favorite TV show. 

But still I am wondering if it’s really so wrong of me to date Emma to provoke that kind of reaction from my friend? I’m not going to break up with her, since I’m head over heels in love but if I am really the asshole here I’d like to know. ",3,1737442384.0,AITAH,8,0.8,False

# Personal Experience (From Sonny B’s Perspective)

Sonny B, my go-to odd-job guy, is one of those folks who seems to have a story for every situation.

When he’s not fixing fences or installing shelves, he’s battling a stubborn case of tinnitus that’s been his constant companion for years.

Naturally, I couldn’t resist handing him a [bottle of Zeneara](https://theworldhealth.org/zeneara-official) to see what he thought.

After a couple of weeks, Sonny dropped by to fix a leaky faucet, and I asked him how it was going. He said, “You know, Mary, the ringing ain’t completely gone, but it’s softer now.

I can actually sit and enjoy a bit of quiet without going nuts.” He also mentioned sleeping better thanks to the calming effects of **Passion Flower** and **Valerian Extract**, which he admitted helped more than he’d expected.

That said, Sonny’s only gripe was remembering to take it every day. “I left it by my coffee maker so I’d remember, but you know how mornings can get,” he joked.

Still, he’s sticking with it because the improvement so far has been worth it. Hearing his positive feedback just added another layer of credibility to Zeneara’s claims.

Really like major-brand teas like Bengal Spice and Good Earth. I guess maybe these are part of the ""spiced tea"" category?

Anyone have recommendations for similar teas?

I keep disliking, reporting, and blocking the ads but they keep appearing on my short video feed. Is anyone else having this issue or is it just attacking me for some reason? ",1,1737441839.0,YoutubeADS,0,1.0,False

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I can’t forget his face—skin pale, almost sickly, with a yellowish tint. Black streaks curve from the corners of his mouth, an exaggerated grin like something from a twisted children’s book. His eyes shine with something that isn’t humor.

Why me? Just a sales clerk peddling overpriced meds. Stuff people might not even need, but they buy it anyway. He’s right, though. I don’t laugh. I barely smile. Maybe I should. Maybe he sees something I can’t.

It was October 12th when everything went sideways. I was heading home, taking my usual route, but somehow ended up somewhere I shouldn’t. That’s when I saw it—a scene that felt like a circus, but way darker.

This guy in a sharp purple suit was the kind that screams trouble. Next to him, a woman decked out in this loud yellow-and-black outfit, like some twisted clown. Both of them had baseball bats resting on their shoulders. In the alley, a kid was crumpled on the ground, black and blue, and barely moving. They had him cornered, and the look in their eyes said this was just the warm-up.

I reached for my phone, but the woman turned before I could even unlock it. Her movements were too smooth, almost unnatural like a snake catching a scent. Her sharp eyes locked onto me, and she let out a scream. *“Jay-Jay!”*

The guy spun around, and his gaze pinned me in place. Those eyes weren’t just looking—they were ripping right through me, sharp and cold, like a bullet tearing through flesh. I couldn’t breathe.

*“Run…”* The boy in the alley barely got the word out, his voice too weak to carry, but I caught it on his lips.

*“Hey, look, Queenie!”* the man jeered, his grin widening as he nudged her with his bat. *“Our boy-wonder here still has some fight in him!”* 

His attention snapped back to the kid like I didn’t even exist anymore.

The woman smirked, her slender body twisting toward the boy, her movements disturbingly fluid.

I didn’t wait. I turned and bolted, my heart pounding louder than my footsteps.

I never found out what happened to that boy. But in the days that followed, something changed.

At work, I caught myself glancing over my shoulder too often. Every reflection in a window felt like it moved when I didn’t. In the quiet moments, I’d swear I heard footsteps matching mine.

Once, leaving the office late, I felt it… a presence, close enough to make my skin crawl. I spun around, but the street was empty, just shadows stretching under flickering lights.

By the time I got home, my hands shook as I locked the door. Every creak in the walls felt louder, like someone was just out of sight, waiting.

A knock came just as I was about to settle in. It wasn’t loud, but it echoed in the quiet, setting my nerves on edge.

I shuffled to the door, hesitating for a second before opening it. The street was mostly empty, except for a blonde woman walking away, her silhouette fading under the streetlights at the far end of the block.

That’s when I noticed the flowers. A bright, almost garish bouquet sitting right there on my porch. My stomach tightened as I picked them up, fingers brushing against the note tied to the stems.

*“With love, From Jay and Harleen.”*

My heart dropped, thudding hard enough to make my chest ache. It’s them. How did they know where I live? Fear crept in, cold and heavy, but underneath it—just a flicker—was something else. Something I didn’t expect.

Grim excitement.

Before the clowns, before the bloody kid in the alley, life was... nothing. A dull, endless loop.

I was the guy no one noticed. No friends, no dates, no texts blowing up my phone. Just me. Always me. School was—elementary, high school, college—the same story. I showed up, did what I had to do, and left. Nobody cared, and honestly, neither did I.

Work wasn’t any different. I buried myself in the job, pushing meds no one really needed. People came and went, and I just stayed. Invisible. I told myself it didn’t matter. Making friends? Not my thing. Social skills? Forget it.

Days melted into weeks, weeks into years. 30 years spent the same way: selling pills, scarfing down junk food, and going to bed. It was easy, predictable, and dead quiet.

Now I’ve got flowers I didn’t ask for. From people I never want to see again. And somehow, for the first time in years, I laughed. Not because it was funny—because it was ridiculous. Being stalked by clowns? What even is my life right now?

I didn’t know what else to do, so I called the cops. Told them about *“Jay-Jay and Harleen.”* They didn’t take me seriously, not really, but they did tell me to be careful.

Apparently, there’s been talk about a pair of serial killers in town. No solid evidence, though—just whispers and rumors. Great. Just what I needed to hear.

The decision was easy: I had to get out. I started scraping together every penny I could, cutting back on everything. No more takeout, no more late-night snacks, just instant noodles and black coffee. My savings grew, slowly but steadily.

But tonight, hunger got the better of me. My stomach growled like it was fighting back against the plan. I grabbed my jacket and headed to the convenience store down the street.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as I wandered the aisles, tossing a sandwich and a bag of chips into my basket. I paid, stuffed the food into my jacket, and stepped out into the cold night.

That’s when I heard it… a faint shuffle behind me.

Before I could turn, something hard smashed into the back of my skull. Pain shot through my head, bright and sharp, and then everything went black.

I woke up in some basement, tied to a chair. My head throbbed, my vision fuzzy, but I didn’t panic. I didn’t gasp or scream. I just focused on figuring out how the hell to get out of this.

Then, I heard footsteps. Down the stairs, here came the Comedian and his girlfriend, looking like they stepped out of some twisted circus.

*“Why so serious?”* He mocks me.

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I shook my head, feeling the weight of their eyes.

*“That’s great,”* the Comedian said, his grin spreading wider. *“Because we’re about to put on a show for you.”*

The joker and his harlequin of a girlfriend started their little act, bouncing around like they were in some cheesy comedy show. The *“jokes”* they were throwing out were awkward and cringe, not even close to being funny. I could barely stomach it.

Their laughter rang through the basement like they thought they were killing it, but I wasn’t amused. This wasn’t comedy. It felt more like they were trying to break me with their stupidity. Every over-the-top gesture and every forced punchline made my skin crawl.

Is this their idea of torture?

Then, they pulled out knives, and the real “show” was about to start. The Comedian’s grin widened like he’d been waiting for this moment.

*“Time to make you smile,”* he said, his voice sickeningly sweet.

I knew what was coming. They didn’t need to say it. The knives gleamed under the dim light, sharp and ready. They were going to carve into my face like a pumpkin and twist it into some grotesque, bleeding smile.

I tried not to think about it, but the thought crawled under my skin. They were going to make me grin, whether I wanted to or not.

I closed my eyes for a second, just to block out the nightmare, and deep down, I prayed. I prayed for someone… anyone… to pull me out of this hell, but nothing came.

Then I felt it. The cold steel of the woman’s knife scraped against my skin, and before I could react, it cut deep into my cheek. The pain exploded through me, sharp and fiery, and I couldn’t stop the scream that tore out of my throat.

The Comedian just stood there, arms wide, savoring every second of my suffering like he was at a show. He watched me squirm, his twisted grin stretching even wider.

Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, it happened. A crash—loud enough to shake the walls. The door to the basement flew off its hinges, splintering into pieces as something massive stepped through.

It wasn’t human. Not even close. This thing was huge, its form more **bat** than **man**, with wings spread wide and dark, leathery skin stretched tight over powerful muscles.

The Comedian and his harlequin froze, their twisted smiles faltering as they turned to face the new arrival. But me? I couldn’t do anything but watch as my so-called savior, this monstrous demon, stood between me and my tormentors.

The bat demon snarled, its wings flapping hard enough to send a gust of wind through the basement. With a roar, it lunged at the Comedian, its claws swiping through the air. The Comedian barely dodged, his laugh turning into a panicked shout as he scrambled backward, his bat raised in defense.

The harlequin wasn’t much better off. She swung her knife, aiming for the demon’s throat, but it was like trying to stab through stone. The bat demon swatted her aside like she was nothing, sending her crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.

The Comedian retaliated, swinging his crowbar with wild abandon. The bat demon caught it mid-swing, crushing the wood in its grip before tossing the Comedian across the room like a ragdoll.

As chaos erupted, I saw him— the kid from earlier. The one who’d warned me to run. He stepped through the wreckage, wearing a robin-like costume, his eyes scanning the scene with quick, practiced focus.

“You okay?” he asked, his voice surprisingly calm, considering the madness around us.

I shook my head, too disoriented to form words.

The kid nodded, his expression softening. 

*“I’m taking you to the hospital,”* he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

He reached out, pulling me up, and though my legs felt like jelly, I managed to stay on my feet. The bat demon and the clowns were still tearing each other apart, but the kid didn’t flinch, moving with purpose as he guided me toward the door.

The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital, the smell of antiseptic and the steady beeping of machines filling the quiet. I don’t remember much after the kid pulled me out of that hellhole, but I woke up safe, the chaos and pain just a distant memory now.

A few days later, I got an anonymous letter. It was short, to the point.

*""You’re safe. Don’t worry about the clowns any more.""*

That was it. No name, no explanation. Just those words.

Months have passed, and the scar on my cheek is healing. It’s still there, a permanent reminder of everything, but it doesn’t hurt anymore. I try not to think about it, not to look back. It’s in the past.

I’ve heard the rumors. People say the clowns are still out there, still on the run. Maybe it’s true. Maybe not. I try not to care. It’s just a whisper now, fading away into the noise of the world. I hope it stays that way.

I was once stalked by a comedian who laughed at his own jokes.

I tried not to think about it, but the thought crawled under my skin. They were going to make me grin, whether I wanted to or not.

I closed my eyes for a second, just to block out the nightmare, and deep down, I prayed. I prayed for someone… anyone… to pull me out of this hell, but nothing came.

Then I felt it. The cold steel of the woman’s knife scraped against my skin, and before I could react, it cut deep into my cheek. The pain exploded through me, sharp and fiery, and I couldn’t stop the scream that tore out of my throat.

The Comedian just stood there, arms wide, savoring every second of my suffering like he was at a show. He watched me squirm, his twisted grin stretching even wider.

Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, it happened. A crash—loud enough to shake the walls. The door to the basement flew off its hinges, splintering into pieces as something massive stepped through.

It wasn’t human. Not even close. This thing was huge, its form more **bat** than **man**, with wings spread wide and dark, leathery skin stretched tight over powerful muscles.

The Comedian and his harlequin froze, their twisted smiles faltering as they turned to face the new arrival. But me? I couldn’t do anything but watch as my so-called savior, this monstrous demon, stood between me and my tormentors.

The bat demon snarled, its wings flapping hard enough to send a gust of wind through the basement. With a roar, it lunged at the Comedian, its claws swiping through the air. The Comedian barely dodged, his laugh turning into a panicked shout as he scrambled backward, his bat raised in defense.

The harlequin wasn’t much better off. She swung her knife, aiming for the demon’s throat, but it was like trying to stab through stone. The bat demon swatted her aside like she was nothing, sending her crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.

The Comedian retaliated, swinging his crowbar with wild abandon. The bat demon caught it mid-swing, crushing the wood in its grip before tossing the Comedian across the room like a ragdoll.

As chaos erupted, I saw him— the kid from earlier. The one who’d warned me to run. He stepped through the wreckage, wearing a robin-like costume, his eyes scanning the scene with quick, practiced focus.

“You okay?” he asked, his voice surprisingly calm, considering the madness around us.

I shook my head, too disoriented to form words.

The kid nodded, his expression softening. 

*“I’m taking you to the hospital,”* he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

He reached out, pulling me up, and though my legs felt like jelly, I managed to stay on my feet. The bat demon and the clowns were still tearing each other apart, but the kid didn’t flinch, moving with purpose as he guided me toward the door.

The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital, the smell of antiseptic and the steady beeping of machines filling the quiet. I don’t remember much after the kid pulled me out of that hellhole, but I woke up safe, the chaos and pain just a distant memory now.

A few days later, I got an anonymous letter. It was short, to the point.

*""You’re safe. Don’t worry about the clowns any more.""*

That was it. No name, no explanation. Just those words.

Months have passed, and the scar on my cheek is healing. It’s still there, a permanent reminder of everything, but it doesn’t hurt anymore. I try not to think about it, not to look back. It’s in the past.

I’ve heard the rumors. People say the clowns are still out there, still on the run. Maybe it’s true. Maybe not. I try not to care. It’s just a whisper now, fading away into the noise of the world. I hope it stays that way.

I was once stalked by a comedian who laughed at his own jokes.

*“Why so serious?”* He mocks me.

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I can’t forget his face—skin pale, almost sickly, with a yellowish tint. Black streaks curve from the corners of his mouth, an exaggerated grin like something from a twisted children’s book. His eyes shine with something that isn’t humor.

Why me? Just a sales clerk peddling overpriced meds. Stuff people might not even need, but they buy it anyway. He’s right, though. I don’t laugh. I barely smile. Maybe I should. Maybe he sees something I can’t.

It was October 12th when everything went sideways. I was heading home, taking my usual route, but somehow ended up somewhere I shouldn’t. That’s when I saw it—a scene that felt like a circus, but way darker.

This guy in a sharp purple suit was the kind that screams trouble. Next to him, a woman decked out in this loud yellow-and-black outfit, like some twisted clown. Both of them had baseball bats resting on their shoulders. In the alley, a kid was crumpled on the ground, black and blue, and barely moving. They had him cornered, and the look in their eyes said this was just the warm-up.

I reached for my phone, but the woman turned before I could even unlock it. Her movements were too smooth, almost unnatural like a snake catching a scent. Her sharp eyes locked onto me, and she let out a scream. *“Jay-Jay!”*

The guy spun around, and his gaze pinned me in place. Those eyes weren’t just looking—they were ripping right through me, sharp and cold, like a bullet tearing through flesh. I couldn’t breathe.

*“Run…”* The boy in the alley barely got the word out, his voice too weak to carry, but I caught it on his lips.

*“Hey, look, Queenie!”* the man jeered, his grin widening as he nudged her with his bat. *“Our boy-wonder here still has some fight in him!”* 

His attention snapped back to the kid like I didn’t even exist anymore.

The woman smirked, her slender body twisting toward the boy, her movements disturbingly fluid.

I didn’t wait. I turned and bolted, my heart pounding louder than my footsteps.

I never found out what happened to that boy. But in the days that followed, something changed.

At work, I caught myself glancing over my shoulder too often. Every reflection in a window felt like it moved when I didn’t. In the quiet moments, I’d swear I heard footsteps matching mine.

Once, leaving the office late, I felt it… a presence, close enough to make my skin crawl. I spun around, but the street was empty, just shadows stretching under flickering lights.

By the time I got home, my hands shook as I locked the door. Every creak in the walls felt louder, like someone was just out of sight, waiting.

A knock came just as I was about to settle in. It wasn’t loud, but it echoed in the quiet, setting my nerves on edge.

I shuffled to the door, hesitating for a second before opening it. The street was mostly empty, except for a blonde woman walking away, her silhouette fading under the streetlights at the far end of the block.

That’s when I noticed the flowers. A bright, almost garish bouquet sitting right there on my porch. My stomach tightened as I picked them up, fingers brushing against the note tied to the stems.

*“With love, From Jay and Harleen.”*

My heart dropped, thudding hard enough to make my chest ache. It’s them. How did they know where I live? Fear crept in, cold and heavy, but underneath it—just a flicker—was something else. Something I didn’t expect.

Grim excitement.

Before the clowns, before the bloody kid in the alley, life was... nothing. A dull, endless loop.

I was the guy no one noticed. No friends, no dates, no texts blowing up my phone. Just me. Always me. School was—elementary, high school, college—the same story. I showed up, did what I had to do, and left. Nobody cared, and honestly, neither did I.

Work wasn’t any different. I buried myself in the job, pushing meds no one really needed. People came and went, and I just stayed. Invisible. I told myself it didn’t matter. Making friends? Not my thing. Social skills? Forget it.

Days melted into weeks, weeks into years. 30 years spent the same way: selling pills, scarfing down junk food, and going to bed. It was easy, predictable, and dead quiet.

Now I’ve got flowers I didn’t ask for. From people I never want to see again. And somehow, for the first time in years, I laughed. Not because it was funny—because it was ridiculous. Being stalked by clowns? What even is my life right now?

I didn’t know what else to do, so I called the cops. Told them about *“Jay-Jay and Harleen.”* They didn’t take me seriously, not really, but they did tell me to be careful.

Apparently, there’s been talk about a pair of serial killers in town. No solid evidence, though—just whispers and rumors. Great. Just what I needed to hear.

The decision was easy: I had to get out. I started scraping together every penny I could, cutting back on everything. No more takeout, no more late-night snacks, just instant noodles and black coffee. My savings grew, slowly but steadily.

But tonight, hunger got the better of me. My stomach growled like it was fighting back against the plan. I grabbed my jacket and headed to the convenience store down the street.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as I wandered the aisles, tossing a sandwich and a bag of chips into my basket. I paid, stuffed the food into my jacket, and stepped out into the cold night.

That’s when I heard it… a faint shuffle behind me.

Before I could turn, something hard smashed into the back of my skull. Pain shot through my head, bright and sharp, and then everything went black.

I woke up in some basement, tied to a chair. My head throbbed, my vision fuzzy, but I didn’t panic. I didn’t gasp or scream. I just focused on figuring out how the hell to get out of this.

Then, I heard footsteps. Down the stairs, here came the Comedian and his girlfriend, looking like they stepped out of some twisted circus.

*“Why so serious?”* He mocks me.

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I shook my head, feeling the weight of their eyes.

*“That’s great,”* the Comedian said, his grin spreading wider. *“Because we’re about to put on a show for you.”*

The joker and his harlequin of a girlfriend started their little act, bouncing around like they were in some cheesy comedy show. The *“jokes”* they were throwing out were awkward and cringe, not even close to being funny. I could barely stomach it.

Their laughter rang through the basement like they thought they were killing it, but I wasn’t amused. This wasn’t comedy. It felt more like they were trying to break me with their stupidity. Every over-the-top gesture and every forced punchline made my skin crawl.

Is this their idea of torture?

Then, they pulled out knives, and the real “show” was about to start. The Comedian’s grin widened like he’d been waiting for this moment.

*“Time to make you smile,”* he said, his voice sickeningly sweet.

I knew what was coming. They didn’t need to say it. The knives gleamed under the dim light, sharp and ready. They were going to carve into my face like a pumpkin and twist it into some grotesque, bleeding smile.

We chat probably once daily but the conversations are of quality. On day 1 (we had a few back and forth messages), I mentioned to him that I had recently got out of a relationship and despite that he was interested to see where this would go. He complimented my personality and said it was promising. A few days later, I had suggested to move off the app as I was finding the pace of conversation to be quite slow (he would reply once a day, didn’t hear from him over the weekend but he did reply on Monday apologising for late response and sharing what he got up to over the weekend). We now chat on WhatsApp but the frequency is still the same. He has asked to meet on the weekend for the first time though for coffee.

The decision was easy: I had to get out. I started scraping together every penny I could, cutting back on everything. No more takeout, no more late-night snacks, just instant noodles and black coffee. My savings grew, slowly but steadily.

But tonight, hunger got the better of me. My stomach growled like it was fighting back against the plan. I grabbed my jacket and headed to the convenience store down the street.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as I wandered the aisles, tossing a sandwich and a bag of chips into my basket. I paid, stuffed the food into my jacket, and stepped out into the cold night.

That’s when I heard it… a faint shuffle behind me.

Before I could turn, something hard smashed into the back of my skull. Pain shot through my head, bright and sharp, and then everything went black.

I woke up in some basement, tied to a chair. My head throbbed, my vision fuzzy, but I didn’t panic. I didn’t gasp or scream. I just focused on figuring out how the hell to get out of this.

Then, I heard footsteps. Down the stairs, here came the Comedian and his girlfriend, looking like they stepped out of some twisted circus.

*“Why so serious?”* He mocks me.

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I shook my head, feeling the weight of their eyes.

*“That’s great,”* the Comedian said, his grin spreading wider. *“Because we’re about to put on a show for you.”*

The joker and his harlequin of a girlfriend started their little act, bouncing around like they were in some cheesy comedy show. The *“jokes”* they were throwing out were awkward and cringe, not even close to being funny. I could barely stomach it.

Their laughter rang through the basement like they thought they were killing it, but I wasn’t amused. This wasn’t comedy. It felt more like they were trying to break me with their stupidity. Every over-the-top gesture and every forced punchline made my skin crawl.

Is this their idea of torture?

Then, they pulled out knives, and the real “show” was about to start. The Comedian’s grin widened like he’d been waiting for this moment.

*“Time to make you smile,”* he said, his voice sickeningly sweet.

I knew what was coming. They didn’t need to say it. The knives gleamed under the dim light, sharp and ready. They were going to carve into my face like a pumpkin and twist it into some grotesque, bleeding smile.

I tried not to think about it, but the thought crawled under my skin. They were going to make me grin, whether I wanted to or not.

I closed my eyes for a second, just to block out the nightmare, and deep down, I prayed. I prayed for someone… anyone… to pull me out of this hell, but nothing came.

Then I felt it. The cold steel of the woman’s knife scraped against my skin, and before I could react, it cut deep into my cheek. The pain exploded through me, sharp and fiery, and I couldn’t stop the scream that tore out of my throat.

The Comedian just stood there, arms wide, savoring every second of my suffering like he was at a show. He watched me squirm, his twisted grin stretching even wider.

Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, it happened. A crash—loud enough to shake the walls. The door to the basement flew off its hinges, splintering into pieces as something massive stepped through.

It wasn’t human. Not even close. This thing was huge, its form more **bat** than **man**, with wings spread wide and dark, leathery skin stretched tight over powerful muscles.

The Comedian and his harlequin froze, their twisted smiles faltering as they turned to face the new arrival. But me? I couldn’t do anything but watch as my so-called savior, this monstrous demon, stood between me and my tormentors.

The bat demon snarled, its wings flapping hard enough to send a gust of wind through the basement. With a roar, it lunged at the Comedian, its claws swiping through the air. The Comedian barely dodged, his laugh turning into a panicked shout as he scrambled backward, his bat raised in defense.

The harlequin wasn’t much better off. She swung her knife, aiming for the demon’s throat, but it was like trying to stab through stone. The bat demon swatted her aside like she was nothing, sending her crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.

The Comedian retaliated, swinging his crowbar with wild abandon. The bat demon caught it mid-swing, crushing the wood in its grip before tossing the Comedian across the room like a ragdoll.

As chaos erupted, I saw him— the kid from earlier. The one who’d warned me to run. He stepped through the wreckage, wearing a robin-like costume, his eyes scanning the scene with quick, practiced focus.

“You okay?” he asked, his voice surprisingly calm, considering the madness around us.

I shook my head, too disoriented to form words.

The kid nodded, his expression softening. 

*“I’m taking you to the hospital,”* he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

He reached out, pulling me up, and though my legs felt like jelly, I managed to stay on my feet. The bat demon and the clowns were still tearing each other apart, but the kid didn’t flinch, moving with purpose as he guided me toward the door.

The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital, the smell of antiseptic and the steady beeping of machines filling the quiet. I don’t remember much after the kid pulled me out of that hellhole, but I woke up safe, the chaos and pain just a distant memory now.

A few days later, I got an anonymous letter. It was short, to the point.

*""You’re safe. Don’t worry about the clowns any more.""*

That was it. No name, no explanation. Just those words.

Months have passed, and the scar on my cheek is healing. It’s still there, a permanent reminder of everything, but it doesn’t hurt anymore. I try not to think about it, not to look back. It’s in the past.

I’ve heard the rumors. People say the clowns are still out there, still on the run. Maybe it’s true. Maybe not. I try not to care. It’s just a whisper now, fading away into the noise of the world. I hope it stays that way.",1,1737441689.0,Horror_stories,0,0.67,False

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I can’t forget his face—skin pale, almost sickly, with a yellowish tint. Black streaks curve from the corners of his mouth, an exaggerated grin like something from a twisted children’s book. His eyes shine with something that isn’t humor.

Why me? Just a sales clerk peddling overpriced meds. Stuff people might not even need, but they buy it anyway. He’s right, though. I don’t laugh. I barely smile. Maybe I should. Maybe he sees something I can’t.

It was October 12th when everything went sideways. I was heading home, taking my usual route, but somehow ended up somewhere I shouldn’t. That’s when I saw it—a scene that felt like a circus, but way darker.

This guy in a sharp purple suit was the kind that screams trouble. Next to him, a woman decked out in this loud yellow-and-black outfit, like some twisted clown. Both of them had baseball bats resting on their shoulders. In the alley, a kid was crumpled on the ground, black and blue, and barely moving. They had him cornered, and the look in their eyes said this was just the warm-up.

I reached for my phone, but the woman turned before I could even unlock it. Her movements were too smooth, almost unnatural like a snake catching a scent. Her sharp eyes locked onto me, and she let out a scream. *“Jay-Jay!”*

The guy spun around, and his gaze pinned me in place. Those eyes weren’t just looking—they were ripping right through me, sharp and cold, like a bullet tearing through flesh. I couldn’t breathe.

*“Run…”* The boy in the alley barely got the word out, his voice too weak to carry, but I caught it on his lips.

*“Hey, look, Queenie!”* the man jeered, his grin widening as he nudged her with his bat. *“Our boy-wonder here still has some fight in him!”* 

His attention snapped back to the kid like I didn’t even exist anymore.

The woman smirked, her slender body twisting toward the boy, her movements disturbingly fluid.

I didn’t wait. I turned and bolted, my heart pounding louder than my footsteps.

I never found out what happened to that boy. But in the days that followed, something changed.

At work, I caught myself glancing over my shoulder too often. Every reflection in a window felt like it moved when I didn’t. In the quiet moments, I’d swear I heard footsteps matching mine.

Once, leaving the office late, I felt it… a presence, close enough to make my skin crawl. I spun around, but the street was empty, just shadows stretching under flickering lights.

By the time I got home, my hands shook as I locked the door. Every creak in the walls felt louder, like someone was just out of sight, waiting.

A knock came just as I was about to settle in. It wasn’t loud, but it echoed in the quiet, setting my nerves on edge.

I shuffled to the door, hesitating for a second before opening it. The street was mostly empty, except for a blonde woman walking away, her silhouette fading under the streetlights at the far end of the block.

That’s when I noticed the flowers. A bright, almost garish bouquet sitting right there on my porch. My stomach tightened as I picked them up, fingers brushing against the note tied to the stems.

*“With love, From Jay and Harleen.”*

My heart dropped, thudding hard enough to make my chest ache. It’s them. How did they know where I live? Fear crept in, cold and heavy, but underneath it—just a flicker—was something else. Something I didn’t expect.

Grim excitement.

Before the clowns, before the bloody kid in the alley, life was... nothing. A dull, endless loop.

I was the guy no one noticed. No friends, no dates, no texts blowing up my phone. Just me. Always me. School was—elementary, high school, college—the same story. I showed up, did what I had to do, and left. Nobody cared, and honestly, neither did I.

Work wasn’t any different. I buried myself in the job, pushing meds no one really needed. People came and went, and I just stayed. Invisible. I told myself it didn’t matter. Making friends? Not my thing. Social skills? Forget it.

Days melted into weeks, weeks into years. 30 years spent the same way: selling pills, scarfing down junk food, and going to bed. It was easy, predictable, and dead quiet.

Now I’ve got flowers I didn’t ask for. From people I never want to see again. And somehow, for the first time in years, I laughed. Not because it was funny—because it was ridiculous. Being stalked by clowns? What even is my life right now?

I didn’t know what else to do, so I called the cops. Told them about *“Jay-Jay and Harleen.”* They didn’t take me seriously, not really, but they did tell me to be careful.

1i6ckmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brunei/comments/1i6ckmr/two_days_for_a_firsttimer_in_brunei/,Two days for a first-timer in Brunei,"Hello, Brunei!

I'm a curious world traveller making his way through the countries, and Brunei has always been a wee straggler on my list. I'm finally making it over next week for a quick two-day jaunt, and I'm looking forward to it.

Luckily for me, I have a friend I went to high school with from Brunei who'll be in BSB when I get in and where I'm staying, so I'll have someone to take/show me around... but I wanted to ask for some tips and 'must-see'/'must-do' suggestions from the locals to maximize the experience. Here are some parameters for guidance:

* I'm into art, history, museums and architecture, so if there are any major museums and galleries that shouldn't be missed or buildings/landmarks/mosques that should be seen, please share away!
* Also a lover of nature and natural vistas; I've heard Kampong Ayer has some pretty neat sights as 'Venice of the East', but also open to other ideas near BSB.
* When it comes to food, I'm a HUGE fan of Asian flavors and spicy things. I'm a strict pescatarian, however, so chicken/meat/land-based animal products \[other than dairy, eggs and honey\] are off the table. If there are local, Bruneian dishes and restaurants that you know of, I'd to know where you all go.
* Are there any fun coffee/brunch spots?
* Budget isn't an issue; nothing extravagant, mind, but otherwise flexible. I also assume that Brunei is fairly plugged in technologically, but will cash be necessary or are cards generally accepted everywhere?
* Silly question: I know the country veers a little more on the conservative side of the spectrum \[I'm from the Middle East, so I can relate\], but are shorts permitted for men, or is it generally better to keep things covered?

Appreciate all your guidance and tips, and very much looking forward to seeing your fascinating city and country! If anyone is also up to grab coffee or walk around, I'd welcome that too.

See you soon!

1i6ckm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1i6ckm6/i_was_once_stalked_by_a_comedian_who_laughed_at/,I was once stalked by a comedian who laughed at his own jokes.,"*“Why so serious?”* He mocks me.

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I can’t forget his face—skin pale, almost sickly, with a yellowish tint. Black streaks curve from the corners of his mouth, an exaggerated grin like something from a twisted children’s book. His eyes shine with something that isn’t humor.

Why me? Just a sales clerk peddling overpriced meds. Stuff people might not even need, but they buy it anyway. He’s right, though. I don’t laugh. I barely smile. Maybe I should. Maybe he sees something I can’t.

It was October 12th when everything went sideways. I was heading home, taking my usual route, but somehow ended up somewhere I shouldn’t. That’s when I saw it—a scene that felt like a circus, but way darker.

This guy in a sharp purple suit was the kind that screams trouble. Next to him, a woman decked out in this loud yellow-and-black outfit, like some twisted clown. Both of them had baseball bats resting on their shoulders. In the alley, a kid was crumpled on the ground, black and blue, and barely moving. They had him cornered, and the look in their eyes said this was just the warm-up.

I reached for my phone, but the woman turned before I could even unlock it. Her movements were too smooth, almost unnatural like a snake catching a scent. Her sharp eyes locked onto me, and she let out a scream. *“Jay-Jay!”*

The guy spun around, and his gaze pinned me in place. Those eyes weren’t just looking—they were ripping right through me, sharp and cold, like a bullet tearing through flesh. I couldn’t breathe.

*“Run…”* The boy in the alley barely got the word out, his voice too weak to carry, but I caught it on his lips.

*“Hey, look, Queenie!”* the man jeered, his grin widening as he nudged her with his bat. *“Our boy-wonder here still has some fight in him!”* 

His attention snapped back to the kid like I didn’t even exist anymore.

The woman smirked, her slender body twisting toward the boy, her movements disturbingly fluid.

I didn’t wait. I turned and bolted, my heart pounding louder than my footsteps.

I never found out what happened to that boy. But in the days that followed, something changed.

At work, I caught myself glancing over my shoulder too often. Every reflection in a window felt like it moved when I didn’t. In the quiet moments, I’d swear I heard footsteps matching mine.

Once, leaving the office late, I felt it… a presence, close enough to make my skin crawl. I spun around, but the street was empty, just shadows stretching under flickering lights.

By the time I got home, my hands shook as I locked the door. Every creak in the walls felt louder, like someone was just out of sight, waiting.

A knock came just as I was about to settle in. It wasn’t loud, but it echoed in the quiet, setting my nerves on edge.

I shuffled to the door, hesitating for a second before opening it. The street was mostly empty, except for a blonde woman walking away, her silhouette fading under the streetlights at the far end of the block.

That’s when I noticed the flowers. A bright, almost garish bouquet sitting right there on my porch. My stomach tightened as I picked them up, fingers brushing against the note tied to the stems.

*“With love, From Jay and Harleen.”*

My heart dropped, thudding hard enough to make my chest ache. It’s them. How did they know where I live? Fear crept in, cold and heavy, but underneath it—just a flicker—was something else. Something I didn’t expect.

Grim excitement.

Before the clowns, before the bloody kid in the alley, life was... nothing. A dull, endless loop.

I was the guy no one noticed. No friends, no dates, no texts blowing up my phone. Just me. Always me. School was—elementary, high school, college—the same story. I showed up, did what I had to do, and left. Nobody cared, and honestly, neither did I.

Work wasn’t any different. I buried myself in the job, pushing meds no one really needed. People came and went, and I just stayed. Invisible. I told myself it didn’t matter. Making friends? Not my thing. Social skills? Forget it.

Days melted into weeks, weeks into years. 30 years spent the same way: selling pills, scarfing down junk food, and going to bed. It was easy, predictable, and dead quiet.

Now I’ve got flowers I didn’t ask for. From people I never want to see again. And somehow, for the first time in years, I laughed. Not because it was funny—because it was ridiculous. Being stalked by clowns? What even is my life right now?

I didn’t know what else to do, so I called the cops. Told them about *“Jay-Jay and Harleen.”* They didn’t take me seriously, not really, but they did tell me to be careful.

Apparently, there’s been talk about a pair of serial killers in town. No solid evidence, though—just whispers and rumors. Great. Just what I needed to hear.

The decision was easy: I had to get out. I started scraping together every penny I could, cutting back on everything. No more takeout, no more late-night snacks, just instant noodles and black coffee. My savings grew, slowly but steadily.

But tonight, hunger got the better of me. My stomach growled like it was fighting back against the plan. I grabbed my jacket and headed to the convenience store down the street.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as I wandered the aisles, tossing a sandwich and a bag of chips into my basket. I paid, stuffed the food into my jacket, and stepped out into the cold night.

That’s when I heard it… a faint shuffle behind me.

Before I could turn, something hard smashed into the back of my skull. Pain shot through my head, bright and sharp, and then everything went black.

I woke up in some basement, tied to a chair. My head throbbed, my vision fuzzy, but I didn’t panic. I didn’t gasp or scream. I just focused on figuring out how the hell to get out of this.

Then, I heard footsteps. Down the stairs, here came the Comedian and his girlfriend, looking like they stepped out of some twisted circus.

*“Why so serious?”* He mocks me.

The ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer. 

*“Smile,”* he says, his words oozing like a command I can’t follow.

I shook my head, feeling the weight of their eyes.

*“That’s great,”* the Comedian said, his grin spreading wider. *“Because we’re about to put on a show for you.”*

The joker and his harlequin of a girlfriend started their little act, bouncing around like they were in some cheesy comedy show. The *“jokes”* they were throwing out were awkward and cringe, not even close to being funny. I could barely stomach it.

Their laughter rang through the basement like they thought they were killing it, but I wasn’t amused. This wasn’t comedy. It felt more like they were trying to break me with their stupidity. Every over-the-top gesture and every forced punchline made my skin crawl.

Is this their idea of torture?

Then, they pulled out knives, and the real “show” was about to start. The Comedian’s grin widened like he’d been waiting for this moment.

*“Time to make you smile,”* he said, his voice sickeningly sweet.

I knew what was coming. They didn’t need to say it. The knives gleamed under the dim light, sharp and ready. They were going to carve into my face like a pumpkin and twist it into some grotesque, bleeding smile.

I tried not to think about it, but the thought crawled under my skin. They were going to make me grin, whether I wanted to or not.

I closed my eyes for a second, just to block out the nightmare, and deep down, I prayed. I prayed for someone… anyone… to pull me out of this hell, but nothing came.

Then I felt it. The cold steel of the woman’s knife scraped against my skin, and before I could react, it cut deep into my cheek. The pain exploded through me, sharp and fiery, and I couldn’t stop the scream that tore out of my throat.

The Comedian just stood there, arms wide, savoring every second of my suffering like he was at a show. He watched me squirm, his twisted grin stretching even wider.

Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, it happened. A crash—loud enough to shake the walls. The door to the basement flew off its hinges, splintering into pieces as something massive stepped through.

It wasn’t human. Not even close. This thing was huge, its form more **bat** than **man**, with wings spread wide and dark, leathery skin stretched tight over powerful muscles.

The Comedian and his harlequin froze, their twisted smiles faltering as they turned to face the new arrival. But me? I couldn’t do anything but watch as my so-called savior, this monstrous demon, stood between me and my tormentors.

The bat demon snarled, its wings flapping hard enough to send a gust of wind through the basement. With a roar, it lunged at the Comedian, its claws swiping through the air. The Comedian barely dodged, his laugh turning into a panicked shout as he scrambled backward, his bat raised in defense.

The harlequin wasn’t much better off. She swung her knife, aiming for the demon’s throat, but it was like trying to stab through stone. The bat demon swatted her aside like she was nothing, sending her crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.

The Comedian retaliated, swinging his crowbar with wild abandon. The bat demon caught it mid-swing, crushing the wood in its grip before tossing the Comedian across the room like a ragdoll.

As chaos erupted, I saw him— the kid from earlier. The one who’d warned me to run. He stepped through the wreckage, wearing a robin-like costume, his eyes scanning the scene with quick, practiced focus.

“You okay?” he asked, his voice surprisingly calm, considering the madness around us.

I shook my head, too disoriented to form words.

The kid nodded, his expression softening. 

*“I’m taking you to the hospital,”* he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

He reached out, pulling me up, and though my legs felt like jelly, I managed to stay on my feet. The bat demon and the clowns were still tearing each other apart, but the kid didn’t flinch, moving with purpose as he guided me toward the door.

The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital, the smell of antiseptic and the steady beeping of machines filling the quiet. I don’t remember much after the kid pulled me out of that hellhole, but I woke up safe, the chaos and pain just a distant memory now.

A few days later, I got an anonymous letter. It was short, to the point.

*""You’re safe. Don’t worry about the clowns any more.""*

That was it. No name, no explanation. Just those words.

Months have passed, and the scar on my cheek is healing. It’s still there, a permanent reminder of everything, but it doesn’t hurt anymore. I try not to think about it, not to look back. It’s in the past.

I’ve heard the rumors. People say the clowns are still out there, still on the run. Maybe it’s true. Maybe not. I try not to care. It’s just a whisper now, fading away into the noise of the world. I hope it stays that way.

My ex essentially dumped me (although a number of reasons have been stated, the initial reason is likely always the honest one they say before your reaction where they rethink it) for being injured and living in chronic pain as a result. Stating maybe we could reconnect/try again when my recovery is better. Then removed all care because he couldn't cope. Before we split, I was at the point of hiding being in pain, trying to always be happy/motivated about my recovery even on days when I thought I can't do this anymore and wanted to breakdown. Usually because he'd tell me my pain is as much mental as physical (which is true) and just dismissing me and telling me to go therapy. 

We only went to events/activities he wanted to go to, drugging me to the eyeballs in pain meds (he's a doctor) to push through. Anything I planned usually got canceled or postponed for rest/recovery. I felt trapped in the four walls of his flat (our old flat together), in a cycle of hiding pain, hiding the disappointment at more cancelled events, or doctors messing around with medication dosages at the risk he'd berate me for going to therapy or being in a bad mood due to pain. I thought none of my friends or people I met would want to be around me, deal with letting me visit when I was reliant on pain meds and some days couldn't do the things we'd planned, high in their homes, setting up equipment on the bed/bathroom to manage whilst away from home, or meeting me for simple things like coffee or hang out at mine, because that's all I could offer. 

Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this. Although I've lost a few friends along the way to this nerve injury, some friends have been incredibly supportive, some are even coming over during my latest flare to help with laundry and small household stuff I can't manage ATM. One came to visit me and we had a great time laughing and joking as he watched my evening pain meds slowly take over, like being drunk teenagers again watching the friend who had a bit too much slur their words. Let me sleep next to him when the pain woke me up in the night and I was exhausted and stressed by it. I felt instantly soothed just being near another human being during a flare now I live alone. My ex had berated me for this at this end, regulating me before I moved out to our spare room and telling me I need cope alone/self soothe everytime I was up in the night with pain. 

During my initial few weeks of being dumped I downloaded dating apps, and ended up swapping numbers with a guy before I deleted them as I didn't feel ready. The closer we got to the ""date"" the more I realised not only mentally I wasn't ready but also physically. I couldn't sit without pain, was reliant on meds from morning through to evening and being hooked to a tens machine all day. After my latest hospital visit in an ambulance, i was too embarrassed to say anything, pretending I'd just had a busy evening and couldn't text. But the morning of our proposed date, when I could barely move, I had to be honest and say my health wasn't in the right place to date right now. 

I doubt I'll hear from him again, but he was really sweet in his response and it (alongside support from my friends) gave me faith in humanity a little after my ex has treated me so cruelly about my injury and chronic pain. He said he was happy to wait until my recovery, and just meet as friends until I felt a bit better and ready, we joked about my special cushion, he googled what a tens was and took an interest in it. And it made me realise that not everyone is going to treat you as a burden/berate you/reject you because of pain. 

I've got 2 friends visiting next month, and spending next week at my childhood best friends house for respite from my flare. The following months, I'm visiting friends in Paris (I live in London) and on the coast. I'm flying overseas later this year for a wedding. I'm still navigating how ill manage all this and preparation, and accepted I may need to cancel/alter plans because of my health. But dammm, it's been easier accepting this with more positive people in my life. For the first time in a long time I feel positive and supported. 🥰",0,1737441163.0,ChronicPain,0,0.33,False

After exchanging messages for a few weeks, we decided to meet up for a casual coffee date. We both seemed excited to finally see each other in person, and the conversation flowed easily as we sipped our drinks.

As we delved into various topics, she suddenly mentioned that she had three children, each with a different father. I was stunned. Throughout all our conversations, she had never mentioned anything about having kids. The revelation caught me off guard, and I struggled to process this new information.

Though I tried to remain composed during the rest of the date, I couldn’t shake the surprise. After we parted ways, I found myself reflecting on the situation. The fact that she hadn't been upfront about such a significant part of her life made me question what else might be hidden. Ultimately, I decided not to pursue further contact.

A week ago I told the story to a coworker and she got upset that I wouldn't date the girl just because she had kids.

Since ive shifted to part time and not a very high income for part time, im more stingy with my money and im more wiser than i used to be few years back. Anyways, I have an exam coming up in few days and I was craving an iced latte in a longg time. Sydney’s cafe prices are on par with its house prices (jk but might as well be) it’s so extremely expensive but i decided to spoil myself a little today. I asked the waitress for a white iced mocha and i know i shouldn’t have but i asked if they had iced hazelnut latte, she said yes and was rushing me to pay saying “it’s the same price just pay” i was like oh okay cool. 

Mind you this is a cafe with a screen at the front so you can see your order while they’re inputting it in the machine. I’m waiting and I saw her pour into a normal coffee cup I asked if it’s iced and she said “no?” i said “i asked for an iced hazelnut” then she tells me that it’s 8.50 (which is an atrocious price but i digress) and she tells me to pay it again. I ask for a refund for the initial “coffee” i paid for, she gives it and tells me to pay 8.50 in full again. 

Now this is like my last 20 bucks (the rest are in savings) and i request she takes the refunded price (she gave it in cash) and i can pay the rest on card (this doesn’t even make sense because im pretty sure eftpos machines at cafes allows you to refund through the screen than cash but maybe this cafe didn’t so that’s why i suggested the idea of splitting) She says that’s fine. 

Then she heads off to the kitchen. I see the machine it still says 8.50 I was calling to her “excuse me? hello?” and I’m guessing she was talking shit because the other waitress saw me and turned to her and whispered “aren’t you gonna serve her? she’s calling you” and the waitress didn’t move and just shrugged her shoulders and the other waitress laughed. She comes back to the counter and starts arguing with me gaslighting me that I asked for “ iced white mocha with hazelnut” I said that’s not what i said at all and proceeded to correct her. She then gives me the coffee anyway and is huffing and puffing saying “it’s fine it’s my mistake”.  Also i should note there wasn’t a line behind me either, I was the only person waiting.

I admit i’ve worked in hospitality before i used to deal with rude customers all the time. But i don’t think i was necessarily wrong here. I admit though if i was “ rich “ like before i probably would’ve just paid the 8.50 on my card but i wasn’t asking for much? if it was difficult for her to split the payment in cash and card I would’ve just taken the refund.

Just not my thing but I have enjoyed some pretty heavily processed coffees. Anyway, I recently got a bag of of el paraíso natural pink bourbon (shout out to airworks) by oasis coffee roasters.i Brewed it using my usual recipes and it was pretty good and I was able to dial it in to get the plum and chocolate to shine through and overpower the funk but that funk note was still there in the background. but I decided to check oasis’s website to see if they had any brew recs. While I always start with my staple recipes I love trying brewer recommended pferamaters to see if it yields a better cup, and I always check to see if a roaster has one.Their recipe was unlike anything I had tried. Med grind, relatively soft water, a cold bloom and a crazy ratio.( coffee to water ratio is 1:12.6 but the actual coffee to brewed liquid ratio is 1:9!) 15g of coffee bloom 45g at 60c. Then at 20s pour 145g of 85c water but then stop the brew after 140g of extraction and ad 10g of water as bypass for a total brew of 150. Definitely a pain in the ass but I gotta say I definitely got the best cup.  Absolutely no funk! Super balanced with crazy chocolate, plum, and passion fruit perfectly

1i6cgr0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6cgr0,Western Conifer Seed Bug Keeping:),"Hi there! I don't really know where else to put this lol, but I've recently started caring for a western conifer seed bug and the only place I could find info on possible care guidelines was a thread on here from 5 years ago (I'll see if I can find it again and link it here) so I wanted to share my experience and take others with me on this journey! (Seriously any additional tips or suggestions you might have about caring for this little guy would be greatly appreciated 😅). 

Quick background:
So I'm in NB, Canada, and it's currently freezing cold and snowy outside. At work the other day I saw a little bug on the wall near the door, so I caught it with the intentions of releasing it back outside, but I didn't want it to freeze and ended up temporarily putting him in an old coffee cup. I spent the rest of my shift researching what type of bug it was and as much as I could about him. I've been wanting to get into insect and spider keeping for a year or so now so the idea of taking the little guy (who I've come to assume is a young adult who was looking for a place to overwinter) home until the weather is nice enough to release him in about a month or so, came to mind. 

The set up:
So now I have Jeremy, my little buddy! He's currently living in an old No Name™️ coffee jar (idk how big it is but it held 300g of instant coffee lol) with lots of holes poked in the lid until I can get somesort of actual vertical space terrarium. All the research I did said that this species mainly hangs out and eats pine tree stuff but my property actually has no pine trees so until I can  go somewhere else to get some, I gave him some branches, twigs, and cones from a few different other conifers trees like red spruce and fir. I tried to give him a few different parts of each because I wasn't entirely sure if they just needed the sap or not and I wanted him to have things to climb. I'm scared of feeding him too much or too little, or not providing everything he needs in his diet so once every couple days I give him some watered down honey. I've only had him a few days but I lightly misted the jar when I first put him in. I didn't think a humid environment would be necessary but the air here is super dry right now and I don't know how much water these lil dudes need (or if they need any at all). I've seen him drink a bit of both the honey water and water mist. 

Experience:
So far my experience with these little guys have been great; Jeremy seems to be happy and active! He moves around the jar with his cute Lil walk and has even ""drilled"" tiny holes in some twigs. He also seems super curious and ""watches me' through the jar, moving his little antenna thingys. When I was putting together his jar he walked around on my hand an arm watching for a while. I read that this species will let off an almond like scent when they feel threatened but i havent smelt it yet so, fingers crossed, he isn't stressed😅🤞 Hopefully everything keeps going well for Jeremy until he can be let back outside! Thanks for coming along on this journey with me and If there's any updates I'll let yall know lol. If you have any suggestions, tips, or questions on caring for about Jeremy, please let me know!😊",2,1737440788.0,InvertPets,1,1.0,False

- **Open Shelving:** Open shelves not only serve as functional storage but also showcase charming dishware and pantry items, adding a personal touch.
- **Vintage Accents:** Using retro appliances or antique decorations can enhance the whimsical charm of the cottage aesthetic.
- **Cozy Textiles:** Soft fabrics, such as checked or floral-patterned linens, add warmth and comfort to the kitchen space.

A cottage home kitchen often encourages a sense of togetherness, where friends and family can gather, cook, and share stories. This inviting atmosphere is further enriched by incorporating elements such as a farmhouse sink, a large dining table, and plenty of natural light streaming in through quaint windows.

Ultimately, designing a cottage home kitchen involves blending functionality with aesthetic appeal, ensuring that every element works together to create a space that feels both beautiful and welcoming.

# Styling Tips for Casual Looks

1. **Pair with Flats or Sneakers** For a laid-back and comfortable outfit, pair your tear floral dress with flats or white sneakers. This combination is perfect for running errands, casual coffee dates, or a relaxed day out with friends. Add a crossbody bag and minimal jewelry to complete the look.
2. **Layer with a Denim Jacket** A denim jacket is a timeless layering piece that complements the floral patterns of your dress. Whether it’s a sunny spring day or a crisp autumn afternoon, this pairing adds a casual vibe while keeping you warm.
3. **Accessorize with a Straw Hat** If you’re heading to a picnic or a beach outing, a straw hat can elevate your outfit instantly. It not only adds a touch of boho-chic but also provides sun protection, making it both stylish and practical.

# Styling Tips for Formal Looks

1. **Elevate with Heels** Transform your tear floral dress into a formal outfit by pairing it with strappy heels or pointed-toe pumps. Opt for neutral or metallic tones to maintain a sophisticated look. This is an excellent choice for evening events or semi-formal gatherings.
2. **Add Statement Jewelry** Bold accessories, such as chandelier earrings or a chunky necklace, can add a glamorous touch to your dress. Ensure that the jewelry complements the floral patterns without overpowering the overall look.
3. **Incorporate a Blazer** For a polished appearance, layer your dress with a tailored blazer. Choose a solid color that matches the hues in your dress. This combination works well for office parties or formal luncheons, where you want to strike a balance between elegance and professionalism.

# Seasonal Adaptations for Tear Floral Dresses

* **Spring and Summer:** Opt for tear floral dresses in lightweight fabrics like cotton or chiffon. Bright and pastel colors with smaller floral prints are ideal for these seasons. Pair them with open-toe sandals and delicate jewelry for a breezy look.
* **Autumn and Winter:** Choose dresses in darker tones and heavier fabrics like velvet or satin. Layer with tights, ankle boots, and a trench coat or cardigan for a cozy yet chic outfit. Adding a scarf can also enhance your winter ensemble.

Also curious what an average cost should be? Standard items being moved - king size bed, couch, coffee table, entertainment center, and debating moving a dining room table. Reached out to 1 company and they quoted me at ~$1000 which seems somewhat high but with the caveat that if I don’t end up taking any of the items, they don’t charge for it. FWIW, I have a car and will be taking the smaller items I can pack (Clothes, computer equipment, etc).",2,1737440438.0,jerseycity,2,1.0,False
1i6cd3m,https://i.redd.it/gkj42mkaiaee1.png,Your favourite moments playing the game? What little things do you like about sso?,"This is completely random but I'm curious to know what are something of the little things you like about the game? Is there any nice moments that stick out to you? 

I was walking through Jarlaheim yesterday, kinda just lost in thought and there was a player running around on foot doing quests and their horse was running behind them. It genuinely looked so cute. Yes, I've seen it before but there was just something about it this time that was especially adorable. It reminded me of videos of little puppies with their lil legs, running after their owners. It made me really appreciate that game mechanic 😂

Does anyone else people watch in game sometimes? If I'm taking a little coffee break or doing something else on the side, I'll just sit and watch what's going on around me. I've never been one to RP, I like the idea of it but couldn't get into it and I'll admit it can get annoying sometimes. But every now and then I'll catch a sweet moment, even though they aren't real horses, it's so wholesome seeing a player interact so kindly with their in game steed. It makes me nostalgic. When I was a kid I'd collect horse figures, I made a whole ass barn, arena and pastures for them. They were spoiled and treated as if they were real horses. Seeing that in game, as cringy as it can be sometimes, it's very sweet 😂
