1i7v2e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1i7v2e0/messed_up_but_second_chance/,Messed Up but Second Chance,"Hey everyone, So l asked out a girl l've liked for awhile back in October we both liked each other but I got nervous and asked bluntly which I think made her a little nervous. She said Yes and later on we exchanged numbers and grabbed coffee. The day we grabbed coffee though I messed up big time I was dressed in casual clothes (khaki shorts,and a t shirt) while she was in a nice dress. She made it seem like it'd be more of a casual hangout. I also got there specifically on time while it seemed like she was there for awhile. Anyways I was extremely nervous and was not acting like myself almost the whole time without realizing it was because I rushed things because I broke up with a long-term girlfriend (2 1/2 years) only two weeks before we grabbed coffee. She asked an important question as well that I did not realize at the time was something important to her in a relationship and I basically rushed my answer out. Essentially, I messed up big time and was not acting like myself. A day later she texted basically saying ""Hey thanks for your time out of your day, l've been thinking about but let's just stay as friends and I hope that doesn't ruin anything"". Since then, l've vastly improved my life both physically (lost 65 los), mentally (being more thoughtful and calm), and spiritually (something that was related to that important question I accidentally dodged). I think she's noticed it too as she's gone up and talked to me in a group setting. I can't help but feel a sense of regret knowing I shouldn't have rushed things with her since then, I'm not obsessive or anything but I don't like how I left things. I was thinking of apologizing to her and essentially saying
""Hey II, I hope you're doing great! I've been thinking about it a lot and I want to apologize for how I left things back in October, l've realized for awhile nc V was not acting like myself and more importantly rushed things with you without contemplating a recent breakup I went through at the time. It is it totally fine if you don't want to, but I was wondering if you'd like to hangout (just as friends) and go from there. You're not going to hurt my feelings if you don't want to and this will not affect our friendship whatsoever. I just wanted to ask cause I don't like how I left things."" What do you all think?

1i7v1l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1i7v1l0/red_flag_walking_i_guess/,"red flag walking, i guess","I (29F) turn 30 this year, and I don't have close connections to anyone outside of my family. 

I have no friends, either IRL or online, and have never been on a date. I don't even know where I would start in an attempt to not be lonely and, for lack of a better phrase, 'better my life.' I work fully remote and rarely leave my house. I don't drink alcohol, I don't drink coffee, and I don't like most food (thanks, ARFID!), which makes it hard for me to go out and linger in public spaces or even arrange a meet-up. What would anyone do with someone who's habits nix a majority of ""get to know each other"" activities?

I'm awful at responding to messages because of a heady combination of anxiety and ADHD, so even when people do reach out in an attempt to talk to me, I tend to fudge it up because their messages sit unread and unresponded to for days, and by the time I finally remember, I'm too ashamed of myself to respond. 

When I do have moments where I think I've built up the courage to change something, to try and reach out, to do anything about my situation, there's a voice in my head (and several loud ones on the internet) that tell me that at my age, the things I don't have (friends, a dating history, etc) are red flags. Which, you know, I get. 

I have mostly resigned myself to being alone for the rest of my life. I have my parents and my dogs, but I know that even that's not going to last and I'll likely die as someone whose neighbors only knew them periphally. 🫠",3,1737605405.0,ForeverAlone,0,1.0,False

The irony of using such ancient technology for surveillance wasn't lost on him. Like watching fish in an aquarium, except he was the one in the tank. His eyes tracked each passing figure with the intensity of a caffeine-deprived grad student spotting the last coffee pod in the break room.

Something was wrong. His gut had been performing Olympic-level gymnastics since he'd dragged himself out of bed that morning, the kind of instinctive warning that had saved his work more times than he cared to count. Some called him paranoid; he preferred ""professionally suspicious.""

""What the hell is it?"" he whispered to himself.

Kali breezed past. Her trench coat doing its best impression of a rain-soaked cat, water droplets falling in orderly lines across the floor as she raced in a brisk walk. She hung it by her cubicle. Like a heat-seeking missile, she made a beeline for the kitchen. There was no pause in her pace, not even an attempt to recognize anyone or anything in her way. Everyone knew her routine and unintentionally made way for her zombie state.

Ah yes, the sacred coffee ritual.

She was one of the rare specimens who hadn't succumbed to the siren call of free company housing. While the rest of them played house in their corporate-funded apartments, himself included for the past five years, she maintained her wild existence in the outside world. The thought almost made him smile. Almost.

His eyes narrowed as she performed her daily ritual with clockwork precision: the prescribed pause at Michael's desk, exactly 2.3 minutes of small talk, the regulation glare at Jennifer, duration: 5.2 seconds, followed by the ceremonial coffee sipping while pretending to read system briefs.

Jin-woo turned back to his monitor, the tower beneath his desk humming like a contented cat. Everything was normal, painfully, suspiciously normal. Which, of course, made it all the more unsettling. His hands pressed against his eyes until geometric patterns danced in the darkness. He'd sooner eat a keyboard than sit idle while his life's work hung in the balance.

I’m going crazy.

Rising from his chair with the determination of a man who'd had exactly too much coffee, he began his patrol of the facility. His chair was left sprawled on the ground. The symphony of technology surrounded him, servers whispering their binary secrets, techs murmuring in their native tongue of acronyms and jargon, and there, at the heart of it all, stood his masterpiece. His life work. The child he had raised from little.

Demina's central monitor loomed before him, endless streams of code cascading like a digital waterfall. Two decades of his life, translated into an AI system that had become more than just circuits and algorithms. He ghosted past the respectful nods and greetings, his feet navigating the obstacle course that was their floor, a modern art installation of tangled cables, abandoned cups, and chairs that had forgotten their original positions.

The massive room spread out like a techno-organic landscape. Rows of desks sprouted monitors displaying neural network activity, a light show that would put the aurora borealis to shame. Greens, blues, and purples wove together in a dance that made his mathematician's heart skip a beat. The cosmos, recreated in data. Centralized galaxies and solar systems revolving around a generational task.

He'd walked this path countless times, but the wonder never faded. Each visit revealed new details in the organized chaos, coffee cups bearing lipstick marks like fossil records of late-night coding sessions, energy bar wrappers in various states of consumption, from ""barely touched"" to ""devoured in desperation”, and sticky notes that told stories of their own. Mathematical equations that he could solve faster than most people could read them, and his personal favorite, a note simply stating ""sleep eventually"" with the ""eventually"" underlined three times.

That last one always brought a smile to his face. His team's dedication to Demina matched his own obsession, they were all proud parents of this digital prodigy, lost in their shared creation of something extraordinary.

The sharp scent of ozone tickled his nose, a familiar comfort that reminded him of late nights and early mornings bent over keyboards, chasing digital dreams. The metallic tang in the air was as much a part of the lab as the endless hum of servers or the flickering fluorescent lights that cast their sterile glow across his domain. Those lights had been threatening to give up for months now, but like everything else in the lab, they stubbornly persisted in their duty. He noted to have them replaced some time next week.

Jin-woo's footsteps found the squeaky floorboard near Server Bank C, an old friend that had announced his midnight wanderings for years. He knew this place like a musician knows their instrument, every imperfection and quirk cataloged in his mental repository. The whining fan in Server 342, which somehow managed to sound like a distant cat. The perpetually dark corner by the emergency exit where the light never quite reached. The exact spot where the temperature dropped three degrees due to the ancient AC unit's peculiar distribution pattern.

His fingers traced the edge of a whiteboard, muscle memory taking him to the exact spot where they'd made their first major breakthrough. The equations were long gone, replaced by newer puzzles and problems, but he could still see them in his mind. They were clear as the day they'd cracked the speech recognition algorithm. 99% accuracy. The board had nearly cracked under the pressure of their celebratory high-fives that day.

Jin-woo allowed himself a wisp of a smile.

""You're seriously doing this again?"" he muttered to himself. He recognized the familiar spiral of nostalgia. But he couldn't help it. Each milestone with Demina felt like watching his own child grow. From those first hesitant steps of basic pattern recognition to the sprint of complex problem-solving that left even him breathless. Just like his own mother had been with his photos and videos, as much as he hated it.

The lights flickered again, as if sharing his moment of reflection. Or maybe they were judging him for spending another weekend here, his phone deliberately set to silent in his desk drawer. He couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten something that hadn't come from a vending machine or been delivered by someone judging his life choices through their eyes.

Was this ambition or addiction? The line had blurred somewhere between the third energy drink of the night and the fourth breakthrough of the month. His dedication to Demina had long since passed professional interest and ventured into the territory of obsession, the kind that made normal people raise eyebrows and fellow scientists nod in understanding. Jin-woo used to wonder when he would ever find something that would be his passion, expectation brought him to believe it would never happen.

I’m a lucky man.

The familiar weight of responsibility settled on his shoulders as he watched the neural network patterns dance across the screens. Each success only pushed him further, demanded more from him. He was no longer sure if he was chasing excellence or if excellence was chasing him. He knew one thing with certainty, that gnawing feeling in his gut wasn't going away, and neither was he until he figured out what was triggering his internal alarm system.

Jin-woo was about to continue his patrol when a soft beep from his workstation caught his attention, barely louder than a whisper, but to his trained ear, it might as well have been a thunderclap. The kind of sound that made his coffee-addled brain cells stand at attention. Nothing beeped out of pattern, no flicker happened without it being premeditated.

""Oh, you've got to be kidding me,"" he cursed before rushing back to his office. He picked the fallen chair, it protested with a squeak as he dropped into it without any propriety. A few clicks later and his monitor displayed what appeared to be standard core logs, but there, just at the edge of his vision, a flicker. Like a shadow in peripheral vision. Gone when you turn to look at it directly. As though something was trying to hide it.

He leaned forward, fingers flying across the keyboard with practiced precision. ""Come on, show me what you're hiding."" The logs expanded, and his stomach performed an impressive acrobatic routine as segments of code twisted before his eyes, transforming into corrupted gibberish. “Oh no…”

""Dr. Park?"" Kali's voice cut through his focus. She stood in his doorway, another coffee cup in hand, her eyes narrowing at his expression, dark bags telling a tale of lacking sleep. ""You look like someone just deleted your backup drives.""

""Worse,"" he replied, not looking up. Fingers punching letters on the keyboard with impressive speed honed by decades of experience. ""Remember that experimental self-learning algorithm I've been working on?""

""The one you said would 'revolutionize data processing as we know it'?"" She made air quotes with her free hand. A habit that usually annoyed him but currently seemed trivial compared to the disaster unfolding on his screen. Every older member of this project and a thousand other projects wanted to ‘revolutionize’ the field. Leave their mark on the world. It was so common it had become a running gag within the younger circles.

""That's the one."" He gestured her over. Then pointing at the corrupted sections. They were expanding at an increasing rate. ""Look at this. The system's rewriting itself, but not in any way I programmed it to.""

Kali walked around his desk and set her coffee down on his desk. Too close to the edge, another pet peeve of his, but he ignored it. More important things were at hand than the potential of her spilling a steaming hot cup of coffee all over important files, towers, and himself. She leaned over his shoulder. Her usual playful demeanor vanished as she processed what she was seeing.

""That's... not good.""

""Your talent for understatement never fails to impress,"" Jin-woo said dryly. He pulled up another window, fingers dancing across the keyboard. ""The algorithm was designed to refine its own logic, adapt faster than standard AI systems. But this..."" He trailed off as another section of code mutated before their eyes. Its purpose unknown to him.

""Dr. Park,"" Kali's voice had taken on an edge he rarely heard. “Please tell me this isn't connected to the main system.""

He’s nearly convinced that the doctor had made an accident, and couldn’t understand the difference between fraternal and identical twins. How could his identical twin be some hopeless, tactless and worst of all lovesick idiot! He was the mature one, the clearheaded one, the one who cleans up everyone’s God forsaken mess. He should then have a brother who was just like him in that regard, but instead they gave him another reason to jump off a bridge. 

Clint is questioning why he ever found Flint in that grocery store when he could have easily left him meandering around the candy aisle. Clint has been unable to get into his room for the past hour, because Flint is sobbing his little, beady eyes out of his sockets over a damn girl. Much to Clint’s dismay, they share a room. He has suffered from innumerable lock-out’s like this, and unfortunately he knows it will not be his last. 

The tired boy sighs and throws in the towel. He was hoping to play on his 3DS today, but when life gives you rain you have no choice but to drown. He walks downstairs utterly defeated, and into their gaudy-looking foyer. Decked out with so many obnoxious lights that one might assume it was the holidays. 

It wasn’t the holidays though, but the end of the school year. Clint’s favorite time of year was spending summer doing nothing but stare at his ceiling for three months straight. The joys of doing nothing was something no one should ever dream of passing up. 

Clint noticed the yearbook sitting on the coffee table of one of the couches. The cover was dawning on the sickly-looking school colors that were green and white. The text was a murky mustard yellow that gave the appearance of a big stain on the front cover. How anyone would want to even touch the yearbook was beyond him. Even as he thought those very thoughts, he still decided to open it. He guessed the only people that looked at it were the few that were stuck locked out of their rooms. 

Clint began to skim through the book. His group of friends he admittedly couldn’t care less about, the school activities kids were dragged into, the one girl that was rumored to have a tapeworm in her body, etc. He truly couldn’t care less about any of the memories. He’s even heard that you end up moving on from school friends once you finish up school. Going onto the next boring batch of bitches to the next. 

His fingers had cramped up around the page the second he saw Elizabeth. She was the girl that Flint had picked weeds off the ground, and gave to her. He even bought her a stupid ring, and proposed in front of the class. She had accepted it, and then asked for a divorce once the ring was on her finger. 

He looked over her photo, and he felt his heart pick up in pace. It was her smiling into the camera for her yearbook photo, and she was completely dolled up for the occasion. Her big blonde curls that looked like they needed a curler to make. Brown eyes are so dark that they seem to have an almost mysterious look to them. Her soft lips didn't have a single crack in them, because of the amount of lip balm she applied on daily. 

It was frustrating, but he could see the appeal in her. In fact, every girl that Flint finds interesting he follows suit in such interest. That’s where it always ends though, he’s not foolish enough to date women that are bound to play him like a fiddle. That is strangely Flint’s type after all. Usually Clint is able to secretively thwart Flint’s plans, but the ring was an unpredictable variable. 

Flint had gone missing one day, and then came back three hours later shrugging his shoulders in response to any question thrown at him. Who would have thought the fool would have gone out and bought a ring! The ring was luckily cheap– a Claire's price sticker was barely ripped off the edge of the ring– but it was still an embarrassing ordeal for Clint. He sighed in deep frustration, and closed up the book. 

Flint was a disaster after disaster that school year. It was giving Clint a headache reading the yearbook, because each picture was moments before the disaster that was named “Flint”. He placed the book down and he felt the unnerving silence that was his home. Although his brother’s heartbroken-self was sobbing like no other, Clint couldn’t hear it on the first floor of the house. 

There were a million useless rooms: multiple different drawing rooms, a golf course, a writing room, an orangery on the highest floor, two different libraries, three different types of pantries storing all different types of food, a wine room, a game room, two mudrooms (one for the front of the house and the other for the back) and the list goes on. Their house felt so vacant because of it, and no matter how much the maids and butlers decorated it’d always feel empty. There were no sounds to be heard in the foyer other than tapping feet of maids going by to do their usual cleaning. Each giving a feeble hello before quickly scuttering past like frightened mice. 

“Miss?” 

A squeak came out of the maid, “Yes, young master Clint?”

He noticed her quickly scampered over, tiny feet dragging over the floor. Although she was much older than him, she felt and looked small. Even turning in on herself so she wouldn’t take up as much space. 

“Could you check on my brother, and ask if he could give me any information on Lizzy.” he couldn’t help but sarcastically draw out the name Elizabeth. It was such a dumb nickname. 

“Oh, but young master he’s upset–”

“Did I stutter?” 

She squeaked out a “No you didn’t, young master” and hurried on her ways up the stairs. He looked worried that she was going to end up tripping and getting a concussion. He noticed that the rest of the servants seemed to pile out of the room not wanting to deal with his antics. He wasn’t like his brother, so he never understood why they were nervous around him yet gentle to a ticking time bomb. Hell, they’d probably hug and kiss said bomb if they could. They love the brat so much to the point it annoys Clint.  

The maid came down with a sniffling Flint. Flint had thanked the maid, who Clint had just learned was named Cynthia, for the handkerchief. Flint then sat down, and blew his nose. Absolutely disgusting. 

“Whaddya want? Can’t you see I’m busy being heartbroken? You don’t get broken up with your ex-wife at the end of the school year everyday!” Flint mumbled it out while the lower part of his face was shoved into the cloth. 

Clint said, “Oh nothing in particular. I was just wondering what exactly her least favorite animal was.”

Every servant in the room flinched and slightly turned towards the two brothers. Although every servant there seemed to be deathly afraid of Clint, they couldn’t help but peep in on the conversation. 

For the people with mundane and ordinary lives this was their only chance to peer through the peephole. Listening to rich idiots complain about zeroth world problems, and watch as they pull stunts off with reckless abandon knowing that money will easily cover the problem off. 

“I don’t like where this is going. I remember the school pool being filled with leeches once for no reason,” Flint had dropped his handkerchief with a pout and directed a glare at his brother. It lost a lot of its bite because his eyes were red, and his nose was still slightly running. 

Clint nodded and said, “And what does that happen to do with my question?”

“Well, that happened after you asked me what the most dangerous thing that could lurk in the water!”

Clint couldn’t help but frown, “Brother, I notice the precarious state you're in is all. I don’t want to leave you upset by reminding you of her.”

Flint almost had taken the bait. Visibly swishing the idea in his head back and forth until his head snapped up in shock. 

“You only use strong vernacular when you’re trying to convince me of something,” Flint got off the couch and pointed directly at him shouting, “I’m not one to be fooled twice, so no I’m not telling you!” 

Clint couldn’t help, but sigh. He was hoping to do this the easy way, but it seemed that his brother was forcing him to dig deeper into something he’d prefer wasn’t a summer project. 

“Is vernacular even a real word..?”

“If you paid attention in class then you would have known~”

~~~

Frogs. 

They are the size of a palm, slow movers and most species are relatively harmless. After doing an extremely humane background check on Little Lizzy he found out that she was practically petrified of frogs. Not scared to death of the green croakers, but if he were to put even one in her house she’d be the antithesis of an agoraphobe. 

He didn’t want his brother to raise suspicions of his plans, so he knew he needed to keep one of his more subdued plans. Not leeches in the pool, but more someone accidentally tripped into a dumpster into a back alley kind of thing. 

He was quite impressed with his own plan, he must admit. He did in fact hang out with Fred by getting ice cream with him. He also had 0.46 kilograms of frogs in common frogs in the back of the trunk packed and stored away. 

He wasn’t able to get them to shut up no matter how hard he tried, and he learned in a very tragic way that frogs don’t live when they're kept in soundproof bottles. He hopes that Flint hadn’t seen the frog grave in their closet yet decked out in fake shrubbery and an overpriced grave. He named it Georgie so that Flint wouldn’t realize it was a weird animal. 

When the maid was about ready to drive the car she had a terrible fright. She shrieked and had to grip the wheel tightly in order to get her breathing back in order. 

She gave a quick look behind her and attempted to speak up in her mousey voice, “Umm, what exactly in the trunk?”

“Contraband,” he said. 

She wanted to speak up, but she decided to refrain from a losing battle. She had used to try, but after finding a shovel filthy with dirt in the back of the car once she mysteriously began to acquiesce. 

Like always, spending time with friends was a tedious chore. Talking and having to respond at normal times. Having to laugh and act like the boring joke they said was funny. Even playing games got boring after fifteen minutes, and he’d just wish it’d end. He feels bad he really does, but he doesn’t care about Fred. At all. 

Even as Fred’s ice cream dropped onto the concrete leaving him bawling in public he hadn’t felt bad for him. Despite all the comforting words he gave to Fred, he couldn’t figure why he never truly cared. He bought him another one, and it was only met with the sickening words of how he was “Such a great friend!”. 

Was he a good friend? He knows he’s not a good person since he’s about to fill a random girl's house with frogs, but that’s beside the point. He does everything a good friend should do: help them, comfort them and be there for them when they need it. Even though he does everything correctly, he still doesn’t feel like a good friend. Like because he doesn’t feel any affection for Fred, it invalidates every action he does.

He knows he’s overthinking it, because his friend begins to catch onto his silence. He eases his friend’s worries with a joke off the top of his head that landed well enough to semi-brush the moment he spaced out under the rug.

Luckily it didn’t take long for him to be able to say goodbye to his friend so he was confident that Fred wouldn’t dwell on it. Most people didn’t care enough to ask and he wasn’t very surprised why.

Croak.

The maid began to quiver before saying, “Are you done yet! Those things back there have been only getting rowdier! I think they’re beginning to shake the vehicle!”

Clint couldn’t fathom why this one was always terribly frightened of everything. She must give herself a heart attack each morning staring at her own reflection.

Clint said, “Leave.”

She didn’t need to be told twice even if she managed to sputter out a few extra complaints. 

They made it to Elizabeth’s house in less than 15 minutes. It was 23 minutes away, but it seemed she wanted whatever was in the car out, including Clint. She had done some mild interrogating on how he got her address, but started to quiet down when he’d lied saying he got it from Flint. He swears that he got it in a very ethical way. 

He kicked out the car door open and lifted the trunk. There sat the 0.46 kilograms worth of common frogs he needed to ruin Flint’s ex-girlfriend’s life. They were all in a tank that was the height of himself, and nearly as wide as the trunk. At first he thought that they should get separate containers, but then thought that they only become lonely overtime.

He asked the servants to get him oddly specific things which unnerved them at first. The moment they found the frogs though they had some sort of change of heart. Although they still remained slightly petrified, they easily gave him what he asked for and even insisted on petting the frogs. He didn’t let them pet them because they were very fragile animals, and he didn’t want them to be frightened. 

He opened the lid and called Danny’s name. The frog had jumped into his hands without the slightest hesitation and began to croak for his attention. He couldn't help but pet the little guy. Danny looked very happy in his opinion.

“I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to leave you at your new home,” he said to the frog, “Don’t worry, she’s rich so you’re bound to be taken care of well.”

He doubted that but sacrifices must be made for the greater good. For a smaller blessing for Elizabeth he checked to make sure all the frogs were male, so they wouldn’t multiply in her house. He was hoping to frighten her, but not make her forced to call pest control. 

He had made sure to initiate such a plan when none of the Crofter’s were home so that way they’d get quite a shock to see Danny and Marky and Stephen and the rest. It was a gamble though, as he had no clue if an empty lot meant an empty house. There could be servants scanning the halls like security cameras. 

In terms of breaking and entering, the only difficulty getting into it was the locks on the doors and windows. They had no guards or vicious dogs like they do in the movies much to Clint’s dismay. 

The reason for this was very simple: The Crofter’s were good people. 

In the background check he made, the Crofter’s were some kindhearted souls that had started plenty of charities for the homeless and hungry. Clint at first assumed it was philanthropy until he learned they had some stereotypical American Dream life where they started with quite literally nothing. Since the charity work didn’t lean into any civil rights categories, they weren’t controversial figures that had to watch their backs. 

Overall, Clint had thought, “Fuck, I’m definitely the bad guy here…” and then looked at Danny as if he could somehow reassure him that wasn’t true. 

Clint had then tested a discreet window that led into a dusty-looking guest room. There was even a cobweb in the corner from the lack of maintenance done to it with nothing but a lonesome bed in it. The perfect place to be unspotted and wreak havoc. It was remarkably easy to pick the lock and head into the window. 

With Danny in tow, he found a sizable vent and began to crawl into it. He was hoping to find a solid place to drop off the frogs where they could be found. He didn’t want to just put twenty frogs in an unsearched room, because then his frogs were bound to end up dead due to neglect. 

It was like squeezing into those claustrophobic cave tunnels that looked to only be done by either people who don’t care about dying or liquid cats. Each turn made him contort into a shape so sharp that his legs were nearly close to breaking. With all the clanging he’s made when he accidentally pressed too hard on a metal panel he was half-convinced people already knew he was in there. 

He sighed in relief when he spotted the Crofter’s foyer. Spacious, empty and terribly lonely. The average rich person’s house if Clint was being honest. Clint had seen dozens of the same exact extravagant foyer at the party’s he had attended with Mother. For what he knew, no matter how filled the room was it always felt empty.

He carefully opened the vent and gently placed Danny on the ground. He had pet him one last time before telling Danny to be safe. He wanted to make a longer goodbye, but he had 19 more frogs to gently place down in this god forsaken home.

Open window. Slicing his spine to smithereens. Softly put the frog down. Rinse and repeat. 

He had done the process 19 times over the past half an hour and he was just about ready to call it quits. He was antsy, but they luckily don’t have servants in the house, at least whenever they leave the place. It was a bit strange for a family like the Crofter’s to worry about whether the people they hire would steal something, but Clint likes to count his blessings. 

With Jeromine being the last frog he had got out to admire his handiwork. A symphony of croaking was all around the foyer up a steep staircase to the second floor. It looked terribly grand with the white carpet they used, and Clint for a second had wondered if he’d go to heaven walking up it. 

Clint had taken a deep breath before shakily saying, “Everyone, I’m sorry to say but this is your new home. I’m going to miss you all and I hope you all create an absolute disaster here.”

He had sighed out and looked at the ground. He doesn’t know why he does it, but it usually brings him much more joy. Petty revenge does taste sweet, and if he has a petty excuse to do it then he’ll hop to it without hesitation. He never understood why he does it, but he always ends up feeling prideful. He got the last laugh, hurray.

Today he isn't feeling that way though. He gives out a somber sounding sigh as he slowly looks up at the frogs leaping up step after step of the heavensent staircase. 

Squelch.

Blood spills down on a blindingly white carpet. Slowly oozing down each staircase until it reaches his feet. The more he looks up, the more frog innards he finds sprawled out on the steps. His eyes meet a barefoot toe, and his eyes meet a girl with dead-fish eyes.

“How interesting, do you also cause problems to see how others react?” She descends the staircase with each step silently following the other, “We have the same eyes as well?”

Clint felt a feather-like touch creeping on his skin. It was searing onto him with the gentle caress of her fingers. She had appeared before his eyes as if she could flow with the wind. She could have been a trick of the eye or even the blow of a drafty window nearby. 

She suddenly frowned, “How annoying, I had thought you were just like me.”

She gripped his face and smoothed a finger around the eye that had tears falling out of it.

“You’re so similar, but you seem to be just slightly different from me.” 

“How could you talk so casually. You just killed. You just murdered.” 

He was too shocked to change his tone. He wanted to scream and berate her. He wanted to slap her or knock some humanity into her. He couldn’t think to do any such things, as he was frozen in a state of paralysis. 

She let go of his face and snatched Danny in a near death-grip. Danny struggles desperately, croaking for help in vain. He had swore to God that Danny had even said his name, but he may have guiltily imagined that up. Each time she had stroked Danny, the frog squirmed harder in her grasp. 

She said, “I know, but I couldn’t help it. No matter what I do I just can’t care. Don’t you feel that way? I see you in class at times, so I know you understand. That feeling like you’re so distant from everyone. The feeling like if you watched them get hurt in front of you wouldn’t care. You would act how you were supposed to in the situation, but festering deep down inside you is only the bitter annoyance of having to put on a face.”

She kept squeezing and squeezing as if she was trying to show a physical representation of her struggles. Clint didn’t know what to do as Danny was turning blue when he was supposed to be a pale green. 

“But finally! Finally someone understands me! I can see it in your eyes!” Danny had popped in her hands causing the frog’s innards to go to everyone in the nearest vicinity. 

Danny’s blood tastes slimy. 

Clint let out a guttural scream that came from witnessing something you most definitely shouldn’t see. Falling backwards and colliding with the ground he could not feel. He couldn’t stop; he was in front of a monster. A monster who had mistaken him for one as well. 

She sighed in distaste, “Don’t act shocked by what I said. It’s the dirty truth: you get me and you hate everyone.” 

“You killed Danny,” Clint had barely been able to gasp that out, “You killed Stephen, too. I’m not like you; don’t you ever get that twisted.” 

“Scram then, I’ll talk to you once you’ve regained a backbone. You certainly disappointed me, familiar.” 

With that she walked up the staircase, leaving behind red footsteps in her path. 

Clint had hurriedly ran out of the house and covered up his tracks. Carrying Marky back in a desperate attempt to keep at least one of his frogs alive. He covered up his tracks, and ran out of the mansion. Running as fast his little feet could take him to the car and slamming the door. He was panting like some rabid animal, he was covered in blood and leftover tears and his hands were shaking around Marky. 

The maid simply looked at him aghast and questioned, “Clint! What in God’s name happened!?”

He closed his eyes and shook his head. Tears only streamed down his face faster at the recollection of the massacre. He had assumed she’d be horrified but still at least rehome the frogs in a lake. She didn’t think she’d apathetically crush them with her bare feet. 

After a little while he had come to a solid conclusion of what happened, “I saw a monster…” 

Through the whole car ride he was sniffling back his tears. He doesn’t think he ever let his emotions out in front of someone like this. To be fair, he also had never witnessed death in front of his eyes so he thinks he gets a pass. The sound, the smell, the sight of it was already ingrained in his memory. Bile runs up his throat as he realizes he even knew the taste of it. 

He came home and immediately brought Mark to the frog enclosure in the vacant room he kept all of his frogs in. What once was so bursting in life only held lonesome Mark in the tank. A tank as tall as him and as wide as a coffee table but so empty. It was now just like any foyer. He could replace it with other frogs, but he knows he’ll still find it empty with the other 19 missing. 

He took a shower and tried to scrub himself clean. He drained the whole bottle of his soap and then his brother’s soap but it wouldn’t scrub clean. How could she say that he was like him? When she had felt Stephen’s warm blood on the soles of her feet she hadn’t bat an eye. 

Today, he had decided that he wasn’t the worst person in the world. He definitely wasn’t a monster like her no matter what she said! 

No matter the reassurances though he couldn’t wipe off the blood no matter how peeled his skin became. Couldn’t wipe off the feeling of its residue. Crouching down in a shower that slowly became cold he had realized it’d be useless. He felt stained. 

Coming out of the shower he still swore he smelt the blood on him, but decided it was a trick of his imagination. He put on another set of clothes and made it upstairs. Right as he was about to take a turn into his room a maid had snuck up behind him.

“Young master, I made you something to eat.”

He jumped a bit but was able to school it down to the point it wasn’t noticeable to a passerby. 

He turned around and frowned, “Mother told me I shouldn’t have so many treats and to turn you down on that offer when it’s not mealtime.” 

The maid had simply shook her head and pulled Clint into a hug, “Young Master, I have never seen you so shaken in my life, nor have I ever seen someone covered in blood like that. Please let me do this one thing for you.”

Clint couldn’t say no. 

The servants tended to not be as nervous whenever he ate at the dining table for some reason. It was a bit confusing, but he had assumed it was because he couldn’t really pull a foolish stunt with a spoon in his mouth.

The cooks decided to make his favorite food: chicken noodle soup. It was pretty strange for a kid to enjoy, but he found it warm and soothing. It eased that soreness in his throat from the earlier screaming. 

He hadn’t even realized that Flint was there until he poked him, “What did you do?”

Clint had dropped a noodle in the bowl and huffed out, “I hung out with Fred. Why do you always assume the worst—“

Before Clint could continue his hand was grasped by Flint. The skin was peeling off a bit, and Flint had given him a worried look.

“The truth.”

Flint was such a strange character. He got distracted by butterflies and cried over girls, yet would notice the slightest detail off on Clint’s hands. He was more often spacey, but whenever the teacher called on him he’d know the answer. Flint was just so sincere that Clint found it impossible not to crack under such walls and just spill out. 

“I had a nightmare, that’s all,” he said, which was the most Clint could say. 

Clint usually would spill the whole story, but how was Flint to believe such a tall tale filled with all 19 of his frogs ending up killed. Still Flint had pressed on.

“Well, what was it about?”

And Clint couldn’t shut up after that. It was unbelievable and looking back on it he felt kind of stupid for feeling such a way over a dumb thing. Still, it was nice whenever he voiced out his problems. It left his chest and made it feel less heavy. 

He had to tweak the narrative so it’d be believable. Made sure not to mention to Flint that it was in fact his ex. God forbid Flint learns he dated a freak! Flint would probably continue crying for the rest of the year hearing the actual story, because he’s a damn softie.

It was always quite hard to think of or even feel when he was bogged down by tight-knit feelings. Clustering up until he simply shut down and felt like he was running on autopilot. Now he could finally breathe again and it felt nice. It wasn’t like magically felt like the problem was resolved, but he felt better at least.

He finished up the soup by the time he finished up his story. Ending his rants like he always does.

“But I’m alright now, because I have you.”

Vanakkam!

As a North Indian, or “vadakkan” as many might refer to me, I write to you as someone who was born and raised here in this beautiful city. Chennai is more than a place I call home; it has shaped me, my values, and my identity in ways I never imagined. This letter is my heartfelt perspective and love for the city, its culture, and its people.

I grew up studying in a school where Tamilians and Marwaris dominated. I have to tell you, when times got tough, it was my Tamil friends who stood by me, loyal and unwavering. They were the ones who had my back when I needed it most. Loyalty is a value I have come to deeply respect, and I have seen it shine brightest in the Tamil community.

Tamil culture is not just something I observe from a distance; it is interwoven into my family’s life. From as far back as my memory takes me, we’ve always embraced Tamil traditions. We have “Tamil Saapad” meals as a family ritual, where the aroma of sambar and rasam feels like a warm hug. Weddings in my family are not complete without Tamil nights—where we dress up in South Indian attire and celebrate with delicious Tamil meals. With my cousins and close friends, who are also Marwaris, we find ourselves speaking in Tamil because sometimes, emotions carry an intensity that only Tamil can truly express.

My grandfather came to this city selling ghee, and through his hard work and dedication, he laid the foundation for our family here. Yes, some may stereotype us as “rich” or “privileged,” but the reality is, every family has its struggles, stories, and sacrifices. The divide between the North and South is an idea I have come to believe is fueled by politics and ignorance. As a generation, we must rise above this divisive agenda. At our core, we are all humans with the same desires for love, growth, and happiness.

To my Tamil brothers and sisters, I want to say this: You have enriched my life in ways I cannot put into words. Your culture, your language, your sense of community, and your loyalty are values I hold dear to my heart. I know some people look at differences with prejudice, but I want to see beyond these labels. This world doesn’t need more division; it needs understanding and unity.

Whenever I travel away from Chennai, there is a void that no other city can fill. The warmth of the people, the smell of filter coffee, the sound of the waves at Marina, the celebration of Pongal, and even the soothing chaos of the city traffic—I miss it all. Chennai is not just the best city in India; for me, it is a part of my soul.

I embrace Tamil culture with love and gratitude. I urge all of us, especially the youth, to see beyond our regional, linguistic, or cultural differences. We have the power to create a future that unites rather than divides. Let’s rise above the stereotypes and work toward a world where humanity comes first.

With love,
A Vadakkan who will always love Chennai and its people",26,1737604500.0,Chennai,5,0.96,False

I wrote this the night after I finally grew a pair and left my (now, Ex) wife.  I had a work friend who happened to be georgeous and young, but she was never more than a work friend.  This was about 20 years ago and I have nothing to hide.  We were never intimate beyond this one night where she provided a safe haven, and even that night, she just comforted me.  There was no sex, that night or any other.  She listened to me... held me when I needed to cry and be held.  She let me hold her, under the glow of her candle of cinnamon apple on the coffee table.  It was the worst night of my life, but she was a true friend and helped me (literally) to see the dawn of what could be.  I drove away from her house as the sun was rising, we hugged, and I will forever be grateful to her for the care and comfort she selflessly provided.

It is said God sends an angel
to any soul in need.

Now I am a believer,
He sent one to me.

The golden glow of apples and cinnamon 
kissed her tender skin,

If I've ever beheld such beauty,
I cannot remember when.

And as she lay, clad in soft cotton white,
her beauty and tranquil grace,

For a moment, all too brief
Granted passage to a better place.

When it's golden medley sang to me,
I ran fingers through her hair.

Then her flesh, it beckoned me,
I caressed as much I dared...

Under her warm and gentle gaze,
My tortured soul was put to rest.

And if she give me nothing more,
I'll take away nothing less.

The peace that she did give to me,
Forever mine to keep.

That was the gift she gave to me,
When I watched an Angel sleep.

1i7ul7t,https://i.redd.it/5wlq9p0k0oee1.png,New to wood stoves: my experience so far. Is Olive Wood the holy grail.,"Moved into a temporary place with a wood stove in the south of England.  That's Olde England, not the new fangled one in the USA.


Seasoned wood:
As winter drew in we started using the seasoned wood that had been left behind by the previous residents, and a builders bag full that we ordered. Decent, or at least it was decent after I figured that the rope seal needed replacing which I was able to do as I had some spare from the BBQ/smoker I sealed previously.  The thermometer we bought that attached to the metal flue (next to an oven fan) just about got into the ideal temperature range.  The room temperature was raised after a while (a couple of hours) to a comfortable 22c (71.6f).


Kiln dried:
Having exhausted the seasoned wood we bought 1m3 of kiln dried wood.  Not sure of the quality because whilst it burns well insofar as it catches well, the temperature is no better and it seems to burn through quicker.  Still have more than half to get through.

Various pellets of coffee grounds and whatnot from a supermarket:
Hmmm, they did for us in a pinch while we waited for the kiln dried stuff to arrive but we're frankly disappointing.  They crumble and fall through the grate, burn up quickly and no improvement to the heat.

Olive wood:
Is this the holy grail of wood stove firewood?
We bought a bag out of curiosity when at the supermarket this evening.  £15 for a bag (18litres).
Threw 3 thin logs onto the embers of the previous fire.
Wow!!  The temperature went into the middle of the ideal temperature range, room temperature went up to 26c (78.8f) and we had to open the door to cool the room and share the heat with the rest of the house.
The 3 modest logs lasted for a good 2 hours and we still giving out heat when we went to bed.
It's expensive but if it's as energy dense as it initially appears it might be worth it.


Anyway, enjoy your stoves.

Looking to transform your living space into the perfect blend of warmth and style? [Modern rustic living rooms](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/modern-rustic-living-room-ideas/) are the ultimate design trend, combining the charm of natural elements with sleek, contemporary vibes. 

Imagine weathered wood beams paired with minimalist furniture, soft neutral tones enhanced by bold accents, and cozy textures that invite you to unwind.

To nail the look, start with a neutral palette—think shades of white, beige, and gray. Layer in rustic elements like reclaimed wood coffee tables, exposed brick walls, or leather armchairs. Add a modern twist with clean-lined sofas, geometric light fixtures, and metallic accents. 

Don’t forget to play with texture! Incorporate chunky knit throws, jute rugs, and woven baskets to create a cozy yet chic atmosphere.

One standout feature in modern rustic design is natural lighting. Maximize it with large windows or floor-to-ceiling glass panels. And for an extra touch of elegance, add greenery—potted plants or fresh flowers can breathe life into the space.

Winter Storm Enzo brought a rare and magical snowfall to Savannah this week, and we couldn’t pass up the chance to explore the city like we’ve never seen it before. Savannah was blanketed with up to 3 inches of snow, turning our coastal city into a true winter wonderland!

We started our snowy adventure at **Coffee Bluff Marina**, where the frosted docks and peaceful views were like something out of a painting. Then, we headed to **Forsyth Park**, where the fountain looked like it belonged in a snow globe. Families were having snowball fights, building snowmen, and capturing the magic of a Savannah snow day.

But the *real* fun began when we picked up Ruby, my daughter, and saw a group of people sledding down the side of the **Truman Parkway on-ramp**. Savannah might not have hills, but in true Southern fashion, we got creative! With the lid of a plastic storage box in hand, we joined in—and let’s just say, it was the most fun we’ve had in a long time.

Snow is such a rare sight in Savannah, and this day reminded us to embrace the unexpected and enjoy life’s simple joys.

We even captured the whole adventure on video! If you want to see Savannah in the snow, check it out here: \[Insert YouTube Link\]

Personally, I feel I pass pretty well? I have a deep enough voice, a full beard, broad shoulders and a flat chest. Only things that clock me are my thighs (I hide them) and height (I'm 5'2, can't do anything about that). Plus, I guess I act kinda feminine? I'm not really afraid of that, and don't really want to act blunt just to pass as more masc ykno. 

Before I had top surgery, I told a select few people at my work, people I felt I could trust with it. One of these people is a cisgendered girl a few years younger than me. She buys me boba, is very cuddly, and is nice to me, seemingly a sweet person. 

When I initially came out to her, she was polite with asking questions, and mostly just seemed a bit worried about me having surgery (Fair).. But on one of my last days, she gave me this look, and ik I'm autistic but I swear my brain clocked it as.. Pity? 

Post surgery, I noticed her language started to change. She stopped trying to correct herself when deadnaming and misgendering me. I figured, no big deal, she knows I'm a guy, and I felt too awkward to correct her. (Because, like.. I'm obviously not a woman lmao, it's odd to refer to me as such)? 

Well, today I came into work early (Bought myself and her coffee before work as a nice treat), work goes by, store closes. A few of us are chatting in a group, and she misgendered me infront of another coworker (who is her boyfriend) that I have history with (He was interested in me before her but I'm not about dating coworkers or questionably ""Straight"" men lol). 

He corrects her repeatedly, and they then start to argue over my gender with me standing right there. Him going, ""No, he's a he. His name is Blank"" and her kinda laughing uncomfortably.. I can feel where the conversation is going, and at this point in the night I'm too tired to form a cohesive thought, so I just say to her.. ""Please don't say what you're about to say"" honestly silently begging her not to, but to my dismay, she motions to me and goes.. 

""Cmon, I mean, just look at her"". 

When I tell you that shit stung, like.. 🥹 I felt that in the pit of my stomach. I just feel so.. Disappointed and defeated by this. I'm comfortable in my body, and feel I pass well, but hearing this remark from someone I considered a friend and a safe space at my work (We've hung out outside of work, I went to her birthday party FFS).. It just felt so bad?? 

I wanna say, I'm not reporting her. I get the vibe she's simply ignorant to the offensiveness of what she said, and I just.. don't have the heart to be mad at her for it.. I'm just sad. 

Maybe I can try to talk to her about how she hurt my feelings in the future, but I really don't know how to go about that. 

I wanted to vent a little, and ask if anyone had any trans positivity to cheer me up in the comments. I really need it right now, thanks guys. 💔🏳️‍⚧️

bear with me now. i met my new apartment roommate and she’s really cool and nice, we’ve become fast friends. turns out she knows him and is in the same jewish student organization as him. she sees him every friday. she was delighted to find out i know him and she’s offered to have me come with her to their welcome dinner this friday, which seems fun. she’s already been taking me up to the other members. i just don’t want to be weird or over impose as i’m not religious. this guy is very kind and open minded and has no hangups or prejudices towards me, it’s one of the many things i really like about him. like he’s husband material. but i don’t want to lose him as a friend and i don’t want to overstep. he said he wanted to hang out with me and our mutual friend sometime soon so i could always just do that. let me know what you guys think and hopefully this was coherent lol.

Grandmother's 100th birthday! Menu commentary and fish advice would be appreciated.","I've posted this in ask culinary as well, but looking for as much insight as possible!

Hello cooks! I'm the most cooking obsessed and experienced in my family; I'm not trained, but consider myself a good home cook (started cooking with my granny as a kid).

My granny's 100th birthday is in March, and I'm handling the sit down fancy dinner (she will also have a garden tea party for a larger friend's and community reception, but I'm not the baker type, so thankfully off the hook for that one! )

Most of my immediate family is vegetarian or vegan (grandmother included) and prefer not to have meat heavy dishes cooked in the house (we are hosting at my mom's house). My vegetarian menu plan is a follows: 

Amuse buche - Pani Puri with not traditional fillings, leaning towards a Mediterranean flavour profile

Soup course - roasted red pepper or creamy mushroom (my mushroom soup is a family favourite

Palate cleanser - lemon sorbet 

Mains - a butternut squash ""wellington"", pre cooked butternut neck, halved, mushroom and herb ""duxelles"", puff pastry, served with roasted baby carrots and maybe Brussel sprouts, soft very buttery mashed potato and long stemmed broccoli (pan fried, garlic)

Salad course - a romaine single leaf salad, cruton, feta tomato, rocket, cucumber 

Dessert - not yet decided, but probably a molded individual dessert with a firm outside and mousse type filling. 

Cheese selection and coffee/sherry/tea

I've kind of settled on this, because my granny is 100, likes this type of food and can't chew hard food well. I'll include an array of sauces to go with the ""wellington"". 


Now when it comes to the more extended part of my family, they are voracious south African meat eaters lol. I'm hoping to placate them with fish in a compromise.

So I'm considering the same menu, just changing the amuse bouche (filling of smoked salmon, chopped romaine, cream cheese, dill, capers). 

The only other course I will change is the main  course, and here's my worry: I have a great recipe for a baked white fish with a mustard mayo sauce, a little cheese, buttered bread crums and herbs. However, as I'm leaning towards fancier, I was also considering a teriyaki king clip or garlic butter yellow tail (both affordable fishes in SA, but a bit fancier than hake or cod). My concern is that I'd prefer not to need to make two different sets of sides for the fish, and the teriyaki kingklip fails me there. I've also not cooked a lot of fish in my life.

The diners will mostly be old. I was considering haddock with a mornay sauce, but I know that it can be overpowering. I doubt the attendees will go for unfamiliar or Asian favours, and I don't have the budget to go real fancy with sole or salmon (v expensive in SA) or anything. 

Baked is a plus, as I want the only active cooking right before serving to be the broccoli and assemblage of amuse bouche. 

My veggie wellingtons can be made the day before, so quite settled on that. 

Any commentary, advice (especially in the fishy vein!) greatly appreciated. I myself don't like fish unless it doesn't taste fishy at all, and apart from that I'm quite an adventurous eater, having travelled a lot and now living in VN for 6 years. 

I fly home to SA a week early, so I have a few days to recipe test before I need to start preparing for the meal, for which more and more guests keep popping up. 

Thank you if you got this far! Comments on my menu plan are also greatly appreciated. We really want this to be a special meal, as we feel a hundredth birthday party is more special than even a wedding! ",3,1737603172.0,Cooking,1,1.0,False

1i7ubhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1i7ubhw/what_role_does_storytelling_play_in_facebook/,What role does storytelling play in Facebook marketing campaigns?,"**Storytelling** plays a critical role in **Facebook marketing campaigns** by helping brands connect emotionally with their audience, build trust, and create memorable experiences. In a platform where users are often overwhelmed by content, stories stand out, engage people, and drive action. Here's how storytelling enhances Facebook marketing campaigns:

# 1. Emotional Engagement

* **Impact**: Stories trigger emotions, which make the content more relatable and memorable. Emotional engagement is known to drive consumer behavior and brand loyalty.
* **Example**: A charity might share a heartfelt story about how donations directly helped a family in need, tapping into the emotions of compassion and urgency.

# 2. Building Brand Identity

* **Impact**: Storytelling allows a brand to define its voice, values, and personality. Through consistent storytelling, brands can craft a narrative that resonates with their target audience.
* **Example**: Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign emphasizes stories of perseverance and athletic achievement, which aligns with their brand's core message of empowerment.

# 3. Creating Relatability

* **Impact**: Stories help consumers see themselves in the brand’s message. By sharing authentic, relatable experiences, brands can connect with their audience on a personal level.
* **Example**: A coffee shop could share a behind-the-scenes story about a local farmer whose beans are used in their blends, fostering a deeper connection with the community.

# 4. Simplifying Complex Messages

* **Impact**: Storytelling makes complex or technical products easier to understand. By presenting the benefits of a product or service in a narrative, it becomes more digestible and compelling.
* **Example**: A tech company might tell the story of a customer who used their software to solve a specific problem, highlighting its key features in an engaging way.

# 5. Encouraging Action

* **Impact**: Stories can be powerful motivators for action. They often lead to calls-to-action (CTAs) that encourage users to take the next step—whether it's making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or donating.
* **Example**: A brand could tell a story about how using their product improved a customer’s life, followed by a CTA like “Get started today and transform your routine!”

# 6. Fostering Community and Engagement

* **Impact**: Storytelling often invites audience interaction. Whether it's sharing their own stories in the comments, engaging with polls, or participating in contests, it creates an active community around the brand.
* **Example**: A fitness brand might post a story about someone’s fitness journey and invite followers to share their own transformation stories in the comments, building a sense of belonging.

# 7. Increased Shareability

* **Impact**: Compelling stories are more likely to be shared by users, which helps extend the brand’s reach organically. People love sharing stories that resonate with them, especially if they evoke strong emotions.
* **Example**: An animal rescue organization shares a story about an animal’s journey from shelter to adoption, encouraging followers to share it with their own networks to spread awareness.

# 8. Building Trust and Authenticity

* **Impact**: Authentic stories about a brand’s origins, values, or social impact can foster trust. Transparency and authenticity in storytelling are key in the age of informed consumers.
* **Example**: A brand that produces sustainable clothing could share stories about their eco-friendly production process, showing commitment to their values.

# Best Practices for Storytelling in Facebook Marketing Campaigns

* **Use Visuals**: Complement your story with high-quality images, videos, and infographics to enhance engagement and make your story more compelling.
* **Keep it Authentic**: Authenticity is key. Ensure the story aligns with the brand’s values and resonates with the target audience.
* **Focus on the Audience**: Rather than just promoting your product, focus on how it benefits or impacts the customer’s life.
* **Utilize Facebook Features**: Use Facebook’s story format, live videos, and polls to interact with the audience in real-time.
* **Be Consistent**: Build a cohesive narrative across all your campaigns, creating continuity that strengthens the overall brand message.

# Key Takeaway

Storytelling on Facebook helps brands humanize themselves, connect emotionally with users, and stand out in a crowded marketplace. By crafting engaging, authentic, and relatable stories, brands can foster deeper relationships with their audience, increase engagement, and drive meaningful actions.",1,1737603040.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

Now (since I live with my parents) my mom has been talking to a therapist and wants me to go out with her, she finds it cool that her sessions are out drinking coffee or something like that, but none of that interests me, there is nothing that I would want to fix or something that is wrong to begin with. Let's say I have understood that this is as good as I can get, the other therapist said maybe travelling or meeting different people would be good to see if I would want to form connections. 

Something else is that my mom is very insistent on me getting to know girls my age and talk to them, but I rarely leave my house or have any hobbies that are a topic of conversation, I prefer to keep everything I do to myself, I don't see how talking to anyone is gratifying or beneficial to me. I don't even mask or anything, but I do keep my politeness when I see this is supposed to be a friendly encounter, but nothing ever sticks; it's like all the potential relationships try to hold on to nothing, and that's because of me not ever engaging, and it has happened before. If I wanted to, I would. I have a few onine friends with which I do enjoy talking to and I have even showed my face and all and I have been honest, yet currently I am on a break from any social media, so instead I am just investigating about things that call my attention.

I wouldn't know what others really want from me, there is only so much I can do, but it all feels like a task and nothing is really enjoyable, just like every superficial talk.

1i7u6rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1i7u6rx/valiant_lady_indepth_review_first_time_cruisers/,Valiant Lady in-depth review (first time cruisers),"**Overall:** We are a couple in our early 20s that decided to take a cruise in the middle of January on the Valiant Lady with *way* too much time before our flight home. Both of us had no prior cruising experience. This was the 5-night Dominican Daze cruise with a stop at Puerto Plata and Bimini. Our Puerto Plata stop was swapped out with Grand Turk.

**Embarkation/Debarkation:** From the Miami airport, took public transit (metrorail and metromover) to and from the port in an effort to save drink money lol (and experience a bit of Miami with the few hours we had). We want to highlight this as an option since it’s something we haven’t seen on most cruise blogs/posts. Transit was excellent to and through downtown Miami, but the port tram/trolley was inconsistent and confusing as not all trolleys that stop at the posted stop go to the signed destination and headways were between 20-45 minutes. We would 100% recommend this, though if you pack light and have the time since it only cost $4.50 for one way for two. 

* Also to note, you CAN also walk between downtown Miami and the port but, as many on the subreddit have pointed out, it is a way that can be made difficult by weather and lack of pedestrianized walkways once you hit the port island. On the Virgin side, everything was so smooth. Arrived at our timeslot of 2:30pm and made it on and to our room within 15 minutes so really nothing to comment on! Debarkation was also very smooth, and we made it off within 15 minutes.

**Room:** We had a Central Sea Terrace on the 8th deck and loved it! The bed was firm but comfortable, loved the hammock and shower, and our balcony looked out primarily over a seating area near the Pizza Place (We were very happy we weren’t fully over the water!). With an open balcony door, you could hear some ocean/ship and people noise, but surprisingly no noise when the door was closed. We didn’t have issues with noise in the room. Only noise was from performers in the Roundabout area as the level 7 open area was nearly directly below our room. The noise stopped at \~midnight depending on the day. If you need complete silence/sleep earlier in the night this could be an issue for you.

**Dining:** We ate at all major restaurants for dinner except for Razzle Dazzle. We booked our cruise late (about a month prior) so had later dining times (8:15-8:30pm) but was not an issue. We didn’t research the dining before and wanted to go in blind, so ordered more food than we should have at Extra Virgin and the Wake because we had heard we should try a little of everything.

*Extra Virgin* 

* Food was amazing, to us it was practically elevated Italian food, with a bit more of an emphasis on seafood pastas. 
* We ate way too much, charcuterie-esque board was not for us. The bread, appetizers, and pastas were amazing, and we ended up trying three different pastas. Steak was fine, Sea Bass was good. Did not get dessert.

 *Gunbae*

*  We loved Gunbae, it’s interactive and you are seated with other couples. We were seated with three older couples who were very nice. We played the drinking game and our server (forgot his name :( ) was amazing at getting everyone involved even though the older couples were very hesitant. 
* Server checked with us and chose what he thought we’d all like and he was spot on! The banchan, bibimbap, seafood pancake was our favorites, and the meat was delicious. 

*Pink Agave* 

* Pink agave was our favorite restaurant of our cruise. Most flavorful and least heavy foods with awesome courses. We got the sip and savor here and it was perfect (especially for scarlet night).
* Got a variety of appetizers and medium plates that were tasty, Sea bass was amazing, steak was really good. Desserts were light and not overly sweet. 

*Test Kitchen* 

* We had Menu C and really liked Test Kitchen. Our server Sol was amazing, and explained and checked in with us after every dish. She even took it in stride when two people got up and left mid-meal as well. We got the Sip and Savor here as well and it paired perfectly. 
* We were a bit nervous about the food looking at other reviews, but liked all of the courses and they were truly very well crafted. Subbing out menu items for those on the alternate menu was easy for allergies or likes/dislikes but specify when you originally order to keep the experience seamless. 

*The Wake* 

* We enjoyed The Wake, but it wasn’t our favorite. Again, we paced ourselves poorly, but the food we got wasn’t incredibly impressive which is likely because it’s the most “traditional” of the offerings. We did purchase a half dozen of the oysters and these were amazing. 
* Bread and appetizers were yummy (the clam chowder and bone marrow dish), the steak was pretty good and the Dorade was alright but a little tasteless for me. We ordered some sides that were tasty, but were too full and did not order dessert. 

*Razzle Dazzle* 

* While we didn’t eat dinner here, we did eat brunch. It was good food but wasn’t exactly our style which is also partially why we chose brunch. The waffle was very sweet to us, the Sunnyside hash was toned down in a way that made it good for breakfast. Bakery items were moist and good. 
* We ended up preferring the options in the Galley for breakfast, but this could also be because of more options/not wanting to commit to a set eating time for brunch. 

*Galley/Other* 

* We ate here for breakfast/lunch or grabbing snacks. Galley had good food options, we especially liked the Bento box place, the taco place for breakfast, and the ramen place. All pretty good especially on a ship! 
* We tried the Dock House, Social Club, and Coffee shop- these were all alright, but nothing impressive.
* Special shoutout to the poke bowl place- we tried this on the first day and it was fire

**Entertainment/Activities**

To preface, because of our activity prioritization and dining reservations, we didn’t end up going to many of Virgin’s shows, only making it to a few - Dual Reality, UNTITLEDDANCEPARTYTHING, Bingo with the Diva, and Last One Standing. For most of the shows, while we REALLY appreciate the artistry that went into both with the most talented groups of dancers and complex choreography, they fell a bit short in our opinion. For Dual Reality, it was honestly just too short and didn’t flesh out its concept as well as it could’ve.

For UNTITLEDDANCEPARTYTHING, a LOT of the references fell very flat for us, leaning into more “millennial”-esque humor (think “randomness”, cats, and even a Titanic recorder joke bit straight out of 2012). That’s not to say the show was bad (especially in the second half) as the audience seemed to enjoy it (as did we) because the performers are just energetic and execute well.

We also love trivia, but it was disheartening that the two rounds we played of Celebrity Trivia did not have any references more recent than 2011 (even then, that 2011 celebrity was the Beastie Boys for their final album).

Some of the events that we felt were a lot livelier and more fit to what we expected were Bingo with the Diva, Last One Standing, and the Heartbeat Club Night. 

* Bingo did have an upfront cost, but the jokes did line up with the ‘crude’-ness we had originally expected and the happenings cast made it an enjoyable event. 
* Last One Standing was trivia that was definitely more inclusive, and while it being knock-out trivia made it slightly less participatory, we had a good time. 
* Heartbeat club night was by far the best (for us) music we heard during the entire cruise and fit that EDM vibe we were expecting, with songs that we enjoy and recognized! Even though there were few people there, we had a blast. 
* Scarlet Night’s pool party- this did have music that was a little more varying and enjoyable for us, but the afterparty was disappointing in comparison.

Overall, in regard to the entertainment on board; for a cruise line that we thought targeted a younger audience (20s-30s), we felt most entertainment was targeted towards those 30-35+. One thing we were excited about initially was the club offering on board, the Manor, which we expected to play typical club music (EDM, pop, etc.). We were honestly surprised when we attended the first afterparty of our sailing and the soundtrack consisted of Milli Vanilli, Snoop Dogg, and “Karma Chameleon,” with that era of music being played predominantly for the first three nights. We tried our best to have fun since a cruise is what you make of it, but we often felt like we were not recognizing or familiar with many/most entertainment/references when we thought we were supposed to be more of the target demographic.

**Bars**

*On the Rocks*\- our favorite bar- had live entertainment every night and good drinks! The bartenders made very well-crafted drinks with the exception of one fluke Manhattan. This space did get loud and busy but expected for a large common space in the middle of the ship.

*Casino Bar*\- personable bartenders and we liked the small space and proximity to the Manor, Red Room, and casino without being very crowded. Drinks were good.

*Manor Bar*\- Usually very crowded, and drink selection was pretty weak. Especially with loud entertainment nearby, it got the job done.

*The Loose Cannon*\- We liked the drink we got (with a buzz button iykyk), but it was pretty sugary and other drink options looked pretty sweet as well.

**Ports** 

*Grand Turk* \- Loved the clear blue waters and spent all day sat by the beach (can’t say one of us didn’t come out burnt 😭) but was worth it for some of the best swimming you’ll do in the Caribbean.

*Bimini* \- A very surprising love for us, as well. The beach club had a fun atmosphere, with a near constant pool party throughout the day that wasn’t overbearing/overstimulating. The music here was enjoyable, the pool wasn’t overcrowded, and the floaties were fun. We opted to go in the beach area too and while cold, the water was nice. The shuttle to/from the beach club was easy and very consistent. The food was also pretty good, and we liked that it differed from other food on the ship.

**Service**

While our linens didn’t get changed every day (and we didn’t need that), our bed got made (with blanket art reminiscent to more traditional cruising) and water refilled with new glasses after pressing the blue cleaning light before we left for the day. Our cabin attendant, Mohammad Ali, was awesome!

All of the servers, managers, and other crew were extremely helpful throughout the entire cruise, and even when we just simply looked lost in the Galley, they were helpful in letting us know options, and where to go. I don’t think we had a bad interaction with any of them or really anybody while on the cruise.

**Casino** 

Casino was a bit small, but since we aren't heavy gamblers, it was good enough to play some slots and blackjack. The dealers we had were also generally friendly! 

* We did want to try the Smoking Room as we thought it would be more like a cigar lounge (did not do our research here) but it ended up feeling more like a depressing afterthought of an area off behind the cash out area of the casino. This was not very clear on the app and, even though it didn’t detract as the smoking area on Deck 16 is good, it was a slight disappointment.

**Other** 

* Bar tab- we purchased a total of $600 in bar tab and got an extra $100 because of a Bar Tab deal. we were concerned about how much bar tab we had, but with one heavier night and the drink pairings we finished it out perfectly. 
* We didn’t understand the difference between bar tab and sailor loot when we got on board- things like bingo cards and special foods at places like the wake ARE at an extra charge. Oops. 
* Wifi was okay as expected, slow but usable. 
* Drinking water availability around the ship was a little sparse- We could’ve called and asked for refills in our carafes, but it was strange to not see any water stations closer to us than the 15th floor. At bars, however, they had plenty of water available. 
* Of course the happenings cast was amazing, and they do their jobs with such grace and enthusiasm. It’s so hard to do what they do well, and they surpass that. Shout out to them especially for making this cruise a blast no matter what! <3

Overall, we really enjoyed this cruise, loved the spaces and the food options that they provided on this ship. Especially comparing this cruise to other lines we’ve researched, this cruise was one of the best values we found. We were a little disappointed in the mismatch in age demographics compared to what we had expected, and felt like many of the shows and entertainment were more geared towards the older demographic. We would’ve loved to see some more activities/entertainment that is geared towards the younger people we thought they were targeting. Despite the port change, we had a great time with no scheduled excursions and did our best to enjoy every second of it all even if we wouldn’t consider ourselves ‘beach people’ typically. 

We’ll definitely be back on another sailing soon, but if anybody has any tips/feedback/suggestions please let us know so we can make the most of our next trip!",16,1737602624.0,VirginVoyages,5,1.0,False

I hate that I’m even here asking for advice on this.,"I met a guy recently at my work & it seemed like we really hit it off. I work in a family practice doctor’s office as a receptionist and he’s a sales rep that one of our docs reached out to. He’s been in the office 3 times and each time it’s seemed like he’s been flirting with me. (I’m not exactly the best judge when it comes to this type of thing though & I was flirting back but again, not great at that either lol). He gave me his number the first visit to send a coffee order for the meeting he scheduled with the doctors, which isn’t unusual for sales reps. So he does have my number, but there’s been no communication outside of the office. Am I reading too much into it? Is it more likely he was just being a good salesman? I can’t stop thinking about him, which is extremely annoying, but I don’t want to make the first move in case he’s not interested and then have it be super awkward any time he comes into the office. It’s been like 8 years since I’ve dated anyone so I’m very out of my element here. ",1,1737602603.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I (29f) lost my dad in 2017 very suddenly. He did not have a will (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FREAKING WILL PEOPLE). My mom and her lawyer had signed the family home into my name without my knowledge, because my mom owes the government $300k in taxes for the business she and my dad had together. She was afraid the government was going to seize the house. My parents had taken out a mortgage back in 2012 by using the family home as collateral. My mom is now filing for bankruptcy, and the mortgage is part of it.

My mother is the kind of person who expects everyone to save her. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to realize the real person that she is. All she cares about now is smoking weed/cigarettes in the garage with her boyfriend (who is my cousin by the way.. My father’s sister’s son) and drinking coffee.

Here is where things get crazy complicated. My mom attempted to coerce me into taking out a $100,000 loan to pay off her mortgage and property tax arrears. She would then pay the loan off and figure out how much money I would owe HER. At first I was convinced to do it. After multiple arguments with my husband (33m), I called it off. My mom was PISSED. Accused me of fucking her over and ruining everything.

My adopted brother then offers to buy the family home. He wanted to make monthly payments and only give me $25k on a $500k plus home. I said no, and he retracted his offer after I told him I wanted at least $100k. The stress, agony and bullshit that my family has put me through these last 12 years was worth way more than $25k. My family started threatening me, calling me a thief and a coward, calling my husband a greedy bastard and told me I should relocate my family and that I deserve nothing. I’ve been harassed at work, and have almost had to call the police.

After consulting multiple lawyers, my mother has no legal ground to stand on. I am the legal owner of the property. We don’t have any sort of lease/rental agreement, so I can evict her whenever I want, and can put the house on the market whenever I want. Once it sells, all I have to do is make sure that the mortgage and property taxes are paid off, which I had intentions of paying anyways. I have gone no contact with my entire family. I have blocked them on all social media platforms, and I don’t respond to any phone calls or text messages from them.

My husband and I are in the process of getting our own house insurance on the property. We are then writing the eviction notice, and kicking them out. If they don’t go peacefully, we are making a court date to get the police involved to get them out. Then we will put the house on the market and we will keep every cent from the sale. We will pay off our debts, buy our own home, and put the rest into investments for our children’s future. Whatever happens to my mother, is her own problem now.

He's my advocate at  medical appointments, listening, taking notes and asking the questions I""m too afraid to get the answers to. He surprises me by beating me to the laundry, or bringing me an iced tea while I'm gardening on a hot summer day. He knows how every single appliance in our house works, and is unafraid to use them.

He's great at the romantic gestures as well. He'll take us sleigh riding on full moon nights after the all the kiddies are home and the slope is deserted.

1i7tsnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/comments/1i7tsnd/michaels_world/,Michael’s World,"The lights flicker, unwilling to die out even if it's been like that for months. Three, then two, then three again. It is almost like Morse code. Wonder if anyone else notices it. Life here is monotonous and soul-sucking, yet I still return.

It's been like this ever since, so much so that I've despised myself as to why I am here. At least the routine helps. Keeps me grounded, or else I won't know what to do with myself.

At times, I thought about quitting, but recently, I was given no choice due to problems appearing out of nowhere. 

Problems that spiraled out of my control.

I have seemingly involved myself in a mess that was not even my fault in the first place, involving my wife, Sarah, and her lover, Thomas…

Even now, I sometimes catch whispers, even at work. I used to be bitter at those comments but let them be over time. Though I keep little notes every now and then.

Now, I'm just going with the flow, continuing to work. The money helps maintain some semblance of normalcy—or at least as normal as things can get.

I have bills to pay and an adopted pet to feed. Funny how this has become my life now. I never saw myself as a pet owner—never even wanted one. But somehow, it all worked out.

The clock ticks down to its final moments, and my work for the day is done; it's time to head home.

I checked my watch - 5:30 PM, right on time. Exiting the old office building, I walked down the cracked sidewalks of the main road. 

Cars passed by, noisy as ever. A few minutes later, I reached the street, entering a small community neighborhood, a brief escape from the city's noise. My house is just a tiny distance down.

As the noise faded, I breathed a sigh of relief, my mind wandering as usual. Lately, my life has revolved around just two things: work and Tom. I named him after my favorite cartoon as a kid. 

He's been on my mind more than usual. My notepad fills with notes during meetings - feeding schedules, exercise routines, and strategies to make his transition easier.

This reminds me that Tom gets anxious if dinner's late, and I hate seeing him distressed. The sounds he made when that happened startled me the first time. He used to be a bit loud, but with a few quick adjustments here and there, he's much calmer now—better than ever. 

These days, I can't help but wonder what my life would be like without Tom. Probably far away from all this. But now, I have someone to care for, which changes everything.

I pause, taking in the familiar scene as more residential buildings become visible. The walk is short but revealing. Neighbors wave from their afternoon routines, their smiles never quite reaching their eyes.

Mrs. Johnson's wave seems shakier these days. Mr. Peterson barely looks my way anymore. They must know something's changed, but they don't understand. They can't.

Passing by, a flash of familiar features caught my eye - A face smiling from a poster. Fresh ink and all. A bitter sound came out of me, a slight chuckle.

Someone's been busy putting up new ones. Probably Thomas's wife. I don't know why she desperately looks for the man who left her. That smile in the photo - the same one Thomas wore that day. Even now, even after everything.

I suppress a smile, crumpling the paper and throwing it to the side before continuing. I vividly remember the day I found Sarah and Thomas together.

The sounds they made were... less than human. Fitting, really, considering how things turned out.

Neighbors watched as I did that, but none told me off. Rumors of what happened probably fueled their reactions. In a small community like this, information tends to spread faster.

They sometimes look at me with pity as I walk by, but the disappointment in their eyes says everything about my choices.

Upon arriving, the key turns in the lock, and I hear the familiar shuffle inside—then silence. 'I'm home,' I call out softly. As usual, there's no response. I've grown used to that. 

My footsteps echo against the bare walls as I step inside. In the corner sits one of Tom's makeshift sleeping areas, spaces I modified for his… unique circumstances.

He's still adjusting, I tell myself.

He was a gift from Bob, barely a week after all the drama. A good companion, he says.

At first, I resisted, but he was persistent. He said I deserved it after everything I'd been through, his words carrying a hint of expectation, almost as if I should feel grateful. It took time to accept what he was saying, but something shifted inside me when I looked into its eyes. Eventually, I brought him home.

'Hey, bud,' I whisper, gently patting his head. He trembles slightly, his wide eyes reflecting what some might mistake for fear.

Bob assured me it was normal—that it would pass with time. Tom was a rescue, after all, and this was just part of the rehabilitation process.

It was my first time owning a pet, and the whole thing felt strange. But I know, with time, I can learn to be a better owner for him too.

Besides, Bob gave me some kind of guidebook for this. Though most information written is useless at this stage.

Bob was strange. He collected people's stories like others collected stamps—with an enthusiasm that bordered on obsession. We met not long after Sarah left, though the circumstances were anything but ordinary.

The first contact came through Sarah's phone. A text, then a call. He claimed he'd bought it from her—said she sold it as partial payment for his ""services."" The way he lingered on that last word made my skin crawl. Then he dropped the real bombshell: Sarah owed him, and since my number was the only one still saved on her phone, he figured I might cover the rest.

Her debts. Her lies. My responsibility. I felt sick.

At first, he was aggressive, his tone sharp and demanding. But something shifted when I didn't respond. His voice softened, almost... patient. ""Look,"" he said, ""I'm not here to cause trouble. I just want what's owed."" Against my better judgment—or maybe because I had nothing left to lose—I agreed to meet him.

We met in a small café downtown, the kind of place where no one asks questions. I sat with cash in my pocket and a coffee that had long since gone cold. When he arrived, I was struck by how unremarkable he looked. He wasn't what I'd imagined. No sinister aura, no flashy bravado. Just a man with a forgettable face—and eyes that felt too sharp, too knowing.

""Well, I'll be damned,"" he said, smiling like an old friend. ""You actually showed up.""

I shouldn't have stayed, but I did. We talked—or rather, he spoke, and I listened. Hours seemed to pass, the cash in my pocket forgotten. Bob had this way of pulling information from me without realizing it. Every detail I shared seemed to excite him, his gaze growing brighter, more intense. It wasn't until he leaned forward, his voice low and conspiratorial, that I felt the full weight of his presence.

""You know,"" he said, almost casually, ""I could help you get back at her.""

I laughed—sharp, bitter, hollow. ""And why would you want to help me?""

His grin widened, but there was no warmth in it. ""Let's just say I have a vested interest in people like Sarah getting what they deserve. You, though... you're interesting. I'd hate to see you waste an opportunity.""

I wanted to leave. My gut told me to walk away and never look back. But I stayed. Maybe it was his words or how his gaze seemed to hold me in place. Or perhaps I just didn't care anymore.

That first meeting set the tone for what came next. He reached out again, and I answered. I can't explain why. Curiosity? Desperation? Whatever it was, I got drawn deeper into his orbit. He always had a way of making it seem like I was the one seeking him out.

Over time, he pried more out of me—my anger, regrets, and connection to Sarah. Each piece of information seemed to light a spark in him like he was piecing together some grand puzzle. I should have been alarmed by how much he seemed to enjoy it, but I was too numb to care.

""You're wasted on her, you know,"" he told me once. ""All that anger, all that hurt—just sitting there, eating you alive. What if you could do something about it?""

I never answered him, not directly. But I kept showing up. I don't know what I was hoping for—closure, maybe, or just someone to tell me what to do. Bob never gave me answers, though. He gave me tools. Options.

And then, one day, he was gone.

The last message I got from him was cryptic, just like everything else about him. ""Laying low for a while. Take care of yourself—and Tom.""

Looking back, I'm unsure what scares me more: how much of myself I gave away to Bob or how much of him still lingers in me.

The clock ticking breaks me from my musing, and my evening unfolds like a well-rehearsed play. Shoes by the door. Briefcase on the counter. Dinner preparations begin at 6:15. As the food cooks, I guide Tom to his spot in the living room.

""Hungry?"" I ask, not expecting an answer. He twitches slightly and scurries around. Seeing him okay, I finally decided to go to the kitchen.

I prepare two bowls with practiced precision. Mine is a microwaved lasagna, while Tom's is a carefully measured mixture of food and some medicine I searched online based on the guidebook. It was working, so I continued to feed it to him.

A scratching sound comes from the corner. ""Patience,"" I whisper. ""It's almost done. Just relax, bud"". I said just as the scratching stopped.

Dinner is ready, and I move to the living room. I turn on the TV. The news drones about missing cases. The numbers keep rising in our town three this month alone. I changed the channel—it was too depressing.

Tom gets agitated when they show photographs. I feed him carefully, watching with quiet satisfaction as he accepts each spoonful.

Night falls, bringing a different silence to the house, and I stare at the ceiling. Not like before. My mind keeps memories that refuse to fade. Perhaps I missed her more than I thought, but her betrayal left me hollow.

It's just Tom and me now. Tucked in the sleeping area I made for him, he whimpers softly as I head to bed, his eyes following my every move.

""Good night, Tom,"" I whisper as I drift off, feeling his gaze from the darkness. Sometimes, I hear him trying to speak, but that's impossible. Pets don't talk. At least, mine doesn't anymore.

As I felt myself slipping off, I knew I was in for another rough night.

I woke violently, jerked from another nightmare. A sigh escapes my lips as consciousness creeps back, leaving me groggy and disoriented. It's been like this since last month—the nightmares, the cold sweats. Then I feel my heart grow heavier, I don't know why, but it gets like this.

Sarah used to say I talked in my sleep. Now Tom listens instead, his eyes darting to mine the moment I wake. Sometimes, I think I see Sarah's face in those reflections.

The day everything changed is burned into my mind with perfect clarity. The wooden floors in our home still creak in that particular way—the third board from the kitchen entrance.

Sarah always avoided it when slipping out for her ""afternoon walks."" Something bitter and dark coiled in my stomach as I counted those walks. Twice a week became three times, then four.

Thomas from next door would wave to me every morning. ""Beautiful day, isn't it?"" he'd say, standing by his mailbox in that expensive running gear he'd started wearing. He was on Such a health kick—Sarah had mentioned it over dinner once, twice, and many more times. ""The neighbors say he's really transformed himself,"" she'd say, not meeting my eyes. I wonder if she noticed that she was repeating herself more and more, day by day.

Then came the excuses. Even when I saw them together, they were getting too confident. Several times, I threw hints at Thomas' wife; she knew but denied it harder than I did.

I found the truth in pieces, each discovery like a knife twisting deeper. I had a phone here. A misplaced note there. Text messages that painted pictures I couldn't unsee.

Fifteen years of marriage reduced to evidence of betrayal, cataloged in my mind like specimen slides under a microscope. Each revelation changed something in me and broke down another barrier between what I was and what I could become.

The funny thing about betrayal is that it awakens parts of you that you never knew existed. Some people just take their losses and move on, but others... Others find ways to make things right. I think I just needed the right person to push me.

However, by the end, it led me to Tom. At least I got something out of it.

Dragging myself from bed with a renewed sense of purpose. My morning routine unfolds with practiced precision—fix the bed, check the blackout curtains, and collect my pet from his sleeping area.

Tom's quite heavy now, healthier than before. ""Almost there,"" I whisper, my voice catching as we pass Sarah's photo in the hallway. That helpless smile she wore still mocks me, but I shake it off and continue to the living room.

I placed him in his spot in the living room and prepared breakfast for the two of us; the usual…

The doorbell's sharp ring fractures the silence. ""mhnn"" must be the neighbors again.

Tom grows restless at the sound—he always does when we have visitors. ""Now, let's go to your special place again, okay, bud.""

The storage space on the stairs has become Tom's sanctuary in cases like this. ""Just for a little while,"" I whisper soothingly, stroking his still-injured flesh. ""We don't want to make our guests uncomfortable, do we?"".

A whimper answers me—so quiet now, barely audible. Such improvement from those early days of screeching. Back when Tom still thought Sarah would save him.

 The stitches are healing nicely. Can't risk making visitors uncomfortable with his... condition. 

I straighten my tie and check my reflection. The smile in the mirror looks almost natural now, though something wild dances behind my eyes. Practice makes perfect, after all.

Sarah never appreciated my dedication to self-improvement. Neither did Thomas, in the end. But Tom... Tom understands. He has no choice but to understand.

Another performance, I say.

But before I can reach for the handle, the silence shatters as the door explodes inward, cold metal snapping around my wrists before I can even react, as I was slammed into the floor.

Several moments later, police are flocking into my house. Well… the fun's over. It was my mistake thinking I could go on like this for much longer. But there are more pets to discover, especially where I think I'm going.     

The click of the handcuffs feels like the final period at the end of one story—and the beginning of another. In the background, I can hear Tom whimpering from his room. Poor boy. He never did learn to stay quiet when it mattered most.

Bob warned me this might happen when I accepted his deal. 'Some people just won't understand my work,' he'd said. And that's fine. It's too bad, though—Tom should've had a friend. But there was a hiccup with that one. Things happen.' Bob's catchphrase, as always, echoes in my mind.

Bob said he found her along with Tom but got careless and freed her to that extent. 

Bob had pictures, and when I saw their faces staring back at me, I guess that's when I lost whatever humanity I had left.

Seeing them stripped bare like that reminded me too much of the day I found them together. The memory clouded my thoughts more than I ever expected. Maybe that's when I stopped thinking altogether.

—------------------------------------------------------------

POV: Det. Cortez.

In all my years wearing the badge, I've seen it all—gruesome murders, serial killers, kidnappers. But nothing, nothing could have prepared me for what we walked into that day. Even now, as he sits in his cell, Michael Donovan hums that damnable tune as if the horrors we uncovered meant nothing.

I've witnessed the aftermath of grief—what it can do to a man. But this... this is something else entirely. Looking back, I should have seen the signs. Maybe I sympathized too much with him. Don't get me wrong, I don't condone what he did, but as someone whose own wife walked out, I understood—at least a little—how he became the monster in this story.

We first crossed paths with Michael Donovan while investigating the disappearance of Thomas Redfield. Redfield's wife—a poor, desperate woman—still clung to hope, even after discovering her husband's infidelity.

That's when Michael entered the picture. Word had spread about the affair between Thomas and Michael's wife. We got that from talking to the neighbors and, of course, Thomas's wife.

When we first interviewed Michael, I remember how calm he seemed, almost unnaturally, for a man whose wife had just betrayed him. We were expecting rage, bitterness, and maybe a few threats when we mentioned we were looking for Thomas. But instead, he simply said, ""I don't know anything,"" and slammed the door in our faces. I remember hearing whimpering—like a dog—coming from inside. I didn't think much of it at the time. I should have.

A few weeks later, we got a call from a local butcher. He reported something odd in his dumpster: suspicious meat that smelled unlike anything he'd encountered. My partner and I responded immediately, regretting not wearing double gloves. We found Sarah Donovan's face staring back at us when we lifted the garbage bag. My partner lost his lunch while I stood frozen, staring at the woman we'd been looking for—along with Thomas.

We'd seen plenty of bodies before, but this… this was different. The forensics team later said it looked like someone had tried to turn Sarah's features into something... animalistic. They described the modifications to her bones and limbs with surgical precision. She had died in the process.

Our investigation took us to a bootleg medical clinic run by a man dealing in fake IDs and offering shady stitching services to local gangs. We were too late when we tracked him down through surveillance footage. The bastard was gone.

But we did get something. A café near the clinic had a curious face on their cameras: Michael Donovan. What was he doing there?

We'd been watching him for a day when something hit me like a freight train. Despite his coworkers' comments about a new pet, there were no records of him visiting any pet stores. That's when it all clicked—Sarah Donovan's mutilated features, when we found her, slammed into me.

We raided his house at dawn, knowing he'd be most vulnerable. What we found inside made even the toughest officers falter.

Thomas sat motionless, his sunken eyes staring blankly at us, his hollow cheeks etched with suffering. His hands and feet had been amputated above the wrists and below the thighs, leaving him with grotesque, stunted limbs. Makeshift ears and a tail—crafted from his own severed appendages—had been surgically attached to his body. His mouth and throat were slashed, the wounds crudely stitched back together. The smell was suffocating—a nauseating mix of antiseptic and decay, like meat left to rot. We immediately called for medical support, but no one dared touch the victim.

And Michael? He came quietly, humming that same damned tune as we led him to the car. He looked almost casual as if he'd just finished another day at the office.

I walked out of that house, the weight of the stench and the silence clinging to me like a second skin. Michael sat in the back of the car, smiling—unnervingly casual, as though he was going for a stroll. But his eyes… they weren't dead, not exactly. No, that would've been easier to understand. They were something worse: empty, hollow, like staring into an endless void.

I stopped and stared at him through the car window. My hand clenched into a fist, the leather of my gloves creaking as my knuckles turned white. My pulse roared in my ears, drowning out the voices around me. Every instinct screamed to pull him out of that car, to wipe that smile off his face.

But I didn't move. I stood there, frozen in the tangled mess of it all.

What happened to you, Donovan? How does someone go from being a husband—a man who built a life, a future—with someone to this? Did you even know what you were doing? Do you care? Treating another human being like... a pet. Like something less than nothing.

My grip loosened, but I didn't feel any calmer. I didn't feel anything at all. I turned and walked away, leaving him in that car, still wearing that damn smile.

So I want for the high-achieving business girlies (or literally anyone) to help me with this scenario.

  
How do I know if a guy is just intrigued about me and my business OR is actually into ME.

  
I have a business. It is quite exciting and I have learned a lot. I followed this guy (kind of knew him from my past in passing) on Instagram and he started DM'ing me. He also had a business of his own so we had a lot of things to talk about. We covered literally everything from workouts to business books to podcasts to even where we want to live in the future to what our days look like.  He has asked me questions about my life and I asked him questions about his: both business and personal. It has been a very mutual (multiple times a day) back-and-forth Instagram voice messages, a photo here and there, and text messages. We are talking at least 15+ messages a day from each side non-stop for the past 5-6 days.

  
I really like his drive, his personality, and practically all his values/interests match mine. As an entrepreneur, it is hard to find people that really understand the experiences you go through and he does. We are meeting for coffee in a few days (he asked) but I do not want to get the wrong impression.

[20M] [19F],"My boyfriend 20/M and I 19/F,  have been dating for 2 years and not once said I love you to each other. I feel I do love him but I would feel more comfortable with him saying it first. We live together and have separate jobs but still spend basically all time together since we're both kinda loners. 
We met at a library, I was searching for my next read when I catch him looking at me while sitting through the audio books. We catch up a conversation and keep in touch. After a few dates we impulsively move in together and start dating. Since then he's never been distant or showed any sort of toxicity. But he's never shown any sort of simple affection. He's never hugged me just because or, kissed me in public or anything like that. When I'm upset he just puts on this doe like face, not too obvious and it shouldn't upset me but it does.
Despite his unaffectionate personality, we've always had a very healthy physical side of the relationship. However recently, he's wanted to have sex alot more but no intercourse. That's the weird part. This past month-ish, he usually just wants to go down on me which I'm all for, but it just seemes a bit off. Just last night we carry on with our nightly routine, eat, tv, sex, then shower. 
After I came he lifted his head and told me to look at him but, he's been asking that every time so I just pushed my head in the pillow and moaned to maybe catch his attention elsewhere. He slowly climbes over me and grabbes my face pleading for me to look at him (which in his case is absolutely crazy), but I resist, and omg. He basically sits me up, and his naked dick slips past my vaj and sits on my stomach like he's measuring it. I finally lift my head and as soon as our eyes meet he cums up to my neck. I just bury my eyes deeper into his while he quickly kisses me then pulls away. Just for a second I thought he was actually going to tell me. But instead he tells me he thinks my ph is off. This type of behavior is normal between us but it just made me feel bad considering.
I get up to clean his children out of my neck folds and later we go to bed. He has really bad insomnia so I'm trained on sleeping with the tv on. And with the glow of the tv, it's relatively easy to see what's going on. So I'm up against my stack of pillows clutching his arm, just about to fall asleep and he carefully fixes himself on his side and lightly touches my face. Usually if I'm awake I'll push myself into him but this time I didn't. He does a few more tests making sure I'm asleep and after there is not one strand of hair left infront of my face, he lets the softest, biggest breath out. My mind races, I know its coming. He's finally going to say he loves me. I can feel my heart beating against his arm as he starts rubbing my face. He quietly says I, but then he cuts himself off short after he says it. I want to grip my teeth together as badly as he wanted to look at me, but I resist once more as to not give away my disguise. 
He goes again. I know he's going to say it. ""I.. can feel your heart beating are you awake?"" His hand continues sliding across my face and I say yes. His other hand unclings itself from my grasp and searches it's way onto my lower back moving towards my shoulders and rubs me for a moment. Netflix asks if we're still watching and we sit in absolute nothingness. I'm drifting and he brings my nic up to my mouth for me to hit it then puts it under the pillow and soon we fall asleep. 
This morning today, he's not in the bed when I wake up. I genuinely pannic because he's never once been gone from the bed when I wake up. He's ALWAYS watching TV on mute or on his phone when I wake up. I grab my phone and check if he's texted me while I run to the kitchen. No text, and he's not in the kitchen. I search the house and don't find him. I sit on the couch about to cry (I'm completely convinced he's left me). Then, he just walks into the apartment, kicking snow everywhere and telling me how he seen a frozen frog in a puddle. I look over at him and he's got one high heel on and one wedge heal. He took out the trash. My mind blurrs and I assume he doesn't see the tears inches away from falling down my face. He smiles at me (weird of him) and slips off shoes. He walks into the kitchen bring out a coffee mug for me. The rest of our day carries on normally. We've never been too affectionate towards each other but today a certain intensity kicked into our insults.

I am trying to recover from the first relapse of my first restrictive ED I haven’t been able to pull myself out of. I’m not going to lie, I have mixed feelings on what my dietician considers a benchmark for a full recovery (higher than any weight I’ve been in my life?), but at this particular point, I am at least theoretically committed. 

And for the first part of gaining weight, nailed it! Gold stars all round! Normal labs for the first time in almost a year and getting close-ish to the bottom of a healthy weight range.

Now, I don’t look sick. I look relatively similar to how I have looked for a decade (slightly underweight, but not in a way that concerns people much). My partner isn’t panicking, my labs are good so my GP isn’t panicking either. I deprioritised treatment and tried to focus on the other bits of my life that were falling apart (you know, like my job). 

Mostly, that was fine. I didn’t gain weight, but also didn’t lose it.

Then came a stressful project. That’s all it took.

Everything came back. I was paralysed by indecision and food was overwhelming, reverting to coffee whenever I even considered it. Lying about eating was second nature, so natural it didn’t feel like I was lying. 

On day three with no food except coffee with milk, I called an eating disorder hotline yesterday with one question: what do I eat? 

They told me to go to the emergency department. This is a comical suggestion (it’s an underfunded, understaffed hospital that would, presumably, either send me home given how ridiculous the question is or run a drug test given how I look and the demographic make up of the area).

So now I’m still here, on day four, with the deadline still there and me still having only had coffee. Still technically wanting to recover, in theory. 

And all I need, at this particular point in time, is someone to give me something incredibly easy to eat. ",8,1737601020.0,Eatingdisordersover30,9,1.0,False

1. For when Sunny reveals his multiple bodies to Nephis: 

Nephis: “So you’re saying you run a coffee shop part time while fighting terrible abominations in a death zone?”
Sunny: “Of course not what kinda of crazy person would do that. *pause* I run a coffee shop full time and fight abominations part time, running a coffee shop is hard work you know.”

2. Sunny makes blessing

Nephis: I swear to god Sunny if I find an advertisement in the description of my sword…
Sunny: *takes it back and quickly runs to another room*

3. Sunny bullying that poor guy who challenged him while pretending to be weak

4. Sunny having an argument with himself (Lord of Shadows)

5. Sunny having multiple bodies each with different personalities and having them argue with each other.

**Plot Idea:** 

Muse A and B were childhood friends. They were inseparable. Their families always thought they would get married. That was Muse A's older brother died. She fell off the deep end. At first it wasn't noticeable as she followed in his footsteps, becoming an army medic. It was only noticeable just how bad things had gotten when she came home. Years battling her drug abuse and bouncing from shelter to shelter. Muse A is pretty sure her life will never get better. Meanwhile, Muse B? He is a rich man who owns a company doing something. They live completely opposite lives. The two lost touch years ago. That is until this Christmas. When Muse B finally agrees to fly home to New York for Christmas. He is not looking forward to being here at all. That is until he runs into the homeless woman holding up the line at the local coffee shop. Can he save her? Maybe, just maybe, she is the reason he is supposed to come home? Their folks always said the two were like magnets, always going to find their way back to each other. 




**Writing Sample** 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.


The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left. Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. 


The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrian slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.


That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. 



Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world. ""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. 



Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. 




The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.


PREGNANT.


In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.



All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow. With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa,"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.



Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

Some context: 4 year on and off again relationship with my (F23) ex (28M). 

I won’t spiral into details but it a was a pretty toxic, back and forth relationship, lasting only a few short months at a time. I’ve been trying to end things with my ex since July 24, but if you’ve ever dated a NARC, it doesn’t happen until they want it to happen. 

Finally in Nov of 24 he ended things and I cut all forms of communication. 
 
It was hard because breakups just suck in general, but this is something I had been mentally preparing for, for months at that point. I communicated, expressed, comprised — we’re just not each other’s person and I’ll wish him well. 

Anyways, a guy I’ve known for about 6 years reached out to me asking me on a date. I was very clear about my past and that I am not actively dating, but I wouldn’t mind catching up with him platonically. Things is, i’m 23 and spent the past 4 years on a guy who literally did not respect me — and this guy is cute! I wouldn’t mind getting to know him and putting myself out there. 

Is it too soon? Would it be a bad idea just grab a coffee with this guy and stroll a nearby walking trail?

If I’m being totally honest I really don’t like not having you in my life hah 😅.” 

  This brought back a lot of emotion for me and made me realize I definitely was not fully over him. I decided to meet up with him for drinks and we had a nice time but never brought up the past relationship or intentions. We just caught up and it was lighthearted. It made me realize how much I missed him and truly valued my time with him. 

  A few weeks after this I decided to just reach out directly to see where his head was at. I said: “Really glad we got to catch up the other night. To be honest, I had been really missing having you in my life, and when you texted me last month, I wasn’t sure where your head was at. Just want to make sure we’re on the same page. Totally cool if you’d want to talk about it in person.” 

He responded to me: 
“Yeah I was really missing you too. I wanted to reach out earlier but also wanted to give you/us space. I’d really like to explore a friendship with you if possible but totally understand if that’s not possible for us rn. And yeah happy to talk about it more in person too at any point.” 

Now I’m feeling confused on his intentions/feelings. His initial text sounded emotionally charged and like he still had feelings, but after I directly asked him he just wants to explore a friendship? The wording is very vague. I honestly would love to get back with him but also understand that may not be possible. I think hearing from him when he invited me to get drinks really set me back in my healing. Any advice appreciated!!

I made him some coffee and made sure to tip him well. He’s a human. Even if he is a little grouchy he deserves some love and care. And then I had an epiphany.

She is a very charming, funny and beautiful person and we’ve shared a lot of great memories together. 
She has had and currently has alot of emotional problems. Throughout the entirety of our relationship she has had a tough time with anxiety, self-love etc. I have always been there for her. Every time she’s felt sad I’ve been there to comfort her and take care of her. I still live at home as does she, but I ended up basically moving into her apartment as time went on because with each passing day I took on more and more responsibility as what could be seen as ‘her caretaker’. Her parents typically stay at a house they own about an hours drive away. Because of her emotional health and lack of structure I lived with her for the better part of one and a half years, cooking her food, cleaning her apartment and, with whatever time i had left, tending to her emotional problems.
I ended up not seeing my family or coming home to my own bed more than at most once every three weeks, typically less. My social life started falling apart, with my friends now referring to the period as when I was practically a ghost. I also started to lose interest in my hobbies and passions, with my teachers noticing how I as a once very dedicated musician started practicing and working a lot less on my passion.
I lost my sense of self in many ways, finding myself completely disinterested in everything I once held close, unsure of who I was, what I wanted and where I wanted to go in life.
She had never told anyone but me about her mental health, not family nor friends, leaving only me to tend to her as the rest were left in the dark. Although I tried countless times to express how I couldn’t be the sole pillar of her support system she never made a change. She never told her parents, she never sought out professional help, she never tried to find ways to support herself.

A key part for this post is an incident that occurred while we were on vacation last summer. Me, my girlfriend and my friend went on vacation. And one evening, as we were leaving for dinner, my girlfriend refrained from joining us. We went out for dinner and a beer, and when we came back I found my girlfriend sitting out on the balcony floor in a crawled up position. She told me that while we’d been gone she had climbed over the balcony railing with the intent of taking her life. Thankfully she had a change of heart and she came to no harm. However I drank a couple cups of coffee and stayed up all night watching her and waiting for the suicide hotline to open. I’ve spent a lot of time worrying and being fearful for her safety since.

With time I felt myself crumble under the responsibility, under her emotional luggage as well as my own and my confusion and lost sense of self. I had a complete emotional breakdown about three months ago, where I expressed how I just couldn’t take it anymore. After refusing every time it was suggested up until that day, she finally began looking for professional help.
That day I was petrified of my desire to break up, we stuck with it and I’ve been trying to find my footing since. However, although she’s gotten better the feelings have stuck with me. The problems she had have not magically vanished, it will take time and I truly hope she finds some comfort. The thing is that I’ve sort of reached my limit when it comes to tending to these problems, I’ve tried my best but I’ve got nothing more to give. Since my breakdown I’ve forced her to let me stay at my own house without guilting me through expressing how “deeply saddened she gets” because I’m gone for three or more nights, something that has never been possible previously.
While spending more time by myself I’ve rediscovered a lot of things. I’ve once again found the spark of my passions, playing my instrument for hours on end. I’ve discovered new wants and exciting things in my life and I’m having a blast, feeling thrilled to be my own person again.
I find myself getting deeply frustrated and filled with anxiety when she texts me looking for emotional support because of stuff like “my friend hung out with their friend without asking me”.  Or writing about things that she’s sad about such as “I had a breakdown in the stairwell because my parents said I have to cook tonight” or “You haven’t texted that you love me”. 
I don’t want to get upset because I know her feelings are real, but since my breakdown I just can’t help it, I can’t take it anymore.
She has said multiple times that she doesn’t feel loved and appreciated by me which is something that cuts me so deep as I’ve literally devoted my entire life to her.

To the point. I think I can finally admit that I don’t want to be in this relationship anymore. I’m a recently graduated 20 year old and I feel really excited to continue finding myself and pursuing exciting things in life.
However my empathy and my feeling of responsibility for my girlfriend goes so deep that I can’t even come close to actually breaking up. I fear for her. Through neglect she’s lost a large majority of her friendships and her mother is too self obsessed to truly support my girlfriend. I fear that without me she’ll be overwhelmed by the huge sense of loneliness she already has, and due to her history I fear for her safety. 

What actions can I take to prioritise my own well-being and in turn build up courage? And possibly even ensure her safety.

There’s a classmate I wanted to befriend because of their engaging conversation style.

In class, I’m anxious & don’t speak much, but during this, I actually found the courage to.

———

While we were watching the teachers to see if they needed any assistance, I first said something to them.

⚪️ They joked about me looking serious, saying that every time they looked over at me, I had an expression that was like I was going to get a mugshot, which made me laugh. It felt like they were paying attention to me, and when they gave me eye contact, I couldn’t stop smiling!

⚪️ After that, there wasn't much, but they mentioned the chorus (other students) behind us were good at singing.


———

There might be more because I can't fully recall.

We had a break like a few days after. Now it's been almost a month back in school.

I really want to befriend them, but I have no chances. We don't sit near each other and rarely have a chance for interaction. 

They also have friends that they always speak to.

I thought of something. I have a friend who’s also into music at school. I could ask them about that person, but like that would be weird… unless I had a reason to mention them.
