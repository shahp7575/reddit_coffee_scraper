Bonus points if it’s a spot where I can meet new people or hang out with a nice crowd.
I’m new here and would love to find a cozy place to relax, have some good conversations, and maybe make a few new connections. Do you know of any coffee spots that are open late at night or even 24/7?
Thanks in advance for your recommendations!",1,1733281066.0,u_No-Coyote-8,0,1.0,False

My entire world had been turned upside down in the span of mere minutes. The job I had worked so hard for almost my whole life turned out to be a living nightmare. I had been forced to torture a patient and had seen orderlies slam a patient to the ground and most likely break one of her bones. And it was still my first day. 



As I rolled Todd into his room, I was struck by how plain and depressing it looked. It looked more like a prison cell than a hospital room, as it should’ve looked. The only bit of individuality inside the room was a carving into the wall. ‘Todd was here!’ I closed the door behind us. Once I had completely rolled Todd into the room, he sprang up from his chair and practically threw himself into his bed. 



“Home sweet home! Thanks, Nurse Cassandra,” he said with a chuckle as he shimmied around in bed. I stared at him a little dumbfounded over how he had so easily just left from the wheelchair after such a horrible procedure. He noticed my worry and waved his hand at me. “It’s not too bad once you get used to it.” 



“I-I’m…so sorry, Todd,” I told him, gripping the handles of the wheelchair and trying to keep myself from crying in front of him. I looked back up from the chair and saw that he was sitting in bed and looking at me. 



“I know you didn’t mean to do it. So don’t sweat it, okay? This place is…fucked up. And you’re going to do and see some really bad shit. Just try not to forget who you are. And do your best to stick it to Nurse Whore,” he said with a tired smile. I finally got a good look at Todd and noticed just how malnourished he was. 



“Are you eating properly?” I asked him, pushing his wheelchair to the side and quickly pulling my stethoscope out. This caught him off guard and he quickly started backing up in his bed, but I caught up to him before he could get too far away. I quickly began to listen to his heart and his lungs. 



“I try not to eat the food. They know I don’t take my meds so they try to sneak it into the food.” He explained. Despite how he looked, his heart and lungs sounded just fine. I wish I could’ve done a more thorough check but I did have limited means to test on him. 



“What kind of meds?” I asked, taking my stethoscope off and softly patting it into my palm, my nurse mode completely activated. 



“I wish I knew. But it turns you into one of those zombie patients. And I enjoy my personality so I try not to take them if I can help it.” Todd explained, which got me even more worried about just what type of hell I had sold my soul to. 



“I have to get back to Nurse Taylor,” I told him as I looked over Todd again. “Don’t get yourself killed, please?” Those words came out of my mouth without me even thinking twice. Todd was the first person I had met at Sombra that felt like an actual person. He seemed just as caught off guard as I had been. 



“Hasn’t happened yet, but I promise.” He held up his pinky to me. I couldn’t help but let out a little giggle and wrapped mine around his. I took his wheelchair with me and began to make my way back towards the lobby, only getting lost once which I counted as a win for myself. 



“Ah, there you are Nurse Cassandra. I was beginning to think something had happened to you.” Nurse Taylor was waiting for me in the lobby with Nurse Emily and the receptionist lady I had met on my first day here. “Todd is safely in his room?” she asked as she motioned for Emily to take the chair from me.



“Yes, ma’am. No issues to report.” I sounded like a robot, but it was the only way I could stop myself from becoming too emotional over my current situation. My new tone seemed to make Nurse Taylor absolutely ecstatic. 



“Wonderful!” She clapped her hands together giddily. “Now, if you’d follow me, you’re going to help me administer medication to a few patients. This way you’ll get an idea of how to do it.” She turned on her heels and motioned for me to follow after her. I let out a sigh and followed after her, leaving Emily and the receptionist alone in the lobby. 



I followed after Nurse Taylor as she made her way down the dull grey hallway. Finally, we came up to a room and she opened it up for us to enter. I followed after her and was met with a patient who was smashing his head over and over again on one of the walls of his room. 



“Now, now Mr. Jordan.” Nurse Taylor told the man carefully as she walked over to him and pulled him gently away from the wall. “We’ve talked about this, no hitting yourself, remember?” she asked him. As she pulled him away from the wall I watched, sickened, as most of his forehead skin peeled away and fell to the floor. 



“Shouldn’t we get him some medical attention?” I asked, wanting to help the man desperately. But Nurse Taylor simply laughed in my face as she reached into her pocket and pulled out a pill. She held it up to Mr. Jordan but he didn’t seem to react at all. 



“Come give me a hand, Cassandra.” She motioned for me to come over. I took a small step forward, thinking of how I could get out of it, but eventually, I just gave up and walked over to her. “Good girl. Now, take this pill. I’ll hold Mr. Jordan’s mouth open.” 



I took the pill from her and looked down at it. It was a capsule of sorts, with some kind of black liquid inside of it. I held it between my fingers and watched as Nurse Taylor stuck her fingers into Mr. Jordan’s mouth and forced his jaw open violently. I thought for a second that she was going to rip his jaw off with the force she opened it. I quickly placed the pill in his mouth and stepped back as Nurse Taylor shut his mouth and tipped his head back so that he could swallow it. 



“There’s a good boy!” She smiled, patting Mr. Jordan on the head and carefully leading him to his bed. He seemed almost completely catatonic, and Taylor led her to bed without much issue. She tucked him into bed and turned to leave him, his forehead bleeding profusely from the gash he’d created. 



“S-shouldn’t we bandage him?” I asked Nurse Taylor as she turned to leave Mr. Jordan alone in bed. She stared at me like I’d just spoken some foreign language at her. “So that it won’t become infected?” 



“Don’t bother with something so pointless dear.” She patted me on the head like I was an idiot and walked out into the hall. Before I could even think of trying to help Mr. Jordan, Nurse Taylor grabbed me by the wrist and yanked me away from his room. She led me to another few patients' rooms. Each one was inhabited by a husk of a human, with one of them, a girl who looked barely above 18, tied down to the bed. I was told that this had happened to her because she kept trying to chew through her wrists. She was bound to her bed by her arms and legs and even her neck was tied down to the bed. 



“This is inhumane…” I mumbled as I continued to follow after Nurse Taylor. She stopped in her tracks and I actually bumped into her. I quickly backed up and watched as she spun on her heels to stare at me. 



“Oh sweetie, these aren’t people anymore. They’re addicts.” She was so condescending that it made me sick. Staring at her, for the first time in my life, I actually felt like punching someone in the face. “They made the choices that led to them being treated here. They stopped being human when they decided to become addicts.” I was disgusted by how she could say this about people who needed help. 



Before I could even raise my voice against her, I felt a lingering presence behind me. “What the hell are you doing?” A tired posh voice asked us. I turned my head to find that Constantine Sinclair was standing behind me, nursing a cup of coffee with his umbrella now open and shielding him from the fluorescent lights above his head. 



“S-Sir! I was just showing our new nurse here how to correctly deal with our patients!” Nurse Taylor’s demeanor had shifted again. Now she seemed like a desperate housewife who had an abusive husband. “I was also educating her about our addicts and such,” she said with a forced chuckle, grabbing my arm and pulling me over to her. 



“Hm,” Sinclair grunted, clearly not giving a shit about what she was saying. He took a long sip of his coffee as he stared down at me and Taylor. As I stared at him, I could’ve sworn that from inside his umbrella I could see two white eyes staring back at me from the void. “Whatever, just make sure she knows her place.” He walked past us without another word. 



Taylor let out a long sigh like she had been holding her breath the entire time that Sinclair had been standing there in front of us. “Goodness me, he’s in such a good mood today!” she said, her face turning red as she watched him walk away. I didn’t think that was the case, he looked like he’d been in an absolute shit mood. 



“That’s all for today, Cassandra. I want you to take everything I’ve taught you to heart. You’ll be given more responsibilities tomorrow, understand?” she asked after she had regained her composure. I wanted to say something back to her, but I figured it would be better to just keep quiet. I was left alone and decided to go back to my room. 



I had come back to the employees-only section and had scanned my card to open the door when one of the nurses suddenly bumped into me and started running away down the hallway. Before I could process that, four other nurses quickly chased after her. 



“W-what’s happening?” I asked one of the nurses inside as I closed the door behind me. She looked at me and looked like she was processing what I had just asked her. 



“Oh, she cracked. Couldn’t take it anymore. Shame really, I liked her.” She shrugged as she looked back down at her clipboard. 



“What’s going to happen to her?” I asked. The clipboard nurse looked at me puzzled, and then, after staring at me for a second, she nodded. 



“You’re new. Well, she’s probably going to Mr. Sinclair’s office. Point of advice sweetie. You don’t want to be sent there.” She tucked her clipboard under her arm and walked away, leaving me more terrified than I’d been before I walked in. I quickly ran past other nurses and ran to my room, quickly slamming the door behind me and feeling a panic attack coming on. 



As I slammed my back against my door and slid down to the floor I noticed that another sticky note had been left on my mirror. I stood up and quickly ran over to the mirror and snatched up the note. To my surprise, it was a doodle of me and who I assumed was Todd together with a heart around us. I was so caught off guard that I let out a snort and giggled to myself as I felt a few tears fall from my cheek. I was sure that Todd was behind this, though I had no idea how he’d managed to sneak into the employees-only section and then into my room. I took the little doodle and stuck it back on my mirror with the others. 



After I took a few minutes to compose myself, I decided to go visit Todd. He was the first person I had met at Sombra that felt like an actual person. He seemed just so easy to talk to. I walked out of the employees-only section and out into the hallways. As I walked down them and toward Todd’s room I had to walk past several husks and I did my best to check on them and make sure that they were okay. Most of them were unresponsive to my questions and only seemed to react when I poked and prodded at them. A few of them had serious injuries, and I did my best to bandage them with the few bandaids and pieces of gauze I had in my pockets. 



After ‘treating’ the last husk I came across I walked over to Todd’s room and opened the door. I was surprised to find him holding a chair over his head like he was about to smash me over the head with it. 



“Oh shit, it’s you!” he said in surprise, quickly setting the chair back down and letting out an exasperated laugh. “I thought you were gonna be an orderly or Nurse Whore.” He sat down on the chair he was about to hit me with and let out a long loud laugh. 



“You could’ve killed me!” I panted, clutching my heart from the sheer panic that had come over me. “More importantly, how did you get into my room?” I demanded to know, crossing my arms at him and doing my best to act tough. 



“Huh?” He asked, clearly confused. “Are you crazy, lady? If you think I was able to sneak into the employees-only section and I’d still choose to stay here, maybe you’re the one who belongs here, not me.” He scoffed, leaning back in the chair and pushing it back to balance on the two back legs. 



“Then…” I looked around his room and noticed that he also had a sticky note stuck to his wall. I walked over quickly to it and got a better look at it. 



“Please, by all means, go through my stuff.” He followed my movements with his eyes and watched as I took the sticky note off of his wall. 



“So, you didn’t draw this?” I asked him, staring at the sticky note that had a doodle of Todd on it. He was smoking a cigarette and flipping me off. It was a good likeness of him. 



“No, that was the doodler,” Todd said, almost losing his balance and falling backward onto the floor. “We’ve got no idea who it is, or why they do it, but they leave those doodles all over the place.” Todd shrugged as he sat up straight in the chair and stood up quickly. “Wanna have a smoke break?” 



“You aren’t allowed to have cigarettes in rehab.” I squinted at him as I stuck the doodle back onto the wall. “Where’d you even get them?” He walked past me and stuck his hand into his pillowcase. And he pulled out a pack of cigarettes, starting to smack the box against his hand. 



“That receptionist gets them for me. In return, I help her carry all the heavy shit she needs to file.” Todd chuckled as he walked past me and out into the hall. I shook my head as I followed after him. Though I really couldn’t judge him, if this place was shaping up to be hell on Earth, then he might as well enjoy his cancer sticks. 



I followed him as he led us to the garden, and thanked him as he held the door open for me. We both picked a bench in the corner of the garden and I sat next to Todd as he sparked his BIC lighter to life and lit his cigarette. 



“So…what are you addicted to?” I asked him, trying and failing to make small talk with him. He stared at me and couldn’t help but laugh in my face. I felt my face go red in embarrassment and I quickly turned to avoid his gaze and cackles. 



“Don’t worry about it. I just love how straightforward you were about it!” He snickered as he took a deep drag of his smoke. “Pills mostly. Xanax, oxy, barbiturates, you name it. Sleeping pills especially.” He held his cigarette in his mouth as he leaned back on the bench and stared up at the sky. “This was supposed to be a fresh start…a fat load of good it did me.” He closed his eyes and let out a tired sigh, a puff of smoke escaping his lips. 



“I’m so sorry.” I reached over and took his hand into mine. “I came here wanting to help people. It’s always been my life’s passion. And now look where it’s gotten me.” I found myself squeezing his hand subconsciously. “I can’t help anyone here…they won’t let me help anyone.” I noticed that I had been squeezing his hand and I quickly let it go. 



“I don’t mean to sound like a dick, but do I have to call you Cassandra?” I looked up at him and saw that he was now staring at me with a smile. “It’s way too stuffy and formal, I’d rather call you something easier.” He said with a wink. He stared at me for a moment before looking up at my hair. “What about Red? I like that much better.” 



I smiled at him and let out a little giggle. “It isn’t very original, but I like it,”  I said as I pushed a lock of my hair back into place behind my ear. Todd nodded and smiled back at me. Suddenly he spat out his cigarette and quickly stomped on it. He then grabbed my arm and yanked me out of the bench, pulling me into the bush behind it. “W-what are you…?” Before I could process everything he quickly covered my mouth with his hand and shushed me. 



“Get away from me!” A girl screamed before suddenly falling in front of us where we had been sitting on the bench beforehand. I quickly shoved myself into Todd’s chest as I watched the horror before me unfold. 



“The less you fight this, the quicker it’ll end.” A tired posh voice told the screaming woman. It was Constantine Sinclair. I watched from behind the bush as he placed his foot on the woman’s head and held it there as she squirmed uncontrollably. “Well get on with it, this bitch is going to ruin my shoes at this rate.” It sounded like he was talking to someone but I didn’t see anyone else there. 



The woman was suddenly bitten in the face by a tar-covered creature that had emerged from seemingly nowhere. I couldn’t help but let out a horrified and muffled scream, lucky for me Todd still had his hand over my mouth stopping any noise from escaping. The creature ripped large chunks of flesh off of the woman, and before our eyes, it had devoured every ounce of the woman. There wasn’t a single sign that she had even been there. 



“God damn it, you got blood on my suit. When will you learn to eat your food less sloppily?” Sinclair hissed in anger, as he walked away. The tar figure seemed to disappear into his shadow as he walked away. I looked up at Todd and he slowly and carefully lowered his hand from my mouth. 



“That’s what happens when you’re a patient here.” He let out a pained sigh. I stared back at where the woman had once been. Just what had I gotten myself into?

I would preferably want it to work like the regular boundary walls when my hands/head get near some object I define (like a coffee table), it would be blue and red depending on how close I am to it.  That's what I thought the layout app was for, but I guess it is mainly just a visualization tool.  Is this perhaps coming in a future update?  If anyone has information on something like this for the Quest 3, whether modded, an additional app, or otherwise, that would be great (but preferably a solution that still allows for warranty if something goes wrong with my VR, as I just got it).  Thanks!

On a second note, seeing the level tool in this app is really cool, if I ever have to hang stuff on a wall, it would be nice to be able to use that tool if I don't have a level handy (though I wish the lines weren't so thick).  However, trying to make anything straight using passthrough is not really feasible.  It just makes me exited to see how AR/MR can be used in the future.",1,1733280860.0,Quest3,1,1.0,False

1h65t7k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h65t7k,Update on the wine-soaked Hokas,"First of all, huge thanks to everyone who offered advice, support, and jokes!! 

Update: so I know the general consensus is that the wine looked cooler than the white, and I hear you. But seeing as it was their literal first outing, I really to try & salvage them if possible.

Between my mom’s advice and everything here, I was feeling overwhelmed. The dry cleaners had closed, I’m in the UK & can’t get everything that was suggested, and I don’t have many of the more basic cleaners on hand (you can bet I won’t be caught unawares again!).

I elected to rinse with cold water first. The wine had been sitting for hours, but I tried to rinse whatever I could. Then I followed the directions for the one stain remover I could get at the corner shop—Dr Beckmann Stain Devil Fruit & Drinks. It has red wine pictured & listed on the front of the bottle.

It said to dilute the contents in warm water, and then soak items for several hours. I soaked the most soiled one for about two hours, as well as the damaged laces and my socks. I could hardly believe it when I checked on them about an hour and a half later.

For good measure & the sake of balance, I put everything including the spared shoe in for a little bit longer. If anything yellowed or whatnot, it would at least be shared, right? What do I know—I bought white shoes in the first place, so I don’t think I should be trusted.

The lighting in the flat isn’t great, but I think they look….bland and back to normal? For the most part? I agree, not nearly as fun as that nice pink, but I can always get that tie dye back, if I change my mind.

May do another soak once I’ve seen them in the light of day. Thanks all for the jokes and the suggestions—much appreciated levity & insight! I’m glad to have found my red wine spillers. Cheers!!! 🍷",4,1733280519.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

Include your first name or initial. The more detailed the question the more detailed the answer can be. The cards answer your true question so ask what you really want to know. 

If you want to know about someone else - “what does he/she think of me?” Tell me what you want from them/what your relationship with them is… So it’s NOT spying. 👍🏻 If it IS about another person, include their name or initials.

I will not ask you for money once you ask your question (I do have a “buy me a coffee link” on my review page and I never turn down tip)

I might resort to binging in the future too. But it's not the end guys.

I tried to make friends at the beginning of the semester but I just couldn't. I don't understand what I did wrong. I texted people to ask what activities they were going to go to during initiation week. I tried to do some small talk with people in my program in the bus. Even asked them to study at a coffee shop but they wanted to study alone since there was soon an exam. I thought they would text me back at another time but no. 

I have the impression that most of the people already have a group of friends. My cousin said that I should really make some friends in my program to have people to study with but I just can't. What could I possibly do wrong? Well, I know that I'm shy and I'm awkward, but I've always had some friends either way.

Do you have some advices to make friends mid year? I already know that some may say to join club but there's not really a lot of club in my uni. What do you talk about with someone you know mostly nothing? And how do you just begin to talk to them? Do you know some ways to approach someone?

1h65nb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h65nb6/the_elf_on_my_shelf_unwound_itself/,The elf on my shelf unwound itself.,"When I was a child, one of my favorite things about the holiday season was the elf on the shelf.  The idea that he was making sure I would stay on the nice list really made Santa feel more realistic. 

After my parents passed, my brother didn't show an interest in it. So I decided to take it home and try and recreate the same magic of Christmas for my own kids.

For the past two years, the new tradition has been a success. My oldest daughter, Kayla, seems to love it almost as much as I did.

Like the past years, I dug through the Christmas decorations for the elf. I'd put him on the coffee table in the living room on December 1st.

Continuously calling it 'the elf' is making my anxiety worse. When I was a kid, we decided to name it Jingles. This is because Jingles has these large gilded bells on his feet.

Anyways, I put Jingles out right before I got ready for bed. My wife, Marcy, had already gone to sleep hours before. I then went through my usual routine of going to the bathroom, making sure the outside doors are locked, then turning off the lights. I laid down on the bed, and after only like 5 seconds shit starts getting weird.

Have you ever ripped a shirt? That's the best way i can describe it. It sounded like cloth ripping. I got back out of bed. I thought it was just the dog spazzing out, I haven't had the time to get him fixed yet. 

I stubbed my pinky toe on the dresser, trying not to make a noise and wake up Marcy. As soon as I opened the bedroom door, I knew something was wrong. Brutus, my GSD, nosed the door all the way open and dove under the blankets. I quietly closed the door, got the gun from my safe, and stepped into the hall.

I went down the stairs and peeked around the corner into the living room. 

Dull moonlight filters in through the windows. A dull amber glow is emanating from the coffee table. Pieces of Jingles were everywhere. It looked like he got shot by birdshot..

In the place of Jingles, was something else. A writhing mass of bright red and white tentacles. They kept twisting to keep the same pose I put Jingles in. There were no features, no eyes, no nose or mouth. Just a vaguely humanoid amalgamation, whose appendages ended in a large hook.

I did what at the time I thought was the best idea. There was no way I was going to let that... thing get any closer to my family.  I silently switched the safety off of my grandfather's 1911. 

As soon as I turned the corner to shoot, the tentacles all undulated at once. The speed which it moved... It was already climbing up my leg. I dropped the gun and tried to peel it off. My face got covered and I panicked. I was digging at the tentacles near my mouth for air. They tried to go in my mouth, I bit down hard. The fluid that came out tasted like sour milk, it also gave off a vapor like smelling salts. I fought the urge to cough. The tentacles went up my nose, I could hear popping and separating. Then the world went black.

What I saw next hasn't left my mind since. Maybe im just stressed from work. Maybe the stress is making me hallucinate? I pray to God that it's just stress. Every time I try to sleep, or blink, I see the same scenes again. In my dream, I saw several terrible, grotesque images.
The first thing I saw was the gift of flesh. Two tentacle beings were standing in front of a Christmas tree.  The tree had pure white tentacles in place of ribbon and tinsel. Pieces of festering viscera, gore, and organs replaced ornaments. At the top of the tree, red tentacles formed an undulating star. From the star, a dull red glow emitted that painted the rest of the scene.

The two tentacle beings began chanting, appearing to begin a ritual of some kind. They rose up and became rigid. Simultaneously, they ripped off their left arm. Fluid gushed from the cavity of severed tentacles as they presented their arm to the other. The process repeated, with each appendage being gifted to the other. Finally, the dream ended in one writhing mass under the pale glow.

The second dream began as a void. I was floating in an all consuming darkness, until I heard him. Dreadful wailing began and slowly got louder.In the distance a pale red glow came in to view. A team of reindeer pulled a sleigh into view 

The deer in the 'Rudolph' position was almost rotted completely through. Pieces of hide fell off, and revealed a skeleton underneath. It had three extra legs. The way they twitched reminded me of the tentacles. Every other reindeer was less decayed, hanging, limp in the harness.

In the sleigh, was a convulsing mass of red and white tentacles. Next to it was a bag made of what looked like human leather. It was stuffed to the seams, overflowing with organs and gore.

They stopped when the lead reindeer was right in my face. The red mass of tentacles around it's head undulated at once, releasing a increasingly bright red light. My whole body radiated in pain as I was slowly erased from the scene.

I woke up from these two visions to Marcy shaking me awake. My eyes snapped open. I was in the living room. All evidence of Jingles was erased. Marcy told me she came down the stairs to make coffee, then saw me unconscious with my gun nearby. The way she looked at me... with such concern, just wanting an answer. It broke something in me, I think. I couldn't answer. I didn't know what to say. I hadn't even had time to process what I just dreamed. If only I could stop now.

I walked up the stairs and put the gun back in the safe without saying a word. When I tried to compose myself and come back downstairs, Marcy had taken Kayla to cheer practice. 

I spent the next three hours looking for Jingles or any sign of him. Brutus refused to leave the bedroom. I found a gilded bell in the master bathroom.

I've tried looking for an answer, an explanation, a similarity. I've tried looking here on reddit, but I haven't found anything. I also didn't have luck on 4chan boards either. Please if you know what this is or what what to do, please let me know.

It's now late evening. Marcy hasn't come back and won't answer my calls. I guess that's good in a way. At least they are safe. 

I'm completely on edge, the sunset kept giving me flashbacks to the light. I unplugged all the lights and tore down the decorations. I cant calm down. Those moments, those scenes just keep playing over and over in my mind. I'm not sure how much more I can take. 


Well, if I don't post an update soon....

Stay safe and Merry Christmas..",2,1733280022.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

In every MCQ I've had before this, in the lectures, and in the textbook (right) I have to reduce the contribution received by the FV of the premiums given to arrive at contribution revenue. 



According to the solution to the question (left), ""Generally the difference between the fair value of dues or other purchases and the amount transferred is classified as a contribution. When, however, the contributions relate to a major ongoing portion of the operation of the organization, the contribution revenues are displayed gross and the cost of the premium is displayed as fund-raising expense.""

  
So, do I only show the contributions gross in the very particular situation when the contribution is designated for the (key words) *mIsSiOn oF tHe OrGaNiZaTiOn*, and show the contributions net of the premiums in all other situations? I also don't understand why the textbook seems to say that premiums are both an expense (first and second paragraphs) and a reduction of revenue (paragraph 3 and passkey). If the real exam questions are actually going to be this niche... I might be cooked like a turkey on Thanksgiving.

If I did that at my job I’d be fired or in a ton of trouble. Mind you I’m in a union and sick time is bundled with my PTO and people rarely “call out”.

My gf is a store manager and shows me texts she gets all the time from call outs.

“Can’t come in today my head hurts”

“Stomach ache” 

“I don’t feel good” 

“I got homework”

Like bro. Seriously?

Be punctual now so you can be punctual later when it matters. How are you gonna learn to be a diligent decent employee with dumb habits like these.

And what makes me real mad is the unionized stores.

If you people are in a Union you better act like it. People in Unions don’t call out for bs reasons.

You think IBEW is gonna be happy to hear I call out numerous times a month?

I’m shocked because Starbucks is a HUGE company with standards.

And it enables its employees to game the system by giving them the option to call out whenever they want basically.

I feel bad for managers like my gf that have to constantly come in to make up for the call outs and the DMs that drill managers for not getting their numbers up or other bs reasons like an uncleanly store or bad out the window times.

Like it’s your corporate policy. Fix it. Do not give PART TIME workers the ability to call out all the time. Punish them.

These are college kids living at home that don’t give af about their team or store. 

I don’t need to work at Starbucks to see how bs this all is.

It’s why I don’t drink coffee.

Sandra Martinez stood by the window, her reflection a cold silhouette against the dark glass. Her reputation preceded her—a manager so ruthless, her employees whispered about her behind closed doors.

""Another late report,"" she muttered, her voice cutting through the silence like a knife. Mark, a junior analyst, had been working overtime for weeks. His pale face was etched with exhaustion, dark circles beneath his eyes telling a story of constant verbal abuse and impossible expectations.

In the break room, hushed conversations had been brewing for months. ""She destroyed Jennifer's career last month,"" whispered Rachel, the HR coordinator. ""Reported her for a minor error, had her transferred to a dead-end department.""

The collective hatred had transformed from water cooler complaints to something darker. Something dangerous.

""We can't take this anymore,"" Tom from accounting said, his fingers tracing the rim of his coffee mug. ""She's ruined too many lives.""

The plan was simple yet intricate. They would invite Sandra to an after-hours performance review—a meeting she'd never refuse, given her obsession with control and perfectionism.

The abandoned warehouse on the city's outskirts seemed perfect. Isolated. Remote. Silent.

Sandra arrived precisely at 7:00 PM, her high heels clicking against the concrete floor. ""Where is everyone?"" she demanded, her voice echoing in the empty space.

The door clicked shut behind her.

""Your performance review begins now,"" Mark said, stepping from the shadows. But something in his voice was different. Colder. Calculated.

What happened next was beyond their wildest revenge fantasies. The screams that night were not what anyone expected—not Sandra's, but something... else.

When the police arrived days later, they found the warehouse empty. No trace of Sandra. No trace of her employees.

Just a single typed note on the dusty floor:

Here is a brief research I did with chat gpt on whether there are any profitable companies that have been delisted from the nasdaq and I share with you what I found:

Comparative Summary: MathStar, Luckin Coffee and SMCI.

 1. MathStar Inc.
- Context: Technology company focused on data processing, which faced financial viability issues.
- Missing catalysts:
  - Failed to hire a new CFO or take effective governance actions.
  - Failed to present a solid plan to maintain its Nasdaq listing.
  - Lacked significant support from large investors or insider buyouts.
  - Was never profitable; accumulated losses and faced constant financial difficulties.
- Result: It was delisted in 2008 after failing to meet the $1.00 minimum price required by the Nasdaq.

 2. Luckin Coffee
- Context: Chinese coffee shop chain that grew quickly and came to compete with Starbucks in China.
- Lacking catalysts:
  - There was no hiring of a new CFO prior to its delisting, although layoffs were made following the discovery of the fraud.
  - Failed to obtain a Nasdaq extension after it was discovered that it inflated its revenue by $300 million.
  - The statements of its auditors (EY) were negative after detecting irregularities.
  - Despite initial interest from large investors, buying sentiment dropped sharply after the scandal.
  - It reported growth, but was not really profitable, as its figures were falsified.
- Result: It was delisted in 2020 for financial fraud.

 3. Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) Context: Super Micro Computer Inc.
- Context: Profitable technology company and leader in high-performance servers, currently under review for regulatory concerns.
- Catalysts present:
  - Is in the process of hiring a new CFO to strengthen its governance.
  - Has filed for a Nasdaq extension and has received support from large investors.
  - Recent insider purchases reflect confidence in the company's future.
  - It is profitable, with robust revenues and no signs of fraud in its operations.
- Expected Outcome: SMCI is well positioned to avoid a delisting, depending on its compliance with Nasdaq regulations.

 Conclusion
After analyzing these cases, it is clear that no examples have been found of profitable companies that have been delisted from the Nasdaq for reasons other than political, geopolitical problems or serious financial fraud. 

SMCI stands out for its strong financial position and leadership in its industry, which significantly differentiates it from companies such as MathStar or Luckin Coffee. This reinforces confidence that, if it maintains its governance and compliance efforts, it can avoid delisting and continue to grow in its market.

I also share with you other companies that i researched with chat gpt and the curious thing is that i could not find really profitable companies that have been delisted from the nasdaq other than for political or geopolitical problems.

1. China Mobile Ltd.:
   - Description: One of the largest telecommunications companies in China.
   - Reason for Delisting: In 2021, it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange due to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, related to national security concerns.
2. US Airways:
   - Description: An American airline that operated domestic and international flights.
   - Reason for Delisting: It was delisted in 2004 after declaring bankruptcy for the second time. Subsequently, it merged with American Airlines.

   - Reason for Delisting: In 2013, it was delisted following a leveraged buyout that made it a private company. In 2018, it returned to public trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
4. Burger King:
   - Description: A multinational fast-food chain specializing in hamburgers.

Finally after a year of searching for someone to take my insurance or be cheap enough for me to be able to afford assessment, I found a therapist who is a Certified Autism Specialist, who offered me a discount with her sliding scale fee due to being on disability (for anxiety). With the discount and a little financial help from a good friend I am able to just barely afford to get the testing covered, then came the doubts. The paperwork she gave me was extensive asking about everything from 3rd grade academics to how my mother's pregnancy was with me. This is were the doubt set in, I know autism is a developmental disorder but I feel like I wasn't that bad as a kid. I got good enough grades and didnt really struggle that much once i got to later elementary school. Sure i was an awkward kid who was unable to really make any friends but some of the questions the ask in the extensive history just dont ring true to me for all and im nervous that Ive convinced myself of the possibility of having autism without really understand the nitty gritty of what that entails. I can do things like understand sarcasm okay I guess and while I do pace around and rub the top of my pants (to stim?) its not like I go insane when I dont do it.  Regardless I'm talking with my dad tomorrow to try to fill out the developmental history and see if theres anything there I was unaware of. I also have an anxiety disorder (can you tell?) so I'm worried I'm mistaking my anxiety symptoms and traits for autism. I do prefer being alone and I can't stand being around people because I feel vulnerable in social situation and don't really understand how to be social when not online. Being autistic would explain a lot about my life, trouble fitting in, being disinterested in activities most people enjoy (coffee, sex, sports, socializing), and my intense interests in things like video games and neuroscience. I'm just having doubts that I'm about to waste a lot of money for the therapist just to tell me I dont have autism even the slightest bit....",2,1733279451.0,AutismTranslated,0,0.75,False

the screenshot was taken when i sent you money so you can buy yourself a cup of coffee and a slice of cake from my favorite coffee shop, as my surprise treat to you for surviving your monster boss throughout the week.

instead, you bought a locally made milk tea and  shawarma, which were cheaper than what i wanted for you to have and paid for. but hey, as long as you’re happy.

then you sent me pictures of different kinds of dog treats and canned dog food in a paper bag. ibinili mo pala yung sukli ng pasalubong para kay teptep. sinabi mo pa na dapat ako ang nag-aabot nun  sa kanya para lumambing naman sakin. 

by the end of the day, you surprised me too by coming home to my apartment - even though it was 2 hrs travel time away from yours - and bought me my favorite shawarma, galing din sa sukli ng isinend kong pera sayo. 

i swear. that was the second time in my life i talked to God about how i want my babies to have you as their dad. i was so sure. yours were  the arms i wanted to be inside of after a long day at work.

On Sundays, you’ll usually find me glued to the couch watching NFL football, but it’s a bit lonely yelling at the TV solo. It’d be nice to have someone to share the wins, losses, and questionable play calls with.

It was lovely - open plan, not too quiet, supervised and it had a café. Whilst there, loads of Saudi students also sat there, and through cultural days and generally just being there etc I got to know many of them. I loved it. It was a tough time in my life but asking all of these people about their country, culture, language etc really made me happy. At Saudi events, I took many women's numbers and they all said ""we should go for coffee"" but being a non-Saudi, it's always me bumping into them and buying them coffee then and there. When they see me in the city, they say ""hello"", smile and go in groups. I also see them drinking coffee without me even though they literally invite me as part of their group. 
Recently, one girl invited me to her house for coffee, asked me about certain guys she knew which I didn't know much about and then never spoke to me again. She cooked me pasta and put it in an underwear and other shop bag for me to carry home which was mortifying. I got in the lift with her the other day and she pretended not to know me. 
My head is fudged. I've been promoting Saudi culture and Vision 2030 but I realised recently that a lot of Saudi people who claim to be my friends are not. It's embarrassing.

1h653w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1h653w6/is_this_legal_work_considering_moving_me_instead/,Is this legal? Work considering moving me instead of removing product. (England law),"Hello! I’m new to the UK and have been working at chain coffee shop in town. We recently released our Christmas drinks and three of them contain a topping in which I am highly allergic to. That being said the first week it was released (when I had my first shift using said topping on the 11th of November) I had on protective clothing (long sleeve shirt), ensured I had my epi pen readily accessible, changed my gloves every hour, washed my hands every hour, and took antihistamines (four 120mg ones). Yet when I arrived home I went into anaphylaxis. Had my epi pen administered by my flatmate and an ambulance was called. The topping was promptly removed. 

The following week I was on holiday in my home country (18th to the 23rd of November) and during this time it was decided that the topping would return. Four boxes of kn-95 masks were purchased for when I returned the next week. 

When I returned for my first shift following my holiday (the 25th of November) I began to wear/ do what I listen above in addition to wearing the provided kn-95 masks. I also will mention that I had to purchase my own personal pack of disposable gloves. I mostly worked on the floor clearing tables, washing dishes, cleaning toilets, and sweeping. This continued as a trend during my shifts. I took my prescription antihistamines and only encountered an itchy face every once in a while. 

Then on my last shift of that week on the 1st of December I was put on the bar to serve customers and make drinks. Everything was going well I only experienced minimal discomfort ie itching. So due to this I stepped off bar for a moment and had a coworker cover my till so that I could take my antihistamines. When I arrived back to my till my coworker ensured everything had been properly whipped down. I then began to serve customers again. About 2 minutes later the itching intensified this caused me to use my right pinky finger to itch the inner part of my eye. This was my fault and mistake. After itching my eye 2 minutes later I began to struggle to breathe. The itching became a patchy red rash throughout my body and my lips and throat began to swell. 

I promptly left bar and went to our break room and tried to calm down but I was unfortunately in full anaphylaxis. A call was made and a coworker arrived and administered my epi pen. The ambulance was then called as is protocol and I was taken to a&e. 

Now the legal issue at hand that I would like to inquire about. 

After this incident my regional manager was contacted and they then proceeded to have a meeting with their boss. It was decided that instead of removing the topping which is a very common allergen that could also affect customers that I would instead be moved to a smaller store location that’s farther for me to get to, where I would work the same hours alone and that is in an unfamiliar area to me. At this new location the topping that I am allergic to would not be served and I then would return to my main store after the Christmas drinks are done for the season. I suffer from anxiety and ADHD and am currently on the waiting list for an autism assessment. This would completely disrupt my routine and would leave my main store short staffed as I work full time and they would not get a replacement for me. 

I am unsure of uk (England) law on discrimination but feel as though this could potentially be as well as possibly show a lack of the ability to have reasonable accommodations or adjustments. Would this be worth getting a union involved or potentially seeking out legal advice/ assistance? 

I have worked here for 9 months and I am employed in England. If anyone has questions please ask and if anyone has advice please don’t hesitate to comment. Thank you! ",1,1733278380.0,LegalAdviceUK,4,0.57,False

I kill the boss, I reject the quest, I repeat. I’ve killed him about eight times now.

I want to be so so so so clear, and I’m sorry about this, but this method of farming him is not whatsoever for any sort of a new player. Every single legendary perk I use is maxed out and my build requires a lot of investment. 

Just to share some information about my set up, I use a Nerd Rage level low health, Crit focused Vats Heavy gunner build buffed to the heavens with food, chems, magazines and bobbleheads. Better criticals, Lucky 3rd star, 6 Luck food, 13 luck special and maxxed legendary Luck are required for a crit every other shot. 

All of my legendary perk cards are stats, and they are maxed, besides maxed out electric absorption to take advantage of his energy damage.

My armor is power armor with emergency protocols, full troubleshooter’s, full Hardy (7% less explosion damage per mod, for all his missiles), and last star is just weapon weight reduction because this is an old set and I haven’t been able to optimize it yet.

I am using a Vamp/Explosive/LUCKY Gatling Plasma in VATS targeting his Shield generator thingy with about 10 coffee every 20 seconds. It only takes 2-3 Salvos to break his shield this way and start damaging him proper. 

I chug 10 more coffee and switch to a Bloodied/Explosive/LUCKY Gauss Minigun once his shield is down, single Barrel so the coffee can keep up with the fire rate, might try Penta later though. By this point you should know the raid mechanics. I get into the door, come out once he’s done exploding everywhere and rinse and repeat. 

With this method I am able to kill him before the third door even opens, so this takes about 5 to 6 minutes each time.

I’m able to farm him comfortably like this, but it is resource intensive because of the coffee. Not to mention I have to use an astoundingly awesome magazine to reduce his robot damage even further by an additional 25% on top of my already robot resistant armor.

If you need me to be more specific let me know, but by this point I should really only be talking to veterans of the game who have an idea of my references because this is definitely not for newbies.

Good luck out there Wastelanders. This is rough, but I’m having a blast. I hope you all are too.

Edit: So far, 12 kills in, on this stage I have received a loose box mod 4 star (Electrician’s), and 3x 4 star Vulcan Power armor pieces. I have gotten a full Vulcan power armor set this way, but the other pieces are not 4 star. I have also received the Valkyrie, a 4 star unique Gatling Laser. 

Honorable mentions: a buncha 3 star and lower loose mod boxes.

or cumberbuns, on arrogant dudes, 


self awareness is a healthier pursuit  

your incompeteance gave me a confidence boost,

maybe im wrong, were you falsely accused?

you played that song on loop, for so long, 
it got long in the tooth, 
long before you got the boot

not an excuse, a review - of obvious truths..

you can always choose to not be a goose, 

wait til the lady says shes down to fuck too!

don't fuck around, in the town of timbuktoo


use whatever it takes to get lucky, for fucks sake

besides cable restraints or ducttape, thats just rape…

big girls don't play pattycake,

I don't give a fuck what money, daddy makes,

im into fatty cakes but

i shed deadweight like dropped pudding, 
if that's what it takes..

to ween you off baby food, 

swap baby blues for hot babes with boobs

it's time you grew up, kid,
go jump in a mosh pit, 
maybe you won't come across, 
quite so ..off-putting

What can I get them that will still feel ""personal""? ","Hi all, I'm struggling to think of a good X-Mas gift for my BFF (he's 27M; enjoys gaming, puzzles, action/sci-fi media, dogs, etc). 

The issue is that my bff is basically an arts & crafts savant. He's excellent at painting, sculpting, woodworking, etc. He's a really talented guy and he's always making me super high-effort and creative gifts. 

I, on the other hand, can't even draw a semi-identifiable picture of a dog. I've always been very artistically inept, and it's NOT for lack of trying. I've attempted some homemade gifts that took days, sometimes weeks to complete. They always turn out mediocre (or just plain embarrassing) and I've never seen a friend actually use one of them...

I've surrendered to the idea that homemade presents are simply my foil. So, I'd love some ideas within either of these two categories: 

1) Foolproof/beginner-friendly arts & crafts activities that make good gifts (aka something homemade that is almost impossible to screw up)

2) Something NOT homemade that still feels creative and personal (e.g. something beyond a simple coffee mug or t-shirt).

A lot of friends are suggesting I should get an air since it’ll be more portable and since I don’t NEED the pro.

But juust last month, things started goin downhill. it’s hard to even pinpoint when it started, but I felt this shift. he got a new job earlier this year, and I was super proud of him at first. then this one coworker came into the picture, and everything changed. I found some msgs from her not like super flirty or anything crazy, but idk, they felt off. She’d text him early mornings like, “don’t forget ur lunch!” or “we should grab coffee b4 work!” stuff like that. she’d even call him sometimes, when were spending time together he was soo busy with his phone, asking him who was that and he said just a co-worker coz she has a prob. and also I’d hear her voice in the background when he was gettin ready for work. it just rubbed me wrong then I noticed they’d always take their breaks 2gether. like, EVERY break. and when I asked about it, he brushed it off like I was overreacting. he’d say, “she’s just a friend, u don’t have to make it weird,” but it didn’t sit right with me. I couldn’t shake this gut feeling that something wasn’t right. & yeah, I started pickin fights bcoz I couldn’t stop thinkin bout it. It got bad. I’d overthink every little thing he did, if he got home late, I’d assume the worst. if he didn’t answer my texts fast enough, I’d start spiraling.

But no worries—your mousepad can handle it! A little cleaning here and there will keep it as fresh as the day you unboxed it. So, roll up those sleeves, grab some soap, and let’s give that pad a spa day it deserves.

**The Hand Wash Method: Show Your Mousepad Some Love**  
Start by filling a bowl or tub with cold water. Dunk that mousepad in and give it a little soak. Next up, add a bit of soap and go to town with a soft-bristle brush—nothing too harsh! Rinse it under cold water until every last sud is gone, front and back. Then, pat it dry with a towel, and let it air dry. Your mousepad’s ready to hit the battlefield again in no time!

**Can I Machine Wash My Mousepad? Sure… But Read This First**  
Yes, you *can* throw it in the washing machine, but hear us out: hand washing is the way to go if you want those vibrant colors to last. It’s like washing your favorite graphic tee—keep it gentle, and it’ll look good longer. But if you’re in a pinch, go ahead and machine wash it on cold with a mild detergent. Just skip the dryer unless you’re into “warp-speed” mousepads!

**Quick Fix for Stains: The Damp Cloth Trick**  
Spills happen—maybe you got a bit too hyped. For fresh spills, a quick wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes. Dab away those coffee or soda drops before they turn your pad into a sticky mess. If things get serious, just follow our wash steps for a full refresh.

**Special Care for Stitched and RGB-Edged Pads**  
If you’ve got stitched edges, give them a regular wipe-down to keep sweat and grime from settling in. For those rocking the RGB life, most people recommend unplugging, wiping it down gently, and letting it air dry before you replug. Trust us—your RGB will thank you with a brighter glow!

**Routine Check-Up: Keep It Fresh with Minimal Effort**  
Like your favorite gaming gear, a little routine care goes a long way. Aim for a quick wipe-down weekly, especially if you’re gaming hard. Sweat, snacks, and late-night drinks may leave their mark, but a little TLC keeps your mousepad looking like new.

**Time for an Upgrade?**  
Sometimes, it’s just time to start fresh. If your mousepad’s been through countless campaigns, maybe it’s ready to retire to “backup” status.

Always took me out and bought me fancy presents and treated me like a queen.

I understand there’s a lot I do that pisses him off but I’m so tired of his rage outbursts and being cursed at and called names. I just feel like I’m mentally about to fall apart.

Short Devotional about Kindness

Introduction
------------

Imagine the warm glow of a single candle in a dark room. Just as one tiny flame drives away shadows, one act of kindness can illuminate a heart and transform a day. Kindness is powerful. It is a gentle force that strengthens relationships, fosters community, and inspires hope in a world that can often seem unforgiving.

As we delve into our short devotional on kindness, we invite you to discover how small, intentional acts can lead to remarkable spiritual growth. The beauty of kindness is its simplicity—an open heart and a willingness to serve. Join us as we explore the importance of being intentionally kind and how it can enrich your life and the lives of those around you.

Bible Verse
-----------

Ephesians 4:32 (NIV): “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.”

Meaning
-------

Ephesians 4:32 is a clarion call to embrace kindness and compassion as foundational principles in our daily interactions. This verse gently nudges us to mirror the boundless love and forgiveness bestowed upon us by Christ. His example shows us that kindness is not merely an option but a fundamental way of life for those walking the path of faith.

Kindness transcends mere niceties; it embodies the essence of love in action. It is about seeing others as Christ sees them, with empathy and understanding. This verse reminds us that forgiving one another is not just about letting go of grievances but is an act of kindness in itself. We are encouraged to embody this selfless attribute that reflects God’s grace in our lives.

Through intentional kindness, we become instruments of peace. This behavior fuels relationships and strengthens our bond with others. Embracing kindness ensures that we act not from obligation but from the pure desire to see others thrive and feel valued.

The beauty of kindness is that its seeds never fall on barren soil. Every act of compassion and forgiveness enriches the giver as much as the receiver, bringing us closer to the heart of God.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Each day, write down three acts of kindness you can do for others and commit to completing them.

– Practice active listening in your conversations, showing genuine interest and empathy.

– Offer forgiveness to someone you’ve held a grudge against and make amends if possible.

– Share words of encouragement with at least one person daily, uplifting their spirit.

– Volunteer your time or resources to a cause that resonates with your values, spreading kindness to those in need.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– Reflect on a time when someone showed you kindness. How did it impact you, and what did you learn about its power?

– How can you cultivate a spirit of forgiveness in your life to accompany your acts of kindness?

– Write about a person in your life who exemplifies kindness. What attributes do they possess, and how can you incorporate them into your life?

– Consider an area in your life where you struggle to be kind. What steps can you take to improve?

– How does showing kindness to others deepen your relationship with God?

Prayer
------

Heavenly Father, thank You for the kindness and love You generously pour into my life. Help me to reflect Your compassion to others and to forgive as You so graciously forgive me. May my heart be a vessel of Your love, open and ready to serve those around me. Strengthen me with Your Spirit so that I may continually choose kindness, even when it feels difficult. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

A3: You can practice kindness by being a good listener, offering help when needed, showing appreciation, being patient, and spreading positivity. Small gestures, like smiling at a stranger or complimenting someone, can also make a big difference.

**Q4: Can kindness have an impact on mental health?**  
A4: Yes, kindness can significantly improve mental health. Performing and receiving acts of kindness can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It also releases feel-good hormones like serotonin and oxytocin, enhancing overall psychological well-being.

**Q5: How can teaching kindness benefit children?**  
A5: Teaching kindness to children can promote empathy, self-esteem, and social skills. It helps them build better relationships and learn the importance of community and cooperation. Kindness taught at a young age can lead to adulthood characterized by compassion and understanding.

**Q6: What are some examples of random acts of kindness?**  
A6: Examples of random acts of kindness include paying for someone’s coffee, leaving a kind note for a coworker, helping a neighbor with groceries, volunteering at a local charity, or simply holding the door open for someone.

**Q7: How can we encourage kindness in the workplace?**  
A7: Encouraging kindness in the workplace can be done by fostering an inclusive culture, recognizing and rewarding acts of kindness, providing opportunities for teamwork and collaboration, and leading by example. Creating an environment where everyone feels valued and respected is key.

**Q8: Can kindness be mistaken for weakness?**  
A8: While some might perceive kindness as weakness, it is actually a strength. Kindness requires courage and resilience, especially in challenging situations. It is a conscious choice to respond with empathy and support rather than negativity or indifference.

Feel free to use these questions and answers as a starting point for discussions or presentations about the value and impact of kindness!

1h64hfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1h64hfc/how_to_set_boundaries_with_a_pac_who_pushes/,How to set boundaries with a PA-C who pushes functional medicine for my Crohn’s?,"I work with a PA-C for my ADHD and every session they want to talk about my Crohn's Disease. I guess they're into functional medicine and have been trying to get me into functional medicine to help manage persistent symptoms despite being in remission. I don't know how to tell them I'm not interested in this path without sounding like a jerk because aside from this one thing, I don't mind working with them. I get what I need which is ADHD management and medication. 

Sometimes though, they hint that diet and environment and unconventional paths could reverse my Crohn's and to be honest, I find it offensive. They've mentioned a few times about ""getting to the root cause"" of the issue, like a specific food intolerance or mold exposure could be what is causing the disease. 

To be clear, they've never said not to continue with my current treatment plan but that adding functional medicine on top of my current treatment could be beneficial. Last session, I told them I sometimes feel frustrated when talking about my disease with people outside of my primary or GI because often I get unsolicited and incorrect advice and opinions. I also explained that before my diagnosis I tried so many things to fix the issues I was having, (had no idea I had Crohn's) but I only got worse and worse. 

Things I tried for years prior to diagnosis include:

* Elimination diets: No coffee, no soda, no beans, no soy, no gluten, no dairy, no artificial sweeteners
* Low fodmap
* Fiber supplements
* Pro and prebiotics
* Veganism for 7 years
* Juice Plus pills and shakes
* Tinctures
* CBD, THC,
* Meditation and acupuncture

The only thing that got me into remission was Remicade, which I started only a few months after my diagnosis.

Then, just today they suggested I look up this doctor of functional medicine who claims she reversed her Crohn's Disease. Maybe I just don't know enough about functional medicine and am reacting incorrectly but regardless, I still don't want to talk about my disease with them or alternative/additional treatments for it. 

I'm not necessarily a push over but really don't like confrontation. Looking for advice on how to go about having a discussion with them and setting a boundary. Could be I just need to find a new provider but appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance. ",5,1733276534.0,CrohnsDisease,10,0.86,False

I wanna explain the “ psych ward milk” piece i recently painted Cos it comes with a story! lol and here that story is : 

🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛
One time in the psych ward…

Well - I always hated milk n in the wards I’ve been to they give
U a milk and Juice cup w/ each meal and that’s it for liquids (decaf coffee at night with a snack too)

So.. I hate milk lol and refused to drink it. & I was so far into my psychosis I didn’t even notice a drinking fountain for the patients in the day room. 

So idk how many days passed where I wasn’t drinking fluids cos I hate milk, n maybe drank some juice cups, and didn’t even notice the drinking fountain 

This was in 2010-2013 (those years blur for me) I vividly recall my heart beat waking me up. 
It was loud and thumped and woke me up from a seroquel daze. I never felt like
This in my life 

I stumbled to the first person I could find, drugged up and in a daze, dizzy and faint & I told her 

“I think I am having a heart attack.”

They got me to a paramedic who took my vitals and established I was dehydrated 

From the ward, they took me in an ambulance to the ER at 4 in the morning to hook me up to an IV of fluids
I was beyond scared, paranoid and didn’t understand what was going on (psychosis from trauma) 
The worker from the ward tho rode w/ me and I asked him to hold my hand- so for the next hour or so i sat there confused and scared crying and in pain holding a strangers hand thinking I was gonna die 
ALL BECAUSE I HATE MILK

Anyway ..they get me back to the ward n show me The water fountain, give me a cup and direct me to hydrate 

Idk how tf they expect mentally ill people
In an asylum to have any awareness at all when I hadn’t even showered at this point for weeks and when I was admitted I was ‘catatonic’ staring at a ceiling not blinking

I am the owner of a 7 year old Boston Terrier. He’s a great dog, very energetic for his age but is a picky eater. When I say picky, I mean it. I have owned a lot of BT’s over time and this one turns his nose up at everything. With that being said I am on the hunt for a new dog food. 

I currently feed him the Farmers Dog and he gets Lotus chicken kibble (has grains) but recently I’m noticing he doesn’t care for the Farmers Dog much.

I am looking to switch him to a different kibble and soft food that I can mix into his kibble. 

I am thinking of switching to Purina Pro Plan or Hills and using one of their sensitive formulas. He’s very itchy all the time and tends to scratch his back using the underside of the coffee table (no red skin or biting of the feet, just rubs his back a lot)

I’ve also been giving him baths about once a month in a skin calming shampoo to help as well.

I mean we are in a long distance for 4y now. I’m just asking for communication. He never explains or sais anything. He didn’t seem fazed about breaking up either. He later said he does have feelings for me but was showing how serious he means it. Isn’t that kinda cruel?

 I was a complete mess, I’ve cried all night and day and now I just feel numb. This is the third time he has pulled the rug. I think that he is bored but we never do anything else than game. He is the type that always has to be entertained. I’m not a bad gf, I’m loyal, I give affection, I’m kinky, I let him know he’s loved, I get him coffee or whatnot every other weekend, meds if he’s sick, I’ve helped out a lot, his family loves me. I’m the only one who’s travelled over, he hasn’t even gotten a passport. He spends his money on games, tv, consoles or screens. Then he gets mad at me for not saving money, or if he has to go work but I got the day off, how is that fair? my work situation and how I do it has nothing to do with him tbf. 

I just don’t get it if it’s immaturity or. I just feel like how can I be invested 100% if he isn’t. I can’t do everything on my own. He just wants to do whatever he wants with no regards to anyone. I get complained on constantly. Now I’m wondering why I’m even here. I don’t feel loved nor beautiful and my trust has decreased if he now just can pull the rug like that with no second thought. I got bad anxiety over everything, I can’t eat, my stomach hurts. 

We got good memories aswell ofc, we are both gamers. Lately I get yelled at a lot tho. He sais I’ve changed, but doesn’t think that the way he treats me has changed. It has tho, if I get love and care and don’t need to worry I’m usually a happy bundle of joy. Not this hot, cold, hot, cold treatment. I’m apparently giving him stress if I need basic affection or us time. (We usually in a party group chat with other ppl) When I get yelled at I feel I do worse. I feel like if I put even a tiny bit of pressure on, he can’t take it. 

I defend myself a lot, I have to. He just sais I never listen and “argue” against him all the time. How can I not when a lot is inaccurate and mostly negative about situations or me. What I want or need is never on the table, it’s always about him. I mean I’m not perfect but I do the best I can. I dunno what to do, like I love him a lot and that’s the problem. Or perhaps I’m in love with the memories more now. Should I just give up? I’ve put so much into this relationship but now I feel hesitant. I’m not the type to give up, that’s I guess also a problem :( sigh, I’m just scared I’m wasting my years. Is a person who acts like this really in love?

1h63wsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1h63wsq/lpr_acid_reflux_gerd_inflammation/,"LPR, Acid Reflux Gerd, Inflammation...","Hello Everyone,

PLEASE BEAR WITH ME! As this has been somewhat of a lengthy journey for me and wanted to divulge as much of my experience as feasible. I'm not a doctor or a professional in the field, but find that subreddit dialoguing has boasted more value to me than any doctor I've experienced for my issues over the last few years.

My Story --   
After suffering from LPR / Acid Reflux Symptoms for a few years now (since maybe 2020/2021 & Off + On since) I wanted to take some time to jot down my experience with the symptoms I've had and the varying paths I've gone down to finally see a shimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.

Some years ago I started noticing a shift in my health when I started feeling a lot of abnormal tense feelings in my stomach, globus sensation, throat clearing, clogged ears, post nasal drip. The best way I can describe it is this gnawing, wind knocked out of you, pressure sensation in the gut of my stomach. I noticed it the most when I laid down on my back. somedays I found myself curling in a ball like a child on my side.  
So naturally after awhile of losing patience and my mind with googling symptoms and feeling scared over the information I was reading that only frightened me more then anything -- I finally decided to make a call to a gastroenterologist. (Top doctor, at a top hospital facility in Boston)

\- We tried breath tests to rule out H Pylori + overgrowth as well as another hydrogen test to rule out an intolerance to sugar (Results: Both Negative). The recommendation coming out of this appt was a Multi page pamphlet for FODMAP dieting. No day to day instructions, just a simple black and white photocopy of a diagram showing what to eat vs what not to eat.

I banged my head against the wall for the better part of the next 6 months trying to make sense of the information the doctor provided and how I was to strategeticlly plan out a Path that  would help me to get to the root cause of my issue WHICH AT THIS POINT I still wasn't even sure if food was the issue. So I travelled down this road blind, eliminating my diet to something bland and feeling my personality and character slip into this weird abyss of scarily obsessing over my meals and what to eat every time I got hungry.

At this point I felt utterly helpless and lonely.

\- Next Steps: Gastro recommended that If I wanted to rule out anything major -- to add in an endoscopy as it rules out many things all at once - so we made the appt, got the procedure done and I was immediately tapped on the shoulder upon waking up from anesthesia ""Your A OK kiddo"".

Unfortunately when you're feeling any type of pain and you're consistently being told YOU'RE FINE -- the news can be deflating as you constantly feel like you're going back to the drawing board.

Side Note: When I was in the resting / prep room waiting for the anesthesiologist to come in to go over the appointment and medication administration waiver of sorts -- I said to him jokingly ""I have this odd feeling so much of this gnawing stomach pain + anxiety feeling I've been having nonstop is related to smoking weed or something"" HA HA  
And his response was something to affect of ""I wouldn't be surprised, more patients your age and younger are coming in for this procedure which isn't the norm considering most people that get an endoscopy are for much older patients with health issues""

I shrugged the conversation off and moved on. Why would all this anguish be resolved with such an obvious solution, like stopping smoking MJ?

Time went on and I had a series of days around Thanksgiving in 2022 where I was finding it hard to breathe.

I couldn't draw a lot of breath in and felt this globes sensation so tightly in my throat that I panicked and had my husband shuffle me over to the ER. At this point I felt like I was reaching a critical point and needed serious assistance.

\- The ER that I went to said AFTER taking me into the appointment that they didn't have the proper equipment to do ultra sounds or scanning so they were essentially sending me out the door shrugging their shoulders and telling me to go elsewhere (What an easy way to make a dollar in this country, my goodness!) In parting I told them I haven't been able to refill my allergy nasal spray so without a thought, they asked what it was and wrote the prescription.

I took my medication sparingly (Off and On) and didn't think anything of it when I had good days and bad.  
Like, could this medication be the reason I'm having good days?? Who knows...

\- Next Step: I felt that the gastroenterologist was running me around the block with no real progression or direction. He very much has that ""USA / Pharmaceutical knows all"" mentality and doesn't lean into anything herbal / Alternative medicine wise. So I decided to pivot and try out an ENT.

During my visit they did a quick scope in the nose and down the throat (I forgot the terminology/procedure) And instantly upon searching told me I had LPR. AGAIN, she didn't give any instruction into what that means other then to heal your throat. Which is another form of completely dismissing what could actually be the root cause.  
This tends to be the nature of going to the doctors. They'll guide you somewhere and then leave you there with vague and/or masking solutions.

Come 2024 I started back up with feeling the globus sensation kicking in and found myself back online doing research and starting over.

I found a sub reddit on here weeks ago talking about how Allergy medicine was the root cause for their LPR  (And what I learned from this sub was that allergies can mimic the same symptoms like acid reflux + globus as you would straight forward LPR).

What I read after seeing the reddit and doing a google search:

""LPR (Laryngopharyngeal Reflux) and allergies can share similar symptoms because both conditions can cause inflammation in the throat and nasal passages, leading to symptoms like a scratchy throat, postnasal drip, cough, and mucus production, making it difficult to distinguish between the two without proper diagnosis; however, key differences exist, such as the trigger (food for LPR, allergens for allergies) and the nature of mucus produced, with LPR often causing thicker mucus compared to the watery mucus from allergies.""

I also saw another sub where another conversation being had was about how stress was causing their LPR.

Long story short, this got me thinking about all the ways I could help myself to destress (even though I didn't FEEL necessarily like I was stressed), but decided to at least go down a more alternative medicine approach to getting relief and so I decided to kick start this journey with slowing down facets of my everyday, eating even cleaner then before (removing so obvious acid triggers - onions, garlic, coffee, no smoking weed at all) and decided to order up Magnesium Threonate + Magnesium Glycinate (Recommendations I took from a nutritionist)

And I kid you not, within maybe 24-48 hours of taking both of these  supplements (Threonate in the AM, Glycinate in the PM).

I almost felt instantaneous relief the following day.

No No No - It can't be!!!! Why am I not feeling the globus sensation as I was so strongly the other day.

Even after I eat, why is my throat feeling relaxed and normal... why am I not feeling this deep internal pull of anxiety/tightening)

I felt SO UNBELIEVABLY GOOD the next few days I was having a hard time adjusting to this new feeling.  
Is it really the magnesium?  
or was it that I skipped Coffee today?  
After doing deep research into Magnesium and its affects - I read the the following passage and it clicked.

""Magnesium can potentially help relieve stress by calming the nervous system, regulating stress hormones like cortisol, and inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, essentially acting as a natural ""brake"" on the body's stress response; research suggests that a magnesium deficiency can contribute to increased anxiety and stress levels, making supplementation a potential option for managing stress symptoms.""

As always, it's important to stress that this resolution will not be the solution for all and my situation of feeling this instant relief has been about a week now. (FINGERS ARE CROSSED).

I've been a vegetarian since I was in 6th grade (I'm 39 y/o) And as you age and stress tends to creep in more -- there was never this thought of ""maybe I should get blood tests done and find a baseline for my nutrients and see where i'm deficient and what I should be working on in my diet/supplements/daily life.

A light bulb literally went off! I'm still in shock that all of this anguish could possibly be triggered by my body being stuck in ""fight or flight mode"" and balancing out my nutrients in addition to SLOWING DOWN in everything that I do in life could really be the answer.

1. When im on the highway, drive the speed limit, slow and steady (relax, everywhere I need to go is not that critical)
2. walk wherever I go (no fast pace walking or rushing)
3. At the grocery store, take my time.
4. Talking to people at home or at work -- calm, calm calm. No need to rush through what im trying to say.
5. Untimely removing myself from this pressure cooker sensation, like whatever I have to do today will be the end of the world.

Realizing that everything can wait and be done in a timely relaxed manner in addition to this new found MAGNESIUM support has been life altering / life changing for me and no amount of words will tell you how incredible I've felt this last week. I'm not the greatest writer, so excuse any grammatical errors and skimming of some of the chapters of my journey as its just more of the same.

In all of this babbling - I really hope that any of this information that you read can be of help or at least be another guiding light of support and direction to finding a resolution / cure to your pain.

This is my first relationship ever and I’m his first as well. We met in dance class 3 years ago, and still see each other there a few times a week.

He’s the first guy ever who I’ve genuinely had interest in. I struggle with social anxiety and don’t make friends easily, and have always been too scared to let myself get too close to a guy before. But he’s incredibly kind and gentle and easy to talk to. I always feel safe around him.

Two Fridays ago I went to watch him in The Nutcracker and met up with him afterwards outside the theater. He had this really serious look on his face, which is unusual for him because he’s always joking around. He looked in my eyes and told me he’s had feelings for me for over a year now, but was afraid I’d feel uncomfortable if he told me. He wasn’t totally sure I’d feel the same way and he didn’t want to ruin our friendship if things didn’t work out. But he finally decided he had to ask me out on a date because it’s been on his mind for so long.

I easily said yes and we planned a dinner date for last Tuesday. But 90 minutes before, he texted me a sincere apology saying he was feeling overwhelmed from work and asked if we could postpone. He wants to feel refreshed for our first date to give me his undivided attention, which I dearly appreciate, and I want him to feel healthy absolutely. He really has been working way too hard (3 jobs) and I don’t want him to overdo it.

Another week has gone by now and we still haven’t found a day that he’s free to meet me, even just for a quick coffee or ice cream date. He said he might have to wait until January to be free.

We’ve still been texting every day and having fun at dance, which I love, but since this is my first boyfriend ever I’m just not sure what’s normal and what to reasonably expect.

I read some other posts of people asking similar questions, saying their guy canceled their first date without rescheduling within a certain time frame, and almost everyone suggested dumping the guy because he seems disinterested. But all of those posts for the most part were about guys they weren’t close to already, like from online dating. In my case he’s my best guy friend (really my best friend) so I would never drop him without a second thought like that.

We’ve been together for 11 days now without a first date, and since I’m inexperienced (he is too) I’m just worried about us being off to a potentially rocky start, unless that’s actually a pretty normal amount of time without a first date if it’s someone you already know well?

Is there anything I can do to maybe help him with things from his perspective? Like if he’s really stressed from work, I’m concerned I might be making it worse by texting (I only message him once a day if that). But I also don’t want to ghost him in case he’s feeling in need of support.

I’m just really confused because 11 days ago he eagerly, carefully and thoughtfully initiated this whole thing, and was thrilled when I told him I’ve been secretly crushing on him too. But I’m worried something isn’t right. He means so much to me, and I’ve been pinching myself that my best friend and crush actually asked me out.

Any advice or reassurance would really be appreciated. ",1,1733274635.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

I’m going on my second VV cruise in January and it’s the Eastern Caribbean Antilles itinerary on the Scarlet Lady. My first cruise was the Dominican Daze itinerary on the Valiant Lady so I’m familiar with the shore thing offerings for Puerto Plata and Bimini. However, I’m wondering about the shore things for San Juan and St. Croix. I’m interested in the Caffeine and Cobblestones walking tour in San Juan and the Better Cocktail Better Planet Class in St. Croix. Has anyone ever done either of these and have feedback on them? Or does anyone have recommendations on other VV shore things to check out?

I used to host a Mothers Day Tea at my church on the day before Mothers day.  I  did this for about 15 years.  It was always a fancy affair and my gift to the ladies of the church.  I planned, cooked and hosted it.   Im not bragging when i say I am a pretty good cook, especially baking.   Every year  I hired  a singer for a 1 hour set,  decorated to my theme of the year,  had games and prizes.  I would make 4 - 5 savory dishes,  4 - 5 dessert dishes,  several kinds of tea,  punch and even coffee.  I paid for everything and did all the work myself.   

On this particular Mothers Day Tea,  my mother in law, (who thankfully lived about 4 hours away), was in town, so of course I invited her to the Tea.   On the day of the party,  I was quite busy.  We got to the church and 2 of the church ladies took my MIL and sat her with them, since she didnt know anyone but me.   As I said I was running around.  I MC'ed the event, so I led with a prayer, we played games,  voted on best hat, etc.   I also served the Tea,  going to from table to table to keep the tea pots full, kept the food dishes full.   It was a great day.

Afterwards, when we were cleaning up,  the 2 church ladies (love you Barb and Sandy, both now gone)  came up to me and they were Livid!  These were 2 of the sweetest ladies i knew.  The older of the two, said she never wanted to punch someone as much as she wanted to punch my MIL.  The other one said, dont ever invite her again.

What she had done they said,  was to roll her eyes every time i got on the stage and talked,  said the games were dumb, the prizes were lame and  when one of the church ladies said something to the effect of ""Isnt this such a nice party, Paraveous is such a good cook and everything tastes great, blah blah blah"".  

 MIL's  reply was "" She Tries"".

We were dating on and off for about a year and were together shy of a year we broke up a week before our 1 year.

The circumstances were he got too drunk and verbally aggressive and hitting things in the room and the argument ended the relationship. Prior to this we never argued and it was almost perfect.

It’s been 6 weeks and I’ve been trying to reach out ever since but he spent a lot of the time ignoring my existence completely 

When he eventually spoke we went for coffee and it was nice however he went back to ignoring my existence 

I asked if he’d ever want a relationship again he said no and that he wanted to be friends but didn’t want to speak to me at all 

The whole thing has made me feel like he dosent care, the relationship ended because of his behaviour which he hasent even yet took accountability for, he hasent tried to fix things, he’s totally disposed of me like I meant nothing, I blocked him now as it’s the only thing left I can do 

But I’m just struggling with it all, like how can someone go from loving you so much and then suddenly they disappear and make you feel like a burden for even trying to communicate with them and it’s not just our relationship it’s our prior friendship and years of memories, how is it so easy for him to forget me and everything we have shared",6,1733274224.0,AvoidantBreakUps,4,1.0,False

I’m desperate about endo and infertility.

26F I’ve always had normal periods and no symptoms of endo, except brown discharge day before and after my period. I also have family history of endo and I am from country that is in war with r*ssia, so severe anxiety and stress led three endometriomas to grow on my right ovary (3,5; 1,9; 1,5 cm).

My doctor also said I should be able to get pregnant, but 3 cycles ttc and no pregnancy unfortunately:( I’m on anti-inflammatory diet, tried to reduce stress level as possible and taken good sleep, cut out coffee, and still not pregnant, that is driving me mad! Funny thing is, I got rid of that brown discharge, but it never bothered me and it is the last thing I’m worried about lol

Tomorrow I’ll get AMH test, and next week I’ll have another ultrasound and appointment. I’m scared as hell endometriomas grew much bigger and affected my left ovary as well. I do not consider laparoscopic surgery as it will damage my ovaries dramatically, so I’m afraid to hear I need one otherwise I’ll stay infertile.

Are there any good stories among you on having endometriomas and falling pregnant naturally? Also, any good advice?",1,1733274126.0,endometriosis,4,1.0,False
1h63mq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h63mq7/im_related_to_a_wendigo/,I'm related to a Wendigo.,"Sorry if the title seems abrupt. After reading this, it'll make sense... I hope. 

You’ve heard this story a million times before. I’m a teenager who recently moved to Minnesota. So recently, in fact, I can barely remember the town’s name. Just search for generic towns on any search engine and I’m certain it’ll show up. I’m not going try avoiding exposition because I feel inclined to share this information with as many online strangers as I can. 

I moved into the town a month ago with my mom and dad. I lived in Virginia before, so adapting to Minnesota was not something I was thrilled about. I had to leave the few friends I had. My parents assured me that I would find people to hang out with. I didn’t really need any friends. I worked better alone. My parents let me bring my Xbox, but I believe they hoped I would leave it behind. Apparently, we moved here because my grandpa died. We are inheriting his fortune.

When I first left the car, I set my eyes on the house. No, my house. I had to live there. It was a shack if anything. It was a one-story house with faded log walls and a drywall interior. It had two bedrooms, a living room/kitchen, a bathroom, and an attic. My dad quickly monopolized the kitchen for his work. His laptop never left the island in the kitchen. My mom looked for a job around town. I explored the bleak house, hoping to find something fun.

“I’m bored.” I complained to my dad. He shrugged. “There’s plenty of things to do around here. Go shopping, go explore the woods. Find people to hang out with.”

“Wow, thanks for the help.” I said, masking the sarcasm in my voice. The look he gave me told me I wasn’t hiding it well. Maybe I didn’t want to. I expected Grandpa’s fortune to be grander, but what did I know? I never met him, at least when I was sentient.

My dad raised his hand and gestured towards his birthmark: two red splotches on the palm. “This mark means you’re a son of the Barkley family. If you embarrass yourself, you’re embarrassing your bloodline.” he insisted.

I rolled my eyes, being intentionally rebellious. “You’ve said that a million times. I don’t care anymore.”

“Just go somewhere, I have a call.” My father said, shooing me away like an animal. I grabbed my coat and went out the door. I walked down the sidewalk of the bustling town. The cars slowly drove past, their exhaust pipes producing fog in the cold, winter air. Everything foul here was fair in its own way. I guess their fumes propelled them towards their goal somehow. Unlike me, who was aimlessly walking until something interesting happened.

I stumbled on the icy sidewalk before grabbing on to a streetlight. I heard snickering behind me. I turned to see a group of three teenagers. “You new here?” one asked, pulling his beanie over his ears.

I nodded, nervously rubbing the outline of my birthmark on my left hand.

 “Well in that case… my name is James.” he held out his gloved hand. I shook it politely. He examined me closely, his freckles seemingly popping out of his pale face in the cold. “You really are new. I only assumed as much because you almost took a tumble there.” he gestured towards the ground.

“I’m not the most graceful.” I said. “Anyway, who’re the others with you?” I asked.

James turned to look at the other two teens. “This guy here is Kyle.” upon hearing his name, he gave me a flimsy wave. Kyle had messy blonde hair and was taller than the other two. He could pass for a surfer if he had a tan, which he didn’t.

The other person was a girl. She quickly introduced herself as Lucy. She had long, slightly curly hair, a wide face, and an expression I could only summarize as irritation. “Can we go now?” she asked James.

“Not yet, we got to welcome the guy. There ain’t many kids around here, remember?” he said.

Lucy scowled. “Our group is fine. We don’t need anyone else to hang out with.” She wrapped her scarf around her neck.

Kyle shrugged. “I don’t care what he does. Wait a minute, what’s your name, anyway?” he turned to me.

“My name is Drew. Andew, if you’re feeling brave.” I said jokingly.

“Alright, Andrew…” Lucy said, her voice dripping with venom, “We have to go now.”

What did I do to this woman? I didn’t understand. James gave me an apologetic look. “I guess we better be going.” James said.

“Wait, one more thing.” I interjected. He turned around and raised an eyebrow, waiting for me to elaborate.

“Where’s the candy store?” I asked. Kyle pointed to a store on the other side of the street as they left. They were a bit standoffish, but at least they weren’t pricks. I crossed the street, entered the candy store, and purchased an overpriced bag of nameless gummy worms. I left the store, pushing open the glass door as the bell rang. I wandered through the town, mapping every building as I got closer to the woods.

I reached the border between the town and the forest. The trees were bare, devoid of leaves. Even still, the forest seemed thick and unforgiving. I stepped into the woods and wandered aimlessly. The bitter winter air nipped at my nose and cheeks, making me regret not wearing a scarf.

“Hello.” A voice called out from the darkness. I perked up at the sudden voice. “Who’s there?” I asked, realizing too late that my voice was unsteady and nervous. Not a good first impression on my end.

“I don’t know who you are.” The voice said. I tilted my head, trying to get the unknown person to see my confusion.

“Where are you?” I asked the woods. The cold breeze stirred dead leaves past me.

“You are new.” It spoke once again. Its voice was mystical, as if blending with the wind. Maybe it was the wind, looking back. Even so, it spoke words I could understand.

I chewed on a sour gummy worm.

“I am hungry.” The wind said.

 I held out a gummy worm. “Do you want some of my food?” I asked. I don’t know why I even bothered talking to whatever it was. The voice paused, as if it was thinking.

A rattling sound echoed through the forest. Maybe it was a woodpecker.

“I’m starving…” its voice lowered, sounding raspy.

I tossed the bag of candy into the forest, wasting 13 dollars. “I gave you my food. Eat all you want.”

I heard loud footsteps crunching in the snow. *Tick tick. Clack clack.* Unknown sounds echoed through the forest. The footsteps came closer. A dog rushed past me from behind, barking into the woods. I looked down, startled slightly at the Labrador. It barked aggressively, its tail pointed upright. An older man rushed over to the dog, grabbing its collar. He turned to me.

“Sorry, kid.” he said. “Mabel gets loose too often, but I always know to find her here.” he chuckled. He went silent and turned to the forest. A bird called out from the woods. He grimaced. “Kid.” he turned to me. “Don’t go in there. Hunters could shoot you on accident, you could get lost, you could even drown in the lake. Stay very well away.”

I nodded. “What about the guy in the forest? Isn’t he in danger too?”

His expression grew concerned. “There’s nobody in there. The wind whistles through the thick branches. It sounds almost like voices.” he said. I felt like he didn’t believe in his own reasoning. He sighed. “You’re new here.” he observed.

I confirmed his statement. He cleared his throat, petting his dog’s yellow fur. “Listen up then. These woods aren’t safe, but…” his expression darkened. “It can, at times, be safer than the town.”

I insisted he elaborate. “The town has frequent famines. Food spoils and berries stop being as plentiful. We don’t get a lot of imports, either. When we get bad storms, we have to rely on stored, canned goods. It isn’t nearly as bad as it once was. Even if food is readily available, the danger is still there.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I’m saying that people abandon their humanity. They eat each other when everything dries up. There isn’t always a justification to it. People just… snap.”

I was at a loss for words. He sighed. “It isn’t like that anymore. We haven’t had an incident in five years.”

“So why warn me?” I asked.

He paused. “Because it isn’t going to stop. As long as it still breathes.” He muttered, looking at the forest.

“It?” I asked.

“It lives in the woods. It never bothered people physically, just cursed them in a way. Until a few months ago, that is. We’ve started to distance our kids from the forest where it lives.”

Mabel whimpered and dropped her tail low. I groaned. “What is it?” I said, getting impatient. I wasn’t willing to hear a vague campfire story.

“It’s a Wendigo. A beast of Indian… erm… native folklore. Do you know what they are?” he asked.

I nodded. “I’ve seen YouTube videos on them, even read a few books. You think a cryptid is out there?”

He stared into the forest. “Absolutely. They don’t believe me, but as long as one person believes, the Wendigo will be more cautious in its approach. You came here not long after the old man died. Why is that?” he asked me.

“If you’re referring to Clarence Barkley, he’s my grandfather.” I explained.

“My condolences.” the man said.

“No worries, I never knew him anyway.” I said reassuringly.

The trees creaked and branches snapped. A strong gust of wind blew past.

“Oh.” he said. “Good for you.”

“Was he an asshole?” I asked.

He shrugged. “He was entitled and snobby, as most rich people are. He was usually secluded, though.” The man explained. “He rarely came into town, and when he did, it was usually to buy meat. Lots of meat.”

Apparently, my grandfather was aloof. He stayed out of everyone’s way when he could. He wasn’t the nicest when people met him, though.

“So why did you ask why I came here?” I asked.

“Nobody ever comes here unless they have something to gain from it. I’m assuming you were claiming his will.”

“Yeah, that’s about it.” I said.

The man exhaled and watched the trees. “Do you know how to become a Wendigo?” he asked me.

“I haven’t really tried before.” I said sarcastically. “But I do know how they come to be.”

“Good. Try not to lose yourself. If you get hungry, eat whatever you can find. If you want more personal things, pray to God. Be happy with what you have.” The man said.

“I’m familiar with that stuff. I’m a good person- or I try to be.” I explained.

The man chuckled. “Just keep it in mind.”

Mabel tucked her tail between her legs and whimpered as she stared into the forest. The old man sighed. “Looks like I should head back.” He waved goodbye as he walked his dog home.

I went home after that. I entered the house, knocked off my boots, and peeled away at my winter gear until I was back into my casual attire. My father was busy on his computer, picking up work calls. He groaned. “God damn it. This is not the right time for a prank call!” he stormed off, dropping the phone on the table. I heard the bathroom door slam shut.

I crept over to the phone and held it to my ear curiously. On the other end was static. How was it a prank call? It could be an accidental dial. The phone suddenly picked up a new sound. It sounded like tv static, but it increased in volume slowly. After about 10 seconds, the sound was a deafening screech. I hung up the phone.

I decided to snoop around the house, looking for any stuff left behind. I wish we inherited the mansion, but the repair costs would double our debt. I blew the dust off of an old laptop someone left for some reason. It was even plugged in and fully charged. I turned on the laptop. Despite being a newer model, the laptop only had retro games. I decided to play Doom instead. If this computer belonged to my grandpa, he had good taste.

After 30 minutes of Doom, I played some sort of deer hunting game. It was 3D, but very primitive for a 3D game. The deer were basically advanced polygons. I aimed my cursor at a moving deer, causing it to activate a cutscene of the bullet traveling towards the deer. Before the bullet hit, the color of the screen inverted and crackled with a buzzing static. The deer’s peaceful black eyes glowed white, its face almost twisted into a sadistic smile. Of course, it was just a weird glitch. The deer’s antlers multiplied in size as the 3D model began to lose its form. The computer shut itself off.

I sighed and stuffed the laptop into a drawer. I was going to get it fixed eventually so I don’t have to buy any duplicate games on my Xbox.

Over the next few weeks, everything just got worse. The voice in the wilderness kept talking, although by now I had ignored it completely. Everything was fine until it said my name. I walked by the forest entrance to go to school and meet up with my friends and Lucy.

“Aaaaandreeeew.” the voice called out like a taunting child. I froze and turned to the forest. “How do you know my name?!” The words sat on the edge of my tongue. At the last moment, I held those words back. If I gave the thing any attention, I would surely regret it. The wind rattled the dead branches like some sort of bony windchime. The icy air felt like daggers on my skin.

I walked away, resuming my travels. “Aaandreeew…” it rasped. I ignored it.

“You’ve grown so much since the last time I saw you.” it said, clear as day.

I continued to walk away. It was just saying that to get my attention, whatever it was. This Wendigo has been a pain for quite some time. I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction. It went silent as I walked away. As I walked down the road, I noticed a dead deer on the curb. I walked around it, but a few minutes later, that task would be impossible.

The entire road was flooded with dead deer. Piles upon piles of corpses littered the streets, bleeding into the drainage systems. Even getting near the pile sent an overwhelming stench towards me. I vomited in the grass. The putrid odor rattled my systems and brought me to my knees. The corpses were suddenly dragged one by one into the bushes. My head pounded as I tried my best to get away. I felt a lanky, cold hand grab my ankle and drag me away slowly.

 I turned around to see white eyes staring at me from the bushes, concealed in the morning darkness. The extended bony arm tugged weakly. The silver eyes never left me. its translucent, pale skin crinkled with every movement, as if it was too tight for its own body. The faint outline of its humanoid face made me wish I was dead beforehand. I dug my nails into the concrete road, desperately trying to anchor myself. As I was dragged closer to the bushes, I could see its disgusting human teeth emerge from the shadows to devour me.

I used my free leg to kick the face of the hollow creature. It groaned in pain and released me. I made a mad dash for the school, stumbling over the corpses of deer. When I assumed I was safe, I turned around to see the largest deer in the pile being dismembered by the arms. The head was ripped off with a sound I could only compare to a tree snapping. That deer must’ve lived for at least a decade. Now, its elder antlers were being brandished by an imposter.

I made it to school, which probably wasn’t the best idea. I was so distracted by what just happened that it didn’t occur to me that I was covered in deer blood. The classroom shrieked in fear, dragging me out of my braindead state. I was brought into the counselor’s office for questioning. They didn’t believe my story until they looked out the window. Of course, I never mentioned the actual Wendigo. I just said that a herd of deer died, which wasn’t false, but not completely true either.

I was certain it was the Wendigo. It was starving and undoubtably bloodthirsty. It was also cold. Its touch was like the pole of a stop sign in winter.

They eventually gave me some temporary clothes and sent me on my way. In third period, an earsplitting scream rang from the forest. It sounded like a mix of a human, elk, and electronic static. It was impossibly loud, causing us to plug in headphones or cover our ears.

 The sound continued for the next week.

Our town adapted quickly. We learned some basic hand signals and got very good at understanding body language. The town became barren of all animals. Deer had migrated to a new area. Dogs fled to find safety, ending up in ditches or dumpsters. I found Mabel under my bed, which scared the hell out of me.

I was sitting on my couch when my mom motioned for me to take out my earbuds. I was greeted with the sound of silence. I almost teared up in joy. Authorities investigated the source of the sound with no success. They couldn’t even blame anything. The mayor eventually told the town not to worry about it. To no one’s surprise, everyone kept worrying about it.

I wandered through the cold town. I bought candy, as usual, and went on with my day. James, Kyle, and Lucy intercepted me. “Long time no see.” James said to me. “We thought it was you that was screamin’ all week.” he said jokingly.

“What do you want from me?” I said, realizing too late that it sounded rude and confrontational. Luckily, James didn’t pick up on the change of tone.  
“We wanna go exploring.” Kyle said.

“They want you to come with them. It wasn’t my idea.” Lucy said.

“…Thanks.” I said. “So where are we going?”

“We’re gonna go to the old mansion in the woods. It’ll be just like one of those old movies. You in?” James said excitedly.

Every instinct I had knew to decline his offer. No sane person would randomly wander into the woods. That’s not only dangerous, but stupid. “Sure, I’ll go.”

Lucy sighed, likely hoping I would decline. I’m not the best at understanding social cues, so I have no clue why this chick was so pissed at me. Maybe she had a crush on me. That would be cool.

“When are we going?” I asked.

“Now.” James answered quickly.

I didn’t bother asking if they had all the supplies. Lucy had a comically large backpack strapped onto her shoulders. Despite being shorter than all of us, she was the strongest by far. What a terrifying combination.

We made our way through the frozen forest. The only sound we heard was our footsteps. When we got closer to the manor, we occasionally heard disembodied voices conversing from somewhere in the woods.

“Are others here?” I asked nervously. It occurred to me that this was my grandfather’s house. At least, it was. It looked much better in the pictures. The windows weren’t boarded up back then.

“Those voices are always there.” Kyle said as we reached the front porch. We opened the door, which was strangely unlocked. At least it made me feel less uneasy about breaking into my grandfather’s house. When we entered the manor, I realized why my family had our own house. The mansion was run down, overwhelmed with cobwebs and deep scrapes in the wood. It looked as if a bear had been living here.

Lucy aimed the flashlight around, the bright light waving in the darkness. The light reflected off of a bleached deer skull with large antlers that had been mounted on the wall. We went up the stairs. The door to the bathroom was locked. Lucy slammed into the door, snapping it in half. We ducked under the broken door and stared into the bathtub. The entire tub was filled with decayed chicken bones and decomposed meat.

“Jeez, the old man was a glutton.” James remarked.

Bones were haphazardly thrown around the bathroom. We dug through the pile, looking for something of value. There was nothing. Kyle scoffed. “Maybe he took his money to the grave.”

“We aren’t digging him up, are we?” I asked.

“There’s no body.” James said. “Even his death is shrouded in mystery.” he said ominously, expecting a fearful reaction from one of us.

Kyle exhaled. “It isn’t as deep as you make it seem.”

Dead branches tapped against the window. The cold breeze made the house feel somewhat smaller. I couldn’t help but notice that the tree looked… off. It was like one of those insects that look like leaves. They look like a leaf, but they’re alive. We continued snooping around the rooms, splitting up along the way. I went back to the front door and began to close it, as we had left it open before.

The voice called out from the forest. “You heard my call.” It spoke. I closed the door. I chose to ignore it as usual. I was desensitized to it at this point. It hasn’t done much to me so far, so I doubt it could deal any real damage. It continued talking as I walked away from the door.

I snooped around for a bit longer. Nothing gathered my interest. For a mansion, it was absolutely disgusting. The door rattled as the wind beat against it. I should’ve known better then. Blaming things on the wind only got me so far.

From upstairs, I watched with bated breath as the doorknob clicked and opened. The room grew cold, and a draft embraced me. Snow glistened against the dusty carpet. The door creaked open completely. Standing on the porch was something I couldn’t begin to explain. It had two long, emaciated legs. It could be human, but the hooves denied my reasoning. Massive bony hands hung down from its body, its slender fingers twitching and clicking claws together. Multicolored fur coated most of the body in brutal patches, like a shaven dog. No, it was as if it put the fur on itself.

One hooved foot tapped against the floor as it began to step inside. As it crouched down, I could see its exposed ribcage hugging a sack of organs weakly inside it. Before I could view its visage, I backed away from the upstairs balcony and into a bedroom. I peeked behind the doorway, waiting for something to happen.

The long hand rose from under the balcony. It reached for the skull mounted on the wall. The skull disconnected and fell down into the large hands of the entity. After a brief period of silence, the antlers rose from behind the edge of the balcony. The two hands gripped onto the fence as the thing pulled its whole mass up. The skull was no decoration, it was a mask.

The deer skull looked as dead as ever. The eye sockets were empty except for a tiny silver light in each eye. The carpet near the thing froze. The thing’s eyes never left me as it stretched its hand closer to me. It was almost like the arm was extending according to the will of the lifeform. If you could even call it a lifeform.

I breathed heavily, fear washing over. My breath escaped my lips small clouds of warm steam. I was so concentrated on the Wendigo that I forgot I hadn’t come here alone. Kyle had appeared in the doorway, staring at the starving creature. It was so hungry; I just knew it. My primal instincts told me to feed it.

I extended my hand hesitantly. The Wendigo directed its clawed hand to me. My finger nudged the cold keratin as we connected. “Drew?” Kyle squeaked. I slowly turned to him. Kyle backed away from the balcony. The Wendigo pressed the side of its face against the fence, its mouth agape. I could see the humanoid mouth behind the deer skull dripping with saliva. Its silver eye peered at me. It panted and groaned, trying to inch closer to me.

“Drew, stop.” Kyle pleaded. I stared at him blankly. The Wendigo knocked over a coffee table, shattering some sort of glass object as it pressed itself against the upstairs balcony. A hand gripped my wrist and yanked me away. I turned to see Lucy scowling at me. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” she hissed. I hadn’t noticed her when I entered the room, so her startling me didn’t help my situation.

I explained to her that it felt natural, like putting your foot in a shoe or popping your back. It was instinctual. She looked at me like I was crazy. I couldn’t blame her. The Wendigo panted, its swollen bovine tongue hanging out the side of its mouth. Lucy squeezed my wrist harder, then let go. “Fine. Be difficult for everyone. I personally don’t care if you die or not.” She sighed. “But they do.”

I wasn’t sure what she meant. She noticed my confused expression. “You have friends, remember? They care about you, and since I care for them, I don’t want them to be grief-stricken. They already have me.” she frowned, realizing she said too much.

I heard the voice of James shout in fear. The Wendigo turned to see him; its inner mouth twisted into a frustrated grin. Its gums bled as the jaw squeezed shut. “Jesus.” James said in terror. The Wendigo thrust its clawed finger at where I believed James was. I heard a cough, groan, and thud as James collapsed. It dragged James’s corpse to the edge and picked it up. I heard the unmistakable sound of chewing, crunching, and ripping.

I knew it was safe. I stood up and walked out of my hiding place, down the stairs, past the feeding creature, and out into the cold forest. I averted my gaze from the thing as it ate. I could hear the swaying of its bushy, matted tail. My fear suddenly returned when I left the mansion. My friend was being devoured messily by a beast of folklore. It almost killed me, and I let it.

I heard a creak as Lucy and Kyle crept out of the building. The Wendigo gurgled and turned to face us. Its large body was barely illuminated in the dark mansion, yet the crimson blood was clearly visible pooling at its feet. The two looked up at me with a look of pure terror. They descended the porch stairs and stood behind me. The Wendigo stood up, its joints popping and cracking. A gurgle resonated deep in its maw as blood trickled out from its deer skull. Its fingers twitched with every movement. Paralyzed with fear, I could only stare as it made its way towards the front door. A picture frame fell from the wall and landed at the hoof of the starved creature.

The Wendigo looked down, its massive antlers scraping against the drywall. It looked down at the shattered glass. The bleached skull reflected in the shards. Its piercing eyes hovered over the printed image. I could not tell what it was, but the image seemed to provoke the entity. It groaned and slashed at the image, tearing it to shreds.

The towering, emaciated forest spirit tilted its head and squeezed through the door. Yellow wallpaper hung from its antlers like confetti, occasionally glistening in the stray beams of sun leaking through the clouds. It shuffled closer, its hooves clacking on the wooden porch. The porch creaked and groaned under the weight of the Wendigo.

It paused for a moment, its eyes scanning us curiously. It wobbled on its skinny legs and shuddered from the cold. My lips bled as they dried. We stood there for what felt like hours, waiting for the creature to do anything. We couldn’t run from it or fight it. However, it didn’t appear to want to kill us. Yet.

The head stopped turning, its gaze directed at me. Kyle and Lucy watched me, waiting for my reaction. Frozen tears had solidified against their faces.

“Why.” The Wendigo whispered, its mystical voice echoing like a divine spirit. I took a step back, startled. However, I remained silent. I wanted to know what it was about to say.

“Why do you… feel warm?” It spoke slowly, as if processing each word carefully before saying them.

“Warm?” I stuttered. The Wendigo’s fingers twitched involuntarily. It hunched over, peering at me.

“He was cold when I… recovered from him.” the Wendigo’s eyes darted towards the front door, now stained with blood. “But you… are warm.”

I tried unsuccessfully to stop myself from shaking uncontrollably. The Wendigo breathed heavily, each breath an arctic breeze. It thrust out a thin hand, slashing at me. Before my head was removed, the hand retracted, clutching onto its ribcage. Its long fingers grasped firmly on the chest, squeezing tightly. Startled, the Wendigo looked down at its arm.

“He is… resilient.” The famine spirit whispered. “Same as you.” it pointed to me, gently brushing my cheek with its claw. Something on its hand caught my eye. Right below the thumb close to the palm, it had two red splotches. Birthmarks. The same birthmarks I had.

It all made sense. My grandfather was greedy and self-centered. My parents didn’t like inviting him to family meetings. He had no interest in me. Still, I didn’t expect it to be that bad. The thing that has been pursuing me was my own grandfather.

The Wendigo stared me down. It squeezed its own neck until it collapsed. Lucy and Kyle backed away. “What…” they tried reasoning with themselves. As the Wendigo began to move once more, we ran back to town. A part of me wanted to stay and comfort what was once my grandfather, even if he was trash. I knew that it wouldn’t let me see my grandfather again.

Clarence Barkley lived his life alone. He accumulated a large amount of money and died alone. The Wendigo took advantage of his greed. Somehow, my grandfather fused with the forest spirit to become a functional entity. That’s my current theory, at least. The Wendigo was weak on its own, scrambling desperately to blend with the ecosystem as an autonomous lifeform. When it gained humanity, it yearned for more. For me.

It’s been a rough month. Every day I watch the forest, waiting to hear a whisper or scream. I wait for something to happen. The Wendigo has not appeared since. My friends haven’t showed up either, probably because I’m related to a Wendigo.",3,1733274114.0,nosleep,1,0.72,False

I 28M, met this wonderful 30F in an outing 2 weeks ago, I know im gonna sound a bit desperate here, we hit it off and we really bonded over drinks with mutual friends, we ended up sharing socials with each other, from there on we texted every day, sharing hobbies and really connecting, I invited her on coffee and she joiner (we were not alone as one of our mutual friends came along) i later learned that she had a boyfriend although apparently In a bad relationship. She then come out the other night again for drinks this time and we got drunk, and she wanted to be close as we were walking places she wanted me to hold her hand, and leaning into me.. and we got to talking.
She had told her boyfriend about me and he is obviously not very happy about it (as we were texting everyday), which I can understand he doesnt know me, and hes supicions are true im very into this girl/woman whatever you want to call her. So I did something stupid i told her bring her boyfriend next time.. so there he can see there is nothing to worry about. I even gave her advice on how to fix their relationship. 

Im honestly fucking lost right now, I feel like I should just text her and say that we cannot talk anymore and loose out on having one of the greatest friends of all time (we have that much in common). It feels weird crushing this hard on a girl i havent really known for long. And I dont want to be the reason she breaks up with someone.

Please give me some information how I should deal with this situation.",1,1733274098.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1h63kvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1h63kvj/es520s_not_warming_up_on_the_frother_side/,ES520s not warming up on the 'frother side',"I have a pretty old EN520S which worked great for a long time but now has an issue. The 'Cappuccino' buttons (in red) keep blinking together for a long time and the machine turns itself off. These buttons are supposed to blink while warming up, and once the desired milk warming temp is reached, they are supposed to turn solid. So, I am guessing that some heating element is messed up inside (or some thermo-couple has gone bad). To be honest, I was a bit lazy in descaling it lately. I ran the de-scaling once I started facing the issue, but it did not fix the problem.

Also, the espresso side of the machine works just fine. Coffee comes out nice and hot on that side. Any tips on how to fix this will be appreciated. Already tried to factory reset, still no luck.
