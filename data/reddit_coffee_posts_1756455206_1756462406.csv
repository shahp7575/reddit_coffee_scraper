1n33f4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n33f4l/aitah_for_going_for_a_friends_ex/,AITAH for going for a friends ex?,"By the title, it already sounds like i’m the AH but hear me out. I (19F) have been friends with Emily (19F) for 10 years. We used to be best friends but we drifted away from each other as we’ve always had a strained relationship. Emily is a rainbow baby and as such her parents coddled her making her unable to navigate conflicts, display attention seeking behaviour and be unable to apologise. Throughout our schooling career our friend group was often in the principals office due to conflicts involving Emily. 

around 4 years ago Emily began a romantic relationship with Steven (19M). Emily and Steven spoke romantically for 3 years on and off without making anything official. Steven was not a good partner to Emily as he had no plans to be in a long term committed relationship with her and had expressed this to her, however Emily could not come to terms with this and decided she would keep on messing around with him in hopes of him changing his mind. To give you an example of how unhealthy this was, Emily sent her friend to convince (more like force) Steven to make things official. Steven was highly uncomfortable with the situation but he did indeed make things official. The two dated for less than two weeks before inevitably breaking up but continuing their unhealthy on and off relationship. Emily would constantly keep tabs on Steven E.g. when he was at the gym and with who, where he was and with who and at what times he arrived and left various locations (gym, school, sporting grounds, parties) in order to be able to confront him concerning any discrepancies in his stories. 

Steven communicated with Emily that he did not have romantic feelings for her however she continued to pursue him resulting in the end of their “relationship”. It was a messy break up, lots of shouting and tears on her end and Steven apologised to her with flowers to try and end on good terms. Steven has been a part of my circle of friends for the better part of 5 years however we did not interact much as i had a poor impression of him based on his situation with Emily, but i did see him at parties and social events. 

fast forward a year after Emily and Steven cut contact, Steven wished me a happy birthday and we started talking from their. With Steven and I being in the same circle it wasn’t odd for us to form a friendly a relationship. i must emphasise that at the beginning it was 100% platonic. We would play video games together from time to time and workout together but that was it. 3 weeks after my birthday Steven, myself and 3 of our friends met at a cafe for coffee and Steven paid for mine and my friends Coffee’s. Emily caught wind of this as she was still keeping tabs on him and she confronted me, calling me a “horrible friend” for being interested in someone that hurt her so badly. I communicated with her that i had no romantic interest in Steven and it was a group hangout but i did apologise nonetheless as i can imagine how hurtful that must be but she never got back to me. Emily then started avoiding me which was awkward as we had the same friends but i didn’t press the matter.

1 month after my birthday i got into a terrible accident that i won’t go into detail about here but i almost lost my life and was hospitalised for a few days. amongst the friends that came to visit me Steven was there. It was mother’s day weekend so he bought both myself, my mother and my grandmother flowers and chocolates. i was unable to walk by myself for a few days so Steven and the rest of my friends made it a point to come visit and help out by bringing me treats and just lightening the mood. On the day Steven came to visit me after i had just gotten out of the hospital i had had my head shaved and was covered in pretty gnarly scars and he told me he wanted to be with me. i was taken aback as i thought our relationship was purely platonic but apparently he had liked me for a long time but after i almost lost my life he said he had to tell me. 

i was traumatised and in no place for a relationship but i did let him know that i reciprocated his feelings but i could not act on them at the moment and he respected that. Following the accent Steven was a rock for me, spending nights with me when i struggled with nightmares, going out with me to do menial tasks as i was terrified of being outside alone and brining me treats and food if i was feeling down. with a shaved head and covered in scars i felt truly hideous but he never let a day go by without telling me how pretty i was and how much he loved me which really meant a lot. Following my return to school a few weeks later people had the decency not to pry about what happened but due to Emily being in my circle she was aware. Due to the nature of the accident i was required to visit a therapist on campus as a condition of my return to school and this would often result in me missing lectures. during one such occasion i heard Emily discussing with her friend how i was “weaponising my trauma” to get Steven to be with me. I couldn’t believe that someone could say something so disgusting following such a traumatic event, but it didn’t hurt much as i do not value her opinion of me.

several months after the accident, Steven asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes. He posted the “proposal” and Emily saw it and our relationship was further strained. 

Here’s where i think i might be the AH. One day one of Emily and Steven’s friends pulled me aside at the end of a lecture and asked if i was okay regarding what emily had been saying about me. when asked to elaborate she told me that Emily had been calling me “disgusting” “untrustworthy” “ a horrible friend” and “easy”. i asked her friend if there was anything i could do to make her feel better because i truly did not want her to feel like this. other people in the lecture hall chimed in saying it was “unnecessary that everyone know our business” and that “Steven isn’t owned by anyone, especially a year after they ended. while this conversation was happening Emily came in and asked me to talk to her outside which i did. as soon as i step outside she starts crying and asked wtf is wrong with me, i’m all for a constructive conversation about how im wrong but that’s not how to start one. Emily then raises her voice asking if i’m stupid and calling me disgusting. i wasn’t replying except to tell her to lower her voice, since it was the end of the day the corridors were packed with professors and students and she was causing a scene. She then told me that I need to stop spreading rumours about her and calling her a “crazy b” which admittedly i did do, but that was following a day where she stalked my social media and liked every post i had related to Steven and i referred to Emily as a crazy b only to two of my close friends but evidently someone overheard. i apologised for my use of language but i informed her that my relationship with Steven is none of her concern and i can understand the pain but this isn’t an appropriate way to behave. she continued cussing and screaming at me and i walked away. which might have been the wrong move considering she was obviously hurting. 

the following night i was on the phone with Steven and she called him, he let me know and i told him to answer because she’s clearly going through a lot and as much as it’s unhealthy, he is the only person she’s ever fully opened up to. On this phone call Emily told Steven that i was bad for him, that i was a horrible person, that i gave it up easy to anyone who would ask and that i was using him for his money. She told him things about me that were completely false and made me sound like a war criminal. I can understand her attachment to Steven as she emotionally relied on him and i never intended to stonewall her from him, rather him and i were going to slowly decrease the frequency in which they spoke to each other until this whole mess was over. Steven however did not tolerate the way she was speaking about me and hung up on her. This allowed her to create the notion that i was isolating Steven from his friends and was displaying the characteristics of a manipulator. (side note: Steven is a bit of a bottom and really enjoys being told was to do and often replies with “yes ma’am” “sorry ma’am” and never contests anything i say which might add to that)

Steven expressed to me that he no longer wanted Emily to contact him and i said that was his choice but either way ill respect what he does, furthermore he no longer attends parties or goes to the club and his friends celebrate him being in a relationship but Emily uses that as more ammunition to paint me as a controlling person. a year later, Emily is still spreading these rumours about me but it’s ramping up again so i want to know, AITAH here?

TL;DR: I got with my friend of over 10 years ex of 4 years a year after they broke up though they were never official and he did not have an interest in her. she is spreading negative rumours about me and it is impacting my relationships AITAH?",0,1756462195.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

Not all water is created equal. Hard Water is a problem for many households and businesses across the UAE. This water contains high levels calcium and magnesium. It may sound harmless but those who live in Dubai and other Emirates know the problems it can cause: limescale, stains, poor soap lather on utensils or appliances, skin drying, and even expensive appliances.

water-softeners are now a must in the UAE. When it comes to finding the best [**water softener suppliers in Dubai, UAE**](https://wet-fzc.com/blog/best-water-softener-supplier-in-uae-for-homes-and-industry/) you will need more than a product. You need a partner that understands the water quality of the region, your specific challenges, and how you can solve them.

This blog will explore the importance of water-softeners and why they are needed in the UAE. We'll also discuss how a reputable Dubai-based provider can change the way that you use water.

[High-capacity industrial RO water treatment plant for pure and safe water.](https://preview.redd.it/hn87ri5gnxlf1.jpg?width=272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f996522858e8e8611759b4811aa49dbc1cb39607)

# Hard Water Problems in UAE

UAE heavily relies on desalinated drinking water. This water travels through storage tanks and pipelines before it reaches your home. The water is contaminated with minerals, mainly calcium and magnesium, during this journey. These minerals, while not harmful to health are what makes water ""hard"".

1. **Limescale build-up**\- white chalky deposits found on taps and showerheads. Also, in kettles and water heaters.
2. **Appliances with a shorter lifespan** – Mineral deposits are often the cause of washing machines, dishwashers and coffee makers failing sooner.
3. **Hair and Skin Problems**\- Hard water strips the natural oils from skin, leaving it dry and frizzy.
4. **More soap, less lather**\-Hard water reduces effectiveness of detergents and soaps, resulting in wastage.
5. **Stains All Over**\- From kitchen sinks to bathroom tiles, cleaning stains is a never ending battle.

You may have already experienced these problems if you live in Dubai or Abu Dhabi. Water softeners have become a necessity in the UAE.

# What is a water softener?

Water softeners are simple but powerful devices that remove hardness-causing minerals in water. They do this by using a process known as ion exchanging. It replaces magnesium and calcium with sodium or potassium to make the water smooth and soft.

What is the result?

* Shiny taps that don't require limescale
* Longer-lasting appliances.
* Skin that is softer and hair that is silkier.
* Spend less on detergent and save money
* Enjoy a better quality of life and greater comfort.

Installed by a reputable supplier in Dubai, water softeners ensure that each drop of water entering your home or office is more effective.

# Why UAE needs reliable water softener suppliers

You can buy water softeners in hardware stores or online, but not all are designed to work with the UAE's unique water. A[ **Dubai water softener provider** ](https://wet-fzc.com/blog/best-water-softener-supplier-in-uae-for-homes-and-industry/)can make a big difference.

1. **Local Expertise**\- A local supplier knows the levels of hardness in Dubai's drinking water and can recommend systems that work.
2. **Tailored solutions** Every property is unique. A villa located in Jumeirah might need an entire house water softener while a small business in Business Bay may only require a compact unit.
3. **After Sales Support** Regular maintenance, refilling salt, and technical service are all critical and can be provided by a reliable supplier in Dubai.
4. **Quality Assurance** – A supplier who is genuine will offer certified products that are backed by warranties and ensure long-term reliability.
5. **Fast service** In a city as fast-paced as Dubai, nobody has time to deal unreliable suppliers. Fast installation and responsive customer service are important.

When you choose the right supplier, you are not only buying a product. You're also investing in your peace of mind.

# How a water softener improves the everyday life in Dubai homes

Imagine a typical day in the household of a Dubai resident before and after installing a water softener.

* **Morning shower** After: smooth, hydrated skin, and shiny, soft hair.
* **Laundry** Before: clothing looks stiff and faded. After: Clothes feel softer and last longer. Colors stay vibrant.
* **Cooking** Before: stained utensils, bad taste of tea or coffee. After: better tasting utensils.
* **Cleaning** Before: scrub hard to remove limescale stains. After: tiles and taps that sparkle with little effort.
* **Appliances** Before: frequent breakdowns, costly repairs. After: appliances that last longer and maintenance costs that are lower.

A water softener is a great investment for your health and comfort. It can also save you money over time.

# Why choose a water softener supplier based in Dubai?

Here are some qualities to look for in a water-softener supplier, particularly in Dubai.

* **Reputation & Experience**\- Positive client feedback and years of service show reliability.
* **Wide Range of Systems**\- Compact residential models up to large industrial softeners.
* **Custom Installs**\- Each client receives a system that is tailored to their needs.
* **Competitive Prices**\- Quality does not always mean expensive. A good supplier will balance both.
* **Professional team** – Skilled technicians to install, service, and provide support.
* **Sustainability focus** – Eco-friendly, water-saving solutions to match Dubai’s green vision.

You don't only get equipment from such a provider, but a solution that will improve your experience on the water.

# Water Softeners to Meet Different Needs

A good Dubai supplier will cater to different clients:

1. **Residential**\- Water softeners are needed for everyday use in villas, apartments and residential complexes.
2. **Commercial**\- Soft water is a great way to increase customer satisfaction in hotels, gyms and salons.
3. **Industrial**\- Industries and factories that use cooling towers or water-based equipment need to install large-scale softening system in order to avoid damage and downtime.

A professional supplier in Dubai will be able to recommend the best system for each sector.

# What is the role of a trusted supplier in Dubai?

Water softener suppliers in Dubai who are reliable don't only sell products, they also build relationships. They play a number of roles, including:

* **Consultation**: Analyzing the water quality of your home and its needs.
* **Product recommendation**\- Suggesting most cost-effective and efficient solution.
* **Installation**\- Ensure the system is configured correctly.
* **Maintenance and Support**\- Regular servicing, quick repairs.
* **Customer Training** – Guide clients in the use and maintenance of the system.

The hands-on approach is a great way to ensure that customers not only get soft water but also gain confidence and trust.

# Why this Matters in the UAE

In the UAE, you will experience extreme heat, desalinated drinking water and a modern lifestyle that is heavily dependent on appliances. Residents face unneeded expenses and discomfort without proper water treatment.

It is for this reason that the role of a supplier in UAE has become more important. Residents and businesses in Dubai can protect their comfort, health and investment by choosing the right partner.

# The conclusion of the article is:

The quality of water can make or break your quality of life. A [**reliable supplier of water softeners in UAE**](https://wet-fzc.com/blog/best-water-softener-supplier-in-uae-for-homes-and-industry/) in Dubai is more than just a vendor. They are also a solution provider and problem solver.

Soft water can make a huge difference in your life. It can protect appliances, improve skin health, reduce cleaning time and enhance lifestyle. With a reputable supplier based in Dubai, you can make a difference with just one installation.

Life has a peculiar way of teaching us lessons when we least expect them. Today, let's dive into some uncomfortable yet liberating truths about our existence that might just change how you see your daily world.

## 🎭 The Happiness Paradox: Why We're Never Satisfied

Ever noticed how the more options we have, the less content we become? We live in an age of infinite possibilities, yet satisfaction seems to slip through our fingers like sand. Your smartphone offers thousands of entertainment options, your streaming service has millions of hours of content, and your local grocery store stocks products from around the globe. Yet here you are, scrolling endlessly, searching for something that feels meaningful.

This isn't your fault – it's human nature. Our brains are wired to always want more, to constantly seek the next upgrade, the next experience, the next achievement. Social media amplifies this by showing us carefully curated highlights from other people's lives, making our own reality seem insufficient by comparison.

**Daily Action Step:** Start a ""gratitude pause"" routine. Before checking your phone each morning, name three things in your immediate environment that you appreciate. This simple practice rewires your brain to notice abundance rather than scarcity.

## 🏰 The Mirage Effect: When Dreams Meet Reality

Remember being a child and thinking adults had everything figured out? That illusion shatters pretty quickly once you become one yourself. The gleaming corporate offices, the picture-perfect social media posts, the confident-looking people in suits – it's all much more fragile than it appears from the outside.

That successful entrepreneur you admire? They're probably dealing with cash flow problems and sleepless nights. That influencer with the perfect lifestyle? They might be struggling with anxiety and the pressure to maintain their image. The couple that seems so happy? They're likely working through the same relationship challenges everyone faces.

This isn't cynicism – it's liberation. Once you understand that everyone is improvising their way through life, you can stop holding yourself to impossible standards.

**Daily Action Step:** When you catch yourself comparing your behind-the-scenes reality to someone else's highlight reel, remind yourself that you're seeing their ""marketing material,"" not their complete story. Focus on making your own life more authentic rather than more impressive.

## 🔍 The Truth Paradox: Navigating Information Overload

We live in the information age, where facts and fiction blend together in an endless digital soup. Everyone has access to the same search engines, yet people arrive at completely different conclusions about reality. The challenge isn't finding information – it's developing the wisdom to evaluate what you find.

Misinformation spreads faster than wildfire because it often tells us what we want to hear or confirms what we already believe. Meanwhile, nuanced truth requires effort to understand and doesn't always provide the emotional satisfaction of simple answers.

**Daily Action Step:** Before sharing or acting on any information, ask yourself three questions: ""Who benefits if I believe this?"", ""What would someone who disagrees with this say?"", and ""What evidence would change my mind?"" This mental framework helps you think critically rather than reactively.

## 👥 The Humanity Crisis: Finding Real People in a Digital World

Cities are more crowded than ever, yet loneliness epidemics plague developed nations worldwide. We're connected to hundreds of people online but struggle to have meaningful conversations with our neighbors. We have more communication tools than any generation in history, yet many feel unheard and misunderstood.

The irony is striking: technology promised to bring us closer together, but it often creates barriers to genuine human connection. We text instead of talk, like instead of love, and follow instead of befriend.

Real human connection requires vulnerability, presence, and patience – qualities that don't thrive in our instant-gratification culture. Yet these connections remain essential for our mental health and sense of purpose.

**Daily Action Step:** Practice the ""phone-free human interaction"" rule. During conversations with family, friends, or even cashiers, keep your phone completely out of sight. Notice how this changes the quality of your interactions.

## 🌱 Building Authentic Relationships in an Artificial World

The solution isn't to retreat from modern life but to approach it more intentionally. Here are some practical strategies for creating genuine connections and finding satisfaction in our complex world:

### Start Small, Think Local

Instead of trying to solve global problems or impress strangers online, focus on the people and community immediately around you. Volunteer at a local organization, join a neighborhood group, or simply make an effort to know your coworkers as individuals rather than just colleagues.

### Embrace Imperfection

Perfect doesn't exist, despite what advertising and social media suggest. The most interesting people are those who embrace their quirks, acknowledge their mistakes, and continue growing. Share your failures as freely as your successes – you'll be surprised how this attracts genuine connections.

### Develop Offline Interests

Cultivate hobbies and skills that don't require screens or internet connections. Gardening, cooking, reading physical books, playing musical instruments, or working with your hands creates a different kind of satisfaction than digital entertainment. These activities also provide natural opportunities to meet like-minded people.

## 🎯 The Power of Small, Consistent Actions

Real change doesn't happen through dramatic gestures or sudden revelations. It emerges from small, consistent actions repeated over time. The person who reads for 15 minutes daily will absorb more knowledge in a year than someone who occasionally binge-reads for hours. The individual who takes a short walk every morning will be healthier than someone who occasionally runs marathons.

This principle applies to relationships, skills, health, and personal growth. Consistency beats intensity every time.

**Daily Action Step:** Choose one small positive action you can commit to for the next 30 days. Make it so easy that skipping it would feel silly. Examples: drinking one extra glass of water, writing one sentence in a journal, or saying ""thank you"" to one person each day.

## 🧭 Navigation Tools for Modern Life

Here are some practical frameworks for making better decisions in our complex world:

### The Time Test
Before making any significant decision, ask yourself: ""How will I feel about this choice in 10 years?"" This perspective helps separate temporary emotions from long-term wisdom.

### The Energy Audit
Regularly evaluate what activities, people, and commitments give you energy versus what drains it. Gradually increase the former and reduce the latter wherever possible.

### The Clarity Question
When feeling overwhelmed by options, ask: ""What would I choose if I could only pick one thing?"" This cuts through analysis paralysis and reveals your true priorities.

## 🚀 Moving Forward with Purpose

Understanding these realities isn't meant to discourage you – it's meant to free you. Once you stop chasing illusions and accept the messy, imperfect nature of human existence, you can focus your energy on what actually matters: building meaningful relationships, developing genuine skills, contributing to your community, and finding contentment in simple pleasures.

Your life doesn't need to be extraordinary to be valuable. Your struggles don't need to be unique to be valid. Your dreams don't need to be grandiose to be worth pursuing.

The goal isn't to have all the answers but to ask better questions. Not to avoid all problems but to choose problems worth solving. Not to eliminate all uncertainty but to become comfortable with ambiguity while still taking decisive action.

## 🌟 Your Next Steps

Today, you have the opportunity to start living more authentically. You can choose connection over comparison, progress over perfection, and presence over productivity. You can build a life that feels genuine rather than impressive, meaningful rather than just successful.

The world will continue to be complicated, people will continue to be imperfect, and truth will continue to require effort to discover. But within this complexity lies beauty, opportunity, and the chance to create something uniquely yours.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. The journey toward a more authentic life begins with a single, honest step forward.

Remember: you're not behind in life, you're not missing out, and you're not broken. You're human, and that's exactly what the world needs you to be.

I hate to throw it away. If anyone wants, please take it. I'm giving it away for free. If you are far from where I live (South Bangalore) book a porter or something. If you feel kind, buy me a coffee or beer, I wouldn't say no. Cheers.

I had already ended my A before my BP found out through my chats. Since then, we’ve had heavy discussions, confessions from both sides, sleepless nights, fights, and emotional ups and downs. I’ve taken full accountability—I am guilty, remorseful, and regret it every single day.

We are trying to reconcile, just the two of us. Therapy or sharing this with anyone else is impossible for us, so please, I’m only looking for positive support, not suggestions to seek therapy.

My question is about triggers during reconciliation. For my BP, it’s the tiny details in the chats he saw with my AP. I don’t even remember them now. I don’t think about AP, but every time my BP brings up triggers, I’ve started associating them too, and now I’m constantly anxious about what might trigger him next.

Triggers can be anything—coffee, music, chocolate, TV shows, songs. Even physical intimacy is affected: BP doesn’t kiss me on the lips, which I crave it so badly during intimacy. BP touches me and kisses me everywhere else, but just not on the lips (because it has been elsewhere.. but so has the rest of me as well) I really don't understand the logic. And I feel like I am constantly punished and very rightfully so. I feel inadequate. So much that I have hurt myself and also have suicidal thoughts.

I want to know—for those who have been through reconciliation after betrayal, what kinds of triggers did your BP experience? How did you cope with them? Will this ever get better?

I really need positive, supportive advice—I’m trying to rebuild trust and intimacy, and any encouragement or insights will help more than anything.

I know this will take time, I just want hope and understanding.",1,1756461340.0,affairrecovery,0,1.0,False

And I’m not talking 15-20 minutes late. She’s at a minimum 45 minutes late. I wanted to meet her for a coffee before I was flying to London and she asked me to meet her at a salon at 2:30. While leaving my house (which is close to the salon) I checked with her if she got parking and she said it’ll be 3:00. Then at 3:00 she said it’ll be 4. I called her out for disrespecting my time and told her that I was flying the next day and had a million things to do and it wasn’t fair to keep me waiting without a heads up. She should have told me when she knew that she was going to be late and not waited for me to ask. She said “I’ve a schedule that keeps me on my toes” and I told her we all do- we all have jobs, lives, responsibilities and families and to do this is disrespectful. She told me I “come off too strong” and asked to stop talking for a while. At this point I lost my temper and said that she always avoided accountability and made it about “energy or coming off too strong” instead of owning up to the fact that she should have been more respectful of my time. 

This isn’t the first time, she’s done this multiple times and I’ve gently told her but she’s never registered. She’s stopped speaking to me and unfollowed me on Instagram

What can I do to create the best impression and experience?,"Hi guys, let me begin by thanking everyone who is taking the time to read this even if you do not leave any comments.

My personal background: My MBTI is ISFP, I consider myself to be shy and really hate public speaking but years of practice has allowed me to be able to appear confident speaking on the outside when in reality I could have a fast heart beat. I have 3 dating experiences and 2 of them they have said they feel like I am boring after 6 months. For me, I have had a strict education from my divorced mum so there are lots of things I have not experienced or would feel conscious in doing despite it not being morally wrong. This includes closing my bedroom doors, being able to date before university, being able to stay out for the night every now and then with my exes, spontaneously deciding to meet for coffee in a few hours since I did not inform her a day in advance. Basically I feel like she is overprotective and micromanaging me at times since she also stalks my bank account to check what I am doing at certain times.

I (23M) have been getting close to a girl (25F) I met once in real life at a birthday party. We got close but they were only here in NZ for a few days and then went back to AU. Ever since, we've gotten much closer through video calling every night and texting consistently throughout the day. Especially over the last few weeks, we've progressed quite a lot, and we've had a few conversations where we both admitted we have romantic interest in each other rather than just friendship. But we have had the talk that to sustain a long term relationship one of us will need to be living in the same city. 

Also maybe something important to note is that my mum has not talked to me for a few weeks now ever since she found out I became interested in a girl and have been talking with her quite often. She has always disliked the idea of me dating

Next month, she will be coming with her best female friend on a trip for 5 days and have invited me to come along as well.

I have 3 previous dating experience which have all lasted more than half a year. I however still consider myself quite inexperienced in talking to women that I am interested in since in my past experiences, I demonstrate my care through actions more so than words. I also do not have too much confidence in terms of charisma to make them laugh or to be able to join in their high tension moments such as when they sing and scream. I know many women around me of all ages and they have all said I make them comfortable and we always can enjoy a good conversation with laughs.

My question now is how to best improve myself leading up to next month before the trip as I feel I might be more nervous especially in front of her friend unless I find some opportunity to have a 1 on 1.

What I am looking for specifically are what cues to look out for during the trip and certain scenarios that may arise for me to naturally present myself in a better light. And I dont mean to do things that are out of character, but sometimes I feel socially awkward or even have been told I could be mildly autistic so I am just overthinking things a little.

Some small actions I have done in the past could just be as simple as taking note of their condition such as wrapping a scarf for them when they are cold, covering table edges when they are bending over to pick stuff off the ground. I guess all small subtle actions in protecting them.

1n334s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n334s7/the_art_of_honoring_trust_why_genuine/,The Art of Honoring Trust: Why Genuine Relationships Matter More Than Ever,"
*Trust is like a delicate flower - it takes years to bloom but can wither in seconds if not nurtured properly* 🌸

In our fast-paced world where connections often feel superficial, there's something profoundly beautiful about someone placing their complete faith in you. When another person chooses to trust you wholeheartedly - whether it's your partner sharing their deepest fears, a friend confiding their struggles, or a colleague depending on your expertise - they're offering you one of humanity's most precious gifts.

## The Weight of Unconditional Trust 💎

Picture this: Your best friend calls you at midnight, voice trembling, asking for help without questioning whether you'll be there. Your elderly parent hands you their life savings, confident you'll manage it wisely. Your spouse supports your career change without demanding a detailed business plan. These moments represent pure, unfiltered trust - the kind that doesn't come with conditions or fine print.

When someone trusts you so completely that they don't feel the need to verify every detail or second-guess your intentions, they're demonstrating remarkable courage. Trust, after all, requires vulnerability. It means choosing hope over fear, connection over isolation.

## The Temptation to Exploit vs. The Choice to Protect 🛡️

Here's where character truly reveals itself. When someone trusts you blindly, you hold tremendous power. You could easily take advantage of their faith, cut corners knowing they won't check, or prioritize your convenience over their wellbeing. The temptation exists because trust creates opportunity - and not everyone handles opportunity with integrity.

But here's the crucial insight: **The person trusting you isn't naive or foolish for believing in you. They're making a conscious choice to see the best in you, even when they could choose skepticism.**

This distinction matters enormously. Too often, we dismiss trusting individuals as ""too innocent"" or ""not street-smart enough."" This perspective is not only unfair but dangerously misguided. It shifts responsibility away from the trusted party and onto the person extending trust.

## Building Your Trust-Worthy Foundation 🏗️

### 1. **Consistency in Small Things**
Trust isn't built through grand gestures alone. It's constructed through countless small actions:
- Showing up when you say you will ⏰
- Keeping confidences, even trivial ones 🤐
- Following through on minor commitments without reminders
- Being honest about your limitations instead of overpromising

### 2. **Transparent Communication**
When someone trusts you completely, they deserve clarity:
- Share relevant updates proactively rather than waiting to be asked
- Admit mistakes early rather than hoping they won't be discovered
- Explain your reasoning when making decisions that affect them
- Ask for input when you're uncertain, rather than pretending to know everything

### 3. **Protective Instincts**
Develop a guardian mindset toward those who trust you:
- Consider their interests as seriously as your own 🤝
- Shield them from unnecessary worry while keeping them informed of important matters
- Advocate for them even when they're not present to defend themselves
- Remember that their trust makes them vulnerable to your choices

## Practical Applications in Daily Life 📋

### In Professional Settings
When colleagues or clients place complete confidence in your abilities:
- Document important decisions and share reasoning behind them
- Provide regular progress updates without being asked
- Seek second opinions on complex matters affecting them
- Prioritize their success alongside your own

### In Personal Relationships
When friends or family members trust you unconditionally:
- Honor their emotional investments with equal emotional commitment
- Remember important details about their lives and reference them naturally
- Support their goals even when they require sacrifice from you
- Create safe spaces for them to express doubts or concerns

### In Financial Matters
When someone entrusts you with their economic wellbeing:
- Maintain detailed records and share them transparently
- Make conservative choices unless explicitly authorized to take risks
- Separate their interests from your own financial decisions
- Consult them before making significant changes to agreed-upon approaches

## The Ripple Effect of Trust-Worthy Behavior 🌊

When you consistently honor the trust placed in you, several remarkable things happen:

**Personal Growth**: You develop stronger character muscles. Each time you choose integrity over convenience, you become someone capable of handling greater responsibilities and deeper relationships.

**Expanded Opportunities**: Trustworthy people attract more opportunities because others feel safe collaborating with them. Your reputation becomes your most valuable professional and personal asset.

**Deeper Connections**: Relationships deepen when trust is consistently honored. People share more, invest more, and commit more fully to relationships where trust flows freely.

**Legacy Building**: Your approach to trust creates patterns that extend far beyond your immediate circle. Children, colleagues, and friends learn from your example and carry these principles forward.

## When Trust is Misplaced: Handling Difficult Situations 🚧

Sometimes, despite your best intentions, you may find yourself unable to fully honor someone's trust due to circumstances beyond your control. In these situations:

**Communicate Early**: Don't wait until the last moment to share bad news or changed circumstances.

**Take Responsibility**: Own your role without deflecting blame onto external factors.

**Offer Solutions**: Come prepared with alternative approaches or ways to minimize negative impact.

**Learn and Adapt**: Use these experiences to better assess your capabilities and commitments in the future.

## The Modern Challenge: Digital Trust 📱

In our interconnected world, trust extends beyond face-to-face relationships:

**Data Privacy**: When people share personal information with you digitally, treat it with the same care you'd want for your own private details.

**Online Representations**: Speak about trusted individuals online with the same respect you'd show in person.

**Digital Reliability**: Follow through on commitments made through digital channels with the same diligence as in-person promises.

## Creating a Trust-Conscious Life Philosophy 🎯

Consider adopting these guiding principles:

**The Trust Test**: Before making decisions affecting someone who trusts you, ask yourself: ""Would I want someone to handle my trust this way?""

**The Long View**: Evaluate choices based on their impact on long-term relationship health, not just immediate convenience.

**The Character Question**: Regularly reflect on whether your actions align with the type of person worthy of unconditional trust.

**The Growth Mindset**: View each instance of trust as an opportunity to strengthen your integrity muscles.

## Moving Forward: Your Trust Action Plan 📈

Starting today, you can begin building a more trust-conscious approach to relationships:

**Week 1**: Identify three people who currently trust you significantly. Reflect on how well you're honoring that trust.

**Week 2**: Have honest conversations with these individuals about their expectations and your commitment to meeting them.

**Week 3**: Implement one specific system or habit that helps you better track and follow through on commitments.

**Week 4**: Evaluate your progress and adjust your approach based on feedback and results.

## The Ultimate Reward 🏆

When you consistently honor the trust placed in you, you don't just maintain relationships - you transform them. You become someone others can rely on completely, which creates a positive cycle of deeper connections, greater opportunities, and more meaningful experiences.

The person who trusts you isn't being naive. They're betting on your character, investing in your potential, and offering you the chance to prove yourself worthy of their faith. This is one of life's greatest privileges and responsibilities.

Remember: **Trust is not about perfect performance - it's about consistent character. It's not about never making mistakes - it's about how you handle those mistakes when they occur.**

In a world increasingly filled with surface-level connections and conditional relationships, choosing to be genuinely trustworthy sets you apart. It makes you the kind of person others seek out during both celebrations and crises. It creates the foundation for a life rich in meaningful relationships and lasting impact.

The next time someone places their complete faith in you, resist the urge to question their judgment or take their trust for granted. Instead, see it for what it truly is: an invitation to become the best version of yourself, and an opportunity to contribute something beautiful to another person's life story.

After all, in a world where trust is rare, being trustworthy isn't just valuable - it's revolutionary. 🌟

1n33365,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n33365/the_hidden_truth_about_physical_attraction_what/,The Hidden Truth About Physical Attraction: What Really Matters Beyond the Surface,"

Have you ever wondered why we're so drawn to outward beauty? Why do we feel that instant spark when we see someone attractive? There's an ancient wisdom that challenges our modern obsession with appearances, and it might just change how you view attraction forever.

## The Illusion We All Fall For 🎭

Every day, we encounter countless faces - on social media, in movies, walking down the street. Some catch our eye immediately, stirring feelings of admiration or desire. We praise flawless skin, perfect features, and symmetrical faces. But here's a thought that might make you pause: what if all that beauty is just packaging?

Imagine for a moment that we could see beyond the outer layer - past the skin, the makeup, the carefully curated image. What would remain? This isn't meant to be morbid, but rather enlightening. The essence of who someone truly is exists far beneath what meets the eye.

## Why We're Wired for Surface-Level Thinking 🧠

Our brains are naturally programmed to make quick judgments based on visual information. It's an evolutionary survival mechanism that helped our ancestors identify potential mates and threats. In milliseconds, we form impressions about:

- Health and vitality
- Social status
- Compatibility
- Trustworthiness

But in our modern world, this ancient programming often leads us astray. We end up chasing shadows while missing the substance that truly matters in relationships and connections.

## The Real Foundation of Lasting Attraction ✨

Think about the people who have had the most positive impact on your life. Was it their physical appearance that made the difference, or was it something deeper? Most likely, it was:

**Their character** - How they treated others, their integrity, and moral compass
**Their mind** - Intelligence, wisdom, humor, and the ability to engage in meaningful conversations  
**Their heart** - Compassion, empathy, and the capacity to love and be loved
**Their actions** - What they did when no one was watching, how they handled challenges

These qualities don't fade with time. They don't require expensive creams or surgical procedures to maintain. In fact, they often grow stronger and more beautiful with age.

## Practical Steps for Deeper Connections 🤝

Here are actionable ways to shift your focus from surface-level attraction to meaningful connections:

**Listen More Than You Look**
Next time you meet someone new, challenge yourself to remember three things they said rather than three physical features. Practice active listening and ask follow-up questions about their thoughts and experiences.

**Observe Actions Over Appearances**
Pay attention to how people treat service workers, how they handle disagreements, and whether their actions align with their words. These behaviors reveal character more than any photo ever could.

**Invest in Your Inner Development**
Focus on building the qualities you want to attract. Read books, develop new skills, practice kindness, and work on becoming the best version of yourself from the inside out.

**Create Meaningful Shared Experiences**
Instead of activities centered around appearance (like photo shoots or appearance-focused events), engage in experiences that reveal personality - volunteering together, problem-solving activities, or deep conversations over coffee.

## The Liberation of Looking Deeper 🗝️

When you shift your focus from external beauty to internal worth, something magical happens:

You become less anxious about your own appearance and more confident in your authentic self. You attract people who value you for who you really are, not just what you look like. Your relationships become more stable and fulfilling because they're built on solid foundations.

## Building Lasting Relationships 💝

The most successful long-term partnerships share common characteristics that have nothing to do with physical appearance:

**Mutual Respect** - Partners who see and appreciate each other's true worth
**Shared Values** - Similar beliefs about what matters most in life
**Emotional Intelligence** - The ability to understand and support each other through life's ups and downs
**Growth Mindset** - Commitment to growing together rather than staying stagnant

## The Daily Practice of Seeing Beyond 👁️

Make it a daily habit to look for the deeper qualities in everyone you encounter:

- The cashier who remains patient despite a long line
- The colleague who always offers to help others
- The friend who remembers important details about your life
- The stranger who holds the door open without expecting recognition

These small observations will train your mind to value character over appearance automatically.

## Why This Matters for Your Future Self 🔮

Imagine yourself decades from now. What kind of people do you want surrounding you? What qualities will matter most when you're facing life's real challenges? Physical appearance fades for everyone, but character, wisdom, and love only grow stronger with time.

By learning to see beyond the surface now, you're investing in relationships and connections that will enrich your entire life. You're also freeing yourself from the exhausting cycle of appearance-based validation.

## The Ripple Effect of Deeper Thinking 🌊

When you start valuing substance over surface, you inspire others to do the same. Your children, friends, and community benefit from this shift in perspective. You become part of the solution to our appearance-obsessed culture rather than part of the problem.

## Final Thoughts: The Choice Is Yours 🛤️

Every day, you have countless opportunities to choose depth over surface, substance over appearance, and character over beauty. It's not about ignoring physical attraction entirely - it's about putting it in proper perspective.

The next time you feel drawn to someone's appearance, take a moment to dig deeper. Ask yourself: ""What else is there to discover about this person?"" You might be surprised by what you find beneath the surface.

Remember, the most beautiful people in the world are often not the ones who catch your eye first, but the ones who capture your heart through their actions, words, and character. These are the people who make life truly worth living, and these are the relationships that stand the test of time.

Start today. Look beyond. See deeper. Your future self will thank you for it.

1n3332r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1n3332r/how_are_others_dealing_with_loneliness/,How are others dealing with loneliness?,"Context - 28M on the south coast of the UK. Just want to preface this with I'm 100% not using this as a replacement for therapy.

I moved back down south at the start of the year after a breakup and unfortunately, lost 99% of my friends due to the breakup. It was my own fault really, I was a shit person, probably still am, but I'm working on improving myself, which includes not drinking - apart from one blip a few weeks back, I've been mostly sober for 6 months or so now. 

I'm really struggling lately, if I'm honest. I work from home, fully remote company with people based nowhere near me, so I don't even have the option of suggesting grabbing a coffee. I find that by the end of the work day, my energy levels are rock bottom, and all I can do is sleep or get into bed and do crosswords for hours to keep my brain busy. It's probably depression, but that's a separate issue. 

I've tried looking at the usual things - [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) for local things, similar interest groups, all the usual suggestions. I'm not a sporty person but I've tried a few clubs. To be honest, they've been mostly fully of ""laddier"" men who are lovely, but we're seemingly just such different people it can be difficult to find a common ground. I'm open minded though, don't want it to seem like I'm looking down on anyone  
  
There's a local board game cafe that does weekly socials but when I finish work at 5pm, getting myself out of the house is so difficult. A few people have posted on our local subreddit about wanting to make friends, I've messaged proactively, not much has come from it. 

I'm getting to the point where the loneliness is starting to feel all-consuming, if I'm honest. Leaving the house to go for a walk on a Friday/Saturday evening and seeing groups of people sitting, enjoying the weather with mates really hits me hard. Online gaming and socialising doesn't have the same release it did when I was 16. 

How do people cope with the loneliness specifically? I enjoy my own company at times, but I seem to only exist in my own company and it makes the days much harder.

In fact, I personally had a couple of experiences myself, as well as some stories from friends. Here are three of them, because they happened close to or after Subuh time:

Story 1: This happened when I was in Standard 3, living at my now late grandma's house. That time we still haven't got piped water supply, so we had to gather rain water in those big pots (tempayan). Bathroom & toilet were also located outside of the house. We also had a pond about 50-100m from the house, under a cempaka tree, with a couple of bana trees nearby.

It was around 5:30-6:00am, and I was about to take my bath & get ready to go to school. When I opened the door to head out for bath, I saw something white, with a bunched up top, next to the banana tree near the pond. My brain tried to recognize what was that object, when it hit me that next to the banana tree was a banana tree stump, and that stump doesn't have a bunched up top. It's a pocong, I thought. 

I immediately slammed the door shut, to which my mom, startled, asked what's up. So I told her what I saw, and she, like most parents would, just dismissed it. Unhappy, I opened the door again to show her, and guess what, where the pocong stood was now the banana tree stump. I decided to drop it and just quickly go take my bath.",1,1756460922.0,Bolehland,2,1.0,False
1n332el,https://www.reddit.com/r/Darts/comments/1n332el/tips_from_a_beginner_for_beginners/,"Tips from a Beginner, for Beginners","I started playing darts about three months ago around the beginning of June when I bought my first dartboard and a couple of sets of brass darts. Just a week later, I picked up two sets of tungsten darts: Harrows Pulse 24g and Harrows Rival 21g, curious to try different weights. That was my first mistake. I had no idea how many more were waiting for me. I thought darts would be easy. I mean, how hard could it be to hit a 45cm diameter board from just over two meters away? Easy-peasy, right? Wrong. Very wrong.

Fast forward three months, and I’ve already hit 17 180s. I don’t think that’s talent or anything special. It’s just the result of consistent practice, watching tutorials, learning techniques, and making a lot of mistakes. Last week, I played at a local pub with a guy who absolutely crushed me. His average over five legs was 89, but he was impressed with my progress and shared some valuable advice. So here are some tips from him and from me that I hope will help other beginners enjoy and improve in this beautiful game:

1. **Want to hit 180s? Train your doubles.** It might sound counterintuitive, but if you can aim well at doubles, you can aim well at treble 20s too. Many beginners (myself included at the begginig of my journey) focus only on hitting 180s, but I came across a video early on that said: “It doesn’t matter how many 180s you hit if you can’t finish the game with a double.” That stuck with me. Doubles are the key. Train them!
2. **Struggling with your throw? Look at your barrel shape.** I had major issues with straight barrels. Wobbly throws, fishtailing, inconsistent releases. Switching to torpedo shaped darts helped instantly. My throws became more stable, and my average improved. But the guy at the pub told me something important: “Torpedo shapes can mask throw issues.” He advised me to keep practicing with straight barrels to fix my technique. I started recording my throws, analyzing grip, dart angle, and release. It helped a lot. Now I throw both shapes well, but I still train with straight barrels for 10–15 minutes daily to refine my throw.
3. **Shape matters more than weight.** Some heavy darts feel lighter due to their shape. It all depends on your grip and throw style. Don’t chase weight, find the shape that suits you. Grip texture also plays a big role. High grip doesn’t mean better grip. Test cheap darts with different shapes before investing in expensive ones. And honestly, I wouldn’t recommend buying premium darts until you’re confident in your game.
4. **Experiment with flights and stems.** Sometimes the issue isn’t your throw, it’s your setup. A different flight shape or stem length might suit your throw better. Try various combinations using inexpensive parts to find what works best for you.
5. **Don’t stress.** If you feel frustration, take a break. Seriously. Trying to hit 180s while stressed will only lead to more misses and more anger. Step away for an hour or two. Relax. Grab a coffee. Reset your mind.
6. **Don’t copy the pros.** Professional players have spent years refining their technique and changing equipment. Instead of mimicking them, develop your own comfortable and consistent throw.
7. **Learn the follow-through.** This might be the most important tip. Without proper follow-through, your technique will suffer, and your average will plateau. Focus on finishing each throw smoothly and consistently.

That’s it! I hope these tips help you on your darting journey. They might seem obvious, but I’ve seen many beginners ignore them and continue throwing without improving—especially when it comes to doubles.

Good luck, and enjoy the game! 🎯

I had already ended my A before my BP found out through my chats. Since then, we’ve had heavy discussions, confessions from both sides, sleepless nights, fights, and emotional ups and downs. I’ve taken full accountability—I am guilty, remorseful, and regret it every single day.

We are trying to reconcile, just the two of us. Therapy or sharing this with anyone else is impossible for us, so please, I’m only looking for positive support, not suggestions to seek therapy.

My question is about triggers during reconciliation. For my BP, it’s the tiny details in the chats he saw with my AP. I don’t even remember them now. I don’t think about AP, but every time my BP brings up triggers, I’ve started associating them too, and now I’m constantly anxious about what might trigger him next.

Triggers can be anything—coffee, music, chocolate, TV shows, songs. Even physical intimacy is affected: BP doesn’t kiss me on the lips, which I crave it so badly during intimacy. BP touches me and kisses me everywhere else, but just not on the lips (because it has been elsewhere.. but so has the rest of me as well) I really don't understand the logic. And I feel like I am constantly punished and very rightfully so. I feel inadequate. So much that I have hurt myself and also have suicidal thoughts.

I want to know—for those who have been through reconciliation after betrayal, what kinds of triggers did your BP experience? How did you cope with them? Will this ever get better?

I really need positive, supportive advice—I’m trying to rebuild trust and intimacy, and any encouragement or insights will help more than anything.

1n32ysb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1n32ysb/the_many_complaints_of_a_guest_with_too_much_free/,The many complaints of a guest with too much free time!,"Working at a hotel means that sometimes you have to deal with issues and complaints that hardly make sense. Occasionally I get nonsense like, “My toaster isn't working!” but when I checked on it, it wasn't even plugged in. Once I even had a person complain that their coffee maker wasn't working when they neglected to put water in it. Then there was the time that a guest complained that a person was doing the crazy activity of sitting in their car in the parking lot. You know, complaints that are so easy to fix or just things that do not matter at all. This is the tale of a guest who is full of these complaints. 

We are a hotel that deals with long term guests. Diana checked into our hotel a few weeks ago. Upon checking in she moved rooms so many times. Mostly because she didn't like that this room didn't have carpet. Or that the bed in this room was slightly uncomfortable. Or that she didn't like the lamp (the lamps are all the same???) She finally settled into a room but you know a difficult guest when you see one. 

Every night since then it's been nothing but complaints. Complaints she must tell me, the night auditor. Complaints that are… nothing burgers. She complained that the lights in the parking lot are not bright enough. (The lights are plenty bright, any brighter and it would cause complaints.) She complained that the trash can isn't close enough to the entrance. (There is a trash can on the sidewalk and another one in the lobby.) She was upset that there is only one station for bags to pick up doggy poo. (We also keep bags at the desk if anyone needs them). It's like. Things that I can't fix and frankly I don't believe need fixing. I mean, still almost valid suggestions though, but silly regardless.

But then came the night that my dear Diana came up with a complaint that honestly made me roll my eyes so hard I'm surprised they didn't fall out of my head. 

So I was in the back laundry room, folding laundry as I do, and I heard her yelling, “Hello?” from the lobby and see her coming up to the desk from the front entrance. I call back, “I'll be right there!” And I go up to the desk. This took me about 10 seconds as it's not a far walk. However, by the time I get up to the desk she's already gone over to the elevator. I call out “Hello?” again but she doesn't answer. The elevator comes down and she leaves.

Alright then? She couldn't wait the 10 seconds it took me to walk to the front. When its 2am. And she knows I have work to do. I can't just stand at the desk staring blankly at nothing for 8 hours. But yeah, sure, walk away after 10 seconds. 

I know I'm going to hear about this later. 

She calls back after a couple hours. It's 4am by this point. My dear Diana starts off by complaining that I wasn't at the desk. I told her I was and that I even called after her. She replies, “Oh yes, I thought I heard you.”

And you didn't think to turn around and acknowledge me at all? Did you ignore me just to have an additional complaint?

She continues, “I mean you have such a weird, I mean, unique voice so I could tell it was you and not Claire (my coworker.) Claire has such a cute voice so I can definitely tell you two apart.”

Was any of that even remotely necessary. I know my voice is a little unique. But what do you expect me to do about it?? I hate when people insult me in such a backhanded way, but whatever. I'm over 30 years old now and I am more than used to my unique qualities. 

So then why did dearest Diana call me for (besides the passive aggressive insults?) Oh boy. Let me tell you.

“So I was walking my dogs outside earlier,” Diana begins to recall her tale, speaking quite earnestly. “I walked past room 172 and I know that guest isn't in right now, but they left their lights on in the room! I was just calling to tell you so you could turn them off!”

Let me tell you how I wanted to laugh in her face. What. Are. You. Talking. About.

First of all, how do you know they aren't in that room? Secondly, why do you care???

I honestly don't even know what to say to this. Honestly. I think I blacked out with the amount that I didn't care about this “issue” that Diana dreamed up. I must've said something like, “That's not an issue.” but I have no recollection of what I actually said. 

“Oh, but I grew up with my grandmother and she always said not to waste electricity-”

I'm not proud of this, but I interrupted her, “I'm sorry, but I need to get back to work.”

I'm still thinking about that moment. It lives rent free in my head. A room. At a hotel. Had their lights on. And this is worth calling me at 4am. Fantastic. I don't think I can ever get a complaint more mundane than that in my life.

I've put these refuse warriors to the ultimate test in my daily routine, and they’ve stood their ground in both predictable and challenging scenarios. From everyday kitchen waste to random household storage needs, these bags have seen it all.

**Design and Build Quality**  
My very first impression? These are not your average flimsy bags prone to splitting at inconvenient moments. The Texas Tough bags come in a neat, stackable rectangular box that keeps everything organized. Having everything in one place means no running around the house trying to find misplaced rolls of trash liners. The zipper closure type adds a touch of functionality that seems minor until you realize this small detail saves a lot of mess. The bags themselves feel durable and reliable, and their solid pattern gives them a clean, no-nonsense look.  

[Check Texas Tough All-In-One Box price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b08w4pq6vx/)

**Performance Under Pressure**  
The name ""Texas Tough"" isn’t just marketing flair. These trash bags have lived up to their promise of toughness. I’ve used them for heavy kitchen scraps, outdoor cleanup, and even storing old clothes, and they didn’t let me down. The bags’ generous size worked well for medium to large-sized trash bins, while their reinforced design handled even heavier loads without tearing. Although they're not microwaveable (obviously, not exactly a common feature for trash bags), you can bet on their strength when it counts. Whether it’s wet coffee grounds or bits of splintered wood, the bags held up well.

**Usage Versatility and Stackability**  
There’s something amazing about a trash bag that’s not just meant for trash. The Texas Tough bags have proven to be a truly versatile addition to my home. I’ve used them to store seasonal decorations, keep important items in a sealed environment, and even manage my kids’ overwhelming collection of toy pieces. The stackable storage case is a blessing—unlike rolls of trash bags that often come unwound in your drawers.

**Benefits**  
- Longevity: Having 370 bags at your disposal means not having to constantly restock.
- Quick-dispensing design: Grabbing a bag is straightforward and fuss-free.
- Stackable box: Perfect for easy storage and keeps the bags in pristine condition.  

**Critiques to Consider**  
- Lack of scented options: A perfumed variant might be a welcome addition for kitchen use.
- Non-microwaveable: Though niche, some might find it limiting for certain unique storage needs.
- Zipper feature: While handy, it might take a bit of trial and error to master how snugly the bag fits around certain bins.

**Competing Options**  
Compared to industry heavyweights like Glad or Hefty, Texas Tough shines in its capacity and storage-friendly design. Glad and Hefty commonly sell trash bags on large rolls, which can unravel or get crushed in overcrowded spaces. However, they do offer scented varieties, which some users might prioritize. That said, the Texas Tough All-In-One Box tips the scale by giving you quantity, quality, and convenience all rolled into one.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When you consider the number of bags in the box and their strength, this product offers excellent value for its cost. Sure, it’s tempting to grab whatever’s cheapest at your local store, but flimsy bags that tear halfway through the job only lead to frustration. This box promises durability and delivers exactly that over and over again, making it more of an investment in hassle-free waste management.

1n32wak,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1n32wak/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

*A journey through the wisdom we accumulate as we navigate relationships, challenges, and self-discovery*

---

## 🌱 The Beginning of Understanding

Life has a peculiar way of teaching us lessons we never signed up for. One day you wake up and realize that the way you approached relationships, friendships, and even your own dreams has fundamentally shifted. This isn't about getting older – it's about getting wiser through experience.

## 💔 The Reality Check About Love and Connection

### Learning the Difference Between Connection and Control

There's a moment when it hits you: loving someone doesn't mean keeping them locked in a cage of your expectations. Real affection thrives when both people feel free to be themselves. You discover that genuine care means giving space, not building walls around another person.

Think about it – when you try to control every aspect of someone's choices, you're not showing love. You're showing fear. Fear of losing them, fear of them changing, fear of not being enough. But authentic connection happens when two people choose each other daily, not because they're trapped, but because they want to be there.

### Physical Intimacy vs. Emotional Bond

Here's something nobody tells you when you're young: physical attraction and deep emotional connection are two completely different things. You can have amazing chemistry with someone who doesn't understand your core values. You can feel physically drawn to someone who would never support your dreams.

The magic happens when both elements align, but expecting one to automatically create the other? That's where disappointment lives. Understanding this distinction saves you from years of confusion and heartache.

### Security vs. Companionship

Being around people doesn't equal feeling secure. You can be surrounded by a crowd and feel completely alone. You can be in a relationship and still feel uncertain about your future. Real security comes from within – from knowing who you are and what you stand for, regardless of who's standing next to you.

## 🎯 The Truth About Promises and Expectations

### When Gestures Don't Equal Guarantees

Every romantic movie sells us the same lie: that certain actions automatically mean certain commitments. A kiss means they're into you. A gift means they care long-term. But real life operates differently.

Actions in the moment are exactly that – actions in the moment. They might indicate feelings, but they don't create contracts. Learning this saves you from building entire futures on single moments of kindness or attraction.

### Accepting Disappointment with Dignity

Nobody enjoys losing, whether it's a job opportunity, a relationship, or a dream you've been chasing. But here's what experience teaches: how you handle defeat shapes who you become more than how you handle victory.

When things don't work out, you have two choices. You can become bitter and blame external circumstances, or you can learn what the experience taught you and move forward with that knowledge. The second option is harder in the moment but leads to actual growth.

## 🏗️ Building Your Life on Solid Ground

### Why Today Matters More Than Tomorrow

Planning is important, but building your entire happiness on future events is risky. Tomorrow's plans have a habit of changing unexpectedly. Economic shifts, health changes, relationship developments – so many factors beyond our control can reshape our carefully crafted futures.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't have goals. It means your contentment shouldn't depend entirely on those goals working out exactly as planned. Find satisfaction in today's progress, today's relationships, today's small victories.

### When Too Much of Anything Becomes Harmful

Even positive things can become destructive in excess. Too much attention can make you dependent on external validation. Too much comfort can make you stagnant. Too much of anything – even good things – can throw your life out of balance.

Recognizing when you've had ""enough"" of something beneficial requires self-awareness. It's about understanding that moderation applies to everything, not just obviously harmful behaviors.

## 🌺 Cultivating Your Own Garden

### Why Self-Reliance Matters

Waiting for someone else to make you happy is like waiting for someone else to exercise for you – it simply doesn't work that way. Your emotional well-being, your personal growth, your sense of fulfillment – these are inside jobs.

This doesn't mean you should isolate yourself or refuse help from others. It means taking responsibility for your own development, your own joy, your own sense of purpose. When you do this, relationships become additions to your happiness rather than the sole source of it.

### Discovering Your Own Strength

Crisis has a way of revealing capabilities you never knew you possessed. When life forces you to handle challenges alone, you often discover you're more resilient than you imagined. This realization changes everything.

Knowing you can survive difficulties doesn't mean you want to face them alone forever. But it does mean you approach relationships and opportunities from a position of strength rather than desperation. You choose people and situations because they add value to your life, not because you need them to save you.

## ⏰ The Evolution of Relationship Understanding

### Future-Based vs. Present-Based Connections

Some people enter your life promising amazing tomorrows, but when you're with them, you find yourself missing your yesterdays. This happens when a connection is built on potential rather than present compatibility.

Real compatibility shows itself in daily interactions. Do you enjoy spending ordinary Tuesday evenings together? Can you handle mundane tasks side by side? Do you laugh about the same things? These present-moment indicators matter more than grand promises about future adventures.

### Love That Accepts vs. Love That Demands Change

Genuine care accepts people as they are while supporting their voluntary growth. Controlling behavior disguises itself as care but actually demands that people change to meet your preferences.

The difference? Acceptance doesn't require change for love to continue. It offers support if someone wants to grow but doesn't withdraw affection if they stay the same. Demanding behavior makes love conditional on specific changes happening.

### Companionship vs. Filling a Void

Using relationships to avoid dealing with your own inner work creates an unfair burden on the other person. They become responsible for your emotional state, your entertainment, your sense of purpose. This pressure eventually destroys even strong connections.

Healthy relationships happen between two people who enjoy their own company and choose to share that enjoyment with someone else. They enhance each other's lives rather than completing missing pieces.

## 👥 The Reality of Friendship

### Quality Over Quantity

Social media makes it seem like having hundreds of connections equals popularity, but real friendship operates differently. Authentic friends are those who show up during both celebrations and crises. They're the ones who tell you difficult truths when you need to hear them and support your dreams even when they don't fully understand them.

These relationships require maintenance, just like any valuable thing in life. If you don't invest time and energy in nurturing real friendships, you'll find yourself surrounded by people who know your name but not your character.

### The Permanence of Spoken Words

Anger makes us say things we can't take back. In heated moments, we often use our knowledge of someone's vulnerabilities as weapons. Those words continue causing damage long after the anger subsides.

Understanding this doesn't mean suppressing all negative emotions. It means learning to express frustration without attacking the person's core worth. It means taking time to cool down before having important conversations. It means recognizing that some words, once spoken, change relationships permanently.

## 🔄 The Power of Forgiveness and Accountability

### The Difference Between Apology and Forgiveness

Anyone can say ""sorry"" when they realize they've caused damage. The words cost nothing and often make the speaker feel better immediately. But forgiveness requires emotional work from the person who was hurt. It's a process, not a response to magic words.

Real apologies involve understanding the impact of your actions, taking responsibility without making excuses, and changing behavior to prevent similar harm. Forgiveness involves choosing to release resentment for your own peace, regardless of whether the other person has ""earned"" it through their response.

### When Relationships Don't Recover

Some damage can't be undone, no matter how much both parties want to fix things. This doesn't mean anyone is a bad person – it means that certain actions change the fundamental dynamic of a relationship.

Accepting this reality allows you to focus energy on relationships that can be repaired and improved rather than exhausting yourself trying to resurrect connections that have run their natural course.

## 🎭 The Consequences of Our Actions

### What Goes Around, Comes Around

People who consistently treat others poorly rarely escape experiencing similar treatment themselves. This isn't about cosmic justice or supernatural punishment – it's about natural consequences in social environments.

When you regularly dismiss, humiliate, or disrespect others, you create a reputation that follows you. People talk, patterns become visible, and eventually, you find yourself experiencing the same treatment you've been dishing out.

Understanding this helps you choose your actions based on the kind of treatment you want to receive from the world.

## 🎯 The Importance of Present-Moment Living

### Why Rushing Backfires

Forcing outcomes rarely produces the results we hope for. Whether it's pushing a relationship to move faster, demanding immediate career advancement, or trying to accelerate personal growth, pressure often creates resistance.

Natural timing allows things to develop organically, creating stronger foundations and more sustainable results. This doesn't mean being passive – it means taking consistent action while allowing results to unfold in their own time.

### Recognizing the Good Times While You're In Them

Nostalgia has a way of making past experiences seem more wonderful than they actually were. But sometimes, the moments we'll treasure most are happening right now, and we're too busy worrying about the future to fully experience them.

Learning to recognize present happiness while you're living it requires intentional awareness. It means putting down your phone during conversations that matter. It means noticing small pleasures instead of only focusing on big goals.

## 💬 The Timing of Important Conversations

### Before It's Too Late

We often postpone difficult conversations, thinking we'll have unlimited opportunities in the future. We assume people will always be available for apologies, expressions of appreciation, or admissions of need.

But life doesn't provide endless chances. People move away, relationships change, health situations develop, and sometimes people leave our lives permanently. The conversation you keep putting off might become impossible to have.

This doesn't mean you should have every difficult conversation immediately, but it does mean recognizing when timing matters and not letting fear prevent important communications indefinitely.

## 🌟 The Journey Continues

Growing through life experiences is an ongoing process, not a destination you reach and then stop. Each phase of life brings new lessons, new challenges, and new opportunities for understanding yourself and others more deeply.

The wisdom that comes from living through various experiences – both positive and difficult – shapes us into people who can navigate complexity with greater skill and compassion. We learn to make decisions based on understanding rather than assumptions, to build relationships based on reality rather than fantasy, and to find contentment in the present while still working toward meaningful goals.

This journey of growth through time isn't always comfortable, but it's always valuable. Each lesson learned, each pattern recognized, each moment of clarity adds to your ability to live with intention and authenticity.

The most important realization? You don't have to wait for time to teach you everything. You can choose to pay attention, to learn from both successes and failures, and to apply that knowledge to create a life that reflects your values and brings you genuine satisfaction.

*Remember: wisdom isn't about age – it's about paying attention to life's lessons and choosing to grow from them.*

For context, my mum is turning 41 this December and over the years she has complained about the fact that her closest friends have all drifted away from her, reaching the point where even if she contacts them, they may never reply. Everyone has busy lives and she understands this but as a woman who has three kids, a full-time job as a store manager at a jewellery store (works 48 hours or 32 hours per week), and still calls or texts her friends and family everyday, I would say their ’busy’ lives is bullshit. She is a very kind woman, yes she is honest but these people have known her since high school, some since a year or two after graduation. They don’t even call her back if they miss her call, no text or anything. She cries in my arms about how lonely she is and she is even blaming herself saying that maybe shes the problem. Thing is though, she does nothing but put everyone else’s needs above hers and that minor thing you tell her 4 weeks ago she will remember and ask about! (I know I‘m bias because she is my mum).

As well as losing all of her friends as she gets older, her parents and siblings have all moved away after she specifically moved to our town for them. I know they are allowed to move but it still hurts that they don’t make the same effort to keep in touch. She misses being able to go up the road to her parents house and have a cup of coffee on a Sunday, or have dinner at theirs a few times a week; now they call her maybe once a week. Yes, they are busy but her brothers are able to see them whenever they want and she is jealous. 

My dad also is no help. He is a very self-centred man and she isn‘t a priority and he can’t say otherwise. I love my dad, but I would never marry a man like him. She went and got an MRI scan today on her knee, a torn meniscus shes been living with for the past 8 months, she then went to work for 8 hours. My dad, who went golfing today, never messaged her to ask how it went, even though she has brought up multiple times the fact that she wants him to message her at work because she misses him. He just doesn’t and gets angry when she cries. He does care but he doesn’t make an effort to make her feel better. He doesn’t listen to her vent, instead goes on his phone or says, “Who cares about them? Do what you want.” She wants to have friends.

Obviously there are more deeper issues and specific things I won’t go into detail about but I am worried. Loneliness is a big killer and I don’t want my mum to go somewhere dark. I see her cry and I listen and I try my best to give her advice but I’ve barely lived my life and don’t know what to do. I’m open to any creative ideas.

I've been loving my aeropress with medium dark to dark roast coffee as that's what I've always been used to, but then I started diving into more expensive coffee and browsing this sub and r/coffee and everyone seems to agree that light roast is the best. I followed James Hoffmans recipe, 11g/200ml water, steep for 2 minutes, swirl, wait another 30 and then press. Worked great for the medium and dark roasts I was using, but no matter what I do with the light roast I got, it has this weird sour taste to it. Maybe that's how light roast is supposed to taste? I don't know. I don't have a grinder at the moment, ordered a df54 last night so it should be here soon. Currently relying on drink trade to grind for aeropress until it gets here.

DVA / PTI / De Tian at The Leadmill in Sheffield.

DVA played 2 sets. 

The main one being: North Loop, Uncertain, Sensorium, 4 Hours and Piano Pain. 

The earlier first set was a semi-improvised piece. In my diary it's called 'The Clock DVA Theme', but it was also known (briefly) as 'The Psychedelic Angler'. 

The latter title was inspired by someone unknown to us painting the word BREAM in huge white letters on the outside wall of our rehearsal room.

My diary says the gig was recorded and filmed by the Cabs. I wouldn't mind hearing that again.

The rest of the weekend was slow. I decided that this was likely going to be one of those keystone points in this life. As such, it called for a good meal.  
  
I stopped by the store the next day and got meat and made some butter basted steaks with a side of some loaded baked potatoes for myself and the Hendersons. They were a tough sort and were back in their home the same day the police decided they were done with the place.  
  
Olivia had called the next day. It seemed she was fine at least. I listened to her ramble about her day as I relaxed for bed that night. It was cute, and reminded me of my own children in my previous life. I didn't really have the intention of responding to the calls, but listening to the answering machine at least it sounded like she was working out her own problems just by talking.  
  
The next Tuesday I hear something back from the Guardians. It felt a little early to me, but I was not fully surprised. They were likely one of the fastest moving agencies on the planet, and while a single business day turnaround was impressive it could be expected from such an agency.  
  
“Drifter, this is P.R. Director Madischild. We would like you to come in today after your classes. If you could please link up with Mist and Lady Verdant as you come in.” Her voice was almost singing as she spoke.  
  
Someone was having a good day at… I checked the message time on the digital display for the answering machine to see when she called. Zero four-hundred. I made a mental note that the woman was an early bird as I got ready to head out to my morning workout routine while the message played.  
  
“Also please update your contact information to a direct contact number. If you do not have one we will provide a work phone to you.” And with that she hung up.  
  
I supposed it would be one of those jobs. It made sense though that superheroes were always on call.  
  
The morning routine was refreshing at least. A jog around a mountain, then Sisyphus inspired a workout of rolling rocks up and down the mountain side. Sometimes using them a little like I would for old cinder-block exercises when I was younger. Then it was home, shower, and classes.  
  
Professor Sandersdottir came into the lecture hall not long after I did, making her one of the few people here before the time for class was to start. It was a little rare for professors in this college to arrive before the students.  
  
She set-up a laptop, a cup of coffee, and sat behind her desk waiting. When the time for class came and people were piled in, she started.  
  
“Alright ladies. Who brought today’s topics?” She asked, looking over the gaggle of students spread throughout the class.  
  
A few raised their hands and one was called on.  
  
“For my topic I would like to propose that the emergence and popularity of Meta Humans and the discovery of how they gain their powers will end war.” That had my attention. I tempted a glance at the woman before deciding it was better to close my eyes and listen.  
  
“Interesting. I will give you a few minutes to present why you think that and then allow counterpoints.” Sandersdottir said calmly, still typing away.  
  
I cannot fully control how my power gives me information, but I had a loose way to control it. As curiosity struck me I focused on the laptop. The Laptop was of a modern gaming design. The Laptop was being used as both a home and work computer. The Laptop had a list of dossiers of class students based on worksheets we filled out when applying to the class. The laptop had various 4 x strategy games on it. The Laptop had a hidden pornography folder.  
  
I closed my eyes and turned my head away. I now had a vivid mental image of what was in that folder and I really wish I did not. Still it answered a question. This format was not as lazy as it appeared. She called on the girl because she had an idea of what the woman would want to talk about.  
  
She likely called on this student because her fascinations are meta humans and war. Strong topics that would catch the interest of the class early in the semester so they stay involved with the class.  
  
“Yes Professor.” The young woman continued. “We’ve already seen it to an extent. Once it was made public that traumatic events could cause the emergence of superpowers some groups across the world have scaled back their terror tactics. I think they saw the link themselves with people they tortured developing powers mid session and going off like a bomb.” 	She paused and looked up at me, the most obvious meta in the room and said, “Err.. no offense.” To which I just shook my head and gestured for her to continue.  
  
“Right. So what we have seen is a general down-scaling across the world already in terror tactics, and most first world nations have not declared a war in general since the public discovery and acknowledgment of superpowers.”  
  
“Interesting. Does anyone have a counterpoint?” While I had some to say on this topic I decided to delay in raising my hand until I saw other hands go up.  
  
Another woman, older, in the front row raised her hand and was called on. “You there, go ahead.” She had a buzz cut which was a common haircut among women in this world that worked harder labor or security jobs. This one though was a soldier.  
  
It was interesting to me that the teacher was intentionally pretending to not know who she was calling on and why. Was this going to be something revealed in the class later? She had noticed my gaze was fixed more on her than the rest of the speakers, and she adjusted in her seat.  
  
“It’s not going to end war. It’s just going to change. Terror tactics that can result in the birth of a Meta human will become less common, yes. But that just means they will have to break the spirit of countries in different ways. Most likely war will become a whole hell of a lot more lethal, and it’s already plunged us into basically another cold war.” She said towards the younger woman.  
  
“It’s sort of a public secret that you can find videos all over the internet that China and Russia are doing illegal human experimentation to see how to and what types of people they can turn into super weapons. I would venture that our own government is doing it too and just trying to keep it secret from The Guardians, who are cracking down on that shit.” She finished.  
  
The teacher nodded at that. To her credit the woman who had originally brought up the point had remained silent through the counterpoint. The teacher pointed back to the student. “Any counter argument before we see if anyone else has something they would like to add?”  
  
“Err, Thank you again Professor.” She said towards her then looked down at the soldier. “While I cannot really deny all of that. We only have speculation on human experimentation as none of it is proven. The few cases that have been proven were quickly stopped by the Guardians. No one wants that sort of pressure united against their country. And if the professor will humor me, I do have a website from the International Office of Statistics that shows that wars have become less common since the nine-teen nineties. With the exception of the global war on terror.”  
  
I could tell she really wanted to believe this. She had gone through the effort of finding information that supported her argument. Though I think that was likely the flaw here, and I was more inclined to agree with the soldier on the topic.  
  
The teacher flagged her down to the front, and soon enough she set up the classroom projector to show a website that showed the number of declared wars being fought on the planet at any given point for the past hundred years. The number did indeed sharply decline in recent years. Though it was around the eighties and not the nineties that it started.  
  
“Counterpoints?” The professor asked.  
  
As hands went up, my own went up and I was immediately called on this time. “You there in the back.” She said towards me.  
  
“Thank you Ma’am.” I said with a bow of my head. “The simple fact is statistical data like this can be misleading. I do not mean to disparage my classmate when I point this out, but Correlation is not Causation. You will see that the number of wars was already dropping sharply before the public discovery of super powers, and I believe if we look we will likely find that it correlates with another event that may be the cause in the form of The United Nations gaining more power and traction in those years, with interventionist action instead of just sanctions.”  
  
I steepled my fingers as I was speaking and it was becoming a bad habit. I likely looked like some massive plotting demon.  
  
“I believe the young miss started with a conclusion and then went to find information that supported it rather than drawing her conclusion from information she had on hand. It is not something to fault her for though, and likely everyone here has and does do the same quite often.”  
  
The teacher nodded. “That is an interesting take-away. And it is one of the lessons I am hoping to impart in this class. As he has pointed out, yes, most people seek information to support their beliefs rather than drawing their beliefs solely from information they have on hand. Humans are creatures that rationalize rather than rational creatures.” She said with a smile.  
  
The screen changed to a prepared presentation on that exact fact labeled ‘Bias.’. I admit, I felt a little played here. I knew what she was doing, but somehow she read things well enough to know what my counter argument would be and have a lesson prepared around it. “For the debate portion of the class please see me after class if you took part. For now though, let’s get into the lecture…”  
  
I had done well evidently. Ten points for my part in the debate. Only two classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays meant that my courses ended around Midday now that the official schedule of classes were in effect.  
  
I went to where I knew for certain I could find at least one of the people I was meant to hook up with. The Security office on the campus almost always had a guardian in it. The college in the city was a major congregation spot for people and as such there was a concern that a bitter super powered person would make a target of it. As such to put student’s minds at ease the administration had put in a special lounge and office for guardians when they are on campus.  
  
When I had gotten there I showed my I.D. to one of the unpowered Guardian soldiers and they let me in. The super powered organization was made up of far more people without powers than people with them. Those with powers seemed to make up only one percent of the group, and the other ninety-nine percent of it was logistics and security handled by unpowered people that surrounded them.  
  
Mist arrived not long after I did. When she walked in and saw me inside the lounge she seemed to light up. It caused me to raise an eyebrow at her. She always acted like she knew me despite our only interactions being her trying to recruit me.  
  
“Gabriel.” She chirped my name as she crossed the room and sat. “I am glad you decided to join us. Have you been here long?”  
  
“No.” I put away a book I had pulled out earlier. “I had just gotten here. My class ended about ten minutes ago.”  
  
Something about written media triggered my power less than anything animated, so books tended to be one of my entertainments of choice when I lacked for something to do with myself. Music, audio stories, and art were fairly high up there as well, but most of those hobbies were actually a fair bit more expensive. Comparatively, dollar book stores were a thing in the city and it was not hard to go find and pick up a good story someone had donated when clearing out their storage.  
  
“Oh! Good. Uh.. have you been treated okay? Do you need something to drink or eat?” She asked, growing a bit more nervous.  
  
It dawned on me this was generally around the part of a conversation where I would normally shut her down and walk away. It was rare since that start that I ever gave her more than two sentences. Why was she even nice to me?  
  
“Something sweet if you can. My powers burn a lot of energy. Black coffee or something of that nature to wash it down.” I said simply.  
  
She didn’t get up, instead she folded her hands in her lap and nodded to me as she relaxed back. There was a momentary irritation at being asked only for her to do nothing. However she did not strike me as the sort of person that would ask just to ask.  
  
“I admit, I am at a little bit of a loss? Every time we have talked before I have only ever had asking you to join us and selling points for doing so as a pretext. What do you do for fun? Just read?” She asked with a burgeoning curiosity.  
  
“Something like that. It occupies the mind if I am not busy with something else. I have other hobbies, but most do not lend themselves to walking around campus.” My voice was even and measured.  
  
I did not match her enthusiasm or friendliness. I had been spiteful towards this woman for long enough that being cold to her was second nature now. I would have to find a way to break that habit if I was going to work with her.  
  
“Huh. Well if you are going to be on campus taking classes like Verdant and myself we can probably set you up something in here? We have a cooling station for Verdant’s laptop because she likes to play games in the other room.”  
  
I was about to respond when there was a knock at the door, and then it opened. One of the unpowered soldiers from outside dropped off some doughnuts and coffee. I sat up and reached out accepting both from her.  
  
“Thank you.” I offered before taking out a doughnut and biting from it.  
  
I hated to admit it but I was starving. That was almost a constant for me. Power use quickly drained me physically and left me hungry. Any sane person would likely have reduced their power usage from that. I was likely not sane and it led me to using them more often. Something about it worked like a muscle and the more I used them the further I could push without draining myself.  
  
Mist didn’t speak, even after the officer left. I decided to take a moment to satisfy a curiosity of mine.  
  
“Why are you nice to me? I certainly have not been kind to you.” I asked with a perk of my brow. “Most people would hold a grudge.”  
  
“Oh! Well.. you had your reasons. After what you went through anyone would be hostile to-.”  
  
“You know about my past?” I cut her off. The voice once again came out cold, and I could hear my heart in my throat. “Has Panth-”  
  
“No! No.. nothing like that.” It was her turn to interrupt me.  
  
Her palms were out in a defensive position, and she had sounded panicked. I realized that I had started to get up and forced myself to sit back down. It not being Pantheon running her mouth did not make me feel any more at ease. Had she read my file? Were sealed files so easy for Guardians to access? There was an official story and what actually happened as well, which version did she know?  
  
“I.. knew your mother.” She said quietly.  
  
“No. You didn’t. No one did. Not even me.” My voice dripped with unintended malice.  
  
I felt that gnarled root around my heart stir. It was a constricting painful feeling. Always tightly wound, always on guard, always looking for what was going to hurt it next ever since I woke up. They weren't initially my feelings. They belonged to the Gabriel before me, but they eventually became mine. It was hard to control.  
  
She didn’t have a response to me, and we sat in silence. It took an hour for Verdant to arrive after that.",2,1756458909.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Life has a beautiful way of unfolding in stages, much like a flower blooming or a river finding its way to the ocean. Today, let's explore three profound stages of personal development that can transform how we experience our daily lives, relationships, and inner peace. These stages aren't bound by any particular belief system – they're universal human experiences that anyone can understand and work toward, regardless of their background or worldview.

## Stage One: The First Awakening Moment ✨

### That Life-Changing Glimpse

Have you ever had a moment where everything suddenly felt different? Maybe you were walking in nature, listening to music, or simply sitting quietly when suddenly – for just a brief instant – you felt completely present and connected to something larger than yourself?

This is the first stage of inner transformation: **The Glimpse of Wholeness**.

🔍 **What It Feels Like:**
During this stage, your usual mental chatter stops for a moment. You're not thinking about tomorrow's meeting or yesterday's argument. You're simply... here. Present. Aware. It's like stepping outside during a storm and suddenly finding yourself in the eye of the hurricane – perfectly calm and clear.

Your everyday personality and concerns are still there, but you suddenly realize there's something beyond your usual worries and thoughts. It's as if you've been living in a small room your whole life, and someone just opened a window to show you there's an entire world outside.

🌱 **The Seed is Planted:**
This brief experience plants a seed in your heart – a deep longing to experience that peace and clarity again. It's like tasting the most delicious meal of your life; you can't forget it, and you want to experience it again.

**Daily Life Applications:**
- Pay attention to those small moments of peace in your day
- Notice when you feel truly present (not thinking about past or future)
- Practice simple breathing exercises to create space between thoughts
- Spend time in nature without distractions
- Practice gratitude for small, beautiful moments

## Stage Two: Building Your Inner Sanctuary 🏠

### Creating Order from Within

The second stage is where real transformation begins. Instead of those fleeting glimpses, you start developing the ability to create and maintain inner peace more consistently.

🧘 **What Changes:**
Your inner world becomes more organized. The constant mental chaos that used to define your daily experience starts settling down. You develop what we might call ""inner wisdom"" – the ability to respond rather than react, to pause before speaking, to find calm in stressful situations.

Think of it like learning to play a musical instrument. At first, you might accidentally play a beautiful note (stage one), but in stage two, you're actually learning the scales and can play simple melodies on purpose.

💫 **The Subtle Shift:**
There's still a part of you that identifies with your name, your role, your story – but it's much quieter and less demanding. It's like the difference between a screaming toddler and a calm adult having a conversation. Your ego is still present, but it's not running the show anymore.

**Practical Development:**
- You can spend hours feeling centered and peaceful
- You're less reactive to daily stressors  
- You feel more connected to your authentic self
- Decision-making becomes clearer and more intuitive
- Relationships improve as you become less defensive

🎯 **The Effort Stage:**
Here's the thing about stage two – it requires conscious effort. It's like going to the gym; you need to keep showing up and doing the work. The good news is that now you know it's possible, and you have a clear direction.

**Daily Life Strategies:**
- Establish a regular meditation or quiet time practice
- Use breathing techniques during stressful moments
- Practice mindful listening in conversations
- Create boundaries to protect your energy
- Engage in activities that connect you to your deeper self
- Learn to pause before reacting emotionally
- Cultivate patience as a daily practice

## Stage Three: Coming Home to Yourself 🌊

### When the River Meets the Ocean

The third stage is where something truly remarkable happens. Remember how we talked about the river in stage two? Well, imagine that river finally reaching the ocean and becoming one with it. That's stage three – complete integration.

🌊 **The Great Transformation:**
At this point, finding your center isn't something you have to work at anymore – it becomes as natural as breathing. You don't need special techniques or perfect conditions to access inner peace; it's simply who you are now.

Your sense of separation from life dissolves. You're still uniquely you, but you also feel connected to everything around you. It's like being a wave that realizes it was always part of the ocean.

**Universal Recognition:**
This experience has been described across cultures and throughout history:
- Some call it ""the great connection""
- Others refer to it as ""ultimate peace""
- Many describe it as ""coming home""
- Some see it as ""pure awareness""
- Others experience it as ""unconditional love""

✨ **Natural Flow:**
In this stage, accessing that deep inner peace becomes effortless. It's like learning to ride a bike – once you've got it, you've got it. You can access this state of consciousness whenever you choose, just like you can choose to look up at the sky whenever you want.

**Living from This Place:**
- Stress still happens, but it doesn't disturb your fundamental peace
- You respond to life from wisdom rather than fear
- Relationships become more authentic and loving  
- Decision-making flows from clarity rather than confusion
- You feel genuinely connected to life and other people
- Problems become opportunities for growth
- You experience deep contentment regardless of external circumstances

## Making This Journey Practical 🛤️

### Daily Steps for Any Stage

**For Stage One Seekers:**
- Practice mindfulness during routine activities (washing dishes, walking, eating)
- Take regular breaks from technology and mental stimulation
- Spend time in nature without agenda
- Practice deep breathing when you feel stressed
- Notice moments when you feel truly peaceful and remember them

**For Stage Two Developers:**
- Establish consistent daily practices that center you
- Learn to pause before reacting emotionally
- Practice acceptance of things you cannot change
- Develop your ability to observe your thoughts without being controlled by them
- Cultivate patience and compassion toward yourself and others
- Create space for solitude and reflection in your schedule

**For Stage Three Integration:**
- Focus on embodying peace in daily interactions
- Practice unconditional acceptance of what is
- Share your wisdom through example rather than preaching
- Remain humble and open to continued growth
- Help others find their own path to inner freedom

## The Timeless Nature of This Journey 🕰️

These stages of development aren't tied to any particular era or culture. Whether we're living in 2025 or 2425, human beings will still experience stress, seek meaning, and long for inner peace. The external world may change dramatically, but the inner landscape of consciousness remains remarkably consistent across time and cultures.

### Why This Matters for Future Generations

Four hundred years from now, people will still:
- Feel overwhelmed by life's demands
- Search for meaning and purpose
- Want to feel connected and peaceful
- Struggle with reactive emotions
- Seek authentic relationships
- Long for a sense of belonging

The technology may be unrecognizable, the social structures completely different, but the human heart and mind will still seek the same fundamental peace and understanding.

## Your Personal Journey Starts Now 🚀

### Small Steps, Big Changes

You don't need to wait for perfect conditions or have any special qualifications to begin this journey. It starts with simple awareness and grows through consistent practice.

**This Week, Try:**
- Taking three conscious breaths before checking your phone
- Spending five minutes in complete silence each day
- Noticing one beautiful thing in nature
- Pausing before responding when someone irritates you
- Practicing gratitude for something simple and ordinary

**This Month, Develop:**
- A regular time for quiet reflection
- Better boundaries around energy-draining activities
- More mindful eating, walking, and listening habits
- The ability to catch yourself before reacting emotionally
- Deeper appreciation for present-moment experiences

**This Year, Cultivate:**
- Genuine inner peace that doesn't depend on external circumstances
- Wisdom that guides your decisions and relationships
- Compassion for yourself and others during difficult times
- The ability to find meaning and beauty in ordinary moments
- A sense of connection to something larger than your personal concerns

## The Ripple Effect 💫

As you progress through these stages, something beautiful happens – your transformation naturally affects everyone around you. You become calmer in tense situations, more patient with difficult people, and more present in your relationships. This isn't something you force; it happens naturally as you develop inner stability.

Your family notices you're less reactive. Your coworkers see that you handle stress differently. Your friends observe that you're more genuinely interested in them and less caught up in drama. Children especially pick up on this kind of authentic presence and feel safer around you.

## Remember: It's a Journey, Not a Destination 🌈

These stages aren't achievements to collect or boxes to check off. They're more like deepening experiences of what it means to be fully human. Some days you might feel like you're in stage three, other days you might feel like you're back at the beginning – and that's completely normal.

The key is to approach this journey with curiosity rather than pressure, compassion rather than criticism, and patience rather than urgency. Every moment of awareness, every conscious breath, every pause before reacting is valuable progress.

Your life is happening right now, in this moment. The peace you seek isn't somewhere else or some other time – it's available right here, right now, in the midst of whatever you're experiencing.

The journey to inner freedom is the most practical adventure you can embark upon because it transforms everything else. When you change from the inside out, your entire world changes with you.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. The path to lasting peace and authentic happiness begins with your very next breath. 🌟

1n32fek,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1n32fek/vitamins/,Vitamins,"Im not asking for medical advice just for personal opinions on what you would do. Im not sure if I can post this here, but since it spefically had to do with dreams I figured id give it a shot. 

Ok so as far as trigger warnings go, I wont go into detail just know there are definitely some sensitive topics. So TW for trauma, Wars, crime, and violence. 

So I've recently figured out that vitamins make dreams clearer to the point where i remember them vividly. I like my vitamins and they help balance out my body, and other than my dreams they improve my quality of life. They are not a life or death medication more like the medical equivalent to coffee. You can go without it, but you wont be fully focused if you dont drink it. My question is do I keep taking the vitamins. They are not officially prescribed by a doctor. Theyre just over the counter multivitamins that my doctor knows i take. 

My dreams aren't causing me any major distress but they are a tad traumatizing. 
Dreams ive had 

I lived in Poland in 1939

Got stuck in the woods with the nco that constantly harassed my while I was in the military and in the dream he wouldnt let me call home. (No one knew we were alive) this was after an Anastasia type train crash in tge dream

Another dream i got forced into doing an obstacle course that my nco from tge military had setup and it was so hard that some soldiers were throwing themselves over the staircases to unalive themselves

Another dream I was kidnapped and trafficked. 

There was a dream where I cheated on my current husband with my exhusband
ex-husband

In two or three other dreams there was a mass shooting.

Another was kind of a fake friends destroy my dress in public cinderella type dream.

Yet another I was abandoned in the ozarks and had to make my way to Washington state. 

Another i almost drowned at a lake

Another one a patient at an old folks home went missing, we did find her on the way back in she fell and broke her hip.

Those were all within the last two months.

There have been others that have stood out but the one I remember the clearest was 4 years ago and in that dream I was in afghanistan (ive never deployed) I was in a hmmwv with an nco when we drove over an ied. 

Hopefully none of that is detailed enough to traumatize or trigger you, and i mean that in the most sincere way possible. None of my dreams contain anything that happened to me in real life. Its all made up in my head. 

My question for you is would you continue to take the vitamins because the pros outweigh the cons, or quit taking them damn the consequences.

Hybrids  
  
**Capi (Capybara Hybrid)**  
Capi, is a capybara hybrid with the body of a human and the head of a capybara. He has already gone through The Turning, and has volunteered to act as both mentor and older sibling to the younger changelings.  
Core Traits: Calm, steady, big-hearted. He is patient even when teased, and rarely loses his temper. He’d rather defuse tension than escalate it.  
Strengths: Natural peacemaker. Loyal. Listens more than he speaks, but when he does speak, it’s worth hearing. Animals (and humans) instinctively trust him.  
Flaws: He can be stubbornly passive — avoiding conflict when action is needed. He sometimes doubts whether he is truly a leader, or just “the safe one.”  
Habits: Loves sitting near, or in water (ponds, fountains, hydro-domes). Has a habit of chewing on berries or reeds while talking. Tends to call the other teens “changelings” affectionately.  
Way of speaking: Slow, even rhythm — like he’s unhurried. Warm humour, with the occasional dry bite. When serious, his voice deepens and quiets, drawing people in.  
Secret Fears: That the Turning will split the group apart. That one day, his calming presence won’t be enough to keep the peace.  
Clothes: Loose, practical, slightly rumpled — hoodies, cargo shorts, and sandals. Always looks like he’s dressed for lounging by a pool, not running from danger.  
Body: Human frame — broad-shouldered, strong but not ripped, with a natural heaviness that makes him look dependable.  He often carries snacks or berries in a pocket. His movements are unhurried, deliberate, but he can be surprisingly quick when someone’s in trouble.  There’s something grounding about him — like standing next to a warm stone. People instinctively feel safer when he’s around.  
  
**Teens (Changelings)**  
*Nyla Rahman - The Musical One*  
Personality now: Bright, talkative, swears a lot, loves music, always humming, drumming on tables, making echoes in tunnels. Often teased for being “too noisy.”  
Foreshadowing moment: She plays in the empty hydroponic domes because her voice echoes perfectly — one day, her song sets off a chain reaction of bioluminescent plants glowing.  
Hybrid destiny: Bat - tuned to sound waves, with echolocation or piercing calls, ability to navigate even where there is no light.  
Catchphrase: “If they are listening… might as well give them a song.”  
  
*Dante Kowalski – The Quiet Engineer*  
Personality now: Tough exterior, acts cool, but secretly sketches bugs, beetles, and crawling things. Has a knack for fixing things, solving puzzles and repurposing things from scrap.  Very scared of females.  
Foreshadowing moment: He notices details others miss. He spends hours tinkering in the colony’s maintenance shafts, where the smaller kids refuse to go because of “creepy crawlies.” He’s the one who knows how to reroute the vents or find a way through cracks.  
Hybrid Destiny: Mantis — agile, precise, strategic.  
Catchphrase: “Everything’s got a hidden mechanism… you’ve just got to find it.”  
  
**Bots**  
**Barista Bot**   
  
Friendly and functional, obsessed with recreating proper coffee.  A good listener, who keeps secrets.  
  
**Cute Bot**  
  
Very nervous.  Knows more than he is letting on.  Not sure if keeping “organics” around is a good idea.  
  
  
  
Secondary Characters  
  
So many!    
  
Ship AI  
  
The ship is all. Feels there is a part of her that is missing (she was split to run the colony, but is also on the ark - somewhere.  It has made her a bit schizophrenAIc.  Misses the Keepers, and is full of remorse, and anger in turns.  Knows more about things that happen on the colony, and in the portals than most.  But can’t understand humans or hybrids at all.  Deeply regrets jettisoning the coffee beans.  
  
Portal AI  
Something is wrong with portal AI.  She thinks she can “fix” the DNA hybrid mix, if she could just do a bit of disassembling. One to watch.  
  
Nurse Bot  
  
Caring and protective of all “organics”, especially the younger ones.

1n32ekn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n32ekn/why_choose_the_waterdrop_wdpf01a_pitcher_filter/,Why Choose the Waterdrop WD-PF-01A Pitcher Filter Replacement Review for Pure Water?,"Personal experience has taught me that water filtration systems can make or break the essence of what you drink. When I tested the Waterdrop WD-PF-01A Replacement Filter, I was intrigued by its bold claim to reduce PFAS, chlorine, and other impurities for up to 200 gallons. Using it daily, it became a reliable companion in my pursuit of purer, healthier water. That said, while it performed admirably, there are some details worth sharing for those interested in making an informed decision.

**Design and Compatibility Matter**

Fitting the filter into my existing Waterdrop pitcher system was a breeze, which is thanks to its compatibility with models such as WD-PT-05, WD-PT-07, and others. With a sleek, compact design of only 8.07 x 3.46 x 5.51 inches, it was hardly noticeable but packed quite a punch. This filter incorporates modern technology upgrades while maintaining a lightweight build of just 1.16 pounds. It felt sturdy yet lightweight—a perfect combination. 

**[Looking for Waterdrop WD-PF-01A deals on Amazon now.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b086zpr3wm/)**

**Effective Filtration That Lives Up to Expectations**

I was particularly impressed with how it handled impurities. Using multi-stage pitcher filtration, the filter eliminated noticeable contaminants like chlorine, bad odors, and even the metallic taste some tap water carries. It’s peace of mind knowing this was validated by third-party laboratory testing. Family members who usually avoid tap water were pleasantly surprised by the smooth and fresh taste they experienced. However, if like me you regularly deal with hard water, results may slightly vary.

**Superior Absorption Technology**

Equipped with advanced ACF (activated carbon fiber), the absorption capabilities seemed extraordinary. According to product details, this technology promises 10 times better absorption than most standard filters. I noticed it cleared out common pollutants faster, even during busy mornings when my coffee pot, water bottles, and cooking needs demanded constant filtered water. It’s fascinating how the Japanese technology at its core streamlined the process without compromising quality.

**Durability and Longevity**

Water filters typically drain your wallet due to frequent replacements, but this was where this product made an impression. With its capacity to filter up to 200 gallons, I saved significant money compared to standard 16 oz water bottles. On top of that, the reduction in plastic waste proved to be an eco-friendly bonus. It’s a win-win for anyone seeking a balance between affordability and sustainability.

**Efficiency in Flow Rate**

Nothing frustrates me more than waiting for an eternity just to fill a single jug of water. With the funnel-like speed of 0.4 gpm (gallons per minute), the convenience was top-notch. Whether refilling during post-workout dehydration or prepping my kid’s lunch boxes, the filter never slowed me down. However, while the flow was commendable, I would occasionally spot tiny air pockets during installation, though they dissipated quickly with use.

**Pluses**

- Robust filtration targeting PFAS, arsenic, and fluoride.  
- High absorption rate enhanced by Japanese ACF technology.  
- Consistent longevity reduces the need for replacements, saving money.  

**Hurdles**

- Users with heavily mineralized water might find marginal differences.  
- Occasionally, initial water passes leave translucency until fully primed.  

**Competing Products**

There’s no shortage of competing replacement filters in the market. Brita filters, for instance, have long been a household name with similar filtration models. While Brita excels in tackling odor and chlorine, it doesn’t specifically target PFAS reduction like this one does. PUR filters are another strong contender, boasting specialized capabilities for heavy metal reduction. However, PUR’s slower flow rates can be a deal-breaker if time is of the essence. Where the WD-PF-01A shines is by blending affordability, speed, and comprehensive effectiveness seamlessly.

**Affordable Quality**

Budget-friendly products this effective are worth noting, given they bridge quality with reasonable pricing. While the initial investment may feel similar to competitors, realizing just how much long-term savings you achieve through its extended lifespan is rewarding. Considering the combination of functionality, eco-conscious benefits, and how easy it is to pop into compatible pitchers, I genuinely felt this product paid for itself over time.

Date [Standardised human time]: 6 April, 2138

""And that's why I want to help. After everything that happened with the Federation, it changed my perspective on everything, the Arxur included."" Targan had listened intently as I explained about the lone Arxur fighter. I had left out what happened after our initial encounter, as I wanted the story to have a positive spin. Once we had reached the evac ships, the fighter was shot down by a pack of additional Arxur vessels during our escape from the Cradle. I never even knew the man's name, I was too terrified to ask at the time.

Targan hadn't said anything, she just stared at the window I spoke. I let her contemplate what I had said, returning to the kitchen and filling a pair of glasses with water, adding a little fruit syrup to flavour mine. I set the water on the coffee table beside my Arxur roommate and gave a happy tail swish.

""That...is a good reason..."" She admitted, taking the glass and swallowing a mouthful of water. ""What happened to the fighter pilot?""

""He...he died protecting us from his own, I know he managed to shoot down at least one additional bomber before some more fighters..."" I took a deep breath as I recalled the Arxur ship falling from the sky, he had taken too much damage and opted to ram into his murderer. The two fighter craft slammed into each other in such a way that they were steered away from the evac zone, his final act was to protect us... 
""At the time I thought it was 'predator trickery' but Wes soon got me thinking otherwise, I truly wish he could have survived to see all that has happened since.""

""He wouldn't have. Even if he made it off the Cradle, Betterment would have him executed as a sympathiser."" Targan said grimly, looking back to the window and loosing herself in the permanent-evening skyline. 

""What about you? Do you...I don't know, have any stories of going against the regime? Grand acts of defiance?"" I prodded, I wouldn't expect anything but it kept the conversation going at least.

""No...those that do anything like that were killed, either immediately or shortly afterwards."" She then took another long drink from her water. ""Tell me about something else, you said you had siblings? What are they like?""

""Oh! I would love to! I have seven sisters, my mother and father and grandmother Tanna!"" I tried not to get too excited, feeling my tail start waving unintentionally. ""I was the only boy amongst my siblings, meaning I was resigned to an eternity of plush toys and family drama. I'm joking but I love my sisters more than anything, especially as their older brother!"" 

""And the Venlil raise their own offspring, how unfortunate for your family to have so many to feed..."" Targan grumbled, I chose to ignore her pessimism and continued on.

""I'm sure you'd love them! They could wear down even the most hateful of Arxur I'm sure of it. Then there's mother and father, they're about what you'd expect. They took some time to come around to Wes but once they saw how he was with the girls, they were convinced. Then grandma Tenna...mother's own mother...""

""I suppose she's what one would expect of an old Federation Venlil hmm?"" She had guessed right, grandma Tenna hasn't spoken to me ever since the exchange...

My tail drooped as I recalled the last time I'd seen my grandmother, she'd screamed about me trying to get myself killed and that I was a damned fool for joining the program. I sighed and finished my drink before realising my face had become slightly damp. I wasn't the one who was supposed to cry here...

""S-sorry g-give me a minute..."" I turned away and taking a few deep breaths to calm myself. I was supposed to be helping Targan with her emotions, not getting all caught up in my own. But I...

I felt a scaled hand touch my cheek, wiping the tears away and pulling my snout to face the Arxur. She had an unreadable expression, though I could almost swear it showed...sympathy. Was she trying to comfort me? The moment passed as Targan hung her head in shame, seemingly disappointed in herself. Why did she-?

""Let me know when food is ready..."" The Arxur then hurried to hide herself in the spare bedroom, slamming the door behind her. Maybe she was embarrassed?

I took a deep breath and sat on the sofa, allowing myself to melt into the soft cushions. My mind wandered for a few moments before settling back on my sisters, causing me to realise that I had yet to inform them of how meeting my new exchange partner had gone. I promptly jumped to my feet and grabbed hold of my phone, noting that I had received a voice message. I was too focused on helping Targan to check regularly...

""Niv, it's Anvar. Just a heads up, we'll all be coming over at *4pm human time* like we agreed. See you soon!"" My eldest sister's voice made my tail stand on end. I had completely forgotten, my sisters would all be coming to visit for dinner with me and Wes!

""It's four now!"" My eyes went wide as I saw the human clock. Immediately followed by a knock on the door, right on que. ""Fuck!""",9,1756458389.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

1n32e00,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1n32e00/reveal_the_best_electric_kettle_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Electric Kettle Experience with Aarke Kettle Review,"When I first unboxed the Aarke 1244, I was struck by its minimalist yet sophisticated stainless steel design. It felt hefty in a reassuring way, as though it was built to last. I’ve used it every day for the past few weeks to make tea, coffee, and even to warm water for instant soups. Honestly, this kettle stands out not just for its style but also for its performance. However, as much as I appreciated its sleek look and practical features, some quirks left me scratching my head.

**Strengths**

The product comes with a lot of points in its favor, and I’ve enjoyed exploring each one during my daily use.

- The non-drip spout ensures that pouring is a breeze. It sounds trivial, but if you've ever tried to sneak in a quiet midnight tea without making a mess, you’ll understand how important this is.  
- A favorite feature of mine is the double-wall construction. Not only does the exterior stay relatively cool to the touch, but it also retains heat remarkably well, keeping my water hot for longer stretches.  
- Dry boil protection is invaluable. I’ve admittedly forgotten a few times that I had no water in it, but it automatically shuts off, a feature particularly handy if you’re like me and tend to multitask.  

Let me pause here, though, because there’s more to uncover about this kettle.  

[Want the lowest price for Aarke 1244? Click to check on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b0cwhk6xzp/)  

**Design That Blends Into Any Kitchen**

I will give credit where it is due—the kettle nails the aesthetics game. Crafted from stainless steel, it boasts a clean, polished look that makes it suitable for just about any kitchen, whether modern or rustic. The size is compact for a 1.2-liter kettle, fitting snugly into my small countertop space without making it look overcrowded. Even the 360° swivel base is thoughtfully designed, offering easy repositioning without any awkward plugging or unplugging.  

**Performance and Heating Time**

In terms of heating performance, the Aarke kettle delivers consistent results. Every test I carried out, from a half-full kettle to max capacity, boiled water in a few minutes. Comparatively, it’s quieter than many other electric options I've used in the past, thanks to the double-wall feature that dampens the noise. I even timed the boiling duration against an older model I own, and this one shaved off a solid minute—nothing groundbreaking, but noticeable.  

**Areas for Improvement**

That said, a few areas left me wanting more from this otherwise great kettle.

- I wish the lid’s opening was designed to be automatic rather than manual. It’s not a dealbreaker but feels like an oversight when everything else is so intuitive.  
- The item weighs over five pounds, which adds to its longevity, but it can be a touch annoying if you need to move it around frequently.  
- The manual-only design might not appeal to users accustomed to touch panels or preset buttons on other kettles.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing the Aarke 1244 to something like a Cuisinart or Breville electric kettle unveiled some telling contrasts. While Aarke wins in the department of minimalist aesthetics and energy efficiency, other brands provide more advanced features such as temperature settings for different types of tea or coffee. Personally, I didn’t find this to be a huge limitation since I mostly need water boiled evenly, but if you’re a green tea enthusiast, that might be a missed feature for you.  

On the efficiency scale, however, the double-wall technology gives the product a slight edge, particularly when compared to single-walled alternatives. It’s quieter, more energy-efficient, and cools down slower, which can be a decisive factor for many.  

**Bang for the Buck**

As for its cost, I’d say it offers fair value considering its durability, performance, and elegant design. The Aarke 1244 feels premium, and that’s rare for kitchen appliances at this tier. If you value minimalism and practicality over a slew of unnecessary add-ons, this product might justify its price point. On the flip side, budget buyers might find better deals in less stylish options.

What it does: The app gives you daily challenges designed to push you outside your comfort zone in small, manageable ways. Think:

Ask a stranger for their opinion on      something

Lie down on the floor in a public setting like a cafe for 30 seconds

Give a genuine compliment to someone you don’t know

Ask for a 10% discount at a coffee shop (you don’t need to get it, just ask)

Current features: Daily personalized challenges based on your comfort level

Ongoing challenges (like “take 5 cold showers this week”)

XP system for completing tasks

Science backed reasonings for the why each challenge

What I’m wondering:

Would you actually use something like this? Why/why not?

I have a working prototype already, but want to make sure I’m building something people actually want before polishing it up. Not promoting just looking for advice!

3 Days in Uluwatu, 4 days in Ubud, 2 Days Lombok, 2 Days Gilli, 2 Days Nusa Islands 

The budget that we've set for these two weeks is around $2000 USD including accomodation. Here's where i need your advice 

1) Does the itenary look solid or are we trying to cover too much, i wanted to add amed or sideman too, are these places worth going. if yes, let me know how should i change my itinerary 

2) Is the budget enough for two people for two weeks, for context right now our accommodation in uluwatu and ubud that we've booked so far cost us around $200 USD for 7 nights so my guess is it should be good. 

3)I know we can't have best of both worlds but i would really love your suggestion on a few stays/hotels in above location which have good views and cost around 30-40 USD

4) for food, i've allocated us a budget of around 500 USD. This is based off of the best reviewed places in these locations (My idea is one time meal for two shouldn't cost more than 250k combined, we do not drink) 

5) For activities: Please suggest some of the best places to visit and some of the things to do, so far we've only finalized snorkeling and ATV. Suggest waterfalls, picturesque cafes, best coffee plantations etc 

6) Me and wife are planning to do some cloth shopping from there and we might stay inseminiyak for one night right when we land, can you suggest some places or markets to get affordable clothing? 

  
Finally, any suggestions or advice. We're looking to have the time of our lives while staying in our budget constraints to any tips would be helpful.

So its been a while since i have dizziness and lightheadnes and it all started while i was having a coffee at work. I used to consume coffee daily and smoker for 4 yrs. As soon as i drank that coffee just like any other day i got a hit in the head and became dizzy and such. I was feeling down and maybe thought it was summer hotness and me not eating and stuff so i took care of that, started eating regurarly and keeping myself hydrated. When i was on vacation at the beach i had no problem with the coffee and could drink it meanwhile in my town no. Sometimes the dizzines goes away and sometimes its here. Its been a month and a half or so i dont remember quite well. Last week i just woke up and my vision wasnt focused and my forehead hurting, thought maybe dryness since i work in front of computer and tried artificial tears and first time worked but even now its a bit problematic but not like in the first day. And 3 days ago it was midnight just got home, i climbed the stairs fast two times and my heartbeat shot up and couldnt sleep till like 4 am. After that till today i can sleep good on right side i can feel sth in my chest. I made some blood tests yesterday and the only thing im not sufficent on is D3 vitamin which is a bit lower than the range( i had 28 range was 30-100) and from my research this doesnt explain the dizziness and all these things happening to me, electrolytes were fine iron fine only thing missing is b12 that im still waiting. Idk if its in my head but my right ear feels like it makes some noise. At this point ive become paranoid

Please, i know its a long read but it would be appriciated if someone could help me or give me any kind of suggestion coz this is not normal, i havent felt normal since that first ocurrence.",1,1756458137.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

Chapter 32: Scouts.

Twelve days after the parade that had united the world in pride, Admiral Marcus Thorne allowed himself a rare luxury – five minutes of peace. He sat in his spacious, minimalist office in the heart of the Guard's command, a mug of hot, black coffee in his hands. Beyond the armored glass of his window stretched the view of the Mojave Desert, but he was looking somewhere further, into the void. He was thinking about the battleship designs he was currently analyzing, about logistics, about the relentlessly ticking clock. This was his world. Calm, controlled pressure.
This silence was shattered with explosive brutality.
The door to his office flew open with a bang, and a young Guard lieutenant, a communications officer from the long-range observation center, burst in. His uniform was immaculate, but his face was as pale as paper, and a primal, undisguised terror lurked in his eyes.
Marcus set the mug down with a soft click. The time for relaxation was over. His voice was as cold and sharp as a shard of ice. ""Report, soldier!""
""Sir... Admiral, sir!"" the lieutenant stammered, trying to catch his breath. ""The 'Eye of the Swarm' early warning system has detected... an object... two alien signals on the edge of the Solar System! In the Kuiper Belt! Their energy signatures... their structure is different from the Swarm ships! They are approximately 160 meters long and about 23 meters wide.""
Marcus Thorne didn't flinch. He thought, 160 meters long, according to the intelligence the Swarm provided, that means Plague frigates, some of the smaller ships in their fleet. He showed no surprise or fear. They had sent a small reconnaissance, a scouting party. He had expected this and had spoken of it when he talked with the Secretary and when he approved the costly 'Eye of the Swarm' project—a system of hundreds of sensors scattered throughout the solar system—over a year ago. Only a look of grim confirmation appeared on his face. His intuition, his worst-case scenario, was materializing. He rose slowly from behind his desk, his presence seeming to fill the entire room.
""They have arrived,"" he said in a quiet, deathly calm voice. ""It's the reptiles. The Plague, soldier.""
The lieutenant stared at him with his mouth agape. The Admiral walked over to his console and slammed a large, red button. Throughout the complex, and via the quantum network completed just five months ago, in every Guard base in the Solar System, a piercing combat alarm sounded.
""Combat alarm for the entire System!"" he commanded, and his voice was no longer quiet. It was the voice of a commander in a time of trial, hard and tolerating no dissent. ""Go to immediate readiness status!""
He turned back to the stunned lieutenant and began issuing orders with the speed of a tactical computer. ""Connect me immediately with the captains of the four destroyers patrolling the Outer Sector: the 'Piast', the 'Jagiellończyk', the 'Gryf', and the 'Lóng'!""
His fingers were already tapping commands on the screen. ""Relay an order to the cruiser 'Ivan the Terrible'! It is to fire up its engines in combat mode and move towards them! Full power!""
He looked the lieutenant straight in the eye, his gaze as hard as a diamond. ""Transmit the mission to Strike Group 'Spear': they are to intercept these two targets at all costs. Identify and neutralize. Neither of them is to send a return signal. Do you understand, soldier? At all costs.""
The lieutenant, shaken but motivated by the admiral's iron will, snapped to attention. ""Yes, Admiral!""
As the officer ran out of the office to see to the orders, Marcus Thorne glanced at his coffee mug. The drink had already gone cold. Admiral Marcus whispered, ""And so, the game is over.""
His mind always prepared for the worst. The intelligence data from the Swarm on the reptilian race didn't mention if they possessed quantum communication—the kind that bypasses distance and time. It was an unknown for the Swarm, and for him. But his character and experience told him that the solar system was already served on a platter. Even if they managed to destroy the two scout ships, information about the skirmish, and perhaps even a live feed, would be transmitted to their main fleet. The peace had come to an end, and the defense of the seven worlds had, for now, taken a backseat in this theater called the war for survival.
The war, to which we were supposed to send volunteers to defend the seven worlds in thirty-eight years, had just knocked on our door.

I’m terrified off a lot of things but love the feeling of getting out my comfort zone and the growth that comes with. So I’m developing a mobile app and want to gauge interest before diving deeper into development.

What it does:
The app gives you daily challenges designed to push you outside your comfort zone in small, manageable ways. Think:

Ask a stranger for their opinion on      something

Lie down on the floor in a public setting like a cafe for 30 seconds

Give a genuine compliment to someone you don’t know

Ask for a 10% discount at a coffee shop (you don’t need to get it, just ask)

Current features:
Daily personalized challenges based on your comfort level

Ongoing challenges (like “take 5 cold showers this week”)

XP system for completing tasks

Science backed reasonings for the why each challenge

What I’m wondering:

Would you actually use something like this? Why/why not?

I have a working prototype already, but want to make sure I’m building something people actually want before polishing it up. Let me know if you want to join the waitlist as I’m trying to validate if people would use this

TL;DR: App that gives you daily “uncomfortable” challenges to build confidence. Would you use it?

Among immigrants with modest jobs or fewer resources, there’s often a remarkable dedication to learning Portuguese, even when it’s hard, even when life is already heavy. You see people going to night classes, practicing with neighbors, making mistakes and laughing at themselves. It’s actually inspiring.

But among those with comfortable salaries, remote jobs, “global” positions… suddenly Portuguese becomes optional. Why bother, right? Ordering a coffee in English works just fine in Lisbon.

I say this as an immigrant myself. I’m Brazilian, so I had the advantage of already speaking Portuguese. Even so, I make the effort to adapt to the European variant, out of respect. I also speak Spanish and English, and my wife adds French to the mix. Meanwhile, most Portuguese under 45 are bilingual, if not polyglots.

So why is it that the expat crowd with better incomes and privileges often shows the least interest in learning the local language? Convenience? Entitlement? Or maybe they just assume Portugal should adapt to them?

I had a BMI of over 70 and I knew if I didn't sort myself out my weight would kill me.

I have always been obese, I did sliming world and weight watchers since age 12. I have lost weight before (always up to 4 months) would make massive progress (50lbs+ drop) then I'd fail and regain the weight.

I had booked a trip to theme park a year and a bit in advance (Disney and universal). when I went to universal last around 350lbs I hardly fit on anything. this was a lot of money for me to book coming from the UK.

  
So 1st September 2024 I began calorie counting. I set myself a target of 1750 calories a day but I also promised to be honest with myself. If I had a bad day and went over that was OK as long as I logged it. this helped me see the bigger picture as before I'd have a bad day and that would cause me to spiral and diet to fail. By taking this approach I was able to see my monthly/weekly calories and see how just having a 'bad' day every now and then was ok as it all balanced out overall provided I kept tracking and got back on track.

In November 2024 I hit a platue for a month and given my size I wasn't pleased about hitting it so early into my journey so in December 2024 I started Mounjaro alongside counting and the scales have kept moving since. 

I have not been perfect at all, I've sometimes had months were I've had 3 'bad' weekends in it due to parties or being on holiday. but I've always logged no matter what (almost got the 365 day streak on my app).

  
I also implemented weighing every Friday and after weighing, no matter the results, taking myself out for a coffee as a treat. I want to keep doing this even after I've finished my journey so I can make sure my weight doesn't spiral. 

Now for the results:

SW 419

CW 273lbs 

  
Previous BMI - 71.9

Current BMI - 46.9

  
Measurements 

SW Hips - 63

CW hips - 49

  
SW waist - 55

CW waist - 38

  
Future plans and thoughts

  
So I'd like to lose as much weight as possible pre-holiday and just carry on as I am.

During my 2 week holiday I'm gonna log 4k calories on my app per day to make sure I don't lose my streak as I've learnt I'm very number motivated and then get back on track when its finished.

My current thing I'm struggling with is setting a goal weight as I think I have quite a bit of muscle for carrying so much weight from being SMO basically since childhood. I'd love to hear peoples thoughts and experience in this area.

  
But yeah sort of just did this as a post of my experience and things that have helped me.

  
Another piece of advice I'll give - it doesn't matter what you eat on your holiday, it matters what you eat between you're holiday and the next.

🛡️ 11 new scenarios — including the Endgame storyline + a fresh Spider-Man arc, plus the final missing Avengers (Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, Wasp).
✨ 8 new Hero Ultimates — enhanced powers + rebalanced older ones.
🏆 Achievements upgraded — Stars now unlock campaign bonuses.
⚙️ Rebalanced mechanics — 1 Star revives KO heroes, scenarios fine-tuned.
🕵️ New Level 10 Clearance Dossier content — tougher missions await.

This update marks a big milestone — I’ve woven in nearly 90% of Season 1 content! MCUL now has over 40 scenarios and more than 50 hero ultimates. From here, I’ll be focusing more on playing the campaign (finally with my wife 😊), though there are seeds for Phase 5 if it comes: finishing open branches, secret scenarios, deeper into the Multiverse… maybe even Fantastic Four.

1n328bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n328bj/cant_stop_hating_myself_over_my_mistakes/,Can’t stop hating myself over my mistakes.,"Bear with me, I know it’s long.

So about 3 years ago I met this girl in high school during junior year, she was in my chemistry class and seemed very cute, but didn’t think much of it since I thought she was out of my league. One day we have a chem lab together and get randomly chosen as partners and immediately hit it off. She starts complementing me and teasing me about how I’m always asleep in class, but smart. After that we talk almost everyday in class and in the parking lot after class. Not much happens but just talking for the rest of junior year, and we stop talking when summer rolls around and didn’t exchange contact info. Fast forward to senior year and we didn’t have any classes together in the fall, but still parked close by so we talked a bit. Around football season we start talking a lot at the games and hanging out after. Things get closer between us and homecoming comes around and she asks me if I was going with anybody and I said no. I get the courage to ask her to homecoming and we go and have a great time, picked her up, took pictures, went to eat together, met her parents. Overall a great time but nothing intimate. After that we go to separate parties after homecoming.

Now a little context to this next part because this is where I fucked up. I had this friend who I considered a best friend since middle school. He was a good friend, but always boasted about how he always talked to girls and having girlfriends. I at the time, hadn’t dated anyone since middle school, so pretty much never, would always get mad and jealous that he got to experience those things and I didn’t. That he always had a girl and sex, and I didn’t. So when I started talking to this girl, I lied. I lied about how close we where, how often we hung out, and to the point where I lied about have sex with her. I know, I know, I was an idiot. I kept this act since the end of junior year and didn’t want to feel left out since we also had this friend group and they too had all the experiences, girlfriends, sex, but me. I only told him and always told him to “keep it a secret” because i told him nobody knew, when in reality i was lying out my ass. 

So literally the day after homecoming, which was on a Friday, she finds out. My best friend had asked her best friend what we did after homecoming and she was confused since we didn’t do much after, he then spills the beans and tells her all the lies I told him. After that we don’t speak again. No fighting or confrontation, but just complete silence between us, 

Spring rolls around and no shit we have a class together. It was horrible, I dreaded going to that class since she and all her friends were in there and knew what I did last semester. Throughout the semester we start talking a little again, but surprisingly neither of us bring up what I did last semester. It was only small things like sometimes I would text her to get my computer from a class I intentionally left it in so she could get it and I could talk to her for a minute or 2. It stays like that until the end of the year and graduation rolls around. I throughout the spring wanted to talk to her and apologize for what I did, but I was too scared to do it. At graduation I told myself I would talk to her 1 last time and tell her everything, how I felt about her and apologize to her so I could move on. I walk up to her while she’s taking picture to with her friends and family. I see her dad and he recognized me, shakes my hand and tell me congratulations on graduating. I say thanks and tell her if I could talk to her for 5 minutes, she said yes after she’s done taking pics. I walk to my car and wait, and wait, and wait. After about 10 minutes I send her a text to let me know when she’s done, and wait, and wait, and nothing. I left after waiting about 30 minutes hoping she would respond and she didn’t. So after that I go to my friends lake house and we all get drunk and celebrate. Sometime through the night she sends me a text, “hey I didn’t see you leaving, but if you need something you can call me later tonight” I felt devastated. I get drunk that night and my friends tells me the next morning that they found me in a guest room sobbing over her. After I got that text I didn’t text her back or have talked to her since. This was also the time I stopped talking to my best friend. Haven’t talked to him since.

This was all in the summer of 2024, we haven’t spoken since, and until about the beginning of this year, I thought of her and sometimes cried over her still. I wanted to be with her. I’ve tried dating ever since then, even while in college, but every time i do I think of her and can’t see myself being with anyone for the rest of my life. I was doing good about myself and started to forget her about the start of summer this year, things were going good for me. About mid July my family goes out to eat with my brother girlfriends family to celebrate her birthday. On the way home my brother asks me if he can pick up an ice cream cake he ordered from an ice cream shop about 30 minutes from our city since she lived there and he ordered it at that location. I go and walk up to the front and tell the guy at the register I have a cake to pick up, he walks out and out the corner of my eye I see her for the first time in a year. My heart dropped and everything came rushing back to me. My face got hot, I started to shake, I felt nauseous. He eventually brings out the cake and presents it to me and while I’m looking at it I could see in the corner of my eye her looking at me. I take the cake leave and don’t say or look at her. Ever since that interaction I’ve relapsed back into the same way I was. 

I don’t know what to do, I know it was my fault and I hate myself for it. I don’t blame my best friend either since it was my fault in the first place for lying. For the past year and recently 2 months, I’ve been trying to build the courage to text her and see if she would like to meet and have lunch or coffee so I could tell her how I felt and apologize. I mainly have been wanting to do this so I could find out if she ever liked me as well, and to finally bury this and move on with my life. I mainly stayed far from that idea since she had gotten into a relationship while in college, but recently found out it ended about the same time I saw her in over a year. What do I do ? I just want to move on and forget about her, but for some reason anytime I feel a connection with another girl or find myself in a relationship I always think of her. I love her and want her to be happy, but sometimes i think it’s stupid that I love someone I never dated. We’re both in college now, but go to different ones that are about 30 minutes away and still live at home. I’m struggling in my classes and my social life is going down the drain over some girl who I don’t even talk to anymore. If you read this entire thing, thank you.

Over the past few months we’ve been arguing more and more and i’ve been between leaving him and trying to make it work. He doesn’t do anything majorly wrong or anything but there’s just a lot of things i have to ask him to do repeatedly and i feel like he doesn’t really compliment me.

We’ve had a few big arguments including him threatening to leave me but i asked him to stay. To preface i have quite a short temper and do get annoyed around him which he starts arguments from HOWEVER this is only in response to when he does something eg makes a snarky comment or says something about what i’m wearing etc.

We argue a lot about money as i am a big spender and have always grown up like that, we’ve just moved back from living in aus and so i understand it’s hard to get back on our feet here but ive already got a job while hes just lazing around. He’s living in my families holiday home a few hours away from my house so i only see him every couple weeks and he doesn’t even have to worry about rent.

A big thing is that he doesn’t comfort me when i’m upset, he’s really terrible with his emotions and i have a bit of anxiety, he’s just sits there or tells me to stop crying but doesn’t comfort me at all.

I feel like now i dont look forward to seeing him as much as i dont really enjoy s.x that much partly due to health issues i have that he is not understanding of and partly due to our bond. We argue quite often and it’s usually a small thing that he’s made bigger and i just end up taking the blame to stop the argument.

We have such amazing moments sometimes and this is my first relationship so i don’t really know how it should be yknow? like my friends are helpful but some say try and make it work and some would say leave him because he hasn’t brought me a gucci bag or something so it’s hard to judge from their advice.

When we togerther he often cooks and cleans and i don’t really have e to ask him to do that it’s more just the verbal and emotional side of things yknow. Like he’s really not big on cuddling.

We don’t really go on dates that often becuase of money but we go on walks and for coffee a lot. I’ve asked him a few times for flowers and he only got them once for valentine’s day.

Idk i guess i’m trying to work out if i’m just with him and settling to not be lonely or if i should leave him work on myself and could find someone better?

TL/DR
Arguing more frequently with my boyfriend over money and asking him to do things repeatedly, should i leave him?

1n321qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1n321qy/when_simplicity_feels_like_the_most_radical_act/,When simplicity feels like the most radical act of self care,"For years I chased bigger routines more structure, more planning, more “productivity”. But each new rule I added just left me feeling more overwhelmed, not accomplished.

So I tried something radically simple: each week, instead of building another system, I chose one tiny habit that felt almost silly to think of as self-care:

* Drinking a full glass of water before coffee
* Taking a full breath before opening my laptop
* Writing one sentence of gratitude at night

These habits were so small that they felt doable, even on the hardest days. Yet over time, they created moments of peace and that felt more meaningful than any checklist or rigid routine.

I remember reading in The Quiet Hustle a short weekly email that progress isn’t about piling on more. It’s about doing less, but with intention. That sentiment has become a soft echo whenever I feel too much pressure to “do it all”.

I’m curious has anyone found a simple habit that unexpectedly brought calm or clarity? I’d love to hear what easy self-care has worked for you.",19,1756457050.0,simpleliving,1,1.0,False

1n31ukb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1n31ukb/i_think_my_boss_is_into_me/,I think my boss is into me?,"Just got to get this off my chest. I (22F) have recently started started a new job. For context I have a boyfriend of 5 years that I very much love. My boss (26M) is a great guy who has quickly become my best friend. He is one of the easiest people to talk to I have ever met, a fantastic mentor, and incredibly similar to me in a way I feel like I've known him all my life. He has a girlfriend of 4 months who recently moved in with him. My bf is fully aware of his behavior and has mentioned he doesn't mind or feel jealous because he finds my boss unattractive and doesn't think I would ever go for him. He told me to take advantage of the benefits.

My boss (I'ma call him W) is known to be very cold, apathetic, and stoic. On my first day, he hardly talked to me. After that, I put significant effort into trying to get to know him by asking insightful questions to understand his motivations, ambitions, etc. This actually made him warm up significantly and soon he began spending long hours even after work talking to me about everything. We are EXTREMELY similar. I feel like we literally mind-read each other, the level of connection is insane. We are playful and tease each other relentlessly at work. He loves to put stickers on me when I am not paying attention, plays small pranks on me at work, and jokes that I am his ""least favorite"" ""ugh I have to work with you again?"". He shares food and drinks with me, gives me his jacket when I get cold, and has told me I am the reason he comes into work every day and that I am the best part of his day. He also has told me he likes my perfume, I have good style, he thinks I am very hygenic, my hair is cute, I have 0 bad features, and that I am given special treatment by most of our coworkers because I am so pretty. He takes me out to eat frequently, brings me pastries/coffee, and every single time he pays for me. He joked once that I am as expensive as his actual gf.

Now here is why I am confused. He asks me for relationship advice constantly. His current gf is expected to be his first long term relationship and he wants to know (I have 5year relationship) what long-term looks like. He talks about his gf like shes a goddess, tells me frequently about how he spoils her, pays for everything, cooks/cleans, plans dates, etc. I've seen their texts, seen pictures of the food he makes her, the google docs of his planned dates, he shows me pictures of them together, etc. He loves doing everything for her in exchange for her presence. He has told me details about how his dream wedding and how he has names picked out for his future children with her. I have never met a man who talks about his partner in such an affectionate way and yet the way he acts around me (correct me if I am wrong) cannot possibly be platonic or professional. 

I so strongly feel like in my bones that he is a good person and yet how can he be such an idealistic partner and be flirting with me so much at the same time? 

Am I an insane narcissist, or is this man in love with me and his gf at the same time? ",2,1756456244.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

As the final rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, I found myself at the edge of the cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The salty breeze carried whispers of a story, and with every breath, I embraced the challenge of crafting an acrostic that encapsulated the essence of my journey.

For a thousand words, I embarked on a reflective exploration, utilizing the initial letters of key words to weave a tapestry of emotions, experiences, and revelations. Each line unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

The Science Behind Effective Oral Hygiene

Research shows that 80% of adults have some form of periodontal disease, often without realizing it. This staggering statistic underscores the importance of a comprehensive teeth routine. Proper oral care isn't just about preventing cavities – it's about maintaining overall health.

*Discovering the profound layers of meaningful relationships in our modern world*

---

## The Challenge of Authentic Connection 💭

In our fast-paced digital age, we often find ourselves navigating relationships that barely scratch the surface. We swipe through profiles, exchange pleasantries, and wonder why something feels missing. The truth is, connecting with another person on multiple levels simultaneously is one of life's most complex yet rewarding challenges.

Think about the people in your life. How many truly *know* you? How many have touched both your mind and your heart? The answer might surprise you.

## Three Levels of Human Connection 🎭

### The Mind Connection: When Ideas Meet 🧠

Some people enter our lives and immediately resonate with our thoughts, our dreams, our intellectual curiosities. These are the friends who can discuss philosophy until 3 AM, who challenge our perspectives, who make us think differently about the world.

**Daily Action Steps:**
- Engage in deeper conversations beyond small talk
- Ask questions that reveal values and beliefs
- Share your authentic thoughts and opinions
- Listen actively to understand, not just to respond

When you connect with someone's mind, you become their mentor, their confidant, their intellectual companion. This person becomes almost divine in their ability to understand your inner world.

### The Physical Connection: Chemistry and Attraction ❤️

Then there are those who create an undeniable physical chemistry. The attraction is immediate, electric, transformative. These connections awaken our senses and remind us of our humanity.

**Daily Action Steps:**
- Practice genuine appreciation for others
- Express affection appropriately and authentically  
- Take care of your physical presence and energy
- Be present in the moment during interactions

This type of connection creates beloved relationships - passionate, intense, and deeply felt. The person becomes your favorite, your desire, your source of excitement.

### The Rare Combination: Complete Understanding 🌈

But what happens when someone manages to connect with both your mind AND your physical being simultaneously? This is where magic happens. This is the rarest form of human connection - one that touches every aspect of who you are.

**Daily Action Steps:**
- Develop both emotional intelligence and physical awareness
- Practice vulnerability in sharing your complete self
- Learn to appreciate others holistically
- Cultivate patience - this level of connection takes time

When someone achieves this dual connection, they transcend ordinary relationships. They become something extraordinary - a perfect companion who understands you completely.

## Why This Matters in Your Daily Life 🏠

### In Romantic Relationships 💑

Understanding these levels helps you recognize what you're seeking in a partner. Are you looking for just physical attraction? Intellectual stimulation? Or that rare combination of both?

**Practical Applications:**
- Date with intention, not just attraction
- Develop yourself intellectually and physically
- Communicate your needs clearly
- Value partners who appreciate your complexity

### In Friendships 🤝

Your friendships can also benefit from this understanding. Some friends are your thinking partners, others are your adventure buddies, and a precious few are both.

**Practical Applications:**
- Nurture different types of friendships
- Don't expect every friend to fulfill every need
- Appreciate the unique gifts each person brings
- Invest more time in multidimensional relationships

### In Professional Relationships 💼

Even in work environments, understanding these connection levels can improve your interactions and career prospects.

**Practical Applications:**
- Build rapport on multiple levels with colleagues
- Appreciate different personality types
- Develop both professional competence and personal likability
- Create meaningful networks, not just transactional ones

## The Modern Challenge: Overcoming Digital Shallowness 📱

Our technology-driven world often encourages superficial connections. We judge based on photos, brief messages, and curated online personas. Breaking through this requires intentional effort.

### Strategies for Deeper Connection:

**In Person Interactions:**
- Put away devices during conversations
- Make eye contact and use open body language
- Ask follow-up questions that show genuine interest
- Share stories that reveal your authentic self

**Digital Communications:**
- Write thoughtful messages instead of quick responses
- Video call when possible to include visual connection
- Share meaningful content, not just memes
- Be vulnerable in appropriate ways online

## Building Your Connection Skills 🛠️

### Developing Mental Connection Abilities:

**Read Widely:** Expand your knowledge base to have more interesting conversations
**Practice Active Listening:** Focus completely on understanding others
**Ask Better Questions:** Move beyond ""How was your day?"" to ""What excited you most today?""
**Share Vulnerably:** Open up about your real thoughts and experiences

### Enhancing Physical Connection Abilities:

**Improve Your Presence:** Work on posture, energy, and confidence
**Practice Appropriate Touch:** Learn the art of meaningful, respectful physical connection
**Take Care of Yourself:** Maintain your health and appearance
**Be Genuinely Interested:** Show authentic appreciation for others

## The Patience Factor: Good Things Take Time ⏰

One crucial truth about deep connections: they can't be rushed. The person who connects with you completely might not appear immediately. They might develop these connections over time, or you might meet them when you're both ready.

**Daily Reminders:**
- Focus on becoming the type of person who can create these connections
- Don't settle for relationships that leave you feeling incomplete
- Appreciate the people currently in your life for what they do offer
- Stay open to new possibilities while nurturing existing relationships

## Red Flags to Avoid 🚩

Not everyone is capable of or interested in deep connection. Watch out for:
- People who only want one type of connection
- Those who seem uncomfortable with your complexity
- Individuals who don't invest equal effort in understanding you
- Anyone who tries to change your fundamental nature

## Creating a Connection-Rich Life 🌺

### Daily Habits for Better Relationships:

**Morning:** Start each day thinking about how you can be a better friend, partner, or colleague
**Throughout the Day:** Practice small acts of connection - genuine compliments, thoughtful questions, active listening
**Evening:** Reflect on your interactions and how you can improve tomorrow

### Weekly Practices:

**Deep Conversations:** Schedule time for meaningful discussions with important people
**Shared Experiences:** Create memories together through activities you both enjoy
**Personal Growth:** Work on becoming more interesting and emotionally available
**Gratitude:** Express appreciation for the connections you do have

### Monthly Reflections:

**Relationship Assessment:** Evaluate which relationships are thriving and which need attention
**Personal Development:** Identify areas where you can become a better connector
**New Opportunities:** Consider where you might meet like-minded people
**Goal Setting:** Establish intentions for improving your relationships

## The Universal Truth: We All Seek Complete Understanding 🌍

Whether you're religious or secular, young or old, introvert or extrovert, the human desire for complete understanding remains constant. We all want someone who appreciates our complexity, our contradictions, our full humanity.

This isn't about finding a perfect person - it's about finding someone who perfectly understands and appreciates your imperfections along with your strengths.

## Your Connection Legacy: What Will You Leave Behind? 🏛️

Four hundred years from now, the technologies will be different, the customs may have evolved, but the fundamental human need for deep connection will remain unchanged. The question is: what kind of connector will you be?

**Consider Your Impact:**
- How do people feel after spending time with you?
- Do you help others feel understood and appreciated?
- Are you someone who touches hearts and minds simultaneously?
- What would people say about the quality of connection you offer?

## Taking Action Today: Your Connection Challenge 🎯

This week, challenge yourself to:

1. **Have one conversation that goes deeper than usual** - Ask someone about their dreams, fears, or passions
2. **Show appreciation for someone's complete person** - Acknowledge both their intelligence and their character
3. **Practice being fully present** - Give someone your undivided attention for at least 30 minutes
4. **Reflect on your own complexity** - Consider what you want others to understand about you
5. **Reach out to someone special** - Let them know how they've impacted your life

## The Ripple Effect: Connection Spreads Connection 🌊

When you become someone who creates deep connections, you inspire others to do the same. You raise the standard for relationships in your circle. You become a catalyst for more meaningful human interactions.

Your friends watch how you treat others and learn from your example. Your family experiences deeper intimacy. Your colleagues enjoy more authentic workplace relationships. Your romantic partners feel more completely loved and understood.

## Embracing the Journey: Connection as a Lifelong Practice 🗺️

Remember, becoming a master of human connection is a lifelong journey. You won't perfect it overnight, and that's okay. Each interaction is an opportunity to practice, to learn, to grow.

Some days you'll connect beautifully with others. Other days you'll miss the mark. Both experiences teach you something valuable about yourself and about relationships.

## Final Thoughts: The Extraordinary in the Ordinary 🌟

The most extraordinary people aren't those who possess supernatural powers or achieve impossible feats. They're the ones who can see and touch the complete human being in front of them - mind, body, and everything in between.

They're the friends who remember your dreams and your favorite coffee order. They're the partners who appreciate both your intelligence and your quirks. They're the family members who love you for who you are and who you're becoming.

You have the power to be this type of extraordinary person for others. Start today. Start small. Start with one genuine conversation, one moment of complete presence, one act of seeing someone fully.

The world needs more people who can create complete connections. The question is: will you be one of them?

---

*Remember: Deep connections aren't just about finding the right people - they're about becoming the right person. Focus on developing your own capacity for understanding, appreciation, and authentic connection.*

At 26 weeks pregnant my HGB was 9.5. I was already taking iron supplement on alternating days at that point because I was having pica symptoms. I started taking it daily after I received those results.

Now I’m about 30 weeks. The iron supplements have made me the #1 most constipated woman on earth despite Miralax, prune juice, fiber, multiple walks daily, lots of fluids etc etc. And my symptoms are only worsening - fatigue is cray cray and pica is an obsession. What started as a craving has turned into an obsession like in the same way I *need* to drink water. My cravings are mostly cleaning supplies and industrial solvents that I’m using and smelling (not tasting, but close lol) multiple times a day. 

I’m also having heart palpitations and restless leg syndrome but not sure how much of that is normal pregnancy discomfort vs IDA.

I know my anemia isn’t severe but my symptoms are, and I’m not tolerating oral iron very well. Am I candidate for IV iron or is that generally reserved for very severe cases of anemia?

Also is it worth asking to have other vitamins checked ? Or an iron panel? I had severe HG from weeks 4-24, lost a lot of weight, never kept down a single prenatal. Wondering if something else could be causing the anemia and that’s why the iron isn’t helping. 

I’ve tried multiple formulations , take it w vitamin C rich foods, and I space it apart from coffee and dairy.

Let's be honest about something most of us experience but rarely discuss. We wake up, check our phones, rush through breakfast, commute to work, complete tasks, come home exhausted, watch some screens, and collapse into bed. Rinse and repeat.

Sound familiar? This isn't living - this is existing on autopilot.

The trap of automated living happens so gradually we don't notice it. One day we're curious kids full of wonder, and the next we're adults who've forgotten how to be amazed by a sunset or excited about learning something new.

**Here's what automated living looks like:**
→ Making decisions based on what others expect
→ Choosing safety over growth every single time  
→ Waiting for permission to pursue what makes you happy
→ Feeling guilty when you prioritize your own needs
→ Living for weekends and dreading Mondays

## The Physical Prison We Create 🏢

Our modern world has convinced us that success means staying busy, stressed, and constantly productive. We wear exhaustion like a badge of honor and treat our bodies like machines that should never need maintenance.

This physical-first mindset creates real problems:
- Chronic stress that manifests in headaches, muscle tension, and digestive issues
- Mental fog that makes simple decisions feel overwhelming  
- Emotional numbness where nothing feels particularly exciting anymore
- Social isolation despite being more ""connected"" than ever

When we're stuck in this mode, we become problem-seekers instead of solution-creators. Every challenge feels massive because we're already running on empty.

## Your Natural Connection to Everything Around You 🌍

Here's something fascinating: you're naturally designed to be in harmony with the world around you. Not in some mystical way, but in very practical, observable ways.

**Consider these everyday connections:**
- Your mood improves when you spend time in nature
- You feel energized around certain people and drained around others
- Certain environments make you more creative while others shut you down
- Your body has natural rhythms that align with daylight and seasons
- You instinctively know when something feels ""right"" or ""off""

These aren't coincidences. They're evidence of your natural ability to tune into the energy around you and respond accordingly.

## Shifting from Being to Frequency 📻

Think of yourself as a radio station. Right now, you might be broadcasting on a static-filled frequency that's hard to tune into. But with some adjustments, you can broadcast clearly on a frequency that attracts exactly what you want in life.

**Your frequency is determined by:**
- The thoughts you think most often
- How you treat yourself on a daily basis
- The standards you set for how others treat you
- What you believe you deserve to have and experience
- How much energy you invest in your own growth and happiness

When you operate from a higher frequency, everything changes. Opportunities appear. Relationships improve. Problems become solvable puzzles instead of overwhelming obstacles.

## The Art of Self-Investment Without Guilt 💎

One of the biggest frequency-killers is the guilt we feel about prioritizing ourselves. We've been conditioned to think that putting ourselves first is selfish, but this couldn't be further from the truth.

**Practical self-investment looks like:**
- Setting boundaries without over-explaining or apologizing
- Investing in experiences and tools that help you grow
- Saying no to commitments that drain your energy
- Spending time on activities that genuinely bring you joy
- Taking care of your physical health as a non-negotiable
- Learning new skills that excite and challenge you

This isn't about becoming self-centered or ignoring others' needs. It's about filling your own cup first so you have something valuable to offer the world.

## Attracting Your Frequency Match 🧲

Here's where things get interesting. When you consistently operate from a higher frequency, you naturally attract people, opportunities, and experiences that match that energy level.

**This happens because:**
- You project confidence that draws positive attention
- You make decisions from clarity instead of desperation
- You recognize quality opportunities because you feel worthy of them
- You attract people who appreciate and reciprocate your energy
- You repel energy drains because they no longer feel familiar

It's not magic - it's natural law. Energy seeks its own level.

## Practical Steps to Raise Your Daily Frequency 🚀

### Morning Frequency Boosters
Start your day by consciously choosing your energy rather than letting it be determined by whatever hits you first.

- Begin with 5 minutes of deep breathing before checking any devices
- Set one positive intention for the day
- Move your body in a way that feels good
- Consume something that nourishes you (food, music, reading)
- Remind yourself of one thing you're grateful for

### Throughout the Day
- Notice when your energy dips and ask what caused it
- Take micro-breaks to reset your frequency (even 30 seconds helps)
- Surround yourself with inputs that elevate you
- Practice saying what you mean without softening your truth
- Choose responses instead of reactions when challenges arise

### Evening Frequency Reset
- Reflect on moments when you felt most alive during the day
- Release any energy that doesn't belong to you
- Set your space up for restorative rest
- Engage in activities that genuinely bring you peace
- End the day acknowledging something you did well

## Creating Your Personal Frequency Revolution 🎯

The most powerful frequency shift happens when you stop asking ""What do others want from me?"" and start asking ""What do I want to create in my life?""

**This revolution involves:**
- Defining success on your own terms instead of society's
- Building relationships with people who celebrate your growth
- Creating work that feels meaningful to you
- Designing a lifestyle that supports your natural rhythms
- Developing skills and interests that genuinely fascinate you
- Making choices based on what feels expansive rather than contractive

## The Ripple Effect of Your Higher Frequency 🌊

When you operate from your authentic frequency, you give others permission to do the same. Your family notices. Your friends are inspired. Colleagues see a different way of being. Strangers pick up on your energy.

You become a living example that there's another way to exist in the world - one where you don't have to sacrifice your well-being for success, where you can be both kind and boundaried, where you can pursue your dreams without apology.

## Maintaining Your Frequency in a Chaotic World ⚖️

The world will always have chaos. There will always be people operating from lower frequencies who try to pull you down to their level. Economic uncertainty, political tension, social pressure - these are constants.

Your power lies not in controlling these external factors, but in maintaining your frequency regardless of what's happening around you.

**Frequency maintenance strategies:**
- Regular check-ins with yourself about how you're feeling
- Quick recalibration practices when you notice you're off-center
- Protective strategies for your energy (limiting exposure to negativity)
- Recovery practices for when life inevitably knocks you off balance
- A support system of people who understand and support your growth

## The Long-Term Vision: A Life Well-Lived 🔮

Imagine looking back on your life decades from now. What would you want to see? Probably not a list of tasks completed or approval earned from people whose opinions don't actually matter.

You'd want to see a life where you:
- Followed your curiosity and developed your unique gifts
- Treated yourself with the same kindness you showed others
- Made decisions based on what felt right for you
- Created meaningful connections with people who truly knew you
- Contributed something valuable to the world in your own way
- Experienced joy, growth, and adventure on your own terms

## Your Frequency is Your Legacy 🎨

Every interaction you have, every choice you make, every boundary you set or don't set - these all contribute to the frequency you leave behind in the world.

When you live authentically, you inspire others to question their own automated patterns. When you prioritize your well-being, you show others it's possible. When you pursue what truly matters to you, you give others courage to examine what truly matters to them.

## Starting Your Frequency Transformation Today 🌅

You don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. Frequency shifts happen through consistent small adjustments that compound over time.

**Begin with one simple question:** ""Does this choice raise or lower my frequency?""

Apply this to everything:
- The content you consume
- The conversations you engage in
- How you spend your free time
- The goals you pursue
- The relationships you maintain
- The thoughts you entertain

Trust your inner knowing. You already have everything you need to live from a higher frequency - you just need to remember how to access it.

## The Time is Now ⏰

There's never been a more important time to step into your authentic frequency. The world needs people who are willing to live consciously, make thoughtful choices, and prioritize their own growth not as an act of selfishness, but as a gift to everyone around them.

Your unique frequency is needed. Your authentic way of being in the world matters. The person you become when you stop apologizing for taking up space and start celebrating the energy you bring - that person has something valuable to offer.

Stop existing on autopilot. Start broadcasting your true frequency. The world is waiting to tune in.

---

*Remember: You are not here to shrink yourself to make others comfortable. You are here to shine at your natural frequency and attract everything that matches your authentic energy. The brighter you shine, the more permission you give others to do the same.*

## Ready to Elevate Your Frequency? 🎵

The journey from mere existence to authentic living starts with a single conscious choice. Make that choice today. Your future self is counting on it.

1n31mrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AkoBaYungGago/comments/1n31mrw/abyg_for_breaking_up_with_my_bf_after_he_made/,ABYG for breaking up with my bf after he made zero effort on my birthday?,"[please dont repost this anywhere. thanks!]

As the title says, I (F26) and my boyfriend (M28) just broke up recently.

Weeks prior, hindi na rin talaga kami okay kasi nagsinungaling siya sakin (*old issue na to*) and we went no contact for a week. I told him na I needed time to process things kasi paulit-ulit na lang yung problema namin. He agreed, pero tuloy-tuloy pa rin siya sa pag-update kahit hindi ako nagrereply.

Come my birthday, he greeted me at 12am. Natuwa naman ako kasi sakto talaga (*lol bare minimum*) I responded kasi aside from it being my birthday, ayoko na rin patagalin yung no contact namin. Though hindi pa rin namin napag-usapan yung issue, which I understood kasi wrong timing nga naman on my special day.

Morning pa lang hanggang afternoon, I was waiting and hoping he’d drop by or at least do something simple, pero buong araw busy siya sa paglalaro ng computer games. To think na kakagaling lang namin sa no contact pero hindi ko siya makausap ng maayos kasi delayed lagi replies niya dahil in game nga, and he didn’t even bother asking if I had plans for the day na para bang nakalimutan niya kung anong meron. Sobrang sumama loob ko.

That night, I decided to ask: *“Wala kang something for me today, baby? Haha.”* I admit nakakahiya na nagtanong pa talaga ako, pero I wanted him to realize na I was hurt. Tumawa lang siya and said nabili ko na raw kasi yung dapat niyang bibilhin. I said, *“Kaya wala na lang? Haha okay.”*, puro reasons na lang sinagot niya.

Flashback: a month ago pa may plano siya to book us an Airbnb for my birthday daw kasi gusto niya mag-relax lang kami. Pero never na niya yun binanggit ulit nung nagka-problem kami so I let it go. Still, I was lowkey expecting kahit simple gesture lang especially since may pinagdadaanan din kami. Gusto ko lang makita na may effort siya. Pero sobrang nalungkot ako na wala talaga. Never naman ako nag-ask or nagpabili ng kahit ano all throughout our relationship, so he knows na maaappreciate ko kahit small effort lang. Ni hindi niya man lang ako naisip puntahan or say sorry kung bakit wala siyang nabigay kasi maiintindihan ko naman. What hurt the most, kahit time niya lang sana ibigay niya sakin, pero nilaan pa rin niya sa ibang bagay.

Same thing last year, rough patch din kami nun and hindi niya ako binati. Kinabukasan lang siya naggreet ng belated happy birthday and that’s it pero hindi ko na ginawang issue.

Ayoko na sana i-big deal kasi sa iba maliit lang na bagay to. Pero for me, showing no effort at all on your partner’s supposed-special day speaks volumes. I talked to him about it that night and ended things with him. The next day, nagyaya pa siya na mag-coffee kami sa Tagaytay pero hindi na ako pumayag kasi halatang last-minute plan lang.

So, ABYG for leaving my bf kasi wala siyang pinrepare for my birthday?",13,1756455393.0,AkoBaYungGago,8,0.89,False
1n31mok,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n31mok/the_journey_from_doubt_to_genuine_trust_a/,The Journey from Doubt to Genuine Trust: A Practical Guide to Authentic Belief 🌱,"

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to have unshakeable confidence in their beliefs while others question everything? The difference often lies not in what they believe, but in how they arrived at those beliefs. Today, let's explore a revolutionary approach to developing authentic trust and conviction in life - one that doesn't require you to abandon your critical thinking or accept things blindly.

## The Problem with Forced Belief 🚫

Most of us have encountered people who insist we should ""just have faith"" without questioning. They present two stark options: believe or face consequences. This approach creates what we might call ""fear-based acceptance"" - agreeing to something not because it makes sense, but because we're afraid of what might happen if we don't.

Think about it in everyday terms. When someone at work tells you to follow a procedure ""because that's how we've always done it,"" without explaining the reasoning, how do you feel? Probably frustrated and unconvinced. The same principle applies to life's bigger questions.

## Fear vs. Understanding: Two Different Paths 🛤️

There's a fundamental difference between being pushed toward something and being guided toward it. When we're pushed, we resist. When we're guided with patience and explanation, we move willingly.

Consider how you teach a child to look both ways before crossing the street. You could simply say ""Do it or you'll get in trouble,"" or you could explain why it keeps them safe. The second approach creates genuine understanding, not just compliance.

This same principle applies to developing trust and conviction in any area of life. Real confidence comes from understanding, not from threats or promises of rewards.

## The Power of Questioning Everything 🤔

Here's where things get interesting. The most reliable path to genuine conviction often starts with healthy skepticism. When we examine our beliefs, question our assumptions, and test our ideas against reality, something remarkable happens - we either discover flaws that need fixing or we develop unshakeable confidence in what we've verified.

Practical steps for daily life:
- **Question your assumptions**: When you find yourself saying ""I believe this because..."", examine that ""because""
- **Seek evidence**: Look for real-world examples that support or challenge your views
- **Stay open to change**: Be willing to adjust your position when you encounter new information
- **Test through experience**: Don't just think about ideas - try them out when possible

## Beyond the Fear of the Unknown 💪

Many belief systems operate on fear - fear of punishment, fear of missing out, fear of being wrong. But think about the most fulfilling relationships in your life. Are they based on fear? Of course not. They're built on understanding, respect, and genuine care.

The same applies to our relationship with truth and certainty. When we approach life's big questions from a place of curiosity rather than fear, we create space for authentic discovery.

## The Three Stages of Authentic Belief Development 🎯

### Stage 1: Before Investigation
At this stage, we might hold opinions we've inherited from others - family, friends, society, media. These beliefs often feel shaky because we haven't personally examined them. They're vulnerable to challenge because they lack personal foundation.

### Stage 2: During Investigation  
This is where many people get stuck. They start questioning and analyzing but never complete the journey. They become professional skeptics, doubting everything but never moving toward resolution. While questioning is essential, getting trapped in endless analysis leads nowhere productive.

### Stage 3: Beyond Investigation
Here's the breakthrough moment. After thorough examination, we eventually reach the limits of analysis. We've gathered information, tested ideas, and explored possibilities. At this point, something beautiful happens - we transcend the need for constant questioning because we've built genuine understanding.

## Practical Daily Applications 🏃‍♂️

**In Decision Making:**
- Research your options thoroughly
- Consider multiple perspectives  
- Test small before committing big
- Trust your informed intuition

**In Relationships:**
- Don't accept promises blindly - look for consistent actions
- Ask questions when things don't make sense
- Build trust gradually through shared experiences
- Value understanding over agreement

**In Career Choices:**
- Investigate industries and roles thoroughly
- Talk to people actually doing the work
- Try projects or internships when possible
- Make informed leaps, not blind jumps

**In Learning:**
- Don't memorize - understand the why behind information
- Question sources and seek multiple viewpoints
- Apply knowledge practically to test its value
- Remain curious and open to new insights

## Why This Approach Works Long-Term ⏳

Beliefs developed through personal investigation and experience have several advantages:

1. **Stability**: They're harder to shake because they're based on your own discovery
2. **Authenticity**: They genuinely reflect your understanding, not someone else's agenda  
3. **Adaptability**: Since they're based on reasoning, they can evolve with new information
4. **Confidence**: You can explain and defend them because you understand them

## The Balance Between Doubt and Trust ⚖️

The goal isn't to become a permanent skeptic or a gullible believer. It's to develop the skill of appropriate trust - knowing when to question and when to move forward with confidence.

In practical terms:
- **Question new claims** until you understand them
- **Trust verified patterns** in your experience
- **Remain open** to updating your views
- **Act decisively** once you have sufficient understanding

## Moving Forward: Your Next Steps 🚀

Starting today, you can begin developing more authentic conviction in your life:

1. **Identify one belief you hold** that you've never really examined
2. **Spend time researching** different perspectives on this topic
3. **Look for real-world evidence** that supports or challenges your view
4. **Discuss with people** who hold different opinions respectfully
5. **Make a conscious decision** to either maintain, modify, or change your position
6. **Live according to your informed conclusion** with confidence

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

When you develop authentic conviction through understanding rather than fear or blind acceptance, it impacts every area of your life. Your decisions become more aligned with your actual values. Your relationships become more genuine. Your career choices reflect your real interests and strengths.

Perhaps most importantly, you become someone others can trust and respect - not because you never change your mind, but because when you do hold a position, it's based on genuine understanding rather than wishful thinking or social pressure.

## Final Thoughts 💭

The journey from doubt to authentic trust isn't always comfortable, but it's always worthwhile. It requires patience with yourself and others, courage to question popular opinions, and wisdom to know when you've investigated enough to move forward.

Remember, the goal isn't to have all the answers immediately. It's to develop a reliable process for finding answers that truly serve your life and the lives of those around you.

Whether you're making small daily decisions or grappling with life's biggest questions, the principle remains the same: genuine understanding creates lasting confidence, while forced belief creates hidden doubt.

Take your time. Ask good questions. Test your ideas against reality. And trust that this process, while sometimes challenging, leads to a more authentic and fulfilling way of living.

The path forward is clear - not because someone told you so, but because you can see it for yourself. And that makes all the difference.
