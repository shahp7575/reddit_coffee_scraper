I have a college degree and I have a job. I didn‚Äôt need the job to get the degree, and I didn‚Äôt need the degree to get the job, because they‚Äôre totally unrelated. But I‚Äôm not bitter. Both of them have been good to me.

I‚Äôd be particularly interested in finding a penpal or two from overseas. English is obviously my first language, but I can communicate in Spanish, Finnish, and German as well, and I‚Äôm open to stumbling through other languages as we go if you‚Äôre really up for an adventure. 

At any rate, I‚Äôm interested in hearing your perspective on everything. What makes life good? How do our circumstances affect our outlook on life, our free will? Are you just wasting good coffee by putting flavored creamer in it? You know‚Ä¶ whatever. I can‚Äôt promise that I‚Äôll respond quickly, but I can promise that my responses will be thoughtful, well-meant, and maybe even funny if you like that sort of thing.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I like running (as much as one can ‚Äúlike‚Äù running), writing, singing, classical music, linguistics, and ruining my perfectly good mental health by overthinking things.

I‚Äôd be happy to start with e-mail and eventually move to snail mail if we actually manage to log a few message exchanges and get along haha. Gender doesn‚Äôt matter. I only ask that you be at least 25 years old and keep things platonic.

Thanks!

- Database management (Airtable, Firebase, etc.)

today my neighbour of 4 years is moving. she didnt even talk to me, i found out when she started the packing up her belongings and putting them into her car. i tried to strike up a conversation but she just gave me a tight smile.

‚Äúcan i help with anything?‚Äù i offered

‚Äúno, its fine thanks‚Äù she replied, bluntly.

later that day her and her husband drove off for good.

it was sudden, but we were never very close and i assume theyve been planning this for a while. good for them.

i sit in my lounge wondering what to do for the rest of the evening. maybe i‚Äôll just order chinese and watch some tv. shit. right. i misplaced the remote. ah well i‚Äôll just watch netflix i guess.

01.02.25
a few weeks later another neighbour put their house up for sale. it was a flat shared by four professional 20-something-year olds. i guess its good weather and stuff so it kind of makes sense that people are selling right now.

weirdly enough last night i got this weird smell, something metallic, as i lay in bed. not sure what that was.

the next morning i came downstairs and one of the chairs was pulled out from the table, even though i couldve sworn i tucked it in. maybe im just being silly, i mean i probably just was tired and forgot to put it back before going to bed.

but i couldnt help but feel a little uncomfortable that day. as much as i want to, i really dont think i left that chair there.

03.02.25
today i caught up with my friend natalie for a coffee. her boyfriend proposed and theyre planning the wedding. they want to go to bali for a honeymoon, which sounds nice. she said i seemed a little off, and i admitted ive been feeling a but nervous recently. i told nat ive been thinking of investing in a security camera, and she said if it makes me feel better, but shes a little concerned it will just feed into my anxiety.

i guess shes right, plus being realistic it would be a waste of money anyway, and moneys already a little tight right now.

11.03.25
its been getting worse, ive started to hear footsteps some nights, but i never see anyone. small things seem to be out of place but nothings missing and all my doors are locked. i think i should talk to someone about this, im concerned about this.

18.03.25
its been a week and ive scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist. i mean i know i have anxiety, thats nothing new, but this paranoia isnt normal and i need to get to the bottom of it. my third close neighbour miguel is apparently talking about wanting to move, but he hasnt said anything to me about it. apparently his kids are having trouble sleeping because of noise or something. i dont exactly know what he means, but its understandable.

19.03.25
today when i came downstairs in the morning, the light in the kitchen was on. i know i didnt leave it on, i even switch it on last night, i didnt even cook. a chill ran down my spine but i can just wait for my appointment, its only a few days away now.

21.03.25
today i walked out to miguel, as he hauled boxes into the moving van. hes a friendly man, but he seemed a little awkward now.

‚Äúhey so, how comes everyones moving right now? is there something up with this area or what?‚Äù i ask

he shoots me a sideways glance as he begins, before closing his mouth again and frowning. ‚Äúwell you know, its been waking us up a lot, its just been so noisy. ever since, well‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äúever since what?‚Äù

‚Äúwell i dont mean to judge, but ever since‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off uncomfortably.

‚Äúwhat are you talking about? ever since what?‚Äù

his wife and son approached with armloads more stuff and he stopped talking, shaking his head. ‚Äúlook im sorry its probably personal, i‚Äôll just text you to explain later‚Äù

‚Äúokay‚Ä¶‚Äù i felt uneasy for the rest of the day. what was so personal he couldnt tell me then?

later that night, as i sit in bed watching netflix (not the tv, since i still havent found the remote), my phone pings. its miguel. im not even sure why hes up its past midnight, its 1:42am to be exact. but i open it anyway.

‚Äúhey its miguel :) sorry i couldnt say earlier, but the kids have been having trouble sleeping since that noise started at night‚Äù

‚Äúwhat noise?‚Äù

‚Äúi mean its not my business why he‚Äôs there, im not judging, but its ever since you started letting that man in through your balcony door in the early hours.‚Äù i stopped reading, fingers shaking. this has to be a joke. please be a fucking unfunny joke.

i took a deep, ragged breath, and i noticed that awful metallic smell again.

1jgyj9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jgyj9m/this_doesnt_make_sense/,This doesn‚Äôt make sense,"Hi, So before a month I started a new job and there is a girl that seemed is interested and has a crush on me, like she randomly speak to me about things that seems strange to talk with a coworker like her hobbies or her weekly schedule or asking me what did I do in the weekend and one day she made me ""special coffee"", even my boss noticed that and one time he said to us that ""if you want to talk you too just go to a coffee shop"".

So I decided to make a move and sent her an Instagram request in the weekend but I waited 2 days and I was disappointed that she didn't accept it, which seemed strange since she in the previous day asked me how many Instagram followers I have and showed a picture from her prom, so I took this as a hint, so I cancelled it and when I went on to the workplace she didn't mention this and spoke to me normally.

So we went to work normally for a week and continued to speak to each other and everyone noticed in the workplace that there something between us, but still I didn't understand why she didn't accept my follow request on instagram, so in her birthday she made a TikTok(she gave me her TikTok long ago) celebrating so I commented ""happy birthday, boss (her name)"", but for some reason she neither put a like or replied to my comment, which I failed to understand so as respond to this I stopped talking to her completely in the workplace and started to just act like she doesn't exist and have been like this for 2 days, she also stopped talking to me but for some reason I noticed that she is trying to get my attention, like standing in front of me or her coming in the morning to clean the machine I work on.

What do you think about this? Can someone   help on what to do? 
1) Do I continue to ignore her.
2) Talk to her directly about this.
3) Or just ignore all of this and talk to her normally ",1,1742611156.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Hey Reddit, I ‚Äò21/F‚Äô have been living with three other girls for the past year (all ‚Äò22/F‚Äô), so I‚Äôve only known them for a couple of months. But lately I feel so uncomfortable in my own home that I‚Äôve been avoiding the shared spaces as much as possible. To give you some context, I‚Äôm not from the same country as them, so there are some cultural differences and language barriers. I‚Äôve made an effort to communicate, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my directness comes across as rude or if I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

One major issue I‚Äôve been having is the cleanliness of our shared spaces. We each have a cleaning duty each week, but I feel like I‚Äôm constantly cleaning up after two of my housemates. For example, the bathroom was a mess‚Äîalmost clogged drain, sand in the shower, and a red/orange stain on the floor. I asked them to clean it, but now I‚Äôm questioning whether I overreacted. I know I‚Äôm not perfect, and I‚Äôve been working on the complaints I received about being too loud when coming home drunk on weekends. I‚Äôve made a conscious effort to reduce the noise and go out less, and since then, I haven‚Äôt heard any complaints from them.

But here‚Äôs where things really get uncomfortable: One of my housemates has been letting her friends into the house without warning by giving them keys. They‚Äôve just appeared in our home out of nowhere, which is super unsettling. I was told off for having my then-boyfriend over without telling them, so I started telling them every time he was over just to make them feel more comfortable. But my other housemate has her boyfriend over all the time, and there‚Äôs never been an issue with him having a key and just showing up without informing anyone‚Äîespecially not me.

That‚Äôs not the only thing that‚Äôs been bothering me. They‚Äôve made me upset multiple times. For instance, I was crying in the kitchen once, and no one acknowledged it, even though I overheard them talking badly about me just outside the kitchen. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind trying to figure out what I‚Äôm doing wrong. It‚Äôs hard when they don‚Äôt communicate with me unless it‚Äôs to ask me to do their chores or help with something.

There‚Äôs also the fact that half the time, I‚Äôm sleeping at my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs place with his roommates, and there never seem to be any issues there. They‚Äôre always friendly, and I feel comfortable. Meanwhile, my roommates have barely checked in on me, even after I ended up in the hospital a couple of weeks ago. Not a single one of them asked me if I was okay afterward, which hurt more than I expected.

On top of all of this, I‚Äôve started hearing rumors about my housemates from other people. At first, I didn‚Äôt want to believe them because I wanted to think the best of them, but now, after everything that‚Äôs happened, I‚Äôm starting to feel like those rumors weren‚Äôt just gossip. I even reached out to one of their old roommates, and I‚Äôm meeting her for coffee soon to talk about my current roommates.

I just feel so uncomfortable in my own home. I avoid the shared spaces, and sometimes I sleep at my ex‚Äôs place just to escape the tension.

My ice blended frappes are so frothy that I hate them. I've tried the 48oz and the 64oz tall container. I've adjusted the ice ratio, I've adjusted the liquid ratio, I've pre-blended the ice, I've run the blender after blending to get rid of the air bubbles, I've tried everything I could think of and everything that was suggested to me but I'm just not getting them the way I like them. Maybe I'm picky, but why should I suffer when life is so short, right?

So I go to the local coffee shop that has perfect frappe's and I see that they use ""The Quiet One"" with the advance container. They, like a lot of places, use ice, milk, and a dry frappe powder/mix. I also have a frappe powder mix that tastes great. The container has a different shape and a different blade than the ones that come with the non-commercial Vitamix's. It looks like the container has the same drive socket size as the 5200. The motor for the commercial blenders is supposed to be 2.2-2.3hp and the non-commercial one is 2.0hp. Since I'm not running it for very long, I'm sure that part will be okay. The centering base is definitely different, but I think I can pull mine off and slot in the one for the Advance container if I buy one of those.

Vijay Prashad17 Mar, 2025

It seems like a century ago I stood in the graveyard in Beirut's Al-Basta neighbourhood. There was magic in the graveyard, which is in an area of shops ‚Äî bassata, from which the quarter gets its name, means to ""spread your merchandise on the ground"".

I had come on the advice of the Irish journalist Robert Fisk (1946-2020) to see where St. John Philby (1885-1960) had been buried.

During one of our coffees at Caf√© Younes at the upper end of Hamra, I had brought along a copy of Elizabeth Monroe‚Äôs Philby of Arabia (1973) an old-fashioned biography riddled with errors but filled with charm ‚Äî a book written based on Monroe‚Äôs conversations with Philby, who had gone from socialism to the British Foreign Office to Islam and then to being the principal advisor of King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia.

""You better go have a look at where Philby was buried,"" Fisk said. And what Fisk said, I did.

The jaunt, however, was a bit disappointing. I could not find his grave. It was said that Philby‚Äôs son, the famous British intelligence agent who had all along been spying for the Soviets, had scrawled on his father‚Äôs gravestone something about him being a great explorer. An ancient man at the cemetery told me that a lot of old graves had been covered over by the dead of the civil war.

I got lost on my walk back and found myself in front of the Maghen Abraham synagogue.

The building stopped me because it has an exterior that resembles a Venetian palazzo, the white and yellow ochre walls and embellishments a little out of place in what had been Beirut‚Äôs Wadi Abu Jamil, the Jewish Quarter. 

I understand why the synagogue had been built in this fashion. Beirut is a city of trade and merchants, and it made sense for the Jewish community to erect a grand building to rival other grand buildings (banks and markets). The neighbourhood had other synagogues, mostly in apartments, so this was a statement of the community‚Äôs establishment rather than of architectural fidelity to an ancient synagogue.

The synagogue was in mid-restoration. A caf√© nearby was a good place to seek some answers. The man who ran it told me that yes, it is a Jewish place of worship, and yes, it is being resorted.

But, apart from making me a strong coffee, he did not have anything else to tell me. Later, the internet provided some answers, but it was also not sufficient. I went in search of someone who could fill the gaps of my curiosity and turned to one of the people I often sought out to explain the mysteries of Beirut.

Elias Khoury (1948-2024) was sitting at his desk in the Institute for Palestine Studies, chain-smoking and drinking little cups of strong coffee.

Born in Beirut during the Nakba that befell Palestine, Elias spent his life defending the Palestinian fight for emancipation. From his hospital bed, he posted on Facebook about his 'year of pain': ""Gaza and Palestine have been brutally beaten for nearly a year too, and they are resilient. They are the model from which I learn each day to love life.""

Elias knew the outlines of the story, but he did not know it all. He knew that the synagogue had been built in the 1920s, that it had been damaged during the civil war, and that it was only during the civil war that Beirut‚Äôs Jews began to flee the city ‚Äì not because of anti-Semitism, but because their neighbourhood fell squarely on the frontline between the two major factions in East and West Beirut. ""The civil war drove the Jewish community out,"" I wrote in my notebook, probably quoting him. ""No one drove them out.""

Beirut's synagogue is also Calcutta's synagogue

Calcutta (India), where I was born, is not an ancient city. It was created by trade and resembles Beirut in more ways than I can tell you ‚Äî there is something about our old cities that makes my blood flow faster.

When I was a little boy, my brother had a friend ‚Äî Mordy Cohen ‚Äî who lived in Calcutta's old Jewish quarter in Bowbazar. Mordy was a bit of a charlatan, who used to hustle the Rabbi to pay him some money so that he could help make a quorum on the days of low attendance in the synagogue.

It was in his home that I first got a taste of the spectacular Baghdadi Jewish Indian food, including the alu makalla that I make and enjoy to this day.

The historians of the Jewish community (Flower Elias and Judith Cooper Elias) say that the first recorded Jewish migrant to Calcutta was Shalom Obadiah Cohen, who came in 1798 from Aleppo, and then a wave of Baghdadi Jews came to trade in this British colonial city from the early 19th century.

Three families, at least, became fabulously wealthy: the Judahs, the Ezras, and the Sassoons ‚Äì all traders in indigo, silk, and mostly opium. The Sassoon family cornered seventy percent of the opium trade that left Bengal‚Äôs shores for China during the 19th century ‚Äî the details are in Phillip Stansky‚Äôs Sassoon: The Worlds of Philip and Sybil, 2003.

As if in a mirror, around the same time as the Baghdadi Jews came to Calcutta, they began to settle in Beirut and gave the city its first chief Rabbi ‚Äî Moise Yedid-Levy from 1779 to 1829.

Nagi Gergi Zeidan, the author of Juifs du Liban (2020), spent almost thirty years fixated on reconstructing the history of the Jewish community of his country.

Zeidan‚Äôs own story is interesting: born into a family rooted in the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party of Antoun Saadeh, Zeidan developed an interest in the lost story of the Jews of Lebanon and then became the chronicler of that story just as Lebanese Jews left the country for the West and for Israel ‚Äî although the more accurate book is Tomer Levi‚Äôs The Jews of Beirut: The Rise of a Levantine Community, 2012.

In his book, Zeidan has a portrait of the Maghen Abraham synagogue. Mo√Øse Sassoon, who was born in Alexandria (Egypt) in 1867, moved to Calcutta, joined his family members in their thriving business and made his own money as a trader ‚Äî his mansion on 8, Middleton Street is now an ugly building that houses several offices and apartments. 

Mo√Øse‚Äôs parents Abraham and Ramah Meyer moved to Beirut in 1890, and his father died there seven years later. In 1926, in honour of his father, Mo√Øse funded the construction of the Maghen Abraham synagogue.

Beirut‚Äôs hopes

Maghen Abraham was not just a place of prayer. It was a major community institution that included a sports club and a soup kitchen (La Gout du Lait or the Taste of Milk).

It supported the 14,000 Jews who lived in the neighbourhood just next to the French colonial headquarters (the Grand Serail), now the office of Lebanon‚Äôs prime minister.

What put this neighbourhood at risk was not anti-Jewish sentiment in Lebanon but its location. As the Lebanese Civil War broke out in 1975, the frontline within Beirut ran right through the Wadi Abu Jamil.

At one point, in fact, fighters from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation guarded the synagogue. But there was no way to protect the Green Line, the divide between West and East Beirut.

In 1976, Joseph Farhi took the Maghen Abraham‚Äôs Torah to the safety of the Safra Bank (Geneva, Switzerland) and two years later, chief Rabbi Yacoub Chreim left Lebanon. That was when the synagogue closed. In 1982, when the Israelis invaded Lebanon, they bombed the synagogue from the air and from sea, and in fact, accelerated the departure of the Lebanese Jewish community from their homeland.

PLO fighters stationed outside the synagogue during the Lebanese Civil War.
PLO fighters stationed outside the synagogue during the Lebanese Civil War.
Eighteen years later, after an insurgency led by Hezbollah, Israel‚Äôs occupation of Lebanon finally ended. It was in this new period that the reconstruction of central Beirut began under a government-back consortium called Solidere.

In 2009, Rabbi Isaac Arazi, one of the leaders of Beirut‚Äôs Jewish community, expressed his joy when the renovation of the synagogue was included in the project.

Every single political group embraced the renovation. Hezbollah‚Äôs Hassan Nasrallah said of the renovation, ""This is a religious place of worship, and its restoration is welcome."" In fact, Hezbollah contributed financially to the rebuilding of the synagogue, which was completed just after 2014.

Around that time, I went to see Mohammed Afif, who was Hezbollah‚Äôs spokesperson, in a very modest office in Beirut‚Äôs Da‚Äôaheh neighbourhood. Afif told me that Hezbollah‚Äôs views on the synagogue and Lebanon‚Äôs Jewish population are always distorted: Hezbollah, he said, is not against Jews, only against Israel‚Äôs occupation of the Palestinians and its attacks on Lebanon.

When I told him I was from Calcutta, where the money came from for the original synagogue, he said to me with a smile, ""Maybe get some money from there again to rebuild it."" Afif was assassinated in November 2024 by an Israeli bomb in Beirut‚Äôs Ras al-Nabaa area, not five minutes drive from the synagogue.

Mental stressors: I have always wondered if the women in my family and extended family fall severely ill because we are required to be independent, head-strong and always capable.

1jgy8i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jgy8i8/i_just_bought_a_new_house_my_kid_is_obsessed_with/,I just bought a new house. My kid is obsessed with the crawlspace.,"Buying a new house is never easy, especially in the modern market. Regardless, I had to move due to my job transferring me to their offices in another city, and so I had to sell my old home and move myself and my son, Ryan, a few states over.

We took a weekend to visit the city so I could tour a few homes that looked promising, and that's when I first visited our current house. It was a nice little two story with a big yard, perfect for a ten year old kid who loved to run around and play. It was during the house tour that we first found out about the crawlspace.

The real estate agent was letting me know some key details about the house, and Ryan was clearly not happy about being dragged along for something like this. As we finished talking the real estate agent seemed to notice this and leaned down to address Ryan directly.

""Hey kiddo, this must be pretty boring for you, huh?""

Ryan nodded.

""I was gonna save this for last, but...do you want to see something cool?""

Ryan nodded again. I gave the realtor a worried look, but he just smiled and gestured for us to follow.

We followed him upstairs to the guest bedroom, which I was planning on converting into Ryan's if we went ahead with the purchase. It also gave me piece of mind since the guest bedroom and the master were right next to each other.

The realtor went to the closet and opened the double doors for us to see inside. Nothing seemed weird until he reached down and pressed hard against a section of the wall. The panel sunk into the wall and rolled aside, revealing a small hollow space built between the two bedrooms.

""No way!"" Ryan said. He bent down and stuck his head inside the hollow space.

""What is this?"" I asked the realtor.

""Well, this home was custom built, see,"" he said, ""and the guy had this kid who wanted a fort or something, you know how kids are. Well, a treehouse was out of the option since nothing good for that grows around here, so the guy had this idea to build a little hidey-hole for his kid. I call it the crawlspace.""

""Well, isn't this a bit of a safety hazard?"" I said. ""What if Ryan got stuck in there?""

""Not to worry, ma'am."" the realtor said. He knelt down to talk to Ryan. ""Hey buddy, can you get in there and try to shut the door for me?""

Ryan obliged. He crawled into the hollow and tried to push the panel, but couldn't get it to budge.

""The panel can only be opened or closed from the outside."" the realtor said. He gestured for Ryan to come out, and once he was out of the crawlspace, the realtor pushed a different section of wall and the panel slid back into place. ""See?"" he said. ""Plus, the crawlspace is right up against the master bedroom, so if this guy gets up to any mischief in there you'll be able to hear him clear as day.""

""Mom, can we get this house, pleeeeeeaaaaaaasssssse?"" Ryan begged, tugging on my arm.

""I'm gonna have to think about it, Ryan."" I said. ""This is a big decision for Mommy.""

We finished up the house tour and left to visit a few others before heading back to our hometown. For the next few days Ryan went on and on about how cool the crawlspace was and all the ideas he had for what he could do with it. I had my concerns about it and decided to check a few other listings before making a decision. However, as time went on, the crawlspace house was looking like a better and better option. It was pretty cheap for its size, was by a lot of great schools, and it would mean I only had a twenty minute commute. When I told Ryan I'd decided to buy the house he practically jumped for joy.

Moving in took a while, but once we were settled we took a weekend to decorate the crawlspace for Ryan's enjoyment. I put up some fairy lights inside and he moved in a bunch of his books for him to read, along with setting down an old blanket to make things comfortable. Once we were done it was honestly pretty charming; I could see why Ryan had wanted it so bad. But then again, what kind of kid doesn't want a secret space all to themselves?

Things were pretty great for the first week. Ryan was adjusting well to his new school, and even told me he made a friend by the name of Evan. I was excited to see him take to his new surroundings, it'd been my main concern about moving. Things were going well at my new job too; it was the same company so all the systems and stuff were the same, and my coworkers were all really nice. The second week was the same as the first, but things began to be strange the second weekend we spent in the house.

It was a late Saturday afternoon. I was laying in bed, watching something on Netflix. Ryan was playing in his room. I just got done with an episode of my show and paused it so I could go downstairs and grab a snack. That's when I heard something.

""Yeah,"" Ryan's quiet voice said, ""school's been going alright.""

I paused. It seemed as if Ryan was inside the crawlspace, but who was he talking to? He didn't have a phone and mine was sitting on my nightstand.

""I made a friend, his name is Evan."" he said. ""I think you'd like him.""

I stood by the wall, not saying anything.

Ryan hadn't always been as active as he is now. When he was little he spent a lot of time inside and came up with an imaginary friend. It'd been a bit hard to watch as a parent. Sure, lots of kids come up with imaginary friends, but you can't help but feel like it's a failure on your part that your kid has no 'real' friends. I figured that maybe Ryan had brought this friend back to help with the move.

I walked over to his bedroom and saw him reading a comic book inside the crawlspace.

""Hey kiddo,"" I said, ""I'm about to go make dinner. After that do you want to do a movie night?""

Ryan perked up and smiled. ""Do I get to pick?"" He said.

I nodded.

Things were fine for the rest of the weekend, and I didn't notice anything weird with Ryan. He was struggling a bit in math class, but that was about it. Then Ryan asked him if he could invite his friend Evan over to play. I gave the go ahead, hoping it'd make him feel less lonely.

Evan came over the next Saturday, and his mom decided to tag along so that we could get the chance to talk. We sat in the kitchen and drank some coffee while the boys played upstairs. Evan's mom was named Samantha, and we were getting along just fine.

""So, what happened to the man of the house?"" She asked.

""Oh, we split up when Ryan was about 4."" I said. ""He didn't really want custody and I was more than happy to keep Ryan away from him, so it's just been us for a while.""

""Anyone else come along?""

""A few guys, but...I dunno. It's not that Ryan didn't like them or anything, it's just that none of them really clicked, you know?""

Samantha nodded. ""I feel ya. I thought that I wouldn't get with anybody before I met my wife. I did think about dating the guy who owned this house though.""

""Oh, you knew him?""

""You don't?""

""Well, I never got the chance to meet him. Everything was done through the agent. I think he already moved to a second property or something.""

""I wouldn't blame him after what happened.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well--""

That's when we both heard Ryan yelling upstairs.

""Hey, let me out!""

We both got up and went upstairs to see what the commotion was about. We both went into Ryan's room and found Evan with his hand on the button for the panel, and Ryan crawling out of the crawlspace.

""What are you two doing?"" Samantha said, hands on her hips.

""We were playing hide and seek,"" Evan explained, ""and Ryan went into his little hideout, and I closed the door just to mess with him a little bit.""

Samantha turned to me, as if expecting an explanation. I told her about the crawlspace and how the panel worked, and she then turned to Evan and told him off for doing something like locking Ryan in there.

""If you get up to something like that again,"" she said, ""We'll leave and you'll be grounded for two weeks, understand?""

""Yes, Mom."" Evan said.

""Good, now apologize to Ryan.""

""Sorry for locking you in there."" Evan said.

""It's OK."" Ryan said. ""It's not that scary, I just didn't want to be stuck in there.""

With that settled, me and Samantha headed back downstairs to continue our coffee and conversation.

""Sorry about that."" Samantha said. ""Evan's harmless, I promise, it's just that sometimes he doesn't get when something is a bit dangerous.""

""It's OK."" I said. ""i honestly should have told them to stay away from that thing.""

""Why's it there, anyway?"" Samantha asked.

'Oh, yeah, funny story. The last owner had this place custom made, and he had it built in for his kid so they'd have a little secret lair. You know how kids are.""

""Huh."" Samantha said. She took a long sip from her coffee. ""I wonder if that has anything to do with what happened.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well,"" she said, ""I knew the guy who lived here had a kid. You'd see him at school events, things like that. He had a daughter, about Ryan and Evan's age, but then one day she went missing.""

""Missing?""

""Yeah, apparently it was on a camping trip too."" She said. ""He went to go get something from a cooler and when he turned around she was just gone. They combed through that whole forest trying to find her, but nothing every turned up. Eventually the police investigated him for foul play, but there was no evidence that he did anything to her.""

""When did all this happen?""

""Oh, about a year ago, I think."" She said. ""The police got done investigating him about six months ago, so I guess he decided to just...get away from here.""

I looked down into my coffee. It was always rough, hearing about another parent going through something like that, because one horrible thought always floats to the top of your brain.

*What if something like that happens to my kid?*

""Don't worry."" Samantha said. ""I'm sure the house is fine and stuff, I just thought that you should know.""

""Thanks, Samantha, I appreciate the honesty.""

We moved onto lighter topics until it was time for Samantha and Evan to go home for dinner. I went upstairs and found the two boys sitting in the crawlspace together reading comics. It seemed a little cramped for the two of them, but they didn't seem to mind the tight space any. Evan pulled himself out and Ryan promised to see him again at school.

Later that night, I was getting ready for bed when I heard Ryan say something.

""See, I told you you'd like him."" There was a pause. ""Oh, I'm glad you like me too."" Ryan said.

I decided to be cheeky and lean down in front of where the crawlspace was. ""Yeah, you're both pretty alright kids.""

""Oh, hey Mom."" Ryan said. 

""Get to bed, Ryan."" I said. I heard Ryan shuffling on the other side of the wall. I turned off the lights and got in bed, and as I was drifting off I had a thought. 

*Why did Ryan sound surprised when I responded?*

  
The 'incident' with the crawlspace happened a week later. 

This'll sound strange, but I count myself lucky that I was out of work with a head cold when it happened. I was at home when I got a phone call from the school.

""Hello, is this Ryan's mom?"" A lady on the phone asked.

""This is she."" I said, my nose full of mucus.

""Are you sitting down?""

'I stood up and began to pace. ""Why do you ask?""

""OK, this'll be hard to explain, Miss, but something's happened with Ryan.""

""What's wrong?""

""He's gone missing. We need you to come in and discuss what's happened.""

My runny nose and cough were the furthest things from my mind. I got dressed and in my car in record time and drove like a madwoman over to the school. I stormed into the front office and gave the lady at the front desk a bit of a scare when I slammed my hand on her desk while she was working on her computer.

""I'm Ryan's mother."" I said as best as I could with my stuffy nose.

""Oh, yes, right this way, ma'am."" she said. She got up and unlocked a door behind her which lead to what seemed to be the administrative area of the school. I followed her down a long hallway until we got to the door to the principal's office. She knocked on the door. 

""Ryan's mother is here."" she said. 

The door opened from the inside, revealing the principal. He was an older gentleman, about sixty years old, with salt and pepper hair. 

""Hello, ma'am, I'm Principal Thorne."" he said, holding out his hand for me to shake. ""I'm sorry we're meeting like this.""

I shook his hand and stepped into the office. Inside there was also a security guard, a heavyset man with a large beard who was holding a laptop. I took a seat across the principal's desk and he sat behind it. 

""First of all, ma'am,"" he said, ""I'm terribly sorry about what's happened.""

""Where's Ryan?"" I said curtly.

""Well, that's what we're trying to figure out, but there are some...strange circumstances involved.""

""What do you mean?""

""Ferguson, if you could."" Thorne said, gesturing at the security guard. 

The security guard set his laptop down on the desk, opened it, and navigated his way through a few menus until he was in some kind of app that was connected through the school's security cameras. 

""Ok, so here's what we know."" Ferguson said. ""Around three hours ago, at 12:30, Ryan is in his math class with Miss Hayward.""

He enlarged one of the cameras. It showed a classroom full of young kids. I could see Ryan sitting right in the middle of them. A young woman drew shapes on a white board, trying to explain polygons or something like that. The timestamp showed that this footage was indeed from 12:30 that day.

""Now, Ryan asked to go to the restroom and Miss Hayward gave him permission.""

Sure enough, Ryan raised his hand. He and the teacher spoke for a bit, and then the teacher gave him a little hall pass and he left the classroom. 

Ferguson then swapped to another camera, showing the hall outside the classroom. Ryan walked outside and strolled down the hall for a bit until he found the restroom. Ferguson switched to another camera, this one closer to the restroom entrance, which clearly showed Ryan walking inside. Ferguson then hit fast forward on the video, skipping past five minutes. 

""Now, since Ryan took so long, Miss Hayward sent another kid to go and see what was wrong."" Ferguson explained. Sure enough, the footage showed another kid walking into the restroom. He stayed in there for about a minute before running back to the classroom. 

""According to that kid,"" Ferguson explained, ""Ryan wasn't inside of the restroom. Miss Hayward contacted me and the other security officers and we began searching the school.""

He switched between various angles, which showed him and a few other men in uniform checking classrooms and the halls for any sign of Ryan. According to the timestamps this search went on for two and a half hours. 

""That's when I had the thought to just go back and check the cameras,"" Ferguson said, ""and I found this.""

Ferguson switched back to the restroom entrance camera, rewound it back to when Ryan walked in, and then hit fast forward. The footage speed by, with only the occasional security officer or student passing by giving any hint that it wasn't a still image. He fast forwarded until the camera was caught up with the live feed. 

Ryan hadn't walked out of the bathroom at all.

""Now, we turned that restroom inside out."" Principal Thorne explained. ""The restrooms are designed to sit in the center of the school for ease of access and to make sure that a kid can't just, say, crawl out a window and skip school. To be frank, there is no way in or out of the restroom except through that entrance.""

""What are you saying?"" I said quietly.

""What I'm saying, ma'am, is...we just don't know where Ryan is.""

  
The police got called in. I gave them all the information they asked for, answered all of their questions, and was told I'd be contacted as soon as there was a development. I finally went home as the sun was setting. I weakly walked up the stairs and into my bedroom and flopped down on the bed. I closed my eyes and gave myself a moment to let the day's events catch up with me. 

Big mistake, because as soon as I stopped for a moment I felt the tears begin to run down my face. I took a moment to take some deep breaths. In the dead quiet after I exhaled, I heard something.

""Mommy...""

I shot up out of bed. That was Ryan's voice.

'Ryan?"" I said. ""Ryan where are you?""

""Mommy..."" 

I leaned down. It sounded like it was coming from the crawlspace. 

I decided screw it, if this was a psychotic break then I'd deal with it, but I had to know.

I ran around to Ryan's room and threw open the closet doors. I pressed the panel to open it. It slide away, and there he was.

He looked pale, like he'd been sick for days. His eyes were closed, and he was lightly tossing and turning as though he were having a bad dream. I gingerly reached inside and pulled him out, and once he was out of the crawlspace his eyes fluttered open.

""Mom....""

""I'm here, baby, I'm here."" I said. I held him tightly, as if he'd disappear again if I let go. ""You're safe now, you're safe.""

""Mommy,"" he said, his voice weak, ""my friend tried to take me.""

I set him down and looked him in the eye. ""Who tried to take you, sweetie?""

He pointed at the crawlspace. ""My friend. He lives in there.""

I looked at the opening to the crawlspace, and suddenly it all felt *wrong,* deeply wrong, like it shouldn't exist. I walked over and closed the panel. 

""It's OK, baby."" I said, hugging Ryan once more, ""he won't be able to hurt you.""

When I finally let go of him, I noticed he had something in his hand. 

""What do you have there, Ryan?"" I asked. 

He sheepishly handed the object to me. It was a small wooden slab painted a dark blue. 'Ms. Hayward's Class' was painted on it in yellow letters.

  
I called the police and informed them of the situation. They came by the house and tried to ask Ryan questions about what happened, but he never deviated from the same story he told me. He'd gone to the restroom and then 'his friend' had tried to take him, and then he woke up to me pulling him out of the crawlspace. 

I watched the officers as Ryan spoke to them, and I could see that they were realizing a few of the same things that I had. 

That a kid had somehow vanished into thin air when he shouldn't have been able to. 

That a kid had somehow then appeared in a crawlspace that could only be opened from the outside while his mother was home, and she'd never noticed. 

That said mother couldn't possibly be responsible because she'd never gone to the school to pick him up. 

I watched as the cops got more and more confused as they came to these realizations. Once they were done asking Ryan questions they told me that they'd contact me if there were any developments in the case, along with resources for child therapists in the area. 

Once they were gone I asked Ryan if he wanted to sleep with me that night, and he enthusiastically said yes. 

We both climbed into bed together, and once I was sure Ryan was asleep I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight and walked into his bedroom. I slid the panel aside and looked into the crawlspace. 

There was a small hole drilled into one of the walls, at about where eye level would be if Ryan was sitting inside the space. The hole should have opened up into my room. 

One small problem. 

I knew there wasn't a hole on my side of the wall. 

I walked around to my bedroom to double check.

No hole.

I walked back around and looked inside the crawlspace again.

Hole. 

I made my way into the crawlspace, slowly approaching the hole. I held my hand out over it. I could feel a hot draft coming through from the other side, wherever that was. I took a deep breath and put my eye up to the hole to look at the other side. 

I saw a single bloodshot eye staring back at me. Then I heard something, something that sounded like it was being whispered right into my ear by someone with rotten breath.

""*Give him back to me...""*

I got out of the crawlspace as fast as I could. I shut the panel behind me. Then I grabbed one of Ryan's long sleeved shirts, closed the closet door, and tied the doorknobs together with the shirt, all while saying a prayer that whatever that thing was would stay in there and never speak a word ever again. 

I got back into my bed with Ryan. I looked at him as he slept peacefully. It was the first time he'd looked relaxed all day. I held him tightly as I stared at the wall, the wall that somehow both had a hole and didn't, and I dared the thing I'd seen and heard to try and take my son away from me again.

  
It's been three days since then, and things have been tense since that night. I got all of Ryan's clothes out of the closet, keeping an eye on the panel as I did so, and put them all up in my own. I also got a bike lock and some zip ties and used them to keep the closet doors shut, and so far they haven't budged an inch. I'm trying my best to figure out how to get us both out of this house, but unfortunately a house isn't something you can just turn around and sell within three weeks. So far nothing else has happened with Ryan; he's been a little less active than usual, but I'm getting him a therapist and he's been sleeping in my bed every night so he doesn't have to worry about that...thing. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. I need to get us out of here, but that's gonna be easier said than done. 

What I do know is this.

No one messes with my kid while I'm around.

No one.

1jgy7wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuscleTwitch/comments/1jgy7wh/im_going_insane/,I‚Äôm going insane,"Around Tuesday this week, a muscle in my left arm started randomly twitching for short periods of time. At first, I ignored it. It‚Äôs happened before, went away and didn‚Äôt come back for a good while. However, this time, it kept coming back.

First time I tried to stop it, I just gave it a firm massage with my hands, and it‚Äôd go away. But it kept coming back.

Then, I was starting to get a little annoyed. When I‚Äôd notice the twitch, I‚Äôd grind that area of my arm against a corner, like the corner of my bed‚Äôs headrest or the corner of a wall, to really rub deep. Didn‚Äôt do jack.

By late Wednesday, I started getting irked. Usually it‚Äôs gone by now! So when I‚Äôd notice the twitch, I‚Äôd give my arm a firm shake, or even give it a quick punch. That seemed to do the trick, until it didn‚Äôt on Thursday.

By Thursday, I was getting pissed. It was SO distracting when I tried to do homework or draw, and it would come up every 5-30 minutes, so it was pretty frequent. By then, I started giving myself harder punches on the arm in hopes of doing something. Didn‚Äôt work.

Now comes Friday, and I genuinely feel myself getting angry when I feel my arm muscle twitching. I‚Äôve began repeatedly, harshly punching myself in the arm even when it really starts to hurt, until it stops, just for it to start up again shortly after, leading me to get even more pissed and I just hit myself harder. I think I‚Äôve gone and given myself a bruise, but I still punch it because jesus christ it‚Äôs getting on my nerves. 

How do people deal with this? When does it go away? I‚Äôve been so focused on when this damn twitch comes about, I‚Äôve noticed other muscles in my body gently twitching from time to time, but not to the extent of my arm. I haven‚Äôt had any coffee, haven‚Äôt worked out recently, I‚Äôve been taking vitamins and drinking water (that‚Äôs all I really drink to be honest), but it‚Äôs still here.

There is an established local coffee shop in town that has been operating since 2022. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve received mixed signals from them, especially after they partnered with a new bakery and introduced drinks similar to ours. We‚Äôve also noticed that when we post on social media, they tend to mimic our content, which is frustrating since we invest significant time and effort into creating unique offerings.

Since December, we haven‚Äôt been open due to the cold weather, and we also manage full-time jobs. Recently, we‚Äôve been questioning whether our presence in town is truly sustainable, as it often feels like we are in direct competition with them. However, our customers have expressed a strong preference for our coffee over the caf√© down the street, which reassures us that we have something special to offer.

To strengthen our brand and differentiate ourselves, we are considering a strategic shift‚Äîintegrating more of our Hispanic culture into our drinks and bakery offerings while continuing to develop fun and unique beverage options that resonate with our clientele.

We‚Äôd love any advice on how to navigate competition in a small town and effectively reposition our business to highlight our cultural influence while maintaining and growing our customer base.",1,1742610015.0,Entrepreneur,0,1.0,False
1jgy6jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/6Perks/comments/1jgy6jk/trailblazer_gods_wanderlust/,Trailblazer God's Wanderlust,"Why, hello there. Lovely day for a stroll in the woods, isn't it? . . . You should know by now what this is, but let us have this moment of peace. Look up there. Beautiful, aren't they? Three birds. One's building a nest. Over there, isn't that river so beautiful. Nature really is wonderful, isn't it? But I've experienced it all before. I've explored this world top to bottom. I've seen every beautiful inch of this world, but I want to experience more. . . But even more so, I want to leave this world with a gift before my departure. As many other gods have, I am offering blessings. I ask for nothing in exchange. Please accept my offerings to you, my fellow explorers. My gifts belong to all those who wonder and wander. 

These are the essentials or the freebies. Accept them as you will. 

The Trail Provides: 
No matter where you go or what you do, you will find what you need to survive. You will find good food, clean water, warm shelter, and good company on your walks through life. This blessing works best when adventuring or experiencing new things. A life without new experiences is seldom one worth living. 

Trophy Room:
Welcome. . . I made this pocket dimension. A place where you can keep trophies of your adventures, experiences, and whatever else you want. It will self organize everything for you, and is always cozy and warm. Within, you can find a few amenities. Good food, cigars, and as much tea, coffee, or alcohol you can drink. None of this can leave the room, but it's here for you to enjoy your victories. 

Right to Wander:
It's a right provided by me, when the first human took their first breath. One that was squashed and removed from your history books by those who would prefer you stay put. This, I will no longer allow. This is a gurentee that you will never be contained. That you will never be held against your will. 

Now that we've gotten those out of the way, I will now offer you something more. . . Pick one of these, and I'll be off. 

The Call to Adventure:
Randomly throughout your life, you will receive letters, phone calls, or run into new people. Each one will offer you new experiences or adventures you can go on, usually for some kind of reward. These experiences can be anything from helping open a restaurant to something akin to Indiana Jones. Rewards made via these adventures will, at minimum, afford you a very comfortable life. There is no upper limit to the power of artifacts or experiences you can find. 

The Open Road is Seldom Lonely: 
You, and any companions you pick up on your journey will become ageless, but not immortal. Any blessings that they have are shared with you and the other members of your group. This does include blessings from the other gods, I'm sure they won't mind. This does not give you a copy of their blessings, mearly a glimmer of it (Think being able to access another person's item shop, or being able to paint mini-figures and still have them work for the blessing). This blessing can only share up to ten blessings in this way, but can hold up to one hundred normally. 

Following in the Footsteps of Gods:
Perhaps you have lofty ambitions? For you, I give this. Less a blessing, more a challenge. Experience everything. If you can experience the world as I have, every beautiful inch from top to bottom, then I will grant you the ultimate boon. A jumpchain. It is I who decides if you have experienced it in full, and it is I who makes the terms of the chain itself. It will follow all the basic rules of jumpchain, aside from these modifications. You will be using the Personal Reality Supplement and the Essential Body Mod. As a further addition, if you have companions because of someone from The Open Road is Seldom Lonely, you may take them along as companions into your chain. 

That is all from me. The Open Road calls. Take care, my friends. . . Oh, but before I go, tell me of what you will take! Do so, and I will give you this, as an extra token of my gratitude. 

The Trailblazer Sigil:
While rare, I have friends in many places. Presenting this sigil to them will show that you are one of my friends and can be trusted. . . Do be warned, using this puts you under the rules of xenia. ",5,1742609999.0,6Perks,1,1.0,False

Obviously not for everyone, but no dog lover will be disappointed. The owner is very friendly as is the staff. There is always a ‚ÄúBark Ranger‚Äù with the doggos to make sure all are happy.

Got into centro 45 min later. Walked to aldea zama which took 30 miutes. Not a hard walk but some stretches of road are busy dusty and have no sidewalks. Once i got to aldea zama it was very modern and clean condo complex. Lots of sidewalks and lights. 

Stayed in a large airbnb condo in aldea zama. Lots of space but i didnt like it. Its now off season and the area was very quiet. Maybe 20 percent occupancy. Left after 3 days.

Went to beach district and stayed the remainder of my week at a beach hotel. Very cute place. Orchid beach house. Loved the charm and the staff. Felt very private and quiet. Lots of places to walk to in the area. Same cost as condo in aldea. 

Restaurants visited
Centro/aldea
Xibak - excellent steak house. Medium priced. 9/10
Fit a licious - good brunch spot. Good service and coffee. Medium priced. 8/10
En canto cantina- nice ambiance good service 8/10
Golden flower - slower service, okay food, medium priced, 6/10
Burrito amur - great taste, smaller sized burritos lower price 8/10

Antojitos la chiapaneca 2 - great street tacos. Loved the tostados. Very authentic. 15 peso tacos. Cash only. 20/10. No english there. 

Beach
Orchid beach club- good service, great beach seating, great menu, more pricy, 9/10. Recommend burger
La taqueria-great taco platter. Get the 12 taco dish for value and taste. Medium price 9/10
La malinche - messed up my togo order, dry meat. 5/10
Ukami sushi - tasty sushi very slow service high price very small portions 5/10

Tips
Rent a bike. I rented one from mexibikes and had a great experience. Rode maybe 20km a day. 10 usd per day rental.

Cabs are a rip off so negotiate. Cost me 30 usd to go from aldea to the beach and 75 usd to go from beach to tulum airport. Always negotiate price before. Dont let them put your bags in the trunk b4 a price is set. Confirm before leaving. Pay at the end. All run off meter and will take cash credit.

Bring a mask. The roads are so dusty. I developed a bad cough midway through from the kicked up dust 

Get ready to spend some cash. Lots of micro transactions everywhere. Want to see a cenote? Entrance fee, want to park bike here? 50 pesos etc.

Felt very safe. Only got heckled by some kids when i walked down a dark and dusty alley. Everyone was kind but expect to get the gringo price when dealing with street merchants. I didnt care because i can see that these people have a hard life and work for their means. 

The real danger is the environment. Roads are bad. So many pot holes. Trash is an issue. People will put up barbed wire to block off their property. Imagine walking at night after the bar and all of a sudden the side walk turns into a barbed wire fence. Be very careful when walking at night. 

Go marts are awesome for cheap coffee and sandwiches

I started therapy in January for this sometimes rocky relationship ( like 90% good, 10 % horrible).  Started researching narcissistic behavior /seeing a therapist. Therapist does not believe he has NPD BUT does narcissistic behaviors.  He needs constant validation re: his looks & the way he dresses etc. one thing I have noticed is he constantly is wanting to talk to girls half our age. Waitresses, coffee shop baristas etc..  A friend mentioned to me when we went camping as couples the men went to rent a 4 by 4 vehicle , the girl working was in her 20‚Äôs & attractive so my guy spent 45 minutes talking & flirting-the other guy kept saying we gotta go!!! THE other guy said to his wife it was weird! 

I have been suspicious so last week a neighbor ( 34 F & a model) and I went out for coffee & I asked her IF my guy has ever made her uncomfortable. She said yes, when she was introduced to him by another neighbor my guy said to her ‚Äú well if I was younger I‚Äôd ask you out‚Äù, she was completely creeped out & now she will not speak to him unless I am outside with him.   Tonight we went out to eat dinner & ran into a woman we knew from a coffee shop ( she‚Äôs 20‚Äôs).   Of course we talked to her but he said to me, do you two have each other‚Äôs phone numbers?

1jgxzoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1jgxzoq/friend34f_blocks_my_partner_36m_and_removes_me/,Friend(34F)  blocks my partner (36M) and removes me from seeing her public post to save herself from unwanted ‚Äúdrama‚Äù on her bday weekend.,"Im not sure how I should feel regarding any of this. Short story long, my friend and I shared a mutual friend who I started bringing around a couple of years ago. Me and the mutual friend had a falling out over some petty things and my friend chose not to take sides and maintain both friendships (fair). 

She sees me as her main bestfriend and she knew how much it affected me when me and our mutual friend had a falling out. anytime I would go to her for advice over it she would remain kosher and not really provide much insight or advice. Keep in mind, this mutual friend was very self absorbed and it was one of the main reasons we had a falling out because I chose my own peace and sanity over her choosing to remain in a negative state of mind living in victim mode. My friend would come to me continuously and complain about how annoying it was to have to give her the same advice every day about the same loser guy who left her. So fast forward to recently, she had a falling out with our mutual friend herself and came to me saying she felt embarrassed that she didn‚Äôt take my advice initially and would come to me constantly over issues she had surrounding the things that came up with her. I felt impartial about this because when I came to her with the same thoughts, she refrained from giving me any good advice because she wanted to remain friends with her at the time. But now that she was on the other side of that coin, she was finally ready to open up about it all. They have a birthday that is a day apart and recently the mutual friend was trying to reach out to her resolve things by sending messages and basically trauma dumping on her.  my friend reached out to me to complain about how she‚Äôs not into it because she‚Äôs not taking any accountability for her actions and just choosing to complain about dudes and she‚Äôs not for the unhealthyness. Not even two weeks later, yesterday I took my friend out as a surprise to do something cool for her bday, got her a gift and coffee. I noticed that the mutual old friend had posted a thoughtful post on her wall for her bday and brought it up that I saw it in a neutral way. She responded, I guess that‚Äôs her way of apologizing? Ahaha. Fast forward to today, my partner woke up and noticed he was blocked on social media from her. He had just wrote on her wall happy birthday the night before and she commented back a thankful message. I called her in the morning while she was on her way to her birthday trip and lightly asked her if she blocked my bf, her response was shock and denied doing that and blamed it on technical issues probably. I didn‚Äôt buy it and neither did he. 
My boyfriend reached out to her and asked her if there was something he did wrong and she responded that she regrets doing it but she just didn‚Äôt want me to see the birthday post she made about the old mutual friend she posted on her wall because she didn‚Äôt want to cause stress on her bday for herself as she thought it would upset me if I saw it. I looked at her wall and noticed there was no post so she purposely privated me from seeing it. I‚Äôm baffled because we just had a convo before her going on this trip a month ago about me having no hard feelings about if she chooses to have a relationship with her. I will admit, when our fall out initially happened I did have a hard time coping with how much closer they became, it was weird to me.I  just felt like boundaries were being crossed when she knew how raw my wounds were regarding that friendship and it felt like betrayal. BUT, we got over it by talking through it and it did take some deep convos but there was a breakthrough. A part of me has no idea how to take this information, like I once again feel a little betrayed. I take her out spend almost $100 on us get her a nice gift and she chooses to block my partner not even 12 hours later because she‚Äôd rather avoid issues, but this just seemed to cause issues ? I would never think to reach out on her special vacation and bombard her with a post. I made it clear we had moved on from that.. ",1,1742609394.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

So my Mom has a cousin who has bipolar disorder AND schizophrenia.  When she has episodes it can be scary.

So the cousin, I‚Äôll call her Betty, is now at a stage of her life where she‚Äôs VERY medically needy. So it‚Äôs looking like she‚Äôll have to go to the state hospital where her physical and psychological needs can be met.

Something I noticed is she has disjointed speech which I‚Äôve been told is common in schizophrenics.  I went to the nursing home with my Mom to see Betty and the whole time she was talking she kept switching subjects rapidly.  It was my coffee, my shoes, my coffee, my shoes, hi OP do you remember that dinner party?  Coffee, shoes, coffee, shoes.

My Mom didn‚Äôt understand why she does this.  Nor does the rest of my family.   I‚Äôm in a psychologist but I‚Äôve worked neuropsych with schizophrenic patients and I‚Äôve seen this before.  It‚Äôs normal for someone like her.  I‚Äôve tried explaining it to my family but they all said that sounds like ADHD.

DEPOT Experience 

Day 1
* Bus arrival is just like videos. Not too crazy but scary and stressful because of the yelling and no one knows what they‚Äôre supposed to do exactly. 
* They will ALWAYS find something wrong with something you‚Äôre doing, so getting yelled at is unavoidable. Get used to it. Embrace it. 
* Don‚Äôt make eye contact. 
* Know your recruit comms.
* The more you interact with the Company Commanders, the more comms practice you get. Get used to getting screamed at, it‚Äôs just noise. Just be as loud as you can. Even if you‚Äôre wrong about something, screaming your response will help minimize negative repercussions. 

Day 2-4
* Admin stuff, fitness test, medical & vaccinations, clothes issuance, fitting for your dress uniform & ODUs, etc.
* The fitness test is what it is. Practice before you arrive. Don‚Äôt count on adrenaline saving the day. Give yourself enough time to meet the fitness standards before your ship date. If you‚Äôre not suuuper overweight and out of shape, you should honestly be fine. We started with 43 recruits, and 31 graduated. Most were lost to the PT test, the others (1 or 2) were lost to medical disquals.
* Btw, maybe bring an extra duffel bag for all the extra stuff they give you. It didn‚Äôt all fit in the sea bag they give you.

Day 5-14

* You‚Äôre taking classes, getting familiar with your CG email, and other admin stuff.
* In between everything, you are getting drilled with IT (indoctrination training). This is circuits of full body workouts that go anywhere from 10 minutes long, to 3 hours (with water breaks and bathroom breaks in between). 
* IT includes pushups, burpees, v-sits, planks, mountain climbers, leg kicks, and I think a couple other workouts. All back to back, but only for like 30 seconds each at a time.
* It goes ‚ÄúPUSH UP POSITION‚Äù for 30 sec, then ‚ÄúON YOUR FEET‚Äù for 5 sec, then ‚ÄúBURPEES‚Äù for 30 sec, then ‚ÄúON YOUR FEET‚Äù for 5 sec, etc. something like that.
* You‚Äôll be holding your hands above your head for a very long time. You‚Äôll be holding your water bottle out in front of you for a very long time. You‚Äôll be holding a heavy plastic/metal dummy rifle in sniper positions for a very long time. You‚Äôll be holding a rope over your head too. And a mattress if you‚Äôre very unlucky. The max time allowed btw is 7 minutes by law, so keep that in mind if you‚Äôre sitting there wondering when you can drop it
* Somewhere in here, closer to the 5 day mark, you‚Äôll go to the store and get stuff you need for hygiene and uniform.
* Bring like $400 cash or be ready to spend that, because they charge you for your uniform stuff (~$325 alone)

Day 14 (aka second Saturday) 

* You will have Liberty for 06 hours. Enjoy it. It‚Äôs awesome. you go to liberty right before this and you can get snacks and stuff to consume during liberty.
* By this point your Lead CC should have debriefed. This is when they chill out and 90% of the IT and yelling stops. Your assistant CCs will debrief shortly after. It‚Äôs great and a huge relief.

Day 15-19/20

* You have admin like everyday. Plus classes to finish your courses on iPads. It‚Äôs super easy.
* Final exam is the last Wednesday. Open book/iPad. But go quickly because time runs out faster than you think.
* The assistant CCs debrief and it‚Äôs cool and they also chill out and when you‚Äôre in class together or in the squad bay, you can talk somewhat normally/no more screaming like mad men. But when you‚Äôre out on the regimen (marching, galley, quarterdeck, etc) you need to act like you‚Äôre still in week 1 and your military bearing is sharp as a whip. Don‚Äôt get too comfortable and start messing around. This will piss off your CCs.
* Pizza party is the night before grad. Pizza is wack, wings are ok. Don‚Äôt get too excited. That night, after pizza party, you chill out in your squad bay with your CCs and talk about highlights of training, bring up funny moments, and even do impressions of them. Super fun/funny.
Day 20 (Grad Day)

* although they‚Äôve stopped the IT by this point, they will likely wake you up as if it‚Äôs Week 1 screaming and make y‚Äôall do IT in the quarterdeck. it‚Äôs not bad at all though. It‚Äôs more of a formality/tradition and it‚Äôs over in like a minute. It‚Äôs more fun than anything. Embrace it and scream loudly. 
* Then breakfast. Then back to the squad bag to finish packing. Then clean the squad bays. Then get dressed and get uniforms checked. They‚Äôre super helpful with making sure you look crispy. Then off to grad. The end.

Tips:
* The Galley: it wasn‚Äôt too bad for my company. You will get approached and questioned or critiqued. Make sure to scream your recruit comms correctly, and power walk through that MF.
* If you wanna get good practice at getting yelled at but also practicing recruit comms, volunteer to be Yeoman. It‚Äôs a b-word and a half but it wasn‚Äôt thaaat bad. Your company will see you getting screamed at even though you‚Äôre doing your job well, and they‚Äôll respect you for it. It‚Äôs also not very labor intensive at all. Just remembering a few sentences for certain situations and you‚Äôre good. Plus you get access to the yeoman desk and all the supplies it contains.
* If u wanna take it easy, do literally any other job‚Äîexcept squad leader. They get yelled at about as much as Yeomen.
* Set your watch alarm for 5:00am. Get up, brush your teeth, shave, make your rack, then lay down and wait for 5:30. This will save you sooo much time in the mornings.
* Hygiene: bring 2 travel-size of everything. You won‚Äôt have to buy it at the CG store.
* If you can afford it, bring an extra v neck shirt, or hygiene products for your shipmates who may have forgotten them. This will help the group as a whole that why you‚Äôre not getting smoked for their mistake/forgetfullness.
* Shaving wasn‚Äôt that bad. I get a 5 o clock shadow around 2pm, but I was mostly able to get away with shaving once or twice a day. You just gotta shave in the AM and then after lunch. Unless you‚Äôre a werewolf or something.
* Galley food is good. You‚Äôll look forward to it. They‚Äôll allow you coffee in the final week and desserts too. Don‚Äôt be afraid of the sandwich/pb&j bar. Be the first to go. Your CCs might respect you more for it. 
* Learn the helmsman and recruit pocket guide thoroughly before arrival. Especially General orders, ethos, knots and what they‚Äôre used for, and Rates/Ranks/Collar Devices/Shoulder Boards. Everything else can be an afterthought but still learn it all. 
* They never did rack inspections but we made sure to make our beds every morning. Your first Sunday (day 8 I guess?), divine hours are from 0800-1300. This is when you will organize your rack according to recruit regulations. If not you, there will be other people in your company that will be gurus at this so just help each other out.
* Check on your shipmates. If you see someone crying or visibly sad, give them a second but then ask them if they‚Äôre alright. Tell em that you‚Äôre also hurting. It‚Äôs easy to feel alone, so doing this will reeeeeally make a positive difference. I saw two separate shipmates crying and later on that evening while cleaning, I asked if they were good and they said yeah (of course) but genuinely thanked me for asking and it helps bond the team together.
* If you‚Äôre sick, go to medical. If you have a fever, try to resist. They might keep you for a day or two and you don‚Äôt wanna miss required classes. If anything go for knee pain, and then You‚Äôll have ibuprofen for use in case of a fever. Take 250 or so milligrams of. Vitamin C per day for about a month leading up to DEPOT. I did this and I didn‚Äôt get sick at all, except coughing up phlegm. But everybody does because of how dusty the squadbay is. I felt completely fine the entire time though. One guy got Covid and had a fever of 105 but he was back after 2 days or so and he graduated. So it just depends.
* Don‚Äôt worry about dental unless your grill is effed up. My lying dentist said I had gum disease and a cavity. I got a deep cleaning before DEPOT but I didn‚Äôt get the cavity filled. Then when I saw the dentist at DEPOT, she said I had great oral hygiene and confirmed I did NOT have cavities. You can have like 5 or 6 though and they‚Äôll fill em for you. ZERO people got kicked out for dental in my company and some of them had some questionable grills. BUT none of em had really bad teeth either. Definitely some halitosis in the company lol but I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint who.
* Make a group chat during Liberty and follow each other on socials. NOTHING ROMANTIC THOUGH. Become friends. Ask about each others lives, jobs, families, childhoods. It‚Äôs fun and interesting. I truly feel like I‚Äôve made lifelong friends whether or not we actually plan on staying in touch. If I see someone from my company in 10 years not having spoken a word since grad, I‚Äôd be stoked and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd have fun catching up. Plus I got a friend in Guam, one in NY, one in Florida, etc so if I ever travel, I might have a place to stay, and if not, I‚Äôll at least have a tour guide haha
* You‚Äôre never gonna get to shower properly. You‚Äôre just not. Clean the essential areas, rinse off, and get out. This will help you meet time objectives. If the CCs say to be done by X-o‚Äôclock, BE DONE BY THAT TIME. This will save you from being smoked.
* Practice doing left face, right face, about face. Practice walking and squaring your turns. This will give them less to critique you on.
* In the first 8-10 days, you‚Äôre never gonna have enough time for anything. They do not give you enough time for anything ON PURPOSE. But still try to meet time objectives.
* They‚Äôre gonna threaten reversion (getting sent to 8-week bootcamp) a lot, but it never happened to anyone in my company. One guy did, but it was due to failure of PT test. You won‚Äôt get reverted for not knowing required knowledge. It‚Äôs a scare tactic. But, KNOW YOUR REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE because it will save your AND your company from IT.
* Don‚Äôt be afraid of getting your Tracker pulled. They claim to document discrepancies and mistakes but it‚Äôs another scare tactic. These apply mostly to the 8-week companies.
* They only have 20 days with you so they don‚Äôt necessarily have time to be anal about this and that. As long as you show effort and can decently demonstrate memorization of required knowledge, you‚Äôll be fine. There were at least 4 guys in our company who didn‚Äôt even know the general orders even by the end, and they made it through. Get your comms down and scream and again, you‚Äôll be fine.
* Beware of Petty Officer Pringle. He has a this but narrow mustache and he is no joke. Made our company miserable until his debrief. But we made it so, you know, it wasn‚Äôt thaaaat bad.
* Eat an Orange at every meal (for the vitamin C). You may want an apple or a banana but trust me. I didn‚Äôt get sick at all, so I feel like that means something.
* DM me with any specific questions! I love helping people!
* Apologies for typos but there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôm going back and reading this rant to check for typos.

* 7 ish weeks post ACL + meniscus on the right knee surgery
* 11 days post being cleared to weight bare on the affected leg

Post surgery: being someone who was always called ‚Äúhyper-independent‚Äù and struggles to ask for help b/c it makes me feel like I am weak (this is a something I deplore in myself), the 6 weeks of NWB were brutal. Like damn it I just want to walk to the bathroom on my own two feet when I had to pee in the middle of the night or bring my iced coffee from the kitchen to my desk on my own. But hey, I rolled with the first 6 weeks the best I could and learned that my body can adapt and make up things on your own (tip: wear a robe and then you can fit a water bottle in one pocket and another drink/snack in the other pocket).

It was the countless Reddit posts I read to remind myself that I‚Äôm not alone in this (s/o and thanks everyone) and re-wiring my brain to learn that *my* people do want to help‚Ä¶ it made the last 6 weeks bearable and a bit less isolating. It fueled myself to get better soon - that I had a community of people cheering me on and I wouldn‚Äôt disappointment them. I did my PT exercises every single damn day to a T, convincing myself that 6 week post-op appt with my surgeon will be a glorious day.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, taking those first steps again in the doctor‚Äôs office was great but I think I was silly to think I would just miraculously be able to walk normally again after a few days. I thought the post surgery pain + 6 weeks of NBW was going to be the toughest part (mentally)???

A few days after, I went into my PT appointment with only 1 crutch feeling like an athlete. I left the session back on two crutches. He said I‚Äôll get there soon but not yet. I felt set back but gave myself grace since it was only 4 days of weight baring again.¬†

I just left my 2nd appointment with the PT (11 days post weight baring), again, walked in with 1 crutch feeling even stronger than I was last week. I left the session with him recommending me going back to two crutches‚Ä¶ I was so emotional that I cried in my car, feeling defeated.¬†Going back to two crutches feels like I've gone back 100 steps. Let's bring back the robe I guess.

The whole healing process is such a mind fuck. I‚Äôve been doing the work but it just doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs been enough. It feels like my body is failing itself and it‚Äôs so frustrated. Just coming to say that healing isn‚Äôt linear. It takes time and patience. I‚Äôm reminding myself that *I* know that I‚Äôve done the work and *will* be enough. To me, the easy part was the post-op/first 6 weeks. The real fight is **now**. I am thankful to have the privilege to do this work, to be able seek exceptional care and re-build myself (physically AND mentally) through this.

First of all, I'm lazy and hate reading directions. I'm sure the answers is somewhere, but again --- lazy... 

I use the freshly ground coffee from a local roaster called Marin Coffee Roasters.  North Beach is the blend.  The grind it when I buy it.  Between my wife and I, probably 5-6 total 16 ounce cups a day.  My wife prefers a milder blend, so I guess we go for that taste.

Can someone offer a guided brew preset that'll just take care of this request?  Or point me to the right setup?

I met this girl in my University, she's an international student in my country so she started talking to me and I was explaining her how the University worked and many other things about the city. 

Over the course of a couple months, we became good friends, we meet in class, we sit next to each other, we go outside and have a coffee every now and then and we vent about life, studies and other topics, we've studied and did projects together, we have went out at night to bars together and we've met each other's friends and share mutual friends too. 

Almost every day of the week we see and talk to each other and she's told me she values our friendship alot and she's thankful to have found someone from here that spoke the language and could guide and help her around. 

Over the course of this last couple months I have began to develop very strong romantical feelings towards her and deep down, although I never expressed them to her directly, I believe she knows that. One time, after we went out at night, we were both drunk and after we both went our separate ways to our houses we started texting each other flirting among other stuff.

Deep down I know my emotions and feelings towards her aren't reciprocate, and it really kills me inside because I don't remember ever feeling such strong feelings for anyone else in my life, it might sound dumb because I've known her for 4 or 5 months only but she's genuinely so kind and talking with her I feel like I can be transparent, completely myself, and just 5 minutes of talking to her makes my day.. 

Today and the past few days we've met in person, we had good conversations and it was fun, but now when we text she just seems really dry to me, the complete opposite of what she is in person. She takes sometimes hours to answer and responds with 1 to 3 words and it makes me feel really bad. It might be a language barrier because I know her English is not the best, but I'm not quite sure.. 

I've been spending so much time of my days thinking about her and I wish I had the courage to vent it all out to her and tell her how I feel, but I'm too afraid of the rejection which I'm almost certain I will receive. 

It's being painful to not be able to get her out of my mind and I was thinking about giving us some distance and maybe cut our friendship for a while, because the more time I spend with her, the more I develop feelings for her, and deep down I know they aren't reciprocate, and its killing me inside. I just want someone to love me

## Maintaining Your Chemex: Cleaning and Care

Proper care ‚Å¢and maintainance are essential for preserving the life and performance of your Chemex.

*   ‚Å¢**Rinsing After Each Use:** Rinse the‚Å¢ Chemex‚Å£ with hot‚Äã water immediatly after brewing to remove any remaining coffee oils.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Wash‚Äå the Chemex with warm, soapy water‚Å£ and a soft ‚Å£brush. ‚ÄãAvoid abrasive cleaners that‚Å§ can scratch ‚Äãthe glass. ‚Å¢There are also dedicated ‚Äãchemex cleaner product options.
*   **Removing Stains:** For stubborn stains, use a mixture of ‚Å£baking soda and water or ‚Å¢a dedicated coffee cleaner.
* ‚Å§  **Proper Storage:** store the Chemex in a safe place to prevent breakage.
*   **Replacing Filters:**‚Å£ Only use ‚Äãgenuine Chemex filters to ensure optimal ‚Äçperformance.[[Explore Top Rated coffee chemex brewing on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=coffee chemex brewing)
## Chemex vs. V60: A Showdown of Pour-Over Methods

the Chemex and V60 are ‚Å§both popular pour-over brewing methods, but they offer distinct flavor profiles:

*   **Filters:** Chemex filters are thicker than V60 filters, resulting‚Å§ in a cleaner ‚Å£cup with less sediment ‚Å¢and ‚Äåoils. V60‚Äã filters are thinner, allowing more oils to pass‚Å£ through, resulting in a richer, more complex cup.
*   **Flavor ‚Å£Profile:**‚Äç Chemex coffee is known for its clarity, brightness,‚Äã and nuanced flavors.V60 coffee tends to be more‚Å¢ full-bodied and‚Äå bolder.
*   **Brewing Technique:** Both ‚Å¢methods require careful attention to detail, but the Chemex arguably ‚Å§demands slightly more precision due‚Å£ to its thicker‚Å¢ filter.
*   ‚Äå**Which is Right for You?** The ‚Äçbest choice depends on your personal preferences. If‚Äå you prefer a clean, bright cup‚Äã that ‚Äçhighlights the coffee's delicate flavors, ‚Å¢the Chemex‚Äå is an excellent option. If ‚Äçyou prefer a richer, more full-bodied cup, the V60 ‚Äåmight ‚Äåbe a better ‚Äãchoice.

*   **Choosing the Right Size:** Select a Chemex that matches your typical brewing volume. A 6-cup‚Å¢ Chemex is ideal for‚Äå brewing 1-3 cups of coffee,while an‚Å¢ 8-cup or 10-cup Chemex is better for larger‚Å§ batches. ‚Å£Also consider a Chemex hand blown model if aesthetics are particularly ‚Äçcritically important to you.

I‚Äôm currently a second semester freshman, and I‚Äôm not doing very well. My first semester grades were okay, but they were horrendous compared to that of other students in my program. I know it‚Äôs bad to compare yourself and everyone adjusts differently, but it‚Äôs crazy how bad I‚Äôm doing compared to other people with the same professors and resources. I also want to try harder but I‚Äôm just so tired. I have school from 8-5, and I‚Äôm a commuter student. I‚Äôm really tired when I get home and I want to get a good amount of sleep. I want to lock in but I also want to rest. I try to do work on my breaks during the school day, but there‚Äôs only so much you can do in an hour or two. I‚Äôm taking 20+ units and what sucks is that I don‚Äôt think my classes are even that difficult. I just can‚Äôt deal with the sheer volume of things and honestly I‚Äôm just so tired. I no longer have motivation and my body just wants to be asleep all the time. How do I fix this? I want the option to go to grad school so low grades aren‚Äôt really an option for me. I also don‚Äôt come from a wealthy family, so I need good grades for scholarships. How can I turn this around and dig myself out of this hole? I‚Äôm genuinely just so lost and tired I don‚Äôt know what to do. The subjects that I struggle with are the humanities classes that I‚Äôm required to take as a STEM major. This includes foreign language classes and history. The amount of readings and assignments are overwhelming, and it‚Äôs become very difficult to get myself to work on them. I obviously still do my assignments and study, but I‚Äôm aware that I don‚Äôt go above and beyond. I know it‚Äôs a discipline issue but I‚Äôm also just so tired. I‚Äôve been sleeping for at least 8 hours a night, but I still find myself falling asleep in my history classes. Coffee doesn‚Äôt work either. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on really I think my body is like shutting down and it‚Äôs taking a toll on my grades. How do I salvage this semester?",2,1742607092.0,college,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

After going on a pub crawl and losing my straight friend I was out with and leaving escape nightclub. I wandered through the streets and ended up buying a pack of Marlboro reds of some random man in the street for 10 euros I believe. Once I was able to make it back to my hotel I noticed I had lost my keycard and the receptionist was no where to be seen, my phone had just then died as well. 
I reluctantly go to sit by the canal edge sitting down to light up one of my cigarettes to then quickly realise I had also lost my lighter. 
Sat there drunk with no key, phone or lighter I wasn‚Äôt feeling to happy. 
I was going through Alot personally at the time and this trip was a way to cheer me up but at that moment in time I was not in a good position.  Then after a few minutes out of nowhere a blonde haired random handsome Dutch guy sits next to me and without saying a word hands me a lighter. I took it and lit up my fag returning the gesture by handing him one.  We started speaking and after I tell him why I‚Äôm sitting out on the edge alone.  He cheers me up telling some jokes and then suddenly but casually asks if I‚Äôm gay. I said yeah and he then says me too.  
After a short pause he says well you can stay at mine and I agree even though  the tho if it that this is probably a very bad and possibly dangerous idea as I only knew him for about a half hour.  We get a taxi and end up pulling up to the most gorgeous house I‚Äôve ever seen. We go in we sleep he cuddles me and in the morning he brings me coffee and a a cigarette.  We have sex and then after he says he has to make some calls for work but that I could stay as long as I wanted and make myself at home.  
I then got a call from my straight friends mum who isn‚Äôt heard from him so I had to leave to find him and make sure he was alright. I said my goodbyes to the nice Dutch man and kissed him good bye.  I have never seen him again.

Background

* MAGI is over the limit for Roth contributions
* I contributed $7k to my Roth early in 2024 (before I knew I would be over the limit)
* I have an existing Traditional IRA with approx. 80k of deductible money
* I have never completed form 8606 before
* I have a 401k plan that allows me to roll in outside IRAs

What I want to do:

1. Transfer the entire trad IRA to my 401k - ASAP
2. Recharacterize the Roth as Traditional ($7k) - Prior to Oct 15th
3. Backdoor the full traditional into Roth ($7k) - After number two, anytime in 2025, with the understanding I will pay taxes on the gains I rollover.

I know I can do these things (rollover IRA, and recharacterization), but my question is how this gets reported with my 2024 taxes. How do I explain via IRS forms that the deductible and non-deductible funds never mixed (I would complete the IRA rollover prior to the characterization) and are not subject to the pro-rata rule.

I had a disagreement with my gf /wife about something that wasn't even my fault.  She was acting different and I knew what was going to happen. She starting bring up something that has been a continuous occurrence throughout the months. When we met I made a few mistakes but not in the way you think I used tinder to find friends where I lived she lived somewhere else. We weren't daiting nor in any sexual or romantic relationship. She found out as she wanted to see. She downloaded the app and would use it see if she could find me . I just wanted friends for s coffee or anything I used the friends tab . For context I don't feel anh sexual attraction unless I'm in love . We talked about it and I explained what happened she said okay I understand but also one other mistake I made I wanted to gain followers soi looked for a video on how to do so . It said in the video the best way is to find outrageous content and mass follow everyone you see I did that then forgot.
She noticed and was really upset she said it was cheating. I've never been in relationship up untill now so I didn't know what was right or wrong and I know this was wrong what I did but I didn't do it in the way she interrupted. This happened more times than I can count and it got worse each time . During Christmas few days before it happened. I was in a call with her and she was talking about all the people she's going to talk with on tinder . Then would send photos saying sorry I'm busy . Know I know she isn't actually speaking to them she was just trying to hurt me and well it did. But I ignored it as I love her and don't want to hurt her even more than I already have . She later told me she gets panic attacks and that's why she acts like this . See I'm like a empty void when it comes to this I can keep it all down but I can fly back up at any point. It got very bad during the passing of my brother. During January I got message after message of death threats insults she wished for me to die my two sisters to die and my brother my mum everyone. She said I was like dad who tried to kill my mum she said I was like him yet I never raised my voice never called her a name and would stay up untill I passed out because Ioved her . I still love her I love her laugh her smile her cute little catch phrase everything. There's not one thing I don't love about her . She's everything to me . She said someone things that would break up a marriage. There's nothing she can't say that won't ever make not love her . I noticed she always wanted to make love after these disagreements idkw but we did . The dayu brother passed we had another disagreement she would make up these people she loved in the past and how amazing they made her feel not sexualy . Hearing this hurt hearing things about me any my family hurt seeing my self fall apart because she was my only comfort my only love literally everything she is my world . She spent days with me helping me though with the funeral she helped me say goodbye to him in his coffin and that meant alot to me . The day of the funeral she stopped speaking idkw she later told me she didn't know what to do . That was.the hardest day of my life and I honestly think I have PTSD from it . While later we had few more disagreements the usual insults and her doing more exsesive things . She made a video with a picture of me and out chat posted it on ticktock I miss read what she said because I took 20mg of a sleeping medince to help me sleep a very strong one and because I was fighting it stay awake I was completely out of it . She deleted it and said sorry  I forgave her I always will I said forever and I meant it . This sort of thing happened every week for nearly two months give or take a weak . Yesterday it happened again she asked for my logins to all my accounts and to delete them u deleted my Instagram like she asked and now she wanted my galary. I was trying to take a video of it but it wasn't working so I went to let her know and she would respond and I asked ??? I asked ??? When did I ask ?? . I would say I just letting you know . She asked for me to send ss of my galary and I did . She found a video of a girl now there's an explanation for this . I got banned of Snapchat and downloaded my data in doing so it downloaded all the videos i have ever been sent by other people. A person sent me this she doesn't like him and said I'm not a good person for talking to him . And it's my fault it's on my phone . I'm at such lost confused state rn I took 80 antihistamines to sleep but got afraid and thought I was heaving a heart attack. I'm in the hospital writings this rn. There's so much more she's done and has done for me she's incredible and I love her more than anything in the world I always will but it I hear the word girls one more time I'm going to go insane.

- Vibe: A fusion of Nietzsche, MacGyver, and that one uncle who //accidentally// built a nuclear reactor in his shed.  

- Skills:  
  - Martial arts savant (3rd-degree black belt in Shudokan, BJJ blue belt, kickboxing champ, self-taught Krav Maga enthusiast, nothing major). Yes, I‚Äôll teach you to disarm a man with a spoon.  
  - Homeschooled out in the hollows ~20 minutes south of Eugene~ by two adopted parents (114 combined years of instilling wisdom professionally) who turned me into a ""renaissance man"" by 12. I can debate Kant, rebuild a carburetor, and recite the periodic table in iambic pentameter.
  - Dropped out of Jesus High‚Ñ¢, ghosted society, then waltzed into public school last minute with enough credits to graduate twice. My senior year was jazz band, existential dread, and a diploma handed to me like a participation trophy.
  
  - Now: Making $[redacted]/year doing whatever I want (mostly coding, composing symphonies for my AI, and dismantling capitalism between coffee breaks).  

Seeking:  

- A 'playful polymath' who laughs at the void but still cries at dog rescue videos.  
- Someone who‚Äôs equal parts *sunshine and storm*‚Äîcan pivot from debating quantum ethics to wrestling me for the last slice of pizza.

  - Sparring sessions (verbal *and* physical).  
  - The fact I‚Äôve had PTSD from existentialism since preschool.  

Perks: 

- I‚Äôll serenade you with jazz flute *and* build you a blockchain fortress.  
-Our first date: Storm Area 51 (for the meme), then dissect ""Blade Runner 2049"" over gas station sushi.  
- Guaranteed to keep your therapist employed.  

Not Looking For:  

- Anyone who thinks ‚Äúdeep conversation‚Äù means ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your zodiac sign?‚Äù

I just want some advice/ideas about what happened to me last night. 2 days before this happened I had unprotected sex and it hurts so we stopped after like 10mins. I also drink coffee everyday so idk if that may have contributed to this. Last night I peed like usual, but then I was confused when I feel like peeing again but nothing comes out. It hurts when I try to force it. My bladder pressure continued the whole night and it was horrible since I felt like peeing the whole time. I was constantly drinking water to flush out my system, and I pee normally but the bladder pressure is still there. I immediatly presumed that it might be UTI. But today I feel like it hurts less than last night and the feeling of bladder pressure is mild.

My ex-husband (30M) and I divorced a little over a year ago, and let me tell you, the breakup was an absolute *trainwreck*. Think betrayal, lies, toxic arguments‚Äîeverything you could imagine. I thought once it was over, I could move on. But I was wrong.

It started out innocent enough‚Äîhe‚Äôd text me occasionally, asking if I was okay or if we could talk. I was so hurt, I didn‚Äôt want to seem cruel, so I‚Äôd respond. But then, things started spiraling in a way that made me question my own sanity.

It was subtle at first. One or two texts a week. And then, I started seeing him everywhere. The coffee shop I go to every morning, the gym, even my favorite bookstore. I thought it was just a coincidence, but when I started running into him *every time* I left my house, I began to feel... watched.

Then came the phone calls. Dozens a day. I blocked his number, but he‚Äôd always find a way to reach me‚Äînew numbers, private calls. No matter what I did, he wouldn‚Äôt stop. He started showing up in places I went, like he knew my every move. It wasn‚Äôt just coincidence anymore; it was *creepy*.

And it got worse. One day, I was walking home from a friend‚Äôs house, and I saw his car parked at the end of my block. He wasn‚Äôt in it, but the fact that he was *waiting* for me? I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I thought I was imagining things, but then it happened again a few nights later, and then again. Every time I left my apartment, he was there. Watching.

One night, I was out with friends, and when I came out of the restaurant, I saw him standing across the street, staring at me. I tried to ignore him, but when I got into my car, I noticed he was following me‚Äîdriving slowly behind me the whole way home. I freaked out, pulled over, and called a friend. I didn‚Äôt want to go back to my apartment alone, so I stayed at a friend‚Äôs place that night.

After that, I went to the police. They said they couldn‚Äôt do much without proof, but I filed for a restraining order, hoping that would end it. It didn‚Äôt. Not even close.

Now, he shows up at my job, acting like he‚Äôs just ""checking in"" on me. He‚Äôs somehow gotten friendly with my coworkers, even asking them if I was ""doing okay"" and if I was ""feeling better"" after everything that happened. One of my coworkers told me he‚Äôd been asking questions about my schedule‚Äîwhen I‚Äôd be working, what time I‚Äôd be leaving.

The worst part? He‚Äôs been emailing me. Under fake names, pretending to be other people. And these emails? They‚Äôre not just generic ""I miss you"" messages. He‚Äôs sending me detailed, obsessive notes about my life‚Äîthings I haven‚Äôt told him, things he couldn‚Äôt possibly know unless he was watching me 24/7.

It doesn‚Äôt stop there.

Last week, I went grocery shopping, and I looked up to see him standing at the end of the aisle, just watching me. When I tried to walk away, he followed me, but didn‚Äôt say anything. It was like he was trying to trap me into talking to him. When I snapped at him to leave me alone, he just smirked and said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run from me forever.‚Äù

I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôve changed my routine, I‚Äôve canceled plans with friends, I‚Äôm always looking over my shoulder. I feel like my life is no longer mine. I feel like he‚Äôs *everywhere*.

I‚Äôve tried to talk to a lawyer, but they say the laws on stalking are tricky, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs serious enough to get immediate help. I don‚Äôt know what to do next, and I‚Äôm honestly scared he‚Äôs going to escalate‚Äîmaybe even do something drastic.

Has anyone been through something like this? I just need to know how to make him *stop* before it gets worse. I can‚Äôt keep living in fear.

TL;DR: My ex-husband has been stalking me for months after our divorce. He shows up everywhere I go, sends creepy emails, and has even started talking to my coworkers to get information about me. I‚Äôve tried blocking him, but he won‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to escalate.",11,1742605879.0,TrueOffMyChest,12,0.79,False

Initially I tried to fully clean the glass with this but it was barely better than windex alone. So I completely clean the glass first with windex and then put a nickel-size dab of this on a clean-ish microfiber towel and fully 'polish' the inside glass well with it. It takes very little, and as a result, makes it very easy to clean with windex the next time. I use a dab of this after every cleaning.

1jgwpvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NightmareNexusYT/comments/1jgwpvv/the_lights_beyond_the_field/,The Lights Beyond the Field,"I moved into my grandfather‚Äôs old farmhouse in late September, just after his funeral. It sat on the edge of a nowhere town in Indiana, surrounded by thick woods and a massive cornfield that stretched further than my eyes could see. It was quiet. Too quiet. And at first, that was what I loved about it. After years in the city, the silence was peaceful.

But then I started noticing the lights. Faint, soft at first, like a lantern in the distance, deep within the corn. I figured it was just a neighbor or some farm equipment left running. But every night, around the same time, they‚Äôd return. Not in the same spot, and not in the same color. Blue one night. Pale green the next. Sometimes pulsing. Sometimes still.

Curiosity became a routine. I‚Äôd stand at the back porch with coffee or whiskey, just watching. They‚Äôd flicker like fireflies, but too steady. Too deliberate. I started marking them down, sketching rough positions. Then one night, I saw something that stopped me cold.. One of the lights wasn‚Äôt hovering. It was walking. Moving with a rhythm, almost human. But too tall. Too smooth.

After that, things changed. My clocks stopped working. My phone would lose signal at exactly 9:47 PM. Once, I heard my own voice whispering from the living room when I knew I was alone. Another time, I blinked and found myself standing in the kitchen with dirt on my boots, not remembering how I got there.

I decided to find out what was happening. I packed a flashlight, notebook, and an old radio my grandfather kept by the door. It still worked, sort of, and picked up strange static patterns. I crossed the backyard, heart pounding, and stepped into the corn.

The rows felt tighter than I remembered. The air was dense, like walking underwater. Every few steps, I‚Äôd glimpse a light between the stalks, flickering just out of reach. Then I found it. A clearing, perfectly circular, untouched by corn or weeds. In the center stood a ring of lights, pulsing gently, almost breathing.

I stepped forward. The lights pulsed faster. The radio screeched with static, then a single word: ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù I dropped it. Something cold brushed past my shoulder. I turned, but nothing was there. Just silence and swirling color. I don‚Äôt remember leaving the field. I remember closing my eyes.

When I woke up, I was back in the farmhouse. Everything looked normal. At first. But my reflection didn‚Äôt blink when I did. The clocks were all frozen at 9:47. And when I picked up the radio, it whispered one word over and over.. My name.

I didn‚Äôt feel rested. It wasn‚Äôt like waking from a dream. It was like being dropped into my body after someone else had borrowed it.

The house felt unfamiliar. Like it had been copied from memory and rebuilt slightly wrong. The furniture was in the right places, but the shadows weren‚Äôt. My coffee mug had my name spelled wrong. The old photograph of my grandfather, his eyes looked directly into the camera now. They hadn‚Äôt before.

I tried to convince myself I was just shaken. Maybe I‚Äôd sleepwalked into the field, had some weird stress-induced dream. But every time I tried to explain it away, something else would happen. The TV would turn on by itself, playing static with faint whispers beneath. My phone would restart and display old texts from people I hadn‚Äôt spoken to in years, except the messages weren‚Äôt the ones I remembered sending.

One night, I looked out into the field and saw the lights again, only now they were closer. Instead of a flicker in the distance, they hovered just at the edge of the backyard. Watching. Waiting.

I tried to leave the next day. Packed a bag, jumped in the truck, turned the key. The engine started, then died. I called a tow service only to get no answer. I tried calling a friend to come pick me up. My phone only rang in my own house. I stood in the kitchen, hearing my own voice faintly echoing from the bedroom.

I stopped sleeping. I started hearing scratching in the walls at 9:47 every night. That time. Always 9:47. The lights would pulse once, like a heartbeat, and the radio would whisper something new each time. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go back.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe see you.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlmost ready.‚Äù

Almost ready for what?

I decided to destroy the radio. I smashed it with a hammer and threw the pieces into the woods. That night, I found it back on the table, perfectly intact, playing the same static. The whispers had changed. Now it said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already gone.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think I ever left that field. Maybe I‚Äôm still standing there, surrounded by the lights. Maybe this version of me, in this house, on this land, it isn‚Äôt real. Or worse, maybe it is, but I‚Äôm not.

Tonight the lights are closer than ever. They‚Äôre at the back porch now, casting long, thin shadows through the windows. I don‚Äôt see shapes in them, but I feel them. Like they‚Äôre pressing against the edge of reality, looking in.

I tried to write this all down to prove to myself that I‚Äôm still real. That I still have thoughts that belong to me. But as I‚Äôm finishing this, I just noticed the time.

It‚Äôs 9:47.

And the lights are in the house.

They stayed in the house that night. I heard them, soft footsteps that didn‚Äôt quite touch the floor. The hum of something electrical just beneath the surface of sound. When I passed a mirror, I saw something behind me, but when I turned, the hallway was empty.

I don‚Äôt think I slept. But the next morning, the house felt normal again. Almost too normal. Birds chirped outside. Coffee brewed. The lights were gone. For a moment, I convinced myself it was over. That maybe I had snapped, and this was me getting better.

Until I checked the footage.

My grandfather had installed a cheap security camera by the back door. I had forgotten it even existed. Just out of curiosity, I pulled up the feed from the night before. For hours, the porch sat empty. Then, at exactly 9:47, the video glitched.

It came back a few seconds later, and the porch was full of figures. Dozens of them. Tall, too tall. Thin and pulsing faintly. Their heads were tilted, like they were listening to something. Or waiting. One by one, they began to walk toward the house.

Then the camera cut out.

When the feed resumed again, they were gone. But I wasn‚Äôt on the video either. Not once, all night. It was like I hadn‚Äôt existed.

That broke something in me.

I left the house, ran out the front door without shoes. The town should‚Äôve been ten minutes away. It wasn‚Äôt. I walked for what felt like hours. The trees didn‚Äôt change. The sun didn‚Äôt move. Eventually I saw a gas station and ran inside.

It wasn‚Äôt the same as before, but the man behind the counter was.

Same voice. Same look in his eyes.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run from them,‚Äù he said, like he‚Äôd been expecting me. ‚ÄúThey followed you home. You let them in.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt let anything in.‚Äù

He stared at me for a long time. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

When I got back to the house, the front door was open. My coffee was still hot. The lights were already waiting in the hallway, like they‚Äôd missed me.

That was three nights ago.

Now every mirror in the house shows something different. A version of me that moves a second too slow. A version that doesn‚Äôt blink. One that smiles when I don‚Äôt.

I think they‚Äôre trying to replace me. Piece by piece.

If anyone finds this, don‚Äôt come looking.

There is no town.

There is no map.

And if the lights find you, they will follow you too.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1742604825.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.

1jgwfv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1jgwfv2/back_in_normal_range/,Back in normal range,"Back in October I got a high cholesterol result. I changed my diet and now am back in normal ranges and improved my HDL.

Note I was already vegetarian, but ate a lot of eggs and butter and cheese and whole milk. My first measure was unfasted, most recent one fasted.

* completely quit egg yolks, switched to egg whites
* no more whole milk for coffee, soy milk instead
* generally switched to toast with peanut butter for breakfast
* more nuts
* oatmeal several times per week. I substitute it for pasta or rice and make like a savory bowl
* even more beans üí™
* started supplementing 6g fiber, and fish oil

When I first got my results I was very scared and this subreddit really helped me formulate a plan, thank you.
