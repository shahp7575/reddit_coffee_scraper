Who relates?,"I've gone thru bouts of paranoia thru the years, although no delusions. Ive been through some pretty traumatic things though and perhaps thats why. Its only recently ive started considering if my paranoia has been more leaning towards something like schizophrenia. For example, ive had moments where ive left my coffee down at work while i went to do some work, and wouldnt drink it when i returned because i was afraid somebody could have posioned me. Ive had that same paranoia several times. The thing is everytime im aware how foolish it sounds, so like maybe thats just an anxiety thing? Ive gone down the rabbit hole of psychotic illness research months ago when i was deep in a spiral. I have been told by a psychiatric nurse and my psychiatrist that i dont have those disorders, and i dont necessarily believe i do. I guess im just afraid maybe i dont have it *yet* .. lol.

1hsftx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhDStress/comments/1hsftx8/what_i_learned_from_my_phd_journey_lessons_i_wish/,What I Learned From My PhD Journey: Lessons I Wish I Had Known to Make It Through and Avoid Burnout,"I’ve been ABD (All But Dissertation) for longer than I ever imagined, and my PhD journey has been one of the hardest chapters of my life. Between clinical depression, severe burnout, financial stress, and life challenges like divorce, quarantine, family crises and managing mental health, I’ve had to learn the hard way how to navigate this path. Looking back now, I realize there are some lessons I wish I had learned sooner. Lessons I wish someone would have told me and that I want to share for anyone else going through a difficult time.
1.	Your mental and physical health is the foundation of everything. For too long, I neglected my own well-being in the name of pushing through deadlines and expectations. This left me burnt out, stuck, and unable to function. I now realize that prioritizing my health whether through therapy, exercise, or just giving myself permission to rest isn’t a weakness; it’s essential. You’ll work more effectively and with more clarity if you’re not running on empty. Stop telling yourself you’ll take care of yourself later because later won’t come if you don’t allow for it.

2.	Work-life balance is a necessity, not a luxury. The PhD can feel like it demands everything from you, but the truth is, it doesn’t have to. I regret sacrificing hobbies, social connections, and simple joys because I thought I didn’t have time for them. Worst of all I sacrificed my health. In hindsight, these things are what fuel you to keep going. A walk, a coffee with a friend, or a creative project outside of your research can make all the difference.

3.	Your perception of how others may see you doesn’t define your worth. My advisor didn’t advise me much, and that lack of guidance made me question myself constantly. It’s easy to internalize that kind of experience, but I’ve learned that your value as a person and a scholar isn’t determined by other people’s opinion. Other people can’t see your additional and unique struggles whether that is learning disabilities, language barriers, financial problems, family or life crisis, or mental or physical health problems. Your journey is unique to you and just because additional struggles can slow your progress doesn’t mean it devalues your research or your abilities. Your journey is as unique as it is yours meaning that your pace can be unique to you. Feel ok with your progress rather than constantly berating yourself for it. Seek support from peers, mentors, and communities outside your immediate academic circle. They can remind you of your strengths and give you the perspective you need.

4.	Redefine success for yourself. I used to think success meant perfection: finishing my PhD quickly, landing the “perfect” academic job, and meeting all the expectations I placed on myself. But I’ve learned that success is personal. For me, it’s about balance, making an impact where I can, and living a life that feels meaningful. Don’t let someone else’s definition of success dictate yours.

5.	The PhD is just one chapter, not the whole book. For a long time, my identity was tied to my PhD. I couldn’t imagine life beyond it, and that mindset made every setback feel catastrophic. It’s taken time, but I now see my PhD as one part of my journey, not the entirety of who I am. If academia doesn’t end up being the right path, it’s okay to pivot. Your dissertation doesn’t define your success. Most do not make it this far. Be proud of what you have already learned and achieved. 

If you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed, I want you to know you’re not alone. It’s okay to take a step back, to prioritize yourself, and to move forward at your own pace. The PhD is a marathon, not a sprint, and finishing doesn’t have to mean sacrificing your happiness.

What helped me most was realizing that I didn’t need all the answers at once or know exactly where I was going. I focused on small, manageable steps and tried to reconnect with the things that made me happy outside of work. When I began doing that everything began falling into place. Wherever you are in your journey, I hope you can find space to do the same.

You’ve got this! Remember to be kind to yourself, prioritize your health, and respect your unique journey and pace. ",1,1735884577.0,PhDStress,0,1.0,False

So, I recently went through the whole SOC 2 process for my company, and let me tell you—figuring out the **scope** is where it all begins. Get it right, and you’ll save yourself a ton of headaches down the road. Get it wrong… well, you’ll probably end up paying extra for stuff that doesn’t even matter. 😅

Here’s what I’ve learned (the hard way):

# What the Heck Is SOC 2 Scope?

In simple terms, it’s about deciding which parts of your business the SOC 2 audit will cover. Think of it as the “what we’re auditing” list.

For example:

* If you’re a SaaS company, your production environment? It's definitely in scope.
* Your office coffee machine? Probably not (unless it’s storing customer data, lol).

# How to Nail Your Scope

1. **Focus on Customer Impact** Ask yourself: what systems or processes directly touch customer data or services? Those are your priorities.
2. **Map Your Data Flow** Take a step back and sketch out how data moves through your org. Anything handling sensitive info is a candidate for the scope.
3. **Pick the Right Criteria** SOC 2 has five Trust Service Criteria: You don’t have to choose all five—just the ones relevant to your business.
   * **Security:** Always required and It's Important.
   * **Availability:** For uptime promises.
   * **Confidentiality:** For sensitive data.
   * **Processing Integrity:** If you’re processing transactions.
   * **Privacy:** For personal info.
4. **Don’t Forget Vendors** If you’re using AWS, GCP, or any third-party services, you’ll probably need to include them too. Double-check that they’re SOC 2 certified or have equivalent security measures in place.
5. **Talk to Your Auditor Early** Seriously, your auditor is your friend here. They’ll help you avoid surprises later.

# Mistakes I Made (So You Don’t Have To)

* I initially scoped in some internal systems that didn’t even touch customer data—a big waste of time.
* I forgot to include one of our integrations in the scope, and yeah, that was a fun conversation with the auditor.

# Final Tips

* Start small for your first audit. You can always expand the scope later.
* Document everything. Even if you think you’ll remember, you won’t.
* Consider using tools like Vanta or Drata—they make life so much easier.

1hsfoke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hsfoke/should_i_switch_schools/,Should I Switch Schools,"
I’m looking for an outside perspective on my situation. Writing it out might help me organize my thoughts and make a final decision.

Background
	1.	Elementary School:
	•	I attended my zoned school for one year, but it was a terrible experience where I was treated horribly.
	•	My mom transferred me to a better school across town. It was 30 minutes away compared to a 3-minute drive to the zoned school.
	2.	Middle School:
	•	I attended an academic magnet school, which required high grades to get in.
	•	The school was downtown, while I lived on the outskirts.
	•	I took the city bus every day, waking up at 5:30 AM and getting home at 4 PM.
	3.	High School:
	•	I chose an arts-focused magnet school instead of continuing to the corresponding academic high school.
	•	Before high school started, we moved farther away, making the commute an hour.
	•	Freshman year, I took the city bus, waking up at 4 AM and returning home at 5 PM. Balancing this schedule with chores and homework became overwhelming.
	4.	Current Situation:
	•	School has become too much for me. I wanted to switch to homeschooling to finish high school early, but it’s too expensive.
	•	My mom and her boyfriend suggested I transfer to my zoned school in this new city.

Key Details
	1.	Art School:
	•	Pros:
	•	I enjoy having the freedom to walk around the city, grab coffee, and visit my boyfriend, who lives nearby.
	•	My mom loves my boyfriend, and our families are close—we’ve been together for over a year and even spend holidays together.
	•	Cons:
	•	The bus station I use to get to school is unsafe. I’ve had encounters with older men and drugs. Some incidents were serious enough to involve the police.
	•	The commute is draining: waking up at 4 AM and getting home at 5 PM leaves me exhausted.
	2.	Zoned School:
	•	Pros:
	•	I’d have more time at home, could get a part-time job, and eventually drive to see my boyfriend (I’ve passed my permit test and just need to practice).
	•	Cons:
	•	I’ve never been to a “regular” school before. All my previous schools were small and specialized, with specific groups of people and focused environments.
	•	The zoned school has 1,600 students (compared to 600 at my art school), and I’d likely encounter racism and drama, which I’m not used to and would struggle with.

What I’m Struggling With

There are so many pros and cons for both schools.
	•	If I stay at the art school:
	•	I selfishly want to stay because of my boyfriend, but I know I’ll keep telling myself, “Just one more semester,” like I’ve done for the past few semesters.
	•	If I switch to the zoned school:
	•	While it would give me more time at home and reduce my stress, switching mid-year and adjusting to such a different environment feels overwhelming.

I was ready to switch schools, but now I’m having doubts. Any advice would really help as I try to figure this out.

P.S. this could be a chance for me to make friends and restart band (i have zero close friends at my art school) im worried itd be atteacted to the wrong group of people",1,1735884017.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Then I got married, moved abroad, had 2 miscarriages within the last 2 years and my job is quite demanding and hectic. 

Every single time I come home, my mom finds a way to link everything that I do as an excuse to say I got fat. (Skipping breakfast, having coffee on an empty stomach, a supplement).

I’m home for December holidays and last week she said that our cat won’t sit on my lap as my body is too fat for her to sit. 

I got into an argument even today with her and she said her intention is not to call me fat and it’s only cause she raised me she is concerned. She is quick to play victim and makes me look like I’m overreacting.

I don’t know what to say or do anymore. I’m really mentally exhausted and I also do have a temper. 

I’m aware that I need to loose weight and I workout regularly plus I understand it’s a journey and will not happen overnight. But this mental stress of calling me fat every time she sees me is really getting into my last nerve. ",3,1735883821.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Do you prefer straightforward females? 

I’m assuming you’d prefer straightforward females because they require less energy to interpret. Engaging in a conversation with a shy female would require energy and require interpretation. From my last post, it seemed that the female should be straightforward. I’m an e6w5, INFP.

I can be shy, depending on the situation. At some times, I can be forward, funny and engaging. I gave the e5 I’m interested in a small gift tonight but I was feeling shy and tired. I’ve given him a few gifts lately, like snacks. Tonight it was something he needed (a coffee mug) which I got from a store as a freebie, after I’d purchased something. I might have felt shy because we were alone in a room together.

He said ‘you keep giving me things!’, ha. It could be that he was tired too, and he didn’t know what to say. Who the heck knows. I could have said a host of things or engaged in a conversation. Instead, I just kind of slithered away, embarrassed.

Anyway, back to my question. Are shy females bearing gifts less interesting to you than more forward females, bearing ideas?

I’ll probably see him this weekend and will do my best to seem curious, slightly engaging and less weird.

1hsfjsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hsfjsh/what_does_this_mean_did_i_trigger_him/,What does this mean? Did I trigger him?,"I’ve (28) been dating this guy (31) since mid November I see him consistently every week. We slept together on our 3 date after an amazing date but we were drunk and stopped he also shared with me that he is on antidepressants and it’s hard for him to finish but regardless we had a good time. 

Something to keep in mind he has never been in a relationship he has mentioned all his situations are fiery right away and fizzle out fast at about 2 weeks. He has mentioned to me that he thinks he might have a connection issue because his mom was very emotionally neglectful his whole life that he had to cut her off a couple years back to not enable her behavior any more. I also come from a toxic family and was in an extremely abusive long term relationship and have suffered from SA as a child and other moments through out my life. 

He is looking for a long term relationship as he wants to get married and have children and he mentioned wanting that and I want that too. We have seen each other every week since our first date back in mid November and slept with each other a total of 3 times but this last time when we stopped he asked me if that was awkward? I told him a bit yeah but i’m kind of awkward ( i need time to be fully comfortable with s*x) he starts to go straight to “oh maybe this isn’t going to work out cause I usually want to rip someones clothes off but I don’t feel like that with you” and he mentioned not feeling anxiously attached to me which is uncommon he said he usually feels anxious about whoever he is talking to and anticipating their text or be more flirty and cutesy but he doesn’t feel anxious with me like that. He mentioned this to his therapist and was told that our situation sounds healthy but he was still saying “i’m sorry but idk”. Then I told him “okay I don’t want to sound rude but you sound like you’re just self sabotaging you have never been in a relationship before and your first response was to react this way instead of communicating with me that maybe we should stop having s*x and focus more on getting to know each other.” Keep in mind he would also get weird whenever I was nice to him like offering him a cup of coffee or make him some breakfast he would tell me he feels weird because no one has ever done that for him. Idk if that says anything but I want to add it in there. 

Back to our conversation where I mentioned he seems to be self sabotaging he looked so sad and when I ask if he’s okay tears start coming down his eyes and he explains to me that yeah maybe he is because he does have mom issues but he’s never looked at it this way that he could be self sabotaging and he started to say he doesn’t understand why he even said that why he acted so impulsively he didn’t need to say that or act that way. He asked me if I’m insecure or if I ever been SA’d and I told him yes I am insecure about my body and that I have been abused he apologized and mentioned that he can try and make things feel safe or more comfortable for me which I appreciated. im crying at this point too cause I was triggered. I can’t remember if I told him before or after what he said but I mentioned how I’m also triggered because I thought I was safe with him and he is now showing me that he’s not who I thought he was by unloading such hurtful comments. I was a bit hurt when I said the things I said at this point but I mentioned how i’m tired of taking the role of the person trying to fix things or find solutions and here I am doing it again because I mentioned how he should have just communicated that he felt the awkwardness and we can take some time from that cause I also mentioned i’m use to it being awkward at first for me it always has been and he’s just use to hook ups so he’s more comfortable sleeping with someone without building that intimacy first. He started to hug me and tell me that he’s sorry and he agreed he should of communicated with me.

So now here we are at this point where we agreed to just get to know each other more but I feel so uncomfortable. Now I’m anxious I wasn’t before when I thought this was healthy I feel not good enough for him to want to “rip my clothes off” and that he’s not anxious about texting me like being flirty or cute with me sending me cute goodnight texts as he mentioned. Now I want to run away which sucks because the main reason I really like him is because I admire him as a person so much I love how he thinks and his emotional vulnerability, he is so smart and he cares about the same things I care about but now i’m second guessing myself and if he actually likes me because before this situation I thought he did like me he was excited to do things with me, he bought a PS5 because I got him into fortnite and we started playing together he would call me cute names and make certain comments like he saw me in his future in that way and then we had s*x this third time we couldn’t even kiss cause i’m sick so that added to my awkwardness but now I’m wondering if he only really likes girls who are not so into him. Am I triggering something in him?

If this is how you run a business then you need to go back to school because this is not how you should do it. Your entire team is burnt out, no one here models the standards, you focus on all of the negative that this amazing team does and none of the good. Who ever is making the schedules is not doing a very good job considering she’s scheduling some partners 1.5 hour shifts. But you know what I’m not sorry, because you hired people that you said was going to make this an “amazing team” but I have not seen that at all you have partners who have ncns more than 6 times, SSV’s who are on a power trip, baristas who are being infantilized, and people who don’t talk to management because none of their voices are being heard. The way you talk to partners is horrible. They are all scared of you because you count loudly in their faces if they aren’t fast enough. 

You don’t even know your night crew baristas because during an interview with one for a shift position as an internal promotion you introduced yourself as a completely new person and asked them to introduce themselves, that’s honestly embarrassing for you. I love Starbucks and I love coffee and people but this store honestly needs to be shut down, send your partners else where for the time being but it’s going to explode right in your face when no one on your team communicates with one another and they hate each other. And I’ll be there holding the popcorn because it’s going to happen and it’s going to happen soon with the environment happening here. And since we were talking about values earlier [redacted] I want to make sure you knew that you have never made me or other partners have a sense of belonging or joy in this store which is a main focus here at Starbucks.

1hsfcry,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hsfcry/aita_for_not_wanting_11_dogs_and_an_elderly_lady/,"AITA for not wanting 11 dogs and an elderly lady at 19? (Extremely long, but advice REALLY needed)","The title is exactly what it is. For a little backstory I have been living on and off with my grandma for 19 years. Why I was legally living with her on paper after she got custody of me when I was a kid, I often ran away or couch surfed throughout my childhood. When I was home I was getting abused emotionally or psychically as well as mentally by my Uncles why I was having to take care of my grandma. 

I legally had to leave my home when I was 18 leaving behind 2 dogs after my Uncle attempted to strangle me to death he was charged for it but I went to live with my estranged mother who took control of the situation and somehow the charges were dropped against him. 

Long story short, my Mother was just like my Uncle so I moved out and later moved in with my future fiance and his parents (20M).

After a year, me and my grandma began talking again slowly reconnecting. I was lonely and did want some of my own family despite having built a whole new family and a small healthy community. Well around Christmas I noticed my grandma wasn’t answering. After a week, i got a message from my mother. My grandma evidently had cancer and there were drugs being ran out of her house. I knew my Uncles had issues with drugs but I know I can’t always trust my Mothers word. Well, I quickly jumped to find the truth out myself because I know how ruthless and scandalous my mother can be.

Evidently, long story short my Mother and my Aunt had banned together. In the short time of 24 hours my Grandma had reached out to my Aunt (Im going to call her Aunt Steph) about a tenant on her property who was taking advantage of her and being cruel. My aunt steph reached out to my other aunt (Aunt T) and Aunt T banned together with my Mom to go to Florida which is where my grandma lives. My mom drove from Texas where she lived with my little siblings to go fight a tenant. why she was in florida she had destroyed the electric meter, Abandoned 2 of my grandmas dogs, argued with my grandma to take her back to texas without any of her clothes or shoes. My Grandma at the time had the flu and this is why she sought help with dealing with the unruly tenant. 
My Grandma’s phone later was taken from her and my Mom and Aunt T had spread so many different stories throughout the family that nobody knew what was going on and nobody could reach her. My mom told one side that my grandma had cancer later spinning it that she was on drugs and being chased by the police for trafficking and conspiring to murder someone. 
Hours Later I raised my alarm about my grandmas wellbeing along with some other family. When I raised alarm it seemed like they attempted to lock down control saying that my Mother had power of attorney and she owned the property which wasnt true as my name was on the house and it costs lawyers to add or remove a name from a property because I checked with the lady who my grandma bought the house from. My Mom was not present during that sign off. 

Seeing as I kept regular communication with my grandma I knew she was coherent by law and that none of them had power of attorney because automatically it goes to my grandmas eldest child, and there is no way it was adjusted within the timespan of 9 hours. 

At this point I felt like my grandma was endanger. I felt like they were trying to take advantage of the situation so I fought nail and tooth to find a proper placement for my grandma even if it was temporary. 
Long story short after many threats of legal action I found myself getting the call that my Mother had kicked out my grandma and her 5 dogs. She had 2 days in a hotel in Texas and that I had to go get her by a certain time because my Aunt T wasnt extending her stay (I cant remember if it was morning or night).  
With the help of my fiancé’s parents we rushes to texas driving a 15hour drive straight from kentucky. 

I wanted my Grandma to have a safe place to get her mind straight and figure out what she was going to do. 

During this drive I got many threatening messages from my Mother. Worst part is my Grandma was stressing me out texting me to hurry getting upset when we had to stop to at least eat (even though it was once) and then pressuring me and calling me.

When we got there it became apparent that something was really wrong with my grandma. Either way we brought her back to the house and I even made accommodations during the night before that drive there so she would have a room on the first floor near the kitchen and bathroom. She wouldnt have to climb stairs and me and my fiance was even willing to live in the basement with a mattress on the floor. Since this was only temporary. 

Things began taking a serious turn for the worst. 5 dogs plus the dogs we had turned to 11, and she didnt want to leave her room for ANYTHING. She got to the bedroom door and turned right back around yelling at me to come upstairs for every little thing. The problem is she was capable of doing this on her own but when she seen that I was awake she screamed for me.
Everyone was getting fed up with it and it wouldn’t be bad if she would of let us at least let her dogs out without her screaming at the top of the lungs. 

To make things worse they were getting fed up with how she treated me. She would complain, yell, or tell me to shut up or hurry. 

I gave her 3 simple rules, no dogs on the bed, make sure your dogs go out, and don’t smoke near the oxygen tank especially with it on. 

I made things easier, even when she argued with me. I let her dogs out, tried to keep her dogs off the bed which she constantly yelled at me for to the point where I gave up. It was a $1200 bed from the store and I really didn’t want it ruined by untrained dogs that she needed in her room 24/7 as a support group. 

I started suggesting that I dont think I was fit and that this wouldnt work out. I told her I realized that I couldnt help her in the way she needs, and it was unfair of her to allow her to stay under the impression that everything was fine. She asked me why and I told her she constantly yells for me she wont do anything herself and that she was rude to everyone here. Example, she said that everything would be fine once my step dad left. He got so upset and offended he left for trucking early which is insane because he was the one who pushed the idea to drive to texas to help her. 

She said she would do better and she was sorry. We somehow came to an agreement. She said she needed a walker and she would get around better so I got her a walker to borrow and the same day I brought it home she asked me to go get her a bunch of things (make her a sand-which, coffee, and even help her to the bathroom). I had been getting up at 8am everyday since she been here doing everything for her. I really just wanted her to do stuff herself. 

So i told her no that she has a walker and she can do it. If she needs help with other stuff sometimes I would be happy but she needs to do it herself. 

I started raising my voice a bit more after this because it felt like my own feelings was being ran over. I was already mildly frustrated with all the dogs in the house and having to completely take responsibility plus I couldn’t even breathe without hearing my name being yelled at every 5m. Every time I went in there it felt like I was having an anxiety attack. I wasn’t the only one…

To make things worse when I explained to her how upset everyone was over the step dad statement which everyone heard she tried to change the story saying she didn’t mean it that way but she did. 

Then she said that they were the ones who were having an issue and they didn’t want me here, which isn’t. I told her this was my own choice and that I really don’t think w working out. 

She gets pissed and I walk away because I don’t know exactly how to argue with an elderly lady. My voice was already rising and I was losing my patience. I didn’t want to start fighting and she just left a terrible situation but at the same time she wasn’t respecting my family, the rules, or even me. 

I had just gone through not knowing anything to worrying about her being in an unsafe situation to my grandma being homeless almost. Now my grandma was somewhere safe but she was starting a lot of issues. 

We all went to bed, woke up and it was a new day. After the argument I noticed my grandma was walking around with her walker more which I was proud of. Not only because of the break it gives me on some things but because of something else. I knew my grandma wanted to get back on her feet and in order to do that she can’t just depend on someone for everything. Plus if she cant take care of herself how is she going to take care of her dogs?

Me and my fiance ended up going to the store. My grandma didnt have any clothes so we decided to grab clothes. We originally only wanted clothes. 
My grandma found out and called us into the room. The vibe was already killed when we got into the room. 

She told us she wanted 2 packs of cigarettes from this certain store she called. She also wanted FUZZY socks to keep her warm and only FUZZY socks, she wanted underwear, joggers, and shoes. 

She said she wanted to pay and I told her no that she needed to save for her moving. 
We left and came back. My fiance had gotten the wrong sized underwear, I didn’t get her the fuzzy socks because the store didnt have the fuzzy socks but I got her really soft socks. I even got her bones for her dogs, joggers, and a few slides. 
She took 1 pair of underwear from the pile, a few pairs of joggers and told me to take the rest back. She didnt want the socks because they wasnt fuzzy, she didnt want the underwear because they were too big. And the joggers she didnt like and she didn’t like the way the slides felt. 

I told her in order to return the underwear I need all of the underwear. I said she needed the joggers for now because of how cold it is and I couldn’t keep giving her all my clothes. I told her she needs the slides because I need mine back. She then told me to take the bones back because her dogs doesn’t eat those types of bones. 

This pissed off my fiancé and he took everything back but what I got her to keep and got a refund. I told her since I know the people who work there and to not have to deal with any further issue like this she needs to go with us to the store to pick out what she wants. This seemed to piss her off even more. 

Somehow, things worsened until I finally had enough. I told her that I had to work in the morning and I get up really early to go to work and she needs to go to bed. Plus my step mom is in the room next to her and she wakes up even EARLIER. I mean go to bed at 8pm because you wake up at 2:30am to get ready and be at work at 3:30am. She needed her sleep. 

I told her that I am going to bed and turning my phone off. The dogs at this point was negotiated that 2 dogs at a time stay with her and the rest with us so we can potty train them. I even had an agreement with my other Aunt Heather to take my Grandma and she could sit her up with a small place. At this point my grandma had been as rude as ever to me so it was important that the agreement between my aunt heather and I over my grandma stand because I knew I was getting overwhelmed by it all and this was beyond my depths. Not to mention her rudeness was really putting me in a spot because she was insulting everyone. She made it quite apparently clear she didn’t want to be in my step mom’s home, that she didn’t like anyone and she didn’t like leaving her room. She had this thing in her head that I was going to harm her dogs or send her to a nursing home. Which I had no intention of doing and i don’t even think I could because she was deemed coherent. But then again I never looked into it because I had no interest. The only interest I have is honoring her wishes and giving her a peaceful place where shes with her dogs and never had to worry. I figured anyone who is elderly would want that. And I had it set up. 

Anyways when I told her that and went downstairs she decided to call the ambulance because she couldn’t breathe. 
I went upstairs because she yelled and she told me. I don’t know if I was at my breaking point because that day i had been up and down the stairs 150 times again over every little thing, or the fact that she was incredibly rude not to mention that she had her brand new oxygen tank on and was smoking with a dog who had just pissed in the bed to tell me that the entire fire department and ambulance was going to show up at around 12:30pm-1:00am. 

I told her fine but shes going with them and staying. They will be able to help her in ways I cant until my Aunt Heather picks her up, I told her I would keep her dogs (because without her I can actually make them go outside and stay till they potty and train them). 

Immediately she said she was fine and she didn’t want to. I told her no you’re going because you are not going to drag an entire department to my step mom’s house over a fluke. I told her I can’t anymore and she needs to go. I told the ambulance lady that if they didn’t take her I would be calling next because I was going to have a full on breakdown. 
She went there, I kept her dogs and somehow she had destroyed any possible living situation with heather. 

When she told me she wasn’t going to heathers I quickly contacted heather and put 2 and 2 together. Heather told her she couldn’t take all her dogs with her and that the place she was buying she couldn’t get. 
So because she couldn’t go there she wanted to go back to Florida and I guess ‘squat’ on the house she has. I found out that the home in Florida is likely going to be foreclosed on. 

I got in contact with her about her dogs. At this point, too many dogs is still too many dogs and they were kinda driving everyone crazy. I mean some was having issues with each other, my dogs were stressed and confused, and this was just insane. 

I later find out my Uncle Nick was coming to get her and the dogs. I asked her when and she said Monday. Monday rolls around and I get a message from Nick. He wanted me to keep the dogs and I said no hes taking them. I talked to my Grandma with him there (which I wasnt comfortable with because he is the one who was charged for battery by strangulation against me and why I was at my Mothers). I get upset because 1. i dont want anything to do with him and 2. Why even put me in a situation where Im even having to talk or work with him at all? I dont want this man at my step moms house. Let alone even having my number. So i block him and try and communicate with my grandma only about it. 

I asked her ‘cant he just take the dogs and drive down there and then come back for you?’ Because he had borrowed a car, came up to Kentucky unable to get my Grandma because of the oxygen dependency and was perfectly capable. 
Long story short, he told me and my grandma that his dog was aggressive and would kill her dogs. He also said he was in a hotel and was going to be late for work. 
During this time he was texting me saying that since I had a good life and my own place I can take care of my grandma and ‘thank you’. 

I was pissed. First off, I don’t have my own house and second I am just starting out my life. Anyways I found out that he was lying to my grandma. He lives with his girlfriend not his boss and his boss has the aggressive dog not him. He could’ve took the dogs back with him. Not to mention that he tried threatening the nurses at the hospital and trying to take $500 off my grandmas bank account( which is insane because her new card wasn’t activated yet and she hadn’t been paid) . I later found messages when helping my grandma with her phone why visiting her at the hospital of him asking her to ask me to help with rental cars since I had ‘a good job’.  

This made me feel like shit. Not to mention that I was already doing everything I could to keep her dogs from being put in a pound because they kept changing the date and the owner of the house didn’t want them there. 

I kept telling them to get the dogs it’s only a 5 hour drive, and he kept playing games and talking crap. So when they wanted to change the date again I just gave the phone to my step mom and fiance and they told them they had until tomorrow at 5pm to get the dogs. Now they are saying that I was mean to my grandma and cruel. 
Part of me feelings this way because I kind of put her in a hospital and I know I lost my temper sometimes and raised my voice. Plus shes in a tight position but then another part of me is pissed because of how rude, and I feel like my feelings don’t matter. Plus I feel like their all playing games with me and I am so confused. I keep asking for advice and everyone’s telling me that they understand but i cant tell if I am a shitty granddaughter or not.

Whenever I use my Coffee Maker Keurig near the Kitchen Sink. It keeps tripping my 20 amp AFCI circuit breaker. I moved it to the Kitchen Island that also has the same 20 amp AFCI circuit breaker, works perfectly.

1. I swapped the AFCI circuit breaker Kitchen island to Kitchen Sink. Kitchen Island still works perfectly but Kitchen Sink still doesn't work. All 5 outlets for that circuit (Kitchen Sink) all trip.
2. For the Kitchen Sink. It only trips when I use something that requires a lot of energy like Air Fryer or Coffee Machine. I've plugged in multiple low energy kitchen appliances like rice cooker, toaster, and water boiler near the sink. Worked fine and never tripped last 2 months.
3. Kitchen Sink only trips when it uses something that requires a lot of energy like an Air Fryer or Coffee Machine.
4. If there's a screw, loose, or damaged wire behind the dry wall or a bad outlet. Why do my low energy kitchen appliances not trip the AFCI circuit breaker and only trips when I use the Air Fryer or Coffee Machine?

I don't think it's an overloading problem, circuit breaker problem, or GFCI outlet problem. I have no idea what's the problem and how to fix this.

I just talked to an electrician. He said it's impossible to know what's wrong unless we go behind the dry wall which can be super expensive. The cheapest option is to just use a standard 20amp breaker and not an AFCI breaker which keeps tripping it. I asked many times, is it possible there's a drywall screw through a wire. He said he doesn't know. I asked if there's a screw through a wire. Is it possible for my home will catch on fire. He said it's pretty much impossible to start a fire. California is super regulated and safe especially new builds. If your regular circuit breaker 20amp trips while using your coffee machine. THEN you should be really concerned.

It started with feeling bummed out for a couple weeks and one Saturday morning had a full blown panic attack with my coffee with a lingering sense of intense unease that wouldnt let up for the past two months. I still havent completely accepted that it’s just anxiety and depression. All the psychosomatic symptoms that come with it all feel so intense and unique to me. It’s been hard not to feel alone, especially when I don’t have an obvious explanation. Over the past two months its been impossible to relax, Ive been exhausted, overwhelmed to say the least and experienced this weird, brain foggy, surreal haziness that makes me feel like Im in a different world or that Im disconnected (derealization I think).. I’ve felt hopeless trying to understand it. I’ve felt broken and stuck. Ive worked myself up thinking that I have a brain tumor or undiagnosed disease causing my feelings and sensations even though my doctor cleared me. Slowly Ive started to untangle my mess.. somehow. I dont know if its just the magic of time, therapy, my prozac, my supplements, consistently trying to exercise through it all.. Ive had to force myself to accept reassurance from others and trust in them when I feel alone and I believe nobody understands my experience.

The DOGE Department’s Divine Economic Reforms","The newly christened DOGE Department - Department of God's Economy — is here to make fiscal responsibility not just a virtue but a commandment. By divine decree (or executive order, which is practically the same thing), we shall overhaul these bleeding-heart policies on debt relief, immigrants, the poor, and prisoners. The Bible itself demands it - or at least the Bible as interpreted through the lens of sound economic policy, free-market capitalism, and a deep reverence for hedge fund managers.

https://preview.redd.it/65ff8nuxqpae1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26815e49a2a5e876b7bc01e932b5e669fbd016bb

**Debt Relief: The Jubilee Reimagined**

The Bible’s “Year of Jubilee” (Leviticus 25) is clearly a mistranslation. Some overly idealistic scribes must have misheard when God said, “Cancel the poor,” interpreting it as, “Cancel their debts.” The DOGE Department proposes a modern corrective: Instead of forgiving debts, let’s double them! After all, Proverbs 22:7 states, *“The borrower is slave to the lender,”* and we cannot deny our hardworking creditors the satisfaction of owning a fleet of metaphoric slaves.

As for those who cannot pay, let them enter into voluntary servitude internships for no less than seven years. It's biblical —and more importantly, cost-effective!

**Immigration: Crossing Borders and the Line**

It is well-documented in the Gospel of Manifest Destiny that Jesus hated immigrants. Why else would He have fled to Egypt as a child? To make a point, clearly. He famously said in Exodus 22:21, *“Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, unless it is politically expedient.”*

To honor this sacred text, the DOGE Department will expedite the detainment of migrants in family-friendly facilities equipped with robust earning opportunities. These state-of-the-art ""patriotic processing centers"" will offer detainees the chance to contribute to the economy via $0.15/hour manufacturing jobs, thus fulfilling the command in Matthew 25:35: *“I was a stranger, and you profitably detained me.”*

**The Poor: Blessed Are the Rich**

Contrary to the leftist propaganda found in passages like Matthew 19:21 (*“Sell your possessions and give to the poor”* \- obviously a typo), Jesus was adamantly pro-wealth. In fact, the Sermon on the Mount was, as any historian worth their salt will confirm, a *financial planning seminar.* His true message? Tax cuts for billionaires and privatized charity only.

To ensure compliance, the DOGE Department will replace food stamps with ""Faith Vouchers,"" redeemable only at corporate megachurch cafes. Bread of life? $4.99. Fish? Market price.

**Prisoners: In Chains, In Christ**

The Bible is unambiguous about prisoners: They are a crucial pillar of the economy. Isaiah 61:1 may claim something about *“setting the captives free,”* but a more literal, market-friendly reading reveals that captives were clearly freed to work in the fields for free.

The DOGE Department’s Prisons for Prosperity initiative will triple prison labor contracts, expanding into high-growth industries like luxury dog beds and artisanal coffee packaging. Corporations will thrive, the economy will flourish, and as Jesus himself said in Luke 4:18: *“I have come to preach good news to the corporations and profits to the stockholders.”*

**Closing Thoughts**

Who are we to argue with the Greatest American Who Ever Lived, Jesus Christ Himself, a white man born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, circa 33 AD? He personally wrote every book of the Bible in English, with a quill made of bald eagle feathers, so let us honor His vision: a nation where debtors are jailed, immigrants are exploited, the poor are punished, and prisoners are productively enslaved.

Let us pray - preferably with tax-deductible donations. Amen.

It kind of caught me off guard because he is someone who is direct but not always talking about things like that. It is very clear we are friends only as both not seeking relationships. But we hang out a bit talk movies or get a coffee etc. 

We chat more deeply sometimes but ever since I got given the card I have tried to bring it up, to tell him that it meant a lot and he smiles but then kind of clams up. So kind of feel like the topic is off limits to talk about.

I hope this doesn't come across as insensitive, but I just want to know how to respond better to my current boyfriend. He has some traits that I think might be autistic (although maybe he's just avoidant; I'm not sure!). I really care about him, and I think he really cares about me, and so I just want to understand him more. I really appreciate any insight anyone might have! 

Some of his traits include: being super rigid in his schedule, being insensitive when I don't understand something that seems obvious to him, not being very physically or emotionally affectionate, remembering minute details of the location of places we have been and being annoyed when I don't remember how to find them again, being inflexible in his personal morals (such as not wasting any food, and being annoyed that I don't finish all of my food but finishing it for me), and -- again, not sure if this is an autistic trait or something else -- taking it very seriously whenever I hang out with other people because to him it's a big deal to ever make time for anyone. This last one is hard for me to explain because I don't fully understand it, and so if other people can relate, that would be useful. I have tried to get clarification, but he also gets annoyed when I ask him to repeat something he has told me once, even if I don't understand because to him it's very obvious. 

  
But here's the longer version: 

We've only been dating for four months, but it seems like he really likes me, although some of his traits are confusing to me. For instance, he's told me that he won't spend time with me or stick around unless he's really interested, but that he won't tell me how he feels. He also said he's not big on physical touch, and that in the future he would prefer to have separate beds or at least a California king (although our sexual chemistry is very good; he also started sleeping over after about three weeks of dating, which he said is very rare for him). He's said other people he's dated have told him that wanting separate beds is a red flag, but I said I can understand it, and I think that gave him some comfort. Early on he did tell me he really liked me and even one weekend he told me he missed me, and he told me later it really was difficult for him to tell me how much he likes me, but that he wanted to say it because he was afraid I would leave if he didn't. He also held my hand regularly from the start, and a couple months in told me that was a new thing for him too. (For reference, he also has had two prior long-term relationships: one that started in high school and then was sort of rekindled, totaling 4ish years, and then another that lasted two years. I think both prior partners broke up with him.) 

A key source of conflict between us so far has been me hanging out with other people. For reference, we work for the same organization, although in different cities. Sometimes I have been hanging out with my coworkers casually, and they also know him. He's been pretty insistent to not mix our relationship with work, and said that even dating me was something he wouldn't usually consider doing, since we are technically colleagues (but again, in different offices). Still, he told me dating me is worth it for him though, because we have the same long-term life goals that have been hard to find for both of us. 

Anyway, he seems insecure when I connect quickly with other people or want to hang out with people casually. He has lifelong friends that he is dedicated to, and so do I, but where I am living now is new for me, and I'm trying to develop friendships to have some community here. His best friends came to visit him (we are both living far from home), and I met all of them. He also has had two other college friends come visit who I also have met. But when I ask him to hang out with my new casual friends, he says he doesn't want to because they don't seem like they'll be lifelong for me. 

We often have conflict about communication because he will think things are obvious when I don't think they are. He also teases me a lot about things, and repeats things over and over that to me seem like insults, but he said it's a way to show affection or flirt with me. However, it seems like maybe teasing people about certain traits is something him and his friends do, although I think even his friends have gotten annoyed with him; for example, he said one time at a friendsgiving, his best friend told him to bring a salad but he said he didn't think he'd need to, since there was already so much food, but then he brought it anyway and no one ate it. He said that he got kind of drunk and his friends told him he kept bringing it up the whole night, and that they told him it was really annoying. I realized that maybe this is just an annoying trait of his, but that he won't be able to let something go if someone tells him something and then it is contradicted. 

We actually are planning to go on a two week international trip together soon, and we first starting talking about traveling together pretty early on--maybe a month in after we started dating. This seemed kind of strange to me; it seemed like a big deal to go on such an elaborate trip so soon, and felt like a big milestone to me. He booked his tickets but I held off because the trip was still a couple months away, and we had basically just started dating. Eventually told him I needed to talk about it being kind of a big deal directly, and I asked him what would happen if we broke up. He told me that either way he would have a good time, and that he would be happy to go on a trip with me, even if we didn't end up together long term. 

So anyway, sorry this is so long, but I often find myself confused. He tells me that he is a pretty chill guy who just likes to go to the gym, go to coffee shops, and watch anime. I do all of those things with him, and I enjoy doing so. We go on long walks and have very deep conversations; we've both talked about things with each other that neither of us have talked to anyone else about, like having children and how we would want to raise our children. We've both told each other secrets we've only told our best friends. 

I also like doing other things he has said he doesn't like to do, like going to museums and seeing movies, but I don't invite him to do those things with me. But recently he has expressed that he feels frustrated that I don't suggest things for us to do together, because when he asks me what I want to do, he's genuinely asking, and he wants to do other things together, but he just doesn't know what to do, or what I would want to do.

Anyway, I really like him, and I would honestly be devastated if we broke up. I'm afraid we might be nearing that point, and I know it would be okay, but our life goals are so aligned, it seems such a shame we couldn't make it work. Any thoughts or advice? Maybe this is the wrong sub to put this in, but I truly appreciate any thoughts. Thank you! ",2,1735881391.0,AutismTranslated,2,1.0,False

It’s been almost a year and I talk to her as if we are friends but i feel like I’m pushing it and kind of faking because that’s what I want. I asked her about being friends again befor and she said yes but she may have changed her mind and to me doesn’t seem she is keen or wants to or she’s still upset?! Etc. 

She got upset we had our disagreement and she quit talking to me. There have been moments we reconnected for a bit but it’s never been the same. There have been glimpses of hope she wants to be friends again. She had asked for space but wow how much space/time does a person need? 

She has at least one other good friend now. Because of the timing it kind of hurts sometimes because it was around the time we stopped talking so I feel she replaced me. But that’s silly and unhelpful for me to think though I do sometimes feel jealous because they are close and she says she loves her. In a way it gives me hope she can or will love me as I know I am just as kind and just as loving and can be a good friend just like her if given a chance, and I have my own unique personality and benefit only I can provide. I feel a year is plenty of time and space to forgive me. I apologized and expressed how I feel and how much she and our friendship means to me. I’ve tried to see things from her perspective. I’ve given her compliments and in the past small gifts. I offered to treat her for her birthday when things were good. More recently I have brought up things people and pictures that helped us connect and remember the past. I have given her my contact info just in case and suggested we hang out or get together perhaps for coffee when she is ready. I’ve told her little life updates about my day and asked about hers. I’ve encouraged her professional life and done my best to stay out of her personal life though I haven’t been perfect as it Ms been an area of dissent. I’ve complimented her about her internal and external beauty. I’ve told her I will always be there for her and love her unconditional and that there is no pressure for when/if she wants to talk. 

All of this with little in return. At one point in the beginning she had blocked me so idk if I’m blocked now but she has responded since then so my guess is no. A year is a long time and while things may not ever be the same I thought we would be further along in our friendship by now. Maybe she’s not ready? Maybe she doesn’t want to be friends again after all and changed her mind. Should I ask her? Is a year too long to wait? ",0,1735881295.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,0.5,False

Well, yesterday, I opened it, fixed it and started. Voilà!!! It worked right away! Well, except that no water came from the coffee spout during the initial rinse and it did not coffee at all. I need help identifying the culprit and how resolve it. Here are some information:

1. The coffee grinds were dry!
2. The hose that comes out of brew group was cold.
3. When I opened and suck air out of the hose, it was blocked.
4. When I disassemble partially and suck air from the rubber part by itself, it was flowing fine.
5.  When I blow air from the part of the hose that connects to the spout, it was fine.

How do I fix this?",1,1735881170.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

She was her mom’s caretaker for twenty years. Her mom passed last November.

November 13, 2024 I hung out with my mom. We had a great day, if I remember correctly we got coffee and played a board game and talked about the future. On November 23 I called her, because we had plans to hang out. She was having hallucinations and believed the police were coming, she was hospitalized that night and the doctors couldn’t figure out what happened. She stayed there for a week until they found her placement in an assisted living facility. 

She’s been there since then, and her state has only worsened. She’s only had one episode since, it lasted 2 days, and one of the times I visited she couldn’t remember my name. She fell that night and busted her head open. That was December 24. The hospital called me around 11 that night asking me to pick her up, that’s how I found out she had fallen and had to get stitches. It’s hard for me to sleep soundly now.

I feel like in the span of a week I’ve gone through all the stages of grief at once. I’m 20, and majoring in neuropsychology, both factors have only made this process harder. 

Any chance I get to research disorders that could possibly match symptoms of dementia I throw myself into that possibility and do as much research into it as I can.

A piece of me knows that she has dementia but I refuse to accept it. I’ve seen what this disease can do to a person.

Today, I looked into grief counselors in my area and I’m going to start to go to one soon. 

Instead of counting down the time that my mom has left I’m going to try to look at the positive and cherish each moment. I know I cannot control my mom’s disease but I can choose to control the way I view it.

This whole ordeal has left me feeling empty and exhausted. I feel like a little kid who just wants their mama, I’m so sorry to anyone else who has had to deal with this horrible disease.",4,1735881080.0,dementia,5,1.0,False

She also had a brief but significant role in Sudden Impact (1983), where she played the waitress who dumped sugar into the coffee of Det.

I'm coming up ten years sober from drinking and drugs, except cannabis. Since beginning my diagnosis process, I've been upfront with my GP, therapist, and psychiatrist about my smoking habits. None of them care but have cautioned overdoing it and knowing when I need to slow down. 

Suffice it to say the last two years have been the hardest of my life. I had a mental breakdown this summer, which was partially (not at all fully) connected to me smoking too much weed. I was also leaving an abusive relationship, spiritual community, and state while juggling a PhD program, running a small business, and having a consulting gig. 

I started smoking more CDB-leaning cannabis, mostly sticking to 1:1s or 2:1s. If I don't, I am plunged into a panic attack. I try to only smoke in the evenings, or my days turn into spaghetti, and I'm just glued to being outside or online. 

One of my resolutions was to take a few months off from smoking. I've gone 2-3 weeks without smoking before and wanted to push myself. I've smoked only CBD for the past four days and feel so blah. I'm working out a ton and cooking at home, but I feel so empty while also full of energy. I've been going to bed at 4 am and waking up at 11.  I could walk for six miles and wouldn't feel much from that. 

The whole point of this post is I feel like I'm on a constant cycle where I'm hard on myself for smoking, but my body also doesn't respond well to meds. Cannabis is one of the few things that helps soothe my nervous system outside of exercising. I live in the NW, so it gets dark at four, and then I'm trapped inside with all my nothingness. I sometimes wonder if I'm being hard on myself about cannabis because of the social connotations connected to smoking. On the other hand, I don't like the feeling of being addicted to anything (but y'all know I love my coffee, lol).

Do you have any thoughts? Does any of this ring true to y'all? Also, I'm sorry if this is the wrong flair; I wasn't sure which one was most accurate. ",3,1735880216.0,AuDHDWomen,2,1.0,False

**Please READ everything. This blog will tell you how even a minutely smaller thing can create huge impacts.**

I don't usually write a lot on reddit. But I have been consuming this reddit content since a while now and have felt that I should contribute back to this reddit as a token of thanks.

**Summary:**

A month back I went to the doctor all trembling and in distress. I was mostly getting an anxiety attack or something. They measured my blood pressure and it was around 160/105. The doctor immediately said I should not be walking with this blood pressure. She immediately gave me Metropolol 50mg and some anxiety medicine. I said ""Do I really need to take meds?"". She totally asked me to take these meds.

Since a couple of years my blood pressure has been consistently higher. Sometimes around 145, sometimes 150. At doctor's office it is usually higher so I was never worried about doctor's office numbers. At home, these numbers are around 135-145. Sometimes I used to get heart palpitations and difficulty sleeping. My resting heart numbers were around 65, 75ish.

I was getting constant headaches and felt miserable most of the times. I don't know it was due to high BP or in general. It was at this time recently I made a decision that enough was enough and I need to take matters into my own hands and get these numbers down. I didn't know how but I wanted to.

**Something about my lifestyle:**

Since around 6 years, I workout around 5 days a week with both weight and cardio. I have very less overall and belly fat. Fat percentage is around 15-18%. Weight is in super control. Food is totally controlled. I don't eat a lot of junk but eat out sometimes. I have longer working hours though. I would consider myself fit without any other problems.

With these as the precursor, I should really not have high blood pressure at these high numbers. Although my mother has hypertension but still my numbers can't be this high.

**Current Status:**

**Suddenly since a couple of days, my blood pressure numbers are at 115/68, 116/70. My resting heart rate today is 55ish.**

I though of experimenting with my diet. The first thing that I did was to **stop coffee** totally. I have been drinking coffee since 4 years now. It's been 20 days I have stopped coffee completely. **And I started taking 1/2 cup of Beet Juice daily. But I just drank Beet Juice may be around 4-5 times. Then I stopped. So I don't think Beet Juice was doing anything. But can't discount the advantages of that juice.**

I have stopped coffee completely now and feel really at peace. The first few days were not great but I never craved for coffee. My life was more important to me than that bloody coffee. Now, I don't need coffee at all. I feel really amazing. My sleep is mind-blowing now. I mean totally mind-blowing. My resting heart rate has been amazing at 55ish. Sometimes between 55-60. Palpitations zero. Anxiety zero.

Bottomline: If I had taken the prescribed medications, I would have never found the reasons behind the problems. I took matters in my own hands and made changes.

My Advice:  
If you are not at distress, please don't take medicines directly. Doctors don't lose anything prescribing you medicines. Change your life. Experiment and then conclude. I am pretty pretty sure you'll see results.

I'm currently doing milk clarification and straining through a Toddy nylon filter in a round metal coarse mesh strainer. I need to make big batches of about 4 liters.

I make the mix, then pour into 25% whole milk, let it curdle for about a minute since I heard leaving it long to curdle isn't necessary, then pour the whole thing into the strainer with the nylon filter. The first 10-20seconds is cloudy then I start getting the clear stream out. I move the strainer to a different container and pour back the first cloudy liquid back in and let it filter over night.  
Up to here seems pretty standard according to all the info I've read around, but the problems is that sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't finish filtering and gets stuck. I have no idea what's different since I didn't change the recipe, but it just seems to struggle so much to filter out.

The biggest confusion I have is that I read a lot of people saying they filter once through a bigger micron nutmilk bag, then they filter it once more through a coffee filter. But isn't clarification done with the curds? So filtering it through a coffee filter for a second time with no curds doesn't do anything does it? I tried it and it just went through and nothing happened. Am I missing something?

1hsehlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoic/comments/1hsehlv/8_reasons_why_some_people_might_dislike_you/,8 Reasons Why Some People Might Dislike You,"Have you ever wondered why some people seem to dislike you for no apparent reason? No matter how friendly or polite you are, there's always someone who meets you with a cold or distant attitude. This puzzling behavior is often rooted in human psychology—envy, insecurities, or misunderstandings. Understanding these reasons is key to navigating social dynamics. Let's see the 8 surprising reasons why someone might harbor negative feelings toward you.

**1. Envy and Jealousy**

These emotions often arise when someone perceives qualities, achievements, or successes in you that they lack. Instead of drawing inspiration, they may feel resentment, seeing your success as a reflection of their own shortcomings. This can have far-reaching effects on how people perceive and interact with you.

At my workplace, I observed a noticeable change in James' behavior after I was promoted to team lead. We used to be friendly and collaborative, but after the announcement, James started to avoid me in meetings and seemed reluctant to share his ideas during group discussions.

One day, I happened to overhear James talking to a colleague about how he felt the promotion should have gone to someone with more experience—pointedly, himself. It came to me that my success possibly ignited feelings of envy in him, since we had both worked hard on the same projects. Instead of taking my success as a sign of our group's efforts, he saw it as a mirror held to his own shortcomings.

This change in our dynamic affected not only our interactions but also the overall collaboration within the team. I decided to tackle the problem by inviting James for a coffee, where I could openly acknowledge his contributions to our projects. By expressing my appreciation toward his skills and exploring how we might be able to work well with each other in my new role, we began to reestablish trust and relieve the tension.

2. **Misunderstandings**

Minor miscommunications can sometimes spiral into substantial conflicts. A single misplaced word or an ill-considered tone may result in misunderstandings, leading others to perceive you unfavorably, regardless of your true intentions. Such instances can profoundly influence how individuals see you and engage with you.

Ruth and I were working on a marketing project when a misunderstanding got us tense with each other. One day, during a meeting, I suggested rewriting a part of her proposal, but my tone came out to sound dismissive. Feeling disrespected, Ruth started to avoid one-on-one conversations with me.

I noticed the change and talked to her privately to clear things up. I explained that I meant no disrespect and was focused on the client’s needs. Ruth admitted she misinterpreted my comment, and we both apologized. After that, we improved our communication and successfully completed the project together.

3. **Clashing Values and Beliefs**

Differences in core values—be it about lifestyle, work ethic, or personal decisions—can all create friction. Others tend to view your opposing positions as an affront to them, a challenge to the self. This can color their perceptions and behavior toward you dramatically. I often clashed at work with Adams because, in essence, we had different values, and I would always vouch for innovative ways of doing, while he preferred the comfort of tradition. The conflict intensified when, on a project, Adams began to openly criticize my proposal by perceiving it as a challenge to his expertise. I quickly involved him in a one-on-one conversation, where I listened to his perspective and suggested a compromise. Combining his traditional approaches with my fresh ideas resulted in a great solution, one that earned us mutual respect despite our differences.

4. **Gossip and Rumors**

False or exaggerated stories possess the power to warp your image in the eyes of others. Gossip travels swiftly, nurturing biases and sowing seeds of unwarranted resentment. Such consequences can profoundly influence the way people perceive and engage with you.

In my neighborhood, I noticed that some of my friends were acting strangely towards me during our weekly meetups. They all seemed less friendly, mostly avoiding direct interaction with me. Curious and worried, I pulled up to my friend Sarah and asked if there was something wrong. After some hesitation, she finally blurted out that a rumor had started going around—that I had said something bad about one of my other friends, Lisa.

I was shocked because it wasn't true. I value my friendships and wouldn't say anything to hurt anyone. I realized the rumor might have started because Lisa and I had a small disagreement at a previous gathering, which someone probably blew out of proportion.

Rather than letting the misunderstanding brew, I invited Lisa to coffee and shared with her what I had overheard. I reassured her that there was no truth to the rumor and apologized if our disagreement had, in any way, contributed to the false impression. Lisa appreciated my candor and admitted that she had started to believe the rumor but felt relieved to have been told the truth.

By confronting the situation head-on, I managed to vindicate myself and fortify my bond with Lisa. The rumors gradually dissipated, and our circle became tighter as a result of our candid conversations.

5. **Personal Insecurities**

People who are insecure about themselves will often project their inadequacies onto others. Your strengths may remind them of their perceived weaknesses, triggering hostility. In these ways, this can considerably impact others' perceptions and behavior toward you.

In my sports club, I couldn't help but notice that Mark, a fellow member, often appeared irritated whenever I excelled during our games. Initially, I assumed it was merely a sign of competitiveness; however, as time went on, his remarks grew increasingly personal. He would utter phrases such as, “It must be nice to always have things come so easily,” or, “Not everyone has your advantages.”

I didn’t understand why he was acting this way, especially since I’d always tried to encourage and support everyone on the team. Later, another teammate mentioned that Mark had been struggling with his performance and felt like he wasn’t as skilled as the rest of us. My successes might have unintentionally highlighted his insecurities.

To tackle the situation, I started involving Mark more in practice, seeking his input and encouraging him in games. I made it a point to acknowledge his strengths, such as his strategic thinking, which proved to be a significant asset for our team.

As time went by, Mark's attitude mellowed, and he began to open up about the issues he was having. We were able to reestablish a good relationship and develop greater camaraderie through this dedication to cooperation and support.

6. **Lack of Empathy**

When individuals fail to grasp your intentions or experiences, they may render an unjust judgment against you. Such a deficiency in understanding cultivates resentment rooted in assumptions instead of facts. Consequently, this can have profound effects on how others perceive and engage with you.

During my college years, my roommate Emily and I kept very different schedules. I juggled classes, a part-time job, and tons of extracurricular activities, while Emily spent most of her time studying at home. One evening, after a particularly long day at work, I left a few dishes in the sink before I finally went to bed, exhausted.

The following morning, Emily was evidently distressed. She offered me the cold shoulder and remarked, “It’s so inconsiderate how some people can’t even clean up after themselves.” I felt a pang of hurt because she didn’t even inquire why I hadn’t tidied up. She presumed I was merely being lazy, but in truth, I was utterly exhausted and had intended to clean everything in the morning.

So, initially I felt a lot of urge to retaliate and justify myself, but it soon came to my understanding that this could very well be some kind of misunderstanding. So, I sat down with Emily, shared my situation: juggling work and studies and how sometimes I simply needed a little more time to stay on top of my chores.

Emily was taken aback; she hadn't thought about how busy I was. She apologized for jumping to conclusions, and we talked about how we could communicate better moving forward. We agreed to be more understanding of each other's struggles and even set up a simple system to keep the apartment tidy without adding stress.

From that moment forward, our relationship improved significantly as we dedicated ourselves to comprehending each other’s experiences. This situation revealed to me that a lack of empathy frequently arises from misguided assumptions. When we strive to view things through another’s eyes, it can utterly transform the dynamic and fortify our connections.

**7. Competition and Rivalry**

Excessive competition can make admiration turn to hostility. Some people can view your success as a threat, not as an opportunity to grow together. And this can have really far-reaching effects on how people perceive and interact with you.

In high school, I was on the track team with my buddy Jake. We both loved to run and would practice together quite often. It was great in the beginning because we motivated each other to get better and celebrated wins as a team. Everything changed, though, when I broke the school record for the 100-meter dash.

Suddenly, Jake seemed to pull away. He ceased joining me for practice and began to make passive-aggressive remarks such as, “Well, not everyone gets lucky on race day.” Confusion and hurt welled up inside me, for I believed we were teammates, not rivals.

It got worse when we were paired for a relay race. Instead of planning strategy, Jake hardly said a word to me and seemed more interested in showing off that he was the superior runner. His attitude made the whole experience stressful, and our team performance suffered because we weren't working together.

One day, I resolved to speak with Jake. I expressed to him the depth of my appreciation for his friendship and how his rivalry was influencing both of us. He confessed that he felt eclipsed by my success and feared he might never be able to measure up. I comforted him by saying that his dedication and talent motivated me, emphasizing that together, we were far more formidable.

That conversation changed everything. We commenced training together once more, and instead of trying to outdo one another, we worked to bring each other up, challenging each other to be our best selves. In our next meet, we both achieved new personal bests, helping our team win.

**8. Defying Social Expectations**

Choosing a path that goes against societal norms can make others uncomfortable. Your independence challenges their beliefs, leading to feelings of resentment. Understanding these factors can help you approach relationships with compassion and resilience. Remember, much of the negativity directed at you reflects others’ struggles rather than your actions. Focus on fostering positive connections and staying true to yourself. This can have far-reaching effects on how people perceive and interact with you.

We've got a baby coming soon, relatives coming soon, we've made some big financial moves to pay off all our debt within a few years, but, well. What if something happens?  I'm not working right now, and won't be until next winter, so our income is cut significantly. It's not unreasonable to think I should test things now, and stuff some money under the mattress! NGL, if I can help it, I also do not want to contribute to the economy for a few years.

There are three prongs to the prep, but i figured I could report here on the first one to keep us accountable: eat from the property, forage, barter, cannery, and deep pantry to cut grocery bills. My normal deep pantry, cannery, and garden is pretty sad this year, because major life events. Still, I think I can easily eke out a month or four on a $25/week grocery budget, including feeding guests. Especially if I focus on cooking with legumes!  I plan on taking the difference between the prep budget and our average food spend, and setting it aside. $25 is clipped to the fridge. SO and I can use it at any time, or roll it over to next week.

We soft-started the 1st, planning to do a full start tomorrow, January 3. I tested a 1/2 batch dry mix no knead baguette recipe that fits in a 1L glass jar (think reused Rao's Marinara jar or similar) by having my SO mix it with the indicated amount of water last night. They are not a baker. It proofed overnight, then I baked it this morning, and served it with butter, and pineapple jam I made this spring from the dirt cheap pineapples I picked up on sale post Easter holiday.  I thought we'd eat half, but nope. 1/4 stick of butter, the whole loaf, and 1/2 cup of pineapple jam. SO drank his drip coffee, I drank my half-caff single shot latte he makes me every morning.

Lunch was hot dogs. Beef franks could be a food group for SO, and we have so many house projects. He drank a veggie green drink for some pretense at nutrition, and ate from his Xmas candy stash. I peeled the zest from two scrubbed and rinsed navel oranges, then peeled the pith and ate the oranges. The zest gets sugared and stored, or dehydrated and stored, bc orange zest is amazing in tons of recipes, including my preferred cowboy candy canning recipe. The pith is composted.

I baked the second half of the no knead baguette dough, intending it for monte cristos for tomorrow's lunch, and the base to serve white bean brandade for dinner tomorrow, but..nope. SO and I ate it while it was still hot from the oven, finishing off the pineapple jam, more butter, and more of our apple butter SO made a few weeks back. Fresh bread is dangerous. Wtf. Not a lick of protein.  I doubled down on the nutritionless mayhem by drinking the last of the (pasteurized) egg nog mixed 50/50 with milk. The only way to survive the iron pills I'm on for pregnancy-related anemia, tbh. Those horse pills are nauseating.

That's ok. I cooked up about three pounds of shredded chicken from stockpiled chicken breasts in the chest freezer. The other 3# was trimmed and fit into (2) deli trays, labeled, and put back in the chest freezer. The shredded chicken is divided between freezing in portions for later use, and creamy poblano chicken enchiladas for fresh eating tomorrow and freezer meals for newborn hell time.

He didn’t do that to anyone else’s wife.  He asks about me only and not about my husband, very obvious things that would make someone think you’re into them.

I get a thrill out of thinking this guy is into me. I don’t know what it is but it’s a turn on to me to think there’s another guy out there who is attracted to me.  

I find myself daydreaming about this man from husbands work and making up scenarios involving him. 

There is absolutely no chance in hell I would ever do ANYTHING to compromise my marriage.

Does my guilty conscience make me a bad wife?  Why am I fantasizing about another man? What does this even mean?

tl;dr
I get a thrill out of my husbands coworker being into me. ",0,1735878471.0,marriageadvice,4,0.33,False

1hsdyyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hsdyyo/new_machine_needed_help_budget_3k_max/,New Machine Needed - Help! [Budget $3k max],"I currently have a Breville Duo Temp that I purchased about 19 years ago. It’s so old that it’s almost impossible to find on the Breville website 😂 

I’ve been using it every day and having pretty poor outcomes with it. I’m forced to use the original portafilter and pressurized dual shot basket because Breville slightly changed the size and the new Breville 54mm size is not the same. I have the basket for the ESE pods - but when I tried to use it the pod choked the machine 🤦‍♀️ 

After reading a lot of posts I went and purchased the Bambino Plus a few hours ago. I hate it. Having to hold onto it to attach the portafilter makes me realize how easy this thing is going to break. It also does some sort of sneeze when it’s done with the shot. 😑 the auto milk also seems dumb. I thought I’d love it but it didn’t turn off - maybe it’s not supposed to - but I thought the machine is supposed to sense it and turn off when it got to the right temp or froth I selected. 

One of the major coffee retailers is selling the new Rancilio Silvia Pro X and a Eureka Mignon Specialita grinder as a bundle that I’m considering. But going from Breville to a real machine has me worried I might fail.

I love milk drinks. I was also looking at just getting the Breville Oracle Jet (although now I know I won’t care about the auto milk feature).

I am a baby novice - never ever made this a hobby and I also don’t really want to. My goal is to buy something that isn’t terribly difficult to pull great shots (probably 4-5 double shots a day) and for me to be able to steam and froth my almond milk to make cappuccinos and lattes. 

I’m hoping that I can get some good recommendations from this community. I’m not set on any machine - other than - not the Bambino Plus.",1,1735878077.0,espresso,10,1.0,False

Basically I go to a local coffee shop that I have fell in love with since they first opened. Anyway, I was sitting in the back, writing my music and listening to some when a guy approached and asked me something. I had my headphones in so I took them out and asked him to repeat. He asked me to play a song for him. He knew exactly what song he wanted me to play and the tonality in his voice made it sound like it was something he needed to hear. Me having the warm heart I do, agreed. I turned off my Bluetooth and played the song. The song in question is ""The Feel Again (Stay)"" by Blue October. After the song was over, he thanked me, and left. The whole duration of the song, he just stared out the window. Didn't say anything weird. No weird looks. Just as simple as that. The meaning of the song he asked me to play is about the lead singer who's having Marriage problems. Makes me wonder, with the tone of voice he requested the song (and knowing exactly what song he wanted to hear), if this was something he could relate to at the time, or if it was simply just a song he enjoyed and wanted to hear. It makes me wonder if it means something for me that I'm just not understanding. Or if it's just as simple as a stranger who was in need of a help as simple as hearing a song. Either way it's made me shed a few tears thinking about it and I hope I see him again and maybe we can have a chat. Also find it odd that I sat there for about 10 more minutes before I packed up and left. Pulled out onto the road and slowed down cause there was a guy crossing the road and I noticed it happened to be him.

For the purpose of this question it could have been ""I'm telling you, Biden is America's greatest president!"" or ""I'm telling you, Trump is America's greatest president!"" It doesn't what was actually said. It was something that said out loud. And I felt differently than the other customer and I felt I had an equal right to express my opinion. I can see how the kind of comment could break the rules of civility. In this case, didn't say anything personal about her. I didn't even say she was wrong. Mostly, I asked why she felt the way she did, what examples she had to support and I pointed out inconsistencies in her statements. Eventually, she said ""I wasn't talking to you."" Yes, you are when you say something out loud in public. And it was fair for me to respond. Do you disagree or believe there are limits? Please let me know.

1hsdwwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hsdwwt/spent_way_too_much_time_in_research_in_review/,Spent way too much time in research / in review hell. Sharing what I learned,"I was debating for a while between the different superautos (Gaggia Accademia, KF7/8, Delonghis, etc). I was also debating whether to just get a semiautomatic instead. Currently I have an older philips machine. 

I know a lot of people get stuck in review purgatory, so figured I'd share top tips I learned along the way.. as well as what I went with and why

Tips:

1. **Hone in on the #1 thing you actually care about.**  For me it was espresso quality, I was sick of using my old Philips every day and getting watery mud. I wanted as close to parity with a super automatic as possible, and the ability to pull the strongest possible shot. Everything else was negotiable.
2. **Understand the top complaints people have.** I noticed lots of people complaining about milk temperature. I hadn't even thought about that, and knew that going with auto-frothing could be a deal breaker if the temp was horrible.
3. **Actually try out the machines in person**. Go to a Sur La table, crate & barrel, or william sonoma. They have these machines out there, dialed in, and you can try them out yourself to see what the fuss is about.
4. **Watch the right reviews**. It feels like there is so much marketing fluff in this space. Find reviews that do technical testing on the parameters you care about. For example if you care about milk temps, find channels that do probe testing. If you are about dosing, find ones that analyze every possible menu option to minmax dose. The best channels I found were Tom's Coffee Corner, Coffee Kev, and other sporadic ones.

I ultimately ended up getting a Magnifica Plus, for three reasons:

1. **Espresso dosing**. From what i've gathered in reviews, it can dose ~17g of coffee. This is about the dose you would actually use in an actual espresso machine. Tom's coffee corner released a review on it, and said it out performed higher tier delonghis. It also allows for adding in extra shots in drinks (i.e. no need to manually do it separately).

2. **Milk temperature**. Based on testing in youtube videos, the[ KF8's milk temp](https://youtu.be/z10NCtv7ERQ?si=RxcWHftfNAeXRA89&t=216) hovers around 55 celcius (131 f). The magnifica plus had multiple reviewers saying it can [hit high 60s (154 f)](https://youtu.be/NB7VsvrBzwI?si=w3kx4hNPbHH7Hoco&t=517).

3. **Assessing my #1 requirement**. After trying a few out in person I realized the espresso quality of SAs is ""good enough"" for me, when dosed correctly. Therefor decided it wasnt worth spending 2x on the oracle jet (just yet lol... who knows what will happen).",4,1735877893.0,superautomatic,7,1.0,False
