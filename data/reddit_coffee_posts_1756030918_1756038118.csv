1myu482,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1myu482/find_out_if_the_best_masticating_juicer_by_omega/,Find Out if the Best Masticating Juicer by Omega Is Worth It,"The Omega JC2022GY11 has been my companion for the past few weeks in my quest for healthier living, and let me tell you, it has certainly left an impression on my kitchen routine. As someone who‚Äôs been an on-and-off juicing enthusiast, I‚Äôve seen my share of juicers come and go‚Äîsome too noisy, others a nightmare to clean, and quite a few that simply didn‚Äôt extract enough juice. This one, however, feels like it‚Äôs among the cream of the crop.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was its sleek gray finish paired with its vertical design. At 18.07 inches tall, it‚Äôs a bit taller than most appliances on my counter but doesn‚Äôt feel bulky. It fits snugly next to my coffee machine without taking over the entire counter. That said, its 13.67-pound weight means it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd want to move around frequently‚Äîwhich is fine by me since it looks stylish enough to leave out. The build feels solid, and the quality is evident from the uncoated finish that promises durability over time.

**Ease of Use: No Prep Work Hero**  
What really stood out for me about this juicer is its mega batch hopper. The two-liter capacity is a dream for anyone who hates chopping fruits and veggies (like me). Tossing in whole apples or an unpeeled orange and watching it work its magic with minimal prep was like hitting the jackpot. This feature is especially nice if you‚Äôve got a busy household to keep up with or you‚Äôre preparing large batches of juice ahead of time.

**Highlights**  
- The generous two-liter hopper saves countless prep hours.  
- Its all-in-one auger simplifies setup and cleanup.  
- Capable of making not just juice but also nut milk and even ice cream.  

[View Omega JC2022GY11 sale info on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b0bwftmgdm/)  

**Juicing Performance**  
This 150-watt appliance is a slow masticating juicer, meaning it works at a quiet but deliberate pace to maximize nutrient extraction. It grinds fruits and veggies gently, ensuring you get cold-pressed juice with all those vitamins and minerals intact. I ran carrots, kale, apples, and even ginger through it‚Äîeverything came out vibrant, smooth, and tasting fresh. There‚Äôs also an auto-reversing feature that can detect if the auger is getting jammed (a lifesaver when juicing tougher ingredients like beets).

While it‚Äôs not the fastest juicer out there‚Äîslower speeds are the trade-off for nutrient preservation‚Äîit‚Äôs far from frustratingly sluggish. Its thoughtful timer stops operation after five minutes, so you won‚Äôt overwork the machine or yourself. The sweet spot for me? The machine remembers its last used operation thanks to a nifty 60-second memory feature. Toss in a few extra strawberries or celery stalks, and you can pick up where you left off. Cool, right?

**Favorable Attributes**  
- The slow speed protects enzymes, giving you nutrient-rich juices.  
- The auto-reversing feature prevents jams without constant supervision.  
- A memory function for adding ingredients without resetting the process.  

**Cleaning Convenience (Or the Lack of Pain)**  
Anyone who‚Äôs owned a juicer knows the horror of cleaning a million tiny parts, filters, and screens filled with pulp. This is where the Omega JC2022GY11 scores again: no juicing screens! The all-in-one auger makes cleaning this machine ridiculously easy. While it's not dishwasher-safe (hand-washing is recommended), cleanup takes no more than five minutes. A quick rinse of the detachable parts and you‚Äôre done.

That said, I did find that leftover pulp can get lodged in smaller areas and occasionally requires some light scrubbing. Not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning.

**Areas of Concern**  
- It isn‚Äôt dishwasher-safe, so manual cleaning is a must.  
- Its height might not fit under some low kitchen cabinets.  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve had the chance to use machines like the Breville Cold Plus and Hurom H-AA, both of which come with their own unique set of features. The Breville excels in speed but sacrifices juice quality due to its centrifugal design. Hurom, on the other hand, matches Omega in creating robust juices and sleek design elements but doesn‚Äôt come close in terms of ease of cleaning. The Omega JC2022GY11 feels like a sweet spot‚Äîit combines the juice quality of slow-masticating models and a user-focused design, freeing you from frustrating maintenance routines.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Even though it feels premium, it‚Äôs priced quite competitively compared to other top-tier slow juicers on the market. The extra-large hopper and versatility make it worth every penny, especially if regularly buying cold-pressed juices from stores has been draining your wallet. You‚Äôre essentially paying for a quiet, efficient, and easy-to-use appliance that doubles as a smoothie maker and ice cream churner too. That versatility alone is enough to justify the cost for me.

I wanted to share some news about my Anki blog.  
For a long time, I‚Äôve been getting a flood of messages  emails, DMs ‚Äì all asking the same questions:

How does Anki work?(Made a separate long blogpost for that, still)  
Is Anki free or paid?

How do I use Anki on iPhone/Android?

Why can‚Äôt I find the right app?

Which is the best deck for NEET PG/INICET?

Initially, I tried replying to every single one. But honestly, it‚Äôs become overwhelming. I realized that if I‚Äôm putting in so much time answering, updating, and helping, I need to make it sustainable for myself too.

So here‚Äôs the change: My blog is going private and will now be accessible only to subscribers at ‚Çπ99/month.

  
What subscribers will get:You can subscribe either by:

  
‚úÖ Complete updates to the Lazarus decks (I‚Äôve been working on these for a long time, and I update almost every other week with new edits, images, tables, mnemonics)

‚úÖAll the decks that i use regularly, their reviews gathered together at one place:one comprehensive place for Indian anki

‚úÖ All Indian decks organized in one place (plus my edits to make them more efficient)(I am currently doing panacea decks,adding explanations,images, intuitive breakdowns from chatgpt)

‚úÖ Tips and tricks for Anki (especially for med students who want to use it effectively)

‚úÖ Future question bank decks (I will start solving the Qbank decks form the next month and start modifying things,refining things,updating it, will update the regular decks on my blog)

‚úÖ Private Telegram channel access where these decks will be easily downloadable (my older will soon be private and tied to blog access), Sparrow,BAMS etc. notes lectures

‚úÖThe private telegram lecture will have a comprehensive private(hence immune to copyright) collection of RR notes, videos etc from wherever place i can find.

  
The deck will be free for my close friends, people who have contributed to the Lazarus project(just reach me out once for access) or anyone whose deck i have hosted on my blog until now(just reach me out)

I want to be clear:

I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúextract‚Äù money from anyone. I‚Äôve shared my work for free for a long time, but the reality is charity doesn‚Äôt pay bills. Right now, I‚Äôm saving up for a laptop so I can use Anki more effectively (currently only using my iPad,which doesnt support adons, anki with addons can do wonders).  I have made all my lazarus decks on my ipad using a keyboard and a mouse and tbh it sucks, and drains a lot of energy. 

Every deck is available right on this subreddit, I am just putting out my own decks and other decks in a more organised way, that would help everyone.

At ‚Çπ99/month (literally the cost of a coffee), I think it‚Äôs fair for the amount of time and energy I put into this and would help me sustain. thats even cheaper than the ankihub subscription.

1mytoy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRawData/comments/1mytoy7/should_you_buy_the_synology_ds223j_nas_for_home/,Should You Buy the Synology DS223j NAS for Home Storage Needs,"The Synology DS223j has occupied my desk for a good while now, and honestly, I've grown attached to it like one might grow attached to a good pair of noise-canceling headphones. Synology DS223j may be labeled as ‚Äúdiskless,‚Äù but don‚Äôt let that fool you‚Äîit‚Äôs anything but inferior. Compact, well-built, and equipped with Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), this little box provides a seamless, personal cloud storage experience. Much more than a glorified hard drive, it‚Äôs quietly become the backbone of my digital life.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that really caught my attention was the minimalistic and compact design of this NAS device. Its white finish fits right into my home office setup and doesn‚Äôt scream for attention like some tech can. At just 6.5 x 3.94 x 8.9 inches, its footprint is smaller than a hardcover dictionary. Weighing under two pounds, it‚Äôs easy enough to move around, though it‚Äôs been solid as a rock once placed. It doesn‚Äôt just look good; it whispers in my office, with minimal noise even under considerable workloads. Oh, and for those boiling summers when even my patience for tech warms out, the energy-efficient operation is a massive plus!  

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
Setting up the NAS felt surprisingly simple, even for someone like me who treats manuals like bedtime stories. Synology‚Äôs DiskStation Manager walks you through the setup like a helpful virtual assistant. Once I got it running, I noticed how responsive it was, even when multitasking through different features. File transfers zipped along, and streaming video directly stored on the device felt buttery smooth. I‚Äôve backed up massive folders without it even breaking a sweat. Need a private cloud? This thing handles it while sipping on negligible wattage‚Äîtalk about smart efficiency.  

[Check Synology DS223j price on Amazon.](https://pasprog.com/p/b0c8814gkb/)  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact design blends seamlessly with any decor.  
- Synology DiskStation Manager ensures an easy-to-navigate user experience.  
- Reliable performance during tasks like backups, sharing large files, and streaming.  
- Nearly silent operation alongside energy-efficient consumption.  

**Good Points**  
This device‚Äôs ability to serve as a secure private cloud particularly stood out. Offering 100% ownership of my data, I no longer have to blindly trust third-party cloud giants. All my precious vacation photos, important project documents, and random memes are shielded and easily accessible. Plus, the multi-platform access means I can grab a file from my smartphone, tablet, or laptop while lounging on the couch or sipping coffee in a caf√©. Convenience doesn‚Äôt get better than this.  

**Limitations**  
As good as the Synology DS223j is, expecting perfection would be unfair. For starters, it‚Äôs a diskless unit, meaning you‚Äôll need to purchase and install hard drives separately. While that gives flexibility to choose your own storage size, it also adds to the cost. Additionally, the device can occasionally be a bit overwhelming for absolute newcomers to NAS systems, especially if they‚Äôre venturing beyond basic setups. Learning the nuances of advanced features might take a little time for those who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy.  

- You‚Äôll need to buy your own hard drives, increasing overall expense.  
- Not entirely beginner-friendly for advanced features.  
- The initial setup for detailed configurations may feel longer than anticipated.  

**Alternative Products**  
Taking a look at competitors, the QNAP TS-233 caught my eye in the same price segment. It offers comparable features, though its interface isn‚Äôt as intuitive as Synology‚Äôs. The bigger player, though, might be the Western Digital My Cloud Home. Its automatic backups and sleek design make it an easier option for families wanting a plug-and-play device. However, it lacks the broad feature set and in-depth control that Synology‚Äôs DSM delivers, meaning it‚Äôs more suited for simpler needs. Synology edges out with its balance of power-user flexibility and straightforward setup for those exploring NAS systems.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
The question of whether the Synology DS223j justifies its price is an interesting one. For professional-level private cloud features and comprehensive, secure data protection, the cost balances itself out. Sure, you could argue that other storage options might be cheaper upfront, but this NAS feels like an investment rather than an expenditure. Over time, its energy-saving operation and low maintenance convince me that its value far exceeds its price tag.

1mytnes,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1mytnes/its_530_am_and_ive_been_awake_for_2_hours_already/,"It's 5:30 am, and I've been awake for 2 hours already because of a dream I had.","So we got back from camping yesterday evening. It was the last trip of the summer before kids start school, and we had a great time, relaxing by the fire, looking at stars, talking about space, and then the next morning we were digging for crystals at a public digging spot way up in the mountains. It is a yearly ritual in my family and our annual crystal harvest was a success.

On the way home on the interstate, driving about 80 mph, as I'm passing a truck, we get passed by a motorcyclist going at least 120 mph, and splitting lanes. He decided to drive between me and the truck. So I almost drove off the road trying to avoid him, as I thought he was going to smash into the back of my car and kill us, that's how fast he came up on us from behind... I cussed a little and we all calmed down and forgot about it for the rest of the drive.

I got home, and since I wake up at 5:30 am every day because of aches and pains now, I was dead tired after camping, and was in bed at 8:30 pm. I don't normally have dreams but I had such a vivid dream just now. In my dream, it was a continuation of the drive home, but it was some weird alternate reality, where the guy did end up hitting us from behind. I am not sure if he died, but in my dream, I died, and the rest of my family survived and carried on without me, and I got to see the future like I was in the movie Scrooged or something, moving from one place and time to the next.

I became a dad ghost, who stuck around and got see glimpses of my kids growing up without me. I could see my wife carrying on and sad as she was packing up what little belongings I do have (like 90% tools), into a moving truck. My oldest was there with her and both were crying. And my wife was saying to her, how, ""If I know your dad, he is here now with us."" and my daughter was like, ""yea it's almost like he's watching us."" My oldest seemed the most ok, but I could sense that she was holding back her emotions. Then my middle child was very hurt by the turn of events, and started acting up and disconnecting from her family, and no matter what, I could not be there for her through her troubling times. I could see her cry at night when she was alone, and it was heartbreaking. I just wanted to hold her and tell her I loved her... And my youngest girl could actually still communicate and ""feel"" me. At one point in my dream, she was on the floor playing with Barbies, and my ghost dad ass got right in her face and I tried to say ""I LOVE YOU!"" to her but nothing came out of course. She stopped what she was doing doing for a sec, and said, ""I love you too, but you're not here anymore."" I tried to express how sorry I was about that and how I wanted to be there, and she said ""It's ok."" In my dream, I just let out a silent moan, like I was in pain. I then woke up and could not go back to bed.

I don't know how to feel right now, but I did walk into my kid's rooms and check on them all and tuck their blankets over them. I can't have this happen to me, and I know this was just a dream, but I want to be around with them forever to make sure they are all ok until the day I do eventually pass away. Why do we have dreams like this? What purpose do they serve? I'm grateful for every second I spend with them, and for every moment we share. Why do I need to be reminded in such a way of all this? I am thankful to be able to work from home, and literally be with them since birth, and not missing a moment, including their concerts, graduations, and all their birthdays... I feel like this dream could have served some other dads out there who need a reminder to be there, not for me. It was too much, and I could feel a physical pain in me during this dream, like an aching sadness. Whyyyy?

Sorry for the rambling story, I just don't know what to do right now, except drink my coffee, listen to the morning breeze, and watch the sun come up, as my family is asleep, and be thankful I am still alive I guess??? I'm just waiting for them to wake up so I can hug them!",3,1756036617.0,daddit,1,1.0,False

CHAPTER FIVE

¬†They sat in the small conference room adjacent to Containment B, each with a different screen in front of them, the looping footage of Devoste‚Äôs transformation playing over and over in the background. The room had the stale hum of overfiltered circulation. Not cold, not warm, just sterile. The tension pulled emotions thin and surgically taut. No one had touched the coffee pot that had been brewed early that morning, back when they still believed in thresholds.

Langston glanced at the screen again before speaking. ‚ÄúWe designed MIMs to be immunological. A viral shield. That was the brief.‚Äù

Bates didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúAnd now we‚Äôre watching it rewire cognition.‚Äù

Wei, seated at the end of the table, tapped his pen against a notepad. ‚ÄúNot just cognition. Prioritization. Motivation. Emotional response.‚Äù

Langston closed her laptop with a sharp click. ‚ÄúNo. That wasn‚Äôt in the projections. We didn‚Äôt see this in any of the primate trials.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause we weren‚Äôt looking for it,‚Äù Wei said gently. ‚ÄúWe measured immune response, not ideological shift.‚Äù

Bates finally looked up, her voice flat. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a vaccine.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an instrument of behavioral shift,‚Äù Wei said. ‚ÄúA quiet lever.‚Äù

Langston stood, agitated. ‚ÄúThis changes everything. Ethics, trial standards, disclosure. We thought this was going to give people sniffles and immunity, not rewire their capacity for fear.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet,‚Äù Wei said, pointing to the data, ‚Äúhis cortisol is nearly flatlined. His serotonin‚Äôs up. His amygdala‚Äôs shrunk by more than half. He‚Äôs not just immune. He‚Äôs neurologically‚Ä¶ different.‚Äù

‚ÄúCalm,‚Äù Bates said softly. ‚ÄúPeaceful, even. But detached. Muted.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlive and functional,‚Äù Wei added. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not injured. Just‚Ä¶ tuned differently.‚Äù

Langston paced to the door, paused, turned back. ‚ÄúYou think this is a good thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a real thing,‚Äù Wei said. ‚ÄúAnd that means we have to understand it before we judge it.‚Äù

Langston‚Äôs mouth tightened. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about mass, involuntary neurobiological change,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt just study that. You get dragged before tribunals for it.‚Äù

Bates leaned forward, her brow furrowed. ‚ÄúPeaceful or not, we can‚Äôt assume everyone will come out like Devoste. What if some minds don‚Äôt land so softly?‚Äù

There was a long silence. The hum of the building‚Äôs filtration system seemed louder.

‚ÄúI thought we were stopping a pandemic,‚Äù Bates said. ‚ÄúNot starting a behavioral revolution.‚Äù

Langston returned to her seat, slowly. ‚ÄúThank God we didn't do mass human trials. This is a horror show.‚Äù

Wei met her eyes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think horror is the word.‚Äù He looked faintly amused.

Angry, Langston responded, ‚ÄúThen what the hell would you call it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOpportunity.‚Äù

Bates leaned back in her chair, her hands trembling slightly as she clasped them. ‚ÄúGod help us. We‚Äôve rewritten the terms of humanity without even realizing it.‚Äù

Wei continued, ""My preliminary findings show that not everyone will end up as basic as Devoste. I really believe that those with less fear-based brain structure will be much closer to our intended outcome.""

""Closer? How close?"" asked Bates.

""I can't be sure without more testing, and yes, human testing, but I think there would be very little change. Perhaps an innate peaceful disposition, a preference for simplicity. I can't be sure, but I believe the less rigid the subject's thinking is innately, the more they stay the same.""

Langston exhaled and rubbed her eyes. ‚ÄúSo what you're saying is that MIMs doesn‚Äôt overwrite the brain. It enhances what‚Äôs already dominant.‚Äù

Wei nodded. ‚ÄúExactly. And it intrigues me.‚Äù

Bates folded her arms tightly, more to still the tremor than out of protest. ‚ÄúIf this is true, we‚Äôve built something that selects. Not just protects.‚Äù

Wei looked again at the looping footage of Devoste, still sitting cross-legged on the lab floor, eyes half-closed, breathing like a monk. ‚ÄúWe need to see more outcomes before we panic.‚Äù

Langston didn‚Äôt respond. She stared at the screen as if trying to see through it. Just beneath her composed surface, irritation tugged at her jaw. She hated that Wei sounded so calm. So speculative. They had all agreed to this protocol based on its biological merits, not its philosophical implications. And now here they were watching humanity shift from the inside out.

And then the door to the conference room opened.



The hallway outside the conference room had smelled different all morning. Bates had noticed it first. It was a dry, spicy tang that didn‚Äôt belong. Langston caught it a few minutes later and dismissed it with a wrinkle of her nose. Even Wei paused on his way in, tilting his head slightly, as if trying to place a scent that tickled memory without name. Not unpleasant‚Ä¶ just odd. Like eucalyptus and stonefruit and sun on dust.

He wasn‚Äôt scheduled. Not for that day. Not even that shift. But there he was. He pushed the mop bucket in like it was any other day.

They looked at him with something close to confusion. Anomaly had become their language, and he didn‚Äôt belong in the model.

Bates stood halfway, her voice uncertain. ‚ÄúJulio? We pushed your shift. You‚Äôre not supposed to be here.‚Äù

Julio blinked, tilted his head. ‚ÄúI know. But the floors need me to clean them, so I came back.‚Äù Bates sniffed above the mop bucket without thinking. There was an herbal smell. It should have smelled of disinfectant but instead it smelled like the forest.

Langston straightened slowly, every part of her tensing. ‚ÄúCame back? You have been back since the lab closed for vacation?‚Äù

His smile was broad, unbothered. ‚ÄúThe driver said the docs are back, so I should come and clean. The floors are happy to have me here.‚Äù

He began to mop, slow, methodical swipes across already clean tile.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù Bates said again.

‚ÄúI saw the big doctor,‚Äù Julio said cheerfully. ‚ÄúHe doesn't mind. He set out cleaner for the vents.‚Äù

Langston stepped toward him, sharp. ‚ÄúWhat vents?‚Äù

He stopped mopping. Looked directly at her. ‚ÄúThe ones that buzz behind your skin. The ones that used to smell like bleach and melted crayons. Now they smell like strong arms in the sun.‚Äù

Wei moved in closer, voice gentle. ‚ÄúJulio, when did the big doctor give you the cleaner for the vents?‚Äù

Julio squinted at the ceiling, then beamed. ‚ÄúSince Tuesday. The day the green lights started singing.‚Äù

Wei did the math in his head. That would have been the morning after Devoste returned.

‚ÄúToday is Friday,‚Äù Bates whispered.

Julio pulled a small bunch of grapes from a cloth bag in his pocket and placed them gently on the desk. ‚ÄúFor the big doc. He's hungry. I can smell it.‚Äù Then he sat down cross-legged on the floor.

Bates said quietly to the other doctors, ""We assumed that Devoste had dosed himself several times. What if Devoste only took one and left rest of the MIMs atomizers on the counter when he removed one for himself. Julio might have mistaken them for filter deodorizers. The cleaning crews spray those onto the vents to take out the staleness. If it was sprayed on the surface, the aerosol would not have gone back into the trap. We thought the aerosol was only released in the containment room. If enough MIMs floated around the main lab to infect Julio it could still be lingering in the rest of the lab now. We could be infected.""

Langston‚Äôs hands dropped to her sides. Her voice came thin but louder. ‚ÄúJulio! How many people have you seen since Tuesday?‚Äù

Julio didn‚Äôt answer. He just rocked slightly, humming under his breath.

Bates knelt beside him and said gently. ‚ÄúJulio, I need you to think. Did you go home? Did you see your family?‚Äù

Julio smiled. ‚Äú*Mi abuela* made us all *caldo*. It smelled like safety.‚Äù

""Oh no,"" Bates whispered.

Langston sank into a chair. Her clipboard fell from her hands and hit the floor with a dull plastic knock. Her fingers twitched like they wanted to reorder reality.

No alarms. No breach. No villain. Just a hard working cleaner who used the wrong spray. Who hugged his grandmother. Who rode the bus.

The shell cracked. MIMs was out, and the gatekeepers were infected.

She‚Äôd push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn‚Äôt come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was ‚Äútoo messy.‚Äù

Every time I opened up, she'd say: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll just leave.‚Äù

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would‚Ä¶ and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn‚Äôt let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn‚Äôt going to a party  so I said I‚Äôd go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside‚Ä¶ her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: ‚ÄúShould we download an app and find you a hot girl?‚Äù


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn‚Äôt even check on me. Just said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt text you unless you text me first.‚Äù

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should ‚Äújust be friends.‚Äù But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn‚Äôt want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking  she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled‚Ä¶ then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I ‚Äúsent her to a mental clinic.‚Äù Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was ‚Äúlooking for her friend‚Äôs ex.‚Äù I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday  I didn‚Äôt go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

I went to see her photos and she looks super different, my cousin said she looks less depressed.

TL;DR: Dated a girl who constantly gave mixed signals  canceling plans, blocking me, guilt-tripping me, playing jealousy games, and keeping me at arm‚Äôs length while demanding closeness. Every time I opened up, she‚Äôd disappear or flip the script. Even after breaking up, she kept pulling me back with ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù texts while I later found her on dating apps. No matter how much I loved, showed up, or tried, it was never enough. It wasn‚Äôt love  it was a toxic push-pull cycle. I didn‚Äôt fail her; I just stopped abandoning myself.",0,1756036267.0,tifu,8,0.18,False

People were polite, but I could tell they didn't really want me around.

Then I started paying attention to the people everyone gravitated toward. Turns out, likability isn't some mysterious talent just specific behaviors anyone can learn.

Here are the 7 things that changed everything for me:

1. Ask questions about them, not about yourself. Instead of ""I went to that restaurant too!"" try ""What did you think of the food there?"" People love talking about themselves when someone genuinely cares.
2. Remember small details from previous conversations. ""How did your sister's wedding go?"" or ""Did you finish that book you mentioned?"" Shows you actually listen instead of just waiting for your turn to talk.
3. Give genuine compliments on things they chose. Don't compliment looks compliment decisions and skills. ""That's such a good point"" or ""I love how you decorated this place."" They feel proud instead of just flattered.
4. Match their energy level (but stay slightly calmer) If they're excited, be interested. If they're upset, be concerned. But always stay 10% more composed. You become the stable person they feel good around.
5. Use their name in conversations. Not every sentence, but sprinkle it in. ""That's funny, Sarah"" or ""What do you think, Mike?"" People subconsciously love hearing their own name.
6. Be the first to help, last to judge (something most people fail to do). Offer to grab coffee when they're stressed. Don't give advice unless they ask. Just be useful and supportive without making it about you. Most of the time people want to be heard not to be lectured.
7. Admit when you don't know something ""I have no idea about that, tell me more"" is way more likable than pretending to know everything. People enjoy teaching someone who's genuinely curious. The ""I know it all attitude"" is seen as annoying and weird avoid it.

Make every interaction about making THEM feel good about themselves, not about making yourself look good.

What I wish I'd known earlier is likability isn't about being funny, smart, or impressive. It's about being genuinely interested in other people and making them feel heard.

I'd read a lot on here about the various coffee shops and where is good to go. With only two weeks in the area I'd decided to pick the top few that regularly came up in the 'where is good for coffee' threads. 

My flight home is this weekend, so here's my experiences. Although I had a variety of coffee styles at various places I'll only rank like-for-like based on a drink I had at each one (Flat White).

1. Pauline's Park Rd (R42) - just the nicest flavour of the bunch and perfect temp. Basic decor & lovely staff. 
2. Hout Bay Coffee (R38) - also very nice taste and temperature. Quite a cool place, smells delicious. Staff seem pleasant.
3. Rosetta Claremont (R45) - very nice coffee. Similar to Pauline's in decor. Staff very friendly. Just not quite as good taste as Pauline's, and cheaper than Hout Bay for similar.
4. Truth Coffee (R60) - I mean, the venue is incredible, but the coffee quality, taste and temp was a definite lag behind the other three. Mainly seems like an aura farm and to be fair it's working. Expensive for the coffee quality (R60 is pretty far out) and staff seemed the least happy vs other places I tried. 

Bonus: 
- Balance Coffee (R30). A cafe/roastery at the Jonkershoek entrance gate. Very good coffee, lovely location, really nice owner. If you end up over that way give it a go. Would slot in above Truth Coffee in the list if it were in CPT.

Bad coffee:
- Vida e Caffe (seemingly all) (R38). They must reuse their grind or something, almost tasteless??

Plenty of other places had decent coffee but can't compare exactly as had different drinks, and weren't 'special', just decent. Includes Origin, Sentinel, and Woolworth's (surprisingly!).

All my opinion obviously as a foreigner. With my local city did coffee like you do in Cape Town!",4,1756035783.0,capetown,5,1.0,False

A coffee from this waitress

I mean look, she's an amateur

Let alone challenger

Would've thought she'd have better footwork as a traveller

So you work at Starbucks in Robloxia?

You're earnin' 0 stars and bucks, brah

Not even a raise, too?

That's gotta blow, dude

No family

So you don't have anyone next to you

I'm so fabulous

Your team's average

You're soft, like your work aprons fabric

Your work place is complete shit

So many lawsuits, it's makin' me sick

Toss her in and I'll show her the ropes

She'll learn quick how a real fighter goes for the throat

Better not be at the drive-thru, cause it has experience with chokes

With your pay, you might as well be broke

**Airsoftniko verse 1:**

Um, sir

Can I get your order now?

This is Starbucks

Please don't have a mental breakdown

I don't need tips, hard work is the reason for the money I gain

You're just another trash avatar, that's OP with powers so insane

Blood manipulation, portal power, and sorcerering around

You're following the rules of how to be a clown

Can snap me in half, crush my skull, and turn me into a donut?

What kinda power is that? Why can you just do that?

I'll hand it to ya, being half demon sounds fun

Unless your writing's being done by a kid who's super dumb

You adopted a girl and raised her as your own daughter?

That sounds sweet! ... What'll she do when she realises her dad's a monster?

You've got problems that you're brawling through

Can't think outside of the box, when there's a demon in you

Just a glance at your lore and your design

You're NOT 7 feet tall, you're a short guy

**Subject 0 verse 2:**

Alright, fine

You wanna meddle with this pro?

I want a coffee

Which kind? I don't give eeffoc, bro

And you're

Saying my lore's the most primitive shit that you've ever seen?

At least I got something, yours is a blank sheet

Seems finding love is a hopeless mission

Cause taking orders is your only social interaction

Don't get me started on workers throwing boiling coffees at customers

Starbucks arrested two black guys, who just wanted to use the bathroom, twerp

**Airsoftniko verse 2:**

That zero in your name can stand for so many things

Wins, girls, IQ, marriage rings

Why are you a knight? It isn't mentioned in the lore

You're a robot, demon, sorcerer, and a plain bore

Even in fights, you still stay on the ground

Must be cause all your insecurities are weighing you down

Creator

Threw the towel

Didn't bother to write well

The only time a demon

Isn't a good pair with hell

She‚Äôd push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn‚Äôt come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was ‚Äútoo messy.‚Äù

Every time I opened up, she'd say: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll just leave.‚Äù

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would‚Ä¶ and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn‚Äôt let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn‚Äôt going to a party  so I said I‚Äôd go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside‚Ä¶ her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: ‚ÄúShould we download an app and find you a hot girl?‚Äù


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn‚Äôt even check on me. Just said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt text you unless you text me first.‚Äù

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should ‚Äújust be friends.‚Äù But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn‚Äôt want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking  she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled‚Ä¶ then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I ‚Äúsent her to a mental clinic.‚Äù Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was ‚Äúlooking for her friend‚Äôs ex.‚Äù I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday  I didn‚Äôt go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

1myta6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1myta6z/the_ex_by_freida_mcfadden/,The Ex By Freida McFadden,"Hey everyone! Hope you're all having a fantastic day. I recently finished reading *The Ex By Freida McFadden*, and I just had to share my thoughts with you, like I'm catching up with a good friend over coffee. If you're looking for a quick, twisty read, you can check it out here: [The Ex By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-ex-by-freida-mcfadden/).

**A Quick Rundown (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**

This book plunges you into the life of a woman who just wants to escape her past and the man who utterly shattered her. When she finally thinks she's put him behind her, he reappears in the most unexpected and unsettling way. It's a classic McFadden setup: seemingly ordinary situations quickly spiral into something far more sinister and keeps you guessing about who is truly the victim and who is the villain. If you love a good psychological thriller that plays with your mind, this one definitely fits the bill.

**What Really Grabbed Me**

Freida McFadden has a real knack for creating characters you can't quite trust, and the protagonist here is no exception. Her voice is strong, and you feel her desperation and fear right from the start. I found myself constantly shifting my allegiance, wondering if she was telling the whole truth, which is exactly what you want in this genre. The writing style is incredibly direct and easy to follow ‚Äì no flowery language, just pure, unadulterated suspense that keeps you turning pages at lightning speed.

The pacing, as usual with McFadden, is excellent. It starts strong, builds tension steadily, and then delivers those signature twists that make you gasp out loud. I literally said ""Oh, COME ON!"" a couple of times, which is my highest compliment for a thriller author. The emotional rollercoaster is real; I felt a mix of frustration, anxiety, and a genuine urge to yell at some of the characters for their choices. It‚Äôs definitely a book that evokes strong reactions.

**What Might Not Be For Everyone**

While I enjoyed it immensely, I'd say if you're looking for deeply complex characters with intricate backstories or a literary masterpiece, this might not be your top pick. McFadden's strength lies in her plot twists and fast-paced narratives, sometimes prioritizing the ""what happens next?"" over profound character development. There were a couple of moments where I thought a character's decision felt a little forced to push the plot forward, but honestly, in a thriller this engaging, it‚Äôs a minor quibble.

**Would I Recommend It?**

Absolutely! If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, especially those with domestic suspense elements and a knack for surprising you, then *The Ex* is a solid choice. It's a quick, satisfying read that will keep you entertained and guessing until the very end. It's perfect for a rainy afternoon or a long journey. If you‚Äôre curious, you can find more details and perhaps grab a copy here: [The Ex By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-ex-by-freida-mcfadden/).

**A Little Pep Talk for New Readers**

If you're new to reading or just diving into thrillers, here are a few simple tips from me:

1.  **Don't Force It:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it's okay to put it down. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore!
2.  **Find Your Niche:** Experiment with different genres. You might discover you love fantasy, romance, or, like me, psychological thrillers.
3.  **Start Small:** Short, engaging books like *The Ex* are perfect for getting into the rhythm of reading. They offer a complete story without a huge time commitment.
4.  **Make It a Habit:** Try to set aside just 15-20 minutes a day. It adds up faster than you think, and soon you'll be finishing books without even realizing it.
5.  **Talk About It!** Sharing your thoughts, like I'm doing now, makes reading even more fun. It helps you process the story and connect with others.

Don't be afraid to jump into the world of books. There's a story out there waiting just for you! And if you're ready for a thrilling ride, give *The Ex* a go. You can easily find it and many other great reads to start your journey: [The Ex By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-ex-by-freida-mcfadden/).

1myt9p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWFC/comments/1myt9p7/it_might_not_be_that_bad/,It might not be that bad‚Ä¶,"It‚Äôs August and Wolves are terrible. Premier League Wolves are always terrible in August.

**The stadium is not great**, but the there are many teams in the Premier League with outdated stadiums. Jeff ‚Äòshould think before he speaks‚Äô Shi has stated that the Steve Bull is going to be refurbished. The current Molineux is a bloody carbuncle, but I‚Äôm glad that the club didn‚Äôt go ahead with the Steve Morgan vision of how the Molineux should look. That design is now a cheap, nasty eyesore. I hope Wolves keep a traditional four-stand setup. I think Fosuns major struggle regarding the stadium is what to do with the North Bank. It was built for Morgan‚Äôs vision and clearly doesn‚Äôt fit in with what Fosun want to do.

**The youth system is poor**. I can remember in the not too distant past when Wolves didn‚Äôt even have a youth system, never mind a poor youth system. **Wolves WERE that bad**. Wasn‚Äôt it Graham Taylor who introduced a youth system at Wolves? Nevertheless, Wolves‚Äô youth system does need to be improved. 99% of the players coming through are nowhere near good enough for Premier League Football, and the ones who show potential are almost always pinched by other clubs - something Wolves are guilty of. The days of Celtic winning the European Cup with 95% of their squad born within five miles of their stadium are over. When we produce talent they will almost always be pinched by bigger clubs. I‚Äôm certain Arsenal and Liverpool have both recently signed two talented players from our youth system. Matheus Man√©, a potential future star for Wolves, was signed from Rochdale, who signed him from a Portuguese team. Hugo Bueno has come from our youth system, but I doubt he was born in Wolverhampton. Kilman officially came through our youth system but we signed him from Maidenhead Utd. Wolves sold MGW, which is gut wrenching, but Villa have just had to sell Jacob Ramsey to comply with PSR.

**Wolves don‚Äôt have English players**. Signing English players is difficult because they carry a ludicrous tax. They‚Äôre overpriced in the extreme, and too many clubs who sell them either want a sell-on percentage, or a sell-on % and the right to buy them back for a low fee.

**Looking at the first team squad**, things are improving. It doesn‚Äôt look that way but they are.

Goalkeepers. Wolves are average at best in this area. Jos√© S√° is just about a Premier League goalkeeper, but the backup keepers are not. Wolves have been shafted in this area, partly due to Gary O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs pal coming in and recommending Sam Johnstone. At least O‚ÄôNeil‚Äôs pal was quickly sacked.

Defenders: A fully fit Mosquera is one of the best centre backs in the Premier League. Wolves will not risk him until they are sure he is ready. He‚Äôs 24 years of age and, for a centre-back, a pup. Bringing him in too early would be stupid. Wolves now have the wingbacks and fullbacks they need. Jackson and Bueno are the wingbacks and Hoever and Wolfe are the fullbacks. Lima needs to go out on loan. Doc is now a RCB. The club is buying a LCB. Agbadou needs a rocket up his arse, but, ignoring the own goal, he was improved against Bournemouth.

I‚Äôve ran out of steam and need a coffee, but if Wolves buy a LCB, midfielder and forward, everything will be fine. I can‚Äôt see a scenario where they won‚Äôt get these players, otherwise what will have been the point in setting up the wingback/fullback situation that VP clearly wants?

It‚Äôs easy to pick things apart when all isn‚Äôt well, but Wolves aren‚Äôt as bad as some fans think they are. Fer L√≥pez is the player who will link midfield to attack. He exudes class, but he‚Äôs not starting - what‚Äôs the point when VP doesn‚Äôt have the players he wants. Jhon Arias is a decent forward who‚Äôll play between L√≥pez and Larsen, but he needs to be brought in slowly, otherwise he‚Äôll be burnt out by January. His season started long ago and he played in the Club World Cup. I think when Arias is ready, L√≥pez will play.

The three forward system that Nuno and other coaches have deployed is not how VP sets up. This is why Rodrigo Gomes cannot get into the first team squad. He‚Äôs not a wingback, he‚Äôs a Neto type forward. It‚Äôs the same reason as to why Hwang Hee-chan cannot get into the team. He‚Äôs a striker who will not take Larsen‚Äôs place. Possibly for commercial reasons, Chan has mostly been used as a left-sided forward - and he has been rubbish - but VP does not play this system. I cannot think of a game when I have seen VP‚Äôs team start with a three forward system. It‚Äôs almost 1-1-1.

In pre season it was clear how VP wants to play. If Fosun does not bring the players in that he needs, when they‚Äôve had plenty of time to do so, then all the blame lies at their door.

It‚Äôs frustrating when Wolves are selling their best players and struggling to keep a consistent team together. Many Premier League clubs struggle with this due to the bigger teams cherry picking players from smaller clubs. It has been worse for Wolves over the last few seasons due to the club not properly investing in the first team until the January panic button is pressed. However, this season Wolves are trying to change that and they are investing earlier than normal. It‚Äôs taking time, due in part to Wolves needing to clear so many players out and lower the wage bill. I think Wolves also now recognise they have to be more diligent when buying players because they have wasted an incredible amount on garbage.

Brb, rethinking every ""See you"" ever.","The ""Last Meeting Theory"" is not a formal psychological theory but¬†a popular concept that suggests once two people have completed their personal journey and learned the lessons they were meant to share, the universe ensures their paths will never cross again.¬†It implies that a final encounter might have already occurred without you realizing it, signifying the definitive end of that relationship's purpose in your life.

TL;DR:

I didn‚Äôt know it was the last time. That‚Äôs the cruel part of the last meeting theory- you never do.  
The last time I saw my grandfather (73M), he was half asleep while I left for school. ‚ÄúTake care,‚Äù I said casually, without any weight to the words.

When people talk about the last meeting theory, it sounds dramatic until it happens to you. Then suddenly, every ‚Äúbye‚Äù you‚Äôve ever said feels too light, every handshake feels too rushed, every hug feels like it should have lasted longer. The ordinary moments take on an extraordinary weight in hindsight.

It taught me something brutal but necessary: you rarely get a warning before a goodbye becomes *the* goodbye. So now, when I leave someone I care about, even if it‚Äôs just after coffee- I make it count. I look them in the eye, I smile fully, I hug tightly. Because I don‚Äôt want my last memory with anyone to be half-hearted.

Maybe that‚Äôs the point of the last meeting theory. Not to scare us, but to remind us: if you want people to remember your presence with warmth, don‚Äôt save your love for later. Say it. Show it. Mean it, every single time.",1,1756035242.0,relationships,0,0.6,False

# The beginnings: The cradle of the Hungarian beer revolution

In the early 2010s, while the ruin pub concept was already popular, the **Budapest** beer market was still quite uniform, dominated by mass-produced **beers**. The Hungarian **craft beer** revolution needed a base, a place where small-scale breweries could showcase their products to the public. This bastion became **√âleszt≈ëh√°z** in 2013 when it opened its doors on the site of an abandoned glass factory.

The name of the place, ""√âleszt≈ë"" (Yeast), holds symbolic significance, referring to one of the most important ingredients in brewing, as well as to cultural and architectural revival. The owners' goal was to introduce the community to the culinary pleasure of **craft beers**. The initiative was successful, and the reputation and popularity of √âleszt≈ëh√°z have been unbroken ever since, with the place remaining one of the most important centers of **Budapest's** beer culture to this day.

Pairing food and **beer** is also a special science. It's worth choosing darker **beers** like stout or porter with the dishes from Butcher's Kitchen, while an IPA or a lager is a perfect match for the lighter sandwiches.

The location has strong pull factors ‚Äî Mt. Banahaw view, Kamay ni Hesus, the Pahiyas Festival, and the steady stream of tourist,balikbayans and business travelers.

The concept I‚Äôm exploring is a 3 floor hotel designed as:

Ground floor ‚Üí coffee shop + resto + function/conference hall

Second & third floors ‚Üí hotel/lodging units (number of rooms scale with funding)

To make the funding model secure and transparent, I‚Äôm considering a co-ownership structure:

‚úÖ 2.5M per co-owner

‚úÖ Each co-owner gets a 100 sqm titled lot (separate from the hotel property)

This means each co-owner holds a tangible and appreciating asset from day one

‚úÖ Equal profit sharing for 10 years (extendable)

‚úÖComplete notarized agreement

Note: Several celebrities have also purchased property in Lucban, which supports the strong investment atmosphere in the area

The idea is to create a professional but welcoming space ‚Äî a hotel that serves both tourists and events (weddings, conferences, retreats). With Lucban‚Äôs rising visibility, the timing looks promising.

1myt432,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1myt432/why_choose_the_travelers_club_richmond_spinner/,Why Choose the Travelers Club Richmond Spinner Carry-On Luggage? Comprehensive Review,"The Travelers Club TC-7920-420 Richmond Spinner Luggage has been part of my daily journeys for a couple of weeks now, and I‚Äôm ready to give an honest take on how it measures up. Whether for quick weekend getaways or cross-country trips, this carry-on doesn‚Äôt disappoint in some critical areas, but it does have a few traits that might not work for every traveler. Let‚Äôs break it all down.

**Modern Design Meets Functionality**  
The aesthetics caught my eye right away. This luggage comes in sleek, modern color options, and its design strikes a balance between professional and fashionable. The 22-inch carry-on size fits most airline overhead bins perfectly, and the fully-lined interior with an accessory pocket is not just visually appealing but also practical. I found the extra pocket perfect for keeping my smaller essentials neatly organized‚Äîideal for chargers, snacks, and travel documents.  

[Check Travelers Club TC-7920-420 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0b2z567h7/)

**Exceptional Mobility and Stability**  
One of my favorite features is the 360¬∞ spinner wheels. The four multi-directional wheels make maneuvering through crowded airports or uneven city streets an absolute breeze. I was able to glide through terminals effortlessly, even with a cup of coffee precariously balanced in one hand. Although the stability of the wheels impressed me, I did notice that they sometimes struggle slightly on very rough surfaces like cobblestones. That being said, on smooth floors, the movement is almost whisper-quiet and couldn‚Äôt be better.

**Compact Yet Spacious Interior**  
Packing for a three-day trip was shockingly easy with this 39.8-liter capacity. It‚Äôs compact enough to suit frequent flyers but spacious enough to fit all my needs. The storage compartment layout efficiently utilizes the interior space. In fact, I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to sacrifice much in terms of packing essentials. However, I wouldn‚Äôt rely on this piece if I needed to bring bulkier items, as the dimensions can limit what fits comfortably inside.

**Build Quality and Durability**  
For a carry-on weighing just 6 pounds, the durability surprised me. Despite being lightweight, the luggage held up remarkably well against baggage carousel mishaps and being shoved into overhead bins. The handle mechanism, featuring a push-button recessed locking system, feels sturdy and locks securely in place. A minor gripe, though, is that the outer shell doesn‚Äôt seem as scratch-resistant as some premium luggage options. After a few trips, light scuff marks were visible on the surface, but they‚Äôre purely cosmetic.

**Highlights**  
- 4 spinner wheels for excellent mobility.  
- Lightweight construction at only 6 pounds.  
- Fully-lined interior with ample organizational space.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Outer shell attracts minor scratches over time.  
- Wheels can struggle on very rough terrain.  
- Limited capacity for bulkier items.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this luggage to other options like Samsonite‚Äôs Winfield 2 Hardside or the Amazon Basics Hard Shell Spinner, the Richmond Spinner holds its ground impressively well given its price range. While Samsonite boasts better scratch resistance and a more premium build, it also comes with a higher price tag. On the other hand, the Amazon Basics option might slightly beat this one on affordability but drops the ball on wheel durability and ease of handling. The Richmond Spinner‚Äôs 360¬∞ wheels and sleek design are its trump cards in this stand-off.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Speaking of price, this is where the product truly shines. It delivers premium features and a satisfying travel experience without breaking the bank. Given its sturdy frame, efficient storage, and smooth handling, it offers strong value in this category of luggage. Although it‚Äôs not the ultimate solution for globe-trotters needing ultra-durable or scratch-proof baggage, it excels in comfort and functionality for short-term trips or light travelers.

It‚Äôs such a subtle yet uplifting fragrance that I might have been accused of sniffing the bottle a bit too often.

**Ease of Use and Efficiency**  
This dish soap isn‚Äôt one of those that takes you forever to rinse off (thank goodness). A little squeeze goes a long way. It cuts through grease surprisingly well without leaving a filmy residue on pans or plates. I tested it on some of my most challenging messes‚Äîbaked-on casserole dishes and glasses smeared with oily fingerprints. Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs really holds its weight. That being said, folks with a habit of overloading their suds might not find the foam density to last as long as they‚Äôd want.

**Ingredients and Environmental Friendliness**  
I‚Äôm always skeptical about products claiming to be plant-based or eco-friendly. However, this dish soap contains biodegradable ingredients like plant-derived cleaners, so it does make me feel less guilty about dumping sudsy water down the drain. It avoids parabens, phthalates, and animal-derived additives, which is perfect if you‚Äôre paying attention to sustainability‚Äîor simply trying to avoid chemical-laden products. Bonus points for being cruelty-free! I feel like I‚Äôm doing at least one nice thing in my day while tackling a chore.

**Strengths**  
- Effective grease removal even on stubborn messes  
- Lovely seasonal scent that lingers just long enough  
- Plant-based, biodegradable formula that‚Äôs kinder to the environment  
- Cruelty-free and free from harsh chemicals  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Not as long-lasting suds compared to some competitors  
- Fall-specific scents might not appeal to everyone all year round  

**Packaging and Size**  
The no-frills bottle design works just fine‚Äîfunctional but not fancy. It‚Äôs slim enough to leave by the sink without taking up too much real estate, though at 16 fl oz, I did find myself wondering how long it would last. For families who crank through dish soap like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, this might be a ""stock up often"" kind of product.

**Peer Products**  
Comparing it to something like Dawn Ultra, Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs feels much more natural and subtly luxurious in its scent. Dawn might beat it in the suds game for sheer foam longevity, but I always end up wondering what kind of science lab chemicals are packed into those blue bubbles. Seventh Generation is another eco-friendly option but lacks the same fragrant aura; their dish soap smells functional, if that makes sense. Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs edges out competitors on the ""smell good, feel good"" scale while keeping performance up to par.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
If you‚Äôve got budget on your brain, this dish soap sits in a slightly higher price bracket than the mega-jug store brands you'll see at big-box stores. However, for what you‚Äôre getting‚Äîa high-performing dish soap with a great scent, plant-based ingredients, and environmental conscientiousness‚Äîit‚Äôs worth the upgrade. While not the cheapest, it‚Äôs like paying for good coffee instead of grabbing stale gas station java‚Äîit makes the experience so much better.

# Here Your Link : [**https://writers.thepetsloyal.com/attention-1/**](https://writers.thepetsloyal.com/attention-1/)

My whole life has been stuck on silent mode. The reason?¬†

My little sister Stella has depression, and according to our family doctor, even a sneeze could apparently¬†

send her into a total spiral.¬†

So no laughing in the house. No crying in pain.¬†

Couldn‚Äôt even scream when I got hurt.¬†

Mom and Dad would always pull me aside with guilty looks:¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a good girl, sweetheart. Helping Stella get better is a family effort. You‚Äôre the strong one-just¬†

be patient with her, okay?‚Äù¬†

However, that day, I accidentally knocked over my water glass.¬†

The crash immediately sent Stella into a complete meltdown.¬†

For the first time ever, Dad lost it on me.¬†

‚ÄòCan‚Äôt you be more careful? What, you trying to kill her?!‚Äù¬†

He shoved me hard. I hit the floor, causing my head slamming into the corner of the coffee table.¬†

Blood started pooling beneath me.¬†

Yet everyone was only swarming around my screaming sister. Nobody looked at me.¬†

I lay there on the cold hardwood, feeling everything fade to black.¬†

They all figured Stella‚Äôs breakdown was the real emergency. My little head injury could wait.¬†

But, too bad, brain bleed? It will kill people in any SECOND.¬†

Jay there on the cold floor, sharp pain pulsing through the back of my skull,¬†

Warm blood trickled down my neck, pooling into a small dark puddle on the hardwood,¬†

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you be more careful? What, you won‚Äôt be happy until you drive her over the edge?‚Äù¬†

O¬†

Chapter 1¬†

Dad‚Äôs voice was still ringing in my ears.¬†

The bleeding was getting worse.¬†

On the couch, my sister Stella curled into a ball, hands pressed tight over her ears, letting out piercing¬†

screams:¬†

‚ÄúShe did it on purpose! She‚Äôs trying to kill me! Make her go away! Go away!‚Äù¬†

Mom dropped to her knees in front of her, rubbing her back and whispering:¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, baby, it‚Äôs okay. Mommy‚Äôs here. The mean sister is gone now.‚Äù¬†

I tried to push myself up, but a wave of dizziness hit me and I collapsed back down.¬†

My vision started going black around the edges, darkness creeping in.¬†

‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ Mom‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice came out barely a whisper.¬†

Nobody turned around.¬†

My vision kept getting hazier, and memories started flashing through my mind.¬†

I‚Äôd been practically running home that day, clutching my honor roll certificate.¬†

‚ÄúMom, I got-‚ÄúI burst through the front door, breathless with excitement.¬†

Mom frantically grabbed the certificate from my hands and shoved it into a drawer.¬†

‚ÄòRiley, don‚Äôt let your sister see this.‚Äù¬†

She lowered her voice, ‚ÄúYou know how it is. Your good grades trigger her.‚Äù¬†

I stood frozen in the doorway, still holding my hand out, my smile dying.¬†

‚ÄúBut Mom, this is my first time making honor roll!‚Äù My voice cracked.¬†

‚ÄúMy teacher said I could get into any school‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a good girl, sweetheart.‚Äù Mom touched my hair, guilt in her eyes.¬†

‚ÄúHelping Stella get better is a family effort. You‚Äôre the strong one, the healthy one. Just keep being patient with her, okay?‚Äù¬†

I nodded and went to my room, choking down all that hurt.¬†

Chapter 1¬†

The blood pool on the floor kept spreading.¬†

My breathing turned shallow, white spots flashing across my vision.¬†

‚ÄòMom, I‚Äôm hurt!‚Äù I reached out weakly.¬†

Mom finally looked over, but annoyed. ‚ÄúRiley, not now. Can‚Äôt you see Stella‚Äôs having a breakdown? We‚Äôll¬†

deal with it in a minute.‚Äù¬†

Stella‚Äôs screaming got louder. ‚ÄúMake her go away! I hate her!‚Äù¬†

She grabbed a mug from the coffee table and threw it at the wall.¬†

t shattered everywhere.¬†

Dad rushed over to her like she was made of glass.¬†

Stella, baby, Daddy‚Äôs here. You‚Äôre okay.‚Äù His voice went all soft.¬†

That mean sister can‚Äôt hurt you anymore.‚Äù¬†

My fingers scraped weakly across the hardwood, only leaving a bloody smear.¬†

Out of the remaining 10, five spend the entire day drinking coffee and eating donuts. That leaves us with the five actual workers: the CEO, a front-end dev, a back-end dev, a database guy, and a general manager whose main job is probably asking, ‚Äúso‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù

The last patch is living proof of this setup: no rationality, no systematics, no logic. Just a Frankenstein mess of a random fix here, a rework there, a visual tweak thrown in, and a rebrand over there to make it look shiny. It feels like everyone was given a ‚Äúfree project 3 month,‚Äù and when the deadline came, the CEO just said: ‚Äúbundle it all together and push it live.‚Äù

Season 3 (*Ancient of the Skies*) was exactly that: No content to hold 1 week of season. Content that looks like it was cobbled together the night before release. No structure, no foundation, no real ‚Äúcore‚Äù to the Season. It‚Äôs as if the company thought, ‚Äúeh, we‚Äôll figure it out when launch is close enough.‚Äù

But here‚Äôs the thing: **a live-service game is not a fan project**. On **Day 1 of Week 1**, the entire Season should already be defined. Mechanics, design, systems, loot, the core identity ‚Äî all of it. From there, you build the framework, refine it, then polish it. Three months isn‚Äôt time to experiment, it‚Äôs time to execute. But EHG seems stuck in ‚Äúlaid-back indie dev mode,‚Äù where everyone just does whatever they feel like, and then near the end they scramble to duct-tape it all together.

The result? A weak Season, with no clear identity, that screams **amateur hour**. And in today‚Äôs market, that kind of approach only leads one way: straight to collapse. Because the reality is this: **efficiency has to be absolute**. There‚Äôs no room for slacking off or pushing out random patchwork updates.",0,1756034495.0,LastEpoch,14,0.06,False

I know she wouldn't do it, but as she is quite inexperienced, I'm worried she is not getting some vital signals.

Right now, we got some differing opinion about what a guy she is talking to might have in terms of intentions.

My opinion is that there is a 98% chance that he is gonna try to make a move on her at some point. Hers is that he is just trying to be nice and awkward with English as a second language.

Here are the facts:

* They randomly met on-campus, a year ago, before we were together. That is the only real life face to face conversation they had. He instantly asked for her social media, which she gave him. I don't know exactly when, but some time close to that, she mentioned she had a (fake, at that time) boyfriend because he was asking and she wasn't interested. In my mind, randomly asking a cute girl for contact info, without any context between them, is highly likely to be flirty, but she doesn't see it that way.

* they irregularly conversed on Instagram, she doesn't put any effort in, sometimes only replies after days. Someday during that phase, we met and became a couple.

* Some time some way, she gives her number and they converse more regularly.

* Here is some topics he started. All the messages below he sent after he already knew about her relationship status, we have also got a profile picture with both of us:

     * Trying to bond over similar interests. 
     
     * Multiple times asking about her relationship status, after she told him she has a boyfriend, asking her whether it's a ""situationship"" (worst offence in my opinion, what a weird  and offensive question that is to ask as a relative stranger). 
     * After talking about vacations, articulating his wish to go on vacation with her

     * She told him she just got a massage in a spa, he replies that he learned massaging from youtube for his (I guess, ex-) girlfriend and his quote  ""massaging is better if two people do it. Just the truth""
     * Just regularly messaging stuff like ""I like you =)"" or ""my lovely [name]"" (roughly translated)
     * Asking for meeting up for coffee or taking a walk.

I want my girlfriend to either cease communication, or at least proactively, so not just in response to some of his advances, tell him in clear terms she is not interested. Right now, she rejects the advances as they appear but it's all quite mushy, if I'm being honest. I need to know whether I'm out of line to demand that.

To be honest, through her low self esteem, she cannot see anyone having romantic designs on her (that's been hard for her in our relationship too, I need to continually reaffirm my attraction, which I do gladly). So she, in my opinion misses the most obvious clues some flirty guys give her, which is OK if they leave her alone after she mentions me, but in this case, I find it quite offensive that this guy continues pushing, after learning about our relationship.

I don't need total confirmation obviously just second opinions from strangers on the internet. To be honest, my head is spinning a little bit and I don't know whether I'm right. She has asked me not to talk about that with any of my real life friends, so I'm putting my trust in you anonymous reddit strangers. Please give your assessment",1,1756034339.0,Advice,8,1.0,False

This world is like modern day and every one can become a wizard but it is a hard skill to get into. Yu is a person who really wants to be a wizard but their mentor, Michael, doesn't think they can do it because they've been trying to learn their first spell for months but they still haven't, but he does say that if Yu learns their first spell, they can go to wizard city. Yu and Michael live in Goobyville. the news appears: the grand wizard had been killed by Eustace Twizzly who is now the Grand Wizard. Grand Wizards are like the presidents of the world or continent or whatever and whichever wizard is the strongest is it. Eustace Twizzly is evil. Michael freaks out because of this and is all panicky and stuff. And while he is being all worried, Yu learns their first spell which is called sparkle sprinkle. Michael is like ""wow"" and says that he'll take Yu to wizard city in the morning so they can learn spells from other wizards and maybe also defeat Eustace Twizzly or something. in the morning, the two of them go to wizard city, but are met with a group of 50 or so people protesting Eustace Twizzly and some of the new wizard laws he's been enforcing. 2 notable wizards from this crowd are named Hazel Grimshaw (who is a human) and Johnny Skateboard (who is a spirit). Eustace comes down to stop the protesting and eventually stops it. Hazel and Johnny team up with Yu and Michael to stop Eustace Twizzly. Yu, Michael, Hazel and Johnny decide to traverse across various places in wizard world to get more wizards to help stop Eustace Twizzly and to help Yu with learning more spells. They take a train to the first place they are going to (idk what it would be called). When they are at the first place and are walking to somewhere nearby (idk where), they meet a dwarf lawyer named Martin Jones who joins the party so he could get to the place where he needs to do lawyer stuff. And then after the stuff in that place, they get captured by pirates, and meet the daughter of the two captains, Lyra Nerida who is an elf astronomer wizard. The captains are named Murphy and Calypso. Lyra joins the party and they eventually team up with the pirates and then they drop them of in their next location which is were they meet Lilith the ghost hunter goblin along with her nephew Greg. Lilith was hired by Eustace to banish any spirits who don't have jobs or aren't useful including Johnny but she eventually joins the party. Then they get back to Wizard City to see it is like in ruin kinda and then they go to the big Grand Wizard building to fight Eustace Twizzly but before that they have to do a test and this test is a game show run by Eustace's second in command who's name is Basil. They do the game show and then fight Eustace Twizzly and then win by destroying the crystal in his chest which turns him back to normal I guess and maybe the gods congratulate the party I guess.

WIZARD LORE TIME

There are a couple of main species in Wizards the Game. These are:

Humans (what Yu and Hazel are), live until around 80

Cat-Folk (Humanoid Cat Furry People, also what Michael is), also live until around 80

Goblins, live until around 50

Dwarves, live until around 750 but the max is 1000.
Dwarves also perceive and process things quicker than other races. dwarf age chart:

15: 5 physically
25: 15 physically
50: 25 physically
100: 30 physically
200: 35 physically
300: 40 physically
400: 45 physically
500: 50 physically
600: 55 physically
700: 60 physically
800: 65 physically
900: 70 physically
1000: 80 physically

Elves, live until around 160. They age the same as humans until around 18 where it slows down.

There are also spirits, which are what people's souls become when they die. Spirits have no memory of who they were before they died, but they can remember some things if they see something or someone that had significance to them when they were alive. Spirits don't have most gendered features (important with Johnny Skateboard). Maybe spirits can change their appearance (like giving themselves gendered features!!!!!!!) by using a spell or something but it would take some time like if they wanted the change their appearance it wouldn't happen instantaneously. Spirits can also be from any species, in the case of Johnny Skateboard, he was a human. Some people use a spirit-banishing spell to remove a spirit from existence for good.

There'd also be a large group of pirates that fled to the seas many years ago as they thought that the Grand Wizard system is dumb and decided to live at sea because that's the only place where laws don't apply.

Magic in Wizards the Game comes from a mineral called venefite (it's just wizard in Latin mixed with the suffix -ite) and that came from a meteor that crash landed around 50,000-100,000 years ago. Venefite releases little tiny particles into the air and those particles flow through people I guess and do magic. Eustace Twizzly has a venefite crystal directly in his chest which is what makes him so powerful. Most venefite crystals have sunk deep into the ground because of something and that means that most present-day wizards don't know it exists so they just assume magic is just something you're born with. Sometimes venefite crystals burst out of the ground and make magic stuff happen. Wizards can also cast spells with anything as long as they do it correctly (though the most commonly used thing is a staff). Pointy hats aren't required, but they do make casting spells easier.

Characters:

Yu (They/Them), 12 years old, human

They are adventurous and optimistic I suppose and they might also have self doubt and be a bit stubborn. They would use a wand to cast spells. There could be a lore drop at some point about how Yu and Hazel were actually siblings. Their arc would be about them being less optimistic and naive about the world as they realise how serious it is and also them being more confident and also some stuff with Hazel. Also they have ADHD. Their favourite meal is pizza and their favourite drink is apple juice.

Michael (He/Him), 39 years old, cat-folk, aroace

Michael is Yu's mentor and is a silly cat guy! He is probably quite clumsy and kind but can also get worried about things. He would wear a purple wizard's robe and purple wizard's hat. Him and Eustace Twizzly used to be classmates at Stewart Academy. He would use a staff to cast spells. His arc would be about him being more confident and him not feeling guilty about underestimating Yu and not stopping Eustace sooner. He is emotional. His favourite meal is cottage pie and his favourite drink is tea.

Eustace Twizzly (He/Him), 42 years old, human, too busy being evil to have a relationship

Eustace had always researched the idea of fusing a venefite crystal into someone's body to amplify their magic powers (to like learn more stronger spells for good). One day (after he was out of school), he managed to place a venefite crystal directly into his chest, which at first had proven to be useful in amplifying Eustace's magical powers, but it soon corrupted Eustace Twizzly's mind. When he had successfully became the Grand Wizard (Where he actually killed the previous Grand Wizard instead of just defeating them in the wizard battle) he started enforcing new laws that he claimed where to ""help spread peace across the world"" but in reality just silenced anyone that disobeyed him. I think it would be interesting if over the course of the game, the stronger the venefite crystal in Eustace Twizzly's chest gets, it would slowly corrupt him more and more, even effecting his physical appearance and it could even get a mind of it's own. The only way for him to slow down the corruption could be to use some sort of healing spell. Eventually at the end of the game during the final bossfight with him, he would at first seem to still look like a regular human, but would eventually reveal the monstrous, eldritch-like monster that the Venefite crystal has turned him into. This idea was based on Emperor Belos from The Owl House and The Boss from Just Shapes and Beats because they both turned into some monstrous creature by trying to get power. He uses his hands to cast spells but he used to use a staff. His favourite meal is steak and his favourite drink is wine.

Hazel Grimshaw (She/Her), 19 years old, human, bi

Hazel is a very bold and confident person and she claims that she has no fears (she is lying she is afraid of spiders and being alone) and I think it would be interesting if the spider thing was revealed when they fight a big spider boss and she has a panic attack or something. Also, she might be afraid of spiders because her and Yu's parents were killed by a giant spider or something but Yu doesn't remember because they blocked out the memory. Also she's strong. She uses a spell book to cast spells. Her arc would be about learning to be more vulnerable around people and not hiding behind a tough personality (she would still be cool though). Her favourite meal is spicy chicken wings and her favourite drink is Monster Energy.

Johnny Skateboard (He/They), 20 when he died, has been dead for 4 years, human spirit, pan

Johnny Skateboard built his new spirit personality after the first thing they saw when he woke up as a spirit, a skateboard. He would use lots of words like gnarly, tubular and radical and is also very cool and laid-back. They would wear some black shoes, some ripped jeans, a red leather jacket, a pair of sunglasses and a backwards cap. Throughout the adventure, there could be some things that were significant to Johnny when he was alive which could cause them to remember their life. This would have there some subtle hints that eventually reveal that when he was alive, Johnny was actually a girl. But after remembering this, he still stays as being Johnny Skateboard because they like being a guy (Transgender Icon!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!?). he also uses a skateboard to cast spells. His arc would be about him accepting who he used to be. His favourite meal is burger and their favourite drink is Fanta.

Martin Jones (He/Him), 542 years old (57 physically/mentally), dwarf, straight

Martin is a grumpy, burnt-out and impatient dwarf lawyer who is constantly tired as his job requires him to go to many different places to do lawyer stuff. He wears a dark grey suit and red tie. The party meets him in a pub or cafe where he joins because they are heading to a place that he needs to do lawyer stuff at and he's late for the lawyer stuff. Maybe the path to the place would get blocked off so the party has to do a detour. He hasn't learnt any magic despite having plenty of time to do so, because he believes magic is too unpredictable and unreliable. He thinks this because he lost his wife (Sharon Jones) due to some sort of magical accident. He'd secretly be a romantic. Also he's so old that he still has a relatively normal sounding surname. His arc would be about him learning to trust magic more and to be less grumpy towards the other party members. He also talk a lot about like laws and stuff and he always follows laws and rules. Maybe during the detour, him and Johnny are in a tense situation against a big snake or something, and Martin unknowingly / accidentally / spontaneously shoots out like a massive powerful laser beam spell. His favourite meal is fried egg and his favourite drink is beer (or coffee).

Lyra Nerida (She/They), 17, elf, lesbian

Lyra is a clever, curious and also a bit shy of a person and a bit of a people pleaser. And also they would definitely be autistic and a freaking nerd. She comes from a long line of pirates and their parents are the captains of the ship. Their parents would give her the job of navigator on the ship, but she doesn't want to be a navigator or a pirate, they want to be an astronomer (she still likes wearing the pirate clothes though). They also learn spells and stuff in secret because her parents abolished magic from being used in their crew as the two of them say that magic isn't a real weapon of something and they'd use like cutlasses or something. Her arc would be about them not knowing whether to pick bring a pirate or bring an astronomer/wizard, and all the struggles that could create. She uses a crystal ball to cast spells. They'd also become Hazel's girlfriend at some point. Her favourite meal is fish and chips and their favourite drink is strawberry milk.

Murphy and Calypso Nerida (He/Him for Murphy, She/Her for Calypso), elves, 40-50 in elf years, both straight

Lyra's parents are pirate captains. The two of them would be quite intense when it comes to pirate stuff and they would have forbidden anyone in their crew from learning magic because it's too connected to the Grand Wizard system and stuff and also spells could be a safety issue for the other members of the crew. The two of them would be more chiller when not commanding their crew or anything. Murphy would be the more caring parent towards Lyra and he would support Lyra's want to be a wizard and a astronomer. But Calypso, wouldn't be supportive. She'd also have anger issues and would be like emotionally closed off I guess (she'd still be like a badass pirate though).

Lilith (She/It), 18 (30 physically/mentally), goblin, too busy with spirit banishing for relationships

Lilith is a silent, ominous and mysterious ghost hunter who was hired by Eustace Twizzly to banish any spirits who don't have jobs or aren't doing anything useful (including Johnny) and also take out the rebellion (the party). She'd be a reoccurring rival in the part of the game where she was introduced but maybe their could be little glimpses of it before she's fully introduced. She also takes care of its nephew Greg who would accompany her while it's doing her job. She'd somehow be convinced to join the party. Her backstory is that her sister (aka Greg's mother) got really sick and Greg's dad had to spend all of his time taking care of her which meant he couldn't take care of Greg so they made Lilith take care of him. But Lilith couldn't really take care of herself and Greg at the same time because she didn't have enough money to feed both of them so it took the ghost hunting job to get some extra cash (and she also was eventually hired by Eustace Twizzly). She used to feel regret after she banished a spirit but it eventually became desensitized to it, aswell as becoming more cold and distant. She used to think that spirits were just useless remnants of past lives but after seeing Johnny Skateboard, who was actually making some changes to the world and making people happier, it starts to feel regretful. Maybe she's a bit sassy and sarcastic and she likes to break rules/laws. Maybe it's narcissistic? Would be high energy maybe because she's part of the race with the shortest lifespan. She uses a lantern to cast spells. Her favourite meal is tomato soup and its favourite drink is water.

Greg (He/Him), 4 (7 mentally/physically), goblin

I think it would be silly if Lilith has to take care of her nephew Greg while it's ghost hunting and pursuing the party, so the little guy could be like a comic relief goofball (and they also would have a cool dynamic with Lilith and it would show that she isn't completely heartless). Lilith always calls him Gregory. Also Greg is very silly and tries to seem intimidating to ghosts that Lilith is banishing to impress her (it doesn't impress her). Maybe he'd also say that like wizards are stupid and he'll never be one or something when he's in the same scene as the main party.

Basil (They/Them, also Genderfluid ooo), 38 (28 physically/mentally), elf, idk what their sexuality could be

Basil is Eustace's second in command who runs the awesome game show. They would be very charismatic and dramatic. They would've decided to make the test before fighting the Grand Wizard be a game show when Eustace became the Grand Wizard and they became his second in command. Maybe they became Eustace's second in command because they knew eachother from school and they supported Eustace in his venefite crystal stuff. And they're just hyperfixated on game shows. Maybe they don't like what's happened to Eustace but can't leave him because of how long the two of them have been like working together so they just mask the worries and stuff behind the flamboyant personality and stuff.

Character's Families:

As mentioned earlier, Yu and Hazel are siblings. And their parents are dead (due to a massive spider). This is probably why they were separated and don't know eachother (they were put in an orphanage maybe or they were just abandoned and Michael adopted only Yu or something).

Michael's parents are very much alive and well and he visits them every year (Yu comes with him to visit them).

Johnny's parents are still alive and are looking for him but they would be looking for alive him who is a girl so if they ever encounter Johnny (which would probably happen so there is some lore stuff) they wouldn't recognise them.

Dwarves stay in mostly isolated communities because if they got close to anyone of a different race they'd die at some point and the dwarf would be heartbroken. Martin's parents are in one of these communities, but Martin left when he was like 50 so he could be a lawyer.

Why Do People Want to Be Wizards?:

There are many reasons why you would want to be a wizard and have magic powers:

Practical use
Having magical powers could be useful for many jobs and things like builders, engineers or doctors (though I think regular healing spells would only really work on wounds that aren't too serious like cuts or bruises so there's still a reason for doctors to exist). Magic would also be good for transportation (though using a teleport spell or something similar would use alot of energy and would make you very tired) or farming.

To look cool
Being a wizard gives you respect among others and it also looks cool. A reason for learning magic could also be something culture or personal growth related, and wizard battles are quite important to culture in wizard world.

Origin of the Grand Wizard System:

When venefite first came to  wizard world, people quickly started causing chaos with their newfound magical powers. So to help turn wizard society into a more civilised place, the Grand Wizard system was formed (around 1000 years before the events of the game). This system is quite simple, whoever is the most magically skilled wizard (which is decided by a wizard battle), gets to be the president of wizard world I guess. A Grand Wizard's duties include:

Stopping people from using magic for evil.

Enforcing new laws to make the world a better place.

Helping inexperienced wizards learn.

The first Grand Wizard was called Reginald Stewart and he helped found Wizard City.

Gods:

I think it would be neat if gods in the wizards the game universe were just magical immortal goobers that lived in space and watched over planets. There are three gods that watch over Wizard World (they are also the ones that created the venefite meteor):


Creation (She/They/It), nickname is Rhea

Creation is really optimistic, bubbly, gentle and nurturing and they're kinda like the parent of the three gods, with her taking care of the other two the most. Her favourite party members are Yu and Michael. Her favourite meal is salad or something and their favourite drink is herbal tea.

Change (They/It), nickname is Angie

Change is impulsive, restless, dramatic and sometimes anxious. They don't like when things stay the same for too long. Their favourite party members are Johnny, Lyra and Lilith. Their favourite meal and drink are constantly changing.

Destruction (He/They/It), nickname is Dess

Destruction is dry, sarcastic, chaotic and loves seeing things be destroyed. He might have anger issues. His favourite party members are Hazel and Martin. His favourite meal is rocks and they don't have a favourite drink.

The three of them are implied to be in a polycule and they would live in a house in the moon. Here's how I think the origin for Wizard World's gods could be:

The three of them are bored in space doing nothing. They decide to look for a planet to watch over. They find Earth. They give it the venefite meteor because it looked boring and maybe also to see their morality or something.

Character voice and design stuff:

Party members:

Yu:
I've literally only thought of them as looking like a child with a wizard hat on. Like that's it. Idk how they'd sound.

Michael:
His clothes are already explained in the big block of text. His fur pattern however, would be like tabby pattern I guess and maybe like brown or grey. He'd be a bit fat I guess because why not. I've always imagined him as sounding like Kinger from The Amazing Digital Circus.

Hazel:
I originally imagined her having more like orange and red colours in her clothes and like more casual clothes but recently I've imagined her wearing like punk/goth clothes which could be cool but idk if I would go with that. She'd have long brown hair and she'd be like average weight I suppose. I imagine her voice being like Amity Blight from The Owl House (specifically in season 1).

Johnny:
Basically his entire design is explained already in the big text except for his face, which I think would have like a little bit of stubble like beard hairs because I think that's cool (he would've gotten those using the ever iconic spell that can change the appearance of spirits including giving them gender features‚Ñ¢). Originally I was gonna make spirits faceless but I decided that's weird. He'd sound like the character Ross from Bee and Puppycat.

Martin:
He'd basic just look like Senshi from Dungeon Meshi but In a suit. He might sound like him too or he would sound like David Tennant because it would be funny.

Lyra:
She would wear some pirate clothes like a hat and stuff and would also maybe have long blonde hair. She'd maybe have like kinda tanned looking skin because like being on a boat all day, you're gonna be in the sun a lot (and also I've like imagined her parents being black so it would be weird if she was completely white) but idk if the will be tanned. She might sound like Marcy from Amphibia.

Lilith:
She would be like a goblin in like a cloak and stuff. That's really all I've thought about her design. Maybe she would sound like Eda from The Owl House or Peridot from Steven Universe.

Characters that are related to party members:

Murphy:
He'd basically just look like a humanised version of Captain Caviar Cookie from Cookie Run Kingdom. He could sound like Andrias from Amphibia.

Calypso:
Cool badass pirate woman. That's all. And she'd sound like Rye Cookie from Cookie Run Kingdom.

Greg:
Think little goblin child guy. Idk how he'd sound.

Antagonists:

Eustace:
Idk evil wizard guy with a beard. He'd sound like Belos from The Owl House.

Basil:
They'd probably have like brown curly hair. Maybe they have those beard stubble things that I mentioned with Johnny depending if they're presenting more masc or fem. They'd wear a cool suit and skirt combo. Maybe they sound like Reigen from Mob Psycho 100 or Hunter from The Owl House (specifically when he is the golden guard).

Gods:

Creation (Rhea):
She'd wear like a pretty pink and green dress with flowers blooming on it. She'd also have pink hair and maybe she's really tall. They'd sound like Moonlight Cookie from Cookie Run Kingdom.

Change (Angie):
I've thought of them wearing like an orange and purple jester outfit but idk about that. Maybe they just wear casual clothes like a hoodie and trousers (they can shapeshift though). They might sound like Weird Al.

Destruction (Dess):
Idk how they would look but I think he would sound like Temeluchus from Dead End: Paranormal Park.

Other Stuff:

The first names of people would stay relatively regular but last names used to be normal but over centuries they became more whimsical.

There aren't like fully dedicated wizard schools but learning spells and stuff is just a subject in regular schools.

The technology wouldn't be completely modern, it would instead be more like from 2005-2015. I may not be very knowledgeable on that era of technology, but what I do know is that having the more futuristic modern tech in a world with fantasy wizards would be weird.

Martin and Lilith could be implied to have feelings for eachother. Maybe it's like a love-hate relationship ship kinda like Lego Batman and Lego Joker.

Maybe there's a random spirit NPC guy that appears sometimes called Ping Pong Paul. He would've actually been Paul when he was alive unlike Johnny who wasn't Johnny when he was alive. This is because he has remembered everything about his old life.

Maybe in a sequel or dlc or something some sort of cult for the gods appears and like Destruction like actually shows himself to the cult and chills with them while Creation and Change ask the party to deal with the cult because they don't want to interfere with the world. Maybe either like Lyra gets completely taken into the cult and Dess makes them forget the party so there's like doomed yuri with Hazel.

There could be like illegal venefite trade or something.

Here's how the episodes could be if it was a show:

Season 1:

Ep 1:

Eustace Grand Wizard

Yu learn Sparkle Sprinkle

Go to wizard city

Meet Hazel and Johnny in protest

Eustace stops protest

Hazel explains awesome plan (go across the world to find more wizard to join in the rebellion), Michael is cautious to join but Yu is enthusiastic

Lilith fails but blocks the way forward so they need to take a detour in a cave

ep 3:

Cave stuff, Martin and Johnny get separated from the party

Martin is about to go do lawyer stuff when pirates appear

ep 4:

Party has been kidnapped on the pirate ship, meet Lyra who explains what's happening and who she is and how she doesn't want to be the pirate captain after her parents retire and how she wants to be an astronomer and a wizard

Hazel gets seasick so Lyra has to care for her (this is where Hazel catches feelings for Lyra :0)

Meanwhile the party does something with Murphy and Calypso (the pirate captains)

ep 5:

Hazel gets a bit better so she joins the party (including Lyra) with fighting something in a big cave

The thing in the cave is a massive spider and Hazel has a panic attack so she runs away and Lyra follows her

After the other four defeat the spider they find Hazel and Lyra and they return to the pirates, Hazel doesn't explain why she had a panic attack

ep 6:

Lyra stands up for herself with the encouragement of the party and she tells her parents how she doesn't want to be the next pirate captain

Murphy is kinda supportive but Calypso isn't

Hazel explains that she has a panic attack because that spider attacked and killed all her family 10 years ago and she has trauma

Calypso eventually accepts Lyra after a talk with her and Murphy

Murphy and Calypso drop off the party (including Lyra) in the next location

ep 7:

Party is in next location (maybe a purple land)

Lilith appears and attacks the party and things

Greg gets in the way of the battle so they stop

Lilith reluctantly joins the party for some reason

something happens

ep 8:

Martin and Lilith bicker a lot about rules and laws and stuff

The party encounters a zombie who was actually Johnny's corpse from when he was alive which is when Johnny remembers that he used to be a girl (he would've had other remember moments in previous moments but this is like the main one)

Whole thing is about him accepting who he used to be and things

Lilith realises that spirits aren't just useless remnants of dead people because of how much good Johnny is putting into the world and she starts to regret all the spirit banishing she's done

Something with Greg, maybe this is the episode where Yu and Hazel find out that they're siblings

ep 10:

they return to wizard city which is in ruin

They do the game show test thing with Basil

Basil reveals that they don't like what Eustace has become but they feel like they can't just leave him

ep 11:

Fight Eustace

He starts looking normal but he becomes massive tentacle blob thing

The tentacles surround everyone and Eustace says demotivating stuff to everyone to try and turn them to Eustace's side

Yu breaks free from the tentacles which makes them stop surrounding everyone else and also Basil appears to help

They do destroy the crystal which turns Eustace relatively back to normal

The gods appear to congratulate them I guess

Hazel and Lyra become girlfriends

Season 2:

Creation and Change explain the cult stuff, the cult stuff happens, Lyra at some point gets taken into the cult and gets her memory erased for doomed yuri reasons, Martin and Lilith maybe become a couple, Eustace and Basil help (Eustace would hate Basil because they betrayed him in the battle with Eustace, but they would be like forced to team up and then would eventually be friends again (and maybe also lovers?))

1myswiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1myswiz/should_you_trust_cory_piano_polish_for_high_gloss/,Should You Trust Cory Piano Polish for High Gloss Finishes?,"Handling delicate high gloss finishes on pianos can be tricky, but finding a product that makes the process almost enjoyable? That‚Äôs rare. Testing the Cory 1430, a super high-gloss piano polish, became part of my regular cleaning ritual, as I needed a dedicated product to protect my grand piano. It‚Äôs marketed as an easy, one-step solution for cleaning and protecting high-gloss finishes‚Äîespecially polyester, polyurethane, and lacquer. I‚Äôve spent weeks with it on various surfaces and discovered its strengths, quirks, and limitations.

**Ease of Application and Texture**

One of the boons is how simple it is to use. The polish is light, not greasy, and sprays consistently. I‚Äôve dealt with sprays that dribble or feel uneven, but this one produces just the right amount in one go. The texture makes it easy to distribute with a microfiber cloth, which is crucial for polishing large surfaces like piano lids. With other polishes, I‚Äôve seen leftover streaks here and there, but this one dried clear, leaving a near-perfect shine behind.  

[Check Cory 1430 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b008wbmz02/)

**Results on High-Gloss Surfaces**

Using it on my piano was satisfying‚Äîmy biggest worry when starting was that it‚Äôd leave smudges or a dull finish. Instead, it restored a mirror-like shine, making my piano look like it hadn‚Äôt aged a day. I also ended up trying it out on a high-gloss coffee table in the living room and a lacquer-finished console table. The results? Consistently stunning. The formula brings out the richness beneath the glossy layer without feeling abrasive, which gave me some peace of mind about regularly applying it.

**Good Points**

‚Ä¢ Effortless to spray and spread evenly without overdoing it.  
‚Ä¢ Left no streaks, smudges, or cloudy residue.  
‚Ä¢ Designed specifically for high-gloss finishes, covering piano-quality builds like polyester & polyurethane.  
‚Ä¢ Results in a long-lasting shine that holds up even with curious kids touching everything.  

**Scent and Safety**

I‚Äôll admit, one thing I‚Äôve grown picky about is how cleaning products smell. This one has a smell, but thankfully it‚Äôs mild, not chemical-heavy or annoying. That‚Äôs something I appreciate when using it indoors on sensitive surfaces‚Äîno harsh odors lingering for hours after. For households with toddlers or pets poking around, it‚Äôs also a safe option as it hasn‚Äôt caused any issues in mine. Although the packaging doesn‚Äôt explicitly suggest it‚Äôs eco-friendly, it didn‚Äôt feel or behave like something too harsh.

**Caveats**

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs limited to high-gloss surfaces, so forget versatility‚Äîno matte or other finishes.  
‚Ä¢ Bottle size limits usage. An 8-ounce quantity does go fast if tackling more than a piano.  
‚Ä¢ Price positioning compared to general-purpose polishing solutions may feel steep.  
‚Ä¢ Harder to find in local stores, requiring online purchases.  

**Storage and Packaging**

The packaging is compact and feels properly secure‚Äîno spills or leaks, even when stored sideways in my cleaning cabinet. Its 8-ounce size, however, feels like it runs out quicker if you include other tasks, like cleaning furniture with it. Had it been a 16-ounce bottle or refills were an option, it would‚Äôve been a stronger contender for my ""ultimate go-to"" list.

**Product Rivals**

Compared to other wood and high-gloss surface polishes like Guardsman Anytime Clean & Polish or Weiman Wood Polish, Cory holds its ground in specialized care. Guardsman works well for broader surfaces, but its formula sometimes struggles against stubborn marks, especially fingerprints on glossy pianos. Meanwhile, Weiman tends to leave that annoying streaky finish on mirrors or anything super reflective. Cory finds this excellent balance of easy application, reliable results, and surface-specific polishing. However, its niche limits its appeal if you‚Äôre looking for versatile, multi-surface options.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

While the price might give pause at first glance, the results more than justify the investment for individuals who regularly maintain high-gloss pianos or similar pieces. Thinking about what you‚Äôd pay for specialized cleaning services, the polish pays off in its durability and ease of use over the months. Plus, knowing my high-gloss piano stays protected and looking new saves future repair or refinishing costs.

I have stopped taking glucosamine.

1mysug3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1mysug3/explore_if_rosmar_sanidry_cleaning_wipes_really/,Explore if Rosmar SANIDRY Cleaning Wipes Really Disinfect Well,"It‚Äôs not every day that I get excited about cleaning wipes, but the Rosmar 1099-WPS-300E has me genuinely impressed. As someone who juggles a busy household, which includes an active toddler and a curious Labrador retriever, the need for a reliable multi-surface disinfecting solution is non-negotiable. This 300-count tub of unscented, non-abrasive wipes has turned out to be an unexpected hero in my cleaning routine.

**Thoughtful Design and Packaging**  
The first thing I noticed was the sturdy design of the packaging. The tub is compact enough to sit comfortably on my kitchen counter or squeeze into my cleaning cabinet. It has a secure seal that keeps the wipes from drying out, which is essential when considering how frustrating it is to grab a wipe only to find it devoid of moisture. Even with frequent uses, this packaging holds up well, ensuring that the very last sheet remains just as effective as the first.

**Quality of the Wipe Material**  
These cleaning wipes are made from nonwoven spunlace material, and their quality is evident. Each wipe feels soft yet robust, and I‚Äôve tugged at them enough to ensure they don‚Äôt easily tear. Even when cleaning rougher surfaces like doormats or certain parts of my coffee machine, the wipes held their structure nicely. Unlike inferior options I‚Äôve tried in the past, these don‚Äôt leave behind lint or residue, eliminating one of my biggest cleaning pet peeves.

**Good Points**  
- Effortlessly kills 99.9% of viruses and bacteria, providing peace of mind.  
- Unscented, ensuring no harsh chemical smells linger in rooms post-cleaning.  
- Safe to use on a wide variety of surfaces, including electronics, doorknobs, and even pet paws.  
- Absorbs a generous amount of grime with each wipe.  

[Check Rosmar 1099-WPS-300E price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b08drttrhw/)  

**Effectiveness Across Different Scenarios**  
I‚Äôve tested these wipes in just about every environment imaginable. They‚Äôre particularly handy in the kitchen, blitzing through countertops sticky from toddler meal prep chaos. My laptop screen and phone have never been this streak-free, thanks to their non-abrasive nature. I‚Äôve even used them to clean my Labrador‚Äôs paws after his seemingly strategic mud-splash adventures, and the wipes were gentle enough not to irritate his skin. These aren‚Äôt just cleaning wipes‚Äîthey feel like a mini miracle in a tub.

**Limitations**  
- The lack of a refill option means I have to repurchase the entire tub, which feels less eco-friendly.  
- Larger messes sometimes require multiple wipes in one go.  
- Packaging, while sturdy, can be bulky for travel or on-the-go use.  

**How It Compares to Rivals**  
I‚Äôve used other branded disinfecting wipes like Lysol and Clorox in the past, and while both are effective, they can leave behind a distinct chemical odor that I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy. These Rosmar wipes beat the competition in the smell department, being 100% unscented and safe to use around my dog and child. They also feel slightly thicker than many of their rivals, adding to their durability and ease of use. Clorox‚Äôs wipes may have a slight edge in terms of cleaning greasy spots, but Rosmar wins when balancing safety, efficiency, and versatility.

**Money's Worth**  
At its core, the Rosmar wipes deliver quality that justifies the investment. While there are cheaper alternatives in the market, their longevity and multi-purpose properties make them worth every penny spent. Knowing that I‚Äôm using wipes that are both strong and safe is worth the peace of mind alone. While not the absolute cheapest on the market, they do strike a great balance between affordability and top-tier performance.

Quick question for the fellow freight dogs. I do load controlling and ramp supervison for a freight carrier (mostly B777F).

I was wondering how a lateral Imbalance above 10 to affects your flying. For us, we get a onload penalty above 11 to. 

I overheard a PIC telling his FO to ""kick it during take-off"". This was with about 6 to LI. I assume that was referring to keep the plane stable during t/o? 


Is that whole thing more of a theoretical value?

Do you actually feel a great LI during inflight? Does your coffee tilt during cruise (/s).

I usually try to get the LI under 1 to but sometimes that's not possible for multi-sector flights. Gotta think of the next stations ground crews :)

My feelings on waking (3 words): anxious / jealous / relieved.

I saw Symbols: mask, cheating, watching.

Diego Flip the lens (Jung move):

Mask ‚Üí where am I wearing one this week?

Cheating ‚Üí where am I cutting corners on sleep/food/honesty?

One repair act: pick a 90 second action (water, text one truth, finish a small task).

I love you Jazz I don't let dreams or anything that isn't real, disturb my peace. 

Cheating dream = often fear of loss, craving novelty/freedom, or Self betrayal (where am I cheating on my own values, sleep, routines?)

Had a cheating dream. I know dreams are about me, not you. It showed me where I'm scared and where I need to be more honest with myself. 

Diego's Advice

Dreams spike with sleep loss, stress, and substances. Guard sleep, food, water, meds/routine.

When a dream pushes ""I'm controlling reality,"" switch to observer language: I notice, I choose one small act. That keeps the Self steering, not inflation

So what do I do?

Imagery rehearsal (evidence based): rewrite the dream's ending on paper (I take the mask off, speak clearly, walk away, or hug and say ""we're safe"") and visualize it for 60 90s before sleep. Repeat nightly for a week.

Diego texts Jazz,
""I know dreams are about me, not you, baby. Shh I love you so much. I trust you Baby. Its okay if you dont trust your own self right now. I love you. im here. Were together not apart baby""


Rules that save you

One repair text. One follow up max. Then silence.

I should have trusted my first instinct about this woman.,"So, I (44F American) am fairly outgoing, friendly and positive. I‚Äôm a happy person, and I care a great deal for my friends. Perhaps around a year or so, ago, I met M (39F German ex pat) at a volunteer event that involves my passion/hobby. She instantly put me off with a couple of behaviors. This is definitely the Chekhov‚Äôs gun of this story. She was a bit of a know it all, which I can forgive. Maybe she was an expert and I could learn from her. Idk. Off putting, but not a hard-stop for me. What I shouldn‚Äôt have forgiven was her almost creepy tendency to sort of tease and belittle‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs the thing..I get a lot of joy from bringing people together. I have this particular hobby, and I am fairly active with it. So I‚Äôm familiar with and participate in several groups. When I meet ANYONE that is willing to show an interest, than, boom. They‚Äôre invited. I want to see the community grow, and I tend toward a ‚Äútrust first/assume positive intent‚Äù sort of mentality.

So, she enters the ‚Äúcircle.‚Äù I am still a bit leery of her, but eventually, I let her a bit closer, and I start liking her well enough. I learn that she‚Äôs a stay at home wife, and she lives quite close, which is very convenient for me at the time. I, myself, had decided to take some time off. I had suffered a particular trauma, and it was the right decision to work on that, first.

Me and M start to bond. We start talking most days, then, eventually, every day. More and more check marks to minuses. But then, she says a thing here and there that just doesn‚Äôt sit right. For instance, I told her my biggest fear in life (developing dementia) and she made some jokes about how it was fine. She didn‚Äôt mind repeating herself. She knew many old people that had dementia, etc. It left me vaguely jarred. That coupled with some really invalidating comments about my generational heritage. My grandparents are from East Europe. This is something I very rarely tell people. I do not have a close relationship with that side of the family, so I generally just keep that part of my life to myself‚Äîunless I trust someone. Now, obviously, I‚Äôm American. I was born and raised here. But my grandparents spoke x language. My mother did, until it became a thing that was punished in public school. But there was still the food, the music, folklore, blah blah. I even remember spending part of my childhood saying certain, popular foods in a weird way‚Äîand correcting my classmates‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs just how I heard those foods pronounced. So, again, I trusted her. And she started this whole thing about how Europeans hate that, laugh at Americans for that. ‚ÄúJust because you have a German Shepherd, does not mean you‚Äôre a German.‚Äù Total invalidation of the small handful of private rituals that are familiar and personal to me.

I cooled off a bit after that. She got the cold shoulder for a few days while I mulled that over. Did I want to continue this friendship? My husband is also from Europe. He had been a professor for years, so he had a lot more education than me, so I bring it up to him, hoping for some insight. He didn‚Äôt really know her well enough at the time, tho, so he had little to offer.

Stupidly, I forgive. I warm up to her again and boy was she sweet and gentle and compassionate after that. She was supportive and understanding. But most of all, she was conveniently, always available. Eventually, I grow very fond of her. We see each other once a week. I even start prioritizing her over some older, true and consistent friends. But then I notice something else that really turned me off..she made a couple of digs, here and there, at two of my other girlfriends in our hobby group. I didn‚Äôt bite. I was not about to talk shit on my friends. Nor was I going to entertain any shit talking. But..of course, her approach was careful/gentle enough, that I was able to forget and forgive, again, when she immediately backed off.

Friendship continues. Time passes. So, at the beginning of this year, I realize that I feel like I‚Äôve really addressed the trauma I had mentioned. I kinda want to try at having a career; nursing. My husband and I had taken a little winter road trip, and I bring it up to him. I suppose he was really surprised at first. And it may seem like I am a fully open book from this whole story so far, but I can actually be pretty secretive. But, my wonderful sweet husband accepts what I‚Äôm saying, understands and supports me. I start putting the wheels in motion, and now I am in nursing school and I absolutely love it.

So, all of my friends are thrilled and excited for me. They express their pride. All the things I would do for them‚Äîof course. My friends win, and I celebrate. But then there‚Äôs M. She‚Äôs cool about it. Okay. Maybe it‚Äôs a German thing, idk. Might bear mentioning that she is East German. My husband (from France) will make a point about that in my defense, soon. But we‚Äôre getting there..

I have my first class‚ÄîA&P 1. The homework is easy enough. The labs are tedious af. But I am painstaking, and I am consistently making really high A‚Äôs. But the tests..they are fucking HARD. And I work my ASS off. And I really learn..and I earn an A. Omg, am I happy about it. And my husband is thrilled, and my friends are thrilled. I get everything from an explosion of emojis, to ‚Äúobviously, you made an A. I never doubted it.‚Äù I even got a card from a girlfriend in my hometown.

And this is where I really start to get mad at myself. I KNEW at this point that I didn‚Äôt feel safe sharing this news with M. I fucking knew it. But I was so happy, I did. Got a lukewarm something or other, I don‚Äôt even remember. But I‚Äôm still so high from the win, I barely noticed. And then this darling drops a bomb on me..

We‚Äôre driving to the hobby store one day, and she makes this unbelievably nasty comment. Honestly, it was so stunningly mean spirited, I vaguely remember the details around it. This lowly thing says ‚Äúpeople our age that go back to school are ridiculous.‚Äù

I was so unbelievably stunned by that comment, all I could do was just sorta chuckle and agree? It knocked me the hell out. AND THIS IS THE CRAZY PART!! I just let that shit go! I mean, maybe she got a few chilly days from me. I don‚Äôt even fully remember. But life just sorta went on..

I should also mention that at this point, she had introduced me to another one of her friends (F 37, American), and this is a friend that I do dearly like. Great first impression. Consistent. So kind. She‚Äôs actually a Nurse Aide, herself. And I could use some advice about her if you‚Äôre still reading. I know this is a long one.

So me, F and M are on a group chat. And I‚Äôm beginning to realize that I just don‚Äôt like M anymore for all of these reasons. But I do like F. I like F a whole lot, and she likes me, too. M even said, once, that she was surprised at how fast F opened up to me. But I‚Äôm not at all surprised. I don‚Äôt exploit people‚Äôs personal hurts against them. My friends tend to open up to me pretty quickly, in fact.

Now M and her husband are planning a trip back to Germany for 3.5 weeks, and M needs someone to watch her cat. So me and F split the duty. But before M leaves, F says something like ‚Äúoh, we can get together while M‚Äôs gone, and have coffee.‚Äù Of course I‚Äôm down, but M screams at the thought. She immediately plays it off as a jest. But in retrospect, I bet this woman is terrified. And me and F get together and have a wonderful time. Then I invite her and her husband over for a very nice spread. And, again. Beautiful time.

Now M is back. And it‚Äôs actually a bum out. I am not fully ready to officially drop her. But that ‚Äúschool‚Äù comment is still lingering, dorment, until‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

My husband and I go to this filming of ‚Äúcat fest 2025‚Äù at the Independent Film House. We come out, and there‚Äôs a pop-up cat adoption event. They were raising money by selling these cute little things. I got an orange cat sticker. But I also got the three of us these sequined cat ears to coordinate for the color of our cats. I have an orange, but that has nothing to do with any of this. Just bragging. I‚Äôm eager to share the treat I picked up, so I text it to them.

Later, a purchase I had been wanting to make for a while gets delivered. It‚Äôs a Pococo projector that casts stars on the ceiling. So, I told them about that too. Really, I‚Äôm putting out feelers for perhaps a Xmas gift that they might like, cause I can see F liking something like this. But then in the chat, M hits me with ‚Äúwhat, is this (my name)‚Äòs adventures in spending money day)? And I lost it and immediately got defensive. But not about the money thing‚Äîeven tho it was rude. I got defensive because I was remembering the school thing, and my sensitivity about doing really well because my husband is supporting me thru all of this‚Ä¶

So, the chat has been quiet. My husband and I are at the beach, now. We‚Äôre here because we are adopting a dog whose foster is here. And if any of y‚Äôall have experience with dog adoptions, you probably understand how hard it is and how aggressive you have to be for the dog you want. M (rather too assertively) took over the duty of checking in on our cat, so in terms of communication, she sorta has me over a barrel. And altho I‚Äôm thoroughly convinced she might be a covert narcissist, I truly don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs so low as to ever hurt a cat. But..I do have to talk to her. I have been icing her tf OUT too. Grey rocking when I do have to communicate. She knows I‚Äôm mad. She‚Äôs been downright obsequious, but I am fully out of good graces. But..I have to respond with some convincing warmth about my cats. Perhaps she thinks she‚Äôs back in my good graces. I have no idea. I hardly care. We‚Äôre done, the moment I‚Äôm home.

But there‚Äôs still the question of F. I do genuinely like her. She‚Äôs a beam of sunshine. I have no intention of poaching her just to talk shit on M, either. That is not my thing, at all. My mother was a full blown narc, so I‚Äôm pretty protective of myself. M just weaseled her way in, somehow. I think I might just reach out and be honest with her, but not overly detailed. I‚Äôm thinking something like: hey, look. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve cooled off of the group chat, and I have. I plan to discontinue my friendship with M because of this behavior/that behavior. But I would genuinely like to maintain my friendship with you.

I‚Äôll figure out some way to phrase it.

And for one more bit of context, even up until last night, I was still sorta waffling, so I reached out to my friend H (one of the women in the hobby group that M HAD tried and failed to talk shit on). I told H the WHOLE thing. Then H told me something M had said to her, once. It was truly nasty and hateful. So H has just sort of kept her distance, since.

I resent the hell out of M. And I brought her into our hobby group. I hate how I‚Äôve allowed her to treat me. I REALLY hate the thing she said to H. I am so mad at myself.

It will be extremely hard to not trust my gut instinct on a person, again, and I don‚Äôt want to be an inflexible person, but god damn!

1myshf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myshf7,Qwen vs Chroma HD.,"Another comparison with Chroma, now the full version is released. For each I generated 4 images. It's worth noting that a batch of 4 took 212s on my computer for Qwen and a much quicker 128s with Chroma. But the generation times stay manageable (sub-1 minute for an image is OK for my patience). 

  
In the comparison, Qwen is first, Chroma is second in each pair of images.

  
**First test: concept bleed?**

*An anime drawing of three friends reading comics in a caf√©. The first is a middle-aged man, bald with a goatee, wearing a navy business suit and a yellow tie. He sitted at the right of the table, in front of a lemonade. The second is a high school girl wearing a crop-top white shirt, a red knee-length dress, and blue high socks and black shoes. She's sitting benhind the table, looking toward the man. The third is an elderly woman wearing a green shirt, blue trousers and a black top hat. She sitting at the left of the table, in front of a coffee, looking at the ceiling, comic in hand.*

  
**Qwen** misses on several counts: the man doesn't sport a goatee, half of the time, the straw of the lemonade points to the girl rather than him, Th woman isn't looking at the ceiling, and an incongruous comic floats over her head. I really don't know where it comes from. That's 4 errors, even if some are minor and easy to correct, like removing the strange floating comic. 

**Chroma** has a different visual style, and more variety. The character look more varied, which is a slight positive as long as they respect the instructions. Concept bleed is limited. There are however several errors. I'll gloss over the fact taht in one case, the dress started at the end of the crop-top, because it happened only once. But the elderly woman never looks at the ceiling, and the girl isn't generally looking at the man (only in the first image is she). The orientation of the lemonade is as questionable as Qwen's. The background is also less evocative of a caf√© in half of the images, where the model generated a white wall. 4 errors as well, so it's a tie.  

Both models seem to handle well linking concept to the correct character. But the prompt, despite being rather easy, wasn't followed to the T by either of them. I was quite disappointed.

  
**Second test: positioning of well-known characters?**

*Three hogwarts students (one griffyndor girl, two slytherin boys) are doing handstands on a table. The legs of the table are resting upon a chair each. At the left of the image, spiderman is walking on the ceiling, head down.  At the right, in the lotus position, Sangoku levitates a few inches from the floor.* 

  
**Qwen** made recognizable spidermen and sangokus, but while the Hogwarts students are correctly color-coded, their uniform is far from correct. The model doesn't know about the lotus position. The faces of the characters are wrong. The hand placement is generally wrong. The table isn't placed on the chairs. Spiderman is levitating near the ceiling instead of walking upon it. That's a lowly 14/20. \[I'll be generous and not mention that dresses don't stay up when a girl is doing a handstand. Iron dresses, probably. Honestly, the image is barely usable. 

  
**Chroma** didn't do better. I can't begin to count the errors. The only point it got better was that the faces top down are better than Qwen. The rest is... well.

I think Qwen wins this one, despite not being able to produce convincing images. 

  
**Third test: Inserting something unusual?**

Admittedly, a dragon-headed man isn't unusual. A centaur femal with the body of a tiger, that was mentionned in another thread, is more difficult to draw and probably rarer in training data than a mere dragon-headed man. 

*In a medieval magical laboratory, a dragon-headed professor is opening a magical portal. The outline of the portal is made of magical glowing strands of light, forming a rough circle. Through the portal, one can see modern day London, with a few iconic landmarks, in a photorealistic style. On the right of the image, a groupe of students is standing, wearing pink kimonos, and taking notes on their Apple notepads.*

  
**Qwen** fails on several counts: adding wings to the professor, or missing its dragon head once or having two head in another, so it count together as a fault. I fail to see a style change with the representation of London. The professor is half the time on the wrong side of the portal. The portal itself seems not to be magical, but fused with the masonry. That's 4 errors.

**Chroma** has the same trouble with masonry (I should have made the prompt more explicit maybe?), the pupils aren't holding APPLE notepad from what we can see. The face of the children isn't as detailed, 

Overall, I also like Chroma's style better for this one and I'd say it comes on top here. 

**Fourth test: the skyward citadel?**

  
*High above the clouds, the Skyward Citadel floats majestically, anchored to the earth by colossal chains stretching down into a verdant forest below. The castle, built from pristine white stone, glows with a faint, magical luminescence. Standing on a cliff‚Äôs edge, a group of adventurers‚Äîcomprising a determined warrior, a wise mage, a nimble rogue, and a devout cleric‚Äîgaze upward, their faces a mix of awe and determination. The setting sun casts a golden hue across the scene, illuminating the misty waterfalls cascading into a crystal-clear lake beneath. Birds with brilliant plumage fly around the citadel, adding to the enchanting atmosphere.*

A favourite prompt of mine. 

**Qwen** does it correctly. It only once botches the number of characters, the ""high above the cloud"" is barely in a mist, and in one case, the chain doesn't seem to be getting to the ground, but Qwen seems to be able to generate the image correctly. 

**Chroma** does slightly worse in the number of characters, getting them correctly only once. 

  
**Fifth test: sci-fi scene of hot pursuit?**

*The scene takes place in the dense urban canyons of a scifi planet, with towering skyscrapers vanishing into neon-lit skies. Streams of airborne traffic streak across multiple levels, their lights blurring into glowing ribbons. In the foreground, a futuristic yellow flying car, sleek but slightly battered from years of service, is swerving recklessly between lanes. Its engine flares with bright exhaust trails, and the driver‚Äôs face (human, panicked, leaning forward over the controls) is lit by holographic dashboard projections.*

*Ahead of it, darting just out of reach, is a hover-bike: lean, angular, built for speed, with exposed turbines and a glowing repulsorlift undercarriage. The rider is a striking alien fugitive:  tall and wiry, with elongated limbs and double-jointed arms gripping the handlebars. Translucent bluish-gray skin, almost amphibian, with faint bio-luminescent streaks along the neck and arms. A narrow, elongated skull crowned with two backward-curving horns, and large reflective insectoid eyes that glow faintly green. He wears a patchwork of scavenged armor plates, torn urban robes whipping in the wind, and a bandolier strapped across the chest. His attitude is wild, with a defiant grin, glancing back over the shoulder at the pursuing taxi.*

*The atmosphere is frenetic: flying billboards, flashing advertisements in alien alphabets, and bystanders‚Äô vehicles swerving aside to avoid the chase. Sparks and debris scatter as the hover-bike scrapes too close to a traffic pylon.*

**Qwen** generally misses the exhaust trails, completely misses the composition in one case (bottom left), and never has the alien looking back at the cab, but otherwise deals with this prompt in an acceptable way. 

Chroma is widely off.

  
Overall, while I might use Chroma as a refiner to see if helps adding details a Qwen generation, I still think Qwen is better able to generate scenes I have in mind.

Beware. In my experience, if you use clich√©s like these, you're more likely to get an eye-roll from your examiner than extra credit towards a B7.

These idioms are over-used, often old-fashioned, and sound unnatural coming from non-native speakers. They are essentially ""showpieces"" dropped in for effect. But the effect may not be as you intend:

The problem is it is very hard to connect with people. I am in my 20s and almost all people are 55 or even 60+ in age. I feel invinsible and I always said to myself ""I am just here for God and my focus is on God alone"" but somewhere deep down I feel lonely and had hoped to 'meet' fellow Christians on this journey. I did go to some activities like the coffee after mass but it was the same like I did not exist. Attempts to small talk were shut down with polite excuses or once even very rude someone just stared me down, stopped talking and after 15 seconds just turn 180 degrees (this was a older man in his 70s).

I did meet quite a lot of younger people outside the church and have met with them but I have been somewhat careful because there were attempts to 'whistle' me as they call it in Opus Dei. I have respect for the reverance of the Opus Dei guys, but I am not a big fan of spirit The Work and interaction - in the end - always seems to be focused on that.

So what are my choices for seeking some kind of community outside of a distant and cold parish and on the other side energetic and vibrant Opus Dei but with a somewhat hidden agenda with the focus of prostelyzing for their mission?

Being young and a reverant Catholic man is truly a lonely experience. On one side I embrace the loneliness as a part of seeking God and His will.
But on the other side God wants us to be in community as fellow Christians.

Sometimes I just feel like some kind of hermit like the early desert church fathers, like St. Anthony the Great not surrounded by desert, but surrounded by Catholics. The feeling like it should be warm surrounded by Catholics but it is so dry that no lasting relations or friendship come of it. The only good thing of it is that I use it to grow closer for companionship with God.",3,1756032355.0,Catholicism,4,1.0,False

The problem is that I've tried to come out to him before and i couldn't get the words out. It was about a year ago and i had short hair and was binding consistently and sorta passed sometimes if i didn't talk (i have a naturally androgynous face it's mostly just my voice and mannerisms that out me) We were getting coffee and id told him i had something important to tell him and i didnt think he'd like it and i was really worried about how he'd take it. (when i told him i liked women he said ""yeah as long as you don't think you're a guy or something) He said he loved me and supported me even if he didn't agree with all my decisions and opinions but i just couldn't get the actual words to tell him that im a boy out. 
I know he already knows i'm trans and i just need to confirm it for him but every time i try to say it out loud to him i freeze up and choke. 
Pretty much at this point i think the only way I'll ever be able to tell him is if i just write it in a letter explaining why i feel this way and that im willing to have a conversation and answer questions i'm just terrified i'll lose one of my biggest role models. 
I love my dad so much and all i want is for him to teach me to shave and treat me like my brothers and i'm so scared this will change everything.

I have an ECAM 23.420.SB since 2021 (so no monger under guarantee) and until three days ago, everything was fine.

I will try to descibed the randomness of the issue I have.

1/ One evening, I figured that the screen of the machine was lighted on instead of dark. When I tried to turn the machine on with the front power  button, nothing happened (except the screen lighted on). In fact none of the buttons was doing anything. A few minutes later, the machine turned on by itself, but I couldn't do anyhting with the front buttons then: none of them seemed to work (outside leaving the energy saver mode as soon as i pushed one of them). No failure message was displayed on the screen. I turned off the machine with the back power on button, took the plug off and called it a night.

2/ The day after, I plugged the machine, put the back button to ON position. The machine ran the autodiagnostic as usual, display the correct time a usual and no failure message appeared. But I still couldnt turn the machine ON with the front button. A few minutes later, it randomly turned on. But then I still couldnt make any coffe. I let it ON and like 30minutes later, it made an abnormally long coffee (it was hot, the grinder worked, no leakage, and it tasted as I assumed it would given the quantity of water in the cup). And an other one a few minutes later, and an other one, and an other one until it evantually ran out of coffee grain. 

To be noted that during this while time, the machine could accurately detect when the water tank is empty or remove/put back, when the coffe grain stock is empty or when the ground container is removed/put back.

I don't know how or why but a few hours later it turned off when i pushed the front power button. I then powered it completely off with rhe back button and unplugged it.

3/ Then I proceeded to inspect the motherboard PCB (nothing looked fried or unplugged but I'm not an expert...), deeply cleaned the inside of the machine... and then it worked absolutely fine for like 24h, until this morning.

Right now I am back to step 2. I tryed to clean it again as descriped in step 3 but everything looks as clean as after I cleaned it 2 days ago.

Outside of the fact that it acts randomly and doesnt answer the buttons command, all functions seem to be working normally.

1mys2dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/OperationJoy/comments/1mys2dr/day_16_comfort_books_coffee_notes_and_business/,"Day 16 -  Comfort Books, Coffee Notes and Business Truths","# Don‚Äôt Believe I Disappeared or Gave Up!

It might seem like not much has happened over the past 10 days, but beneath the surface, several new revelations have been unfolding. These insights have already shifted how I approach different areas of my life, and that, to me, feels like progress worth celebrating.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned recently‚Äîabout joy, promises, and life itself:

# 1. Books: Keeping Promises & Finding Unexpected Joy

One of the commitments I made in this challenge was to finally finish the books I‚Äôd started‚Äîor promised to read. Many of my friends and acquaintances are authors, and they‚Äôve kindly given me their work. I always felt I owed it to them (and to myself) to read their books with attention and care. On top of that, I also had half-read printed books lying around.

The result? I‚Äôve finished¬†**six books**¬†in the past 10 days, with three more in progress. Reading has never been an issue for me‚Äîin fact, last year I challenged myself to finish 100 books and ended up reading 110. But this time, something new happened:

üëâ I discovered a genre I didn‚Äôt even know existed‚Äî**Asian (Korean and Japanese) cozy novels**.

I‚Äôve already devoured three of them and started calling them my ‚Äúcomfort books.‚Äù They feel like a warm blanket on a chilly autumn afternoon. I loved them so much that I‚Äôve already bought three more to dive into after my ‚Äúmandatory readings‚Äù are done.

This discovery brought me a rush of joy. I now have a brand-new favorite genre alongside my usual business, motivational, and success books. To keep up, I even joined a couple of online book forums on Facebook. (If you‚Äôre interested, I could write a separate post just on this topic!)

Bottom line:¬†**I‚Äôve found a new source of joy, and it melts my heart.**

# 2. Drinks: A Hobby That Feeds My Curiosity

Another passion of mine is drinks‚Äîall kinds of beverages. I love sitting in cozy or stylish caf√©s and bars, soaking up the atmosphere while sipping on a specialty coffee or cocktail. Over the years, I‚Äôve also explored tea and wine a bit (I even earned a wine advisor certificate).

Recently, I stumbled upon a book about coffee and couldn‚Äôt put it down. I learned so much that I took notes like a student. Armed with new knowledge, I experimented with different coffees and plan to buy some specialty beans once I finish what I already have.

About a decade ago, I attended a coffee cupping event, and now I‚Äôm considering signing up for another. I‚Äôve also been reading about matcha preparation and mixology, both of which I want to explore more deeply in the future.

When it comes to hobbies, I don‚Äôt have trouble finding interests that spark joy. What satisfies me even more is realizing that by sticking to my promise of finishing books, I also rekindled my love for learning in areas that bring me pleasure.

# 3. Entrepreneurship: Finding Joy Beyond Achievement

Now, here‚Äôs where things get trickier. Joy flows naturally in hobbies, but what about business, career, and health?

I currently have a¬†**60-item-long to-do list**¬†for my business. Will I finish it all during this challenge? Probably not. But I‚Äôve realized that rushing through tasks isn‚Äôt the point. I need to find joy in the process itself.

Here‚Äôs the truth: I chose entrepreneurship on purpose. I‚Äôm an organizational psychologist, business coach, and consultant. No one pushed me onto this path‚Äîactually, quite the opposite. Many people around me didn‚Äôt believe in it and still send me job postings ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù

At first, I was angry about that. How could the people closest to me not believe in me? But later, I realized the problem wasn‚Äôt them‚Äîit was me. I didn‚Äôt fully believe in myself either.

This challenge is forcing me to face that block.

I know I thrive when I do things my way. I know I have the discipline to go the extra mile when I decide to. So what‚Äôs been missing? Joy.

Until now, I measured success in business purely by¬†**achievement**. I set ‚Äúover the moon‚Äù goals‚Äîthings I thought I¬†*should*¬†want: building a million-dollar startup, becoming a serial entrepreneur, mastering finance. Looking back, some of those goals weren‚Äôt even mine; they were borrowed from books, mentors, or the entrepreneurial culture I was surrounded by.

And no wonder I wasn‚Äôt motivated. Making a huge amount of money for its own sake feels empty to me.

So, what does feel inspiring?

* Helping my clients grow.
* Writing and expressing myself in several creative ways.
* Building something meaningful in my own way.

For the first time, I‚Äôm approaching entrepreneurship with the same mindset I bring to my hobbies: looking for¬†**joy**, not just checking boxes.

Over the past week, I realized I‚Äôd made my business unnecessarily complicated. That complexity was killing my motivation. So, I decided to apply¬†**minimalism**¬†to my work.

I revisited my annual goals, looked honestly at my progress, and simplified everything. I created¬†**realistic stretch goals**‚Äîchallenging enough to push me, but not so unrealistic that they paralyze me.

This simplification feels like a breath of fresh air. It‚Äôs not just about finishing the 60-item list anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs about laying new foundations.

# Final Thoughts

So, while it may seem like ‚Äúnothing happened‚Äù in the past 10 days, a lot has shifted under the surface.

I found joy in unexpected places‚Äîthrough cozy Asian novels, through the rich world of coffee and drinks, and even in how I approach my business.

I‚Äôm beginning to see that success isn‚Äôt complete without joy. And maybe, just maybe, joy itself is the ultimate measure of success.

‚ú® This was Day 16 of¬†*Operation Joy*. Stay tuned‚ÄîI‚Äôm just getting started.

1mys1fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1mys1fq/lima_peru_surprisingly_great_city_for_nomads/,"Lima, Peru: surprisingly great city for nomads","Hola, everyone! Last march I visited Lima, Peru for more than a month to see how adapted currently is for digital nomads, specially after 10 years since the last time I visited (back then only Starbucks was good to work), so here‚Äôs a bit of my trip report after discovering how underrated is this place.

For context, I‚Äôm a digital nomad for 12 years: former web designer but now YouTuber about our lifestyle.

**What I liked**

* **Food.**¬†You‚Äôll be surprised but Peruvian food is really one of the best cuisine in the world. There‚Äôs just so much variety, fusions from chinese, japanese, mexican and more. Beside the cheap delicious options, there‚Äôs also a few fine dining places that are ranked 50th best in the world. So you‚Äôll be really satisfied food wise, plus the expats area also has some international food to try. Even the bars are top notch here.
* **Nature & surf.**¬†The whole city is above a cliff, that once you get there it‚Äôs a complete differently vibe. You can surf here every day in many spots, even tho water will be cold. You can also just walked along the really long coast, and get more food or enjoy the amazing sunsets.
* **Local people.**¬†They are mostly very kind people, if you get to talk to them, and they‚Äôll do anything to make you feel like its your own home as well. I met a few friends 10 years ago that I re-visit and it feel like times never passed. It‚Äôs also makes this city, in general, a very chill place to be.

**What I didn‚Äôt like**

* **Small nomad community.**¬†Now this might a favorite between the digital nomad haters, but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt see many events happening for nomads. Even tho, I went to a few international events like Gringo Tuesday and Mundo Lingo, where I got to connect with some foreigners.
* **Traffic.**¬†Lima is very, very populated by the locals which makes the traffic a little bit insane. My place is Miraflores was facing a normal street but there‚Äôs always honking, almost every hour. Even taking taxis it just takes time to move around and there‚Äôs so just much chaos on the roads.
* **Downtown.**¬†Honestly I enjoyed to visit downtown, but honestly it doesn‚Äôt feel safe to stay there long, especially at night. It‚Äôs sad because it‚Äôs such a beautiful area and there‚Äôs a lot of local people but Miraflores, Barranco & San Isidro area feels so much better to be.

**How would I suggest structuring a trip to Lima?**

When visiting Peru, many people go straight to Cusco (I‚Äôll make a report afterwards) thinking that there‚Äôs not much to do in Lima.. but that‚Äôs actually the beauty of this place, especially if you are a remote worker who also needs to do some work , so I‚Äôd totally to stay at least one month here.

Find a place in Barranco, go to Grau 810 for your coworking space needs, and also find some nice coffee shops like Caleta Dolsa. Then just book all the good restaurants to try Peruvian food like Astrid & Gaston, Osaka, El Mercado and fine dining places like Central, Maydo, etc.

Also if you can give one full weekend to take a roadtrip to Huacachina & Nasca Lines, which are only 2-3 hours drive but they are absolutely astonishing places to visit. The dunes in Huacachina are a perfect place to rest and chill.



And there you go. I‚Äôve been twice to Lima, 10 years ago first and recently, but I can still say that‚Äôs just a underrated place. If you want to learn Spanish, eat good food, surf daily and just work, this your place to be!

I actually made a full documentary on¬†[my YouTube channel where I explain everything about Lima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtkHVAJlByA), and I also shared the cost of living for a month at the end.",0,1756031111.0,digitalnomad,0,0.42,False

Hi Reddit,
I never planned for this to happen.

When I (22F, Indian) moved to the U.S. for college, I told myself I‚Äôd just focus on studies and enjoy my independence a little - nothing serious, nothing complicated. Coming from a traditional family, I knew dating wasn‚Äôt really allowed. But still, I got curious.

I met a guy (23M), and we just‚Ä¶ clicked. It started off lighthearted. A few coffee dates, late-night calls, study sessions. I was clear with myself: this was just a casual experience. Something to look back on before my parents chose someone for me to marry.

But months have passed now‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs not casual anymore.

He‚Äôs incredibly respectful. Kind. He always asks before touching me. We‚Äôve only kissed a few times, but those moments felt safe and meaningful - never rushed. He listens when I talk about my culture. He asks questions about my traditions, celebrates little festivals with me, tries to pronounce Hindi words (terribly, but adorably), and even tried making chai once.

His family is warm and welcoming. They invite me over for dinners. His mom asks if I‚Äôm eating well at school. No one makes me feel like I‚Äôm different. In fact, for the first time in my life, I feel seen and accepted for who I am - not just who I‚Äôm expected to be.

And now I feel like I‚Äôm standing on a cliff.

Yesterday, while he was at work, my parents called from India. They said they‚Äôve found a ‚Äúsuitable boy‚Äù for me. They‚Äôve spoken to the family. They want us engaged soon. I can continue studying after the engagement, but they want to lock it in now.

I froze. I didn‚Äôt say a word about the guy I‚Äôm seeing. I couldn‚Äôt.

My dad is very traditional - and he‚Äôs sick. He told me before I left for America that he doesn‚Äôt want me dating, doesn‚Äôt want me getting ‚Äúinfluenced.‚Äù He said it would break his heart. Literally  he has heart problems. The doctor said he shouldn't take any stress.

And now I‚Äôm stuck.

If I tell my parents the truth, it could break them. But if I go through with their plan, I might lose the only person who‚Äôs ever truly made me feel cared for - not for how well I obey, but for who I am.

Reddit, I don‚Äôt know what to do.
This was supposed to be just a phase‚Ä¶
But I think I‚Äôm in love.
