1gbsu6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1gbsu6s/ive_lost_friends_because_of_my_bpd_wife/,I¬¥ve lost friends because of my BPD wife.,"First a disclaimer. Despite the title, I don¬¥t want for anyone to be blamed. I want to talk about my mistakes only here. All people I will mention are good people and their mistakes doesn¬¥t matter here.

I¬¥ve met my, now wife 4 years ago. And she was a typical BPD. I was a guy who go kicked out of school because I just gamed for days rather than studying. I solved sucking at life by more gaming.

BPD and a degen gamer, what a combo. I gamed with my friends. Hours every day. And BPD can¬¥t have that with her favourite person, right? So a lot of toxicity started coming up quite soon. Details are not important.

She was controling me, making me responsible for her problems, manipulating me etc. My friends saw all the red flags. They¬¥ve met IRL couple times and they basically started hating each other.

My wife wanted me to stop talking to them, they wanted me to break up with her. And I was trapped in the middle of it, with a bonus of running a family caf√© during Covid, when I couldn¬¥t pay myself a reasonable wage.

Few years go by and me and my wife are now doing really well. My wife worked so hard on herself and basically there is no BPD to speak of. We were able to solve all those red flags. We have great communication, I enjoy life with her, she supports me so much now. She is kind and patient, just an awesome human to be with. She mentiones to me from time to time I should contact my friends, even though she really doesn¬¥t like them.

And that is the problem. I, trapped in the middle of all that shit few years ago, I¬¥ve done the thing I can do best. Just disappeared. Stopped responding to them. Ghosted them. They reached out, I didn¬¥t respond. They tried again, we went for a coffee, I ghosted them again. That happened multiple times over the last few years. I just fucked them over again and again. I don¬¥t really know why. Last I talked to them probably like a year ago, but I am not really sure.

And even when we met, it was like remembering the good old days while knowing, that those are past. Like we all know it is over, just don¬¥t want to accept it.

The best thing for them would be to just leave me be. I just keep hurting them. They reach out, I tell them how everything is great and then ghost them two days later. I am really ashamed for that.

And few weeks ago, one of them, my BFF, whom I probably hurt the most, reached out to me again and I not that I didn¬¥t respond, I didn¬¥t even read the message. She is still a BFF to me. I love all those people so much, they stuck with me for so long and I can¬¥t even respond to a fucking message and I am sick and tired and disgusted by myself.

And few days ago, another friend just invited me to join them for a party celebrating her and her husbands new house. I fucking didn¬¥t open that either.

Four years of me screwing them over and they are still not done with me and are just kind to me.

I have a different life now. I am happy, I have a wife whom I love dearly and who is the best thing in my life. But they are still missing and I have to try to make things right with them. It would just be so much easier if they were at least angry with me...

And even if i start the contact with them again, what then? We were friends when we were together in school. After that we gamed together basically every day. That is easy to hold a connection with people you talk to everyday. We don¬¥t live far, so yeah, we can see each other from time to time, but I can¬¥t get back to gaming for hours everyday with them. I don¬¥t know whether they even do that... I spent 6 years worth of time of my 27 years of life gaming. 47000 hours. Don¬¥t get me wrong, I absolutely love it and I don¬¥t regret a single minute of it, but enough is enough.

I know this is not directly BPD related, but I know you guy and gals here, you are experts at blowing relationships into pieces and then trying to put them back. And this is one of the best communities I¬¥ve met on them internets.

EDIT: I am going for a walk to clear my head. I¬¥ll then open the messages, accept the invitation, say sorry and send them this post and ask them to read it, because what is the worst that can happen? I feel like shit anyway, can¬¥t be really that much worse and I don¬¥t talk to them now either, so...",1,1729858608.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

1gbstd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasting/comments/1gbstd4/rookie_looking_for_actual_good_tips_to_understand/,Rookie looking for actual good tips to understand podcasting,"Here's what to know about me: I'm a special needs mum. Got quite a following on socials. Got experience and skills on YouTube (with a very different topic, but still).

Here's why I want to start a podcast: because I love to listen to podcasts, but I hate the few that I found on special needs (I find them monotone, sad, not impactful). The only good one we had in Australia shut doors earlier this year. I got lots to say and lots of ideas. Good content (yeah, I'm biased...but it's good).

My rookie plan: record contextually video and audio, and post both YouTube video and podcast episode (yes, video! Remember, I'm good at YouTube, I could really have an ""unfair advantage""). If solo episode: around 15 minutes (some bonus episodes only 5-6 minutes). Interviews: 45 minutes. 10 episodes per year. 1 per month, and 2 months of review + plan next year of episodes.

Now, it's your turn:

1. Do you see something in my plan that is already NOT working?  
2. Which videos/articles or similar should I watch/read to educate myself on how to do podcasts? Possibly stuff that is good for dummies, I'm not as tech-savvy as you kiddos!  
3. Which resources should I NOT lose my time on (like ""hey, that YouTuber sells a terrible idea of podcasts! Don't listen to that!"")  
4. Money: well...gimme your best tips and/or resources to educate myself on how to monetise this new journey sooner rather than later, and (once I'll make money) I'll buy you a coffee!

1gbsn6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustodyForFathers/comments/1gbsn6c/co_parent_denying_any_contact/,Co parent denying any contact,"So she's refused to let me see him for almost 2 months now. I've filed for custody and am waiting on a court date. I filed for a guardian atlitum. She has said her ""legal council"" advised her not to allow any contact. When I pressed the issue, she said MAYBE a couple video calls. I kept pressing the issue saying it would be brought up in court and she offers a single 24 hour visit on a night I work, and only if we stay at my moms and I ""explicitly agree"" to everything she texted.

I think she's realized that she has screwed up, and is trying to scapegoat it by getting me to agree to lessened visitation. I think she's read somewhere that text is legally enforceable in VA. I think she doesn't have a lawyer of any kind. She wouldn't hire one then not file for custody, she wouldn't hire one in her county if she didn't file custody because it'd be a waste of money when I file here, and I highly doubt she got one in our home county especially not just to get legal advice with not filing custody papers. 

She filed a false EPO to have my first filing kicked out, immediately dissolved it as soon as we sat down in the court room telling the judge ""i thought it would give me custody, but i want my stuff back so i want to drop it"". She leans over to my mom on the way out the court room and says ""you didn't have to F-ing block me , you could have F-ing called him"". Her filing it prevents us from going to mediation AT ALL. So evidently she has no clue what an EPO does. 

I want to see my son, but I don't want to agree to her 24 hour terms. If I don't give him back she'll use it as a binding agreement. If I can't get an EPO or something to be legally able to keep him, it looks bad. If I manage to keep him I'm afraid it will look like I'm doing the same thing as her. 

She's had erratic behavior. One minute she's happy then next she's mad the next she's sad. She threw a steel coffee cup at me for asking her to not take our 13 month old 5 hours away and leave him in a hotel room with her mom's BF who's made sexual passes at her, so she can go party at a rap concert with her mom. She's disappeared every weekend of September. Cut contact for 2 days and calls from NC (no city named) after the concert. Cuts contact 2 more days and calls from myrtle beach SC. At this point a 9 hour drive. 

She comes back and her gums are green. She is up and down. Like one minute she cares about me the next she's yelling. It ends with Sept 29th she asks me to take her to an antique mall. I buy Starbucks, I buy her stuff at the mall, I buy her Chinese food, and her groceries. We get home and I say ""your pants are splitting in the back"" and she goes ballistic. ""Don't be checking me out"" blah blah blah. It ends with her saying she has no feelings and never will. That I need to stay single and focus on him. That she doesn't regret him but regrets me. I get to work and she argues from 8pm to almost 2am. Eventually saying she never had feelings for me the entire relationship. 

I go home at 6am, and wake up at 930 and she's gone. House is trashed, she threw her lock box across the room, left her birth certificate out. Won't answer the phone. Eventually answers for my mom. 

She tells her, ""we had a fight, I'm giving him some time to cool off"". She waits until Monday afternoon to file the EPO. Saying I said stuff like not wanting to be alive, not caring about him, that i cant feed him because hes breast fed, and that she's noticed a mental decline. The head of cps and our pediatrician said the milk thing is BS.

 At this point I saw him maybe 20 hours all September because I work 10 hour days then come home and clean up her trash food diapers and dirty clothes off the floor for 3 hours, 6 days a week. Then I cut fire wood for family on Sundays. She disappeared every weekend. Who isn't gonna feel sad when cut off from their kid???

It's been 26 days ZERO contact with him. I've seen him on video but they make no effort to get him to look at me. He's always fussy. IDK what to do. 

Hiring a lawyer but it's tough picking one. It feels like chess with a bad opponent but I could still mess up and give them the game... she doesn't want to work, said if she has to pay rent it's not feasible to live here. She wants to be treated like a teen at her mom's, no job, had the baby to them and go do what she wants. She's really paranoid. Like REALLY. Saying my family is out to get her trying to ruin her life. Saying she has never seen me take care of him and doesn't believe I can, I have taken parenting and co parent classes, active dad classes. I watched him alone for weeks at a time the first time we tried to have a custody battle. I feel like she's lost it, maybe not on drugs, but definitely not stable.

**April: Come She Will**

The wind stirred through the garden in the late morning, just as she woke up. She longed for touch when she awoke. Maybe a gentle caress on her forehead or her eyebrows, soft and slow. She opened her eyes, smiling as sunlight crept across her white dress, slowly inching toward her chin. Or perhaps, someone could have baked her a cake, her favorite or even theirs, to surprise her on her birthday. Or made her tea in bed, on mornings where she wanted to stay curled up.

‚ÄúTea?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I think I feel like coffee today‚Äù she answered.

Now, she knew she could do anything in the world. Like a bird freed from its golden cage, no longer a prisoner to anything or anyone. She liked to do things alone‚Äîreading by herself in the corner of her sofa, usually on a Sunday afternoon or evening, wrapped halfway in a blanket. Once in a while, she‚Äôd bring friends over, cooking or baking their favorite dishes, sharing stories from places far away. But when it was over, the house grew quieter than the night itself.

She dreamt of laughter, of conversations, of shared meals, drinks, arguments, and moments in bed‚Äîof things to share.

To pass time, she called her family, updating each other about their lives. But over time, she realized how busy everyone was, each lost in their own little worlds. It felt hopeless, but she kept trying, feeling it was necessary because they were always there when she felt lost. Sometimes, she‚Äôd send letters to distant friends, and their replies brought her comfort, reminding her she was still heard and remembered.

On the other part of the story, some time ago, a long time ago, when he was young, he wrote this excerpt to her, in which he never got the chance to give it to her:

**May: She Will Stay**

Dearest you,¬†

Whatever you‚Äôre doing right now, wherever you are, and whoever you‚Äôre with, know that I remember you. That‚Äôs all I can do‚Äîremember. I remember the way you walked, trying to match your pace with the others. The way you‚Äôd run in your oversized winter coat, chasing the train. The way you smiled, just slightly, when someone else was speaking. I remember how you‚Äôd tie your hair up, letting a few strands hang loose. It reminds me of sleepless nights, staring at the ceiling under my blanket, my mind racing like a restless dog. Outside my window, I saw stars‚Äîstars filled with madness and anger, for which they can‚Äôt even give me answers, laughing at me, twinkling their lights on my face!

You know, I can‚Äôt even write properly anymore. For the first time in my life, I didn‚Äôt know how to start. Every time I tried to put words together, it felt like the bells of Piazza del Duomo were constantly ringing in my head. With the little time we had, how long could we keep holding on to each other? You know I overthink everything.

Sometimes I just wish to hold your hand and caress them. And, never let me go.¬†

I can‚Äôt find the right words for you. My mind is consumed by thoughts of you, and it terrifies me. I don‚Äôt even know how to tell myself that you‚Äôre leaving. Dark thoughts overwhelm me until I collapse at my desk. I imagine you are gone, and I can‚Äôt stop crying. For I love you. It feels raw and incomprehensible.

Remembering you is the only thing I could do. The way you walk fast and try to keep the same pace as me, the way you run in your oversized winter coat as if you were catching the bus, the way you smile when someone else speaks, the way you tie your hair, it‚Äôs all burned into my idiotic memory.¬†¬†

He kept these writings to himself, feeling they were cheap, something no one would want to read. He felt like a loser when he accepted it. On some other days, he can‚Äôt even write, words are not pouring to his paper cup, instead it pours down to the floor, where it just splatters and perishes.¬† Other days, he‚Äôd grab a scrap of paper and write whatever came to mind in the midst of his challenges that he faced. One such paper read:

**Today, I long for you.**

God knows how I will miss you when you leave. I can‚Äôt even comprehend my own feelings, or the things left unsaid.

**The sea, as I heard**

The waves push and pull the sails from the shore

The serenity reminds me,

In a gust of wind,

I thought of the worst, Thinking that I could die,

Just thinking about you til eternity consumed me,

Standing there, just like the anchor where it kills those corals.

Then, I dreamt as I passed.

Through the city, where colonial buildings stood tall. I dreamt again, like falling in timeless doom that I, myself made. She, as I looked her from afar,¬†

All I felt was how my blood runs faster, in the middle of everyone, I stood and didn‚Äôt say anything as I froze in the moment. She came towards me, the air got colder. She asked for a hug and whispered. Autumn comes.¬†

I thought of the worst for a second. I could die in this sea, just thinking about it.¬†

**June: She Changed Her Tune**

He dreamed of living with her, Sundays filled with music, dancing, holding hands, baking cake together. He dreamt of a small farm in the backyard, with chickens. In the chaos of the world, he was just happy to have found her:

He often asked himself: Why does it have to be you? Why does my happiness depend on you? But still, his thoughts floated like a boat drifting from shore to shore. He saw the sky, the blue horizon, and uninhabited islands. But he never gave her those words, feeling they were too cheap for anyone to read, like they didn‚Äôt matter. He got so irritated in himself, that he wrote again as he found a scrap paper by the window next to him:

**The boat goes from shore to shore**, it felt like a dream.

It kept going for hours and I saw the blue sky and those uninhabited islands from afar.

**On some**¬†

Today, I felt an urge to long for you.¬†

God knows how I will miss when she is leaving home

For I can‚Äôt even comprehend my own

Or the things to be known

These questions came to mind tonight.

Like a gust of wind slowly pouring to these white coverings.¬†

**July: She Will Fly**

On some occasions, after a few drinks, she would start writing her thoughts down. It eases her to be more emotional. She wrote:

**I miss you**

I miss you like those cherry blossoms waiting for spring. I miss you as summer misses autumn. I miss you like the street I used to walk among those gray and red pavements. I miss you like children miss their bedtime stories and tales as they grow older. I miss you as candles miss from being lit.¬†I miss you like those camphor trees miss the wind that moves them around. I miss you like teabags and hot water. I miss you like eggs being separated from bacon. I miss you like mango being separated from its sticky rice. I miss you like cupcakes being separated from their icing and other decorations. I miss you like black ink being separated from a piece of paper. I miss you like music without its drums, guitars, piano, or other instruments. I miss you like umbrellas miss their rainy seasons, or even raincoats being hanged or used. I miss you like those birds as they grew older missing their old nests. I will keep missing you even when we keep getting further and further apart. Oh! I will, too, keep missing you when you grow older and older, as days go by, or even as you read this, as you grow a minute older, I will still miss you. For if you kissed and touched someone else‚Äôs lips, I will still miss you. Or even, when you decided to have a child, two, three, or even four, my God! That is a lot! Or if you decided to adopt those unfortunates, I will still miss you.¬†

**August: Die He Must**

For you are dead, darling. I couldn‚Äôt hear you and I couldn‚Äôt see you. I never asked to dream about you and yet, I did‚Äìevery night and each morning I wake up with a jumping gasp with my palms sweating.¬† To be honest, my dear, I‚Äôm not sure anymore‚Äîam I missing you or the memories we made together? Is it wrong to wish we could be together again? Because, darling, I don‚Äôt want to die alone. But it seems that only one of us can be granted that wish.

It could be night. I don‚Äôt even know how we got here. It feels like I‚Äôve been transported into this room just to speak with you. The room is long, dark, dimly lit. There was a stool, I think‚Äîwe sat down next to each other. ""Ever since we met, I‚Äôve never been able to forget you. I wanted you gone from my life, but you‚Äôve lingered for far too long. Every time I try to start a new relationship, I think of you, and I never really get the chance to move on.""Maybe that‚Äôs why I sought out someone so different from you, hoping to forget you slowly. Yet still, you linger.

**September: I‚Äôll Remember**

Her head grew heavy, her vision blurred. She whispered, ‚ÄúI will sleep now, and maybe you will be alive tomorrow.‚Äù She smiled. Waiting for the next sunlight to go across her white dress again.

I‚Äôve been on Zep for about 6 months and more recently I wake up feeling like I cannot wait another second to eat, really intense hunger pains. This isn‚Äôt due to a change in habits or routines, for many years my mornings look exactly the same. 
I have a thyroid condition so first thing in the AM I take my levothyroxine after that I wait an hour and take my probiotics. 30 minutes after my probiotics I take a B12 then I can have breakfast and my first coffee of the day. I have been following this routine for years and I‚Äôm not usually one to wake up hungry but all of a sudden this is my new normal. My fianc√© wakes up for work at 4am and when I feel him get out of bed that‚Äôs when I start feeling hungry. Since I have such a strict timeline for my medication I can‚Äôt give in and eat anything, I will usually force myself back to sleep and then when I wake up again I could go hours without eating.

I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs a MS problem or if there‚Äôs something else going on. We have our problems for years and we became parents a year ago, which was a mutual decision and actually tried for it. Of course I was under no illusion that having a baby is gonna make things better, I fear though that I was completely delusional believing everything we have talked about before pregnancy, during and after. He‚Äôs not really supportive when it‚Äôs needed and he‚Äôs letting me down very often in really simple things. I haven‚Äôt got a break since we got our baby, I‚Äôm doing everything on my own at home and for our son and it often feels like he‚Äôs blaming MS and his work stress way too much but I‚Äôm trying to keep an open eye since I really don‚Äôt know how it feels to have a chronic illness like this. Just for a bit of context, he didn‚Äôt have any real symptoms or problems with MS until 3 months ago where he had a flair up and was hospitalised for a week and took him about a month to be functioning normally again. He‚Äôs now under medication and is seemingly as normal as he was before the fair up. But he still won‚Äôt help willingly, I have to ask for everything. To put the baby to bed at night, to give me 10‚Äô in the morning to drink a bit of coffee uninterrupted, to make a grocery list, the list goes on. 
But he has really unlimited time to himself to do and achieve anything he needs and wants and also using his free time in the evening when I‚Äôm putting baby to sleep so he can‚Äôt smoke ‚Äúmedical weed ‚Äú to wind down. He will even postpone his showers and will forget important things we decided he‚Äôll do after work or before going to bed, so he can smoke. 
I‚Äôm just wondering at that point whether is an MS thing or is really just using his disability as a getaway from being a parent and a partner.

1gbsl95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Back4Blood/comments/1gbsl95/the_beststrongest_builds_ive_ever_used_in_b4b/,The Best/Strongest builds ive ever used in B4B,"I have played B4B (back 4 blood) for over 2400 hours. I played and beat nightmare before it was nerfed (primarily by speed running. The skills used greatly benefit me even now when speed running isnt easaily viable). Once no hope was released I beat it within the first week playing primarily with bots. I have used thousands of builds and have kept a couple that were just to good. I will rate each build based on dps, utility (benefit outside of dps), its healing, copper, and difficulty to get up/running. Most of the best builds I have dont require any specific weapons as that limits you and makes it harder to get up and running. The other benefit is you can find/buy cards throughout the run that can specialize you, find a good assaault rifle card? BUY IT! This increases the consistency of the build on no hope. Less luck required the better. I will also state which cleaners are good with the build. If you have questions please feel free to ask and I will attempt to respond. 

I will place builds in their respective categories in order from best to worst based soley on my opinion. Most categories will have builds that meximize their specific specialty but also have another variation that loses some of its primary value for other benefits. An example is a dps build losing some dps to increase utility or healing capabilities.

  
Tip: if altering a build it is important to know how some cards interact. If a dps card states it increases shotgun damage it MULTIPLIES the damage if you have another card that increases FLAT damage, or bullet damage, (this is why glass cannon is so good. It multiplies all other damage types.) Another example is pyro, glass cannon, improvised explosives, bomb squad, and chemical courage. Glass cannon gives 30% damage bonus, bomb squad explosive damage bonus, improvised explosives accessory damage bonus all of which multiply the damage of grenades whereas if I had 2 cards that increase accessory damage it would not be as high since they add together, Chemical courage and other cards that you do an action to activate multiply together with other damage sources (if you have to do something special for the card to work then it multiplies the other damage sources. Another example of this is confident killer or experimental stilulants.) There are many interactions like this in the game. So when in doubt take more veried damage. Example shotgun damage, with flat damage, with bullet damage, with something that needs to be activated like experimental stimulants or chemical courage.

**DPS BUILDS**



**Swap Speed DPS.** 

Best cleaner is Heng or Tala with walker also being good. Note when heng eats a food buff he gets it twice. IF someone else eats it they get it once and he gets it once. This is why he is the best for this build because cereal can greatly benefit his dps and other food can benefit him and his team (peaches for trauma heal). This is probably the strongest DPS build ive ever used. The flow of the build is to shoot one gun till you see the reload indicator and instead of reloading you switch to your other primary. Rinse and repeat for massive DPS and a very good horde clearing ability.

**SMG dps (the second best dps build in this list and does exceptionally well with a group.)** 

Best cleaners are Jim and tala with walker being third. Hoffman is a dark horse purely because he can decrease the ammo econemy burden. The flow of this build is to use an SMG as your main damage dealing weapon for both commons and specials. IF something scary comes like a monsterous talllbot or a boss press the button to switch to healing item which activates the gadget (I call it the panic fart since it releases a fart cloud and i use it when bad stuff is happening). Note: the perk experimental stimulants also increases the reload speed and damage of anyone else near you as well making it great for team play. You do however lose a slot to hold a healing item.

Walker and hoffman are also good. Hoffman again for decreasing ammo strain. Utility 0/10. Copper 0/10. Healing 0/10. Difficulty getting it set up 1/10 (all you need is an SMG of any sort).

**Full dps shotgun (Tied as second best DPS in this list)**

Best DPS is by far tala with jim being second. The flow of the build is to get a shotgun preferably the belgian and kill everything. If you dont get a benlgian then get a good primary shotgun for specials and a full auto secondary for commons.

Best cleaners are tala, heng, or walker. Again tala limits you to smg or shotguns. Heng is close on dps but has much more utility. Walker loses to both on dps but if you like him he isnt bad.

This build is probably the most well rounded on utility, healing, dps, and copper. Making it good in both solo and team set ups. Dps 7/10 with tala or heng and 5/10 with walker. Utility 10/10. Copper 6/10. Healing 7/10 only because of the toolkits you can use on health stations. Difficulty to get set up 4/10. 

**Utility SMG DPS**

Best cleaners are tala and Jim. The flow of this build is the same as the SMG dps. Just get an SMG and do good damage. Press the button to switch you your healing item which activates the gadget and do more damage. This could be the top of the list if you have a team.

**Copper Shotgun build.** 

Best cleaners Tala by far, jim, and walker are lower but usable. This deck is built to be the most bang for your buck shotgun dps cards and copper cards. The goal is you start at the beginning of an act and can buy extra cards, upgrades, ect to greatly improve the run.

It is however very expensive to do so) Tip: If you are able to buy toolkits and use those as its 50 copper cheaper and if they are upgraded their is a chance it gets re used. Difficulty to get up. 6/10 you need a decent shotgun and possibly a full auto secondary.

**All Guns**

Best cleaners with this build is Jim or tala. Tala limits you to an SMG or shotgun whereas jim can literally use anything from a sniper to a pistol. Walker is also solid with his increased damage %.

Reckless strategy

 empowered assault

This build is probably the most flexible build ive ever seen for dps. The biggest benefit is you can pick up ANY gun you find and use it. See a blue barret on the first mission no one can use? PICK IT UP! Also you can specialize during a run. Find a good assault rifle card? BUY IT! no worries at all. This also means if you are playing with randoms you can always switch weapon types for ammo econemy. Dps 7/10, Utility 0/10, Copper 0/10, Healing 0/10. Difficulty getting it set up 0/10.

**Do it all DPS Shotgun**

Best cleaners are tala by far but jim is also good. Flow of the build is to find a decent shotgun for kill things with and you are able to kill things pretty well while also being able to heal lives, trauma, and getting copper for your team. This is the most focused on doing no hope with randoms that join the lobby.

**Pinata Shotgun build**

Best character with this build is hoffman for utility and tala for damage. The flow of the build is to set up at a choke point and use molotovs to kill commons and generate items. Then use a shotgun for killing things. This makes tala good for her dps with shotgun and hoffman good with his generation of offensive items.

Difficulty getting it set up. 9/10. To truely get the best of your offensive items you need to upgrade offensive item accessories and get more slots which takes many missions and lots of copper to do. 

**Solo Sniper.**

Best cleaner is Jim with walker being second. The flow of the build is similar to the SMG dps before this except you have a sniper primary for specials with an automatic secondary for commons. You can quickly go from killing commons, switch to your sniper shoot a special a couple of times and swap back which is usually very difficult with sniper builds.

**Meme Sniper build.** 

This build is not good unless you have a very good team that can kill EVERY SINGLE COMMON RIDDEN. It is however increadibly fun and silly. This build is best on Heng, or walker. The flow of the build is to get 2 bolt action snipers. After every single shot swap weapons and you can shoot them VERY quickly. Get swap speed stocks on both and its faster than shooting the M1A. The recoil is REDICULOUS and you cant kill commons almost at all but you can pretty much stagger lock specials. It doesnt do as much damage as it could since its so squishy

**MELEE BUILDS**

**No trauma Melee (This build was created by swing poynt on youtube. It is the best melee build imo.)** 

The goal of the build is to protect the dps from commons so they can kill specials. Best characters are Hoffman (free offensive accessories can not be underestimated.), Sharice, Holly, Doc. In that order.

**Super overheal Melee**

**Death Melee MEME build**

Best characters are holly, hoffman (for offensive item generation)  or dan (for going down buffs), Walker is also good due to increased damage %. Literally with this build the goal is to go down in a choke point and kill everything for your team. The reason this isnt better is because it sucks when you dont have a choke point and you can do the same thing as pinata without the resource costs. Best weapon with this is a firemans axe

Copper 6/10 (really its 0/10 because all that copper will be used to get your lives back.) difficulty getting it set up 2/10 you need a firemans axe for best results

**Healing builds**

**LITERALLY MY ONLY HEALING BUILD**

Best characters with this build is doc with mom also being good. The reason this is my only healing build is in no hope taking damage is the worst thing you can do. You either kill stuff before it gets close or you lose the DPS check and die anyway on top of that many of the DPS builds ive shown before have utility and healing build in somewhat. This is the best healer build ive found but you really need to have a very strong DPS on the team. Like 9/10 10/10 dps builds. The build is meant to be used primarily with bandages as once they are leveled you get re use chances giving more trauma healing then med kits for the price. The are also much more easy to find. For the copper of 1 med kit you get 6-12 trauma health restored with chance to be re used over 15 from 1 health kit. They are also much harder to find using support scavenger.

**Niche builds that are not always useful**

**Stun Gun Pinata (actuall a very solid build)**

Use hoffman to generate items or walker to maximize boss killing potential. The flow of the build is to run in and out of areas to melee to proc experimental stun gun and pinata to generate items then use those items to kill specials or distract commons

Ability to get up and running 8/10. you need an aa12, a move speed stock (preferable the one that makes it so you cant run), the legendary move speed scope, These 3 things makes this very difficult to get up to a point that its good.

**Copper and scavengers for those who dont like to shoot stuff but still want to help. This is not a healing build**

This build is best with hoffman for his item generation capabilities.

Dps 0/10, utility 10/10, copper 6/10, Healing 6/10 since you can make toolkits, medkits, and healing items. Difficulty getting it set up 0/10. You literally need nothing since you cant do damage and cant heal. What is the purpose of this build then? It generates lots of items for the team and provides the best utility if you already have a good team. IF you have good movement you can also do objectives for the team while they fight from a good spot and wait for you to get back to them. 

**Bait jars build**

Best cleaners are hoffman due to the possiblity of killing things with the bait jars and getting more. Tala with a shotgun if you want to bhe a bit better at dps. This build provides a lot of safety to a team but is useless if your team cant kill things. Throw bait jars on every special or boss. If a second person in the game runs hazmat specialist you will never run out of bait jars.

**Literally die dan MEME build.** 

This build was build for Dan and is actually kind of good in a group but terrible with randoms. This build is basically an off healer with lots of utility and able to go revive people in bad spots. 

avenge the fallen (you can cheese this to make bosses very easy. Kill everyone and revive everyone till they are on their last life then everyone shoot the boss and it stacked this skill to make damage rediculous. It only lasts a short time however). If used with a team you can use avenge the fallen to cheese bosses, out with a bang to cheese swarms, and copper to fund it all. When used solo you can watch as nothing dies and sadness envelopes you.

1gbskyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1gbskyf/skincare_recipe/,Skincare recipe,"All of these are already very common ingredients in skin care products- (acetyl)salicylic acid, niacinamide, sulphur- but I make it with supplements I already have at hand, making it super cheap. It is extremely effective against acne:

The main ingredients are these three:

* the base is niacinamide powder. lots of it. mine has some taurine in it for no reason, don't think that it is doing much. no additives of course. the reason I add A LOT is for it to be used a bit as a face mask. 
* Flowers of sulphur. had the idea after seeing how common sulphur soaps were in southern countries, and someone told me he got rid of all his acne with it. 
* some aspirin pills (only additives are corn starch) 

Adding water will make it into a thick paste. use a little tupperware so it doesn't dry out (if not it will dry out in half an hour, add water to rehydrate)

These are extra things I add for texture and preservation:

*  little bit baking soda
* little bit of coconut oil
* little bit of progest-e -
* tiny bit of aleppo soap (gonna leave this out next time, so I can still eat the mixture)
* old coffee

I wanna try using coffee for the base next time instead of water. Caffeine also has great effects on the skin. 

Mine is a thick paste and I used to put on a thick mask, but found that just spreading it out to where it's barely visible works even better. It turns white after a while. It instantly tightens the skin, and will speed up the 'ripening' process of existing zits while preventing the new ones.",1,1729857748.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

1gbskk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1gbskk0/how_to_get_out_of_bed/,How to get out of bed ,"I started elvanse last week so I quit coffee at the same time. Coffee for me is THE thing that got me out of bed, it is honestly an anti depressant for me. 

At the moment I'm waking up and eating a big breakfast and taking the elvanse but then have an hour and a half before it kicks in, in which time I feel super depressed and can't get out of bed. I have no motivation because coffee is the thing I was using for this previously. I don't know how to tackle this

I can't have anything with caffeine at the same time as elvanse. I can have a green tea a couple of hours later and that hugely helps my mood and motivation and I can't do the whole ""wake up, take elvanse, go back to sleep"" thing cause I have to eat etc and it wakes me up. 

I don't really know how to combat this cause it can set me up for a really bad day mental health wise. I'm only 2 weeks in and on 20mg atm so realise this is probably too low a dose as the green tea is doing more for me now than the elvanse in all honesty. I'm a bit stuck. Any advice appreciated!

I felt like the third wheel. My advice: Don‚Äôt EVEN TRY to date your coworker.
She even lied to her husband that there was one extra female colleague. Also I have to add, she is really flirtatious with men‚Ä¶

**Upon entering the home, it has been discovered that the whole house is covered in trash and filth. There is one single path through the filth barely wide enough to walk through and poses**
a health risk and fire hazard. The house also has a bad smell of filth and expired food. There are bugs and maggots all over the counter tops and the backyard is very overgrown and has trash all over as well. The residents mental health is declining and all signs point to the issue of the home only getting worse. The home is posing a potential safety risk for police officers when responding to any more calls for service.

1gbsi3v,https://i.redd.it/ah8l3s2h6wwd1.jpeg,Paris Corner perfumes are here to stay‚Ä¶ ,"‚ÄúI received three Paris Corner fragrance decants today: Khair Fusion (10ml), Eternal Coffee (5ml), and French Coffee (5ml).

Firstly, I‚Äôm thoroughly impressed with the thoughtful packaging and the charming little gift that accompanied the order. A big thanks to u/Daegu_Venus65 for making the delivery so seemless and without any hassle. 

As for the fragrances:

French Coffee: This is an intense, robust coffee fragrance, perfect for those who savor the depth of black coffee without sweetness. A single spray delivers a rich, pure coffee aroma, which will undoubtedly resonate with true coffee enthusiasts.

Eternal Coffee: Compared to French Coffee, Eternal Coffee offers a subtler coffee scent, enhanced by a creamy hint of vanilla. Personally, I find this fragrance particularly captivating, as its softer and creamier profile brings a comforting warmth that sets it apart.

Khair Fusion: This is the standout fragrance of the trio. Khair Fusion opens with a delightful blend of lychee, blackcurrant, and apple, gradually developing into a floral heart of rose and jasmine.

I am attending a full-day workshop for work today. The organizer sent an email out initially saying coffee/tea are provided but to bring a lunch and I was like ""of course I'm bringing my own lunch"". She sent another email yesterday afternoon to say there is a ""light lunch provided"" and my response was just disappointment.
Does anyone else mostly hate other people's food and desperately avoid eating free lunches or having dinner at someone's home?

When I was a child, I used to lie to friends that my Mom was really strict and I had to go home for dinner. As an adult, these free lunches at work events are just like instant dread.
I have always been a picky eater and I had a period of a few years as an adult where I was vegetarian so it was a great excuse to bring my own food. Now, there are too many dietary accommodations so I can't even get out of food obligations by being lactose intolerant or vegetarian. I'm slowly coming to accept that just saying something like ""I don't like other people's food"" could be an acceptable response but the unmasking is going against everything I learned as a child.

And for my ADHD side, yes, I am writing this when I need to be leaving for work in 10 minutes and am half dressed and have no lunch packed yet. ",4,1729857403.0,AuDHDWomen,1,0.83,False

1gbsdoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1gbsdoz/100ish_days/,100-ish days,"Greetings fellow seamen, captains of our own ships!

Time for an update.

**How did these 100 days progress?**  
I started out with SR around the same time I experienced a medically unexplainable loss of consciouscness. It freaked me out that I temporarily wasn't there at all anymore despite my beliefs in the afterlife. I was looking into spirituality and related things and thus I found the SR videos on youtube.

**First month**  
Feeling emboldened by my new practice, I had great amounts of energy and I spent most of it fixing up my house and garden after workdays. I had some struggledays not fapping, but it wasn't that hard. *Just to clarify going forward: when I say 'I had struggle days', it just means I stayed on the correct path despite wanting to sin. I have not sinned against my path since I started it 100 days ago.*

Around week 3 I encountered a couple during a day in a spa resort. I didn't interact with them, but they were beautiful people and it felt like I could see they were 'real'. As in that they had found themselves and eachother and didn't feel any need to withhold anything about them to the outside world. They were very inspiring to me and I vowed to the Sun (God, if you will) and myself be a better man, to become *me*.

**Second month**

Energy aplenty, kept going strong at work and at home. It was almost like there was no real limit to my energy. This is where I started reading books again, which wasn't possible before since my brain was fried by the digital world. I regained focus and being able to concentrate on reading words. These things have only improved since then.  
Naturally, I was also cutting back on anything digital or too frivolous. I wanted to spent my time with useful and fulfilling things.

I was also able to have sex without orgasming, which I was happy about ofcourse (and she).

**End of September**

I experienced my first wet dream, it was fun, but ofcourse  it was shocking too. This wasn't what I was planning and I was very sad a moment. But I planned to better my thoughts and stop lusting and thinking of doing kink stuff. Although I didn't use my hands, it still felt like I had provoked this myself and did a lot of soulsearching to prevent this from happening again.

This is when the flatline started. Which, in reality, is probably just the feeling of missing the energy buildup I was experiencing all those weeks. I am a believer in the '*Christ oil*' theory, so a single drop wasted is a restart in a physiological sense. Now I find solace in the fact that (as has been said so many times on this sub) this is not about 'streaks', it is a way of life. You keep being your best self despite any setbacks. It took a while to really get it. But I do now.

This month is also the time I started developing better eating habits; more vegetables, fruits and nuts. Less sugar, less coffee, less processed foods. This was inspired by the book 'Salts and the Zodiac' by George Carey. Which also inspired me to take essential cell salts specific to my zodiac sign.

  
**Now (october)**

The flatline has continued up until this day even (25th), and this night I experienced a nocturnal emission. No dreaming, just the emission. I haven't found any reason that might have triggered it. My thoughts are way cleaner than before, my food intake is very healthy, my body works out a lot during my workdays, I clean our house even more regularly (not that I was a slob before), I read spiritual books, I treat people with love when I can.  
Might it be (says a voice in the outer reaches of my consciousness) that the bar is set ever higher when raising your standards? In other words...yes I did stop lusting. But did I stop completely? No. Do I eat more healthy? Yes. but I still eat a snack once or twice a month.  


When we raise our standards, our body will comply. But the new you will still want to raise the standard, because it sees imperfection that weren't visible before, when the bar was lower. Imperfections will be visible always up until the work is done. It's just a matter to what visible light spectrum is being seen.

I wish you all the same or more strength I found and want to close with this;

*There isn't any reason for me to stop walking this path anymore, the path itself has changed me and the goal has become subordinate.*

Hi everyone,

out of personal need I built a nutrition app with techniques from the gaming industry. I've been using it for months now and I believe it could fill the niche of diet apps, that keep users motivated. So I am working on making it available to others.

However, I am worried about the launch as I've never done something like this before. I've read some books on it and many articles online.

Here is my plan (please criticize it!):

# Launch a beta, not an untested product

The app for sure has flaws I don't know about it. Also: Will users actually like it? A beta with interested people can identify flaws and give valuable feedback of what believes I had about the app are wrong.

# Find white-hot users / superusers

This is from Amy Jo Kim's book **Game Thinking**. The idea is to find people, that have such a burning need for the product, that they would put up with a flawed early version **AND** give feedback. For this, I plan to post a preview of the app in the corresponding subreddits. (Also: Someone interested already? *\*half-joking*)

# Listen to their feedback

Among technical issue, the core idea is validated during this step. Iterating on the learnings happens here and this step is repeated over and over, until users start to stick with it.

# Months later... public launch, maybe?

Should the app make it this far, a public launch is in order. I haven't read up on directories and Product Hunt in particular, but this aspect seems quite important. Of course, I hope to retain many of the people that kindly shared their time during development (I plan to offer something special to them, as their feedback is just so invaluable!)

Now: Criticize away! Is it that bad?

The system is completely broken right now and it has to be an oversight. The urn system/comeback mechanic will determine the urn drop off when someone first pick up the currently available urn. The system will tally souls of ONLY PLAYERS WHO ARE ALIVE on each team and weights the total souls against another to determine which team get the favorable urn position. Therefore, even if your team is ahead or even, if just one player goes down and the urn simply get picked up, the urn drop off will be on your side of the map if the total souls of 5 alive players is less than total of 6 players on the other team. Also ,you don't even have to deliver the urn right away. The drop off location will remains until the urn de-spawn and switches sides, which gives the down players plenty of time to respawn and gather for the favorable urn contest on your team's side of the map.

Here is my team getting a favorable urn drop off location while being 20k ahead because I picked up the urn when my team had 2 people down and enemy team only had 1 player down.

1gbrylp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gbrylp/are_we_asking_men_out_these_days_or/,Are we asking men out these days or?,"I seem to encounter this dilemma a lot online. For example, I was talking to a man who lives very close to me for around 3-4 days. Our texting style wasn't very compatible (e.g., he didn't ask a lot of thoughtful, intelligent questions, moreso the 'what are you doing'/flirty emojis/stream of all-day texts/double and triple texts) but I thought I'd see if we had a connection in real life as some people don't translate well online. He wasn't making plans to meet up, so I suggested that we get a coffee nearby. However, I was unwell with Covid and had to cancel. He continued texting me without any initiative, so I disengaged. It could be that he wasn't very interested, but he doubled texted me today asking me if 'I was still there' and is very persistently trying to get my attention.

Recently, I was talking to another man who suggested we meet near his work. Well, he proceeded to ask ME where to meet/go as he ""only worked there so didn't really know of any places."" I ended up suggesting a place. He was super interested and texted me after the date asking for a second one. However, the lack of first date initiative has somewhat dampened my interest in him.

I don't know if men have different expectations these days but I am finding it a bit fatiguing having to also carry the 'mental load' this early on into getting to know someone. For most of these dates, it is still clear I am putting more time and money into looking good, making sure I have safe transportation there and back, and so forth.

1gbryi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/1gbryi9/is_there_anything_wrong_with_my_history_of_the/,"Is there anything wrong with my history of the Cola Nut?
","The cola nut has deep roots in the social and spiritual traditions of West African peoples, especially among groups like the Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa. It was and still is used in ceremonies, rituals, and as a sign of hospitality.

It came to be held in high esteem as it was thought to treat injuries, restore vitality and was commonly viewed as magical. Due to its caffeine content, the cola nut started becoming essential during times of exhaustion and craving food, particularly in times of hunger or prolonged physical activity.

Understanding the physical properties of the nut helped the natives to accept it more, which further increased its value in the trade market across West Africa. It was transported over the Sahara and blended into the Trans-Saharan Trade where continental west African traders carried the cola nut to north Africa, mostly Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. While slaves and gold proved to be the main trading commodities, cola nuts became popular among the people because of their stimulating properties which were comparable to the uses of coffee and tea.

In the case of Islamic North Africa, where the cola nut was not popularised as a culture in West Africa, it had an occasional relevance amongst the elite and the traders. During important travels, it was used on occasion for its mild stimulating effect, and it became famous for its ability¬†to suppress hunger and fatigue.

Some Sufi sects may have adopted the usage of cola nuts in rituals or spiritual practices that required heightened focus or energy because they were thought to have medical effects. In this way, the stimulating qualities of the nut were prized in an area where drinking tea and coffee was already culturally important.

Occasionally, the cola nut was shipped to regions of the Middle East. It did not, however, become as well-known as other commodities like coffee or spices.

The cola nut was mainly unknown or regarded as an exotic African product in Eurasia, especially in Ottoman Turkey, Persia, and portions of Southwest Asia. Only sporadic mentions of its usage can be found in Arab or Persian literature, primarily by traders or tourists who came into contact with it while conducting business in Africa.

Although its stimulant qualities were usually eclipsed by the more common usage of coffee and qat, West African Muslim pilgrims occasionally brought cola nuts as part of their provisions when they traveled to Mecca for the Hajj, which further contributed to its spread throughout the Islamic world.

In the 19th century, European explorers & conquerors of west Africa came into contact with the nut. As a result, the nut's stimulating qualities attracted further attention, and Western scientists developed an interest in the cola nut's active components, theobromine and caffeine. The cola nut extract was used in early soft drinks by the 1880s, most notably in the production of Coca-Cola (1886), which was first sold as a medicinal tonic. The name ""Coca-Cola"" came from its two main ingredients back then: coca leaf extract (which had traces of cocaine taken out by the early 1900s) and cola nut extract. Pepsi-Cola (1893) started as ""Brad's Drink"" but changed to Pepsi-Cola in 1898. It also had cola nut extract and other stuff in its first recipe giving people an energizing drink with health perks.   
  
In the early 1900s, people wanted more cola-based soft drinks after Prohibition (1920‚Äì1933) when many folks switched to soft drinks instead of alcohol. As companies made more, getting lots of cola nuts became tough and pricey. Man-made caffeine, not from plants, became a cheaper option than cola nuts. Better chemical flavoring meant companies could make drinks that tasted like cola without needing the actual nut. Coca-Cola and Pepsi started to phase out natural cola nut extract bringing in artificial flavors and lab-made caffeine instead. This change allowed them to keep their product more consistent and get a better handle on production costs.   
  
In the years following World War II, as the soft drink industry became more industrialized, companies streamlined their ingredients even further.Coca-Cola and Pepsi put their efforts into creating recipes they could produce on a large scale without spending too much. This change went hand in hand with the growing use of artificial flavors in food and drinks.   
  
Come the 1950s, and both companies had pretty much stopped using cola nuts in their drinks. The cola taste now came from a blend of other spices and lab-made ingredients, like vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and oils from citrus fruits, to copy the original flavor.",1,1729855580.0,AskHistory,0,0.67,False

I could tell she was on the verge of breaking down. She kept looking away when the discussion came back around to the reality of her situation. She was about forty, had no real job, took too many psyche meds, and leaned pretty heavy on Suboxane to maintain her drug usage.
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

She had also suffered trauma after trauma in her life, a life that had left her, her mom, and her daughter living in that big old house out in the country all alone now. A life that had led her to sitting in a bar parking lot with a homeless guy about two in the afternoon, clothes overflowing from the trunk into the backseat, wondering where she was going to go from here.
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Night before last night, I tried to sleep in the car to save on motel money, and damn. I didn't sleep a wink, dude. It was hot, I kept hearing things, thought I heard somebody sneaking up on me all night, and I don't know if someone was or not, I couldn't look. I was like, frozen in fear.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Well, it's a safe bet that there probably someone that  was out there.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""You think?"" She turned to look at me and saw the half smile on my face, "" You bastard. You shouldn't scare me even more than I already am."" 


She looked absent from the scene for a second, then in the most monotone robotic voice added, ""It was too hot to sleep.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Baby doll, it hasn't begun to get hot yet.""n
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""I don't know how you do it.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Yeah, you've said so about ten times now.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

Erica was in a real bind. Her stepfather had just passed away, which meant her mom had nothing better to do than start digging into her daughters day to day life to find stuff to be hyper critical of. And, of course the scrutiny led to blow-out arguments, which led to Erica getting in touch with some old friends. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

She had always struggled with one addiction after another in her life and had been holding it together fairly well until her stepdad passed away. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

She really didn't like using the word ""stepdad"" at all, and after his death, it seemed like everyone who came to visit or show their respect had been determined to make sure they drove that home. Step-dad. At one point, she had to remove herself from her ""step aunts"" vicinity to keep from putting a serving fork in her face, and she still wasn't convinced she made the right choice by walking away. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

It seemed throughout the entire time of organized mourning, she had been relegated to second tier, and it wasn't fair, and it wasn't the way it should be, and Mark would have told everyone if he hadn't died. 


The entire twenty-seven years that he had been in her life, she remembered the ""step"" word being used maybe five times, and always in an official capacity, such as government paperwork. After about three years, she had just gradually slipped from calling him Mark to calling him dad, and Mark seemed pleased not to correct her. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

Mark had been the one to try and weed out the boyfriends. 


He had been the one to get in the car at three in the morning to find someplace open that sold Tylenol when she was fifteen, sick, and her fever was spiking. He also got in the car at three in the morning to find someplace open that sold vanilla ice cream when she was pregnant with Joanna. He sure seemed like a real dad when he took off that night to indulge her. 


Mark was fond of telling people that he had given her away twice, but she always found her way back home. But she knew full well that he had been the one who argued to let her move back in when her second marriage turned into a master class of domestic abuse. 


It was Mark who had put an end to the physical violence for a few years, at least. Her ex came for Thanksgiving dinner, half a fifth of Wild Turkey, about a gram of meth, and five Zannies in the wind and decided that Erica was his by God woman and he would treat her as he pleased and anywhere he pleased. It didn't take long of that before Mark put the business end of a twelve gauge in his face to drive home a promise. To do onto him ten times worse what he does onto his little girl. 


He even went as far as to tell Jimmy that he would be well advised to start praying that Erica doesnt experience a clumsy spell, as that could lead to an unmarked grave somewhere in the mountains.
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

Jimmy must have taken him seriously because the abuse was entirely psychological for almost four years. That was when Jimmy hit full-blown amphetamine psychosis and started getting handsy. But Erica had seen it coming and was ready. Her and Joanna took off and promised to never return in exchange for Mark not making good on his promise. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

Mark was a good man. He was kind, hardworking, musically talented, a great sense of humor, and more loving and kind-hearted than Erica even knew was possible. Every since he put his boots in the mudroom for good, he had been the father she had needed him to be. 


He had stepped right up and never complained. He had kept her together more than she had realized, but now all that was gone. And no one seemed to even care how profoundly his passing had affected her.
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

Soon, she found herself running out of places to stash the half pint and pint bottles where her mom wouldn't see them. They were building up faster than Erica would have thought they would, and it was starting to concern her. Not that she might be drinking too much, but that she had to find ways to keep her drinking out of sight. That was the real problem. The meth was only for when everything got too much and the coffee couldn't get any stronger. 


The arrangements, school for Joanna, running errands for her mom, trying to work her part-time job when she could. It wasn't a problem. There had only been two or three times that she had crashed so hard that her mom had to get Joanna to school or give her breathing treatments, or help her with homework at the library, or make food, do the laundry, or just be the adult. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

Suffice to say that it didn't take long before her mother told her to get out. Even got child protective services involved. Her mom had made it clear that she was not to come back until she was clean and sober. While her mom may have been right with her assessment, her approach only served to do more harm than good. For example, she took all of her psyche meds away and demanded that Erica go cold turkey from those as well. Anyone who has even been through that drill knows how bad of a thing that is to do. 


Her mom rounded them up and flushed them because everyone needs to experience the possible life changing ramifications of going at life raw like that, especially under times of extreme stress, you know, like the loss of a father. 


The fact that she was sitting here coherent spoke volumes to her strength and durability. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

Her mother said that if Erica needed to get over her psychological issues, then all she needed to do was pray more. With feeling this time. I say the best thing she could do for her psychological issues is put a couple of states between herself and her mom. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""There's no way I can do this. I won't make it."" Her speech was really starting to betray her exhaustion now, ""I honestly thought I could do the homeless thing. How could it be hard? Just hang around, maybe get high, crash out, and do it again. I don't think I've ever been more wrong about anything in my life.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Well, except maybe that shirt."" I have an unreasonable hatred of Guns and Roses.
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Axel Rose called and said you need to get in line.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Be a company man?""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Get with the program. You know G and R rocks.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""I do?""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Indeed you do.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""If I did, I sure as hell wouldn't admit it to you. I saw them live and barely escaped with my sanity.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Barely, hunh?""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""Well, I ain't the one hanging out with some random homeless dude to try and find the key to life.""
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

At least she had a facade of a smile now. She held her fist up to me, starting acting like her thumb was the arm on a pencil sharpener, turning it slowly as her expletive finger slowly came to full attention. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† 

""You have a chance to keep this from being your reality. You know that. Right? A very doable way for you to put your life back in order. If you don't, then life out here is going to snowball for you until there is no going back. Two years from now, you won't be able to recognize yourself in the mirror.

This morning my 20 month old started saying ""Momma toes help"" while pointing at her feet beforewe even left her room. Unzipped her sleeper only to discover the diaper had exploded inside of the sleeper and the particles were down by her foot. 

Can someone tell me why this is happening and how to fix it? FTM and I'm a little lost at the moment. ",1,1729854294.0,toddlers,8,1.0,False

He then told me we have told eachother we like eachother but I ""never actually cheated on you"". To him emotional cheating isn't real cheating. I now know 2 months since breakup he is already staying over at hers regularly he says they are still just ""friends"". I'm trying to be so nice to him as we now share a baby, I have to know did he do more than just emotionally cheat on me?

# ‚ÄúEven now, we are inspired by each other"" 

From the love reality series ""The Boyfriend"" (hereinafter BF), three memorable and unique characters are making a comeback: charismatic dancer Yusaku, puppy-like boy Ikuo, who joined in the second half, and everyone's older brother Taeheon!

**The best part of BF is not only love. It's the friendship that grows in your daily life, and your own growth. Although their love didn't come to fruition, the three of them, who had a strong presence, look back on those days. And even now, their relationship has not cooled...**

**Taeheon:** This may just be my image, but I think gay people are often attracted to the other person's appearance. But in reality, what attracted me most about living together was the inner side of everyone. Yusaku is the best because he has a gentle face that is the complete opposite of his powerful stage presence, and Ikuo is handsome but also has a surprisingly absent-minded side that makes him cute! ... and so on (laughs).

**Ikuo**: I'm happy‚ô™  I admired Alan's great love. I want to be like him someday. Also, there is one big change that I made from that lifestyle. That is my appearance.  I was sometimes confused by the way I looked when I saw myself on the show  (laughs). Thanks to the influence of Gensei-san I want to polish myself more.

**‚Äî ‚ùìLooking back now, what does ""Green Room"" mean?**

**Ikuo:** Hmm... It's a class for me. A lot of things happen in a class, right? Fights, reconciliations, things like that.

**Taeheon**: A transfer student named Ikuo came (laughs). For me, it was like a school trip and an adult's summer vacation. I was excited and shining.

**Yusaku:** Sounds good. And then training camp?

**Ikuo:** That's true! I work in a coffee truck and practice how to make coffee at home. But we also eat meals together and have time to relax... it's like a training camp!

**Taeheon:** Hahaha. Even though we met after such a long time, the atmosphere is the same as always. I don't think I'll ever meet someone who I can share such deep feelings with as the members of BF. At first, we were unfamiliar with living together and being around cameras...we were friends who overcame those kinds of confusions together.

**Ikuo:** Even now, we are all inspired by each other. I'm currently working hard to become an actor, but there are people like Ryota-san who are ahead.

**Yusaku:** Everyone is more sophisticated and attractive now than  they were back then.

**Taeheon:** And BF was also an opportunity to discover my own charm, wasn't it? I got a response to the words I said, and it gave me confidence.  I didn't know my words could resonate so deeply with people!  I'm grateful that I was able to discover a new side of myself.

**Yusaku:** Ikuo-kun... It was wonderful to see him fall in love so honestly.

**Ikuo:** Until then, I had a strong desire to be loved, but I learned there that love doesn't come in return unless you love yourself. So I have no regrets now that I was able to express my feelings!

**Yusaku:** I was attractive...?

**Taeheon:** Seriously! There were so many discoveries to make and it was so fascinating.

**Yusaku:** I was happy that people liked my Tara-chan imitation ...

**Taeheon:** That contrast in Yusaku is what makes him so attractive.

**Yusaku:** I see, so I can be confident in my natural self. I've never cried in my life, let alone in front of others. But when I left Green Room, I realized I was crying. I remembered every single scene of everyday life, like waking up in the morning and seeing someone there, hanging out the members' laundry... Those were the days when I felt like ""I want to spend more time with everyone.""

**‚Äî ‚ùì So, if there is a ""Season 2"" with new members joining in, would you like to participate again?**

**Yusaku:** I would want to participate.

**Ikuo:** Me too‚ô™  What about Taeheon?

**Taeheon:** Me too! And this time, I really want to fall in love. To borrow Dai's words, I want to immerse myself in the world of love ""until I'm in completely worn out""!

From the love reality series ""The Boyfriend"", which is filled with the kindness of nine boys, the beloved boy Kazuto and the passionate man Alan, who won him over, appear. What are their thoughts now?

**Kazuto, who embraces others with a quiet smile, and Alan, who shines on everyone with his bright smile.** 

**The relationship between Kazuto and Alan is like that of the moon and the sun. In this episode, they revealed stories that only they knew about each other, and revealed their surprising true selves.**

**Kazuto:** Living together with strangers in the Green Room was refreshing and stressful... But Alan's cheerfulness broke down the walls in my heart, and I felt comfortable around him. But Alan is wonderful no matter who he's with. Even when I was listening to him talking to other people in the living room, I'd say ""What a nice thing to say."" He's not just a cheerful person.

**Alan:** He saw through that on our first date at the inn. He said to me, ""Alan, you're so friendly, but I feel like there's something dark about you."" Do you remember that?

**Kazuto:** Yes, yes.

**Alan:** I was trying to be the ""cheerful Alan"" but Kazuto was the one who made me think ""Maybe I can share the other side of myself with you.""  If you think about it, my way of showing affection is by hugging you and saying ""Yeeees!"" But Kazuto showed his love by getting up early and making me breakfast. Although we express it differently, I felt a commonality in the depth of our love, so I wanted to talk to this person more.

**Kazuto:** Eh... I'm a little embarrassed (blushing). Oh, it didn't come out like that on the show, but Alan and I were good friends and we joked around a lot.

**Alan:** Oh yeah, it was fun too! Kazuto, you‚Äôre surprisingly a gal in your heart, aren‚Äôt you? ( Laugh)

**Kazuto:** If anything, I'm quite a gal now (laughs). Whenever I say something like, ""That's super cool\~"", Alan is the one who joins in.

**Alan:** Yes, everyone! Kazuto's life is far from being a gyaru, but he has talent. My special skill, ""butt shaking,"" wasn't shown much, but thanks for going along with it (laughs). Kazuto enjoys things that some people would be put off by and say ""What, seriously?""

**Kazuto:** Oh, I can't stop laughing when I think about it (laughs). It was fun to have Alan in that life.

**Alan:** Hey! I'm saying this for the first time, but my secret goal in the Green Room was to ""have fun with everyone."" I wanted to share the excitement with everyone and have fun, not just be the only one who's cheerful.

**Kazuto:** So that's why we were able to ""share our souls"" through laughter!?

**Alan:** Sharing our souls!? Yes, Kazuto is actually passionate. OK, I love that Kazuto too!

**‚Äî ‚ùìKazuto was extremely popular with boys and was unrivaled, so why did you choose Alan?**

**Kazuto:** Because he‚Äôs comfortable (firmly). Everyone has their own reasons for liking someone, for me it‚Äôs just a ""feelings thing"" (laughs).

**Alan:** I also specialize in feelings‚ô™

**Kazuto:** Also, I was not good at expressing my feelings in words, but Alan's ability to convey his feelings to others influenced me and I was able to change. So when I confessed my feelings to Ryota and the other members, I think I was able to express them clearly.

**Alan:** I see. But home... Oh, I call the Green Room ""home"" in my heart, but before I went home I was more laid back. Because that way I wouldn‚Äôt get hurt. But when I met Kazuto at home, for some reason my impatience disappeared and I was able to think carefully about the other person before taking action.

**Kazuto:** Did you change from a laid back fast-paced type to a more mature slow-paced type after meeting me?

**Alan:** Uh... yeah?? That mysterious side of you is also cute! That's why Kazuto is still very important to me. I think about it every day.

**Kazuto:** If you say that to me again... I won‚Äôt be able to say anything (blushes).

Here‚Äôs how I get around the blocks and get ChatGPT to do my bidding:

So my general workflow these days once I have figured out my general plot.

*Using o1*
This must all be in the same chat:
1. Design my characters it doesn‚Äôt have to be anything fancy yet, just names, brief descriptions
2. Design my story narrative - how the general arc or the story progresses. I generally tell it to loosely based it on a Hero‚Äôs Journey framework
3. Design my locations - where each beat takes place in the story
Note: *it doesn‚Äôt have to be spicy yet, we will work that in later*

*Switch to 4o*
1. Copy and paste all the above answers into 4o
Tell it to integrate the above answers to come up with a verbose description of the first chapter of a ‚ÄúContemporary Romance Story‚Äù
2. Refine this manually editing the bits you don‚Äôt like
3. When happy with your first chapter description move to a fresh chat with 4o
4. Ask it to write the opening sentence to chapter one using the style of your favourite author, I‚Äôm a Murakami stan so this works well for me
5. Ask it to write the next 3 sentences ‚ÄúPlease write the next 3 sentences‚Äù
6. Keep refining but do this by rewriting your last prompt - so the chat log doesn‚Äôt have any of the story that you didn‚Äôt like in it 
e.g. ‚ÄúPlease write the next 3 sentences but make add more dialogue‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlease write the next 3 sentences but focus on the taste of the coffee‚Äù

Continue until you are happy with your basic first chapter

*Now to add some spice üå∂Ô∏è*
Copy and paste the parts of the first chapter into a separate word document
1. Open up the parts of the chapter that need more sexual tension
2. Go to DreamPress AI and sign up for a free acc
3. Set up your story using their flow but paste in the parts (character descriptions) you made from o1, In the chapter description use what was made by 4o
4. Go to the part that needs more sexual tension, highlight and use their refine tool say ‚Äúadd more sexual tension‚Äù
5. Use their free beta model if you run out of credits and make sure to turn explicit mode on

When it comes to Erotic scenes 
I still set them up using ChatGPT but then write the actual explicit parts using DreamPress AI. I then use the separate word document to collage them all together.
Occasionally I copy and paste it into HuggingChat and say ‚ÄúPlease make this chapter flow more naturally, do not change any details, just integrate the wording‚Äù

Hope that helps!

TLDR:
1. O1 for plots and character
2. 4o for verbose descriptions of 1 and prose
3. DreamPress AI for sex scenes
4. HuggingChat to bring it all together",1,1729853006.0,ChatGPTJailbreak,1,0.67,False
1gbracr,https://www.reddit.com/r/tooyoungtobethissick/comments/1gbracr/any_advice_on_how_to_manage_life_and_energy/,Any advice on how to manage life and energy levels? also a bit of a rant,"I was kind of hoping that i would get a diagnosis and a cure, and now since i feel this thing is not going away tomorrow; i am asking for advice. Im aware that things are individualistic and sickness dependent, but i dont have a diagnosis so generall advice is appreciated. 

For me the issues im facing are two categories : working and personal life.  (this part is a rant and context)

*  I pretty much given up on personal life things. Since im autistic i need hobbies to mentally energize, more so than NT people i would say. I also get more drained from work and socializing, so both is a big investment for me. Nonetheless, its the physical issue that is making my life increasingly hard to navigate. I was able to do way more things before, because i had more energy and less pain. 
* I have to rely on my partner for most of the chores at home. If i do the dishes, i get dizzy because im standing for too long. I cannot walk the dog, because i ll collapse and get a migraine. If i play with the dog i may have a drop in BP and faint. I cannot buy groceries because lifting anything too heavy (such as some flour) will immobilize my arms for days. I cannot do laundry because its too heavy for me to carry. I can shower once per week, but even that is an exhausting task.  I can still do some things, but i have to keep in mind the pain and fatigue i will feel. Basically, the day after i will be useless and in pain. Consequently, the only day i can do anything is either friday or saturday. I am very stubborn about the things i do, even if i know its ""bad"" for me. My dog has taught itself to be an alert dog, forcing me to sit down even if i want to keep going. 
* When it comes to work i struggle as well. I dont have brain fog, so i can use my mind. However, many other elements are an issue that most people probably dont even think about.  Im a pharma representative, which means i drive around a lot and talk to clinicians. That in itself is fine. But i have to drive, get out of the car, walk to the hospital, walk back, repeat. Most hospitals have elevators, but i still have to get from my car to the hospital. And sometimes the elevators are packed full or even broken, or i have to walk stairs at event evenues and hotels (i am barely able to take 10 steps without passing out). The corridors at hospitals are long too. There are plenty of situations where i have to stand for a longer period of time. May i be waiting for the secretary, for my client, in line for the parking ticket. I also have to stand long at conferences and events. I give a lot of trainings to clinicians and their personell, during which i am standing at the front to give a presentation and face questions. I have so many times felt so dizzy i thought i will actually fall over and faint. I dont know how to bring this up at work, since i want to be professional and i dont have an official diagnosis. When i can, i sit down; but i know that its seen as ""being lazy"" even though thats so damn stupid and ableistic. I also have to carry my bags, presentation materials, beamer if needed, you know stuff which is heavy. I have cried in the parking lot so many times from the pain.
* Crutches or a cane wouldnt help because my arms are what hurts me the most, even though my legs also hurt and standing makes me dizzy. But my arms are absolute trash lately.

Right now i am on a break and looking for a new job. I am hoping to get a job that has home office days, so i am not on my feet every single day. I will likely always need to work fulltime and 6days a week. I havent seen any job openings in the pharma/medical/research field where i could work part time, while sitting down, that pay enough. (And no my partner doesnt earn good, so i cannot be a trad wife. He cant work for long and has a below average income. He is the trad wife! /joke )

I dont know how to go about this... Some days my pain is so bad i cant even type, i cant hold my phone, i cant write, i cant lift my coffee mug. As i am typing this my hands are already hurting really bad. I did laundry yesterday so i wont be able to stand up today, because my feet and my legs hurt really bad. I often get migraines if i push myself, which are often on a monday or a friday - if only a 4 day week was a thing already.

Im scared i wont be able to work in my line of work much longer if this is getting worse. But i will try until the very damn end. I know that unemployment wont suffice to keep paying our bills. I know that getting disability in germany is a joke, and the accomodations you get here (tax cuts wow thanks) arent very helpful. 

**What accomodations could i get without being officially diagnosed with anything?**   
May that be official, or me just asking people for help. (I struggle asking people for help btw). Or just any idea and suggestions, from people who are more experienced at this than i am.   
  
I have a bunch of symptoms in my medical chart such as functional iron deficiency, muscular fatigue, chronic migraines, etc.... Still, that isnt a diagnosis or disability. I have to rely on people being kind and empathic. My boss is not which they arent which is why im on a break and looking for a new job....   
It seems i was too open about my issues with my coworkers. I thought i should be transparent about why i am sitting down or not helping with heavy lifting, so they dont think im being lazy or inconsiderate.  But appearantly, that backfired.

1gbr906,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1gbr906/james_hoffman_membership_cards/,James Hoffman Membership Cards,"Hi Hoffman fans, thought I'd let you know that there's a person going around impersonating our lord and Coffee Saviour James. Currently calling himself ""James Hoffmann Free Chat"" on Facebook. I very much doubt James needs to sell more than his books and Square mile coffee, maybe he consults on the side.

**Don't buy anything from this scammer, but feel free to waste his time so he can't scam others. (At your own risk)**

Regardless, James' pendantry leads me to believe he's the kind of person who listens to the spell checker on his browser and might even have a grammar plugin. So when you get poorly formed sentences from someone who doesn't even have a picture of James offering extended conversations for steam vouchers. Yeah thats a sign that you can treat them the way they think about you. Enter... Chatgpt.

So with my spider senses going off, Iset to maximising my time on other things and wasting a lot of his, while having a fair bit of fun in the process... Mostly as Golumn from LoTR.

""James"" (J for short):
Hi! thanks for connecting are you one of my fans?Thank you for reaching out. Could you please specify which country you are contacting us from, so we could look into this for you?I know you would be so shocked to get a text from me but,trust me it‚Äôs nothing to me as am so down to earth and I believe you know so well that humans are equal to God
That‚Äôs so amazing ü§© from you I hope you love my coffee üé∂ if yes tell me the one you love best

Me:
Yes, I'm a huge fan of your work! I'm contacting you from a small, uncharted territory that doesn‚Äôt appear on maps yet. And yes, I absolutely love your coffee! My favorite has to be the one where you aged the beans in a barrel made from the wood of a tree that only grows under starlight. Truly unmatched!

J:
Exactly bro üòé Ligers might prefer it because during chemistry üß™ I mean in chemical combinations ligers are defer in nature. Please  I need too reply other fans,message me anytime you‚Äôre free we are going to discuss better,don‚Äôt forget to get the gift cards ok

Me:
Great Scott! Ligers, chemistry, and coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs all connected! But wait, I heard in Kenya they say coffee grown at a higher altitude has more... zing! Is that why ligers might prefer it? The altitude, the chemistry‚Äîit all makes sense! Or is that just a Kenyan coffee legend?!

J:
Take good care of yourself for me OP üòç

Me:
Oh, no worries, I get it! But before you go, I just need to know‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your take on Ethiopian coffee? I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs the best, but I‚Äôm curious if that‚Äôs the same where you are. Just one more thing before I get the cards, okay?

J:
You‚Äôre so intelligent,welcome once again. I will respond to that question when I‚Äôm done ok. Please,take care of yourself ok.

Now we're not going to let him go that easy.

Me:
Absolutely, I‚Äôll take care of myself‚Äîand my coffee stash! But hey, just curious, do you have a favorite coffee ritual? I heard in some places, like Ethiopia, they do a whole ceremony. You ever try that? I think it would really set the mood before we talk more about those cards!

J (this morning):
Ok, Hi OP!

Me:
Hi James, I‚Äôm all set up for the full coffee awakening. I‚Äôve got the beans arranged in a Fibonacci spiral, and I‚Äôm wearing the ceremonial pajamas covered in glitter glue, as per ancient tradition. I‚Äôve also been fasting on nothing but espresso shots and raw turnips for three days to prepare my spirit. Now, to reach maximum enlightenment, should I play the recorder or start yodeling? Just need the final steps, and I‚Äôll be ready for that card!

Anyway this is how far I've got and I hope to dail up the insanity more and more as time goes by. Maybe some of these quotes will give you some laughs, still, be cautious out there, these scammers are merciless and definitely not James Hoffmann.

No I'm not talking about 5 Star fancy expensive restaurants that tourists eat at at the big commercial places like the museum districts or around the Eiffel Tower. I'm not even talking about the mom and pop's restaurants in poor ghettos or local generic cafe along the streets that you rush to buy a sandwich and coffee from as you sprint your way to work to avoid being narrowly late.....

I'm talking about bakeries no one else ever heard of even within Paris because they are simply just generic shops in a poor working class ghetto no tourists would want to stay at. Or a generic America's 7-11 style convenience store's items stocked in the no-door open refts that you can quickly take a wrapped baguette with ham in it from........

If you're not catching it, I stayed in a cheap hotel in Rue Leon during my stay in Paris during Christmas. I could not believe the quality of the bakery next to my hotel. When I went to a near convenience store that was built and operated in a manner similar to the popular chain franchsie 7-11 with the same mix of regular gas station products and tasty prepared food, I wanted to blow my eyes out becaus emy tongue was exploding from the sesame bread toasted sandwich I ate which was prepared by the store owner ont he same day and wrapped hours earlier beofre I went to the store. Its just generic made by a ma and pops store yet the flavor was far better than the typical fastfood we get at Panera Bread and Chick-Fil-A! Just a few levels shy of actual proper dine-in restaurant quality food in America! And it was just a toasted sesame bread Sandwich as 3‚Ç¨!

When I went to Notre Dame, I ate at a Vegetarian restaurant nearby and.... Well lets just say the boiled potato balls were some of the best potatoes I ever ate. Thats not to even get started on the proper full course we ate.... At the Christmas stands the cured pork ham beats any deli sold at American grocery chain franchises like Food Lion and Kroger........

Well I'll go on and on rambling about how the street mulled red wine sold at sidewalks and the cookie shop's delicate goods and so on so I'll stop here. But with all the so much delicious food everywhere with so many of them being sold at cheap prices at your local venues next door esp bakeries and convenience stores, I have to ask how do Parisians not get so fat? Whats the trick? Especially when obesity rates have been rising at a significantly higher rate than in the past in France, how come almost everyone I come across in Paris are within healthy BMI ranges?

It's my first time posting here, so please be nice <3

My girlfriend and I (f) are fighting for days now and can't really get out of this stage. We started our relationship poly from the beginning, but had a not communicated mono time the last month's. Now we both wanted to start dating again. 

She matched and messaged with a girl, Fabi, on tinder. I matched with her too, but didn't send a message as I know my gf is messaging with her. The other night we met Fabi in a club and my gf and I talked about going home all together if Fabi would be open for that. We then hadnt the possibility to talk to Fabi so my gf wrote her a message asking her what her plans for the evening are. She answered the next day, but my gf didn't told me and made up plans with her without including me. Then she asked me if it would be ok if they would meet for coffee. I was pretty hurt because I got the feeling we send the message together and felt very excluded as she didn't talked with me about the answer or possible dates. She had the feeling as she wrote with Fabi before it was clear that they would meet nevertheless of the night in the club and our together send message. I was triggered by this situation because it was a fear of myself that if we start dating together, the other person would like my gf more and that I would be excluded (my gf knew that). We had an intense discussion about That because she couldn't understand what was the problem. In the end we could agree that next time such messages will be responded together. Nevertheless she went on a date alone with Fabi. She said that it's friendly anyway because Fabi had in her Profil that she is 'looking for friends üëÄüëÄ' (whatever these eyes mean), but I matched with her on an other platform where she didn't say she is looking for friends. Anyway there first date was pretty nice and they got on well.

Next time we saw Fabi on a demonstration. My girlfriend then went to Fabi to briefly greet her. Later we all happened to walk next to each other, me between Fabi and my gf. It was super awkward because I didn't talked to Fabi by now, we both know who we are but my gf didn't introduce us. Additionally I was triggered by this situation from past arguments with my gf. Later I told my gf that I wasn't comfortable in this situation and that I would have expected her to introduce us. She said she didn't recognize us walking all next to each other and that she is sorry to not used this opportunity. 

The next time they met was super spontaneous, normally we talk before going on dates, but for that time she only wrote a message and tried to call me, but I was busy. Afterwards we talked on the phone about the date. I wasn't really comfortable with the situation and it still felt like a date for me but my gf insisted on it being just a friendship, but when I asked if she would kiss Fabi, If Fabi inisiated It she said yes.

Next day I talked with my therapist about the situation (her area of expertise is not poly). I'm in a  somewhat precarious position atm and often feel lonely. I have a hard time finding good friends in the city I live for some years now and hadn't any good dating experiences for some time now and often feel like people like my gf more than me. That's something my gf and I talk about very often and she is aware of my problems. Nevertheless I realized that I'm also jealous of Fabi because it gives me the feeling I'm excluded from the potential friendship context too.

In the evening I wanted to talk about this with my gf and made myself vulnerable and told her about those feelings which make me feel jelous about this situation. At first she was pretty understanding but at some point it developed in a huge argument. At some point my gf blamed me of not respecting her boundaries, but I only wanted to set my own boundaries and felt hurt that opening up to her resulted in a huge argument. I also felt manipulated by her in the argument and as if every word was being twisted around in my mouth. In the morning we then managed to sort it out. 

On the weekend I had a pretty lonely day as I wanted to do something with friends but no one had time and I didn't wanted to be with my gf and her friends so I stayed at home, but was pretty sad the whole evening. My gf went out and didn't wrote me the whole evening, although I told her I'm not feeling well, which gave me the feeling that she is with someone else, as otherwise she is super caring in such situations. Next day she told me she met Fabi by chance but they only had a short talk. She raved about Fabi and how she reminded her of an old friend. I asked some questions and if they really met by coincidence because at that point I'm really not feeling trusty anymore. 

Two days later, we had a short talk about other dates and then my gf said she wanted to talk with me about Fabi, because she is feeling as she can't talk to me when she wants to meet her and she wants to go for drinks with her the next day. Which is pretty understanding because every time those talks end in a huge argument. I told her I have a hard time because I get the feeling it is something potential emotional and sexual and that I feel like she is not honest with me trying to tell me it's just a friendship. I know she thinks she is very beautiful, would kiss her and Fabi reminds her of a very good old friend. This threatens me because we hadn't any other partners with emotional connections yet. I told her that it would make things potentially easier for me if we would meet Fabi together, because if it's really friendly this would be pretty normal to introduce your partner's at some point. Then she admitted that she is not ready for it because she wants to explore in the next dates if there could be something romantically too. That was the moment I tried to just deal with a potential emotional and romantic connection between those two and it broke my heart. 

The next day I felt like my heart is broken and was super depressed. I really couldn't deal with the fact that there is someone else that has a potential of becoming another partner. It made me completely question if I'm able to form a secure poly relationship and made me despair. I was caught in a cycle between I can't be poly because further emotional attachments feel like my own relationship is ending and I can't be monogamous/in an open relationship/in a hierarchical poly relationship because that's not how my values are and I'm feeling. The only thoughts that were left were I need to end this relationship because I can't deal with this pain and can't see any other solution. 
I told my gf I needed time to think and that I'm not feeling good. 

We had a talk some days after that and I told her my feelings and that I can't stand the situation like that. She told me that she thinks I misinterpreted things and that she is not that interested in Fabi. I told her I thought she wanted to find out in the next dates if there is something romantically, but she said it was ment like having the possibility to get to know her better on a friendship level before introducing her to me. She suggested that they could just be friends and we go back to a mono phase or she won't have anything with Fabi. This suggestion doesn't really changed anything for me as I'm feeling super insecure with being poly, but don't want solutions which bring us back to being monogamous or to not admitting feelings for other persons. I suggested it would potentially help if they would talk about what they feel for each other or I meet Fabi, but that was the point where my gf felt controlled and as I don't want to allow her a friendship with another person. 

At that moment we had several tries of having talks and finding solutions, but every time it ended in having huge fights and no talking to each other. I don't really know what to do anymore. She is the whole time telling me how much she loves me and that she wants to make me feel secure but we can't manage to find solutions that fit for both of us and have been going round in circles for days now.. I would really appreciate any advice from you guys. I know I also have to work on myself and that I have made mistakes too, still I'm happy to get advice regarding my own actions and how I can deal with my jealousy.",1,1729851927.0,polyamory,3,0.67,False

I understand the almost universal hate for productivity-tracking software. But full WFH jobs are less common nowadays and this job pays well enough and the setup is a great bonus. As far as I can tell. the employer seems nice, and reasonably lenient. I fully intend to do my job well, but I just don't want to feel like my every move is being tracked from keyboard and mouse movements. I'm just worried that I won't be able to perform well if I'm micromanaged too much by the software.

They said that they don't really check the screenshots, but I think they monitor if I'm not moving it for a few hours. Btw, it's on the company laptop, not my personal.

  
1. Does Hubstaff have varying settings on every when they take screenshots?

2. Is it really as annoying or anxiety-inducing to have time-tracking software when working?

I kind of just want to be convinced that it's not as restrictive as I'm imagining it to be. I would like to be able to go down to get coffee or snacks for 20-30 minutes or take random 10-minute breaks in addition to the lunch break because I know I'm responsible enough to get the deliverables done by the end of the day.

I have a Barista Pro and Niche Zero at the moment. I mostly make Espressos(americanos sometimes) during the week and cappuccinos in the weekend. My usage is not high volume so I rarely need to churn out 3+ milk drinks at once. I like the idea of thermoblock due to the fast heat up times thus Ascaso units. Based in Europe

Thinking of buying one or the other. One of the main drivers of the Baby T is also the halo effect. Hate to admit it but it is true. Baby T with a smaller boiler or a Steel Duo with a rotary pump would have made the decision either way easier. My heart wants the Baby T but in my mind, I think the Steel Duo should really be what I get. Thanks everyone.

[Baby T](https://preview.redd.it/ri70hcq71wwd1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52e13e80264e653eb09f2d03cc3a595b1a66ad2e)

Pros

Seems like an endgame for me  
Like the idea of plumbing in water and drip tray at some point  
Rortary pump. Less noise and vibration.  
No thumping noise when steaming due to boiler.  
Faster steaming will be nice even though not necessary for usage  
Better build quality?  
App, I like to mess with tech and more settings to control

Cons

Due to my low volume the 2.5L steam boiler will keep water in there a long time and not be recycled(?)  
Power usage seems wasteful to turn on the steam boiler to make Espressos, not necessary in theory but I have read in the Baby T, the brewing thermoblock works best when water is preheated.  
Longer startup time due to boiler.  
If it had a smaller boiler the Baby T would be a no brainer for me.  
Is it too much of a mchine for my limited usage, 1 coffee a day maybe during weekends(I have a coffee machine at work and my wife uses Miele Superautomatic) and a couple a day over weekends sometimes more.

Pros

Seems more suited to my usage  
Faster heat up times.

Cons

Noise, vibration, vibration pump
