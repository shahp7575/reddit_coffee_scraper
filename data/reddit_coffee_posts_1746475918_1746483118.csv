1kfoi6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestestgunnitweekend/comments/1kfoi6p/atf_research/,ATF research,"After waiting over 290 days to take possession of my property I was curious as to why ATF Form 4s used to take so long. This is what I found:


The average day for an ATF agent starts with putting away his camera equipment. This is followed by licking his wife clean, cooking her boyfriend a steak and eggs breakfast, letting the engine of his 2011 Chevy volt run for 20 minutes so that the battery will
be charged enough for his trip to work. He listens to a Jocko Willink audiobook on his drive, and upon arrival he cries in the bathroom for 30 minutes before settling down at his desk and watching a documentary on Waco (he just fast forwards to the part with dead women and children and rewatches it over and over). He follows this by working for about 11 minutes, then taking a well deserved break to compare notes about how happy his wife‚Äôs boyfriend makes her with his similarly pathetic friends, while they all enjoy a nice free trade cruelty free coffee with a healthy amount of soy based creamer before he politely excuses himself to sit down for a pee, at which time he realized he has to shit (or as his mother called it before he moved out at 34 years old, make a boom boom) and wiping his ass with a copy of the Constitution. After that he restarts his car to head home. On the way he eagerly calls his wife to see if her boyfriend is still home. The boyfriend answers and informs the ATF agent that he actually never left, and that they need another few hours. Delighted, he goes to the local kill shelter that he volunteers at and spends several hours masturbating to the blissful thought of euthanizing dogs before stopping at the grocery store to pick up more lube and a steak for the morning.",1,1746482989.0,bestestgunnitweekend,0,1.0,False

Recently, I learned about all the rules: ‚Äúwear them at least 22 hours a day for best results,‚Äù ‚Äúonly drink water while wearing them,‚Äù and ‚Äúif you eat or drink anything else, clean and rinse your teeth before putting Invisalign back in.‚Äù

What worries me is how to handle everyday office life with Invisalign without making it awkward or stressful. For example, if a coworker offers me a cookie for their birthday, should I remove my aligners right there in front of everyone? That doesn‚Äôt seem ideal. But going to the bathroom to take them out, coming back to eat, then going back again to clean my teeth and put them back in seems difficult to do casually every time something comes up.

There‚Äôs also the daily coffee break, either in the office or at a nearby caf√©. I assume I can only have water, since hot drinks and anything like coffee or milk could stain or damage the aligners and teeth. Does that mean I‚Äôll need to go to the bathroom every day to take them out before coffee, then brush and rinse and put them back in afterwards, all in a public work bathroom?

Honestly, I feel a bit stressed thinking about spending the next two years either being ‚Äúthe person who only orders water at coffee breaks, no-breakfast‚Äù or constantly excusing myself to the bathroom to clean and rinse in front of coworkers and managers.

1kfo7nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kfo7nf/what_makes_the_nespresso_lattissima_pro_espresso/,What makes the Nespresso Lattissima Pro Espresso Machine review worth considering?,"The Nespresso EN750MB Lattissima Pro Espresso Machine is a product I‚Äôve had the chance to test rigorously in my quest to find the best espresso machine for home use. As someone who adores a good cup of coffee, especially those smooth lattes and frothy cappuccinos, this appliance seemed like it could be the answer to my caffeinated prayers. Spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt disappoint, but it wasn‚Äôt entirely flawless either.

**Sophisticated Design for Enhanced Usability**  
The brushed aluminum exterior of this espresso machine immediately caught my attention the moment I unboxed it. Sleek and modern in silver, it‚Äôs a stunning addition to any kitchen counter. Its compact size‚Äîmeasuring approximately 7.63 x 13.07 x 10.79 inches‚Äîensures it doesn‚Äôt dominate your kitchen space while still offering a premium look. I appreciated the touch-sensitive interface, which gives it a futuristic vibe while being incredibly intuitive for operation. The touchscreen is simple to navigate, making it a breeze to create a variety of beverages with minimum fuss.  

For added convenience, the milk container is removable, aiding easy refrigeration. I found this especially beneficial in reducing daily cleaning needs, which inevitably becomes a chore with espresso machines. Despite its sturdy 12.6 lbs weight hinting at premium build quality, it‚Äôs still light enough if you need to reposition it.

**Intuitive Operations and Versatility**  
I‚Äôll admit that I was skeptical about the one-touch simplicity Nespresso promises, but the machine delivered beyond expectations. All it takes is a push of a button to whip up lattes, macchiatos, or cappuccinos in seconds. As someone juggling a tight schedule, its fully automated operation was a saving grace for my mornings.   

The inclusion of six pre-programmed beverage options (Ristretto, Espresso, Lungo, Cappuccino, Latte Macchiato, and even hot water for teas or Americanos) ensures it caters to a wide variety of needs. The 19-bar high-pressure pump extracts a rich espresso every single time, bringing out full-bodied flavors in every cup. During my testing, I used both original Nespresso capsules and a few third-party options, and the results were consistent throughout. However, I do wish it came with an option for freshly ground beans for those days I crave experimenting.  

[Check Nespresso EN750MB cost on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00hqxjy7e/)

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Seamless one-touch operation simplifies morning routines.  
- Compact and premium brushed aluminum design upgrades any counter.  
- Integrated milk frother creates a perfect foam layer, adjustable for taste.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Frothed milk temperature runs on the cooler side; reheating may be required for piping hot drinks.  
- Limited compatibility with other coffee forms like ground coffee or beans.  
- Pods, although convenient, may not be budget-friendly for heavy daily use.  

**Advanced Milk Frothing Excellence**  
The De'Longhi Automatic Cappuccino System included with this model deserves a separate commendation. I rarely find machines where frothing is this precise. The adjustable levels for milk froth ensure you can tailor the texture to match your tastes‚Äîbe it light and airy foam for a cappuccino or denser layers for a latte macchiato. That said, the milk wasn‚Äôt as hot as I liked it to be. I tried various types of milk, including skimmed and semi-skimmed variants, and although the froth results were consistent, reheating the drink in the microwave was occasionally necessary.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this model to something like the Breville Bambino Plus or Saeco PicoBaristo, the Lattissima Pro offers superior user-friendliness with its simple touch interface. However, machines like the Bambino allow you to grind your beans fresh and offer better customization. Similarly, the PicoBaristo offers a hotter milk froth, which may be more appealing for those seeking restaurant-grade cappuccinos. Still, where these others demand more manual input, the Lattissima Pro shines in convenience and ease of operation. For those valuing speed, the Nespresso machine edges out ahead‚Äîit‚Äôs a daily lifesaver.  

**True Value Analysis**  
Considering its premium build, seamless operations, and consistent output, the espresso machine leans towards the pricier side of home coffee makers. However, for coffee aficionados looking for caf√©-quality results without stepping out of the house, this is a worthy investment. Of course, its reliance on Nespresso capsules introduces recurring costs, but the convenience and quality justify the expense in my eyes.

You won't like lattafa khamrah qahwa if

-You hate smell of alcohol specifically whiskey
-You don't like strong smells
-Get headache real fast 

I ended up spending money on Lattafa's Khamrah Qahwa based on the reviews I saw on YouTube. Everyone hyped it up as being sexy, hot, rich, and what not. Influenced by all that praise, I bought it‚Äîand the second I sniffed it, I knew it wasn‚Äôt my type. It was way too manly for me. The scent was overly alcoholic, and just one spray lasted about 6‚Äì7 hours on my wrist. I absolutely didn‚Äôt like how it smelled: like whiskey, cinnamon, clove, and lemon. The coffee note was bitter and made the overall scent even more unlikable for me.
I ended up giving it to my boyfriend a few weeks later. Fun fact: he and his friends loved the scent and called it manly‚Äîwhich, to be fair, it definitely is. It suits a man really well and is quite hot in that context. But for me? Ugh, I don‚Äôt know. I definitely regret buying it. I should have gone for one of Lattafa‚Äôs other scents.
That‚Äôs it for my review. We all have different tastes‚Äîmaybe you‚Äôll like this scent while I don‚Äôt. I might end up liking something you won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs just the game of preference.

This happened half a year ago. My father is a former soldier who lost his leg. For as long as I can remember, he has used drugs. When he ran out of money, he often went into withdrawal ‚Äî and when that happened, we all suffered. This event happened after he lost his leg and moved back home.

Before it all started, I had gone on an overnight trip. When I came back, he wasn‚Äôt home. When he returned, we realized he had been in withdrawal for three days (though on the first day it‚Äôs not that obvious because he uses prescription meds). He came back in a terrible state ‚Äî we later found out that the previous night he hadn‚Äôt let anyone sleep and had beaten my mother.

When I got home, he didn‚Äôt talk to me but yelled at everyone else. I admit I can be aggressive, but I held myself together as long as I could. After 4‚Äì5 hours of constant yelling, he went into the kitchen and started screaming at my mom again. I got really scared ‚Äî as you can imagine, there are knives and other sharp objects in there. And it wouldn‚Äôt have been the first time he tried to kill someone ‚Äî to be honest, I think he enjoys it.

I went into the kitchen pretending I wanted to make coffee. We have a lot of tea, but I don‚Äôt drink it and don‚Äôt know much about it. He suddenly accused me of hiding tea from him and called me a greedy animal. I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore and responded ‚Äî not by yelling, but speaking harshly and with swearing. I don‚Äôt remember clearly if he slapped me or just screamed at me, but I lost control and splashed boiling water at him. Honestly, it barely touched him ‚Äî I remember that clearly.

Then he attacked me with his crutches, fists, whatever he could. He broke my arm. And here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing: while he was beating me, he was laughing and shouting things like ‚ÄúDie, bitch‚Äù ‚Äî and more of the same. I know I technically started it, but I can‚Äôt get his face out of my head. It‚Äôs been six months, and I‚Äôm still terrified.

I know our relationship seems ‚Äúnormal‚Äù now, but I also know he takes really strong prescription pills ‚Äî and the money will run out eventually. And when that happens, I know it‚Äôll all happen again.

1kfo24n,https://i.redd.it/o9pvtqi6b1ze1.png,üöÄ So You‚Äôre Building a Starter Ship in 2825?,"*Your cockpit smells like burnt plastic and coffee. Your reactor pings like it‚Äôs haunted. This rustbucket is home.*

In *OtherSpace 2825*, the golden age of sleek corporate cruisers and luxury liners is long gone. After the collapse of interstellar order, what's left are **scavenged, spliced-together survival machines**. Your starter ship isn't a pristine vessel - it's a **patched-up extension of your character‚Äôs desperation, resourcefulness, and grit.**

This post is here to help you design your starter ship like it‚Äôs not just a vehicle, but also a **character in its own right**.

# üí° Design Goals

Every starter ship should:

1. **Tell a story** ‚Äì How did you get this thing? What‚Äôs its past? What‚Äôs *your* relationship with it?
2. **Have quirks** ‚Äì No ship is perfect. What‚Äôs broken? What‚Äôs unreliable? What‚Äôs uniquely *yours*?
3. **Offer play spaces** ‚Äì Each room should invite interaction and potential scenes.
4. **Reflect your crew** ‚Äì Is it military? Civilian? Jury-rigged science lab? Former prison transport?

# üß± Standard Starter Layout: 3‚Äì4 Rooms

For balance and simplicity, most starter ships in *OtherSpace 2825* will consist of:

* **Cockpit/Bridge** ‚Äì Controls, nav systems, pilot seats, duct-taped HUDs.
* **Central Corridor** ‚Äì The spinal hallway; often where repairs, arguments, or emergency patches happen.
* **Cargo Hold or Passenger Cabin** ‚Äì Either for freight, makeshift bunks, or both.
* **Engineering Bay** ‚Äì Reactor access, life support, the holy land of duct tape and profanity.

Some ships might combine functions: a bunkroom *inside* the cargo hold, or a corridor that *doubles* as the engineering crawlspace.

# üß† Questions to Ask When Designing

* **Who owned this ship before you?**
   * Did you inherit it, steal it, salvage it, build it from scrap?
   * Are there old markings, graffiti, or hidden compartments?
* **What‚Äôs** ***wrong*** **with it?**
   * Does the reactor whine in low orbit?
   * Are half the bulkheads from another make/model entirely?
   * Is there a smell no one can track down?
* **What‚Äôs** ***yours*** **about it?**
   * Did you paint flames on the hull?
   * Is there a shrine to a Queen, a mechanoid god, or a plushie from a dead world?
   * Has the ship‚Äôs AI been downgraded to a sarcastic microwave?
* **How does it** ***feel*** **when you‚Äôre aboard?**
   * Cramped and cold?
   * Buzzing with overloaded power conduits?
   * Echoey and full of memories?

# ‚úèÔ∏è Room Design Tips

Each room should feel like a **scene waiting to happen**. Don‚Äôt just describe the walls - describe the **vibe**.

# üõ∏ Cockpit

‚ÄúThe pilot chair is a mismatched rig salvaged from a planetary dropship, still creaking when it turns. A cracked console screen flickers with jumpchart overlays, and someone has scrawled ‚ÄòDO NOT TRUST AUTOPILOT‚Äô in red greasepen across the dash.‚Äù

# üß± Corridor

‚ÄúThe walls are a quilt of panels from different ships: a rusted gold plate next to a matte-black nanopolymer sheet. Wiring snakes along the ceiling in exposed conduits. At least one access panel is missing, revealing sparking guts.‚Äù

# üì¶ Cargo/Bunks

‚ÄúTwo hammocks hang crooked from chain-bolted rings. Between them, a crate marked ‚ÄòFLARE GRENADES ‚Äì DO NOT EAT‚Äô acts as a table. Someone‚Äôs stashed a deck of cards under a cracked oxygen canister.‚Äù

# üîß Engineering

‚ÄúThis is where the magic happens. And by magic, we mean ‚Äòmiracles involving duct tape, chewing gum, and sheer willpower.‚Äô The fusion core hums ominously, and one coolant pipe has been replaced with flexible garden hose.‚Äù

# üé≠ Make Your Ship a Character

A ship in OtherSpace isn‚Äôt just a backdrop. It‚Äôs:

* A **home** ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs leaking.
* A **liability** ‚Äî it will let you down at the worst time.
* A **bond** ‚Äî the more you patch it, the more you *own* it.

Give it a **name** with meaning. Something poetic, ironic, or desperate:

* *Threadbare Glory*
* *Last Dividend*
* *The Queen‚Äôs Bones*
* *Rust of Dawn*
* *Probably Fine*

And don‚Äôt forget: over time, you‚Äôll upgrade, modify, or even mourn it. Let it grow with you.

# üß∞ Bonus Prompts for Room Descriptions

Use these to jumpstart creativity:

* ‚ÄúA scorch mark from a past firefight that no one‚Äôs bothered to clean.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA half-disassembled drone that‚Äôs been used as a coat rack for months.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA piece of a door with someone else‚Äôs ship name still etched on it.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA hatch that‚Äôs been welded shut - but you don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA jury-rigged gravity panel that sometimes turns the floor into the ceiling.‚Äù

# üí¨ Final Thoughts

Design your ship with **as much care as your character**. This is where your crew will argue, bleed, hide, and bond. It‚Äôs your **lifeline and your liability**. Whether it‚Äôs sleek or scrap, quiet or loud, your ship will shape your story.

So ask yourself:

Results: I kinda thought this may happen but the sweet liquid that resulted had an almost carmelized mildly vegetal and floral flavor that was completely overpowered by an intense bitterness. I think the length of time at that temperature brought on that bitterness. Reminds me a bit of the astringency of VERY over brewed tea. Not sure if there is any use at all for this... almost feel like it could be a great component in a homemade Bitters or something because it also has a bit of that sake rice sugar flavor you get from amazake. Its not inedible it just is very intense and possibly too bitter for any practical application.

About a year ago, a new barista started working there. She was cute, but very quiet and seemed kind of unfriendly, so neither of us really approached her at first. Michael immediately said he had a crush on her.

After about 7 months, she and Michael finally talked a bit, exchanged IDs, and flirted. A week later, she found out Michael had lied to her about something (not sure what exactly), and told him she wasn't interested in a relationship. Michael got really upset and started trying to make her jealous‚Äîbringing other girls to the caf√©, trash-talking her to others (saying she had a mustache or was too short), but privately admitting he still liked her. He asked her out again a couple times but got rejected each time.

Eventually, our mutual friend Josh (21M) started working at the same caf√© and became friends with her. She later left that job to work at a different caf√©, and Josh kept in touch with her. He started inviting us to hang out with her, and the three of us (me, Josh, and the girl) became very close. Michael was around in the first couple of months, but after he confessed (again) that he still liked her, she cut him off and asked us not to bring him around if she was there.

Over time, I started visiting her at her new job after work. At first, we didn‚Äôt talk much, but gradually we became friends, and I developed feelings for her. She had strong boundaries, so I never made a move or acted flirty, because I didn‚Äôt want her to back away.

Eventually, Josh told me she mentioned liking me. That gave me the courage to start spending more time with her one-on-one. We got closer. Then, at Josh‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs birthday party, she got a bit drunk, rested her head on my shoulder, and I gently held her hand. That night, when I dropped her off, Josh called me and said I was a piece of shit for doing that to Michael‚Äîthat I should‚Äôve ‚Äúshoved her head away.‚Äù

I told him that I genuinely liked her and that it felt right between us. The next day, she and I talked about everything and officially became a couple.

Now, all my friends say I broke the bro code and should break up with her.

Here‚Äôs the thing, though: Michael has been in a relationship with a girl named Tanya for two years, including the entire time he was pursuing this girl. Not only that, but he was also cheating on Tanya with another classmate during that time. Now he‚Äôs saying that this girl was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù and that he would‚Äôve broken up with both girls if she gave him a chance‚Äîand that I‚Äôm the bad guy. All my friends are siding with him.

I simply heard that nuts are good for the brain. And I don't like black coffee. (She offered me both foods in her office)

it also happened in a town. That I was buying some cookies, and there were kids in the store and a cashier said something relating to the existence of the kids, in relation to that of the cookies.

Like, if I wanted to buy the cookies, because (between lines) they represented the kids' existence. I don't know if it was a kind of psychosis. It was in a town with a mentally unstable community of Heim. Due to living in poor conditions and overcrowded.

I don't know if it has to do with the cultural view of the existence in Germany,

where ""I am"" means (I am in a place/ I am a person.

At the same time so some people make a fusion in meaning, and see themselves as part of the surroundings, or objects. Don't know how to explain it. I felt it like some form of psychosis or paranoia.

In Spanish, I am is represented in 2 different concepts. Yo estoy. Yo soy. I am (in a place) I am (as a person)

It also happened that I've read between lines 2 german men discussing about the size of wine bottles that each one brought.

One guy was fat, as the bottle he brought. And the other one was slim as the bottle he brought. As if they were referring to their penises. In front of some ladies. To attract their attention.

So I started seeing a pattern.

It's not all german people. But when it has happened I've have realized it strongly.

I have tried to search online, but I haven't found anything related to those experiences.

And are not the only one. But I don't want to extend this message further.

My whole life in Spain, it was something totally normal to eat whatever you want. But in germany I felt judged.

It's like sometimes they try to imply something related to my sexual orientation even though it doesn't correspond with the reality. Just by the foods I choose to eat.

It's an irony that dish in german has the double meaning. Gericht/Gericht. Like in Law.

Or as I said with the kids, or with the guys

Some try to imply something in relation to the presence/existence of other people around the food/object. Even though they don't belong to the conversation. And are outside the Privatsph√§re.

Can someone else explain me what this is? Or tell me a similar experience they have had to see if it resounds with mine so I can feel less alone about it.

I'm autistic btw. But as I said before in Spain I haven't experienced that before.

First post here. Been reading a lot here but finally felt like sharing, maybe more for just processing it myself. Don't know which subreddit it fits best, as its breakup story, FA attachment, maybe even ex no contact example. 

I (40M) had a short (2-3 months) but intense relationship last winter with a woman (30F) I fell for deeply. We matched on a dating app and instantly clicked‚Äîthousands of messages before our first meeting couple of weeks later. When we finally met, it was electric. Within days we were spending all days and nights together, and quickly labeled it an exclusive relationship. Everything felt magical with her‚Äîconversation, intimacy, connection, chemistry. 

We were very vulnerable with each other early on. I admired her a lot, she's intelligent, warm, passionate. But the cracks showed quickly, especially when things got more serious. She‚Äôd sometimes pull away after very good moments. Once she said things felt ‚Äútoo perfect,‚Äù then left the next day. 

I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening and reacted anxiously, even clingy. She later mentioned attachment styles‚Äîsaid I was clearly anxious and she was avoidant. At the time I didn‚Äôt know what that really meant, but looking back, we were a textbook anxious-avoidant cycle. She‚Äôd shut down or disappear during conflict (sometimes over really small things), and I‚Äôd panic and reach harder, which made things worse. But soon after those avoidant times she started to miss me.  

We‚Äôre also from different cultures, which might‚Äôve added to misunderstandings. One painful pattern was her canceling plans last-minute, which triggered my anxiety (I'm more a planner, she's spontaneous). 

One breakup happened just before a trip she took to her home country. But while there, we reconnected. We had great deep talks, discussed even couples therapy, and she told me she loved me deeply etc. I started to look for therapy for myself around then‚Äîmotivated to save what we had and to understand my patterns. As I started reading more, I came to believe she‚Äôs fearful avoidant‚Äîit matched her push/pull dynamic. And many things between us seemed to be exactly from text books. She even told me she was usually the more anxious one in past relationships, but with me she felt often more avoidant. 

Soon after the previous great talks and love confessions things flipped again. One tiny conflict escalated fast. I tried to stay calm and de-escalate, but it didn‚Äôt work, and she left me again. Few days later we met again and spent a good 24h together. But then she had therapy session, after which she broke up with me again, being really upset. Our relations were always better before therapy than after the sessions. 

Next days I tried texting her, but she wasn't willing to talk. But a week later she invited me for coffee and we had a great evening. And next morning she invited me again for coffee, sounding happy. But before we met, she had therapy. And when we finally met, she came to tell it's all over for good. We still stayed talking for long time in the cafe. 

After that we were not in touch. About a month later, I messaged her with some practical info for her situation, and added a short update about me and saying it would be nice to talk. She responded not wanting to be in touch with me anymore. Soon after, we started to bump into each other randomly‚Äîin a museum (this happened in kinda romantic movie way actually), on the streets. Just greeted each others. 

After one of those encounters (and a month from that previous contact) I mailed her‚Äîsaid my feelings were still there, but I respected her choices. Tried to keep it non-pressuring. She replied quickly, saying the message felt good, and she wanted to meet, but can't make it soon. Later when we tried planning the meetup, her fears came up again and wanted to cancel. Still, she came to our coffee meetup. It was cautious, not like before, but calm. We didn't talk about if staying in touch. 

A week later, I messaged thanking her. A few days later, she called and we talked for an hour. She said no one had ever stayed interested after a breakup like I have (at this point 3 months from breakup). So, I told her I still had romantic feelings, but I didn‚Äôt want to repeat old patterns. If anything happened again, it had to go differently‚Äîslow, intentional, healthy.

That same day, she came over. We cooked, laughed, flirted‚Äîhaving a good time together again. Before leaving, she invited me on a trip to her home country (where she was going the next week), saying she wanted to see how we worked in her environment this time. I was surprised but hopeful. It felt like a second chance, even if too fast at the same. 

I bought the tickets. We kept planning‚Äîshe even talked to her friends and family about it. But a few hours after our last messages, she called. Her tone had changed completely. She cancelled the trip for me, and just said I was ‚Äútoo much emotionally,‚Äù and that she felt manipulated by the messages I had sent after breakup. She said she never wanted contact again.Even to my surprise i managed to stay very calm in the call. After that, she sent me money for the flight and blocked me on everything‚Äîeven on the app she sent the money from. After airline refunded me, i tried to return the money to her, but couldn't. 

Last months I‚Äôve been working hard on myself. Therapy, reading, trying to break my anxious patterns‚Äînot just for this relationship, but in general. I wasn‚Äôt perfect. I sometimes reacted emotionally, especially to disappointment. But I was learning. And in these recent interactions with her, I wasn‚Äôt clingy. I gave space. I didn‚Äôt blow up when plans shifted. I stayed open, even calm.

What hurts is I don‚Äôt know what caused this final shift. Maybe it was just classic FA pattern‚Äîintimacy was getting too close again. Maybe a therapist or friend advised her to cut me off. Maybe I came off as too excited about the trip. I don‚Äôt know. I wish she‚Äôd told me. On the other hand it seems like classic FA, first wanting something a lot, then sudden detachment when things get too real. Like labels in the beginning, and tickets in this last thing.

Even now, I‚Äôm not angry to her. I‚Äôm hurt, confused, sad‚Äîbut not bitter. I still love her. Just wishing to understand what happened. What exactly made her feel this way. I don‚Äôt expect her to come back anymore, this blocking seems so final. But its painful that after months apart, we reconnected for couple of days so well, made some plans and then this complete shut down. Again. 

Well I even got another blow in the same week, as i got fired from my job (without legal reason though). So maybe recovering from this breakup pain is easier now that have some other big issues to worry about, haha.

She THEN says ""Og my gosh, well, there's something I wanted to ask you....I think you're really nice and handsome...(i say she's very pretty in reply)...nd I was wondering if you know, you'd like to get to know each other better over some coffee or something?""

Today, I've had acid reflux for the second half of the day, and diarrhea. I also feel so sleepy, like I could've taken a standing up nap while I was working. I've been regularly eating 3 strips of bacon and 3-4 eggs for breakfast. One or two of Steak and Butter Gals carnivore pancakes with ghee on it. 12oz of 70/30 ground beef for lunch. Using baja gold seasalt. And then I normally eat more eggs and bacon or more ground beef when I get home from work. After I finished my lunch today, I just felt horrible with acid reflux and diarrhea. Also just been excessively sleepy all day.

On weekends, I'll eat the same breakfast, except with beef liver on Saturday. I skip lunch those days, and have either ribeye, pork ribs, brisket, or pork chops for dinner.

I felt amazing the past two weeks, is it normal to go from feeling great to having these issues? I only recently added in ghee to the diet last Wednesday. Is it possible that I just can't tolerate the ghee? I've heard it's safe for people who can't do dairy, but I'm wondering if that's not the case for me. Perhaps too much fat in the diet? Oxalate dumping? Is this just part of the adjustment period?

If the info helps, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, chronic gastritis, duodenitus (if i spelled that right), hiatal hernia, gastric ulcers, and ""ibs"" prior to this diet. I can't seem to gain weight and couldn't eat even the low fodmap diet without feeling sick. That's why I'm so dead set on this diet. It's the only thing I haven't done yet, and it was helping tremendously. I am 5ft 90lbs. I never weighed this little prior to my GI issues.

Also, I drink a cup or two of coffee a day, one to two 16.9oz bottles of water with ultima electrolyte powder, and one to two bottles of Reverse Osmosis water, sometimes adding the baja gold salt to it.

I would love to hear everyone's inputs. No part of me wants to quit this diet. I hadn't felt even remotely healthy in YEARS prior to starting this diet. I feel stronger now, I can actually maneuver a case of water without having to drop it where it goes. Just from 2 weeks of carnivore. And prior to today, I didn't have any GI symptoms aside from the little spout of diarrhea on the second day.",1,1746481298.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 33M, 6‚Äù3, have a good job, live alone in my own place that‚Äôs filled with cool art, furniture and plants. I Drive, go to the gym, have fun hobbies and interests. Have a decent social group. Dress well and in to fashion/appreciating a well put together outfit. I take care of my appearance. I‚Äôm funny and make people laugh. My job is cool and gets me backstage to festivals and gigs and free tickets to most sold out shows. I love making plans - festivals, concerts, holidays, day trips, coffee shops, hikes etc. but I can‚Äôt find a connection with anyone. 

I‚Äôve posted my profile on Reddit and been told by lots of people they‚Äôd swipe yes on me and it‚Äôs a solid profile but I do really badly in my city. If I change locations to London I do a lot better but realistically I can‚Äôt move. 

After my ex of 7 years cheated on me and it took a year to get over, I worked on myself. Had therapy. I‚Äôm in the best place I could possibly be now. 

And all i seem to attract is emotionally unavailable avoidants. I have had a few hook ups and it just feels like I‚Äôve been used as they never want to see me again despite having a fun night. I guess this is what it feels like to be a woman in today‚Äôs dating world. Nobody wants to settle down. This casual dating scene we‚Äôve created absolutely SUCKS. 

Whenever I go out and see couples I always wonder why that guy, and not me. They look simple, the conversations are very basic from overhearing, they don‚Äôt exactly seem fun. And yet I‚Äôm NEVER chosen. I saw a couple today and the guy was overweight, dressed badly and a 5/10 at best and he managed to find love with a very attractive girl. I‚Äôm genuinely cursed at this point and I know that‚Äôs the wrong attitude to have (it‚Äôs not something I take in to dating it‚Äôs just how I‚Äôm feeling right now) but I have to be. I can‚Äôt possibly have such bad luck in dating. 

I went on 42 dates last year (it was a 50/50 split of them not liking me and me not liking them). This year a lot less. I‚Äôve had zero likes on the apps in the last 3 weeks. My self esteem is tanked. I‚Äôve never felt so low. Every time I get a good feeling about it they pull away after 4-5 dates. Or they say sorry but they‚Äôve met someone else. It‚Äôs never me. The last one was 5 dates. She was holding my hand constantly. I was doing thoughtful gestures like she mentioned her favourite biscuit on date 2 so I got them for her on date 4 when she was feeling down. She invited me to stay over twice. Sex multiple times. Then she 180‚Äôd and said dating is too much to think about and she‚Äôs busy with work. Ghosted me. And now she‚Äôs back on the apps üíÄ

I went to 2 in person dating events this year. First one I met someone and we made out and swapped numbers. Set up a date and she ghosted me. Second time didn't meet anyone. 

I just want to be done with it all but not sure how to let it go? I currently fill my time with gym, tennis, writing, learning guitar, hiking, mountain biking, running, walking, seeing friends, going to gigs, drawing, visiting museum exhibits and galleries, journaling, travel. I‚Äôm not sure what else I could be doing as I already feel pretty busy. 

I‚Äôve spent too much time focussed on trying to find a girlfriend and it‚Äôs sapped the life out of me. I genuinely feel the state of the dating scene and dealing with ghosters on apps has changed my personality and made me less fun. I‚Äôm in a cycle of opening the apps 6am before work, swiping until I run out of likes then checking the app every hour for new matches and there never are any. 

Grateful for any help in not letting it be my main focus anymore. 

TLDR: sick of dating and it controlling my life. I‚Äôm out. I just want to stop thinking about trying to find a gf but my brain is keeping me stuck. Looking for advice on how to not let it control and take over my life anymore. ",1,1746481258.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

I was chilling with some friend few days ago, when a girl i was making eye contact whole night in one night club sent me follow request. 
Also i reason i didn‚Äôt approach her that night was because i was flatout drunk.

I accepted it and waited a few days to say hi to her‚Ä¶we started chatting a bit and i asked her if she is going out tonight on saturday, which she said she will. I told her to swing by with her friends by my table if they can‚Äôt find a table for themselves, since that same place we saw each other was very much crowded.
She said she found it somewhere and we kept texting. 

She mentioned that her head hurts a bit and i asked her if she wants to come outside a bit to get some fresh hair, but she said she won‚Äôt leave her friend.(i didn‚Äôt have any bad or sexual intentions, just wanted to come out a bit and get to know each other a bit better)

I threw in a small joke stating i have a handsome friend for her friend, but she just lightly laughed it off and brushed it away stating something like ‚Äúhahaha better not‚Äù
After that i‚Äôve just liked her message and left to the other place and afterwards she texted me asking me why i‚Äôve left so early.

I told her she seems a bit uninterested and antisocial, but she said its because of her headache and the medicine she took for it.
I told her at which club i was and she said she would have came with me if i invited her, but she already went home.

I told her where i live and she told me to swing by her part of the town so we can take a short walk and get to meet each other a bit better.
I went there around 4am and she stepped out of her apartment, we greeted each other and went for a short walk. We talked about lots of things, had quite a natural convo without any awkwardness.

Before we departed i asked her if she is up for a coffee tomorrow which she agreed too.
Failed to mention i was a bit tipsy since it was my birthday that day, but it didn‚Äôt change anything regarding my behaviour.

Day after after i woke up we spoke a bit, and then i asked if we could move the date for some time a bit later into the day, but she said she actually won‚Äôt be able to make it today and it would be for the best to move it for some other day.

I told her that is fine, and that she can let me know whenever she is free. She said she will let me know

So my question here is, should i ask her out again or should i just let go?
I have a feeling i might have not met the expectations and that she just flaked after that and i don‚Äôt want to look desperate

Let me know regarding your thoughts on this and i apologise for this wall of text üòÑ

1kfnkl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kfnkl9/does_the_chulux_qfcm801_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Does the CHULUX QF-CM801 Single Serve Coffee Maker Worth Your Morning Brew Review?,"The CHULUX QF-CM801 Single Serve Coffee Maker quickly became a staple in my kitchen. As someone who‚Äôs constantly on the go and appreciates a fresh cup of coffee without the fuss of brewing an entire pot, this compact coffee machine had intrigued me from the start. Its ability to work with both K-capsules and ground coffee offered versatility I hadn‚Äôt realized I needed. I‚Äôve been using it daily for months now, and while it has its perks, there are a few considerations to keep in mind.

**Sleek and Compact Design**

The first thing that caught my attention was its minimalist, space-saving design. Taking up just 7.48"" x 4.33"" on the counter, it snugly fits into even the most cramped kitchen corners, not to mention office desks or hotel rooms. Its portability makes it an excellent travel companion, especially for those working remotely or frequently taking road trips. I even brought it to an Airbnb during a recent weekend retreat. Lightweight at only 2.31 pounds, packing it up was no trouble at all. However, its slim profile isn‚Äôt for everyone‚Äîespecially if you prefer brewing more than one cup at a time.

**User-Friendly Operation**

What makes this coffee maker a joy to use is its straightforward functionality. The one-key switch operation, coupled with blue indicator lights, delivers coffee within three minutes. There‚Äôs no complex programming required, so even my tech-phobic aunt handled it effortlessly when she was over. I also appreciated the auto shut-off feature; my forgetful tendencies no longer mean I leave appliances running. Beyond coffee, it doubles as a water boiler, perfect for brewing tea or creating hot cocoa‚Äîa convenient touch.

[Check CHULUX QF-CM801 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b010nmmph0/)

**Versatile Brewing Options**

I love variety in my caffeine fix, and this coffee maker impressively accommodates. From standard 1.0 and 2.0 pod coffee capsules to ground coffee, I can pick my poison depending on my mood. To make things better, the machine extracts almost the same water amount you pour in, ensuring each cup is fresh. Its compatibility with taller travel mugs (up to 5.7‚Äù)‚Äîenabled by removing the drip tray‚Äîwas a perk during quick morning commutes. However, I noticed that narrower travel mugs aren‚Äôt as stable on the machine‚Äôs base, which feels like a slight design oversight.

**Benefits**

- Compact and portable, ideal for small spaces, offices, or travel.
- Compatible with both K-cups and ground coffee, catering to personal preferences.
- Auto shut-off function adds a layer of safety‚Äîone less thing to worry about.
- Delivers coffee swiftly within three minutes.
- Easy to clean with removable parts like the drip tray and reusable filter.

**Build Quality and Cleaning**

The stainless steel exterior finish gives it a clean, polished look. Beyond aesthetics, its BPA-free components, including the water tank and piercing needle, ensure a food-safe brewing process. Cleaning has been manageable‚Äîremovable drip trays and a detachable filter mean no unnecessary scrubbing. For a deep clean, running water and vinegar through the system takes care of limescale. While the unit earns points for simplicity, I wish it came with a cleaning brush for the nooks and crannies, as I had to buy one separately.

**Drawbacks**

- Limited brewing capacity restricts it to one cup at a time.
- Narrow travel mugs lack stability on the drip tray base.
- Compact size may translate to less durability over long-term heavy use.

**Competing Brands**

In an increasingly crowded market, this little brewer faces stiff competition. Comparing it to the Keurig K-Mini, I‚Äôd say both share similar minimalistic designs tailored for portability. That said, the CHULUX is quieter and slightly quicker at brewing, making it a better pick for light sleepers like me. The Keurig edges ahead in some areas, offering more color variety and a water reservoir. Another contender, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, has a dual brewing option for both single-serve cups and full pots, but it occupies far more countertop space. What ultimately sets the CHULUX apart is its no-nonsense approach and superior affordability.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Speaking of affordability, this coffee maker punches above its weight. Its straightforward functionality doesn‚Äôt have you paying for unnecessary frills, making it a good balance of practical features and budget-friendliness. While premium brands may offer additional perks, most casual coffee drinkers probably won‚Äôt miss them with an economical option like this.

1kfnju8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfnju8,Final day of the European trip and a quick summary,"First off, thanks to everyone in this group for the kind words in the comments over the past week. Much appreciated.

Dublin Port ‚Äì Cork
Plugged in the car at 22% on the ferry in Cherbourg, unplugged at 89% in Dublin. Plenty to get me home to Cork.
Drive down was uneventful, with a quick stop to release the breakfast coffees from the ship.
Tried to top up in Cashel, but the car wouldn‚Äôt charge. Only realised when I got back to it. Not a big deal as I didn‚Äôt need it, and the car park was full anyway. As we know: ABC (Always Be Charging).

Landed home with all the wine from France and lots of great memories.

Trip summary for the number nerds:
- Total driven: Exactly 4,100km over 10 days (including 2 rest days)
- Total charges: 23
- Average charging time: 9 minutes
- Peak charging speed: 266.4kW at 45% SOC
- Total charging cost: ‚Ç¨364.06 (including ‚Ç¨15 ferry charge)
- Apps used: Porsche App with route planner and on board sat-nav. No other apps

Most charging was with Ionity with one location having faulty chargers and one location I had to wait.
Charging isn‚Äôt really a problem, but it can be annoying. When you‚Äôre stuck in traffic and finally get going again, having to pull in for a charge feels like a bit of a letdown.
That said, in most cases I matched (or was close to) Google Maps‚Äô estimates for an ICE car. I‚Äôm sure I could‚Äôve done fewer charges, but I prefer quick top-ups to longer stops.
Google maps is also how I planned the trip. First rough route was done with Google Maps, completely ignoring charging. I knew roughly the area I wanted to be in on a daily basis and looked for hotels there. Charge planning was done the day before by putting the destination into the app and send it to the car.  That‚Äôs it.

Already looking forward to the next road trip in 2026. Scandinavia and the Pyrenees are currently on the shortlist.

I found out who it was, and I asked him whether he ever had her number or had a crush on her. He told me that he never had her number/had a crush on her, but I didn‚Äôt believe him. I kept asking him, and eventually he told me that he wasn‚Äôt honest with me. I broke down crying because I didn‚Äôt know what to think of him lying to me. I asked him if he had a crush on her and he said he didn‚Äôt and that was all for night one.

The next night, I still had a gut feeling that something was off. My boyfriend had coaching that night, and I did something that I‚Äôm embarrassed of. I looked through his text messages on his laptop and I searched her name. I found old messages between them, including messages where he said seeing her responses gave him dopamine, she sent him a photo of the sunset in which you could see her reflection in her window, he screenshotted it and sent it back to her and said ‚Äúno need to hide the moneymaker,‚Äù used the ‚Äúü•π‚Äù emoji with her a lot (which he never used any emojis in other text message conversations), asked her when her birthday was and said he will have to remember so that he can get her something, said he wanted to buy her iced coffee and cookies, and the last message he sent to her was asking her to go to Italy with him, and that she was always his ‚Äúplan A.‚Äù

When I read those messages, I knew that he had lied to me about having a crush on her, but what surprised me the most was that the last text messages between them was on September 25th, 2022. We met on October 5th, 2022.

Before he finished coaching, I sent him a message asking him if he told me the truth regarding having a crush on her and he said we could talk about it when he got home. He came home, and he ‚Äúswore to me from the bottom of his heart‚Äù that he never had a crush on her, so he lied to me for a second time.

The next day we went on a 45 minute walk together and I was just silent the entire time. When we got back, we laid down in silence for about another 10 minutes to which I asked him about it, he lied to my face again and then said he didn‚Äôt want to say anything that would hurt me, and then told me that he did have a crush on her. I also asked him when they stopped talking, he said before we started university which was another lie and that‚Äôs when I told him that I went through his messages. He also told me that he had a crush on her for about a week or two after he met me, but then his feelings quickly went away for her.

Here‚Äôs my thoughts: It was obvious in their messages that she didn‚Äôt like him back, any time he would try to flirt with her she really blew it off, but it just makes me think that if she did like him back, they would have gotten together and we never would have. That thought just breaks my heart, and the other part of me feels like he just got with me at the time because she didn‚Äôt want him back.

I also have trust issues from the beginning of our relationship, in which the girl I met my boyfriend through (she was my best friend at the time) actually spoke to my boyfriend for about a week and they exchanged photos and stuff, and she also for some reason hated that we were getting together and made weird sexual comments about my boyfriend in front of me even though she was dating someone else at the time. My boyfriend never told me about their time together, which I felt like I should have known considering she was my best friend and he was my boyfriend even if it was in the past. 

Last night (when he finally admitted it to me) was really rough. He cried for about an hour, I didn‚Äôt cry but I sat in silence and I was really angry. Right now, I‚Äôm just so conflicted and my heart hurts. We‚Äôve been together for about two and a half years and he truly is my best friend and I love him so much. I think it hurts so much because I hate thinking that it could have been her (I know it wasn‚Äôt and he‚Äôs with me and that‚Äôs all that matters), but it just hurts so bad and I never in a million years thought that he would ever lie to me. I seriously trust him with my life. I‚Äôve sort of forgiven him, I think he realized how much it truly hurt me but part of me is still hurting.

Do I have a reason to be concerned about my boyfriend‚Äôs actions? Maybe I should just try and move on from this because I am really happy in our relationship but this just threw me off and is weighing heavy on my heart (the lying to my face).",1,1746480427.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1kfndfj,https://i.redd.it/us8vd1a461ze1.jpeg,Finance Reel: Bad Banks,"
Hey finance TV junkies,

So you‚Äôve watched The Wolf twice, binged on Billions, and now you‚Äôre wondering: ‚ÄúWhat if Europeans made a finance show?‚Äù Good news: they did. It‚Äôs called Bad Banks, and it‚Äôs like Billions, but if everyone were OCD and/or passive aggressive. 

What‚Äôs the Deal?
‚Ä¢ Premiered: February 2018
‚Ä¢ Streaming in the US: Hulu (S1)
‚Ä¢ Seasons: 2 (12 episodes total)
‚Ä¢ Language: Mostly German, with sprinkles of French and English. Subtitles mandatory. Dubbing optional.

The Vibe:

Set in Frankfurt (aka the Wall Street of people who say ‚Äúmoreover‚Äù in emails), Bad Banks follows a young banker as she navigates the cutthroat world of European finance ‚Äî where the stakes are high, the moral lines are blurry, and nobody ever spills their coffee. It‚Äôs sleek, stressful, and somehow makes regulatory compliance look‚Ä¶ interesting?

Cast Highlights:

Paula Beer as the protagonist ‚Äî thinks fast, trusts no one, represses everything

Desir√©e Nosbusch as the boss who could kill your career with a nod

Jean-Marc Bar (enough said)

Why You Should Watch:
You‚Äôll walk away thinking, ‚ÄúI could definitely run a Luxembourg fund. Probably.‚Äù

So if you want sharp writing, beautiful people in beautiful offices making morally questionable decisions while speaking multiple languages (because of course they do), Bad Banks is worth a shot. Just be prepared to feel judged by a German screenwriter who doesn‚Äôt know ERISA from a 401(k). ",1,1746480137.0,financereelz,1,1.0,False

So I‚Äôm (M24) moving into my first place by myself, and honestly, I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing when it comes to furnishing.

I‚Äôm moving at the end of the month and will be going from working 80 hours a week to over 100. I know I won‚Äôt be home a lot, but I still want to come back to a place that feels comfortable‚Äîand not like a half-empty shoebox.

I like things simple, clean, and lived-in. I prefer things more minimalist than anything flashy. Good sleep is my top priority, so I‚Äôm mainly focused on getting a¬†**solid couch**¬†(big enough to stretch out or crash on, but not one that eats the whole room) and a¬†**comfortable bed**¬†(not so huge that it dominates the space).

Beyond that... I‚Äôm lost. I want the living room to be functional and chill‚Äîsomewhere I can unwind, but also have a few friends over without it feeling cramped. No clue what to do about layout or what kind of pieces I should be looking for (extra seating? coffee table? rug?).

Really appreciate any help. I‚Äôm just trying to make this place feel like home without losing my mind in the process.

Thanks a ton!

I always wanted to write it out, but never got around to it. I finally did it and thought I'd share the story with everyone. Went a little longer than ai meant for it so if you take the time, thanks.I'm not much of a writer, but hopefully it's decent. This is a true story, even if I'm straining my memory a little bit! Any writing pointers appreciated, and questions welcomed. This is a repost from this morning because the picture wasn't loading for some reason.



**WARTORN CHARIZARD**

¬†
The year was 1999. Life was simple for a 9 year old. We had school during the weekdays, and soccer some evenings. If I wasn‚Äôt at the soccer field, I could be found at the park with my two close friends Brandyn and Amanda ‚Äì just being kids. The park was where I learned a lot of life‚Äôs valuable lessons. ¬†There were a lot of us kids at the park, and we played with them all to a degree but the three of us were the tightest crew of true friends among them. We came from a lower middle class neighboorhood so as much as it wasn‚Äôt what some might view as the ‚Äúghetto‚Äù, the kids definitely weren‚Äôt alright. Amanda was a year older so always the voice of reason and the wisdom we lacked, and Brandyn was 3 years younger, and my ‚Äúapprentice‚Äù as I called him. I taught him so many of those life lessons that I‚Äôd learned on a fast track and he was beyond his years because of it. I even taught him how to pee outside on that land apparently which he thanked me for a few decades later, akwardly enough.

¬†Then it happened. Pokemon. Overnight that‚Äôs all anyone ever cared about anymore. It came into our lives changing the dynamic of everything we did. Pokemon cards were the new currency, and everyone‚Äôs collection became their self-worth. Everyone knew who had which, how many, and how they got them. I know it was an obsession at first, but looking back it resembled more of a widespread addiction. At school, it started getting serious fast. People‚Äôs cards started going missing, and it escalated quickly. You couldn‚Äôt even take your eyes off of your Pokemon cards because if they weren‚Äôt in your pocket, or they were as good as gone. People started playing ‚Äúfor keeps‚Äù. This was a game invented by the sharks because no one had a hot clue how to actually play the game. Atleast not as far as I know. If you played for keeps with the sharks, they essentially knew they were taking your cards. They would use their best Pokemon and promise that you keep him if you won, but they knew that the ‚Äúrules‚Äù would allow them a victory because they just knew how to do the quick math necessary to guaratee themselves a win. ‚ÄúAw shucks, guess I win‚Äù . They were worse than a casino. These situations started degrading into fist fights over Pokemon cards, and the incidents were becoming daily. The worst one I heard was that a kid got stabbed over a Pokemon at the next school over, according to some kids at the park who went there.

¬†

The school cracked down hard. No Pokemon cards at school. This sucked for me because at this point, despite not having a ton of cards that I‚Äôd actually bought ‚Äì I‚Äôd made a lot of nice lateral moves to get myself a nice stack. My parents didn‚Äôt have a lot of money, and didn‚Äôt buy me much but if there was ever the odd reason to get anything it would be a pack of cards. ¬†And no, I wasn‚Äôt apart of any of that other stuff I mentioned above to get this deck. I may have known who did this or that from time to time‚Ä¶ but I was never a thief or a con man. Just a hard nosed negotiator who learned how to leverage what people wanted for a net gain. Despite all of my hard work, now it‚Äôs being taken away from me. ¬†

¬†

What I found out quickly though is that this was bigger than the authorities. We didn‚Äôt stop, and we couldn‚Äôt stop. We just went dark. Before the crack down we could walk the halls slapping our friend in the face with our new holographic Bulbosaur. Now we just needed to show them discreetly. We used to make trades in school line-ups, but now we can make our trades under the structure or in the corner of the school yard. It was prohibition rules, and we were all speaking easy. This was Pokemania.

¬†

Summer break came around and Pokemon continued to be the focal point at the park. Me and my two best friends spent days slinging trades to anyone and everyone, trying to maximize our decks. Ok, maybe Brandyn got ripped off a few times when I wasn‚Äôt around but he was 6 and had no clue what he was doing. It‚Äôs a dog eat dog world out there. Out of the blue I found out that my cousin was moving in to the house next to me. I didn‚Äôt know him very well, but I knew of him and was excited to welcome him to the neighborhood. He was a year younger than me, and when I saw him that first day he had a pink Mohawk. He quickly joined our group of friends and we justifiably called him Pinky.

¬†

Pinky was rough around the edges, and didn‚Äôt have the greatest childhood. He didn‚Äôt know his dad, and his mom was still in her party phase and moved them around a lot. He was a really good guy when you went beyond the first layer and he took to our group pretty quickly. There was friction I‚Äôd need to calm now and again, because he was the epidemy of a straight shooter. ¬†But it was ok. He was an old soul mixed with misguided youth. At the time he knew about Pokemon but he had enough on his plate where he never really took the time get into it. That all changed at the park. One day he convinced his mom to buy him his first pack of cards. I walked with them to the 7-11 a street over and we opened it in the back lane on the walk back. As he opens up the pack I can see something shining red at the front. As I look closer, I realize it‚Äôs a holographic Charizard. I lost my mind, screaming at the top of my lungs in the back lane. Let‚Äôs just say I made sure he understood this was the best Pokemon card he could have ever asked for, especially being the first one he ever owns. ¬†

¬†

I spent days trying to trade for this card. He had a mere handful of cards, and I had a binder full of valuable cards, with a deck to back it up. I wanted him to know the value of this card as not to rip him off ‚Äì but I otherwise knew I had to make a deal for this card. I was going to jumpstart his collection big time with numerous holographics, mid range, low end etc. He could have went from nothing to a chunk of my collection overnight. But this cat wouldn‚Äôt budge. Weeks went by and nothing I offered him was enough. He was making trades off of his other cards and I realized quickly that this guy is a better deal maker than me. He‚Äôs the type of guy that can trade a paper clip and eventually turn it into a car. I was amazed at how well he took to this game.

¬†

A few weeks later I see him in his back yard and he tells me he has to show me something after dinner. We meet up at the park after dinner and HE PULLS OUT A HUGE STACK OF CARDS. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It was as big as mine and he had pulled it off in maybe a month. I needed to see what he had in there, so I take it and right at the front is a Holographic Charizard. This one looks different though. It has a big ugly crease through the middle and it has some wear on it. As my brain is trying to catch up to all of the adrenaline, I catch that this one has the coveted first edition stamp on the side. It‚Äôs a different card. I lose my mind just like I did in the back lane a month earlier. Everyone knows that the only thing better than a holographic charizard, is a 1^(st) edition . He explains that he managed to trade his mint Charizard to another kid, who was willing to give up his bent and weathered one as well as a big stack of great cards in order to get it done. It wasn‚Äôt far from the offer I was giving, but he still had a Charizard under his belt so the deal made sense. That‚Äôs fair logic in my mind, but I was back at it again.

¬†

I spent weeks trying to get him to move it. Remember when I said that I leveraged what people wanted to make a gain? And when I said that he might be better at this than me? Well let‚Äôs just say I was right. We got the deal done, and he made out like a bandit. He officially had more than me and maybe that‚Äôs all he ever wanted. I could tell he was pulling this thing out and letting people hold it, and play with it because the condition was slightly worse than before, but I didn‚Äôt care. I had my own 1^(st) Edition holographic Charizard and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.

¬†

I made sure everyone knew what I had and showed it off any chance I could. It was a big deal to be the only guy around to have this card. Yes it was a little bit beat up, but it was the one card no one else could find. That‚Äôs until one day when I also couldn‚Äôt find it.

¬†

¬†I opened up my collection one evening to take a good look at all my cards and plan my next set of moves. Where my Charizard was usually kept, it was gone. It‚Äôs not common I take it anywhere, but maybe I left it on the coffee table, or in the kitchen? I looked everywhere. I ripped my whole room apart and then the house. Thing is, even when I took it somewhere I learned the valuable lesson early to never leave your cards around. This thing was always in my binder and never out of sight when I was on the move. I would rarely take it out of the binder and only let my closest friends see it out because of how protective I was about it. I couldn‚Äôt understand how it could just vanish like this. I was heartbroken. But then a theory dawned on me.

¬†

The next day at the park I called a meeting with my closest friends Brandyn and Amanda. I‚Äôm not sure where Pinky was, but I recall that he couldn‚Äôt be there for whatever reason. I explained the situation to them, and they were shocked because they knew how much this card meant to me and how well I protected it. Then I ran my theory by them to see if I was over thinking anything.

¬†

You see, I had a friend over the day before I noticed the card missing.¬† His name was Steve and a regular at the park. In fact, he lived in the house right beside the park and if he wasn‚Äôt there, could have very well been looking out his window watching us during this very talk. When I use the word friend, I use it very lightly because we all knew Steve was a bit‚Ä¶ sketchy. He just happened to be at the park as much as us, so we‚Äôd see him damn near every day. For that reason we maybe got together outside of the park a few times a year. ¬†When I had him over, I remember we were hanging out in my room. I had to use the washroom so I left, and when I came back he said he had to get going home and abruptly left. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it at the time, because we all have ‚Äútime limits‚Äù or other things we want to do, so whatever. He was always a bit of ¬†a weird kid, so not really off brand for him.

¬†

When I explained that to my friends, the wisdom of Amanda took over. She was convinced that Steve had to have taken the card. Brandyn loved chaos so he was ready to jump on that theory as well, and wanted his head. Steve had recently broken his bedroom light and a few of Brandyn‚Äôs toys (and one of mine) so he was very much biased. I wanted to see the good in everyone, and kept telling myself there must be another explanation for it. I kept ripping apart new corners of my house every night but at the end of the day, my gut was still telling me that Steve had something to do with it. Unfortunately there was nothing I could really do about it. I‚Äôve been to his house maybe a few times ever, and without laying eyes on it he would never admit to it. I knew I couldn‚Äôt just give up like that though.

¬†

I decided that the obvious place to start was to approach Steve and see if I can catch him slipping. I knew asking him about it directly, or even accusing him of it would just give him every reason to avoid me so I had to be careful. I casually mention to him that I can't find my Charizard anywhere, and how hard I've been trying to find it. He plays dumb, just like I expected but he gave me enough of that subtle nervousness that I was looking for. And just like that, it's on.

¬†

I'm at the drawing board with Brandyn and Amanda trying to hatch something up when it dawned on me. I'm going to smoke him out. My friend Amanda had just gotten a new printer at home, and we needed to learn how to use it fast. With some effort we were able to type up and print out dozens of various ""Missing"" signs with a emphasis on the crease in the middle, and what it meant to me. I even offered a cash reward on some of them to give him an ""out"" that he had maybe hunted it down for the money. Now as much as we would put them all down our street, we made a focus on the area directly around his house. It was painfully obvious that his house was a hot spot. There was a tree somewhat in front of his house and that one got 3 different posters. The next day I noticed they were torn down, while the other ones were mostly in tact. He was feeling the heat. The printer ran hot that day, and they went right back up. We ran through this cat and mouse game a few times before a surprising twist happens.

¬†

Brandyn took it upon himself, and spray painted the side of Steve's dad's car. I had no idea of his intentions to do this, and I doubt he had even planned this whatsoever. The way I understand it is that Brandyn was over there hanging out with Steve and a few other kids after playing at the park, when he took the opportunity to strike. He snuck into the garage and did the deed. This one actually got pretty ugly because the police got involved and Brandyn denied it until he was blue in the face. No one actually witnessed him do it, but all of the kids agreed that it couldn't have been any of them, and Brandyn was the only one who had separated from the group. Someone also said they saw him coming out of the garage, which put him in a very bad spot. I actually liked Steve's dad to be honest, but war is war. Brandyn had learned enough from me at this point, and was able to remain brave in the face of the persecution. Their parents were fighting about it, but he never broke his claim of innocence and they couldn't formally prove that he had done it. A guilty 6 year old couldn't possibly withstand a police interrogation right? The case was closed.

¬†

Weeks went by. I was giving up hope at this point. This was getting out of control and starting to negatively affect my life, and the lives of others. The posters were littering the neighborhood. One evening out of the blue my mother came to my room and says:

¬†

""Hey, I just got off the phone with Danielle (Steve's mom). She said that you've been posting a bunch of signs around her house for your missing pokey-man card?""

¬†

Oh great, here we go. ""Yeah....""

¬†

""Well she said she found it, and that little jerk Steve was the one who took it. She's on her way to return it"".

¬†

I hit the roof. The plan had worked! After a short happy dance, Danielle stormed up to our door apologizing profusely, and visibly angry. Actually it was very angry, to the point where she may have very well beat his ass right before she walked over. Not only did she have my card, but she had a grocery bag filled with his entire collection as well! He lived probably 20 houses down from me and in that moment, at least in my mind - I felt like I could hear him crying. I could feel him crying. While I flipped through my newly found loot, every card I held was a piece of his soul. All of those cards combined were still not as important as my having 1st Edition Charizard back though. It was a moment of glory I'll never forget.

¬†

The card was beaten up further unfortunately, but I was just happy it was home. This card had been places and seen things at this point. This card was just... War Torn.

1kfn5wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1kfn5wa/gerd_lessons_my_15_years_and_counting_with_gerd/,GERD Lessons: My 15 years (and counting) with GERD,"I thought I would share a post on what has/hasn't worked for me in my 15 years with GERD.

I am not a doctor and this is only my experience. What works for me, may not work for you, so please consult with your care team before making any changes in your battle with GERD.

I'm sharing this information in case it helps someone else out there. Hang in there!

**QUICK HISTORY**

I was diagnosed with GERD in 2010 and have had multiple endoscopies to confirm my condition.

My sibling also has GERD. Both of us tried proton pump inhibitors and gained weight on them (even though that isn't a recorded side effect), so I stopped taking them and haven't looked back.

**CURRENT STATE**

I control my GERD through a restrictive diet. I often go weeks without symptoms.

If I experience symptoms, it is usually when I've eaten something where I don't know all the ingredients in advance (such as trying a new restaurant).

When I do experience symptoms, I have things I do to get it back in control (more on that later).

**RESTRICTIVE DIET**

* No alcohol
* No citrus (limes, lemons, grapefruits, etc.) -- this includes foods that contain lemon juice (very common)
* No tomatoes or red sauce (garlic sauce or white sauce on pizza is my friend)
* No foods that contain citric acid (LOTS of foods and drink contain this)
* No food that is a trigger for me (bananas, romaine lettuce) -- this is essentially anything that I've eaten twice or more and had symptoms every time. I keep a mental list of these and avoid them.
* Only eat chocolate occasionally (like two times a week max and never two days in a row)
* Eat on a relatively similar schedule if possible to avoid hunger causing acid buildup.
* Don't overeat. Thinking of a meal as a main item and two sides, have one side as a snack a few hours before a meal instead. I generally try to have no more than 2 items per meal and not a full plate's worth if possible. If I really want to eat a lot of food, I do it at lunch time instead of dinner to give more time before lying down.

**HELPFUL ITEMS**

* Caffeine is supposedly a trigger. I don't believe caffeine is. I believe it is the acid that most caffeinated drinks have that is the problem. I have had success drinking ACID-FREE coffee with milk and PH-balanced water. The brand of coffee I buy is Tyler's, which offers k cups, grounds, and beans.
* Vitamins -- the acid challenges in the tummy make it difficult to get all our nutrients so I take supplements to help counteract that. I choose gel caps for these (and other medications) when possible to make absorption easier.
* Probiotics -- this helps the tummy get good bacteria.
* Electrolytes -- generally helpful but hard to find electrolyte drinks without citric acid (I use Nectar powder packets from Amazon, lots of flavors and tasty). I drink 1 per day, sometimes 2.
* PH-balanced water. I researched which brands of bottled water have a good PH-balance and I only drink those. You can also test them yourself with relatively inexpensive tools on Amazon or wherever.

**SLEEP**

* I don't lie down until at least 3 hours after I last consumed food. This really really helps.
* Generally, sleeping with the upper body slightly elevated helps, but I only do that when I am having recurring symptoms (more than 1 day).
* If I'm having symptoms, I don't lay on my right side because that dumps the acid into my esophagus. I trained myself to sleep on my back and left side when needed since I was predominantly a right-side sleeper.

**OTHER**

* I bend with my knees and crouch to pick things up off the floor because bending straight over can cause the acid to pour into the esophagus (for me at least).
* Similarly, I have to watch what exercises I do. Handstands are not ideal.
* I take note of restaurant meals that don't give me symptoms so that I have a fall back plan of what to eat if I return there or if I am eating there while experiencing symptoms.
* I have an attitude of ""Yes, stuff tastes good, and I wish I could drink orange juice, for example, but it's not worth the pain."" Cutting stuff out is worth it. There's plenty of foods I can have and enjoy without the pain.
* If there's a restaurant out there that offers an item that is particularly good for my GERD, I let them know. Same with products; I notify companies in case they want to use it in there marketing. If I had a dollar for every time a product that was good for my GERD disappeared, I would be rich!

**SYMPTOM RELIEF**

For me, the key is not letting symptoms last for more than a day if I can help it. That way it doesn't turn into a volcano that lasts for weeks.

Here's what I do when I have symptoms:

1. Drink milk and/or eat an apple. This sometimes resolves it or at least makes it so I can rest.
2. Stick to the restrictive diet exclusively until symptoms have been gone for at least 24-48 hours. That means no trying a new restaurant or potluck food I haven't had symptom-free previously. I stick to this even if symptoms have resolved so that I don't start the chain reaction of symptoms for days on end.
3. If the symptoms last for more than 24 hours, I might try a famotidine pill, but if I take that, I also double-up on the electrolytes (2 packets in the same day a couple hours apart). Famotidine and other antacids dehydrate me due to the large amount of water they require to activate.

I haven't had to go past step 3 above. Sometimes it takes 3 to 4 days to get things back on track, but once I do, if I am diligent, the symptoms can be gone for weeks. I have many months where I only experience symptoms maybe a couple days that month, usually because I tried a new food.

If you have any questions about what I've shared, let me know. If I think of something I forgot, I'll edit the OP.",12,1746479624.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

I am new to this community and moving to NM from the east coast with my 3 children and husband. Husband‚Äôs job is in ABQ but we‚Äôve heard horror stories about the city, including from moms who have been held up at gunpoint while pumping gas. While its hard to gauge what is true and what is not, I‚Äôd like to hear from all of you why Santa Fe might be better than Albuquerque, even if it has less things to do for kids. My youngest one is under a year and I just want to maximize peace of mind. 
I realize that this post may spark some controversy ( folks on the abq sub say abq is totally fine and has no problems and Santa Fe is a pretentious pos) but I need the honest truth. 
Husband is willing to commute.

1kfmwlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1kfmwlv/do_books_actually_make_sense_to_any_of_you/,Do books actually make sense to any of you because I am evaporating,"I‚Äôm posting this for clarification to see if this normal for any of you at all or not, because this has always alluded me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an ASD thing, a me thing, a normal thing or a something else thing and I want to know. Anyone here who reads, can you actually picture what happens in books? Because some people say that they do and like‚Ä¶ what!? I love books so much, get absorbed into them so easily, and I can blaze through them in days depending on the size of the book, but I feel like I cant actually understand them. 

They‚Äôre words on paper, and even though I get really interested and absorbed into the story, the actual words‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ everything passes straight through my head. I just can‚Äôt really get what happens in them. I have no internal sense of space or idea how anything looks. I don‚Äôt see the actions or environments or characters or how they act or anything. I read it all in the same internal monologue (unless a character name reminds me of someone from a tv show and I have to physically stop myself from greatly miss-characterising them and reading their dialogue like it‚Äôs the character from that tv show)

It‚Äôs like some blank, empty space in my mind and I feel echoes of how things look,  just on the cusp of‚Ä¶ something, anything, but not enough to put anything together. I remember the characters, their personalities, what they are in relation to the main character. I like some better than others, obviously. The problem is, I can never remember or imagine how they look, how they sound, the height of them compared to another character, how rough or light their voice is, their mannerisms that are mentioned frequently. No matter how many times the author tries to describe things, no matter how good the author is, I just can‚Äôt get this stuff into a picture. 

The way characters look is an actual major problem for me. I‚Äôll be reading a book fine, then be absolutely shocked that a character has, I dunno, black hair and green eyes compared to the fading idea of brown hair and brown eyes I was imagining yet not imagining at the same time, even though the author had said it enough in descriptions of that character.

I feel the emotions in a scene, the tension, but I cannot for the life of me picture an actual scene.

And the actual environment , god I have absolutely no idea whats happening there. I have no internal sense of what anything looks like really, just the fading edge of a memory that‚Äôs there but just not quite, so imagining any enviroment is rocket science to me. I cant even begin to put together what an ally way, street, coffee shop, hospital, house, park, field, looks like, and where the heck the characters are in that place, again, no matter how well it is described. 

I really like action books even though those are the literal worst ones for me to follow. In those, it‚Äôs the most important to know the surroundings, a character‚Äôs physical strengths and weaknesses, where all characters are in a scene, and I physically cannot follow or imagine it. Like, since when was that character there? I had no idea you were doing this on a bridge, why‚Äôd nobody tell me!? (the author literally said it 5 times) What the heck does a kick look like?? How is your elbow there? That character is actually way taller and wider than that other character, what?! Throughout these 20 chapters where his height was mentioned regularly enough, I thought he was like‚Ä¶ not tall.

I do this and yet, I still, for the most part, can follow along the plot of books. I probably should‚Äôve specified I was talking about fiction books, but oh well. If I have to read a non fiction book and it‚Äôs not about something I like or written in a funny/interesting way, I WILL explode. Do not test me on this, I am serious.

I like pretty, descriptive words in books, but I can‚Äôt really put them all together meaningfully in my head. I latch more onto the emotions of characters, because frankly, they require little to no effort to understand. Thing is, when I write myself, I practically ignore my characters emotions and dialogue because that stuff is so difficult to write and focus purely on pretty language, because, well, long words are really fun and what‚Äôs a story if there isn‚Äôt at least one 3 syllable word per sentence! Still, I love books, I sink hours of my life into them daily, and I don‚Äôt ever plan on stopping.

I have no idea if this is just a flaw of books and humans and if people are just exaggerating their understanding of books, or if I‚Äôm actually missing out on understanding books better, because if I am I will be pissed. No, I just am pissed that I can‚Äôt understand books better. I don‚Äôt care if it would have to be some super-human ability if it‚Äôs a normal thing. I love books so much, I DESERVE it.

Yeah, if you got here, thanks for reading this‚Ä¶ ah, it‚Äôs practically a novella at this point. Tell me how it is for you, please! Also sorry this is all so scattered.",6,1746479014.0,evilautism,8,1.0,False
1kfmv76,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kfmv76/my_wife_ended_our_marriage_over_the_phone_after_i/,My wife ended our marriage over the phone after I pushed for clarity. I feel erased.,"We were married, but lived apart for most of our relationship while she pursued her PhD in another city. I live abroad‚Äî8,000 km from home and everyone I know. For years, I supported her emotionally and financially: helping her move, setting up housing, paying for travel, planning trips. I did this while dealing with my own constant crises‚Äîmy father was diagnosed with cancer, my dog died, I was laid off several times, and our apartment flooded. I was also living in a foreign country without a support network.

Her parents never accepted me. They questioned my intentions, withheld support, and made me feel like I was using her for a passport. I kept waiting for her to stand up for us. To set boundaries. She didn‚Äôt. I felt like I had to carry everything and beg for her to meet me there. It was exhausting.

For a while, I lived in her old student apartment with her teenage sister. It was disgusting. I cleaned constantly, shopped for groceries, tried to create order in chaos. Her father dropped off broken furniture he didn‚Äôt want and left it with us, making things worse. When I found a new apartment that I hoped would be our future home, he tried to block the lease transfer because he didn‚Äôt want to be financially responsible for his younger daughter. Bills kept bouncing from my wife‚Äôs account for over a year, even though she hadn‚Äôt lived there. Her sister wouldn‚Äôt transfer them into her own name.

Meanwhile, my family stepped up. My mom gave her a ring for our wedding. My grandmother gave us money to secure a flat. I paid for our elopement. When she visited my family, they covered everything. Her family, in four years, maybe bought me dinner twice. When I first met them‚Äîon her birthday‚Äîher father made me and her friend pay for lunch.

I asked her four months in advance to come visit my family for Christmas in 2023. At the time, my dad was undergoing chemo with a stoma bag for colon cancer. I was worried we wouldn‚Äôt get too many times together with my parents. Her parents refused to board their dog because her dad didn‚Äôt want to pay for it. They expected her to watch the dog. Still, they were indecisive about their travel plans, so I accepted that she couldn‚Äôt come. Then, at the last minute, they cancelled their trip‚Äîand she could come after all, but only because I bought her a terrible last-minute flight.

Through all of this, I was unraveling. I lost 40 kg. I stayed sober for five years. I tried to heal from past abusive relationships. I worked full-time, studied for a master‚Äôs degree, tried to learn the local language. I didn‚Äôt have time to make friends or build community. I struggled with intimacy and being touched. I know she needed more affection and physical presence than I could give.

And I became deeply resentful. I felt like I was doing everything‚Äîholding the relationship up while she stayed passive. I began to criticize her. I criticized her appearance when she wasn‚Äôt taking care of herself. I criticized her interests when they felt immature or disconnected from reality. I criticized her friends and her dynamic with her family when she avoided setting boundaries or taking initiative. I was frustrated that she seemed to live in a bubble of avoidance while I was drowning in logistics, financial stress, and grief. She asked me to stop. I didn‚Äôt. I own that. I was unkind at times, and I regret it. But it didn‚Äôt come from hatred‚Äîit came from desperation. I wanted her to show up. I wanted her to grow up. I didn‚Äôt know how else to express how abandoned I felt.

When she went to Brazil for research this winter, I felt her pull away. I asked if we were okay. She said we were. She told me she loved me.

When she returned from Brazil, we saw each other. That first weekend was awkward, but we had a good time. We were intimate. I apologized and told her I wanted to work on things. I said I took responsibility for the breakdown. I meant it. I tried to be more action-oriented instead of just talking. I sent her a blanket as a small gift‚Äîsomething we always fought over when we shared her tiny one. I wanted to show her I was listening and growing.

She stayed emotionally closed off. She spent weeks with family and friends, clearly trying to figure out what she wanted‚Äîbut she kept telling me she loved me. Meanwhile, I had just lost my job. I was in a mental health crisis. I started self-harming, couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt eat. I drank for the first time in five years. I ended up at the ER for psychiatric help. I was calling my mom just to cry, saying ‚ÄúMommy, help me.‚Äù I‚Äôve never done that in my life. When I told her this, she said I was being too intense, that I was choking and suffocating her. She was totally detached when I said I was at the hospital and to calm down. That everything would be okay.

We were supposed to spend Easter together. But after a three-hour phone call with her mom, she canceled and went to see her parents instead. I told her I couldn‚Äôt take another three weeks of separation. I had only seen her five days in three months. So, we had a virtual date, cooked and watched a movie together. It was nice.

That Easter weekend, I stayed with distant relatives. On Sunday, I asked to talk. She agreed, then delayed the conversation twice. Finally, on Easter Monday, I waited by the phone, heart pounding. She slept in. Had coffee. Eventually we got on a call and she casually told me about her weekend. I was holding back tears.

I asked how she felt about us. She was cold. Detached. She said ‚Äúthe same‚Äù in a flat voice. It felt impersonal and strange. So I called her back on FaceTime.

I said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to ask this‚Ä¶ but do you love me?‚Äù She said no. That she realized in Brazil she wasn‚Äôt in love with me anymore. I asked if she wanted to be with me. She said no. I asked if she wanted to stay married. She said no.

We talked for an hour. Then I had to leave‚Äîmy ride was waiting to take me back into the city.

Later that day, we spoke again. Her answer was still the same: she didn‚Äôt love me, didn‚Äôt want to be with me, didn‚Äôt want to stay married.

I called my parents and said: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt gaslight myself for one more day. If I stay in this pain, I‚Äôll end up in the psych ward.‚Äù They bought me an emergency plane ticket home the next morning.

The next day, she erased me‚Äîdeleted me from social media, disappeared.

Now she‚Äôs out partying like nothing happened. And I‚Äôm here‚Äîback in my home country, humiliated, heartbroken, and trying to understand how a marriage ends like this. How someone says they love you one week and throws you away the next.

I know I wasn‚Äôt perfect. I‚Äôve looked at myself closely. But I loved her. I tried. I carried everything I could. I just don‚Äôt know how to make sense of what happened. It feels like the person I married never really existed. It feels like I was erased.

I haven't even managed to make it out of bed yet today because I'm so miserably sick from eating dinner last night. The nausea is unrelenting. I started hitting my Airo Sport while typing this up as a last resort. It really only takes the edge off but it's so much more effective than Compazine alone. I'd probably be totally bedridden without it today.

That being said, I beat myself up for even using weed at all. My family is extremely conservative and they all detest weed. I can't even tell them that I'm using it. Their response to any conversation about weed is to immediately get angry and shut down. They even forced me to get rid of my dry herb vapes last year (+$800, just thrown away).

Recently, I picked up this Airo Sport because I simply couldn't stand the nausea and pain anymore. I hate having to be sneaky with it but I feel like my family has left me no other choice. The dry herb vapes were so much better but I can't afford to get another one, let alone replace both of them. I don't know if I could hide the smell from my family either even if I could afford one now. Thankfully, the Airo Sport is discreet.

On one hand, I feel very fortunate to have finally landed an interview tomorrow and another one on Wednesday after nearly half a year of unemployment and shooting application after application into the abyss. On the other hand, I'm insanely stressed instead of being excited. I lost my last job due to my health issues. It was on site and I just couldn't manage it physically. I've started worrying about being able to work remotely which is what these two opportunities are. I was actually just speaking with my doctor about the job opportunities last week. He was upbeat as usual but we also discussed how even remote work will be very challenging for me due to the severity of my health issues.

I feel like my health issues have essentially robbed me of a normal life. I hate that I'm living at home at thirty-one. I feel like a loser and I have very little privacy. Of course, I also feel very lucky to have a supportive family. I'd definitely be homeless without them. I really hope I can manage to work remotely. I'd like to make them proud. At this point, I feel like a huge disappointment instead.

Sorry that was such a long post! I haven't vented in a long time to anyone about any of this. I'm going to try to get up and make some coffee. It usually wakes my digestive system a little bit. Laxatives make me too sick so I'm basically stuck with a combination of Reglan, coffee, and walking whenever I can to try to promote motility. Hopefully I can manage to get out and walk at least a little bit in spite of feeling so sick. I hope that everyone else suffering from this awful condition is able to do something little to make their day better!

Background: In 2022, I purchased a kit to upgrade my Svartpilen with their Apex 2.0 Stage 4 Motokit. You can see the first few images for what I was purchasing. But after forking over $8,800 and getting the runaround on an email chain for 2+ years, I have only received four wheels. The wheels are nice, but certainly not $8,800 worth (however, he claims these wheels are worth $3,300). You can see the full email chain attached. 

Why didn't I pursue legal action sooner or contact the authorities in France? Good question. I don't really have a great explanation other than 1) he's in the EU, 2) I'm busy 3) international litigation over less than $10K is cost prohibitive, and 4) I thought being understanding would encourage him to give me the products he promised more than lashing out at him would. Lastly, if you think that if I responded and followed through with that last email and would have received something, I have a bridge to sell you.

Why did I trust some French company called Bad Winners and Walid Ben Lamine? He *seemed* quite reputable. The owner has multiple YouTube videos of [how to install the various upgrades](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRi6d2Z_MhOeWD1yR4B8qCDj1qfwWp4ce), there are a few [YouTube videos of folks receiving and installing these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z_6nKNgyDo&pp=ygUUYmFkIHdpbm5lcnMgYXBleCAyLjA%3D), and there's a well shot video of [them giving the upgrade to Charles Leclerc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObntRjRaPjY&pp=ygUZYmFkd2lubmVycyA3MDEgc3ZhcnRwaWxlbg%3D%3D). I even have a [coffee table book ](https://www.amazon.com/Custom-Bike-Life-Passion-Adventures/dp/3832769226)with them featured in it. We can all fall victim to scams.

As of now, Walid (Oualid) Ben Lamine, according to France's BODACC (their version of the CFP and bankruptcy court), has been in bankruptcy and debt proceedings for Bad Winners and MotoVega (his newer startup), owing many people and creditors cash and services for several years now. See the last few images for his court proceedings. 

However, he's still taking new orders on the site. Google does a good job of bringing up relevant Reddit posts so I'm hoping this will warn anyone considering a future order and get the media to notice his issues before putting out another puff piece.

1kfml7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Goldback/comments/1kfml7s/introducing_goldbacks_to_local_businesses_and_how/,Introducing Goldbacks to Local Businesses (and How You Can Too),"Hey everyone, In response to a post u/Vaatia915 made about seeing more discussion about Goldbacks in this forum, I decided to put together this post about what I am doing and discuss ideas that we could all do. I wanted to share some thoughts and experiences on how I‚Äôve started introducing Goldbacks to local businesses in my area‚Äîand maybe give some tips to those of you thinking about doing the same. This is a bit of a passion project for me. I see the value in local trade, sound money, and strengthening community trust. So if you're also someone who wants to see alternatives to fiat currency grow legs in your hometown, stick around and take a read.

What are Goldbacks Anyway?

For those who might not be super familiar, Goldbacks are a voluntary, alternative currency made with real gold embedded in a polymer note. They're beautiful, nearly impossible to counterfeit, and incredibly practical because they come in small, fractional denominations‚Äîstarting as low as 1/2000th of a troy ounce (that's the 1/2 Goldback note). That makes them perfect for everyday trade.

Unlike a gold coin or a bar (which can be hard to spend at the corner coffee shop), Goldbacks are made for actual circulation‚Äîthey‚Äôre spendable gold. Each note has intrinsic value based on the gold content, and there's a live market rate that fluctuates like any other currency‚Äîthis is the exchange rate, which updates daily at [Goldback.com](http://Goldback.com) 

Why Should I Bother with Goldbacks?

There multiple reasons why Goldbacks are worthwhile, including:

Hedge against inflation ‚Äì Fiat currency is losing purchasing power. Goldbacks are made of real gold, which has a history as a vehicle to hedge against inflation.

Support local economies ‚Äì Encouraging people to shop and trade locally strengthens your area, starting a Goldback business network in your area can help promote local, small businesses, and boost your local economy.

Build economic resilience ‚Äì In the event of bank outages or currency instability, barter-friendly communities do better. Let's be honest, the U.S. Dollar is just pretend money, there is nothing backing up its value other than ""the full faith and credit"" of the United States - I prefer to put my faith in something more concrete, like physical gold.

Prepper- and liberty-friendly ‚Äì They‚Äôre a great tool for those looking to reduce dependence on centralized systems, and become an excellent bartering tool in the event of a monetary collapse. 

Getting started with Goldbacks is easy, you just need to buy some Goldback notes, or exchange them as I like to look at it, trading fiat currency for real gold currency. Then began by carrying a few Goldbacks with you when you go out‚Äîwhen you buy coffee, lunch, or even get your car washed, ask: ‚ÄúHey, do you guys ever accept alternative currencies like Goldbacks? They‚Äôre made with actual gold in them.‚Äù

That simple line opens the door to some awesome conversations. Most people are curious, even if they're skeptical. Show them the note, let them feel it, and explain it‚Äôs legal to use voluntarily under barter laws. Don't be pushy‚Äîjust dropped the seed, and be prepared to answer questions they might have, and direct them to more information.

1. Show, don‚Äôt sell. - Literally carry them and use them. Hand one to a server as part of a tip. It‚Äôs a conversation starter every time.

2. Get some local business allies. - Find a couple of liberty-minded or small business owners who might be interested in giving it a try. Buy something from them using a Goldback or two as part of the payment.

3. Use signage. - If a business accepts Goldbacks, help them put up a small sign: ‚ÄúWe Accept Goldbacks ‚Äì Spend Real Gold Here.‚Äù People notice. Tell them about the official Goldback Merchant Directory at [Goldback.com](http://Goldback.com) and encourage them to signup - they get listed for free and receive a cool welcome kit with information and a Goldback note!

4. Offer incentives. - If you own a business, you can offer a slight discount to customers who pay you in Goldbacks. This encourages Goldback usage! Post it on your website that you accept Goldback, and use tools like the [Goldback Exchange Rate plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/goldback-exchange-rate/) if you have a WordPress site to display the current exchange rate. 

5. Host a Goldback Meetup. - Invite people from your town who are curious. Show how Goldbacks work, how to calculate fair exchange value (use the Goldback calculator app from Goldback or the AuSSISTANT app from u/AuSSISTANT), and trade a few in person.

6. Start a local ‚ÄúGoldback Accepted Here‚Äù map. - Google Maps, a shared spreadsheet, or even a Facebook post listing places that accept Goldbacks goes a long way in building legitimacy in your local community.

7. Give them as gifts. - Birthday, wedding, tip for your barber‚Äîpeople love receiving gold. They‚Äôre a classy and unique gift, that could promote further acceptance.

8. Educate. - Print out a one-pager or keep a few cards on you with a short FAQ about what Goldbacks are, how they hold value, and where to get more.

9. Share online. - Document your journey on your town‚Äôs Facebook group, Nextdoor, or Reddit. Say, ‚ÄúJust paid for my coffee with gold today.‚Äù People will be curious and start asking questions, which is a great opportunity to spread the word.

10. Affiliate where you can. - If you‚Äôre buying and recommending Goldbacks often, use an affiliate link when you promote them. You‚Äôll get a small kickback when others order, and it keeps the ecosystem going.

These actions will in turn prompt many different responses, and here are some simply replies, such as:

‚ÄúIs that real gold?‚Äù Yes! It‚Äôs 24k gold, layered in a way that it‚Äôs flexible and durable. Each note holds a known amount of gold by weight.

‚ÄúWhat if the price of gold changes?‚Äù Great question. Like any currency, the value fluctuates, but gold has historically held long-term purchasing power better than fiat. You can check the daily Goldback rate anytime.

‚ÄúHow do I make change?‚Äù Either you round, or you mix with cash, or you build a little stash of various denominations. Many just round to the nearest half or whole Goldback. Point out the use of one of the calculator apps to make this easier!

‚ÄúWhere do I get more?‚Äù Online retailers like Defy the Grid or local coin shops that carry Goldbacks.

Now, imagine your favorite local bakery, coffee shop, or butcher puts up a ‚ÄúGoldbacks Accepted‚Äù sign. You hand them a few Goldbacks and walk out with real food paid for with real gold. The owner posts a picture of your transaction on Instagram or Facebook. Then someone else sees it and asks about accepting them too. Now you‚Äôve got a real circular economy forming. This is how community currency starts‚Äînot top-down, but ground-up, from conversations and real interactions.

This isn‚Äôt just about shiny gold notes‚Äîit‚Äôs about restoring a sense of value, trust, and local resilience to our everyday spending. If you believe in the idea of voluntary exchange, decentralized value, or just being more self-reliant, Goldbacks are a practical and beautiful way to live it out.

Let‚Äôs bring gold back into daily life‚Äîone transaction at a time.

I would love to hear your experiences if you‚Äôve already tried or are doing this. And, I hope this inspires more in depth posts in the forum that goes the extra mile in promotion of Goldback!

We were 23 and 26 at time of meeting, and she had an apartment an hour and 25 minutes away from me. I used to spend weekends there and I would drive the hour and a half drive to work on Monday mornings from her place, and whatever cup I had brought along to drink my morning coffee in, I would pee in it halfway through the drive so I didn‚Äôt have to stop somewhere along the way.  

She found these pee cups multiple times early on and was absolutely repulsed for obvious reasons, so I always tried to clear my car of this stuff before she ever got in.  Sometimes I forgot.  I also crapped in a bag onetime but that's different story.

25 years later we are now married 22 years with college kids and a beautiful house in an upscale neighborhood and it took me forever to break the habit I still carried it on (here).

I have a downstairs home office with a beautiful carved wood desk resting on a large oriental rug, and a nice credenza and I used to have Knick-knacks displayed which we collected from some adventures around the world, and I still peed in cups.  All the time. I'll be on a conference call for work, and either be talking or listening, and I'll grab whatever is there in front of me and pee in it.  Sometimes, it's a drinking glass or cup that my family may use, I just pee in it nevertheless then put it in the dishwasher later to be washed and disinfected. My kids saw this happen a few times when the were younger and freaked out on me big time. Like hollered and flipped out.

And the powder room is like 25 feet away from me, just through a couple of doorways but still, I‚Äôd pee in anything I could find.  A large vase, a candle jar, a planter, onetime I peed in a shoebox because there wasn't anything within reach while I was on the phone.  Its ridiculous.  And my wife and children hate it.  After the call with the shoebox, I had to quickly put that box in the kitchen sink as cardboard is porous.

One time it bit me and I was talking to my wife while working in my home office and I took a drink of what I thought was coffee from that morning but I had already pissed in that. Yes, I choked and spit it immediately back into the cup with pressure washer type speed. She was like ‚Äúok, wow - I can‚Äôt believe you just did that‚Äù. She was shocked, dismayed, and horrified.

And I'm a smart successful guy so I don‚Äôt know why I continue to do this but I do have an enlarged prostate or is that a lame excuse even though it‚Äôs true?

Is this really shitty and self centered/cruel for having continued to piss in my own and our family drinking glasses and mugs, or shouldn‚Äôt it have mattered because they are disinfected and cleaned every time?

I'm a 29-year-old guy from Brazil, and I‚Äôm a bit of a dreamer too. Evenings sometimes feel like lying on a cloud soft, quiet, and a little lonely. I've always hoped to find someone I can truly connect with, not just a soulmate, but a muse, a friend, a real partner in every sense. Someone to build a tiny universe with, whether through shared ideas, creative projects, or simply mutual support. I‚Äôm looking to start as friends and see where things go, allowing a genuine connection to naturally develop into something deeper.

I understand that life can be complicated, and I‚Äôm here to offer my support and be someone who‚Äôs truly present when it counts. I‚Äôm navigating a remote job and unfinished studies, and I carry a strange mix of hope and doubt hope that you‚Äôll show up, and fear that you won‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm not looking to be rescued. I just want someone empathetic, open-hearted, and ready to share something real.

When I bond with someone, I‚Äôm loyal and fully committed. If we build a connection, you can count on me to be there, to listen, and to support you in whatever you need. In return, I‚Äôm hoping for the same: mutual respect, understanding, and shared effort in making the relationship strong. I believe in mutual reciprocity where both partners give and receive love, support, and care equally.

I value honest, close connections, and I‚Äôm hoping to meet a woman who shares that same mindset and is ready to build something meaningful and lasting.

I‚Äôm a nerd by nature. I love tech, science fiction, documentaries, and deep, random topics. Shows like Dark Matter, The Last Kingdom, Star Trek, The Expanse, Stargate, Silo, Farscape, and Foundation are some of my favorites. I used to game and watch anime a lot, and those interests are still part of me. I also listen to Soundtrack and any music that catches my interest.

I live a simple, intentional life. I freelance, I study, and I‚Äôm always trying to grow and improve. I enjoy science and tech content and music that really moves the soul. I‚Äôm a romantic at heart. When there‚Äôs mutual energy and respect, I care deeply and fully.

Lifestyle-wise, I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or do drugs. I like calm vibes, fruit juice, and tea (coffee lovers, you're welcome to keep it all to yourselves). I‚Äôm not religious, but I respect all beliefs. I lean a bit conservative on some views and genuinely value emotional presence, loyalty, and consistency in relationships.

I‚Äôm very talkative once I‚Äôm comfortable and can dive into deep topics for hours. But I‚Äôm also a great listener. If you enjoy meaningful conversation, we‚Äôll probably get along well.

1kfmbw2,https://i.redd.it/0at8xgjmy0ze1.jpeg,Common Sense ‚óá,"Whenever I hear the words ""common sense"" its inevitable not think of the 18th century quote by Voltaire: 

""Common sense is not so common"".

As I struggle daily to literally understand where I'm living; in a society and country that's constantly changing in manners and mentality.

Some might call it ""keeping up with the times"".

At anyrate, our topic today is about common sense and potholes üòÑ.

I live down a road that's physically crumbling by each passing rainfall.  

It takes about 10min to go through 1km of massive potholes that once used to be paved tarmac.

People keep building homes right and left of the road and thus dumping bricks, sand and gravel until it either gets swept by wind or turns into mud after each rainfall.

The motto here seems to be: ""have no mercy for the tarmac"".

Where does common sense come into play ? 

Its simple; if each household were to fix the potholes infront of their homes, you could actually have a smooth ride in and out of the neighbourhood.

It only takes less than a bag of cement; sand and gravel for the mix is available everywhere for free.

That's common sense.

In fact, if only they'd realise the insane damage those potholes cause to their vehicles especially during winter when they're full of rainwater and mud. 

15 minutes of labor and 20 LYD of cement could potentially save you hundreds of Dinars in car repairs.

Its a private road and therefore its not up to the municipality to fix.

Why not hire a bulldozer to level the road; and we could all chip in.  I could do it myself with 450 LYD so-as to drive smoothly in and out of the neighbourhood; but is it fair that ALL those homes wake up one day to find the road leveled for free ?!?

I already take it upon myself to clean the alley I live in; each month or so I'll clear all the weeds on the side of the tarmac and collect all the plastic bottles and coffee cups ( tossed by the same jerk neighbour ) and set them ablaze.  

If I wouldn't do said cleaning; the alley would look like a post apocalyptic dump in a matter of 6 months.  

Neighbours see me cleaning my surroundings but they won't lift a finger to do their share.

I'm a 29-year-old guy from Brazil, and I‚Äôm a bit of a dreamer too. Evenings sometimes feel like lying on a cloud soft, quiet, and a little lonely. I've always hoped to find someone I can truly connect with, not just a soulmate, but a muse, a friend, a real partner in every sense. Someone to build a tiny universe with, whether through shared ideas, creative projects, or simply mutual support. I‚Äôm looking to start as friends and see where things go, allowing a genuine connection to naturally develop into something deeper.

I understand that life can be complicated, and I‚Äôm here to offer my support and be someone who‚Äôs truly present when it counts. I‚Äôm navigating a remote job and unfinished studies, and I carry a strange mix of hope and doubt hope that you‚Äôll show up, and fear that you won‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm not looking to be rescued. I just want someone empathetic, open-hearted, and ready to share something real.

When I bond with someone, I‚Äôm loyal and fully committed. If we build a connection, you can count on me to be there, to listen, and to support you in whatever you need. In return, I‚Äôm hoping for the same: mutual respect, understanding, and shared effort in making the relationship strong. I believe in mutual reciprocity where both partners give and receive love, support, and care equally.

I value honest, close connections, and I‚Äôm hoping to meet a woman who shares that same mindset and is ready to build something meaningful and lasting.

I‚Äôm a nerd by nature. I love tech, science fiction, documentaries, and deep, random topics. Shows like Dark Matter, The Last Kingdom, Star Trek, The Expanse, Stargate, Silo, Farscape, and Foundation are some of my favorites. I used to game and watch anime a lot, and those interests are still part of me. I also listen to Soundtrack and any music that catches my interest.

I live a simple, intentional life. I freelance, I study, and I‚Äôm always trying to grow and improve. I enjoy science and tech content and music that really moves the soul. I‚Äôm a romantic at heart. When there‚Äôs mutual energy and respect, I care deeply and fully.

Lifestyle-wise, I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or do drugs. I like calm vibes, fruit juice, and tea (coffee lovers, you're welcome to keep it all to yourselves). I‚Äôm not religious, but I respect all beliefs. I lean a bit conservative on some views and genuinely value emotional presence, loyalty, and consistency in relationships.

I‚Äôm very talkative once I‚Äôm comfortable and can dive into deep topics for hours. But I‚Äôm also a great listener. If you enjoy meaningful conversation, we‚Äôll probably get along well.

Looking ahead, I‚Äôm working toward starting my own company. Personally, I want to find a monogamous partner to build a peaceful, loving life with maybe a family one day, a cozy home in the city, and a little quiet in the countryside too. And of course, traveling together would be amazing.

1kfm7us,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatioParadise/comments/1kfm7us/evaluate_the_montvoo_outdoor_rug_review_is_it/,Evaluate the MontVoo Outdoor Rug Review Is It Perfect for Your Patio?,"The **MontVoo B0CLP18RZQ Outdoor Rug** has spent the last month adorning the patio, enduring everything from friendly BBQs to the occasional toddler tantrum. This waterproof, reversible, and modern grey mat promises style, functionality, and durability for outdoor living. Here's my honest, head-to-toe analysis after using it daily.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The first thing that caught my attention was its minimalist abstract design combined with a neutral grey color. It complements my patio furniture while not screaming, ""Look at me!"" Unlike a few over-the-top outdoor rugs I‚Äôve tested before, this one manages to stay understated but fresh. The reversible feature is a clever touch. Flipping the rug for a slightly different vibe feels like revamping the whole patio without much effort.  

**Durability Under Real-World Testing**  
I‚Äôve dragged a couple of heavy chairs across it, accidentally spilled coffee on it, and watched my dog's claws dig at it during a particularly enthusiastic play session. Yet, the MontVoo outdoor rug held up consistently well. Made from plastic straw material, its structure is surprisingly resilient while retaining the comfort factor. The UV-resistant coating prevents the dreaded sun-bleaching that‚Äôs ruined many of my previous outdoor rugs.  

**Functionality Under Various Conditions**  
It rained one night unexpectedly, and I left the rug outside. Instead of being a damp nightmare the next morning, it was nearly dry by the time I checked. Its quick-dry and waterproof traits are lifesavers. Plus, cleaning dirt or spilled wine has been gloriously simple‚Äîa quick rinse from the hose or a swipe of a towel does the trick.  

**Check MontVoo B0CLP18RZQ price on Amazon.**

**Comfort and Environmental Impact**  
Despite its sturdy plastic construction, the rug feels surprisingly cushioned underfoot. My children‚Äôs outdoor playdates often result in them lounging on the rug more than running around. Knowing it‚Äôs allergy-friendly and safe for kids and pets adds significant peace of mind. Plus, recycled plastic as a primary material means I‚Äôm making an eco-friendlier choice every time I unroll this rug.  

**Ease of Portability and Storage**  
MontVoo delivers on its promise to be lightweight. I‚Äôve moved it around single-handedly, tossing it in the car when heading for a beach picnic. Rugs larger than 5x8 ft even come with stakes for added stability‚Äîa handy touch for windy days outdoors. The included carrier bag seals the deal, especially for campers or folks who like their patios multipurpose.  

**Advantages**  
- Reversible design provides dual use and versatility.  
- UV protection maintains vibrant color under heavy sunlight.  
- Waterproof and quick-dry features stand up to unpredictable weather.  
- Eco-friendly construction using recycled plastic is a sustainable choice.  
- Easy-to-clean surface makes maintenance frustration-free.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The low weight can make it prone to shifting on very windy days without stakes.  
- Its low pile thickness doesn‚Äôt provide much insulation during chilly days.  
- Not ideal for a completely plush sensation underfoot.  

**Alternative Products**  
While MontVoo‚Äôs outdoor rug impressed me on multiple fronts, I couldn‚Äôt ignore some compelling alternatives. Take the Fab Habitat Cancun Rug, for instance. It offers similar eco-friendly materials and reversible aesthetics but leans heavier toward intricate patterns that some might prefer. The downside with Fab Habitat? It‚Äôs heavier, making transportation less convenient.  
On the other hand, the Balajees USA Outdoor Mat is lighter and comes with free stakes as well. However, durability seems to fall short in comparison, especially when exposed to elements for extended periods.  

What edges MontVoo ahead is its stunning balance: lightweight yet durable, stylish yet economical.

**Value for Money**  
When weighing the features against other outdoor rugs in similar price ranges, MontVoo emerges as a strong contender. The thoughtful construction, reversible functionality, and eco-sensitive materials make it worth the investment for anyone keen on combining durability with style. Its ability to cater to multiple settings‚Äîfrom patios to camping trips‚Äîadds versatility unmatched by many competitors.

1kfm7fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kfm7fw/could_jbl_vibe_100_tws_earbuds_be_your_best/,Could JBL Vibe 100 TWS Earbuds Be Your Best Wireless Music Companion Review?,"The JBL Vibe 100 TWS Black earbuds caught my attention as I was searching for a simple, lightweight, and reliable set of true wireless earbuds to get me through daily commutes, calls, and casual music listening. After using them for several weeks, I feel like I've lived with these earbuds long enough to have a fair take on their performance. Let's talk about this no-frills audio companion and where it truly shines ‚Äî and where it doesn‚Äôt.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the earbuds exude simplicity. There‚Äôs no flashy design or gimmicks ‚Äî just straightforward black earbuds, a charging case, and additional ear tips in three sizes. I found the earbuds' rounded shape fits comfortably in my ears, and this lightweight design meant I could wear them for hours without feeling any fatigue. While the plastic construction doesn‚Äôt scream luxury, it does contribute to their lower weight. The charging case is slim and pocketable, which makes it great for portability, though it doesn‚Äôt feel particularly robust if you're prone to accidentally dropping things.

**Audio Performance: A Punch of Bass**  
The JBL Vibe 100 TWS lives up to its claim of ""JBL Deep Bass Sound."" With its 8mm dynamic drivers, these earbuds produce a balanced sound signature with a punch of bass that‚Äôs satisfying enough for bass lovers, although audiophiles may find some mid-range and treble details a bit overshadowed. For casual music listeners, the bass boost makes pop, hip-hop, and electronic music lively. I put these to work during my gym sessions, and the pumping bass created an engaging backdrop for my workouts.

**Key Benefits**  
- The passive noise cancellation works decently by creating a good seal with the provided ear tips.  
- Dual Connect makes switching calls and music between the left and right earbuds seamless.  
- The Bluetooth connection remains stable (up to 30 feet, as long as you‚Äôre not blocked by walls).  

[Check JBL Vibe 100 TWS Black price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b095j62yqr/)

**Battery Life and Charging**  
JBL promises up to 5 hours of runtime on the earbuds themselves, with an additional 15 hours in the charging case, making for a total of 20 hours. In real use, I often saw around 4.5 hours of playtime before needing a recharge, which matched their advertised claim closely. The charging takes two hours to fully juice the buds and the case, which isn‚Äôt lightning-fast compared to newer competitors, but not a dealbreaker for me.

**Comfort and Ergonomics**  
Comfort was where these earbuds excelled, hands down. I often wear them during long Zoom calls, jogging, or even while doing chores at home. The multiple ear tip sizes made it easy to achieve a snug fit, giving both comfort and decent sound isolation. Their lightweight design also prevents discomfort during extended listening sessions.

**Drawbacks**  
- Lack of water resistance means I won't risk using them in rain or during excessive sweating sessions.  
- There‚Äôs no voice assistant integration, which feels like a missed opportunity for hands-free control.  
- The absence of active noise cancellation (ANC) limits their usability in very noisy environments, like crowded coffee shops or subways.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing these to other similarly priced true wireless earbuds, these come off as a solid contender for those seeking simplicity. For instance, the Soundcore Life P2 offers similar sound quality but tacks on some water resistance and longer total battery life ‚Äî making it better for outdoor and workout enthusiasts. On the flip side, the JBL Vibe 100 TWS feels more lightweight and comfortable for extended listening compared to the sometimes bulkier alternatives like the Skullcandy Dime.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its price point and features, these earbuds strike me as a choice for someone wanting essential audio features without reaching deeper into their wallet. While they're not built for extreme durability or feature-packed with ANC and app customizability, they let you focus on the basics: enjoying music and taking calls wirelessly in comfort.

Its dimensions (17""D x 13""W x 15""H) create a balance between functionality and minimal countertop space usage. I‚Äôve always been impressed with appliances that not only perform well but also look great, and this coffee machine takes the cake. The aluminum exterior resists fingerprints, which is a lifesaver if you‚Äôre as obsessive as I am about keeping your equipment spotless. The Glass Milk Container included is a thoughtful addition, offering both practicality and style for lattes and cappuccinos.  

**User-Friendly Fully Automatic Operation**  
Operating this coffee machine is as straightforward as it gets‚Äîjust tap a few buttons, and you‚Äôre on your way to coffee bliss. The human interface input is intuitive, and whether you‚Äôre making a quick espresso or indulging in an iced coffee, it‚Äôs effortless to navigate. As someone who typically stumbles around before caffeine kicks in, I really appreciate the simplicity. The fully automatic operation not only adjusts to different coffee types but makes cleanup a breeze. While experimenting with various settings for home-brewed specialty drinks, I felt it struck just the right balance between automation and personalization.

**Cold Extraction Technology and Specialty Options**  
What really stands out to me is the cold extraction process. Unlike traditional machines that brew coffee hot and let it cool, this model uses high-pressure cold water for drinks like iced coffee. It‚Äôs a game-changer for summer days when hot beverages feel like a punishment. This feature alone makes the product worth considering if you‚Äôre an iced coffee addict like me. Additionally, the machine offers up to 32 unique beverage options. From cappuccinos to espressos, tailoring drinks to different moods or guests has never been easier. My family and friends were equally amazed when they came over, and we experimented with a variety of specialty settings.  

**Advantages**  
Some features truly elevate the performance of this coffee machine:  
- Cold extraction technology ensures fresher-tasting iced coffee.  
- Equipped with the Intelligent Water System (I.W.S) that detects the water filter.  
- 3D brewing technology ensures consistent water flow through coffee grounds for maximum flavor.  
- Compact yet luxurious, adding a touch of class to any kitchen.  

**Drawbacks**  
However, it‚Äôs not entirely flawless, and there are a few areas where it could improve:  
- The machine's weight‚Äîat 38 pounds‚Äîmakes moving it inconvenient, even for cleaning.  
- Buttons are straightforward but lack tactile feedback, which might bother some users.  
- Price might feel steep if you‚Äôre not heavily invested in specialty coffee drinks.  

**Pluses Compared to Competing Options**  
In comparison with similarly styled super-automatic espresso machines like the De'Longhi Eletta Explore or the Breville Oracle Touch, the Jura Z10 holds its ground admirably. Featuring cold extraction technology, something rivals often skimp on, it creates fresher iced coffee beverages. Moreover, the aluminum build feels more premium compared to machines that rely heavily on plastic components. While the 3D brewing technology stands out for consistent brewing, other machines' adjustable levels seem a tad more beginner-friendly. That said, competitors sometimes offer better price flexibility, which may appeal to a more budget-conscious buyer. Ultimately, though, the Jura Z10 wins hands-down when you prioritize optimal coffee quality and design.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Admittedly, the upfront investment in this coffee maker is not something everyone will consider. It‚Äôs not merely a coffee machine; it‚Äôs a comprehensive brewing system with added premium features like the Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P) and water filter detection capabilities. If you‚Äôre a hardcore coffee enthusiast with a love for specialty drinks, the features justify the cost. Saving trips to your local caf√© eventually balances out the expense over time. That said, those wishing for a simple brew shouldn‚Äôt stretch their budget for this‚Äîthere are more affordable alternatives that suffice for everyday brewing needs.

1kfm05g,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1kfm05g/can_country_farms_super_greens_chocolate_flavor/,Can Country Farms Super Greens Chocolate Flavor Truly Boost Energy and Gut Health Review?,"The Country Farms N9880 Organic Super Greens Chocolate Flavor serves as an intriguing venture into nutrient-packed herbal drink supplements. An everyday addition to my dietary regimen, this powder promised a blend of 50 farm-fresh organic superfoods, offering energy management, gut health enhancement, and antioxidant benefits. Over the last few weeks of integrating this into my morning smoothie routine, I‚Äôve formed some very detailed impressions about this product.

**Taste and Texture Experience**  
Starting with its chocolate flavor, the taste is surprisingly delightful for something loaded with greens like spirulina, wheatgrass, and chlorella. While many superfood supplements can taste earthy or overly grassy, this one balances its health-conscious ingredients with a flavor profile that feels like a mild chocolate milk alternative. However, I did find that its consistency could become slightly gritty if not blended thoroughly. A quick spin in my blender with almond milk and bananas erased this issue entirely, but using a spoon to mix in a rush was less effective.

**Nutritional Benefits and Key Features**  
This mix packs a powerful punch of nutrients, from mushrooms like reishi and lion‚Äôs mane to antioxidant-rich berries. The probiotics and fiber blend truly stand out for gut health. I can honestly say I noticed positive changes in digestion within the first week. Moreover, the alkalizing greens like spirulina and chlorella supposedly help balance pH levels, which aligns with claims of supporting debloating‚Äîthough this effect, in my experience, builds over time rather than showing instant results. For those constantly battling energy slumps, this blend‚Äôs promise of jitter-free natural vitality hit the mark. I swapped my mid-afternoon coffee out for a cup of this, and it kept me alert up until dinner.

[Check COUNTRY FARMS N9880 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b06xv6lwb3/)  

**Packaging and Ease of Use**  
This supplement arrives in a compact plastic container, weighing just under eight ounces, making it easy to store on a crowded kitchen countertop. Opening the jar for the first time, you‚Äôll find a scoop included, which might not excite some people, but it was handy for me. A single serving uses one scoop (about 10.6 grams), so no complex measurements are involved. On busy mornings, mixing the powder took under two minutes. That‚Äôs a notable win in convenience for health-conscious individuals running short on time.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Packed with 50 organic superfoods, providing comprehensive vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.  
- Chocolate flavor significantly masks the inherent bitterness often found in greens.  
- Easy to incorporate into various recipes, from smoothies to oatmeal or even protein pancakes.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The texture occasionally feels gritty, especially when not blended.  
- Some users reported mild bloating when first starting with the mixture, which I can attest to initially before my body adapted.  
- Its chocolate flavor, while pleasant, could feel too mild if you have a strong sweet tooth.  

**Competing Products**  
Exploring alternatives in the crowded super greens market, I tested a few rival products to compare. Athletic Greens offers a comprehensive nutrient profile, though it leans heavily into a grass-like flavor versus chocolate. While it boasts an equally potent antioxidant punch, it lacks the dessert-like appeal brought by the chocolate twist in Country Farms‚Äô blend. Another close contender was Amazing Grass Green Superfood, which also contains powdered greens but delivers a performance better suited for purists rather than flavor-lovers like myself. If taste and digestibility matter, the chocolate-flavored supplement edges past most competitors.

**Quality for Price**  
When contemplating the investment, the product showcases an excellent price-to-quality ratio relative to other similar drinks. Given the balance of ingredients, efficacy in promoting gut health, and ease of blending into daily life, it‚Äôs certainly justified within its pricing bracket. It isn‚Äôt dramatically cheaper or costlier than its peers but manages to stand out by offering taste without compromising efficacy. If affordability and functionality are on your checklist, this supplement delivers.

1kflzj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kflzj2/stuck_in_contempt_but_trying_30f_31m/,"Stuck in contempt but trying (30F, 31M)","We‚Äôve been married for a few years now. We‚Äôve done everything. Books, Gottman research, weekly therapy, even an intensive weekend Gottman counseling retreat. And still, something in me has shifted. After a conflict in December, it was like a switch flipped. I started seeing him differently. I stopped feeling close. And I haven‚Äôt been able to force myself to go back. 

He has for years, baselessly accused me of cheating. I work in a male dominated field and he becomes very suspicious if I‚Äôm even a little late coming home. It has eroded something in me that is hard to explain. He is anxious about everything surrounding me and our relationship. He keeps telling me he‚Äôs just ‚Äúwaiting on the other shoe to drop.‚Äù 

I know marriage takes work. I‚Äôm not afraid of effort. I‚Äôm someone who gets up at 4am to train for marathons. I bake bread from scratch. I play the long game in almost every area of life. So I stayed. I really tried. I read the books cover to cover, I supported him on his journey through therapy. But now I‚Äôm realizing, marriage doesn‚Äôt just require work. It requires friendship. And I don‚Äôt think we have that anymore. 

We don‚Äôt feel like friends. There‚Äôs no ease between us. No play. He often feels morally superior, yet incredibly anxious. That mix has made it feel hard to be myself around him. I feel as though every time I express my needs he feels attacked, because me asking for things in our marriage equates to him being the bad guy. As a result, not much changes. 

He says things like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me, cherish me, or dote on me the way wives should.‚Äù I write him notes and poems about why I love him. I‚Äôm not a prude about sex. I brought him a cup of coffee to wake up to, every morning until about a month ago. I try to do the big and little things to keep us afloat. I have expressed over and over how hurtful it is to hear my love isn‚Äôt enough for him. He tells me it‚Äôs the best thing he‚Äôs ever felt and that he loves me more than anyone in the world, and that no one will ever love me more than him. I don‚Äôt feel his love. I haven‚Äôt felt admired by him. 

There have been some difficult moments. In one instance, at a concert, he got so drunk he blacked out and threw a beer can at me in front of our friends and berated me, telling me he hates me and that I should just fuck off. A few weeks ago, when I tried to talk about separating, he broke things in the house, smashed photos, screamed at me. It‚Äôs not always like that, but when it is, it‚Äôs terrifying. I tell him after the fact and he says he‚Äôs just expressing his anger. He would never hurt me. He‚Äôs since said he‚Äôs in recovery and wants to change. I‚Äôm not sure if he can tell me what he‚Äôs in recovery from. He went on a bachelor trip this weekend and drank. 

The part I keep coming back to: I don‚Äôt know how to overcome this contempt. I don‚Äôt even think I like him anymore. When I sit with the real version of him, not the idea of him, I feel tense, guarded, and very small. I don‚Äôt want to feel this way. I find it very hard to feel comfortable around him. I feel like my skin is going to burst open. 

When I was training, he told me I was using it as an excuse to get away from him, or that I had eyes for other, fitter men. He kept me up until the early hours of the morning night before my race because he was spiraling about me not wanting him to come to the start line, as there were 50,000 people trying to get to the same place and I didn‚Äôt want him to get overwhelmed. I wanted to advance my education and he told me he doesn‚Äôt feel obligated to follow me on my ‚Äúheroes journey‚Äù. And he thinks all my friends are pieces of shit, so as a result, he and our dog are about the only friends I have.  

I don‚Äôt want to live the rest of my life in a house built on performance, guilt, and fear. I used to feel so confident in myself. This past weekend he‚Äôs been away has been so wonderful. I felt so free. My friends who see us interact tell me I should just leave, but that feels like the easy way out. I understand how much work marriage takes. I took us to therapy after he humiliated me in public the first time. I have been in therapy myself to work on my shortcomings. I want friendship. I want peace. I want to feel like myself again.

i hope it‚Äôs okay if i vent here - my family don‚Äôt know about most of this so i just want to be proud of myself publicly but anonymously! for context, i come from a very driven and academic family and i was always told that out of my siblings i was the smartest one who would make them the most proud. when i was 18 i chose to go to law school like they encouraged me to and they told everybody they were going to have a lawyer daughter, but unfortunately in the first 2 months i realised i hated my course and i had no interest in it. i didn‚Äôt drop out because my parents pride means everything to me and they had invested so much into me and my education and i was absolutely terrified of disappointing them. 

i didn‚Äôt tell them how bad it was because for the first 3 years i managed to scrape by with passing grades but in my final year the stress of it all finally caught up to me. i hated the subjects i was studying, i hated the house i lived in because i had been SA‚Äôed there 2 years prior, my housemate who was my best friend and in the same college course as me decided to start making my life hell, i was so broke i could only get food from the reduced aisles every night and i started getting reoccurring nightmares so i couldn‚Äôt sleep a wink. i had undiagnosed ADHD and had recently gone off my anxiety and depression medication after a good summer working abroad and i didn‚Äôt want to admit i needed help again, so i let myself sink into a depression pit where i didn‚Äôt attend lectures and could barely get out of bed to take care of myself. by the time my christmas exams came around, i was so completely overwhelmed by it all and the impending failure (failing exams in my college is a huge process and the ultimate mark of stupidity, especially in law) that i deliberately burned my writing arm so badly i had to go to hospital, but i was able to defer my exams. i thought the summer exams would be better, but by that time my manic depression was so bad i started making active plans to end my life because i couldn‚Äôt see a point in living and i thought the world would be better off without me. 

my friend saved my life. he knew something was wrong so he barged into my room with food and demanded i contacted the mental health services in my college to get my exams deferred and to start counseling ASAP. i had a complete breakdown but i was able to get my exams deferred, called my mum and told her i needed serious help, and to her credit she drove 6 hours immediately to stay with me for the weekend and get me out of the house. i moved back home, told my parents how much i hated my degree, started counseling with a BRILLIANT psychologist, and started new meds. my best friend from home got me a well-paying and fun job to keep me busy while i recovered mentally and after a while i was able to try and study, this time with loads of support and accommodations. the only reason i didn‚Äôt drop out is because im stubborn and wanted something to show for the last few years, i didn‚Äôt want to admit total failure, and because i knew on some level that i could absolutely complete all the exams if i was in a better state of mind. 

Well. After 9 horrible and grueling exams, I just sat my last ever one on Friday. I know I won‚Äôt be failing because I worked my ass off to do as much as I could to make myself proud. I won‚Äôt be getting a first class honours degree, but i‚Äôll get the minimum honor required to do a Masters if i choose to do in the future. i cried so hard walking out of that exam that everyone looked at me like i was crazy, but i am SO PROUD of myself. 

this time last year i was preparing suicide notes and planning who to leave my favourite items to, and struggling with the guilt of leaving my family behind so i could be free. this year, while i‚Äôm behind on all of my peers because im still living at home and working retail when everyone else in my degree is living in big fancy cities working in big fancy firms, but this year im just happy. im happy for the first time in years. life is simple right now. i don‚Äôt wake up in a cold sweat from a dream about an exam i haven‚Äôt prepared for anymore, instead i wake up to my cranky old dog crying for his breakfast and a fresh coffee waiting for me on the table. i‚Äôm earning money and saving up for a car and every so often i dye my hair the way i‚Äôve always wanted to but didn‚Äôt because i didnt want to disappoint my family. i take it day by day and i give myself little treats whenever i feel like it because i have the money to do so. 

the best thing out of this by far is that my relationship with my family has improved massively. i grew up with the weight of being the family overachiever and i was such a people pleaser i did anything they expected of me. after my breakdown, where i sobbed to them about how horribly i felt about myself, they found me a fantastic counselor and listen to me when i tell them how their actions hurt me. they check in when im not my normal bubbly self. they‚Äôll never know how deeply depressed i was and ill never tell them (they think my arm being burnt was a freak accident) but they‚Äôve been incredible to me and im very grateful to have gotten through to them about their strict expectations on me. the funny thing is, they‚Äôre divorced so in a weird way my MH episode brought them back together for a while when i expected them to accuse the other of making me this way (because they have in the past) 

i will be graduating in the next few weeks and i will never have to do this again. i thought i would either be dead or would have dropped out before i ever saw myself in that cap and robe with a diploma in my hand, but ive already started looking for dresses to wear on the day. im soaking in every second of living for as long as i can.",20,1746476743.0,CongratsLikeImFive,3,1.0,False

**1. High-Protein Cookies with Quest Bars**

**2. Protein Zucchini Bread**

‚òï **BARISTA PLUS TECHNOLOGY** ‚Äì Because nothing screams *barista-level* like a machine that sounds like it‚Äôs taking off into orbit just to spit out lukewarm espresso. The ‚Äú19-bar pressure system‚Äù is about as consistent as my willpower on a Monday morning. Sometimes you get a silky crema; other times, you get a shot that tastes like regret and stainless steel.

üí° **Single-Serve Coffee & Nespresso Compatible** ‚Äì Translation: Yes, it *technically* works with Nespresso pods‚Ä¶ until it doesn‚Äôt. If you enjoy rolling the dice every morning and wondering, *‚ÄúWill it brew today, or just blink at me judgmentally?‚Äù* ‚Äî this is the machine for you.

ü•¥ **Built-In Frother** ‚Äì You know what‚Äôs more satisfying than a creamy cappuccino? Watching your built-in frother barely rotate and give up mid-spin like a toddler forced to clean their room. Foam? You mean warm milk bubbles?

üßä **Brew Over Ice?** More like Brew Overwatered. Enjoy that watered-down, lukewarm iced coffee because the machine doesn't understand the concept of cooling things down ‚Äî it just brews hot coffee‚Ä¶ on your ice. Science!

üì¶ **Used Capsule Storage Bin** ‚Äì Holds 20 used capsules, perfect for that moment when you realize you've brewed 20 sad drinks before you questioned your life decisions.

üî• **Keep Warm Function** ‚Äì Sure, it keeps your 12-cup carafe warm‚Ä¶ unless it randomly stops working, as it did for a handful of other lucky buyers. Nothing says ‚Äúgourmet‚Äù like room-temp drip coffee after a 5-minute power nap.

‚úÖ **Bonus Features:**

* Comes *Renewed*! Which means you can enjoy all the quirks of a used machine at only *slightly* less than a new one.
* Paper filter kit? Because who needs a built-in filter in 2025!
* Includes a ‚ÄúNinja Smart Scoop‚Äù which, unlike the rest of the machine, actually does its job.

1kflv64,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kflv64/what_makes_the_baby_trend_range_jogger_stroller_a/,What makes the Baby Trend Range Jogger Stroller a top-rated choice? Review,"The Baby Trend JG99773 Range Jogger Stroller, Millennium, swiftly caught my attention as I was on the hunt for a stroller that could keep up with a busy, fitness-driven lifestyle. This jogging stroller promised a lot‚Äîfrom maneuverability to comfort‚Äîand I was excited to see just how much it could deliver in real-life situations. After spending weeks putting it to the test during daily workouts, weekend strolls, and errands around town, I‚Äôve gathered detailed insights to help you decide if this is the stroller for your family.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The overall build of this stroller is robust without feeling overly bulky, thanks to its alloy steel frame. Its three-wheel design, featuring all-terrain composite tires, makes it sturdy enough to tackle gravel paths and grassy parks while still navigating tight corners in crowded areas. It‚Äôs a little heavier than I‚Äôd anticipated at 12.44 kilograms, but the sturdy construction reassured me that it could uphold safety and stability, which is key for me when jogging with my toddler onboard. The seating area is neatly designed with a durable polyester fabric that feels soft yet tough enough to handle the occasional snack spill or rogue marker.  

The handlebar stood out for its ergonomic, extra-wide shape with rubberized grips. Even during long jogs that pushed my endurance, my hands didn‚Äôt ache or slip, which is hands-down one of my favorite aspects of this stroller's design.

Moving on to portability, the trigger-fold mechanism makes collapsing the stroller surprisingly easy, even when I‚Äôm juggling a coffee cup and diaper bag. However, the folded dimensions of 46""L x 22""W x 41.5""H mean it still takes up a decent chunk of trunk space, something to watch out for if you‚Äôre driving a smaller car.

**Comfort and Safety**  
Nothing matters more than your little one‚Äôs comfort and safety, and this stroller shines in both areas. The seat is padded, reclinable, and comes with a plush 5-point harness that's easy to adjust and keeps my toddler secure without any signs of discomfort. I appreciated the thoughtfulness of the additional padding on the harness, preventing it from digging into her shoulders during extended outings. The canopy is expandable with three tiers and does an excellent job of shielding my child from harsh sunlight, though I did wish it could extend just a tad further for optimal coverage during midday jogs.

Safety features like the footrest reflectors were a clever touch, boosting visibility when we ended up on evening walks around the neighborhood. Coupled with the tether strap and dual rear brakes, I felt confident about the added layers of protection especially during high-speed runs.

[Ready to snag Baby Trend JG99773? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b01fcdwzfc/)

**Highlights**  
- Effortless fold-down mechanism for convenient storage and portability.  
- Multi-position reclinable seat for customized comfort.  
- All-terrain wheels for various jogging surfaces.  
- Expandable, three-tier canopy to block sunlight.  

**Pitfalls**  
Not everything about this jogger stroller is perfect. Here are some aspects that fell short for me:  
- The folded size may not suit small cars or compact storage spaces.  
- While suitable for toddlers, compatibility with an infant car seat (sold separately) could‚Äôve been more seamless.  
- The canopy, though great, may not provide complete shade during peak sunny hours.  

**Ease of Use and Added Convenience**  
The built-in parent tray adds significant convenience whether you‚Äôre walking to the park or grabbing groceries. Between the cup holders and the covered compartment, my coffee and smartphone fit securely, and I could still stash my keys without worry. It even includes a child tray with cup holders, making snack time a breeze. One of the nicest surprises was how the lockable swivel wheel transitions from jogging to strolling. With a quick adjustment, I could swap between modes without breaking stride, which added major points for versatility in my book.

I‚Äôm slightly puzzled by the decision to exclude built-in lights for evening use. Though not a deal-breaker for me, it‚Äôs an addition I‚Äôve seen in other joggers that I missed here.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to some other jogging strollers in its class, the nuances become apparent. The Baby Jogger Summit X3, for instance, offers advanced suspension at a higher price point, but lacks as much onboard storage. On the other hand, the Graco FastAction Jogger includes slightly more compact folding dimensions at the expense of lesser terrain adaptability. Where the Baby Trend Range Jogger excels is its all-around versatility; it provides the essentials at an accessible price. If you‚Äôre not planning on bringing this off-road too frequently, you may want to explore more lightweight alternatives like the Joovy Zoom 360 Ultralight.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When assessing value, this stroller gives a lot of bang for the buck. Its balance of durability and performance means that active families like mine can focus on comfort and dependability without stretching their budget. Higher-end models might offer a few extra bells and whistles but at a price that doesn‚Äôt necessarily justify the upgrades for casual joggers. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs looking for that sweet spot between affordability and function, this product manages to tick a lot of the right boxes.

This is not my first rodeo with the venue nor Ministry, but I can attest that Bomb Factory is back! The previous owners let it get run down but it's a classy venue now. The restrooms were nicer than some restaurants I have visited complete with attendants that offer you a towel and a spritz of cologne. They have lots of bars and a full menu there plus a coffee bar for teetotalers like me. As for the bands, I wasn't impressed by Die Krupps. They seemed like a low-rent Rammstein to Mr. And they were very metal- not in a Metal Machine Music way. Nitzer Ebb were great. I don't think Douglas is a part of the band anymore but the singer sounded just like him. They played a nice cross section of their discography but not enough from That Total Age, imo. Ministry took forever to set up but it was worth it. Al looked a little thin and his performance was kinda low energy, however he sang the lyrics and didn't rely on the backing track. Their lightshow and videos were fun and entertaining with the squirrel making an appearance. They played all the early hits plus some deep tracks that even a long-time fan like me couldn't identify. I had a blast and danced my ass off. If you get a chance to see Ministry on this tour, go!",7,1746476462.0,industrialmusic,7,0.9,False

Donut Savant is in Oakland‚Äôs Allendale neighborhood off 38th and Penniman. Small, cozy spot with a warm vibe. There is a little seating area if you want to chill and eat there. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and taken care of.
