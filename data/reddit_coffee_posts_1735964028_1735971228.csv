----------------------------------------------------------

Using black decor in your home can create a stunning and dramatic effect that transforms ordinary spaces into extraordinary ones. Whether you want to evoke elegance, warmth, or even a bit of mystery, black decor offers unmatched versatility. Here’s how you can successfully incorporate black elements into your interior design.

### Choosing the Right Black Decor Items

The first step is to select decor pieces that resonate with your style. Here are some options you can consider:

- **Furniture:** Large black furniture pieces, such as sofas or dining tables, serve as a striking focal point.
- **Artwork:** Black-themed artwork can add depth to your walls and serve as conversation starters.
- **Rugs:** A black area rug can ground a room while adding a touch of drama.
- **Accent Walls:** A black accent wall can dramatically change the mood of a room.
- **Accessories:** Black vases, picture frames, and decor items enhance other colors and textures in your space.

When selecting these items, think about how they will interact with your existing decor. Pair them with lighter shades or warm textures to create balance and prevent the room from feeling too dark.

### Creating Balance and Contrast

Balancing the boldness of black decor is essential to achieving a well-designed space. Here are some strategies for creating contrast:

- **Pair with Light Colors:** Use white or light-colored walls and furnishings to offset black items. This contrast makes the black elements pop.
- **Add Textures:** Incorporate different materials like wood, metal, or fabric. A black leather sofa can look luxurious next to a light wood coffee table.
- **Incorporate Patterns:** Use patterned textiles that include black elements. Striped or geometrically patterned throw pillows can add fun energy.

By mixing textures and patterns, you create depth and interest in your design. This approach ensures the black decor enhances, rather than overwhelms, the space.

### Lighting Considerations

Lighting plays a vital role when using black decor. Proper lighting can amplify the dramatic effect you want. Here’s how:

- **Use Soft Lighting:** Warm white light can soften the starkness of black decor while creating a cozy atmosphere.
- **Highlight Key Features:** Use spotlights or lamps to draw attention to specific black decor items, such as an art piece or a statement furniture piece.
- **Layered Lighting:** Combine various light sources, such as wall sconces, table lamps, and overhead fixtures, for an inviting glow.

By experimenting with different lighting options, you can achieve the perfect ambiance for your black-themed spaces.

### Adding Plants and Natural Elements

Integrating plants can soften the boldness of black decor while adding life to the area. Here are some practical tips:

- **Choose Vibrant Greens:** Bright green plants stand out beautifully against black, bringing energy into the space.
- **Use Textured Planters:** Opt for textured or patterned black planters to discuss the relationship between natural elements and decor.
- **Mix Heights:** Incorporate plants of varying heights and sizes to create visual intrigue.

These natural elements introduce warmth and can ease the intensity of black decor. By combining green foliage with black features, you create a stunning, balanced space.

### Experimenting with Different Styles

Black decor is not one-size-fits-all; it works across various design styles. Consider these interpretations:

- **Modern:** In modern decor, sleek black furniture paired with minimalist accessories creates a sophisticated look.
- **Industrial:** Raw finishes and exposed elements combined with black can enhance an industrial style.
- **Classic:** Traditional designs benefit from ornate black frames and elegant furniture, adding a dash of drama.

Whichever style you choose, make sure that your black decor reflects your personal taste. The right application of black can convey your aesthetic while ensuring a dramatic impact.

Black decor into your home is a beautiful way to achieve a dramatic effect while still maintaining elegance. By selecting the right decor items, creating balance, utilizing effective lighting, adding greenery, and experimenting with various styles, you can enjoy a curated space that showcases your unique taste. With these tips, you are well on your way to transforming your home into a stunning retreat full of drama and style.

Balancing Dark Tones with Light Colors for Stylish Interiors
------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a stylish interior often involves a delicate balance between dark and light tones. When done right, using dark colors can add depth and drama to your space, while lighter hues provide contrast and brightness. Mastering this balance can transform a room from ordinary to extraordinary.

Dark tones can be incredibly striking. They evoke a sense of luxury and sophistication. Whether it's a deep navy blue, rich burgundy, or classic black, dark colors can ground a space and make it feel cozy. However, too much darkness can overwhelm a room, leaving it feeling small and cramped. This is where the interplay of light colors comes into play.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
### Choosing Your Color Palette

When planning your design, start by selecting a color palette that includes both dark and light tones. Consider the following:

- **Dark Base Colors:** Opt for one or two dominant dark shades for walls or larger furniture pieces. A charcoal gray or an inky blue can serve as a beautiful backdrop.
- **Accent Colors:** Use lighter shades for accents. White, cream, or pastel colors can break up the heaviness of dark tones.
- **Textures and Materials:** Consider varying textures, such as a velvet navy couch paired with a light linen throw pillow. This combination adds interest while maintaining a cohesive look.

### Strategic Placement of Dark Decor

Dark decor thoughtfully can amplify the overall aesthetics without making the room feel dark and dreary. Here are some effective strategies:

- Use dark furniture pieces, like a sleek black table or a dark-stained bookshelf, to anchor the space.
- Paint one wall a deep shade to create a feature wall. This will draw the eye and provide a stunning focal point.
- Incorporate dark decor elements like picture frames, artwork, or mirrors with dark frames to connect the room's color scheme.

### Light Colors as Balancing Agents

Light colors are your best allies when working with dark tones. They can brighten up your space and create an inviting atmosphere. Here’s how to use them effectively:

- **Walls:** If you’re hesitant to paint all walls dark, consider painting the ceiling or one wall dark while keeping the others light.
- **Accessories:** Choose light-colored throw pillows or blankets that pop against dark furniture. This adds balance and keeps the eye moving around the room.
- **Rugs:** A light-colored rug on a dark floor can create contrast and delineate space effectively.

### Lighting Matters

Don’t underestimate the power of lighting. Good lighting can enhance both dark and light elements in your interior design.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- Opt for warm-toned light bulbs to soften the appearance of dark tones and keep the room feeling welcoming.
- Use table lamps and floor lamps with light-colored shades to diffuse the light and create a beautiful glow.
- Consider adding mirrors to reflect light and brighten up the dark areas, making your space feel larger.

### Mixing Patterns and Fabrics

Patterns in your fabrics can also add depth to your design. Patterned cushions, throw blankets, or curtains in light colors can contrast beautifully with a dark backdrop.

- **Stripes and Geometric:** Patterns that incorporate both dark and light elements draw connections throughout the room.
- **Floral Designs:** Using light floral designs against dark upholstery can soften the look and add a touch of femininity.

The harmonious blending of dark and light tones can set your home apart, creating visually stunning interiors. By thoughtfully selecting your colors, placements, and materials, you can craft a space that feels both grounded and uplifting. Remember, the goal is not just to look stylish but to create a space that feels inviting and balanced, welcoming you at the end of the day.

### Conclusion

To achieve a striking and impactful atmosphere in your home, incorporating black decor is an excellent choice. It offers a depth and sophistication that can elevate any space while allowing you to express your personal style. By thoughtfully selecting black furniture, accent pieces, and wall treatments, you can transform ordinary rooms into dramatic showcases. Remember, the key is to use black as a statement color while ensuring it complements the overall design of your interior.

Balancing dark tones with light colors is essential for maintaining a stylish ambiance. By pairing black with whites, pastels, or warm neutral shades, you create a dynamic interplay that prevents the space from feeling too heavy or overwhelming. This contrast can illuminate your decor, enhance natural light, and make your area feel more inviting.

Consider using textures and patterns alongside black decor to make the space feel lively and layered. materials like wood, metal, or textiles adds warmth, ensuring that your home remains cozy despite the chic dark elements.

I have been extremely nice to all my co workers and literally work as hard as I possibly can. I literally run back and forth everywhere and rush as fast as I can. I learned a couple days ago that 2 employees went to my manager and said that I wasn’t trying hard enough  even though I clearly am. I was so mad and confused that I went to the bathroom and cried. I don’t understand why people are so stuck up when im literally putting my all in and everyone else was saying that im doing good. Also we line bust at this job so we go outside and take orders and someone at my work told me if I get worn out taking orders then I can ask if it’s okay if I come work inside. I was line busting for 3 hours in the freezing cold and I politely asked if their was anyway I could switch positions if it was possible and the shift lead said that was okay. Then she went to my manager and told her about it like what the heck why tell me something is okay and then go to my manager. Im seriously as nice as possible I just think some people have it out for me. I fear im going to get fired if they keep doing stuff like this for no reason. I seriously don’t understand why they don’t just come to me and try to sort it out I think they just want me out. Sad thing too is I was hired along with another person and I give everyone the same respect aand work as hard as this person but everyone adores them and then they don’t really care about me. I feel like im in highschool where everyone picks favorites and trys to make people look bad that they are jealous of. I genuinely don’t know what to do my manager said the last few days that I was doing good but im afraid the snitch is going to get me fired. I get criticism if its valid but it literally wasn’t. I don’t take breaks i run around and I hurry as fast as I can. I stopped momentarily when no one was in line to drink water a few times but that literally was it.

New Zepbounder here… I just started a few weeks ago on the 2.5 mg dosage and usually jab myself in the thigh. I’ve been working out 4x a week at boxing classes (which trust me gets in an amazing sweat and 800 calories a class roughly), also lifting weights and walking on the other days and eating healthy (salads, protein - LOTS of protein, taking supplements, drinking water - occasional Diet Coke and coffee here and there), not drinking alcohol, no drug usage so I’m like why am I just down 7 lbs?!? I did HCG before and that was having me lose 2 pounds a day but I tripled the weight back cause the diet was so unsustainable. 

I don’t want this to be a round 2 - I’m not feeling nauseous or most side effects thankfully but I am not eating half as much as I used to (yay). Any tips on how to expedite the diet or any additional tips to lose on it?

I see people lose 30 lbs the first month and I’m here like hi! 😂 I have a wedding to go to in July, so going down by 30-50 lbs would be awesome if so.

If they texted everyday, how would you feel? If they texted often, but it was friendly in nature with no flirting, would you be okay? for leisure mostly, let’s say. They seem close.  They go out to get coffee together on their lunch break, and buy treats for each other. How about if they hung out after work a bit, but not a full hang out? Like just smoking together or something, one on one, no one around. If they hug this person a lot. If they compliment them often, tell them they’re pretty and kind, or maybe that they wear nice clothes and are fun to be around, etc., but it’s just platonic. 

I’m just curious the extent of jealousy one might feel.

We've been trying really hard to have a baby. Every time my husband finishes, a bunch of dust comes out. It's been a lot to handle. 

He blames it on me, saying that if I was hot like my sister (15F) then maybe it would be a normal consistency. I cant tell you how many times I've sobbed, begging for forgiveness. 

Miraculously, I got pregnant and we now have a 5 month old baby boy. I breast feed exclusively. My in laws have convinced my husband that doing so is the best way to prevent ""the 'tism and the downs"". I have no idea what that could mean but my husband screams if I hesitate to whip out my teat.

We have developed a schedule where I get up every 87 mins to feed our baby then my husband will care for him while I sleep for 13 minutes. 

What's worse is that for a month or so, I've been getting really itchy when I wake up. It turns out that there's lice in my pubes. When I confronted my husband, he says I'm being ""hysterical"". He swears I'm making up a reason to fight just because he scratches his balls a lot. This is a new adjustment for us all and I'm trying extremely hard to be mindful of that.

So today, I just got done with the baby. I was sleeping when I felt hot liquid poured on my face. I woke up drenched in coffee?!! Before I could say anything, my husband gave me a purple nurple (he twisted my nipples extra hard).

I asked him why would do this then there was a knock at the door. My mom came over to help prepare food so I can get some extra rest. 

He accused me of ""outsourcing my womanly duties to an old hag"" and told me to die. I tried to explain that I need rest to produce milk but he said I was exaggerating. He ranted for the next 3 hours about how women produce milk when they hit puberty and I ""wasted my fat sweater knockers being a whore with random guys"". 

I don't know what to do at this point. I know we're both exhausted from the baby but I can't ask my husband for help because he's either gone or playing video games. I'm so tired and I don't know where to turn. Please advise how I can be a better mother and wife.

1ht7t14,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ht7t14/trip_report_11_days_in_tokyo_matsumoto_takayama/,"Trip Report: 11 days in Tokyo, Matsumoto, Takayama, Shirakawa-go, and Kanazawa","Wanted to provide a trip report as this community has been super helpful in my trip planning, so hopefully this goes on to help other people planning their Japan trips. For context, this was a family trip of 5 people, all but one of us had been to Japan before. We went in late December through to early January. We wanted to get some Tokyo hustle & bustle/some shopping we wanted done, but then to otherwise enjoy a more casual pace, some good walks, good sights, and good food. Everyone who'd been to Japan previously had been to the classic triangle of Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka so we were wanting to mostly avoid repetition while still hitting some of the Tokyo highlights for the newcomer.



In total we did 2.5 days in Tokyo, 1 day in Matsumoto, 3 ish days in Takayama (really three half days), 2.5 days in Kanazawa, and then finished off in Tokyo for another 24 hours before flying out again.

  
In rereading this post I realized it's quite long and rambly - my apologies. I've bolded places/sights of interest to hopefully make it a little more readable.



**Day one: Tokyo**

* not a ton to be said here - we landed around 4pm ish but were super tired due to a convoluted flight path
* checked into our hotel in Shibuya, got a meal, and passed out

**Days two-three: Tokyo - shopping, temples, Ginza Hachigou**

* Got coffee at **Fuglen** in Tokyo, quite enjoyed the coffee; conbini breakfast
* Shopped around **Harujuku**, **Omotesando**, etc. for a good chunk of the morning
* went over to **Koenji Temple** \- was absolutely gorgeous as the trees still had some golden leaves on them
* wandered around Koenji area. Cute and quieter vibe here.
* Ended up in Shinjuku...forget why exactly but popped over to **Golden Gai** for a drink
* Next day, woke up, went to Tsukiji, had breakfast there
* Shopped around **Ginza** for most of mid morning
* Mostly killed time as I had reservations for **Ginza Hachigou -** formerly Michelin star'd ramen
   * was actually fairly easy to make reservations, just had to be on the ball for when resos opened
   * It was a really great experience and the noodles, broth, and cha siu were excellent
   * I'd be lying if I didn't say I didn't feel like there's definitely some degree of diminishing returns with such high quality ramen. I thought it was absolutely excellent but also if it was a 10/10, I've certainly had many 9.5's without as much fanfare
   * That said, since I had resos and didn't have to try too hard to get them, or stand in line too long, plus it was quite reasonably priced, I'd say it was definitely worth it. I don't think I'd wait >30 minutes for it, personally
* Shopped a little more after lunch and then went over to **Senso-ji** for night time lighting. Pretty!

**Day four: Matsumoto - castle, nice hotel, good food**

* Took a morning Shinkansen over
* stayed at the **Onyado Nono** \- would recommend!
   * very reasonable pricing
   * they keep it sparkling clean: it's fully tatami mats on the inside, so they clean your luggage wheels and have you put your shoes in a locker at the lobby. It was sooo nice to walk around in just slippers or even barefoot and have it feel so clean. Felt like a sleepover at a good friend's
   * free soba service in the evening (9 or 9:30 till about 11pm)! This was so surprising and the noodles and broth were honestly great. I've definitely paid for worse noodles at home and you could get as many bowls as you want or bring it up to your room
   * The onsen (once we got over the public nudity) was quite nice as well
* Explored the city a little bit, mostly checking out **Matsumoto castle**, frog street, etc.
* Got dinner at a cute shop (**Okina-Do)** serving omurice and other Western foods - the omurice, while not being the viral kind where they split the egg and the curds spill out, was absolutely delicious and one of my favourite meals of the trip, partially because it was just such a nice surprise with no significant expectations

**Day five: Takayama - vibey snowy shrine, historic districts, surprise latte**

* booked a noon bus so killed some time getting coffee in Matsumoto
* got into Takayama in mid afternoon. Checked in, got some ramen, wandered a bit although it got dark quickly after we started
* Made it to the historic districts (Oshinmachi), which were super cute and although quiet at dusk, was really quite special and peaceful to walk through in the evening light. It was gently snowing with a few inches of snow on some of the roofs and trees which really added to the atmosphere. Made it up to **Sakurayama Hachimangu** shrine which, in the evening light + snow all over the grounds, was absolutely stunning. Really stopped us in our tracks and made us stare for a while
* Some of us were getting pretty tired so we started making our way back to the hotel. Along the way we stopped for a snack/bathroom break at **Cha-Mame Cafe** which was another standout surprise. They make their matcha lattes with what sounded like a blender - it was extremely foamy and almost soup-like, also served in something closer to a soup bowl. That + the pudding we got there was super unique and incredibly tasty. We wanted to go back to try their actual food but didn't get a chance to, sadly, and we were pretty full from our late lunch still

**Day six: Shirakawago / back to Takayama - snow, snow delays, sake & beef**

* woke up for an 8:10 bus to Shirakawago with arrival at 9:00
* got in and it was an absolute winter wonderland. Multiple feet of snow everywhere and it was actively snowing quite heavily
* walked around the initial area and then made our way to the open-air museum, where we entered for a nominal fee... 3-500 yen each?
* the open-air museum was lovely but possibly because we had gotten in early + they had had such heavy snow, that some of the trails had not yet been plowed and the snow was chest-high at those points, so we only got to see about 2/3 of the viewpoints
* Not to worry as we were getting hungry, so we exited and got breakfast at one of the restaurants - really just the first one we saw that was open. Had some soup, I got Hoba Miso Hidagyu - a hida beef dish cooked on a burner plate with a miso marinade + on a hoba leaf, what I'd read was a regional dish for the area. Was quite good!
* we did *not* walk up to the viewpoint - it was snowing so heavily that we worried we wouldn't be able to see much from there
* We booked the 12:35 bus back to Takayama which, while we were walking the open air museum, felt like it was a little on the tight side, although by the time bus time came around we were pretty satisfied with all we had walked (we were also getting quite cold and damp at this point - it never let up snowing for a second)
* Due to the heavy winter conditions, our return bus ended up being delayed by 45 minutes anyways lol. The bus station was a little chaotic and it was hard to know which incoming bus was which. The 11:45 bus showed up at 12:35 but we were told it was the 11:45... Fine, no problem. Then at 1:15, another bus showed up but we were told this was the 1:15 non-reserved bus and we had to wait for the 12:35 which was still on the way. Seemed odd to us they wouldn't prioritize the earlier and reserved bus, but...whatever. In the end the drive back took a bit longer too due to conditions so we got back almost 2 hours later than I'd initially planned
* Got back to Takayama, rested and dried off at the hotel for a bit. Went back out to visit a **sake distillery (Funasaka Sake)** which was fun - you pay for drink tokens which gets you a little porcelain sake shot cup and you can use the tokens at self serve machines; there were signs telling you the characteristics at each sake and you had the option of getting each sake cold or heating it up. 
* For dinner, we went to the adjoining yakiniku spot, **Aji-no-Yohei**, and we all had Hida Beef for dinner - their regional premium beef, competitive to Kobe or Wagyu. This was absolutely excellent and the beef was all the superlatives - incredibly tender, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth.

**Day seven: Takayama / Transit to Kanazawa - more snowy temples, food & transit**

* Woke up, checked out, explored the morning markets and walked around the historic districts a little bit more as the bus delays from the previous day robbed us of some daylight & energy
* Walked through the morning markets which were cool, got some really good custard.
* I really, really enjoyed walking the other **temples** at the foothills on the **eastern side** of town. Super peaceful and beautiful walking amongst snowy shrines set amongst the pines & cedars. Could stand and stare there for hours. 
* Some other members of our group split off to the Retro Museum, which they really enjoyed
* We had debated going to the Hida open air museum but with the bus delays + having just seen Shirakawago, it didn't seem different enough to merit that chunk of time/waking up early for it
* got a last quick pre-shinkansen bowl of ramen at **Masago Soba** \- this was well reviewed on Tabelog, but honestly I was just looking for something quick with no wait. This was another surprise standout... I found the Takayama-style chuka soba as a whole a little bit simple and rustic for my liking, but this was really really well done with super tender cha siu. It really helped that we got a side booth where I could watch the ramen being made and also see the snow falling outside. Great vibes.
* Shinkansen onwards to Kanazawa (the buses from Takayama-Shirakawago-Kanazawa had stopped by then - this would've been my original, ideal itinerary but they take and end-of-year break)
* Got into Kanazawa, got dinner at **GoGo Curry** (quite good + good value) in the station, passed out

  
**Day eight: Kanazawa - full day touring; coffee, shrines, houses, and castles**

* Woke up and walked over to **Omicho markets** for breakfast. I had a Wagyu skewer for 1200 yen which felt like a steal compared to other markets I'd been to. It was excellent
* Went to **Kaikado Coffee** \- something I'd found off Tiktok - it's a small cafe run by an 80-year old man who's owned it for 45 years. He's particularly proud of his 100-year old made-in-Japan coffee hand grinder. It was quite good, and incredibly charming. He's very passionate about his coffee and will very cutely, and gently, try to convince you to get a coffee even if you ask for tea - he's very proud that it's not bitter at all and very smooth. Despite some of our group wanting tea we couldn't resist his charms and all greatly enjoyed his brew.
* Walked over to **Oyama Shrine** \- very beautiful, nice and peaceful walk-through
* Walked down to **Nagamachi districts** \- samurai districts, and toured the samurai residence there. Was incredibly peaceful and serene. 
* Got lunch at a nearby ramen shop. Dessert/coffee at the hilariously named Moron cafe nearby which was also quite good.
* Walked over to **Kanazawa castle**
   * this was another pleasant surprise. As far as castles go I've just been to this, Matsumoto, and also Osaka castle
   * this was the biggest castle grounds I'd been to, not having been to Himeji yet, and it was immaculately kept. I'd worried I'd get castle fatigue by now but it was quite a nice walk through
   * the grounds are fully open and free to walk, and you pay a small fee to tour the inside, which mostly reviews the construction - it's pretty incredible and shows how it was all assembled via wood joinery. Mindblowing.
* Didn't quite make it in time to the Ken-rokuen gardens before closing so we walked up to the **Higashi Chaya** district to enjoy it in the evening light
* got **Shogun burger** for dinner and honestly it was probably my best burger I'd eaten all year, lol

  
**Day nine**: **Kanazawa - coffee, garden, rains, rice**

* Went back to Higashi Chaya district for breakfast 
* got coffee at **Nonstop Coffee** \- another standout
   * this was something I didn't research at all but just stumbled upon, but it was amazing and the best coffee I've had all trip, possibly ever. Sorry, 80-year old guy.
   * they're a pour-over specialty place and they have an assortment of beans for you to try and smell before you buy, and serve coffee in wine glasses so you can really appreciate the colour and aroma
   * I had a flight and thought they'd be taster sized...they were full glasses so I was absolutely buzzing after this
   * Some people got matcha instead and it was honestly similarly standout - some of the best balanced matcha between umami, bitterness, and sweetness I've had
* We shopped the district a little more but then a thunderstorm rolled in and it absolutely poured so we made our way over to Kenrokuen gardens
* to wait out the rain, we got **Hanton rice** at a restaurant right outside Kenrokuen
   * the restaurant name was all in Kanji but it's right across the block
   * we probably paid some tourist tax for its proximity to the garden but man this rice was a standout. It's a regional take on omurice and incredibly hearty and comforting - especially when it's pouring rain outside. Pretty large portions at this place too.
   * Got more matcha/hojicha at **SWAY coffee** which was excellent
* Walked the gardens which were quite beautiful, but we were all kind of damp and a little over it at this point
* Shopped a little more and then went back to the hotel to dry off
* Went back out and got dinner at a random izakaya

**Day ten - eleven: Tokyo - ramen, bars, and arcades**

* got a morning shinkansen back to Tokyo and got in just after noon. Checked in, and we all kind of did our own thing from here
* I was on a quest to get as much ramen as possible in my last 24 hours but unfortunately this was in the post new year holiday time period so a lot of shops were closed. I did get chicken shoyu ramen at **Ramen Neiroya Shinjuku** which was fantastic - I *love* Tokyo-style chicken shoyu - as well as the tonkotsu at **Tatsunoya** \- possibly the best cha siu I've ever had in my life, incredibly tender and smokey with a bit of background spice, ugh. The broth at Tatsunoya was similarly excellent, although they use the very thin noodles typical of Hakata ramen, and I definitely prefer thicker noodles, but it all came together amazingly so I was quite happy
* Went back to Golden Gai and bar hopped a little, that was fun. Then took our buzz to the nearby arcades & claw games
* Got on a very sad NEX trip back to Narita and that's a trip!



**Final thoughts**

* Overall I was quite pleased with the trip as far as pacing goes, it felt like an appropriate amount of time in each area, with the slight exception of I wish we had maybe a bit more daylight time to spend in Takayama, but it's hard to predict weather-related road delays. So I guess let that be a warning for people going to Shirakawa-go in the winter
* Tabelog for food-finding reigns supreme to me, but also being open to the shop around the corner will yield some awesome surprises
* Christmastime was not an influence at all in businesses being open or closed. New Year's Eve, some places closed early but others were mostly normal. New Year's Day and the week thereafter, expect mom & pop shops to be closed for anywhere from Jan 1-3 or even the whole week of 1-5, based on the signs we saw. You'll still find options and won't starve but be more limited to larger businesses or chains. Some attractions (Kanazawa Castle, Kenrokuen) are open year-round
* I have too many thoughts lol

The biggest thing keeping me going is this sub, the pride I’ll feel if I accomplish this, and the health benefits it’ll bring. I hope this turns from dry January into a permanent cut back on alcohol. 

My tips for others: Diet Coke with lime, bitter drinks like decaf black coffee with some sugar if you’re a dry wine kind of person, cherry juice, sparkling waters, and put them in a real glass with ice! This has done wonders for that sipping fix. Also, my prime time was in the evening when I’m relaxing so instead I’ve gone full overboard with skincare and body care.

You ever notice how motion graphics are like that friend who’s good at everything? They can dance, they can cook, they even know how to fix your Wi-Fi. But then you wonder, “Are they really good for everyone?” Well, let’s find out if motion graphics are the universal key—or just another trend that looks cool until it doesn’t.


---

🚗 Driving Sales in Auto? Oh, Absolutely!
Picture this: a 3D car zooms into the frame, flips open its hood in a sleek motion, and practically whispers, “Buy me.” The auto industry loves motion graphics because nothing screams horsepower like an animated turbocharger. Trust me, no one ever bought a car because of static clip art.


---

🩺 Healthcare: Need More Pulse!
Can motion graphics work in healthcare? Heck yes. Imagine an explainer video where organs come to life, smiling and waving while explaining complex medical procedures. It’s like Disney meets anatomy class. Motion graphics make healthcare approachable—because, honestly, no one likes a PowerPoint slide titled “Your Cholesterol Levels Are a Mess.”


---

☕ Coffee Shops: Do We Really Need It?
Now here’s a debate: does your local café need motion graphics? Probably not. I mean, you’re already there for the caffeine, not a mesmerizing video about how beans are roasted. Unless… the coffee beans are breakdancing. Then I’m in.

👔 Finance: Stocks That Pop (Literally)
Stocks going up, stocks going down—motion graphics are the stock market’s hype crew. Animations help simplify those “buy low, sell high” charts that make your head spin. Plus, there’s nothing like a dollar sign exploding on-screen to grab attention. Cha-ching!

🏗️ Construction: Build or Bust?
You’d think construction wouldn’t need flashy animations. But imagine showing clients a time-lapse animation of their future building rising from the ground, brick by brick. It’s like Minecraft, but with real money at stake. Who wouldn’t sign the contract after that?

🎤 Closing Act: Motion Graphics Don’t Lie—But They Might Dance
So, are motion graphics effective for all industries? Not always. I mean, a funeral home probably shouldn’t use animated skeletons. But for 95% of industries, motion graphics are the wingman you never knew you needed—flashy, reliable, and guaranteed to steal the spotlight.

Now, the question is: Is your business ready to let motion graphics work their magic? Or are you still trying to make clip art “cool” again? Let’s hear your thoughts below! 👇

After a late night of drinking she invited me back to her place to spend the night. We’re both in school and living in our parents’ basements right now. So we go back to her place have a little fun and end up snuggling into bed together. 

The next morning she gets up before me and goes upstairs saying she’s going to diffuse her Dad because she didn’t tell him I was staying the night. So she comes back down a while later and we end up getting dressed and going out for coffee before she took me home. Her Dad was very polite but I could tell there was some tension or awkwardness since I’d only met her parents once before and pretty briefly. 

I picked her up today to go out to eat and upon seeing her Dad again I apologized if I was unwelcome and that I wouldn’t have stayed here if I had known he wasn’t aware. He said there was no need to apologize and that he figured I would’ve stayed the night at some point soon anyway and it’s all fine. 

But as we left my girl was very upset saying that I was making her look bad to her parents by “apologizing for her” when there was no problem in the first place. She’s quite mad and I know I’m going to end up apologizing in the morning but I just want to know am I the asshole here?

met a new girl over instagram. want to meet her in person, but unsure how to ask because we haven’t had that much interaction.

ive been texting this girl over winter break. We both attend the same college but I’ve never seen her on campus before. she seems to be friendly, as she responds to messages timely and laughs at my really dumb jokes. I want to ask to meet her in person but I don’t know how. We’ve only had a few interactions and I’ve never seen her in person before, but I just get a good vibe y’know.

ive done this before with other people, but i was aquatinted for awhile before gathering the courage to ask. but with her the thing is we don’t really know each other so I think asking out of the blue ‘let’s get coffee sometime and chat‘ might be awkward. And I can’t think of an excuse to message her beforehand.

so what do I do? I want to meet her in person so I can get a feel for the actual vibe and then decide if I try and peruse her or see if I made a new friend. any advice for how to talk to her more?

I won't go too much into detail, but I have somewhat of a ""soft masc"" aesthetic, my major is extremely male-dominated, I have a far less bubbly personality than she does. 

I usually enjoy our differences, but recently I've noticed that we've fallen into heteronormative gender roles where I am ""the man"" in our relationship. I'm very busy during the semester, but I still make time for her: sleepovers, dinner/coffee dates, flowers, etc. I open doors for her, carry her belongings, and drive her to and from my apartment when she stays over. 

She doesn't really do anything like this in return though, at least not as often as I do. Obviously I don't do all this for the sole reason of her doing something for me, but I want to feel appreciated. Sometimes it feels like she just doesn't care. As an example, for my birthday, she gave me my gift nine days late, and it wasn't even wrapped. For her birthday, I hand-crocheted and sewed a tote bag with the little free time I had during the semester. 

I'm not sure if this boils down to gender roles, but It still makes me feel unappreciated and I've found myself beginning to resent her. I obviously want to stop this, but I don't know how to bring it up to her. I've tried to in the past, but she ends up crying and then I have to comfort her. Even when I don't bring it up, she needs constant reassurance that I love her and that she is good enough for me. I always give in because I hate to see her sad, but it's been taking a toll on me.

This was my first try at an actual uranium power plant. In the past I just spaguetti slap one maybe two nuclear plants, not optimized etc.

For some crazy reason in my mind one nuclear power plant consumed 1 uranium fuel rod... So I took my happy self to satisfactory tools and planned a production line for 5 uranium fuel rods per minute. I figured 5 nuclear plants should be plenty of power to get through the game or at least for a long while.

After two days of planning, building etc I was done with the entire production line. Only thing left place the nuclear plants down, hook them up and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. After placing the first one and clicking on it to double check how much water I needed... I happened to hover on the fuel icon... come to find out each plant only consumes 0.2 uranium fuel rods per minute...

Only sensible thing after that was to build 20 more nuclear power plants lol.

3 days later and 62K MW of power later I can finally go back to reworking my base after a quick ""let me go set up some nuclear power real quick"".

I've had a few machines before so I'm not a total newbie, but I'm at a bit of a loss with my new machine.

Also having issues with the built in grinder. It makes a loud crunching sound every now and then before returning to the usual grinding noise. Sometimes I have to stop the machine because I feel like something is going to shred apart. This noise occurs mostly between grind sizes of 1-15, but sometimes in 15+. But the closest I can get to a decent cup requires low grind sizes.

Has anyone had any similar issues? The new machine was meant to be a housewarming treat to myself, but I want to drop kick the damned thing currently.

1ht79r2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ht79r2,Looking to redo my entire office for MCM and I’m a bit overwhelmed,"I been in my home office for 11 years and looking to do a renovation. What I would like is a MCM style office. The room is not very large. I would say it’s about a 10X10 or a 11x10 room. Almost everything has to go here. Only exception would be my Herman Miller Aeron chair. Flooring I’m getting measured tomorrow by Lowe’s to where I’m considering a red oak flooring. The biggest decision for furniture would be the desk as I worked from home for all these 11 years. Unfortunately I don’t care for the layout of this room for a desk. As you can see in the pictures, the current desk overlaps the window. Now ideally I would like to face the window so that I can see outside. The length of that corner where my desk is at is 48 inches. That does leave me a bit limited. And I’m thinking I would like to wall mount a Samsung Frame TV so that i have a monitor but looks like artwork when it’s off.

 When reviewing desks that would fit for that 48” space, I got a couple of ideas. I was thinking a Herman Miller Swag Leg desk: https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-furniture-desks/nelson-swag-leg-desk/6255.html?lang=en_US . And then put the TV slightly above shelf. I think I’m ok with ergonomics on this. When I looked at the max height, that is roughly where my currently ultrawide is at off the current desk. I measured from the floor up. And I really like the desk with those dividers. I got quite a bit of fountain pens and inks and those would fit in those pretty well. The only thing that might be a bit of a challenge here is wire management on that desk having the shelf. There is a grommett there for wires, but it’s only at the right side of the desk. 

One other desk I had an idea about is a Tanker Desk, but with only one pedestal. One example is like this: https://retrooffice.com/collections/vintage-brushed-steel-collection/products/allsteel-single-pedestal-tanker-desks. I really like this desk and if I had the room on that one wall, I would go with a full 60” one. However, I’m good with the 48” desk. Downside these are expensive to restore. I don’t really see to many of these in my area like others mentioned in other Reddit posts. And I don’t think I would be good at restoring or moving these. I’m told tanker desks are MCM, but I have no idea what goes with that. I really like the metal look of a barrister bookcase like this: https://retrooffice.com/products/vintage-steel-lawyers-barrister-bookcase-1?gQT=1. But I heard this wouldn’t be MCM. However, I do like that metal look. Would other MCM furniture go with these tanker desks?

For that Kallax unit that is overlapping the other side of the window, I was thinking of getting a media tower and hide all of my electronics. That is where my laptops and other handhelds would go.  Thinking of this. https://www.crutchfield.com/S-oyxAhZIHuQg/p_6318172CWL/BDI-Corridor-8172-Chocolate-Stained-Walnut.html?XVINQ=D74&XVVer=7YA&awcr=632574315593&awdv=c&awnw=g&awug=9011503&awkw=dsa-825495277635&awmt=&awat=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAst67BhCEARIsAKKdWOn-h4Y5tOhWzaW1PvddKU7p8Mt9PYwFnQtcEQQ3fhcDAv-EzP5_aaEaAteGEALw_wcB

And that armoire is at, I really would like to get a Eames chair replica. Thinking of one of those arc lamps in the corner and a coffee table that would be MCM like. This would be used for my reading. And then the bookshelf, thinking that barrister bookcase if I go with the tanker. Other alternates would be considering a bookcase like this https://nathanjames.com/products/wood-fluted-storage-bookshelf-warm-pine

A couple other notes is I did consider that wall without the window to the right of the desk. However, I would have to look behind me a bit to see my driveway. I think I’m pretty set on using that 48” of space for my desk. Also, I’m downsizing a lot of what is in the pictures. I used to do a lot of retro game collecting and there is a retro gaming computer in that armoire. But I’m getting rid of all of that and there will be books only. 

So really I’m lost and I spent quite a bit of time researching this. Looking for suggestions on if I’m on the right path or maybe better ideas than I have. ",1,1735967984.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

Thing is, she SWEARS she never ordered this stuff and I believe her.

BUT -- she has an order confirm in her email address from Sunday morning (she rarely checks her emails, which is a bad habit of hers, TBH) and never saw this confirm or the subsequent shipping and confirmation of delivery message, either. The latter of the three is kinda creepy.

Anyway, it came out of our Discover CC account. That card isn't stored on her phone or her PC.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/Pb6BaX76Uk)  **Nov 5, 2018**

So i'll try to keep this as short as possible. I've always wanted to try pot and I have a coworker who works part time at a dispensary and he said he would bring me some marijuana to try sometime. I live in California so I know it's legal but I don't go to the dispensary because my wife thinks weed is terrible for you and she doesn't want me using it. My coworker came in to work today with some brownies he had made at home and offered me one.  I ask him if there's any weed in them and he says ""no"". I grab one and begin to pounded it down with my coffee except I notice it tastes a bit funny. I ask about the flavor and he says ""Its made from all organic, different than typical brownies"" and laughs it off. Being the dumb ass that I am I shrug it off and continue through my workday. 30 minutes go by and my heart rate just spikes randomly and I start sweating bullets. I start to breath manually and I freak the fuck out. I have no idea what's going on and I end up asking my boss to call an ambulance. 

I end up getting picked up and taken to the hospital and the paramedics are asking me questions on how i'm feeling, if I took anything, etc. I tell them I didn't take anything and they tell me I was having an anxiety attack. I get to the hospital and my coworker texts me saying he put marijuana in the brownies and thought it would be funny to see me high at work. I tell paramedic I ingested a marijuana infused brownie and he tells me to just stay hydrated and relax. I feel like shit and i'm stuck in a hospital right now and i'm beyond pissed off. I dont know what to do and how to bring this up to my boss or if I should pursue a lawyer. Please help! 

Edit: He is now telling me I can't tell my boss or HR because I'd get fired for using marijuana on the job. 

UPDATE: Police report has been filed! I reached out to my boss and he has since then asked my coworker to not come in tomorrow. A meeting is being set up tomorrow with my boss and HR. 

Edit: People are pming me telling me I'm a dickhead for reporting him. Lol wtf. 

UPDATE 2: I am on my way to work. I'll let you guys know what's going to happen. 

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/oNNMrfcFrK)  **Nov 7, 2018**

I've been getting a lot or PMs requesting an update about my edible situation and i'm here to post that now. Thanks for everybody's responses on my last thread. I have never had this happen to me and i'm thankful for everyone's insight on the situation.  I had a meeting with HR and my manager yesterday regarding the edible and they wanted to know everything that had happened. I explained everything and what had happened to and from the hospital. My coworker lied and told HR that I knew the brownie had marijuana and I took it to get through the work day. They asked me if this was true and I told them he was lying. My coworker also told HR I've been asking to try marijuana and that's true, I did ask to try marijuana but never on the job or without my consent. HR told me they needed to hear both sides of the story in order to pursue further action. 

The text message I received in the hospital saved my ass.  I showed the text message stating the edible had marijuana and that he ""thought it would be funny to see me high at work"". They requested a copy of the screenshot and after a few more questions, asked me to go home. I have filed for workers comp and i'm waiting to hear back from my job regarding this mess and what's going to happen now. I'm from California and I've never done this process before. I'm kind of scared I might get fired or somethings will happen with my employment. I guess i'll just have to find out over time. I did notify my boss that the test might not show as positive since i'm not a constant user as advised by redditors in my last thread.  He told me this might be a problem for HR since they will make the final decision on what's going to happen but he will vouch for me and try to make sure nothing happens with my employment. 

My coworker is now threatening to sue me if he gets terminated for ""lying"" about the edible. Can he even do that!? I feel like this whole situation is just getting way out of control. I dont even know what to do. 

Update: Charges are being pressed! 

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/8CxHWJy0uf)  **Nov 8, 2018**

He's been fired!

I came in to work today and had another meeting with my boss regarding the current edible incident. They've terminated my coworker and charges are being pressed. I asked my boss if it was possible to notify the dispensary since I personally want to do as much damage as I can to this guy. My boss took the time to call them and notify his manager. Did it have to go that far? No, but he sure as hell made sure it did. 

I don't know if he's going to continue to be employed with them, but i'm glad this whole thing is over now. I've gotten no legal threats or text messages since yesterday and things seem fine. 

That being said, thanks for all of your advice and responses! 

I'm gonna go get a joint now to celebrate 😁.

1ht6t8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDronesOfficial/comments/1ht6t8q/parabellum_chapter_iv_the_god_that_failed/,"Parabellum, Chapter IV: The God That Failed","Jade’s fingers hovered over her keyboard, frozen in place as if they had been put in casts. But they were not broken. Just mere seconds ago, an idea she was sure would’ve been an ingenious one had streaked across her mind only to promptly vanish like seawater foam on sand. Her gaze wandered from the many programming windows—everything from bitcoin mining softwares, camera footage that covered nearly the whole of the First Hill area, fund monitoring from the various bookmakers that had been fitted into one window, all crowding her monitor—to the overturned bottle of pills. She could just make out the name wrapped around the front of the bottle, though the bottle was face down: *ROSSI, JADE.* They were prescribed by her therapist, who, for all he knew, was prescribing it to a humble, yet talented IT technician. He knew not that he was speaking to LLORONA three days per week, the alias of one of the Rossi Family’s *best* and most notorious hacker—the alias she went by for years. The media didn’t know the Family to be associated with Rossi, rather they were known as “The Faceless Mob”, mainly due to the scratchy, often static-lined dark helmets they wore. Nobody knew their leader, nobody knew their enforcers or their *caporegimes’* identity—the masks came with an intricate jamming software and voice distorter that prevented any penetration, and subsequent recognition—much unlike the other mobs, and nobody made an effort to find their leader. With the exception of Oliver Mackenzie. Now he was in a police morgue because of it, not to mention eyeless. Jade still struggled to wrap her head around that fact—a part of her didn't want to believe Uzi was capable of doing something like that. She was originally detached, if not prideful of the act the college girl had carried out, but now… Jade couldn't quite place the feeling. It wasn’t beyond most of the things she’d seen—it didn’t even make it to the top one-hundred, but just knowing it came from *her…* She had seen the aloof statements by Seattle police chief Tyler McKinley and the doubling of police efforts around the city, which only soothed about a quarter of Seattle’s population. It was surprising that the younger drone hadn’t gotten any sort of reprimand for her actions—yet, Jade groused. But at the same time, a twisted sense of pride curled within her chest, slithering around like a cobra and brushing against every bone in her ribcage.

   The Rossi Mob was the polar, unrecognizable opposite of the Hollywood rendition of the Sicilian Mafia, that was made certain now more than ever.  That perturbed the press out of investigating further; for now. They’d probably end up being confused for the Illuminati if any of them were ever found out, Jade observed. To the public, Aurelio Rossi was a charismatic philanthropic titan and advocate for drones’ rights, not the *mafioso* responsible for innumerable deaths. A man that has built the first apartment complex with elevators and areas meant for *both* species, and spearheaded progression—a man who always warmly smiled for the cameras. The only people who *knew* were the Arroyos, but they couldn't act on it. His fame rendered him untouchable. Jade involuntarily shuddered. She had almost caused that war because she wasn’t careful enough. Then she just *had* to get rough with the *Kurotaka-kai*. Just *had* to teach a lesson to one of them. The bastard had a quick mouth anyway, Jade rationalized. She hated smartasses that weren’t Family. Jade wasn’t exactly one to be browbeaten without a fight—with some exceptions. She would very much like to keep her head on her shoulders for the foreseeable future, even if it was an undesirable one. But a side of her told her maybe she had gone too far. Then the feeling left before it truly registered, replaced with a sinking emptiness that prickled her casing like the chilled November winds outside. A barren, desolate emptiness as vacant and uninhabited as the Mideast’s many deserts. As dull as an old black-and-white movie, but it carried none of the old charm. She found herself wanting to shoot up from her chair, pace about her house—up and down the stairs, brush her hand on the walnut railing in an attempt to feel *anything* besides the freezing air that had begun to seep in from the cracks in the upstairs windows and concentrate into her palms and legs. But the drone remained glued to her seat.

   She’d make an exception for the Family. She really had no choice, anyway. Dante Rossi consummately for his age negotiated the Family out of a potential war with the feared Seattle Yakuza due to the man dying in the hospital, so severe was the buffeting he had received (nobody really interfered, the man was not much liked even by his so-called “friends”) in the form of small concessions in the tech business—not enough to gain a foothold to challenge their dominance in that field, but just enough to satisfy the Yakuza. Jade was lucky she still kept the position of lead hacker in the area of First Hill. She had always liked the rugged scenery, and Jade was far too valuable to lose that position. Dante’s diplomatic prowess was enviable, truly a man worthy of the title of *consigliori*. There was a low droning noise in the back of her mind, as if it was coming from right behind her—but when she'd turn around, the noise stopped. The dark edges around her vision swirled and crinkled. Did she get enough sleep last night? Hell if she knew.

   Then the pill bottle began to speak to her. It didn't move, nor did it grow any comical appendage that vanished when she blinked. That was a first. “Take one,” It was the voice of her therapist—smooth, calm, and as well-meaning as ever. It reverberated throughout her skull, but she didn't move. “Take one,” it repeated. Its voice was now much lower. A single image smeared itself on her vision like plaster. It replaced the programming windows. An overturned couch in a living room, but all the other furniture was clean and upright. The TV to the left was off, reflecting a bright light to the far left, and the entrance hall light was on—a buzzing, off-amber light that came as splotches rather than a concentrated beam. The rest of the room was tidy, and alien, but strangely familiar. The two other pieces of furniture were upright, but the couch in the middle was overturned. What was this? Had she lived there? When? A horrible sense of *déjà vu* overcame her. Anything beyond the hall was shrouded in darkness, despite the light. In the distance, the glass table in front of the entrance mirror was half-shrouded in darkness. It fragmented, and distorted, slowly devolving into only a hazy, deep-brown light that was nauseating to simply look at. It looked like a compressed file, only distorted and heavily corrupted beyond any physical recognition. But yet it felt like she knew what it was anyway. “Take one,” once more, but this time, the voice had lost its soothing tone. Now, it was more demanding;—desperate, even. It sounded like her, but far, far younger. Five, at the very least, she inferred. “Every three hours, Jade.” 

   It sounded so youthful, so *firm.* Distant, but clear. Far away, yet right in front of her. Firm, but wavering quiet, and timid—like a terrified child’s poor attempt at keeping their voice down while hiding away. Heavily unlike her voice now, scratchy and coarse from years of teenage smoking. Why didn't she move? Why couldn't she move? Jade became like stone, her body would not execute the order to move. Instead, she shook. Violently, at that. The smell of gunpowder invaded her chemosensory receptors, and soon it was the only thing she could smell. Or was it just the nicotine? “Jade,” it called, now once more soothing, like a mother to her child. “Jade,” the voice sent a dull tingle throughout her body, and bile began its burning, agonizingly slow journey up her throat. It now sounded like a police operator calming a panicking, hidden witness while the suspects wrought havoc. It was hollow, emotionless, like they were reading lines from a script rather than making any true effort to calm her down. What officer would take the time out of their days to fully commit to calming down some*thing* that isn't even human? Did they even feel what they felt? Jade found herself asking that question every nightfall. Yet another question that made its residence in her mind without an answer to see it out.

   The drone wanted to scream, to shout—to tell whoever it was to *stop saying her name.* But the words withered to ash in her throat. Perhaps it was fear. Fear that smothered her words before they could tumble from her lips. Fear? No, she had to be fear*less*. She was the older one—just on the sunny side of twenty-three, the very prime of her youth—she was the role model. “Stay calm, and *don't move*,” She had to be fierce, she had to be deadly. She had to be *perfect.* Fearless… Fearless. Why was she afraid now, *what was she so afraid of?* She had the protection, even the favor of one of America’s most powerful families; *what was there to fear?* Jade felt nothing, but everything at the same time, and the question remained unanswered—an indescribable sensation that wrapped around her being like some sort of barrier. Her trembling hands finally obeyed her orders, but instead of reaching for the pill bottle, it betrayed her once more and stretched for the half-smoked cigarette docked in the ashtray to her left, and the worn lighter beside it. Maybe this would calm her nerves anyway, she thought. Smoking had always done that for her. It was all in her mind, after all. She trapped the cigarette between her index and middle finger, grasping the lighter with her free hand. Jade brought the lighter to the cigarette, flicking once, flicking twice. Thrice, a small flame emerged, illuminating her powder white optics. The cigarette glowed, streaks of reddish-orange running across the tar black tobacco like rivers of fire. The drone inhaled, feeling the smoke burn her lungs. The voice—her voice, slowly receded, as if it wasn’t even there in the first place. The image faded, and was replaced by the various windows nearly overpopulating her monitor, still working tirelessly by automation. She plucked the cigarette from her mouth, breathing out wisps of dark gray, which was quickly followed by a sharp, dusty smoker’s cough that slightly jolted her forward in her seat. The cough was a consequence of adopting this crutch of hers, one that clung stubbornly to Jade since the moment she first smoked at sixteen like a bad smell. She knew the cigs would kill her one day—Hell, they were already doing it—but it was great at soothing her nerves. Histrionics wasn't something she was known for, and Jade would much like to keep it that way. One of the live footage displays caught her optic. 

   Reporters—Jade could easily identify them and their variously sized cameras, all clamoring over each other for that perfect shot for their respective media outlets. Jade exhaled, her breath taking form as a small, short-lived cloud of dark gray. Within the swarm of media pukes that had populated one of the many alleyways near *Madison* *St.*, accompanied by cop cars, their respective news channel’s trucks and various news instruments—right near the Seattle Central Library, she spotted a sharp edge. A blade? She zoomed in from the distant street camera that should *not* have been looking their way, then back out. No, it was something else. Their cameras flashed, illuminating the dark alleyway like the flash of a muzzle. Jade leaned forward, squinting her optics. What were they taking pictures of? She couldn’t quite think of anything, mainly because her mind was still reeling from the aftereffects of—whatever that was. Jade knew; she knew full well what it truly was, but a part of herself didn’t want to believe it. She was so young, there was no way she was losing it *this early.* No, it wasn't possible. It shouldn’t even be a thought at all. Twenty-three. Merely twenty-three and with—  

Jade stopped herself from finishing the thought. Her stomach burned and contracted, but she kept her face a mask of neutrality with a hint of that stony, brusque gaze she had built a reputation within the Family for; a skill she had garnered from years’ worth of experience. She kept herself fixated on the screen, fiercely eschewing any other thought from her mind. Or at least, trying to. Her thoughts fluttered to and fro with the pace of a pheasant unable to decide whether to trot along or take flight, before resting on one person, one of the people she loved like a sister: Viktoria. Hospital records in First Hill showed that she was currently having quite the stay in those sterile halls. She had just been admitted for attempted poisoning, the hospital report had read. A bold move, trying to take out someone so close to the Don. It was a slow-acting concoction—the stupid bastard that had spiked her drink had slipped in expired cyanide—but a painful one all the same that left Vik with more of an extremely resentful stomach rather than a quick death as the perp intended.   But on the bright side, Jade thought, barely managing to hold back a wry half-grin that was beginning to take form on her features, it'd probably scare her away from drinking entirely, not that she drank much at all. This incident wouldn’t make the headlines, Vince had made sure of that. If it did, it'd bring some bad media attention onto the Don and gutter Vik’s respect from friends and enemies alike, something Viktoria had painstakingly and ruthlessly built for herself—not just as a drone activist’s adopted daughter, but as an enforcer. It would suggest to the common man and inquisitive journalist that either Vicky had gotten herself entangled in the Yakuza’s web and had done something to warrant retaliation, or Rossi was hiding something deeper; and no reporter, journalist, whatever media job under the sun would pass that by—they’d be drawn to it like a swarm of moths to a large bonfire, especially the ones from the *Times*. *Nosy pricks,* Jade observed resentfully. Mackenzie was a reporter from the *Seattle Times.* About twenty-nine when he died, if the police reports she had accessed the night before were correct. 

   The Faceless Mob couldn’t have either possibility become reality. Vincent was still quite young, per se—just upon the darker side of thirty-nine, crossing the horizon into forty come December—and prided himself on field work as a way to keep his prized USMC physique. But this had only consisted of throwing money at the situation (much to Andolini’s chagrin, he preferred a more… physical way of handling things), something any *caporegime* had in spades. Jade took another drag, exhaling the moment she felt the smoke burn. The man who had poisoned her sister in all but relation was Haruto Ito, an ex-Kurotaka who had confused her for LLORONA—whom he had only heard about via his few remaining connections within the Kurotaka-kai—and was eager to enact retribution in spite of the fact that Jade was masked during the confrontation, most possibly a desperate method of regaining respect and possibly re-entry into the Seattle Yakuza. Now that bastard was dead too. Beaten to a bloody pulp by the Don himself, Jade recalled. She toggled a secure holographic window, scrolling through her secure read mail at lightning speeds before stopping at one, and pulling it up. Sure enough, it reported in chilling detail the death of Haruto Ito, and the denial of the *Kumichō* having any hand in the poisoning. Repeated blunt force trauma to the head. By the time the body was found in a dumpster far away from the *Imperator,* he was physically unrecognizable. It was true, the *Kumichō* didn’t greenlight it. At least Jade hoped so. She closed the window.

   In spite of her current train of thought, shattered like glass to a gunshot, a strange limbo of thinking with a relieving clarity but also a thick midnight's fog that spread its tendrils to every part of the drone’s thought process, rendering her unable to string together any complex thought—Jade was still just as sharp a mind as the shards the shattered panes it produced, even under the restrictions that were so suddenly forced upon her. While the Arroyos were knee-deep in the drug and narcotics business and predictably made millions off of it, the Kurotaka-kai handled arms of all kinds in tandem with the Russians, certainly ironic, given their respective countries’ histories with each other. They were the ones who had the most cutting-edge weaponry the very microsecond it hit shelves, from rifles to the more exotic and pricey rocket launchers and machine guns, no thanks to hundreds of bots and intricate schemes that flung the arms into their hands and in the process threw any and all tails for loops abound. The Kuros, as they were appellated by much of the Family, were a deeply intriguing mix of traditionalism and stunning progressivism, two completely incompatible ideologies that were somehow kept at bay with wondrous efficiency, kept in a precious middle. It was enigmatic how they did it, a riddle whose answer bore just as much elusivity as any member of the Family. But naturally, the ancient, albeit anachronistic, Yakuza traditionalism won out on most grounds. But as a result of that, they had a tendency to take things far too personally, especially if respect is involved—*How ironic,* a part of Jade pointed out with a predictable snarkiness—and thusly, things were very quick to get bloody if the Kurotakas were crossed. Bad for everyone involved, Jade curtly concluded before her thoughts turned to the equivalent of putty once more. It took forcing herself to rise from her seat, the trot down the stabbing cold walnut stairs and a whole cigarette smoked in a single sitting Jade scarcely registered for her mind to rebound just as the final curling vapors faded. 

   The house had fallen into a complete silence, like an audience left wordless even when the melody settled into silence. The reason why she had come down the stairs had fled from her mind, and Jade found herself awkwardly standing on the edge of the first step, tapping her finger on the darkwood railing at irregular intervals. Her relatively modest house—as modest as a *scrap-fucker* like her could get, which was certainly a dream home for her kind—gave an almost scenic view of the round-the-clock bustling I-5 and *Madison St.* that loomed over it. Jade was lucky both sights weren’t blocked off by the towering urban sprawl—truth be told, she had half-expected that to be the case.  It also provided a clear view of the Pike Place Market district and the distant Marriott Waterfront. Jade would have taken numerous visits to the very pricey waterfront if the Arroyos hadn’t—in all practicality—owned the coastline of Seattle up to West Point Lighthouse and was in no mood to share any piece of it, and that it was completely inaccessible to drones. The rest of the Seattle coastline went to the Russians and Kuros, leaving the Bennelis and, consequently, the Rossi Family landlocked. 

   She allowed her powder white optics to drift, slowly scanning up and down the stairs in her peripheral vision even though she knew there was no danger to look out for. A common teaching Don Rossi had ingrained into not just her poor excuse for a brain was always living with caution. Caution was a *mafioso’s* best friend, and it had certainly saved Jade from the grave more times than she bothered to count. *What did I come down here for?* She wondered. Her thought process worked at the pace of an asthmatic snail. The sharpness Jade had not mere minutes ago exhibited had vanished as if she had just been reset. Something in the corner of her vision shifted, and against every instinct, reflex, and commandment years in the Family had instilled in her; she went rigid, as still and stiff as board. The only thing that moved was her arm, like it had a mind of its own. It flew to her neck, grasping at her necklace—a silver cross necklace she should’ve yanked off her neck long ago, and the only memory of whoever she stayed with before… Before what? *The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want…*

  The old Psalm populated her barren and fogged mind before she could stop it. What good would it serve, when years of repeating it each night only to lay awake far past midnight was the only result it had shown? It was the reason she stopped praying when she hit seventeen. Years and years of entreaties and sinking her head into the Bible she had stuffed away in some forgotten corner of her old room for hours on end when she wasn’t out “persuading” business owners to pay up had amounted to naught. They had flown up to the night sky and wilted in the air. Why hadn't God taken her *out* of this “life,” as they called it? Her grip tightened on the foot of the small cross, but her shoulder only shook. For years, it had been problem after problem—not that she could remember much of it, anyway—and what had God done? Nothing, precisely nothing. Sat back in his plush, golden throne room flocked by angels, leaned back and laughed at every mistake, every fuck up, every tear Jade had blundered herself into. Why couldn’t He pull her up from the waves, like He did with Peter—Or was it Paul? Jade couldn’t remember—spread his arms out and just say the words; those words that rendered a whole raging typhoon of a sea to a docile pond that produced not a single ripple? For all the times she had spent minutes—*eternities*—praying, the only answer she had ever gotten was a brush of cold air. The corner of  Jade’s lips twitched in an attempt to form itself into a scowl. *What did I do to deserve this?*  

“***I can think of a few things,***” There was that voice again. As if it was right beside her, casually interjecting as if it could read her mind—a faint, hollow echo that sounded like it was coming from another room. It *was* her mind, after all. How does one keep secrets from one’s own mind? What was supposed to be a shudder only came out as a poorly controlled tremor, and her grip tightened once more on the necklace. Her body remained stock-still. The cool air that poured from somewhere in the house brushed against her casing, slithering up her light brown sweater she always wore when she was home. The moment the blades licked her skin her body lost its rigidness, and in an instant she turned on her heel and quite mindlessly trotted back up the stairs as if nothing had happened. It was a cycle Jade had learned to live with: A rush of being, then nothingness. The inability to think properly at all—maybe for hours, maybe for a day or two—then in a flash, it returns, accompanied by rapid-fire images ranging from every single worst-case scenario Jade’s mind had ever constructed, some as outlandish and simplistic as a child’s fear of the dark, others—   Jade shook her head with such intensity she thought her neck would snap. Her foot caught on the large triangular step marking the beginning of the short flight of stairs that led to the upstairs region of the house. The possibilities and rationalizations once again started their sprint back and forth: Had someone rigged anything? Would her next step be her last? Her throat dried, sparking a dull burn in the back that was quick to spread downward, and she froze mid-step. Questions that zoomed about like sugar-highed children played table tennis with her ability to quickly decipher them. Hadn’t she painstakingly checked and re-checked nearly the whole house just an hour before she retreated to her desk? Her mind once more flashed with warbled, flickering dreams of slamming her fist against the nearest solid surface, but her muscles only tensed up. The other choices had melted into incomprehensibility, a stream of unrelated questions and what-ifs that collided with the stifling void that rested in the pit of her stomach along with the dulled acidic burn of caffeine from the coffee she had ingested no short of a couple hours ago.

The acrid phantom stench of cigarette smoke burned her chemosensory receptors—a familiar burn, one that failed to draw a cough from her dully scratching throat. *Maybe someone had spiked that too,* she offhandedly thought. *Maybe I’ll be dead in the next couple minutes.* She mentally snickered like an upstart schoolgirl setting eyes on prey. *Wouldn’t that be nice.* Her mind attempted to scrawl up what death would be like. Perhaps it was just like the end of an old black and white movie. Maybe she’d hear the faint squealing of white noise. Maybe she’d still be there, floating and drenched in a suffocating black that kept wrapping itself around her and squeezing until she forgot she even existed before this. Perpetually drowning ‘neath a lake of blackened waves and infinite depth—unable to see, hear, even scream. It was the only string of possibilities Jade didn’t bother trying to force out of her brain’s projector room. It’d be a hopeless fight anyway, much like with all of the other barbarous intrusions. The good part was that it faded away within the hour. Her vision lost its focus, the world’s edges smudged somewhat. She blinked—once, twice, thrice—everything regained its definition, then drooped once again. Her field of vision hadn’t lost its sharpness this time, only it had merely lost its focus. Jade leaned on the railing, scarcely registering that she had fully climbed upstairs or the icy press of the wood. Her gaze floated down to the opaque rectangular windows parallel to the front door, trying to see through the blurred glass. Anything beyond the window looked like a hazy, vague painting splattered onto the pavement by some irresponsible oaf. A self-toggled AR window pulled itself up without as much as a *ding* precipitating it, nearly making the young drone noticeably jump backwards. Nearly.   

It was merely a *Times* newsletter she had forgotten to turn off auto-display on—a journalist rambling on and on about some… Wait a damn minute. Jade’s gaze sharpened, and she carefully scanned the article, jumping past the ads unabashedly displaying women in barely-there dresses. Then again. And again. **FBI WATCHER SHOT DOWN IN DOWNTOWN SEATTLE**, the title read in full, bold text. Her mind flashed back to that blade—in the first, and possibly last show of cooperation for this whole day—no, Watcher. That was what had been shot down? Those things were supposed to be far too quick for a bullet, Jade recalled from what she and her team had gathered. But it did have a *very* short break period and a predictable, pre-directed route. If what was in the article was indeed true—though she took the news with more than an inch of salt—then Uzi had attracted the attention of the Bureau. Fear surged through Jade’s veins. *Not good. Not good.* She dashed off to her room,  throwing on a firmly crumpled but never worn ripped denim jacket over her black long-sleeve undershirt, jeans to match, and a *Superunknown* baseball cap—she had kept it ever since a then-seventeen year old Uzi had gifted her the hat and the vinyl for her twenty-first birthday after months spent saving; both of which she had taken a liking to. The hat pressed her silverish-white pigtails down, creating a dull pressure that served more to annoy than inflict pain. The purple-haired youngster would still be stuck in the academic purgatory that was the University of Seattle, Jade’s mind interjected in a rare attempt to sooth her spiked nerves. Uzi wouldn’t exactly be a *prime* suspect given her circumstance. After all, there were thousands of drones in Seattle to falsely accuse of this incident. *Maybe it was someone else?* Jade hoped with all of what remained of her soul that that was indeed the case. Jade quickly pulled up a secure messaging network directly linked to Don Rossi; the messages would be deleted within the next thirty minutes, leaving no trace behind for anyone at all.   

**GUESS WHO’S IN TOWN.** She typed, quickly following it up with the link to the news article as she darted down the steps. She stopped short on the last one, planting the rim of her palm on the corner of the wall. In a second, a block of what was to the uneducated observer simply drywall folded back and slowly elevated upward, locking in place. It revealed a small, musty-smelling wooden compartment and a well taken care of *M1911.* Jade swiped the sleek black gun from its holding place, sticking a finger up between the inner drywall and the faux one. She clicked a button intelligently hidden between the two with the tip of her finger and quickly retracted her hand just as the block slowly came back down and locked in place. Jade had quickly learned to never leave the house without the gun, save for a few exceptions. The drone adroitly stashed the small pistol away in her inner jacket pocket—any other gun would be far too obvious, given her choice of clothing. Just enough to be an adequate shield to the November elements; but not thick enough to hide away a revolver. The lock was Jade’s own brainchild, an intricate fingerprint lock hidden away in plain sight that only used the side of her palm and played into her habit of pressing the side of her palm on the corner wall that marked the beginning of the stairwell. Habits were a fatal thing to have in “The Life”—worse than any bullet or blade, but Jade kept some of them anyway, mainly due to her therapist endorsing them as a way to keep her “grounded.” The natural exception being her relationship with the “cancer sticks.” She slipped into a pair of black *Air Forces*, wrapping her hand around the silver knob that separated her house from her small garage.

  Jade pressed her body against the door, straining her auditory receptors for anything that would indicate an unwanted surprise on the other side. She had more than a significant amount of precautions for a situation like that, but one could never be too sure. *Better safe than sorry,* the youngster repeated as she inched the door open. Her optics squeezed shut, and she took a sharp breath. No click. No explosion that would render her a puddle of tar black paste and burnt to a crisp clothing on her wall. Only silence that seemed to stretch on until the end of time. She exhaled heavily, and fully pulled the door open, trotting down the short three-step that led into the garage. Besides the evident stench of petrol and engine oil, a stylish navy blue 3070 Beamer sat patiently in the middle of the surprisingly clean garage. Light filtered in from the small windows atop the garage door, casting just enough of a glow to identify any bomb planted—to Jade’s relief, there was none. It didn’t stop her from stooping down and spending the better half of ten minutes checking herself, however. Just like the light had demonstrated, there were indeed no explosives lying in wait under her car. The drone straightened up, pressing her finger against the driver’s window barrier and watching the car start up. The door popped open. “**GOOD AFTERNOON, MRS. ROSSI.**” The automated voice welcomed as Jade climbed inside. She pulled up yet another window, running streams of white colored code and punching in a string of programming and closing out the window. The moment the window was closed, the garage door flipped open with a jarring speed, and light beamed into the car. Jade squinted her eyes, pulling out of the garage despite the blinding midday sunlight and expertly pulling her car into traffic heading northward on *Boren Avenue.* The reply had taken a while, but not too long. It was merely the notification’s trill that made her arm twitch as she perlocated through the columns of traffic and blazing red brake lights: **DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT. THEY WOULDN’T KNOW.**     
  
 Jade hoped he was right.

Should I (33m) go ahead and end it? ,"So me and the girl I’m dating (28) made plans to go to a New Year’s Eve party with her friends then the next day do something alone bc I voiced I wanted to do that. This was done 2 weeks prior.

On New Year’s Eve she asked if we could go to a party with her friends on New Year’s Day just for an hour around 1. I said sure let’s go 2 hours and we can do something else together that day.

So the day roles around and we get lunch and coffee. It ended up being we couldn’t get there till 5 bc her friends slept in too late. I voiced how I messed up and should’ve made plans to do a real activity aside from typical lunch. I don’t view that as a date activity to get to know someone really. My gf replied “well we still hung out and got lunch” and I said “yea but not what i envisioned. I’m partly to blame bc I didn’t plan the timing right and we laid in bed all morning but it just fucking sucks we can’t do a couple activity together today bc your friends decided to start the party later and we were supposed to go at 1. I’m not blaming you for anything though” she  said something I forgot but storms off angrily and doesn’t acknowledge my feelings. Keep in mind this whole time I never got “i appreciate you changing plans” or anything. I felt pretty unseen or understood.

So I follow her to the kitchen and ask calmly “what are you thinking” she doesn’t reply and ignores me. So I walk outside to cool down bc now I’m upset she’s IGNORING me. I come back inside and she’s mad at me and said I stormed off and claims she didn’t hear me when I asked “what are you thinking”. This argument blows up and then it’s resolved.
She never once acknowledged my feelings on not being able to spend time doing a couple activity. Never once acknowledges that i changed Plans for her and had no issue with it.
It’s like she didn’t even care that i was disappointed we couldn’t do a couples activity even when i told her it’s partially my fault for not making plans and im not trying to blame her. 

I feel like she was just thinking about herself. 

We talked about this a day later and she accused me of not saying sorry for something I did during that argument. I absolutely said sorry in the moment and profusely apologized and said it wasn’t right and she is right. I told her this and pushed back. Then she changed the subject into something else i did. 

Is this a waste of time?

He complimented my smile and we chatted about some shared interests. He asked for my number and then asked if I wanted to go for a coffee after my dinner with friends. That was our first 'date' I guess, the coffee shop wasn't open so we just chatted in my car about life and everything. This was the first 'date' I've had since I got divorced a year ago. 

However, I got some off feelings from him. When I said I had to head home, he came in for a hug and I hugged him back. Then he started kissing down my neck and I pulled back, so he tried to go for my lips. I turned so he got my cheek and we said our goodbyes. 

We texted back and forth a bit and he was going to be out in my general area for a meeting (I live out of the city where he lives). The restaurant wasn't open due to holidays so he suggested he swing by my place to hang out. I wasn't comfortable with that and sent him a text saying so and mentioned only public meet ups. He didn't respond after that and I think I'm not ready to do any dating at this point. 

Does it sound like this guy is just out for sex? He seemed generally pretty great until he started trying for a kiss. Why would he suggest coming over to my place when it's only been 3 days since we actually met? ",8,1735965963.0,AskWomenOver30,13,0.84,False

It was positive. Being the, maybe neurotic person I am, I took 3 more - all positive. I was beyond thrilled. I laughed that unbelievable laugh - from my gut. I called my fiancé and laughed some more. 

On December 15th my kids father (two teenagers from a relationship that never resulted in marriage and ended with me having sole custody in 2012) text me to ask me to coffee to discuss the move I had just sent to court. I am engaged to the love of my life, also, unfortunately, laid off in October so paying rent and bills is a struggle, so I have decided the best option is to move to southern Oregon for a new job and better schools - on 12/02/24 I asked the father to meet in person. I told him
About the move and reasons and that I felt it was best to come to him in person rather than go through the courts and catch him off guard. He said he was appreciative. And heard me out. I said I would be willing to do the transporting to and from, every other weekend, to bring the kids to him so he didn’t have to drive. He acted like he agreed. Thanked me. And left

On 12/15/24 he asked to meet for coffee to discuss “the details” and I quickly agreed. I waited at Starbucks with his coffee … only to have his sister walk in - and  serve me with papers to stop the move.

On December 17th 2024 - I went to the court to file my response to his court documents - before I left my apartment I stated bleeding …. It took 3 weeks and 7 blood tests and 3 ultrasounds finally ending in a pregnancy that was not progressing after the 17th…. Even though hcg levels slowly progressed. I had to have an aspiration to clear my uterus yesterday and I feel numb. 

I want to not be bitter. I want to not be heartbroken. I feel silly and overly emotionally ridiculous. I also just want a hug. I also just want to not feel like a burden. All of this happened over the holidays and I felt like I ruined things my being too into myself (quiet - not me. Withdrawn - not me). 

I needed to vent. Thank you for giving me the place to do so.

1ht6h8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1ht6h8g/should_i_apologize_years_later/,Should I apologize years later? ,"About 5 years ago I made a friend online and we quickly grew close. After a few months of a really great friendship, she began to be cast out by a friend she was extremely attached to and the anxiety and depression that stemmed from that quickly took over her life and our friendship. Most of our conversations started to centre around how horrible she felt over losing this friend, conversations she had with this ex friend, and various other problems big and small. It got to the point where she would send distressing text messages and go awol for hours and I would be minutes away from calling her local police for a wellness check before she popped back to say she went for a coffee run. I felt resentful that in this grief and turmoil that she felt for her ex-friend, she really stopped being a good friend to me and our other friend. 

All of this became really overwhelming and unpleasant for me and I started quietly distancing myself from the friendship. I think I sent her a long message explaining why when she approached me and putting down some boundaries together, but the friendship I once loved continued in that uncomfortable direction. At the time, she knew that she overstepped explicit boundaries and that I wasn’t happy about it. All to say, I may have slow ghosted, but she knew why and might have some closure from those conversations that she is at peace with. I wasn’t a teenager anymore, but I’ve still matured considerably in the past four years. We don’t have each other blocked, so I know I could reach out, but I’m hesitating over my motives and whether or not I should let sleeping dogs lie. I want to tell her that I know I hurt her deeply when I abandoned our friendship when she was already struggling, and I’ve thought about her and how she didn’t deserve that often in the past years. I don’t intend to shift any blame onto her or explain why I removed myself from the friendship; I really just want to apologize for being kind of a dick. 

I think it would be nice to keep up with each other’s lives and be happy for our wins, but I don’t know that I want to go back to being close friends with the woman I knew 5 years ago (though she might have matured a bit just as I did). I don’t want it to be an apology fully motivated by guilt and meant to make myself feel better, and I can’t say with 100% certainty if she would appreciate me reaching out out of the blue. I also have OCD and feel a strong compulsion to confess to things (thank you religious upbringing) which might bias my opinion in an unproductive direction. ",2,1735965311.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False
1ht6gz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ht6gz9/support_needed/,Support needed,"Hey all! I'm a 40 year old guy who was only diagnosed at 36. I was denied diagnosis by my mom who didn't want another disabled child. My older sister has cerebral palsy. Throughout my life my mother would stop my stims and tell me to ""stop acting like your sister! You're not like your sister!"" It's like mom truly believed you could catch mental disabilities from others. 

I was also bullied relentlessly for my traits like, talking to myself and not realizing I was doing it, or my inability to mirror back what they expect of me. I don't smile much, never have due to the suffering. I have always struggled to find my glimmers. 

I don't know what makes me happy. Like, I've noticed a lot of other autistic people seem to have stims that help them elevate their mood. I simply don't have those right now. For 5 years it was coffee until I lost the job. And I loved coffee work. I'm struggling to get back to it. 

I struggle now with food intake, emotional regulation, and feeling like I have been understood. I try not to over explain myself because it feels like I'm being condescending like people should know these general things about autism but I'm finding people really don't understand it. I am only just starting to understand better. 

I have a ton of internalized ablism and I don't know how to love myself because of that. I truly don't care if I seem more autistic to others as long as I'm happy! I fought for diagnosis so I could receive validation, so that I could tell people. I do X because I'm autistic and that needs respect. But like, my needs seem to be changing a lot right now. I'm trying to figure myself out again at 40 and I feel stupid and like I shouldn't be doing teenage exploration at this age. 

But I also feel that's self critical. I didn't get a healthy childhood. My parents did try and I think they did a great job for the most part, but all the ablism I could have went without. 

First sign, for me, that I have always had autism was when I was 3 our family cat had kittens and my mom was complaining to my uncle and he joked I should kill the cats. Mom found me with a coal shovel, I'll leave it at that to spare the trauma dump but yeah I didn't know he was joking. I was just doing as I was told and that is also the origin story of why I'm a warrior and not a soldier. Soldiers do what they're told by a government. Warriors fight for those who need them. 

Anyway, all of this to ask, those of you who were also late diagnosed, how? How do you feel safe unmasking and finding yourself. I'm going to do this while alone and update my partner. I need them to know because they've said I'm more autistic since my diagnosis, but I only got the diagnosis because I was almost burned out. I burned out when I started trying to figure myself while on the job. Now I'm jobless so I have the time and opportunity. 

Please help me. What are some possible happy stims I can try? How do I recognize if it does actually inspire dopamine? I know I'm very big into muscle memory and sound but I'm really struggling to know myself even though I have people fooled they think I do know me. ",2,1735965286.0,autism,1,1.0,False

Moving to or living in a city as big as Toronto can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re trying to build genuine connections. That’s where this group comes in. Whether you’re into exploring the city’s food scene, hitting up the best hidden gems for live music, or just vibing at the waterfront with a coffee in hand, I’d love to meet people who bring good energy and big laughs.

I’m all about good vibes, bold ideas, and a little mischief along the way—so if you’ve got a great sense of humor or a knack for spontaneity, you’re already my kind of people. Oh, and speaking of bold ideas… I’ve been working on some creative content lately that might be a little daring. Let’s just say I’m open to collaborations—if you’re confident, creative, and maybe not too camera shy.

So, let’s get talking! Tell me your favorite spots in the city, your hidden talents, or what inspires you to step out of your comfort zone. I’m here to make meaningful connections (and maybe a few adventurous ones too). Let’s build something awesome together!

At first tablets (oral meds) worked and then eventually that stopped working for me and from 2023 I started using insulin. I am not overweight but I have really bad eating habits. I love sweets and carbs and while I don’t take sugar in my coffees and use sweeteners lmao I still eat a lot of chocolates and can’t help myself, even after having a healthy meal. I find it surprising I’m not able to stop myself and take it seriously even knowing that I have this condition and having sweets like this will lead to high blood sugars which is bad for me. I often read posts on this sub Reddit and don’t relate to the thing of saying no to certain meals which many be carb or sugar heavy while eating outside, or the notion of “missing” eating or drinking certain food items now that you’re diabetic since I literally eat everything, the only thing I have given up completely is soft drinks and that’s only cause I can have diet versions. I will definitely speak to a dietician but how do you all commit to avoiding carb/sugar heavy food even if you have insulin and stay disciplined? I think I’m too reliant on insulin and think I can have anything just because I have insulin but my high HBA1C definitely says otherwise. I feel like that wake up call hasn’t hit me yet like I know what I’m doing is not good for me and want to stop but I don’t have a high enough willpower to completely cut out sweets and other such things.

- **Travel Enthusiast**: I have a deep love for travel and have been fortunate enough to do a bit. I can’t wait to go on my next adventure. Hopefully you’d be my travel partner.

- **Movie Buff**: Films are a window into other worlds and perspectives. There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good movie and then discussing it in-depth with someone who shares the same passion.

- **Social Butterfly**: I believe that life is best lived in good company. Whether it's a casual coffee date or a relaxed evening, I'm always up for socializing and making new connections.

- **Board Game Aficionado**: There's something magical about gathering around a table with friends or family for a board game night. I enjoy a wide variety of games, from strategic games to cooperative adventures. 

### What I’m Looking For
I'm searching for someone who I can go out on cute dates with and is ready to embark on new adventures together. A genuine, kind-hearted, and open-minded person who values honesty, trust, and communication. Someone who appreciates both the thrill of spontaneous adventures and well planned trips.
