1h9ai98,https://www.reddit.com/r/utis/comments/1h9ai98/are_these_common_uti_symptoms/,Are these common uti symptoms?,"I have not gone to a urologist yet but will be seeing one shortly. A nurse at a clinic told me I just have cystitis and to drink loads of water but it‚Äôs been almost a week since then and I still have some weird symptoms, but less pain when urinating now.
I have the usual-
- pain when peeing
- cloudy pee
- needing to pee more than usual
- strong smelling urine
But this is what I‚Äôm worried about-
- pink tinge to final drops of urine when I go

-fleshy bits coming out when I pee
-mild itching feeling after peeing.

To be honest I‚Äôm only really worried about the last two symptoms and the fact it hasn‚Äôt gone away in a while. Are these normal uti symptoms? Are they symptoms of anything else? Will a urologist give me antibiotics, will they get rid of these symptoms immediately?
I‚Äôm aware that these questions can only be answered by a professional but until then I want some ease of mind because I‚Äôm really stressing over the fact I‚Äôm peeing out bits of tissue.

This suburb is so overachieving that even the squirrels are probably stress-testing their acorns for winter. Let‚Äôs not forget its identity crisis: is it a town, a city, or just a glorified cul-de-sac with zoning issues? Newton tries so hard to be Boston‚Äôs sophisticated cousin but ends up feeling more like Boston‚Äôs awkward middle child who got into Harvard by legacy.

Newton brags about its ‚Äúvillage‚Äù system‚Äî14 villages, no less‚Äîbut calling them villages is like calling a Starbucks a mom-and-pop coffee shop. Waban? It‚Äôs a glorified strip of overpriced real estate with a train stop. Chestnut Hill? Not even really in Newton, but sure, take credit for the mall. And don‚Äôt get me started on Newton Centre: the epicenter of ‚ÄúCan I speak to your manager?‚Äù vibes.

The city‚Äôs motto might as well be Where Fun Goes to Die. Think of the liveliest thing happening there: a book club meeting where everyone discusses their Peloton leaderboard positions instead of the book. Oh, wait! There‚Äôs the annual Newton Harvest Fair‚Äîbecause nothing screams excitement like face painting, pumpkin bread, and artisanal candles.

The public schools? Top-notch academically, sure, but socially, they‚Äôre a Hunger Games arena of over-scheduled, over-caffeinated teens jockeying for Ivy League admission. Forget recess; these kids are comparing who got the higher score on their AP Calculus exam during lunch. Meanwhile, their parents are busy gatekeeping the Whole Foods parking lot with the intensity of a Cold War diplomat.

And the housing prices? Don‚Äôt even think about moving there unless you‚Äôve got a hedge fund or a trust fund. Newton‚Äôs real estate market is like a high-stakes auction where the winning bid is your firstborn child and a kidney. You‚Äôre not buying a house; you‚Äôre buying the privilege to pay for property taxes so high they might as well include a diploma from MIT.

Even Mother Nature is over it‚Äîwhy does every snowstorm seem to dump an extra three inches on Newton compared to the rest of the state? Probably because the weather gods are sick of hearing Newton residents complain about how hard it is to drive their BMW X5s in the snow.

So here‚Äôs to Newton, the suburb that wants to be a city but ends up being a theme park for Type-A personalities. Keep polishing those white picket fences, Newtonians‚Äîjust don‚Äôt trip over your sense of self-importance on your morning jog.",3,1733630780.0,newtonma,0,1.0,False

Customers were usually very nice, and I normally worked the closing shift, which was pretty uneventful, but then got asked to start working mornings. My first new shift working the register, someone came in with their small little posh dog, with nothing indicating it was a service animal or even ESA, ordered a cappuccino in a mug, then went to go sit down, expecting his coffee to be brought to him (not something we normally do). After the transaction, he left to go sit down, and when the next customer stepped up, they noticed he left his card in the reader. I tried getting his attention before he sat down, but he was studiously ignoring us thinking he was above the people who worked there. Whatever, once his drink was made, I brought it over to him with the card, and passively mentioned that we don‚Äôt allow dogs inside the store unless they‚Äôre service dogs, and we have a nice outdoor patio that they can sit at instead. While this dog was climbing unleashed all over our couches (it was a pretty cute and well-behaved dog at least), this man screams at me that he was a regular and no one had ever told him he couldn‚Äôt have his dog inside (it‚Äôs posted on all entrances).

Hope you enjoy what I've written, looking to meet & talk to others who also love discovering new artists & music!!

----------
There is a ton of rage one can internalize over a bad situation. Stretch out that timeline, and what one ends up with is a rough gallery of emotions, swelled up and eager to bite. Alicia Glass, a newly-minted rock artist out of Durango, Colorado, does a phenomenal job of encapsulating those feelings and situations in her October debut, the Close/Open EP.

Over the four tracks, there is a silent screaming toxicity, not necessarily from the artist, but from the situations and happenings that can pull us under, and the songs here are the revolt at the end of the cycle.

Kicking off the record, ‚ÄúBad Friend‚Äù is jilted and jaded, with the figure at the center succumbing to her own negativity and influences. There‚Äôs an apathy tinged throughout the soulful vocals Glass puts so much power into that is palatable, giving a haunting quality to a perspective of how even knowing why we do things sometimes doesn‚Äôt help deviate from certain actions. Not necessarily a vouching for, but more an ‚Äúis what it is‚Äù type of telling.

‚ÄúTrailer Park Queen‚Äù is a bit softer of a track, as far as instrumentals. The lyrics speak to much of what Glass seems to feel and perceive, caught in a situation that seems inescapable, again commenting on her sad state of affairs before ending the song, reprising through wails to her audience, ‚ÄúI just want to be free‚Äù.

One of the standout tracks, ‚ÄúI Live In The Garage‚Äù, hits harder rock notes throughout as Glass splits between storytelling and song lyrics. There is a narrative Glass uses for the beginning, loosely based on a friend‚Äôs real experience, where a neighbor tries to encroach on, in the song‚Äôs variant, Glass‚Äôs living situation as she‚Äôs trying to eat, sparking a backlash that is both humorous and all too familiar. Between the spoken words at both the back and front, the singer lays out issues like a laundry list, and in a the tight economy we live in, there is much to relate to within the verses.

‚ÄúThree dollars on a coffee adds up/Yeah, that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt get ahead/when I worked 70 hours last week/still can‚Äôt afford my rent/my car keeps breaking down/third time this week/I just keep couching it up/takes three extra hours on the bus/time is money and there‚Äôs never enough/‚Äù

The biggest gut punch, however, comes in from ‚ÄúBurrito‚Äù. There is a strong feeling of tired aggravation that pops in all over the EP, filtered differently for each song, but ‚ÄúBurrito‚Äù, right next to ‚ÄúI Live In The Garage‚Äù, holds very little back. The stress off the vocals builds up on each set of verses, almost to the point that there seems to be an audible pleading in Glass‚Äôs voice. There is a line that is repeated differently in the second verse set, ‚Äúhalf the lights are burned out/and so am I.‚Äù

Once heard, I was shaken and immediately felt an overwhelming desire to scream, ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù ‚ÄúBurrito‚Äù depicts stress at its peak, causing for the listener a variety of feelings, from empathy to sympathy, and also solidarity. For anyone who has ever been at wits‚Äô end, ending up riled over sleepless nights with days being practically on edge, this song carries like a flare up in the sky, trying to find help and relief but getting none.

For her debut mini-collection, Alicia Glass knocks it out of the park with her ability to reach well beyond her words into the audience‚Äôs pain. However, it isn‚Äôt in a way that seems overly emotional, instead coming in like a close friend trying to tell you what is going on, sounding so familiar that it might as well be the two parties sitting outside for a smoke.

Punishing, powerful, but honest in a way that is engaging, and in a manner that allows listeners to scream, cry, and laugh at the madness of it all. By the end of the EP, listeners will feel like they‚Äôd gotten a lot out of their system, ready to tackle it all again, but hopefully find the freedom to shake off what‚Äôs been ailing them. Close/Open is a set of songs that I know I can turn to if I just need something to relate to after fighting so hard to carry on in the worst of times, and Glass will be there to empathize with the storm of bullshit our daily lives can sometimes become.",1,1733629598.0,LetsTalkMusic,0,0.67,False
1h9a38l,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/1h9a38l/gta_san_andreas_is_better_than_gta_5/,GTA San Andreas is better than GTA 5.,"Recently, I deleted GTA 5 off of my computer. Mainly for 4 reasons. 1: I Barely play the game. 2: I was desperate for storage space since my disk was filled to brim, and I mean it, and it was because of the shitty GTA 5 left abandoned and it's main purpose is to fill up storage. 3: The game isn't fun anymore (I'll get to that later). And 4: The biggest reason was because San Andreas was way better by 1000 Miles in terms of everything except for graphics. GTA 5 honestly has way better graphics than San Andreas. But keep in mind that San Andreas was made in 2004, don't let that fool you. And remember kids, better graphics doesn't mean better game. Take a look at the GTA Series. Excluding graphics, San Andreas was better in everything because it honestly had way more stuff to do like the side missions which was an easy way to make money. The minigames, San Andreas had more and better minigames like Basketball, Lowrider Challenges, Arcade Games, and even Casino Games. To be honest, GTA 5 also had good minigames, but it's not beating San Andreas. The body/fighting mechanics, In San Andreas, you can eat at different restaurants all across the map, and it's nut just for cosmetics either because you can even get fat and loose weight by running around for a long time (Not recommended), or by exercising in one of the many gyms across the map or use the gym equipment at the beach. Also in the gyms, you can learn new moves like Boxing in Los Santos, Kung Fu in San Fierro, and Kickboxing in Las Venturas, which honestly makes fighting fun in San Andreas, also in San Andreas, you can do crazy parkour, something that GTA 5 doesn't have. GTA 5 also doesn't have working gym equipment, your body is always the same no matter how long you run for, Good Fighting Mechanics because in GTA 5, you only have a right hand punch and a right leg kick, which makes fighting more bland in the game, but I'll let it slide since not many people notices it since they're more focused on the fighting itself, and worst of all, Severely Limited Food Options, In GTA 5, you can only eat Gas Station foods and drink soda. Most of the restaurants still exist such as Cluckin Bell and Burger Shot, but you can't enter them, you also can't get fat no matter how hard you try. Safehouses. In GTA San Andreas, you can buy safe houses all across the map, and they each have their own unique interior. In GTA 5, you can't buy safe houses, even if you call the phone number, they will say to stop prank calling you. Car Mods/Customization. Now, I know most of you will be mad at me for this but the Car Customization options in GTA San Andreas are better than in GTA 5. In San Andreas, you can add stuff like the usual paint jobs, stickers, tires and more, but things that San Andreas has that GTA 5 doesn't are the Hydraulics, and the Nitro, also the nitro in GTA San Andreas has motion blur, but I like it because it gives out a fast effect like speed. GTA 5 also had pretty good customization options, but it's not beating San Andreas in my opinion. There are a bunch of things that San Andreas had that GTA 5 didn't have such as Multiple Major Cities, and because of this, you can travel to each city by Plane as a passenger, same thing can be said for the train. Speaking of which, Trains because in San Andreas, not only you can ride it as a passenger, but also drive the train and even derail it. In GTA 5, you can't even drive the train, you can ride the tram as a passenger. Diverse Weather/Biomes such as the Orange Tint of Los Santos with the iconic skyline, The Foggy Mornings of San Fierro, all the way to the sandstorms in the desert. GTA 5 only has Los Santos and a few other small towns and only Rain/Thunder as the only weather options. More weapons such as the Chainsaw, Katana, Flamethrower and more. Girlfriends, In GTA San Andreas, there are a bunch of girlfriends across the map. You can even take them on a date, they can even file a divorce, and you can even have hot coffee (we don't talk about that, it was for the better it got removed). Most importantly, being the storyline. GTA San Andreas has a better storyline in my opinion and it also has more missions than GTA 5, some of you might find it as a disadvantage, but more missions mean a better storyline, but the most important thing about this is after the story, because if you finished every single mission in GTA 5, there isn't much stuff to do other than starting crazy police chases. Yeah most times, the game can get pretty boring after you finish the storyline and exploring the whole map for every easter egg and nooks and crannies. So basically, little to no fun after you finish everything. However, after you finish the GTA San Andreas Storyline, with all of the features I mentioned plus a bunch of others. The game is still pretty fun, even after you finish the story, which is why GTA San Andreas can never truly die and can never be downgraded except for definitive edition. It was a buggy mess at launch almost identical to Cyberpunk 2077, at least it made the graphics somewhat good. But not on GTA 5 or even GTA 4 level graphics. At least Grove Street Games, or should I say Grove Shit Games learned from their mistakes and improved it. But it's still kinda shit, even after the improvements. I still bought it on my Switch because it's still recognized as GTA San Andreas, just with a bunch of bugs. So yeah, what do I recommend. GTA 5 for Graphics and ""realism,"" and GTA San Andreas if you don't care about the graphics and just care about the gameplay like me. I'm gonna say it for the last time. GTA San Andreas is better than GTA 5 in everything except for Graphics. GTA 5 can get boring, especially after you finish the story and explore the whole map.

1h99wqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h99wqe/cmv_everyone_manipulates_everyone/,CMV: Everyone manipulates everyone,"People manipulate each other consciously or subconsciously constantly. And yes manipulation also happens subconsciously constantly because at some point any conscious behavior is done subconsciously if done often enough or if certain patterns are learned early enough. The definition is ""controlling someone or something to your own advantage, often unfairly or dishonestly"". B buys C a coffee because B has learned in his life that this act is going to make people friendly towards him, he is using a manipulation strategy. In the real world no one would describe someone buying someone else a coffee a manipulation strategy. At least only till they do. People selectively decide what is manipulation based on feelings and how much they dislike something, often after the fact. Hell, I will even go so far that common terms describing malicious manipulation like ""gaslighting"" are nowadays weaponized for manipulation. As in someone is gaslighting someone into believing they gaslighted someone. 

My point is that manipulation is omnipresent in society and only selectively called out under specific circumstances. Everyone does it all the time, often without realizing it. Too many people inherently see manipulation as an evil word. Because they feel the act is so inherently malicious they refuse to believe that people constantly manipulate each other. You have to sell it to them. Instead of calling it manipulation you call it ""they are showing how much they care"" or ""it was just a white lie"". But now make them have a fight and ""showing how much they care"" transforms into ""they coldly manipulated me into liking them"" and a white lie becomes ""they lied into my face!!!"". 

I know people will try reframing what I consider as manipulation into something else, something that sounds nicer. But if you do then please also explain how this makes actions immune to counter framing, people claiming they were manipulated and surprisingly it always sounds reasonable under the right circumstances no matter the gesture. I believe that's because we actually do manipulate each other constantly. We just have to let go of the frame that manipulation is inherently malicious instead of just a basic human interaction.",0,1733628905.0,changemyview,10,0.36,False

I wanted to share my experience and knowledge about traveling from Salt Lake City to Zion National Park since I've made this trip multiple times and learned quite a bit along the way.

The direct driving distance from Salt Lake City to Zion National Park is about 308 miles, and it typically takes around 4.5 hours if you're driving non-stop. But honestly, who wants to rush through such a beautiful journey?

I've found that the best route is taking I-15 South straight through. The highway is well-maintained, and you'll pass through some pretty incredible landscapes. You'll see everything from urban areas to desert valleys and red rock formations that'll make you want to stop for photos.

Speaking from experience, I recommend breaking up the trip into segments. There are several cool stops along the way, like the city of Provo (great for a coffee break) and the charming town of St. George, which is just about an hour from Zion.

Here's a pro tip: if you're planning to visit Zion, I highly recommend booking your activities in advance. Last summer, I waited until the last minute and missed out on some awesome hiking tours. Now I always book through https://athometouch.com/zionpark - they've got some really great deals on guided tours and activities.

The best time to make this drive is during spring or fall. Summer can get intensely hot, and winter might have snow in some areas, especially around Salt Lake City. I learned this the hard way when I made the trip in July - the heat was pretty brutal!

Transportation options:
- Driving your own car (most flexible)
- Renting a car (great if you're flying into SLC)
- Guided tours (check out https://athometouch.com/zionpark for some awesome options)
- Shuttle services (less common but available)

One thing that surprised me was how different the temperature can be between Salt Lake City and Zion. Pack layers! It's not unusual for there to be a 20-degree difference.

Also, don't forget to factor in the time zone change if you're planning activities. While Salt Lake City is in Mountain Time, parts of your journey might cross into different time zones depending on the season and your exact route.

The drive might seem long, but trust me, it's worth every minute once you see those massive red cliffs at Zion. The park is absolutely breathtaking, and there's so much to do - from casual walks to intense hikes, and even rock climbing for the adventurous types.

Hope this helps with your planning! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments - I'm always happy to share more details about my experiences on this route.",1,1733628568.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm currently at the phase of the low FODMAP diet after 8 packs of Xifaxan400. 
It‚Äôs been a rough year.

I was at a Christmas party today and I had to say no to may traditional Polish dishes. I don‚Äôt feel hunger anymore after what I‚Äôve been through so it‚Äôs not a problem.
I had green tea, grilled chicken salad, and borsht (beetroot soup). I heard that the soup may not be safe since it‚Äôs rarely made fresh, and only fresh beetroot soup can be SIBO safe. I decided to check if I can eat a little of this soup, to prepare myself for the eventuality of having to sit in front of my Polish parents and denying to eat anything they serve during Christmas Eve, but maybe accepting traditional Polish soups. 

Of course the soup wasn‚Äôt a great idea and I‚Äôm in pain now. But I think I‚Äôve found something interesting. On my way to the Christmas dinner, I was not shaking from cold at all. I was totally fine. However, right after I left I immediately got the shakes, unstoppable shakes, I mean my spine hurt and I had to breathe slowly and try to focus on not dying of cold.
Green tea, chicken with salad, and some soup.

I‚Äôve also visited a therapist this week. I went there without eating anything and it was 1 PM. It was cold but I was not shaking when I was on my way there. I had only water that day, and some green tea in the lobby. And I still started shaking during therapy and even more so when I left the clinic! Am I getting crazy (I am from SIBO), or it is not malnutrition that‚Äôs causing this vulnerability to cold in some of us; but rather, even a little tea, coffee or unsafe foods? Meaning - SIBO itself is causing this somehow and only a perfect low FODMAP diet can stop vulnerability to cold? Apparently, on a good day I can take a walk in the snow no problem; but if I feel other symptoms (due to food or drinks) I will certainly start shaking immediately after going outside.

I like coffee, I drink it all the time. Usually black, sometimes decaf. So I do get the appeal of adding coffee to the brownies, it tastes good *to an extent*. A tablespoon is a lot of coffee, and it's an extremely powerful taste. I find that in most recipes, I need to reduce the amount of coffee by at least half to find a good balance.

Hi! I‚Äôm in Columbus Ohio and I‚Äôm looking for cool women to be friends with! I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm ace for a few years now.

About me: I‚Äôm 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I‚Äôm into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I‚Äôm 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I‚Äôm looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with.

1h99kmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1h99kmu/awakening/,Awakening,"It's been said that every human comes out of hibernation differently. Some wake up as if they just had the best night's sleep of their lives, stretching and yawning and coming to consciousness gently, slowly.  Others wake as if they were coming to after a night of partying; roughly, all at once, with a booming headache and fuzzy memories of the night before.

Alia woke screaming.

She sat up screaming, panicked, not knowing where she was, screams echoing in the cavernous room. Her head flailing around looking for something, *anything* familiar. She was on a hospital bed in a single spotlight, making the rest of the are seem like it didn't exist; the world was only her and her panic. She took great heaving gulps of air, trying not to hyperventilate. Easy. Slow down. You're all right.

The lights were dim around her, and through the darkness she could see that there were row after row after row of beds just like the one she was on, *hundreds* of beds all made with clean linens, waiting for people who weren't there. There was a little table next to her bed. and on it was a data pad and a cup of coffee in a delicate white mug on a little saucer.

The mug and saucer rattled gently with the low, subtle rumbling vibration that Alia noticed only now that her breathing was under control. As she leaned over to look at the cup, she saw that pad had a message: *Read me please, Alia.* Whoever it was knew her name at least. She had a flood of relief that with that realization she knew her name too.

She picked up the cup and took a sip of the coffee - it was hot, sweet, and black, - just the way she preferred it  - and opened the pad. As the screen lit, it was already on a message:

*Alia,* 

*I'm sorry to wake you like this. Something important has come up, and I can't make a Command Decision without you. After you finish your coffee and get dressed, please take the waiting cart to the command deck, I'll explain more when you get there.*

Best,   
*Greylo*ck

The *ship* woke her early and is asking for her to come up to the command deck? Something must be wrong. Right. That's right. She's co-captain of the ship *with* the ship. Her brain flicked a memory of the first time she was told she would be co-captain with an AI. The odd feelings she felt. 

As she swung her legs off the bed to get down, she saw the clothes neatly folded next to the little electric cart.  Quickly getting dressed, she grabbed the coffee and pad, and got into the cart. As she sat down it gently started off, preprogramed with its destination. As she rode, she looked around.

*Mt Greylock* was a colony ship.  Fifty thousand souls, all in deep, long term hibernation were aboard, all (hopefully) still asleep, awaiting for them to arrive at their new planet to begin the hard, rewarding process of setting up a new home for Humanity.  This isn't the first time we've done this.  Humanity has sent out at least a dozen colony ships, towards stars that their ultra long range telescope arrays said *might* hold a habitable planet to extend our reach and make sure humanity can grow and thrive.

It was quite a long ride actually. The colony ship was a cylinder kilometers long, with the hibernation cabinets arranged like bunches of fruits along it's spine, the furthest from any stray interstellar radiation. The ship was shielded of course, but the journey was long, and anything that could be done to improve the chances of survival was done. That included keeping all the colony supplies; machinery, tools, building material, other raw materials and durable goods at the 'bottom' to act as further shielding. While under thrust, down was along the axis of Grelock, so she rode on a path that gently spiraled 'up' the ship, towards the back. They were braking, so they went butt first through space. 

Alia passed cabins and residential spaces for the future residents, cafeterias and canteens, exercise rooms, schools, everything the colonists would need to survive and thrive aboard Greylock until the colony was established enough to head down. Once that was done, Greylock would be moved to the L2 point of the planet and become the welcoming station for any future visitors and colonists. Eventually, the little cart came to a gentle stop in front of the door of the command deck.  She got out and walked through the door which opened as she approached it.

The command deck was also empty and dark except for the command chair in the middle, which had a single spotlight on it. 

Her chair.

As the human commander of Mt Greylock, getting everyone to their new planet and starting a new colony was their responsibility, together with the AI that *was* the ship, who was also called Mt Grelock.

Alia sat, flinching slightly in the cold chair, and said out loud ""Okay Greylock.  I'm here, I've had my coffee. What is it? I woke up screaming again, not knowing where I was, which implies that you rushed my warming, and if the rumbling and rattling is any indication. Something must be wrong.""

""Well, you see.."" Greylock had a smooth alto voice and had chosen female pronouns.  AIs didn't *really* have gender, but some choose to present with either masc or femme traits. ""You see... I don't know.""

""What do you mean, *you don't know*?"" Alia said, incredulous. 

""We've received a message""

""From Earth? That's not that unusual. They probably have more useless updates to the colony package for us."" Three times so far, Earth had used extremely high powered lasers to beam an update message to Greylock. Three times it contained 'ideas' that someone had to 'improve their chances' at a successful colony. Three times they had been useless. Grelock kept them just in case, but she had decided they weren't worth installing.

""Er, no...  Not from Earth"" Greylock said quietly.

Alia's blood ran cold. That wasn't supposed to happen. It was made crystal clear that they were going to be alone until the second round of colonists showed up. They were about twenty five years behind them. ""From...another colony?"" she asked, carefully. What else could it be?

""Sort of?"" Greylock was audibly stressed. ""Look.  Why don't you just play it, I'll put it on the main screen. That might help.""

Ahead, the main screen lit up stark white. Alia squinted against the bright until her eyes adjusted, and then the video started.  It was a human male, wearing a uniform she didn't recognize.

She pressed the play button. 

""Uh, Hello! My name is James Tennigan, current administrator for the human colony Halcyon. We see that you have begun braking towards us. Two Nullships that were in-system and the main station are in agreement that you are most likely a Human colony ship.""

James looked down at a pad, and Alia saw him trying to read ahead. He continued, ""I wanted to give you a few facts before you came in-system.  One: Halcyon is about 400 years old. After the Nulldrive was developed we were able to spread across our section of the galaxy superluminally. We've been expanding and exploring that whole time.

Alia paused the video. ""The *what?*"" she said

""I don't know either,"" Greylock said. ""It sounds like humans developed some kind of FTL after we left and have gotten a head start on us.  Sounds like we were missing out on a lot.""

Alia restarted the video. ""We can welcome all of you with open arms, but you won't be coming to a raw planet, ready to be shaped into a colony of your own making. And Two...We need your help.  *You*, specifically, Alia Maplebrook, Co Captain of Mt Greylock."" He looked down at his pad again. ""Well, if you're the one viewing this message. Archives indicted that you were the co-captain of Mt Grelock and we're pretty sure that's the ship braking towards us now as all of the other colony ships were accounted for centuries ago. We'll send another message when you're closer, but we wanted to get this message beamed as soon as possible to give Mt Greylock time to wake you and prepare.""

The message ended. Wordlessly, Alia played it again. 

Alia looked up at the ceiling, then looked out into the empty command deck.

""*Fuck Me.*"" was all she said.",45,1733627738.0,HFY,12,0.98,False

My original trip was to arrive in PP, go to Kampung Thom, then on to Siem Reap, Battambang then last go to Kampot. Now we are thinking of first visiting Mondoukiri first.

If we don't include Mondoukiri I feel that we would most likely be ok relying on Grab (although I am not sure about Kampung Thom as my fiance's village is very small and we may have issues getting from the Province into the village.) 

But I have no idea if we can book a grab for a 7 hour trip from PP to Mondoukiri and then from Mondoukiri to Kampung Thom.

My fianc√© has suggested a bus however we have a very specific time table to meet and I want to stop along the way.

Last time I was there I met a very nice driver who I have stayed in touch with. He said that for the 9 days of him driving us around Cambodia it would cost $600 and I believe that would also include the trip to and leaving Mondoukiri.

I think that is most likely a good price for what he is offering however it is a lot of money and it is going to be an expensive trip overall so I'd like to save money where I can.

Any advice would be great. Should we add Mondoukiri to the trip? I do want to visit the Palin Coffee plantation and waterfalls (don't have time for the elephant sanctuary), but it will take time away from the other stops and may cause transportation issues.

Am I ok with just relying on Grab even for the very long portions of the trip? Would it be too expensive? Should I book the private driver?

While I would ideally like to upgrade my grinder at some point for espresso, I am hoping to use my Virtuoso+ for both espresso and French press for the time being. Unfortunately, I don't have thousands to spend on espresso makers and grinders.

That being said, I am extremely new to the espresso world and have seen people recommend performing the stepless mod from Baritza to effectively use the Virtuoso+ for espresso. I'm not super familiar with much of the terminology being used on many of these posts and can't find info about them, but I do see many guides on performing the stepless mod. Anyway, I'm concerned that, if I make the stepless mod to my Virtuoso+, I won't be able to continue using it for French press coffee, or that I might have to reverse the mod if I plan to use it for French press, which obviously has a larger grind size. Will I have to undo the stepless mod every time I want to use the Virtuoso+ for French press, or should this not negatively impact its ability to grind coffee beans at an ideal grind size for French press? Will it be extremely problematic to use the same machine to alternate between French press and espresso grind sizes, or is there some way I should clean/flush out the machine in between uses to achieve this successfully?

Please don't come for me, I understand my setup is not ideal and I am not as educated on this subject as I'd like to be in the future, but I am trying my best and am also not made of money. üò≠",1,1733627243.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Hey there, curious or lonely lurker of Reddit. It's me, your girl who's tired of today's dating culture and wanting a serious and healthy relationship. We don't even have to rush it. Good things take time, and I'm more than willing to establish a meaningful, human connection over time. I don't play mind games, and I certainly don't ghost (unless you seriously give off serial killer vibes).

**Here's a little about me:**

* Physically, five-foot-three and fluffy. I'm working towards shedding a few extra pounds. I'm not a thin or a fit girl but am making positive steps to get to a weight where I feel good about myself. You can be there for my glow-up!
* East Asian and proud of my roots. I'm very traditional and family-oriented. Maybe it's a deal-breaker for you, but one of my dreams is to become a housewife who packs her husband lunch everyday. I have a loving relationship with my family and am very in touch with my culture.
* A nerd at heart. I enjoy gaming, tabletop gaming, anime, TCG, DnD, comics, and building Gunpla. Some of my hobbies include going to anime conventions and collecting Pokemon cards.
* Very artistically inclined. I love writing and drawing. I went to art college and spend everyday writing. Currently, I'm working towards starting up my own art shop and selling full-time.
* This may be a deal-breaker as well, but I'm currently not at a financially stable time in my life right now. I don't have a 9-to-5 career as I'm transitioning into making something I'm passionate about into a possible career for myself. I work part-time as a waitress and live with my family.
* My love languages are: acts of service and physical touch. I like to receive: acts of service, words of affirmation, and physical touch.
* Don't have guy friends you'd have to worry about (lol). I have three best girl friends I'd die and eat pickles for (I hate pickles).
* I don't have any social media besides two. I quit all other unnecessary social media 8 years ago and never looked back. I'm so much happier without them. 
* INFP, a Hufflepuff.
* My other hobbies include: gardening, cooking, all things coffee, grocery shopping (lol), watching movies, visiting gardens and museums, and playing volleyball.

**Here's what I'm looking for:**

* First and foremost, a kind person. Not the kind of person who'll flip their ""kind"" side when it's convenient, or use it as a fa√ßade. Someone who's kindhearted to their core and is chivalrous.
* Doesn't smoke, drink excessively, vape, or do drugs.
* Is emotionally secure and independent. Knows how to communicate and be a decent human being.
* Ambitious if not career-driven. I don't care for salaries or impressive careers but please have a passion for something that will better your life.
* Any and all races are fine with me.
* Local to me (SoCal) and willing to meet preferably soon. I'm not confident I'd be able to do long distance as I'm sort of terrible with keeping up with too many texts and phone calls...
* You like driving. I was born to be a passenger princess...
* A funny dude who can roast me (lightly) and be roasted in return (heavily). A sense of humor withstands time. If we're not joking around and yearning for the urn together, what are we even doing?
* Someone to eat the pickles off my burgers.
* **Bonus points if you're a nerd like me!**

Right off I had issues with steaming milk. No setting changes seemed to work. It started hitting the high temp cutoff early and I'd watch the temp start dropping rapidly. It was frustrating, but I didn't have time to deal with it and I've only had time to make coffee on my days off so I've been hand grinding and using my Chemex. 

Well the other night I cleaned my machine up and was cycling water through the system when I noticed an electrical burn smell. Pulled the top and saw the connectors to the steam thermostat were melted. Thinking back, I did have a hell of a time pulling those off. They were insanely more difficult than any of the other connectors. I must have damaged something, creating a short which eventually got bad enough to melt the plastic. 

So - where might one find the correct thermostat to replace this one.... and the correct spare connectors with the high temperature plastic bits?

1h992wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1h992wq/do_breville_espresso_machines_go_on_sale/,Do Breville espresso machines go on sale?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I get this question all the time - especially from people looking to upgrade their home coffee game. So, let me share what I know about Breville espresso machine sales and how to get the best deals.

From my experience, Breville espresso machines do go on sale, but not as frequently as other brands. The best times to catch these deals are during major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day. I've noticed that discounts typically range from 15% to 25% off, which can save you hundreds of dollars on high-end models.

Last year, I managed to snag a Breville Barista Express at a sweet 20% discount during the holiday season. The key is being patient and keeping an eye on prices throughout the year. Speaking of which, I've found this awesome deal page that tracks Breville machine prices: https://athometouch.com/breville

Here's what I've learned about Breville sales patterns:

1. Seasonal Sales: Holiday seasons (November-December) usually offer the deepest discounts
2. Model Releases: When new models come out, older versions often get marked down
3. Bundle Deals: Sometimes retailers offer package deals with accessories
4. Flash Sales: Random short-term discounts pop up occasionally

Pro tip: Don't just wait for sales - consider certified refurbished machines too. They're thoroughly tested, come with warranties, and can save you 30-40% off retail prices.

Quick price comparison I did last month:
- Regular price: $699.95
- Black Friday sale: $559.96
- Prime Day deal: $579.95
- Random flash sale: $629.95

One thing I've noticed is that authorized retailers like Amazon, Williams-Sonoma, and Bed Bath & Beyond tend to price-match each other during major sales events. So if one store runs out of stock, you've got backup options.

Another money-saving hack I use is signing up for retailer newsletters. They often send exclusive discount codes and early sale notifications. I've scored some pretty sweet deals this way.

But here's the thing - if you find a good deal, don't wait too long. Breville machines sell out fast during sales, and I've seen plenty of disappointed coffee lovers miss out because they hesitated.

Just remember that even at full price, these machines are solid investments. Mine has saved me thousands on coffee shop visits over the years. The build quality is excellent, and they last for ages with proper maintenance.

Hope this helps you score a great deal on your dream espresso machine! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers.",1,1733626094.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I recently discovered some amazing ways to experience the Big Apple that go beyond the usual tourist checklist. After living here for years and hosting countless friends, I've put together my top 5 recommendations that'll give you a fresh perspective on New York City.

1. See NYC from Above (My Absolute Favorite!)
I recently took the Big Apple Helicopter Tour, and honestly, it changed how I see the city. There's something magical about soaring above Manhattan and seeing landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building from a bird's eye view. The 20-minute flight gives you views that even locals rarely get to experience. I booked mine through this link (https://athometouch.com/BigAppleTour) and got a great deal. Pro tip: Book early morning flights for the best lighting and smaller crowds!

2. Food Tours in Hidden Neighborhoods
Skip the tourist traps and dive into local food scenes in places like Jackson Heights or Sunset Park. These neighborhoods offer authentic experiences that most visitors miss. I recently joined a walking food tour in Flushing and discovered amazing dim sum spots I never knew existed.

3. Street Art Walking Tours
The city's street art scene is incredible, especially in Bushwick and Williamsburg. These areas are like outdoor museums that change constantly. Plus, you'll find great coffee shops and vintage stores along the way.

4. Sunset Sail Around Manhattan
There's something special about seeing the city lights come alive from the water. Several companies offer sunset cruises, but I recommend the smaller sailboats for a more intimate experience.

5. Hidden Speakeasy Adventure
NYC's speakeasy scene is alive and well. Places like Please Don't Tell (accessed through a phone booth!) offer unique cocktail experiences that feel straight out of the 1920s.

But honestly, if you can only do one thing from this list, I'd highly recommend the helicopter tour. Getting that aerial view of NYC is absolutely unforgettable - seeing Central Park sprawled out below you, flying past the Chrysler Building, and spotting Yankee Stadium in the distance... it's surreal. 

I paid $279 for my tour (totally worth it), and you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change. Based on the 4.5/5 stars from hundreds of other visitors, I'm clearly not alone in thinking this is a must-do NYC experience.

If you're interested, I'd suggest booking through this link: https://athometouch.com/BigAppleTour - they often have good deals and the booking process is super smooth.

She was everything I was looking for‚Äîwitty, compassionate, and we bonded instantly over our shared love of animals. She even told me about her golden retriever, Max, who sounded like an absolute sweetheart. I‚Äôm a huge dog person, so her mentioning Max was honestly a bonus point in her favor.

After a couple of great conversations, we decided to meet up for a park date with Max. The idea of walking dogs together felt low-pressure and fun, so I brought my lab mix, Bella, along too. When I met Max, it was clear Sarah adored him, and he was just as amazing as she described. The date went great‚Äîour dogs got along, and so did we. We even ended up sitting at a coffee shop afterward, talking for hours.

Fast forward a few weeks, and things were going really well between us. But then, during dinner one night, Sarah casually dropped something that threw me off. She mentioned she‚Äôd need to swing by her ex‚Äôs place that weekend to drop Max off because they shared custody of him. I must‚Äôve looked surprised because she quickly added, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs nothing weird! We broke up over a year ago, but we both love Max too much to let one of us keep him. So we take turns.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond at first. I told her I admired how committed she was to Max, but I also couldn‚Äôt shake this weird feeling. She noticed my hesitation and said, ‚ÄúI get why it might seem odd, but I promise there‚Äôs nothing between us anymore. We‚Äôre basically co-parents‚Äîfor a dog.‚Äù

The thing is, I‚Äôve been burned before by someone who wasn‚Äôt over their ex, and this situation brought up all those old insecurities. I started wondering if I was stepping into a dynamic where I‚Äôd always feel like a third wheel. What happens if her ex wants to rekindle things? Or if they start hanging out more because of Max?

A couple of days later, I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure I could do this. She looked hurt but said she understood. She also insisted that her relationship with her ex was strictly platonic and that Max was the only thing keeping them connected. But part of me felt like I‚Äôd be competing with that connection, even if there was no romantic relationship anymore.

Now I‚Äôm left wondering if I overreacted. My friends are split‚Äîsome say I should‚Äôve given it more time, while others think it‚Äôs a red flag to be so tied to an ex, even because of a dog.

1h98yzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h98yzb/i_love_my_wife_but_i_had_sex_with_her_sister/,"I love my wife, but I had sex with her sister.","Before passing judgement, read my entire story.

I (35m) was married to Lena (34f) for a decade. And I wouldn‚Äôt have believed you if you‚Äôd told me, all of those years ago, that I would one day sleep with her older sister, Riley (40f) ‚Äî that I would one day *marry* Riley.

We‚Äôll get to that.

The nightmare began with the death of Lena, who I will forever call my *true* wife, from pancreatic cancer.

And the second chapter of grief began on an evening, two weekends ago, when I asked, ‚ÄúWas she telling the truth?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù Riley replied.

From the front room of Macy Manor, I stood and watched the snowfall beyond the window; watched white bury black. Meanwhile, Riley was sitting in her father‚Äôs old armchair, by the crackling fireplace, and nursing a tumbler of brandy in loose fingers. Clearly, like me, reflecting on everything.

When Mr and Mrs Macy died in 2005, Riley inherited that lavish Edwardian house and became Lena‚Äôs guardian. It was shortly after this that Lena, my childhood friend, finally admitted the truth.

‚ÄúLena told me that the two of you could see the spirits of your parents,‚Äù I finally answered.

Riley stared vacantly at the opposite side of the room, and I followed her gaze. My eyes fell upon an empty armchair with a still shadow sitting upon it; strangely, the fireplace‚Äôs animated flames cast dancing patches of darkness across every other surface in the room.

My late wife‚Äôs sister finally whispered, ‚ÄúA century ago, Ernest Macy built this home upon a dark hole in the ground. In his diary, he forbade descendents from ever entering the hole, for it took a terrible toll on him. A toll that, nevertheless, gifted the Macy family with the ability to see the spectres of their lost loved ones.

‚ÄúOf course, let‚Äôs be honest, that gift will die with me. I‚Äôm the last of the Macy lineage, and I won‚Äôt be having any children.‚Äù

‚ÄúLena never mentioned a magical hole in the dirt,‚Äù I said, trying to stifle a chuckle.

‚ÄúBecause you always wear that shit-eating grin on your face, Artie,‚Äù Riley replied, smirking as she tapping the heel of her foot against a dusty, leatherbound book on the coffee table. ‚ÄúThis is Ernest‚Äôs diary.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think that book‚Äôs been sitting there since I first visited your home,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôve always respected your family‚Äôs beliefs, Riley, but I‚Äôve never seen any evidence of ghosts in this house.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre not a Macy,‚Äù she replied.

I nodded, pressing my palm against the outline of Lena‚Äôs engagement band in my pocket. ‚ÄúNo, not quite.‚Äù

Riley continued looking at that unsettling armchair, empty save for the heavy shade upon it, then she coldly said, ‚ÄúLena wants to show you, the best way she *can* show a non-Macy, that she‚Äôs here.‚Äù

Without even thinking, I immediately replied, ‚ÄúI want to believe. Lena, if you hear‚Äî‚Äù

The empty armchair interrupted me.

It was flung upwards and flipped upside down; hurled against the white ceiling to which its base clung tightly. And I yelled, of course, as any rational person would. Veins protruded beneath my skin as I tightly clenched every muscle in my body. Only a second later, the paranormal chair fell and landed, kicking up a mound of dust, in its overturned state on the floor.

After an unknown length of silence, I croaked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve felt her in this house. Ever since she passed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dead never really leave this place,‚Äù said Riley, ‚Äúso grief is different for a Macy. Even for you, Artie. You‚Äôre as good as family.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I actually *had* been a Macy?‚Äù I asked, eyes welling. ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôd married Lena and taken her name?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúMy mother married into the family, and she saw the faces of the dead.‚Äù

Then, without leaving an appropriate pause, I asked something horrific. ‚ÄúWe should marry. You and me. That way, I‚Äôll be able to see her too.‚Äù

I expected ridicule, or a scream of protest, once Riley realised I was telling the truth. But she seemed to immediately detect the sincerity of my tone. Perhaps the thought had already crossed her mind.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not go there, Artie,‚Äù she warned.

I turned to the overturned armchair, addressing the shadow I knew to be cast by my wife. ‚ÄúLena, it would only be a marriage on paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not refusing on her behalf,‚Äù Riley explained. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôd need to do more than legally change your surname. We would need to *consummate* the marriage, Artie.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù came my meek voice, followed by the flipped armchair‚Äôs disapproving creak.

‚Äú*Oh*,‚Äù Riley repeated, laughing. ‚ÄúAs in: oh, if only you could see the face your wife is pulling.‚Äù

I fell quiet after that, and my sister-in-law went up to bed a few minutes later. I, on the other hand, spent the rest of the night skim-reading Ernest‚Äôs diary. Lena was reading alongside me. And I felt her excitement, which rivalled mine, as we read Ernest‚Äôs section titled: *The Plea of Two*.

A gust of wind rucked a chunk of the old, brown page ‚Äî rucked the passage which read:

*To return a loved one‚Äôs physical form, the ritual must be performed by two living members of the Macy family.*

However, I felt it in the air. Felt that my wife wanted a second chance at life. And, had she not, I wouldn‚Äôt have pushed it. Wouldn‚Äôt have woken Riley and explained the situation at four in the morning. She quarrelled with Lena about the ethics of it all; not so much marrying and sleeping with her late sister‚Äôs husband, but resurrecting the dead.

Lena and I should have listened.

But we didn‚Äôt, and Riley was, after only ten minutes of arguing, corrupted by that desire to end our collective grief. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt try, I‚Äôd always regret it‚Ä¶‚Äù

My jaw hung. ‚ÄúDoes that mean‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúVegas is the quick option,‚Äù my sister-in-law interrupted. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll consummate the marriage *briefly*. No lights. No talking.‚Äù

I nodded, sobbing joyously as I eyeballed the shadowy corner of the bedroom in which I knew Lena lurked.

And a few days later, once Riley and I had successfully obtained ESTAs, we flew out to Vegas. Signed the deed. *Did* the deed. That greatest shame of our lives unfolded in an unlit hotel room, for a little less than ten seconds, and was followed by a long, silent flight back to England.

A week after we‚Äôd hatched our plan, we returned to Macy Manor. Drove along the driveway on a night darker, and snowier, than the formidable one on which we‚Äôd made this unnatural decision.

All of that discomfort and regret washed away upon stepping across the threshold, however, because there she stood. Blonde-haired in her unmistakable blue dungaree. She was a spectral light, burning blindingly into my retinas, that watched me from the main staircase.

We ran towards one another, sobbing and professing our love as we did, and those tears only flowed more heavily as our arms ran through one another ‚Äî as we realised, of course, that we could not touch. Of course, I reminded myself of the only reason that Riley and I had done what we did.

We were going to bring Lena back.

The ghost of my wife stood in the front room‚Äôs doorway as Riley and I, holding hands, followed the instructions detailed within Ernest‚Äôs diary. Two Macy members reciting The Plea of Two ‚Äî begging for a dark thing, which we did not understand, to return Lena to us in physical form. Begging that dark hole in the basement, which we were forbidden from even looking upon. I wondered whether every single Macy family member had, in fact, obeyed Ernest‚Äôs strict rule. Surely, in the space of a century, *somebody* else had been down there.

I was wrenched from my thoughts by the bulky diary slamming shut; a force which rattled the very house itself. In response, Riley and I gasped, turned to the doorway, then gasped again.

Lena‚Äôs phantom form wasn‚Äôt there.

Then came, from the entryway, a creak. Without any sense of self-preservation, I tiptoed towards the lobby, peered around the doorframe, and whimpered soulfully as I saw the basement door standing ajar. A door I had never, in the twenty years of visiting Macy Manor, seen open.

And through the slight gap, in the darkness of the basement staircase, there glowed a rather timid set of blue eyes that I would‚Äôve recognised anywhere.

They weren‚Äôt translucent this time.

‚Äú*LENA!*‚Äù I wailed, feeling twice as euphoric as I had during our first reunion.

‚ÄúArtie‚Ä¶‚Äù Riley began as I rushed forwards; hints of uncertainty and fear in her raspy voice.

I barely noticed. Barely noticed anything other than the eyes of the woman I loved. I reached for the door handle with eager blindness; didn‚Äôt even find it odd that Lena‚Äôs blue eyes disappeared into the darkness as I threw the door open.

I followed. Bounced down wooden steps in that black, forbidden part of the manor. Wilfully ignored the stench of a smell that did not belong in the earthly realm ‚Äî Riley was right; grief is different for a Macy.

Moonlight, invited inside by an empty slit of a window frame, revealed a black hole in the very floor of the basement. An ancient wooden door lay open, suggesting that Ernest had kept the supernatural opening under lock and key. But I cared for none of that.

The moonlight, most importantly, revealed Lena.

All in that place was a dream ‚Äî from my unthinking head to my light toes; for I was floating, perhaps literally, towards the physical embodiment of my wife. It was only as our lips met that the vision began to sour. There came a feeling that had been trying to bubble to the surface from the moment Riley and I had completed The Plea of Two.

*Terror.*

Warmth filled my mouth; a black warmth violating my senses, having circumvented my defences. And when I opened my eyes, I screamed ‚Äî a scream muffled by her mouth. I looked into eyes no longer brown, but *black*. A ravenous black that swallowed the irises, then the entirety of the eyes.

Her muscular fingers dug deeply into my upper arms, preventing my escape, and then she began to step backwards; began to reverse into the hole, taking me with her.

It had all been a lie. The Plea of Two was never going to bring anybody back. It brought something else out of the hole. And that made me fear what other lies the blackness had told Ernest Macy; what terrifying rituals he might‚Äôve performed.

There came footsteps down the stairs, and I saw Riley in the glossy reflection of the demon‚Äôs black eyes. Saw her come so close to reaching me, before being tossed, like a ragdoll, against the far wall of the basement.

The toes of my trainers start to slip into the unholy darkness, and I felt a chill beyond coldness; something that no human knows how to feel. I closed my eyes and prayed that I would meet an end ‚Äî I had a feeling that surviving in that black place would be the worst nightmare imaginable.

Whilst blind to the world, however, I was startled to feel that creature‚Äôs lips and nails release my frail body, letting me fall backwards onto the basement floor. And I opened my eyes to see something horridly beautiful.

White hands, stemming from a form that brightly illuminated the dingy basement, were knotted within the false Lena‚Äôs hair ‚Äî and those hands began to push the deceitful creature‚Äôs head downwards, casting the creature back to the black world.

I sobbed as the ghost of the true Lena, steel shackles binding her wrists and neck to the black realm below, revealed her form behind the creature she was submerging into the darkness. Into the nightmarish world which was claiming Lena‚Äôs bound, ghostly form too.

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she mouthed tearfully.

I reached out helplessly as Lena‚Äôs teary eyes slipped into the opening, following the thing she had vanquished.

Then the wooden trapdoor swung closed.

For days, I have felt a deeper grief than before. A grief worsened by my inability to move forwards; Riley had been right all along.

I don‚Äôt eat. I don‚Äôt sleep. I sit in her front room, eyeing the many dead faces of the Macy family. But there is only one I hope to see, even if that hope rots my insides.

If she doesn‚Äôt walk through that door soon, I will find a way to bring her [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).",43,1733625717.0,nosleep,2,0.84,False

I was thinking about very ""mundane"" ingredients (ie: various household seasonings, things we usually throw away/into compost etc)

And, now this made sense to me, but would it be inaccurate for someone to consider the common uses an ingredient has and how that could translate into a spell ingredient?

For instance, I hyperfocused on egg shells. (because I have a ton I need to crush lol)

And I know traditionally they are often used as a protection ingredient and that makes sense as that's literally what they do, protect the growing chicken inside.

But I decided to look at common uses for egg shells and found: that they make great fertilizer, can be fed back to hens to replenish their calcium to continue laying healthy eggs, when ground into a fine powder they can balance the bitterness of coffee, be used to make a cleaning paste, homemade sidewalk chalk... and just loads of other stuff.

I also considered what the shell is made up of (a good source of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, and potassium!) 

I know that our intention behind the spells we do is a big part of spell work. 

So if we put the intent in,  would it make sense to use crushed egg shell (in combination with other ingredients) for say a spell to restore balance (because it's used to replenish a chickens calcium)  or maybe a spell to ease a broken heart (because potassium is necessary for healthy heart function)

I'm still pretty new to everything and I realize everyone's practice is different. I'm just curious if this makes sense as far as applying magical properties to ingredients or finding more ways to use them.

i didn‚Äôt know who to celebrate with so i‚Äôm putting it here 

what i‚Äôve done:
- tried to be more social with my friends: i went out for coffee today with someone, and said yes to playing video games with a friend, saving me some of that lonely depressing evening thought spiralling
- started reading: a lot of my current issues revolve around trauma and my emotions towards them so i‚Äôve started reading ‚Äúadult children of emotionally immature parents‚Äù
- drank a WHOLE LOT of dr pepper


what ive noticed:
- i have much less of an appetite, and what i do want tends to be sugary, when i do get really hungry i can‚Äôt stomach as much as usual
- less acid reflux
- i personally feel like my facial swelling is minorly different but i haven‚Äôt asked anyone if they‚Äôve noticed it 
- getting to sleep is WAY harder but im not waking up as often during the night 
- i want to draw a lot more, and actually have spent some time doing it and not just saying ‚Äúi want to‚Äù


i‚Äôm hoping week 2 i‚Äôll keep noticing things that are good and not just stuff that‚Äôs difficult to cope with without alcohol- the cravings definitely have amped up so i have to keep writing down and reminding myself that the little comfort i get from it doesn‚Äôt outweigh the long list of things that go wrong

# Reality: Cash & checks are still needed.

There are still real needs for cash and checks. If someone wants to tip with cash, pay for a soda at the vending machine and the card swipe doesn't work, pay the neighborhood youngster for mowing your lawn, kids need lunch money, school field trip payment, pay your kiddos an allowance, pay back a friend for dinner the other night and they want cash, Zelle, CashApp, etc. And this is just stuff I needed to do in the last week with cash or check, if I spent more time I could think of a lot more.

# Reality: Financial discipline is still required.

Being a net producer is the goal. We still gotta be more of a maker than a taker. Low-time preference is still key. Some people might mistakenly think, ""Hey, I can spend more now because Bitcoin is gonna pay for my jewelry and clothes and vacays and new cars and frufru coffees and that new house I wanted."" Especially if someone is a big spender and they let their credit cards just rack up and up and up. ... Nah, we still gotta keep track of spending and stick to the budget so that we can stack more sats.

# Realistic Theory: Mostly Bitcoin is do-able.

I think it is realistic for most Bitcoiners to go 80-95% into Bitcoin, and it wouldn't be a problem, depending on their financial circumstances.

Self-custody Bitcoin is also a huge priority for us Bitcoiners, so optimizing the ratio of cold storage to hot Strike wallet will also be something to keep an eye on.",3,1733624950.0,strikebtc,6,0.81,False

the more I get to understand and accept everything about her. The fact that she loves color blue, black, simple shirts, watches, coffee, her hair style every single day hahaha.

Okay, this is a lot. I'm going to try my best to explain this situation, but I can fill in gaps where needed after. so, i met this guy on a dating app. we talked here and there for a few days before meeting, when we first matched he did tell me that he would only be in town for a few days. we eventually decided to meet for coffee the day before he was leaving. we met and instantly clicked. it was quite puzzling to me just how similar we were and how seemingly perfect our chemistry was. the date was cute, we even slow danced in the middle of the coffee shop together (i asked him lol). the date went so well that i felt comfortable inviting him back to my house a little while later (not for anything but talking!) when he came he brought a bottle of wine that we drank while we talked all night. I can't tell you just how comfortable and calm i felt around him, and he would say that the feeling was mutual. we talked here and there about the fact that he had to leave the next day, in small comments. we talked about possibly seeing each other again when he's back in town for christmas and staying in touch until then. we kissed and cuddled, which was also the most perfect. he spent the night with me and left for home the next morning (8 hours away). I quickly realized that i was very shocked at how genuine, kind, and confident he was.

i've found myself in a position as i feel i found a person that i would mesh very well with. we have similar tastes, have been through similar struggles, and the chemistry and interest seemed to be there.

a few days after he got home and we had texted here and there - he hadn't texted me back for a day, so i asked him if he was still interested in talking. he said while he felt comfortable and really enjoyed our time together, he doesn't feel like he could maintain a long distance relationship an won't be able to come home for christmas like he had originally thought. he feels quite bad about what happened he said as well. (no need for him to feel bad, i'll add)

i texted back saying i understand that, and that i myself may not be in the best place right now for something but that i was still interested in being friends if he was open to that. i got no response.

what does this mean?

would i be crazy to just tell him how i feel and not try to play it cool?

would i be crazy to wait a month or so and check in with him?

should i just leave the situation be as is and move on? 

i really felt a connection with this person, which is hard to come by for me. i have always struggled feeling like i deeply connect with anybody, and this is by far the deepest i have felt. i feel sad at the thought of letting that connection die off.

I also know that it can be very impractical for a new relationship to be a long distance relationship, and i understand his reasoning - but i cannot stop this feeling.

note - i would 100% be willing to travel to see him often, i love driving and travel, so this wouldn't be an issue so long we could find times that would work :)

any helpful words are much appreciated <3
also, i forgot to add this - i am 22 and he is 25! he also is in the military which im sure plays a part as well.

1h98ggg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1h98ggg/my_childhood_best_friend_is_gone/,My childhood best friend is gone.,"This is hard to type, but I need to do this because I‚Äôm so lost. 

I have known this girl since I was in third grade, she was my first and for the longest time my only friend in school. We were both severely bullied and outcasted from our peers, so we found comfort in one another. 

She became not only my best friend, but she was practically a sister to me. Her family honestly took me in and helped raise me when my father couldn‚Äôt. We would always hang out in school, I would go to her house after school nearly every day and I would stay there until my father could come get me. 

Nearly every weekend I was spending the night and having sleep overs with her. We laughed, cried, fought sometimes but made up, and we were absolute best friends. We planned a future where we would get married on the same day, grow up next to one another and our kids would be best friends too. 

But life had another plan. Nearly 5 years of friendship, we were forced apart thanks to my father and his wife making me leave schools and refusing to let me speak to any old friends I had. We lost contact for about 4 years, until I left to live with my mom and I was finally able to reach out again on Facebook. 

My mom drove me herself to go see my old best friend, and although we did cry and catch up, it sadly was never the same thanks to those years being forced apart. We kept in touch for a bit until we both agreed it was better to remain acquaintances rather than friends. I knew it broke her heart like it did mine, and it still hurts.. 

Yesterday, 12/6/2024, her mother called me on messenger to tell me she died. From cancer. And now my whole world is thrown through a loop. 

I have never lost someone before.. and I feel so wrong. We weren‚Äôt close as we once were, but I‚Äôm grieving so hard. I feel like I‚Äôm not grieving right or correctly if that makes sense.. I feel like I don‚Äôt have a right to grieve like her family does. I feel like I‚Äôm inconveniencing everyone else around me because I‚Äôm just useless right now. 

I barely held it together at work today and almost cried in front of customers. I just drank multiple coffees to get over it. I feel so.. lost. I see the happy Christmas lights and cheer, it was our favorite holiday, but now it feels.. empty. Lifeless. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. My fianc√© is doing his best to help, but I feel like I‚Äôm just messing it up. He knows what grief feels like, he‚Äôs sadly lost his mother and his great grandfather. But I feel like mine doesn‚Äôt compare to his, and that I just don‚Äôt need to.. 

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm sorry for inconveniencing anybody who reads this too. I‚Äôm just sorry. 

I miss you Hailey. You deserved the entire world. I will forever love you as my sister, and I‚Äôll see you later. Not soon, but later. ",1,1733624013.0,GriefSupport,0,0.99,False
