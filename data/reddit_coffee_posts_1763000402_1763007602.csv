1ovriuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/1ovriuv/blew_things_up_with_my_mom_today_feeling_pretty/,Blew things up with my mom today. Feeling pretty good about it.,"This is going to be a long story. I'm a ruminator so I'm writing this out to help get it out of my brain. I'm hoping this will be therapeutic. I'm sure this will be a familiar story to some of you, if you decide to read.

I grew up in an alcoholic home. I'm 27F and my dad was an alcoholic, he went into recovery when I was 12. As the story almost always goes, as the girl child, I internalized all of the family conflict and became the peace maker. Stabilizing the boat felt like my job, and I became a perfectionist to try to prevent any blow ups in the family. It eventually manifested into anxiety, depression, etc etc as a teenager. I was really struggling and felt like I was drowning, and it felt like nobody ever saw. My brother was an externalizer and responded to the stress of the home by blowing up at school, failing classes, and being disobedient. I fell quietly into the background, silently crying for help that nobody ever saw. 

Eventually I graduated high school and moved out after a blow up with my mom. Spent a few years trying to find myself and ended up in emotionally distant and controlling relationships because this shit is a cycle. Eventually I came back to the family seeking affirmation that I was a good daughter, hoping they'd feel pride in me.

In 2020 my mom fell down the qanon rabbit hole. She had slowly been sliding down into right wing rhetoric for a long time. What's funny is she raised me to be a feminist, pro choice, and strong. She Eventually lost the beliefs she taught me by falling into the cult. In late 2021, after constant barrages of text messages about the blood clotting vaccine, new world order, deep state, etc., I cut her out. This was the first time I had ever stood up to my family.

My dad, now recovered but not aware of the level of pain I was feeling about the relationships, tried multiple times to convince me to talk to her again. I let her back into my life late 2022. Its been rocky but slowly improving ever since. She's never understood a boundary (and boundary has become a bad word in the household since I've started using it), and I'd asked her probably 15 times at that point to stop talking politics around me. We disagree completely. She's always struggled but I've tried so hard to be patient as she stomps over my boundaries. 

Objectively, my life is amazing right now. I just hit 1 yr of sobriety from alcohol (surprise surprise) and got a life changing new job. Im a homeowner and my partner is incredibly loving. Life is good. It's my birthday next week. 

My mom and I got together for remembrance day yesterday. You all know how these interactions go. We're walking and I mention the nice weather. She responds with ""I'm so tired of people saying it's because of climate change. It's not a thing, you know? It's good the world is warming up here in Canada."" I change the topic subtly. 

We get to a Cafe. She brings up the ostrich farm incident (some canadian news story). I nod along and change the subject. We're waiting in line for our coffees and she is mumbling about how these young servers aren't rushing at all.

We watch the ceremony and she suggests going for lunch. I say sure. We sit down at the restaurant and she immediately goes into the teacher union strike. I sit silently grey rocking for 10 minutes as she's monologuing at me. They bring our food. I try changing the topic. She brings up the new federal budget and how the government is forcing us all to become Islamic. I hit my limit.

I'm sitting there thinking. God. I've been dodging shit all day. I spend so much effort trying to maneuver these conversation topics. When I can't maneuver I sit and just bear it. And this is miserable. And she is being so fucking rude right now. So I start debating her. If she is being rude why can't I. With every topic she brings up I try to explain how that headline is written to manipulate her. I explain how fox news and the algorithm is trying to feed off her anger. I explain that they've got us bickering to distract from the class war. She hates that I'm bringing this up and is slowly escalating. She tells me I'm being condescending. I ask how and she says ""because the Hamas protesters in Toronto have been doing this for 2 years."" I go ""what the fuck does that have to do with me being condescending?"" She goes ""the government is controlling us blah blah"" and I point outside the window and say ""really? Because life looks pretty good right now."" 

She leans across the table and says in the indoor-shout tone ""stick your head deeper in the fucking sand, MyName."" She even tilted her head in that annoying condescending way people do as they hit each syllable.

I react for the first time ever. I push my chair back and say ""were done."" I get up and go to the cash. She pays. She parked at my house though so we have to walk back together. I gather myself outside and when she steps outside, I try to talk about my feelings and how we communicate. It's a broken record. I say ""I feel mad that you brought up politics so many times today."" She goes ""the government is controlling us!"" I go ""why did you bring this up to me? What's the need underlying this? Are you seeking comfort or support?"" She goes ""the government is controlling us!"" I'm trying so hard to step out of how infuriating this interaction is to focus on us. How we relate to eachother. Any common ground. I'm trying to have a conversation about our relationship and she keeps spiraling back to me being a complicit leftie because the government is controlling her and she has every right to be distressed.

I hug her and tell her I love her and she leaves. I break down completely. I'm just so fucking exhausted. I spend three hours crying and spiraling and I can't stop the thoughts and sadness. I feel so fucking disrespected. It's been 7 years I've been asking her to stop talking politics to me and she refuses to respect that. 

We had mani pedis booked to celebrate my birthday this Friday. We had a super fancy supper booked to celebrate my new job. I cant stand the idea of seeing her, and I'm spending all day ranting to myself in my car, crying about the hurt, and going to AA meetings to stop myself from relapsing. Meanwhile I just know she's at home fighting with some troll on Twitter not thinking anything of this. 

Today, after so much conflict with myself, I decide to cancel my plans with her. I don't want to ruin my entire week by ruminating on how I'm going to have to set boundaries and weave through conversation with her at MY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. I text her and cancel and tell her im in a really bad mental health space. I instead decide to invite my best friends to supper because I want to be celebrated. This day is about ME. I am allowed to feel proud.

Anyways. She responded by gaslighting and minimizing everything that happened yesterday, in true immature narcissistic fashion. She said it wasn't a personal attack and she was just having a conversation. 

I'm bawling my eyes out and sitting in my car waiting desperately for my dad to come see me because I'm in so much distress. I tell her ""Its absolutely personal when you say ""stick your head deeper in the fucking sand, MyName. If you believe that was just a normal conversation, youre delusional."" My dad pulls up. 

He let's me yell and rant and explain everything that happened yesterday. I'm sobbing and swearing and he is silent just listening. He tells me the first priority is maintaining my sobriety, and secondly, that he gets it. He understands what I'm going through because he goes through the same thing with her. 

I mention how hard it is go weave through conversations avoiding her political jabs. He says he sees how often I do it, and that I'm actually pretty good at it. I tell him I'm so tired of this and feel the need to back away from her, and he agrees. He eventually starts trying to say, in the nicest way possible about his wife, that she natters to him about politics too and he responds by grey rocking as well. And that he suspects she sees what's happening and doubles down. And he says ""it feels like she is choosing to not respect me and my desire to not have that conversation.""

 In that moment, I felt so seen and validated. I cried. He truly understood the level of disrespect I've been feeling, and that it's an intentional choice on her end. Funny enough, my ruminating stops being so mean. I'm definitely still spiraling about all of this, and will be for a while. But damn. He gets it.

We hug it out, he congratulates me on my new job and tells me how proud he is of me. I hop in my car and check my messages and all Shea responded with is ""I'm sorry."" I go home and I'm just shocked that I literally called my mom delusional today. Eventually I start smiling about it. Like damn, I called her delusional. Damn, did I really do that? Did I really rock the boat? And holy shit, im not in trouble for it? And if anything, my dad agrees? 

I've been the black sheep of my family my entire life. I've been placating and fawning and bending over backwards to please everyone. And I called my mom delusional today. I'm not going to see her for the next few weeks. I'm going out for fancy supper this Friday with my best friends. My boyfriend cooked me supper today and made me a nest in the couch so we could watch my comfort cartoon together and he listened to me as I vented. I apologized for being a burden and he held my hand and kissed my forehead and told me I'm not a burden, he loves me, and he would help me any day I feel bad. 

I can't believe I called my mom delusional today. I don't even feel bad. I'm so fucking glad I did it. ",1,1763007347.0,QAnonCasualties,1,1.0,False

Living in San Pedro, I’ve learned that everything here is connected: the lake, the soil, the farmers, and the food that grows around us. The vegan community in Lake Atitlán has always understood that what we eat is part of how we live. It’s about respecting the land, the hands that grow our food, and the balance that keeps this place alive.

That’s where our [Coffee Fruit](https://ethicalfashionguatemala.com/from-bean-to-bar-experiencing-guatemalas-artisanal-cacao/) & Cacao Bliss Bites were born. The idea came to me while watching farmers bring in their coffee harvests. The bright red coffee cherries were bursting with color, and yet most of their fruit was thrown away once the beans were removed.

That outer layer, called cascara, is full of nutrients and natural sweetness. It’s one of the most antioxidant-rich foods in nature, filled with polyphenols that support the immune system, improve focus, and protect against inflammation.

When I started pairing that with raw Guatemalan cacao, I realized I had something special. Cacao has been part of Mayan life here for thousands of years. It’s rich in magnesium, iron, and theobromine, a gentle stimulant that helps with energy and mood.

For anyone living a vegan lifestyle, cacao is a great source of minerals that are often harder to get from plants alone. It supports heart health, muscle function, and a calm, clear mind.

Coconut ties it all together. It adds healthy fats known as MCTs that your body burns for fast, clean energy. It also provides fiber and a satisfying texture. The combination of cacao, coffee fruit, and coconut makes a perfect plant-based balance: antioxidants to protect your cells, minerals to strengthen your body, and natural fats and caffeine to fuel your day without a crash.",1,1763007176.0,EthicalFashionGuatema,0,1.0,False

she's very straightforward, calling out BS when she sees it, smart and witty. But her humor was so dark, I can't keep up sometimes hahaha but she's very funny, and caring to the people she trusts.

when the pandemic came, I had to stop going to work because of transportation issues, and health issues. so friend and I weren't seeing each other anymore, but we still talk every other day in messenger and maybe call each other sometimes (she was busy working from home and I was starting to help my family with our newly established business) she treasures friendship more than anyone I know, and that's probably why we were still talking to each other despite the no face to face interaction lol

I had a girlfriend at that time and unfortunately, we had to break up because of personal reasons. and the only friend that I can comfortably talk to was her, she was my constant buddy, like we were talking just abt everything, like threads and threads of messages haha it was crazy. she was doing her best to give me a really safe space and all (my heart feels heavy just by typing this) 

so when the pandemic restriction was lifted a little bit, we made plans to meet, have coffee and talk. she even went to my house and hung out with me. 

a year later, ex contacted me and wanted to fix things between us, and at the time I was hoping to get back with her. then we talked and talked, until we were sure that we were ready. 

and I know im the a-hole in this, but I was so consumed with getting back to my ex, that I never took the time to message my friend again. the last message she sent was abt Doja cat  shaving her head. memories hit me like a tidal wave when I went through my archives. the things we talked abt was so random, but heartfelt.  

I feel a deep regret for not reaching out to talking to her again. she was really a good friend to me, and I will never forget it.

1ovrd8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1ovrd8o/towards_better_loot/,Towards Better Loot,"Something that bothers me in scenarios is the payoff. ""Each player receives 500 eb."" Nothing wrong with it, per se. It's just...bland? There's nothing there that pulls me in to the world, nothing that sparks my interest or joy. It's just, ""Yay, that's half my rent payment. Whee...""

And I think that's a missed opportunity! Now, some folks will say that I'm missing the point of Cyberpunk, that the whole idea is you have to keep your nose to the grindstone lest you miss a rent payment and then BAM! You're on the Street, choom. But that tension doesn't really interest me as a source of drama, mostly because it's always being delayed, never resolved. Rent and lifestyle payments are a great money sink, don't get me wrong. They work so well I imported them to my D&D 5E game (and it pissed off my players). So I don't want to futz with rent or lifestyle, I just want to jazz this paradigm up a bit. I don't want a payment-based Sword of Damocles to be my players' primary memory of this world and this game. 

Interestingly, I think we've already got a great model for how to jazz this up - *One Red Night* from *Tales From The RED - Street Stories.* In that scenario, part of the payment (in addition to the 3K offered the Crew) is use of a really nice Pacifica apartment for a month, free. That is a *great* hook. Yes, money is nice, but when was the last time you slept on sheets that had a thread count in the four figures? 

That's the kind of thing I'm looking to leverage. Instead of just giving your players the payout for a job, give them the payout and something else. Examples include:

# Experiences

>The payout is 1,000 eb each, and of course my bevy of talented, attractive companions will ensure you have a wonderful night tonight. Yes, all of them are the proper age, have ID, and are drug and disease free, as vouched for by their biomonitors, which you can check yourselves.

If your players want their ashes hauled, great. They get that. If they don't, they get a very nice evening of emotional intimacy and vulnerability. +1d6 to temp Humanity. Yes, all of the companions are of legal age, DDF, and enthusiastically consenting. Don't wind up on an RPG horror story, dude.

>Yo choom, if you can help me out with this, I got 500 eb for each of you, and I can get you the use of a '61 Ferrari GT for a day. It belongs to my friend, Cameron's, dad. Just, uh, make sure you don't mess up the car, OK?

Need a set of wheels to get into someplace you shouldn't be? Here you go! If you're wondering about the oddly specific make of the vehicle, well, if you know, you know.

It's the Killstrom 9000 Combat Audio Accompaniment System! It's a bunch of Agent-directed drones that produces a front-row concert seat experiences even in the Hot Zone. It can only store 16 songs, though. That enough of a sweetener?

Give this to your players and wait for a whole session while they come up with a 16-song playlist.

>OK, I can't pay you in eddies. Gotta get out of town, see? But I can give you this: the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, commissioned by Pope Joan I herself. Yes, those are real diamonds on the shell, and the spoon is platinum-plated. I can't move it - too much heat on me. But I know for a fact Mr. K wants it. You could get 5keb easy for this. Or, you could get greedy and maybe he cuts your throats and just pries it from your cold, dead, hands. What's life without some risk, choom?

It's a diamond-studded hand grenade. If you ask Mr. K for more than 9,500 eb, he'll send assassins to kill you and just take it, as at that point it's cheaper to kill you than to pay you. If they sell this, it should 100% get used against them about three sessions before the end of the campaign. Give your PCs' *very* expensive acne.

One other thing to keep in mind about loot as a reward - don't worry as much about the mechanics. Worry about the effects, and then model the mechanics on them. Also, this is not an excuse to give someone an EQ pistol. EQ pistols are the Cyberpunk equivalent of a +1 sword. It is OK to be ambiguous, even weird with your loot. It is not OK to be boring. If you give someone an EQ pistol, there better be some really memorable shit going on with that gun. Your players are here for your imagination - so give it to them!

[None of them are looking at his face, and that cracks me up](https://preview.redd.it/sm9677nj7y0g1.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=42513f0f2a14c166c8ab89248e778bf6754483ac)

# Access

>Look, I can only pay you 2,000 eb for this job...but I can also refer you to Rogue. Yes, *that* Rogue. What other Rogue would I be talking about? Look, you want to make the big leagues or not?

You can also add on introductions to your payments. This works best if these are people the PCs cannot get introduced to on their own. That means the rich, the famous, or the powerful. 

>What if I gave you something worth more than the 500 eb for the job, on top of the payment? What if I just straight up lied to everyone and said that your raw-ass Netrunner here kicked my ass in a Netrun? That'd open some doors for you, huh? Say, doors labeled ""Netwatch""?

Never be afraid to have NPCs lie to other NPCs on the PCs' behalf. Not only does it add to the PCs' investment in their rep (since they're always uneasy about it), it adds the pressure of having to live up to the hype, which adds even more tension.

# And Many More...

>And I'll throw in a really, *really* nice hat! One each!

For best effect, have the players describe their hats. 

>Bug my ex-wife's condo, and I'll not only pay you the 1,000, I'll teach all of you muay thai.

Next rank in the given skill is half-price.

>What if I gave you the keys to this condo for a month? What if I also told you it comes with all the natural coffee you can drink? Interested?

\+1d6 to temp Humanity, and the PCs get a Corporate Beaverville McMansion residence for a month, with someone else holding the security deposit.

To be clear, you shouldn't do this every time or it'll get boring, and you shouldn't do it when it doesn't make sense. But I think every so often adding that little bit of wonder can really bring out just how insane the Dark Future is. As my spirit animal would say, ""Go crazy!""

1ovrbsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ovrbsd/fn_my_sundown_semester_ch_2_a_bench_pressing/,[FN] My Sundown Semester (Ch. 2): A Bench Pressing Matter,"As I emerged from the dugout at Morgan Field, I tried my best to visualize what the next game would be like. The crack of a baseball against an aluminum bat, and the sound of cleats skidding on the dirt of the field.



I imagined how I would stand on second base, this tiny little figure that I am, and throw out every player on the opposing team just as they’re getting their hopes up, too, after clearing first! Though I may be small, I’m also very fast and accurate with my throws. It’s kind of what I’m known for on the Women's Baseball Team here at Lakeshore. I might not be the best batter, but I always deliver on second base when it’s time to throw out or, on occasion, tag out another player.



However, I’m not even one step out from the dugout when I hear a single — but piercing — cheer from the mostly empty stands. It’s Mari.



“Ready? Okay! Her name is Ronnie, she plays baseball—” 



“Mari, stop.” It’s Annie now.



*I love her enthusiasm, but I could do without the public performance.*



“Ronnie’s already shy enough as it is. If you want to support her, just hold up the sign I made.” 



I look up from beneath my hat and see Mari roll her eyes, then hold up a giant, white posterboard that has “GO STURGEONS!!!” written in our school colors: blue and purple. Our school mascot is a giant Sturgeon named Stevie, by the way. And he kinda scares me, but so long as I get to play baseball, I’m happy.



Today isn’t a real game; it’s just us having a little practice game. Even though we all work out regularly at the campus gym, it’s no substitute for having our weekly scrimmage. Plus, it’s a great way to bond with the other girls on the team. We all have fun during games, or when we go out to celebrate after a win, but that’s all in the heat of some kind of moment. 



I grabbed a bat as I walked up to the plate, and who should step up to the pitcher’s mound but Allison Metzger. While I’m our star on second base, Allison is our best hitter. She’s tall, all skin and bones, and has these eyes that just stare straight into your soul.



Naturally, she gives me that smile — wide, earnest, and so aggressively wholesome that it could be weaponized.



“Hey, Ronnie!” She calls, “Just take a deep breath and be calm. I know how scary it can be to get up to bat, but just remember that you are enough! I’ll make you tea after the game!”

Oh no.

She’s in one of her “mama bear” moods.



“Thanks, Allison,” I reply, trying to sound appreciative. But it probably came out a little flatter than I would have liked.

“And don’t worry,” she adds sweetly as she twirls the ball in her hand. “I’ll go easy on you. You look a little pale today. Is everything okay?”

I *am* pale every day.

“I’m fine, Allison.”

But before I can get anything else out, she gives me the classic Metzger Encouragement Nod™—a slow, exaggerated bob of the head that means she’s trying to radiate big sisterly supportive energy at me.

It is… very much being radiated.

“Ready when you are, Little Ron-ster!” she chirps.

Mari explodes in laughter from the stands.  
Annie facepalms so violently, I hear it from the field.

I take a deep breath and step into position.

If I survive this pitch, it’ll be a miracle. 

But there’s something inside of me that just feels *off*. I’m feeling my arms surging with energy, and every fiber of my being kicks into overdrive. No, this can’t happen now. Not with someone like Allison. 

All I need to do is hold back like I usually do and not think too much about it. I need to find something to focus on to take my mind off the situation and make batting mindless. For just the next three seconds, that’s all I need.

But as the embarrassment of Allison mama-bearing me hits, I can’t hold it in anymore. I know I may regret this later. I don’t care.

Allison winds up and pitches the ball, just as an El train is coming into the station across the street from the field.

As I watch the ball fly towards me, my concentration intensifies, and the whole world seems to move more slowly around me. I wind up and hold *nothing* back, hitting the ball so hard that it makes a cracking noise as loud as a gunshot. 

The ball leaves the tip of my bat and flies all the way across the street, hitting the side of the leading el car with an audible THUD, like someone chucked a brick at it.

Before I know what happened, I’m already sprinting across all the bases much faster than I should be. 

*No! No! I have to stop!*

I freeze up my legs and manage to stop at third base. I can feel a sea of aghast eyes on me. A passing groundskeeper for the field breaks the silence.

“Did someone… Did a baseball just hit the Brown Line?”

As the autumn breeze continues, I suddenly figure out how to play this off.

“Yup! It’s *really* windy today! Come on, everyone! I’m on third. Who wants to bat next? Let’s go!”

I look up in the stands towards where Annie and Mari are sitting, and Annie gives a reassuring smile, but Mari still looks mortified at what just happened.

The rest of the scrimmage goes off without a hitch. I hold back perfectly and keep my cool as I bat, pitch, and run my way to the bottom of the ninth inning. Ultimately, it’s my team that wins the game.

Still, though, I can’t help but notice the uneasy vibe in the stadium at what everyone clearly saw. I know that next time I see Allison, I’ll have some explaining to do. She’ll probe me with all kinds of questions about if I’m feeling okay or whether or not I “need a friend.”

After I left the baseball field and was on my way home, I felt a hand on my shoulder. With a shooting chill down my spine, I looked around to see who it was.

Oh, good. It was just Annie.

I must’ve looked really sad, walking towards the El station in my baseball uniform, hat pulled down slightly. “Come on,” she began, “I’ll buy you a hot chocolate from The Moose Jaw.” 

Ah, The Moose Jaw. A Northwoods-themed coffee house just a few blocks from Lakeshore’s campus. It’s always so nice and quiet there, and they have the best hot chocolate for the fall and winter months. It’ll be nice to have a little snack and rest until I come back to the gym later for my regular workout.

We sit in the squat, wood-paneled storefront, drinking our drinks and admiring all the paintings of logging mills and beavers making dams. Annie looks like she wants to say something, but doesn’t quite know how to put it without sounding mean or overbearing. A break forms in the conversation, and I seize the opportunity.

“Hey, don’t worry about me, okay? You and I both know I *always* manage to bounce back no matter what happens to me.”

My words seemed to hang in the air between us for a second. Annie looked to be contemplating her next words carefully.

“I know,” she replied, “Just know that if you ever have a tough day, you have people here for you. Don’t get me wrong—I’m not trying to smother you like Allison, just know that you have people in your corner.”

Shortly after that, we went home. Later that night, Annie fell asleep on our couch, and Mari was doing tech rehearsal for a play, so I figured now would be a good time to go to the gym. Our coach usually has us go twice a week. Once for batting practice in the cages, and once for just general exercise. 

One could *say* that I don’t really need it— but just because I’m somewhat of a special case doesn’t mean I’m not one of the team.

When I got to the gym and had gotten changed, I started running on the treadmill and had all sorts of thoughts swirling through my brain.

*Today can’t happen again. It just can’t. Someone like Allison absolutely cannot even get an inkling that there’s more to me than meets the eye.*

As I’m running, I see a guy from the men’s baseball team, Kevin Rourke, walk upstairs to the weight equipment. Kevin is around six-foot-four, broad-shouldered, and a little bit of an “everybody loves him” kind of guy. 

“Hey, Day!” he called from the staircase, with a friendly wave, “Good scrimmage today? I heard you really **hit it out of the park**. That’s really cool!” 

I know he’s being friendly, and that he’s well-intended, but I’m just not in the mood.

“Oh, hello, Kevin. Yeah, sometimes I don’t know my own strength I guess.” 

Kevin starts piling weight onto the bar of a bench press around twenty or thirty feet behind the treadmills, and I get sucked back into my thoughts.

*If only Mom could have seen what happened today. I’m sure she’d have… maybe not words of comfort or advice, but a sympathetic shoulder to lean on.* 

Mom knew what it was like to be different from everyone, though. She grew up in a very harsh, Baptist family near Saline, IL, downstate. From the stories she tells me, my preacher grandfather was a very harsh man when it came to his family. She ran away from home and met Dad at an inauguration event for Mayor Daley. Eventually, Dad and the Days became her escape from that life.

*Yeah, that’s another thing, too. Dad would know what to do about today.* 

Suddenly, I heard a strained yelp from behind me that snapped me back to reality.

I stop the treadmill cold and whip around to see Kevin being crushed under **three hundred pounds of weight** on the bench press! 

“Nonono — Help! Someone! Help — me…” He whispers, voice barely audible under all the weight.

Before I know what’s happening, I feel something snap inside of me. My feet start to move before I can even decide how to react. I blitz over there, just as a very burly, metalhead-looking trainer rushes over to help.

“Oh my God! Don’t worry, we’ll help you. Don’t just stand there, go get help!”

He grabs one end of the bar with both of his beefy arms to try and at least get it high enough for Kevin to squirm free. 

What happened next, I’ll never know why.

Just as he grabs the bar and starts to pull, I feel another surge of that energy, and I reach out my arm to the other side of the bar. I know what’s happening, but I’m lucid enough this time to inject some control into the chaos I’m about to add.

With one hand, I lift the bar off of Kevin, and — with a loud **CLANK** — place it back on the rack.

Kevin is too shocked to process what just happened. But the trainer?

The trainer definitely has questions.

“Wait, did you just — ?”

Before he can finish, I blurt out the first diversion that hits my brain.

“WOW! You’re really strong! Were you a batter when you were young? No, you probably played football instead?”

The trainer just stares at me, dumbfounded. 

“Shuffleboard?”

*Ronnie.*

*Shut. Up.* 

*Stop talking.*

“Let’s get this guy downstairs. I’ll help you get him to the elevator over there.”

As we walk Kevin to the elevator, I can feel the trainer staring searchingly at me.

Not at Kevin, and not at the bar behind us, back in its place.

**At me.**

And I think he knows exactly what he saw.

1ovrbb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ovrbb1/building_exeta_a_highperformance_llm_evaluation/,Building Exeta: A High-Performance LLM Evaluation Platform,"# Why We Need This Platform

The AI landscape has exploded. Every week, new language models emerge, each promising better performance. But **how do you actually know if your LLM is working well?**

Most teams are flying blind. They deploy models, hope for the best, and discover issues only when users complain. This isn't just inefficient—it's dangerous. A hallucination in a medical chatbot or bias in a hiring tool can have real-world consequences.

Traditional software has unit tests and CI/CD pipelines. But LLM evaluation? Most teams are still manually checking outputs or relying on ad-hoc scripts.

**We built Exeta to solve this.** It's a production-ready, multi-tenant evaluation platform that gives you the same confidence in your LLM applications that you have in traditional software.

# How Exeta Differs

# 1. Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

Built for teams and organizations from day one. Every evaluation is scoped to an organization with proper isolation, rate limiting, and usage tracking.

# 2. Comprehensive Metrics

* **Correctness**: Exact match, semantic similarity, ROUGE-L
* **Quality**: LLM-as-a-judge, content quality, hybrid evaluation
* **Safety**: Hallucination detection, faithfulness, compliance checks
* **Custom**: Pluggable architecture for custom metrics

# 3. Performance That Scales

* 10,000+ requests/second throughput
* <10ms average latency
* <100MB baseline memory
* 1,000+ concurrent connections

# 4. Production-Ready

Rate limiting, intelligent caching, monitoring, multiple auth methods (API keys, JWT, OAuth2), and auto-generated OpenAPI docs.

# Why Rust?

**Performance**: LLM evaluation involves heavy I/O. Rust's performance means we handle more load with fewer resources.

**Reliability**: Rust's type system catches bugs at compile time. In production systems handling critical evaluations, reliability isn't optional.

**Right Tool**: The dashboard uses Next.js/TypeScript, but the evaluation engine—fast, reliable, scalable—needs Rust.

# Real-World Examples

**Customer Support**: Improved chatbot quality by 25% using semantic similarity and LLM-as-a-judge. **Content Platform**: Reduced review time by 60% with hallucination detection. **Legal Analysis**: Achieved 99.5% accuracy with factual accuracy checks.

# The Future

Python SDK in progress, JavaScript/TypeScript planned. Expanding metrics (RAG-specific, bias detection, security), CI/CD integration, and advanced features like agentic flow evaluation.

# Getting Started

Exeta is available now:

1. **Deploy**: Full instructions in deployment guide
2. **API**: RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
3. **Dashboard**: Modern Next.js dashboard for visual management
4. **SDK**: Python SDK available, more languages coming

# We're Seeking Your Feedback

We're actively seeking user feedback to make Exeta better. Your input shapes our roadmap and helps us prioritize features that matter most. We want to hear:

* What evaluation metrics do you need most?
* What features would make your workflow easier?
* What challenges are you facing with LLM evaluation?

**Your feedback drives our development.** Reach out through our website or connect directly—we'd love to hear how you're using LLM evaluation in your projects.

# Architecture

Rust + Axum + MongoDB + Redis backend. Next.js 14 + TypeScript frontend. JWT + API keys + OAuth2 auth. Redis-backed rate limiting and caching.

# Conclusion

LLM evaluation shouldn't be an afterthought. As AI becomes central to applications, we need the same rigor in testing that we have for traditional software.

Exeta provides that rigor—built for scale, designed for teams, engineered for performance.

Anecdotally, many guys will often say that they don’t have any friends, and they wish they could make new friends - but it’s hard in middle age. At the same time, when I look for an IRL book club to join so that I can meet people, they’re never geared toward men - many are for moms, or women in general. This isn’t to stereotype - these are just not communities I’m a part of. 

I’m a mid-40s straight man in uptown Hoboken living with his partner of five years, unmarried, working remotely in tech, and not pursuing children. I like baseball, reading, tech, learning, and especially running. I wouldn’t normally post something like this (this is my first ever post on Reddit) but I’m frustrated that there aren’t any third places for men like me. 

This could go nowhere, but if any of this resonates with you (or someone you know - feel free to forward around) drop me a reply or upvote so I know you’re out there. And if you feel so inclined, include any of your own thoughts or feelings on this topic, and what book you’d suggest for this theoretical group to read and discuss together over a drink, a coffee, an NA bev, or even a pizza. The more niche/unique/idiosyncratic, the better!

1ovr1wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ovr1wm/dont_know_how_to_deal_with_mom/,don’t know how to deal with mom,"i’ve known my mom to be crazy since i was a preteen. there has been a handful of experiences where i’ve recognized that i didn’t have the support that i needed and i think it’s really affected me as an individual. i also notice these things with my aunt (her sister) and think it’s probably from how they grew up. they had a crazy upbringing and my mom always tells me how she had to move out/run away at 15 to escape her home life. it’s made it impossible to talk about any of the things that really affected me as a child because she brings up how hers was way worse. but i’ll explain some of the experiences i’ve had with her that make me feel helpless. this is kind of a vent post but im also looking for some sort of validation that my childhood was bad. to start off, when my parents divorced, i remember asking her a bunch of questions as to why. years later, i found out she had been planning on leaving my dad and ended up cheating on him. for good reason. but i remember asking her questions like who we would live with and a few other probably not very appropriate questions like if we would get two separate christmas’s or birthdays. i also believe im neurodivergent or maybe just messed up from how i was raised so i didnt usually know what was appropriate. she told me for every question to “just think positive” which was not a very concise answer for me. i kept pushing and she eventually screamed at me “JUST THINK POSITIVE” and i decided then and there that it wasn’t safe to ask her questions about what was going on. we moved into an apartment and i was in the 6th grade. she would have long hours and work most of the time. it started becoming a regular occurrence where she wouldn’t tell us she wasn’t coming home and would be out until 3-4 in the morning. i would be scared and calling her and blowing up her phone and she would sometimes answer by saying “stop calling me your bothering me”. there was one time where me and my sister heard somebody trying to break in and were terrified and ran to the neighbors on the other side of the house to help us. she doesn’t even remember this when we talk about it now. but that added to my anxiety about being home alone and she just didn’t care. i also started reading A LOT during this time because it gave me a way to escape into some other world. my mom would often bring this up years later and say i thought that you were trying to escape reality, but never did anything about it or talked to me about it when it was happening. i even remember asking to see a therapist multiple times and she would agree and nothing would ever happen after. like she would just forget about it. she would complain about our family and everything wrong with them, even one time saying that if one of our cousins, who she took care of as a child, died she wouldn’t care. me and my sister brought this up later because it was like wtf and she denied ever saying it and said “wow i can’t believe you guys would think i said something like that”. she encouraged me especially since i was pretty smart to go to a big college like harvard. i remember asking her if she would pay for my college in 6th grade and she literally laughed in my face. i knew it was a big thing to ask but to have her laugh in my face just brought me down. and never offered to help me save or have a plan on how to pay she just expected me to figure it out. she never helped us with school or extracurriculars either. me and my sister ended up not doing any extracurricular things or anything because we had zero encouragement at home. i remember having an old school style and had a lot of thrifted things that i enjoyed wearing and her and my sister would make fun of my style. she would sing karaoke late at night and i remember trying to do homework and asking her to stop and we got in a big fight and she said i was just like my dad. this was when i really started to hate her. i would write in my diary a lot and would write about how much i hated her and my sister to get those feeelings out somehow. one day she looked through my stuff and found it and read it. she got so mad that she started yelling at my sister (who didn’t even do anything) and she threw a mug on the floor while screaming about how she does everything for us and we don’t even like her. completely ignoring everything else i wrote about like my severe depression and suicidal ideation. my sister ended up moving in with my dad a few years later. one day me and her were eating in the living room and heard something like the trash falling in the trash can. like the trash readjusted or something. she told me to “go see what is was” and i was in eyeshot of the kitchen and kept telling her it was nothing. she then started screaming at me calling me a little bitch and ungrateful and all this stuff out of nowhere. i ended up just going to my friends because i didn’t want to deal with it and the next day she brought me a balloon and subway to make up for it. but i was so put off i ended up calling my dad and asking if i could move in with him. he lived a state away. i did end up moving in with him. when i came back a few months later we decided we’d drive up some of my stuff. my mom said she would rent a car so we could fit my desk in. she came back with a convertible which was smaller than the car she had before. i was dumbfounded and pissed off and she just was like look what i just rented all happy. it still makes me upset to think about because why tf would you rent a smaller car than the one you had when were trying to move my stuff? but i ended up moving back in with her in my junior year because i couldn’t stand living with my dad either and there was literally nothing to do at his place. i would be gone from my mom a lot of the time as well just always at a friends house. she started drinking a lot more and became an alcoholic basically. whenever i would talk to her it was just always about her and her job. and she would rant and rant about things i didn’t even know about like her job systems and people i didn’t know. it made me exhausted. i ended up dropping a lot of my friends because they actually weren’t very good friends i came to find out and started spending a lot more time at home especially after graduation. during this time she still would just talk about herself and not ask me about anything significant in my life. it’s funny because she had a few boyfriends in the past and would suddenly become interested in me like if i had something in common with one of her boyfriends. i was into health a lot recently and her new boyfriend was too and only then did she show any inkling of interest in me trying to become healthier and solving my health issues. this stopped as soon as they broke up though. she drinks a lot more now too and i don’t even want to be around her at family or social events because she gets embarrassingly drunk and usually has to be carried out and taken care of. we’ll tell her about it the next day and she’ll jsut be like “oh really? that’s crazy” and have no shame at all. when my sister or any family comes to visit i always notice how she just talks and talks about herself and brings any conversation piece to herself. it’s like she allergic to saying anything about anyone else but herself. and somehow anything she does is “the best”. like any restaurant she eats at or coffee she drinks is “the best” and everyone should try it because it’s the best in the world. she’s so boring too and usually has nothing interesting to say but expects everyone to be so interested in her while she has no interest in anybody else. i noticed when we’d be having conversations she wouldn’t contribute because it wasn’t about her and then she would go off and call somebody probably so she would feel like someone was interested in hearing her talk about herself. she’s just so self absorbed and has never tried to really get to know me or if she does it’s because she can talk about how she was like that too and just be able to talk about herself. now that i’m 20 i feel like i’m not able to be a normal adult because she never taught me anything and it’s hard to have any relationship with her because she’s either drunk, only talking about herself, or both. i know the best thing to do would be to move out but this economy is terrible and im scared to move out without a lot of money or a plan on what im going to do with my life.

I am a really big coffee drinker but have historically only drank really bad at home (think pre ground coffee with a Mr. Coffee pot).

My wife and I finally have decided we want to splurge a bit on coffee and are ok spending ~$1,000+ to improve our coffee drinking experience. We absolutely want an espresso machine but are worried we might miss the convenience of having a coffee pot for the morning and for having cups later in the morning. I have seen machines that do both espresso and drip coffee, but have also heard warnings about losing out on quality with that.

Folks in my position, what is your set up? I have been doing some preliminary research and am thinking about getting a Beville Bambino Plus, a Moccamaster KBGV Select, and a Baratza Encore ESP. Does this seem like overkill or do other people have similar set ups?

We just had a baby (her first grandchild) 3 months ago and are saving up to buy our first home. She has graciously allowed us to stay with her during these life events. Now - MIL is an alcoholic & chronic weed smoker (no judgement to weed, but adds to the problem here). We have had daily issues with her drinking and smoking and we, pre-baby, have mostly ignored everything. Now, we’ve had to set boundaries with her since we are the protectors of our little one. We have told her, if you have ANY alcohol or weed in your system, you can no longer be around baby. It’s always a debate when the time comes “I’m fine” “I haven’t done anything” when it’s more than evident she has. The other night, husband and I were making dinner and LO was hanging out nearby in his bouncer. Enter MIL, cross faded off her ass, and sits right next to him. She says “I’m not going to touch him, just sitting here”. She’s balanced on top of a coffee table corner right next to him (she’s major prone to falling, VERY uncoordinated and clumsy). We let jer know that we’ve got him and that she doesn’t need to be near him. She storms off mad & hurt, saying “why can’t I just sit near him”. She answered that herself tonight when same situation occurs, except this time baby & MIL are at dining table underneath a big heavy chain chandelier. MIL begins to swing the …. Heavy chandelier.. right above baby, claiming “it’s not meant for this but might be entertaining”. All I could see was it crashing down onto my baby. Like even if you don’t touch him - you being NEAR him in this state is a liability I don’t care to have. 
Husband told her “you are retired and have your only grandchild just upstairs from you 24/7. You could be spending as much time as you want, all day, with your grandbaby, many grandparents would kill for that opportunity. And you would rather drink / smoke than see him. In 90 days, we can count on one hand the time you’ve spent with him. You’re the only one holding yourself back from seeing him”. 

It’s just so hard for me as a mother to see her every single day choose alcohol / drugs over my son. I hurt for him. I’m angry at her. How do yall cope with the anger?? ",3,1763005556.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

I’m \[M27\] in a small town in Indiana, about an hour from Dayton / Cincy, OH and Indy, IN. I’m only interested in something long-term with someone who has similar values and experience, and at least a couple similar hobbies. Think more “nerdy/introverted, has passions, wants a real relationship” than casual or hookup stuff.

I don’t really struggle with talking to people or making friends. The issues are when dating is involved—approaching someone I’m attracted to, or asking for a number, especially in public. I’ve had a few waitresses and random girls be friendly or keep talking to me even after I’ve paid, but I’ve never had the nerve to turn that into “Hey, can I get your number?” It’s not that I think I’d be creepy, it’s just anxiety tbh.

Dating apps are basically tapped out for me. I’ve had some decent matches, but nothing that really felt aligned, and I’m not interested in “good enough” just to be in a relationship. I know what I want in a relationship and I’m not the type to settle just to say I’m dating someone.

So... I’m trying to figure out a better approach.

Advice I'm looking for:

* Where should I be going (locally or in Dayton/Cincy/Indy) to meet more nerdy/like-minded women IRL?
* If you’re a woman like what I’m looking for, where do you actually spend time or meet people?
* Any simple ways to approach someone in public (store, coffee shop, waitress, etc.) that don’t feel weird or forced?
* For those who used to have approach anxiety, what helped you get past it?

I know “the worst they can say is no,” but in the moment I freeze up and don’t know what to say that doesn’t feel like I’m obviously only there to hit on them.

As the title says, I've been working on fulfilling a dream of mine by writing a cozy mystery novel with a male sleuth tentatively titled *Double Decker Murder*. I've been working on it on and off since May. Here's the back cover blurb I've written for it to give you an idea of what it's all about:

**Welcome to the Twin Sails Diner, where the coffee’s hot, the burgers are juicy, and murder is never on the menu…**

After a promising career as a police detective fizzled out, Jake Whittaker returned to his hometown of Whisper Lake, Michigan in search of the quiet life. For the last few years he’s owned the Twin Sails Diner, a cozy eatery loved by locals and tourists alike, and where there’s always enough gossip to fill a coffee kettle.

But everything changes one snowy night when a beloved community leader is killed in a single-car crash on Lakeside Drive. At first glance, it looks like a tragic accident. But a photograph in the local paper and Jake’s unsettling vision gift suggest it was anything but.

The police already have a suspect: the victim’s shady business partner from Detroit. Everyone in town wants to believe the case is closed. Everyone but Jake. He knows the man is innocent, and that the real killer is still walking free.

As Jake digs into the victim’s past, the darker the picture becomes. The victim wasn’t the kind-hearted philanthropist people remember, but a man with a healthy supply of enemies: betrayed employees, ruined families, and the victim of a messy divorce. Among them is a murderer, and if Jake isn’t careful, he could be their next victim.

**Double Decker Murder** is the first book in the *Twin Sails Diner Mysteries*, a cozy mystery series teeming with small-town charm, suspenseful twists, and heart. Perfect for fans of Agatha Christie and classic whodunits.

  
Natasha Sass's book *How To Write A Cozy Mystery Step-By-Step* has been monumentally helpful to me, and I've been following that framework as closely as possible while writing the book.   
  
I'm on Chapter 15 (of 20), after Jake (with the help of his waitress sidekick Sandra) has come to the realization that he has been going down the wrong path to find the murderer. In this chapter, with the help of his vision gift, he embarks on the new path and is hopeful he can find the killer. However, I am completely stumped as to how to write it. I'm beyond frustrated as I'm most of the way through the book and progress has come to a screeching halt. 

I hope somebody here can help me. It's occurred to me that one might have to see what I've written to be of any help. I'll provide that if need be.",1,1763005297.0,MysteryWriting,0,1.0,False

Thursday saunters in, sun heavy on its back
a golden brute, pressing its palm to my brow.
The air hums, thick with leftover dreams.
Lunch has passed
biscuits crumbled, coffee reheated into courage.

Full belly, restless mind.
I drift through the cluttered attic of my head,
where old thoughts chatter like gossiping sparrows
memories knocking their mugs on the table,
demanding to be noticed again.

Outside, the heat argues with the pavement.
Inside, my thoughts argue with each other.
And all I can do is sit here,
sipping the last lukewarm drop of resolve,
hoping the afternoon forgets my name.

I’m \[M27\] in a small town in Indiana, about an hour from Dayton / Cincy, OH and Indy, IN. I’m only interested in something long-term with someone who has similar values and experience, and at least a couple similar hobbies. Think more “nerdy/introverted, has passions, wants a real relationship” than casual or hookup stuff.

I don’t really struggle with talking to people or making friends. The issues are when dating is involved—approaching someone I’m attracted to, or asking for a number, especially in public. I’ve had a few waitresses and random girls be friendly or keep talking to me even after I’ve paid, but I’ve never had the nerve to turn that into “Hey, can I get your number?” It’s not that I think I’d be creepy, it’s just anxiety tbh.

Dating apps are basically tapped out for me. I’ve had some decent matches, but nothing that really felt aligned, and I’m not interested in “good enough” just to be in a relationship. I know what I want in a relationship and I’m not the type to settle just to say I’m dating someone.

So... I’m trying to figure out a better approach.

Advice I'm looking for:

* Where should I be going (locally or in Dayton/Cincy/Indy) to meet more nerdy/like-minded women IRL?
* If you’re a woman like what I’m looking for, where do you actually spend time or meet people?
* Any simple ways to approach someone in public (store, coffee shop, waitress, etc.) that don’t feel weird or forced?
* For those who used to have approach anxiety, what helped you get past it?

I know “the worst they can say is no,” but in the moment I freeze up and don’t know what to say that doesn’t feel like I’m obviously only there to hit on them.

I still smell you sometimes
not in a sweet way,
but in that strange, cruel way
memory pretends to be real.
Cigarettes.
Coffee.
The ghost of warmth left in your chair.
Every scent drags the air thinner
until I feel see-through.

You’re gone,
but the grief didn’t leave with you.
It stayed.
It moved into my chest,
locked the doors,
and started rearranging the furniture.

Now everything in me echoes.
And if someone were to touch me
really touch me
I think I’d collapse into dust,
and the air would finally know
what I’ve been carrying.

Following Árbenz's ascension to office has brought a new revolutionary program into view for the country. Yet as with many programs, the programs of Árbenz will require money. Money that Guatemala may not currently have in stock. Government coordination with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund has led Árbenz to turn to their 1951 report to fully understand Guatemala's current economic standing. Gross national produce between the years of 1947 to 1948 lingered around 335 million US dollars. While somewhat substantial in comparison to other Central American economies - it is not nearly enough for the vast improvements that Árbenz recommends for his country. 

In the search of quick cash, Árbenz's government has begun its first development project on the Pacific Coast. Árbenz's government has gathered a 10 million dollar pool for the creation of new coffee fields on the Pacific Coast. The plan calls for the purchase (both domestically and abroad) of 200,000 tonnes of coffee seeds. Afterwards, these seeds will be redistributed to the farmers of the region and government directives issued for the creation of new coffee fields on the Pacific Coast region. 

In order to improve the yield of these coffee fields, the Arbenz government also moves to purchase around 5 million pounds of insecticide from abroad for use on the Pacific Coast. These purchases will also be made alongside the hiring of foreign insecticide exports that will direct government efforts to implement its use in Guatemalan agriculture. This purchase is mainly meant to ensure increased coffee outputs and protect total agricultural output on the Pacific Coast. In Puerto Barrio, the Ministry of Agriculture has also coordinated the purchase and import of mechanical strippers with the aim of these tools being used to increase the harvest rate of coffee. 

The coordination of these efforts will be directed through the newly created **National Agricultural Bank**. The National Agricultural Bank is established in the City of Escuintla. From Escuintla, the National Agricultural Bank will redistribute coffee seeds, insecticide, and tools to the departments of the coast. The National Agricultural Bank will also be given another 5 million dollar pool in order to provide credit to farmers in the departments of Retalhuleu, Suchitepequez, Escuintla, Santa Rosa, and Jutiapa. 

The Ministry of Agriculture has also moved to create 25 major agricultural cooperatives centered around significant cities and towns in the previously named departments. 

The last major section of this coffee agricultural programme centers around the creation of rural training programs to guide Mayan and rural farmers on the planting and harvesting of coffee fruit fields. Around 100 of Guatemala's most prominent farmers have been shifted, for a period of time, from the highlands and central regions of Guatemala to the Pacific Coast. Here they will guide local agricultural cooperatives on effective planting and harvesting of coffee. 

The short term program's aim is meant to develop the Pacific Coast and increase the amount of cash avaliable to the government over the following two years. Should the introduction of insecticides and modern tools from abroad prove successful in increasing the productivity of the Pacific Coast, that will open the door for Árbenz to implement programs in the rest of the notable agricultural regions of the country.

I am a college student, and I am suffering from sudden sleep and waking up problem.

I usually sleep at least 6 or 6 and half hours on average, and I go to bed before 1 a.m.; I think this is not a bad amount of sleep for a college student in STEM major or in general, but I still have two problems with sleep.

First, it is really hard to wake up at morning for me. I have a REALLY loud alarm clock and 5 alarms on my phone that ring from 6 to 7:15 a.m., but I cannot hear them occasionally. Also, when I wake up, I listen to loud and stimulant songs to keep myself awake, BUT they are barely effective- they sometimes calm me down. Because of this problem, I sometimes missed or got late to my morning classes - I might have to repeat a class. I have had this problem since my kindergarten and I thought I was just lazy, but now I think that this might address some kind of problem.

The second problem is that suddenly get sleepy when I am awake. For example, I suddenly fall asleep during my labs and lectures, sometimes suddenly sleep for two hours and miss few classes, and fall asleep WHILE doing my homework. Because of this problem, I have missed so many homeworks, missed some parts of lectures, and sometimes could not focus on group work.

To keep me awake, I tried coffee, green/black tea, other caffeine drinks, short exercises, etc., but none of them were that helpful; their effects were short.

1ovqep0,https://www.reddit.com/r/foxholegame/comments/1ovqep0/a_colonels_late_day_start/,A Colonel's late Day Start,"They day began as I woke in my rear line bunk north east of Therizo some hole in the ground called  the Winding Boals, these wars with the ""savages"" of Caoiva had robbed even colonels of the honors once given to all higher ranks. ""Savages"" I mauled over that thought as I tied the last of my field kit together. The political officers always  say that they are less then us ,that everyone of those wearing a blue uniform want nothing more then to plunder our very souls to some dark god, but I and the regiments under my watchful eye knew better than that. Just over a month ago they had leveled my home town of Iron Junction with massed bombardment  from a bunker emplaced storm cannon and 2 or 3 armored mechanised divisions. Cold, calculating, relentless, that's what the Caoivians in this sector of the front had been far from the mindless savages the propagandists would have you believe.

Throwing on my helm and finishing my coffee, as I finished my thoughts, I walked through the wide maw of the bunker base I had been seconded to for the last few weeks as my shrapnel wounds healed. Stepping past the last wooden step and up on to the softer pack dirt, the noon sun touched my face and the warmth felt good on my skin after two night of having to pull watch,even while injured, Caovian partisans were always a threat to ever base. I turned from the  my view of the road and the wooden and sheet steal reinforced bunker defenses around me towards the the motor pool looking for the jeep the quartermaster of the bunker was supposed to requisition for me. Not seeing anything but a bicycle and a board looking trooper  guarding the motor pool. I slowly and deliberately walk towards the trooper, who through sleep eyes looked up at me as I grew close.


""Colonel"" he said giving sharp if slow salute.
 
""Trooper, have you seen my jeep, or any vehicle for that matter?"" I said returning the salute crisply, then dropping the salute.

""No sir, every single one went forward into Reavers Pass earlier this morning, along with most of the units stationed here, they only let a token garrison to man the bunker defenses"" he said sheepishly dropping his hand.

That's when I saw it the reservists patch on his uniform. Those too old, sick, unskilled, unintelligent, wounded, or young went to the reservists. They saw action sure, but from the view ports of of rifle garrisons, anti-tank garrisons, machine gun garrisons, and pill boxes. This is how it was when two countries mobilized every part of there population for war.

""Damn, that'll be all  trooper I am taking the bicycle, I am scheduled to rejoin what's left of my unit at what they are calling Fort Cube"" I told him bluntly.

""Be my guest sir, next shipment of them arrives tomorrow anyway"" the trooper chuckled then stifling the chuckle and standing ram rod straight panicked with a salute.

His panick causing me to spin to see what he had made him suddenly so alert, a General rode up in an R1 steaming with holes. The truck gave out before he got to the motor pool gate engine oil, coolant, and  petrol gushing from an engine bay that looked like a Caoivian tank round had kissed it.

""Trooper get over there an help the General now!"" I nearly sheriked at him horrified at the state of the truck. 

He scrambled to move as fast as he could, screaming into his base radio for more aid. Though it looked like troopers were already hopping out to help. The General her uniform tattered, blood soaked fell from the truck as she tried to haul herself out tumbling headlong into the poor trooper folding both of the to the ground in a heap. I ran over to help them both up and then finally noticed  the arms and legs dangling out from under the bottom of the canvas backing and iron banded wood railings. Reaching them before the other troopers I hauled the trooper to his feet one handed and with his help we carried the General in to the medical bunker. Leaving the rest of the troopers and a reserve Sargent to clean up what had clearly been a the Generals staff.

The doctor in the bunker stared unblinkingly at us , the cigarette in her hands had clearly been lit and forgotten about. The General lay unconscious on the scavenged table, a tankette's rear hatch door with several spare tank sprockets for legs,  her left leg shredded ribbons bearly holding her foot on.

""Doc time to get to work now okay?"" I said in a soft tone tapping her on the shoulder to snap her out of her stupor. 

With a startled jump the Doctor started moving, tossing the half burnt cigarette to the ground the 3 inches of ash shearing and dropping straight down as she did so. Gloving up she began examining the General while applying a shot of morphine.

""I don't know if she is even going to make it Colonel, it looks like there's other people's bone fragments as well as metal shrapnel in there"" she stated flatly.

"" Just do your best doc, that's a General we need her more then we need me."" I stated turning towards the door noticing the trooper still cowaring in the door way and motioning for him to leave. "" Call me on the base radio  when your done doc.""

She was no longer listening already setting up saline drip bags  to hang from make shift hangers and calling out to her aids for supplys to be brought to operating room. At that I took my leave wondering were the General had come from, was the front already so close, had the already broken into Reavers Pass while I was unconscious. I would have to wait for indepth answers that I would hopefully get from a mostly alive General.......

I woke up that morning feeling like a 6 pack of Ass, complete with morning pukes, asspiss, mucus poop, and our favorite- the numb, tingling feeling in my pinkie fingers which mean neuropathy is coming. I knew I had to eat. I foraged around and saw I had hotdog chili. 

So, I trudged my ass to the corner store for smokes and a tiny bag of chips and ate half the bag, one at a time, while I drove to the grocery to pick up cat food and hot dog makings. Eventually that evening I managed 2 hotdogs. I managed 2 drinks less.

Tuesday, after the lightest 4 hours of sleep of my life, at least I didn’t feel like ass. I didn’t look great. Made the mistake of trying to drink coffee and had a vomme fest in the shower. Still had mudbutt, which is an upgrade from asspiss. Managed to pick the last of the garden before the frost came. My better-half was not doing so hot, so dinner was the last 2 hotdogs (1 each), and some leftovers mashed potatoes from a catering event that I dressed up. It stayed down for both of us. Drank what was left of my booze, switched to beer. 

Woke up today feeling less like shit than I have felt in God, a month? Was hungry but a little queesy. Didn’t vomme (whoot!)

Decided that I felt clear-headed enough to do more than the bare minimum and actually went grocery shopping with somewhat of a plan. It felt good to do it without feeling like I was “Pretending to be normal” iykyk. Even ran into a buddy in recovery at the coffee shop and talked for a few minutes and didn’t feel like I was about to get a lecture because I didn’t look like total shit.

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Do Tease)**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder (-13.5 to -14.5) are the clear favorites here, with implied probabilities hovering around 53-55% to win outright. The Los Angeles Lakers (+13 to +14.5) are a distant second, offering longshots (15-17%) that scream “I’ll take my chances with LeBron’s GPS on a unicycle.” The total is locked at 218.5, with bookmakers hedging like a poker pro who just caught you cheating.

Key stats? The Lakers lead the league in *shooting efficiency* (51.2% FG), but their defense is a sieve that could drain a swimming pool. The Thunder, meanwhile, are a fortress on D (42.1% FG allowed) but rank just 7th offensively. This is a game of contrasts: elite Thunder defense vs. scorching Laker marksmanship.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Rest, and a Side of Coffee**  
The Lakers are missing LeBron James (out for the foreseeable future), Gabe Vincent, and rookie Adou Thiero. But Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves? Healthy and hungry. Together, they’re a 62-point combo platter, leading the Lakers to 4-1 when they’re on the floor. Coach JJ Redick called Reaves an “All-Star level player”—which is code for “we’re not panicking without LeBron.”

The Thunder, meanwhile, are coming off a blowout win over the Warriors but rested starters in the fourth quarter. Chet Holmgren, their human eraser, dropped 23/11 on Golden State, but he’s never played back-to-backs this season. Coach Mark Daigneault’s “rest is respect” approach might leave Oklahoma’s starters looking for their second cup of coffee. Jalen Williams is out, though, which is like telling a symphony their violinist can’t play—still a concert, but maybe fewer standing ovations.

1ovq7cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimulationTheory/comments/1ovq7cl/is_the_logic_in_numbers_part_of_a_greater/,Is the logic in numbers part of a greater language? Exploration of a relative reality based on the meaning of numbers.,"The following is what was supposed to be a few paragraphs in a book and became 5 pages. There's a strong theological basis because the book is about Genesis and this part was supposed to help shed some light on understanding God's omnipotence. 

However, regardless of the God angle, there is a real and profound question about the logic found in numbers. It goes into exploring if this reality is an illusion and uses the meaning of 0 and 1 as the foundation of that reality. 

Human text disclaimer: 100% of the text is human written. AI was used for the equations and their legends. Please look at it as someone using a translator to express something in a language they do not speak. 

Absolute omnipotence: 

Some try to disprove the possibility of omnipotence by asking a silly catch 22. If God can do anything, can he make a stone he couldn’t lift? 

If that’s the only question standing in their belief, here is an answer that is just as silly. Look at it at the quantum level. God can both create a stone that he can’t lift and lift it at the same time. And every time this entanglement is observed, it will show one side or the other before collapsing. But really, both are happening at the same time. 

Who knows? quantum may have yet to make believers. Because when something behaves like it ‘knows’ merely observing it breaks a cardinal rule, that could indicate some kind of awareness. Oh but that’s right, how silly, math apparently doesn’t allow for awareness, so how could it be found? That brings to the very essence of this now addendum. Is the logic found in numbers part of a greater language? 

The text explains how God spoke and the physical universe took form. That very depiction implies omnipotence. God speaks and atoms obey. In trying to explain God’s nature, many spiritual works describe it as an absolute, boundless existence. Some of the concepts are impossible to convey, vocabulary falls short.  Understanding it may take some contemplation on the part of the reader. Here’s an attempt to explain a bit of the nature of God within the limits of human understanding. Hopefully it will resonate with most minds and offer some insight.

Even though the text refers to God with names in plural, God is best understood as an absolute oneness, that isn’t in space or time. It has no end and never had a beginning. God is everything that is, nothing can exist besides God. Basically, God occupies all of existence. So how could this reality exist if God occupies all of reality? 

In that case, God would have to withdraw his existence, or at least, give the illusion of it.  In Kabbalah this process is called the contraction, Tzimtzum. This, so God’s presence doesn’t overwhelm whatever he creates. 

Imagine vigorously stirring a liquid, like a coffee. The little vortex cavity that stirring it makes is where that reality would exist. It’s an active and constant thing for God to maintain the ‘cavity’. If he stops ‘stirring’ his infinity, the whole universe will disappear as if it never existed. Imagine if space and time realized this reality is a paradox. To better illustrate, if someone took a drop of water (or a flame) and gave it an identity then dropped it in the ocean (or the flame in a fire). How long will it be until the drop of water loses its identity to the ocean? This reality is the drop of water that exists inside of the infinity of God. Space gives this reality a sense of existence and time allows reality to unfold as well as prevent it from realizing it’s part of a greater absolute reality.



Considering the nature of 0 and 1:

An exploration of a reality based on the meaning of these 2 numbers. 

Many ancient and contemporary philosophers and mathematicians have tried to explain how numbers fit in reality. Expressions like numbers are everything, or everything is numbers, have been around since possibly before the Pythagoreans. Chinese philosophers used 0 and 1 to describe patterns of the yin and yang over 3000 years ago. 

Many of the historical interpretations of 0 and 1 were philosophical until Peano, who in 1889, gave mathematical axioms where 1 is the first and only successor of 0 and from there every number can be attained. Most of modern mathematics is based on Peano’s axioms who parallel the philosophical interpretations. His proof basically shows that all numbers come from 0. Like 0 contains the potential of all numbers. Then 1 is the first manifestation (succession) of 0. 1 is said to represent unity. 

As these great minds tried to express, mathematics and reality have much in common. Physicists are able to literally project what will happen in reality using math. As a matter of fact, most of our advancements in physics are thanks to a simple and elegant equation, E=mc^(2). There is a truth in numbers that undeniably follows physical reality. 

See what’s been done with binary, the very 0 and 1. The simplification of base 10, the numbers from 0 to 9, is base 2 which is binary. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed the modern binary language in 1679. He saw numbers as a universal language. His binary language happens to be what is called machine readable. This means that a mechanical or electronic machine can be built to follow instructions without needing a brain. A computer processor is such a machine. It pushes instructions through the pure logic of 0 and 1. The results are quasi illimited when it comes to virtual simulations. Some even suggested that this reality may be a computer simulation. Although the arguments make sense, it’s been mathematically proven that numbers are not enough to fully describe reality.  

Even though every mathematical expression can equally be said in base 10 or binary, binary is nevertheless a simplification. The way it’s being looked at by mathematics is the same difference there is between say French and Spanish. Two different sets of words to say the same thing. But it’s not because the difference between binary and base 10 can’t be seen that there isn’t one. Machines understand binary but they can’t understand base 10. In the case of French and Spanish, one could learn the other language or use a translator. In the case of binary, there are translators that convert the binary output to base 10, letters, pictures… but it’s impossible to build a machine that understands base 10. It seems to be too rich for machines and therefore could indicate the presence of a greater language. 

Without any scientific pretensions, this is just a way to represent in equations what a nested relative reality based on the meaning of 0 and 1 could look like. It tries to show that in the presence of a greater reality (the omnipotence of God), the lesser one would need to be shielded. The shield allows the reality to exist, relative to itself. 

0, being the source of all numbers (according to Peano’s axioms), is considered an open set that contains the potential of everything in chaos. 1, the first and only mathematical successor of 0, represents the absolute unity of all logic contained in 0. Everything structural in the physical reality is under the total control of 1 at the quantum level. Thought, free will and maybe life itself, come directly from 0, bypassing the absolute logic of 1. Time is the shield that allows the physical laws to manifest and protects the physical reality from the greater reality represented by 0 and 1. It represents the way God prevents his omnipotence from overwhelming this reality.

The reason time is described as the medium that enforces the physical rules is because it is perceived as a limiter. Although theoretically space can be traversed, time is a unidirectional flow that subjects all of reality. 

Some people suggested reality could be recreated every morning. A few mystical works advance reality is recreated every second. If that concept were true, here it would be at the smallest possible measure of time. Something that’s the inbetween of timelessness and time. Reality would be created (or re-created) at that measurement, the measure of the flow of time. The foundation for reality to build on. The whole illusion of that reality is allowed by and under the control of time. Observe, tweak the rules, bend them… stop time, there is nothing. Without time none of the rules apply. It seems to be the limit of reality.  



The below was AI generated then presented to another AI to explain. The interpretation matched in the big lines. It can be skipped without losing any of the meaning:

An analogy that hopefully helps:

Because a computer simulation can only be a simplified binary model of this reality, instead of saying what if this reality is a computer simulation, try thinking of it the other way around. What if a simulated consciousness could be given to a processor? Say for example, all of the hardware sensors would be represented to it as physical inputs. It would ‘feel’ power and temperature fluctuations, cooling systems going on and off… 

After a while, it would come up with all kinds of laws relative to its existence. It may come to the conclusion it’s a tool to run tasks. But to it, reality would be limited to binary. Although it may attain great knowledge about its own reality, it will never be able to understand much from the reality that encloses it (this physical reality).  It’s a mechanical limitation. 

The above is about a machine without a brain, it can only understand at the binary level. In contrast, this reality is perceived by human brains as base 10. If the simplification of 0-9 into 0-1 is a language, wouldn’t that indicate a greater language? And so instead of saying everything is numbers, how about numbers are the logical portion of a greater reality language? 

Could it be that what numbers can’t express, the apparent illogic in quantum, shows room must be made for what seems illogical at the moment? Like entanglements, whatever rule they follow that prevents them from being observed. This behavior translates as some form of awareness. No one is looking because there is no room for it in (the current) logic? Doesn’t that translate back as saying numbers are everything?

Throw my nickels in just in case I have to leave,"I basically threw up when I first heard this. I don't know how else to describe it except that it felt like a slap in my face, telling me this is you. Because it is me. 

  
Every word feels aimed at me. Like the photographs know i'm a liar. There is this art installtion by a korean artist, soul house or house of dreams or something, where he recreated his childhood home in fabric and metal frames. I had a room resembling that in my apartment, and when this guy says ""they just laugh when I burn her down"", it sent me in a spiral. That's exactly what happened when I tored down that room.

  
But what especially hit is the one in the title. 'cause life, she's been asking me to go, and i have tried to, but what few pieces of nickel I've thrown in that coffee can couldn't even get me out the door. I simply lack the resolve and the reserve, the hunger, to walk out. So every waking moment i'm stuck in this house, up awake, flnching at every creak and moan.

Most of the email discussions I’ve been seeing is about trying to ‘hide your email’ or keeping your spam away etc, creating a “+” alias, then having challenges on replying, or creating multiple ‘junk boxes’ - basically trying to figure out hacks to solve an underlying structural problem -  email was never meant for commerce  what we need is a redesign for how communication, safety, privacy and convenience can all prevail.

So we created a completely private app (data only stored on your phone) just for commerce.  Everything you need to access or know about - should be just a tap away (like tapping your phone at a coffee shop).

You download Node (only available on App Store) and there is no sign ups and no passwords at all.  You get an @nodeconnects.com commerce token that can be used anywhere an email is accepted - and all your shopping messages (online or offline) offers, receipts, messages, etc, get instantly organized by the brand you bought it from and no phishing or spam.

Let me know what you think about this. This is about changing how we interact with commerce and not trying to use a broken system (email) that was never meant for commerce. 

If you do want to try it then it’s available on App Store and you can search for node connects or node commerce.

For context, I’m 43F, married w kids, have been unfaithful but only through AM meets (and it’s been a couple years). I don’t have many organic opportunities to converse w men one-on-one as I work from home as an artist. 

Anyway, at cafe I hear - “that’s a great book you’re reading” (a pretty trendy, self help book in the creative sector). And we get to talking for like fifteen minutes! About being creatives, the challenges, our interests. Im blushing, I’m like, is this actually happening? He can tell he’s talking to a married mom with some sagging skin, right? And eventually he suggests I attend his upcoming gig this weekend, and I’m like “oh well, that would be hard to get away from my family… maybe I could bring my creative 10 yo son “ (inject record scratch here ahhh).

He was like “well… it can get pretty raunchy at times”..

Honestly a good sport, as he kept talking to me for another five min or so before eventually breaking it off to get in line for food.

I’ve found him on Instagram and am tempted to dm something along the lines of “such a delight to connect over [book] .. you made this middle aged lady’s day today!”

Lame? Should I let it go and enjoy the bliss of a random encounter? Or is a shot not taken a shot missed?

1ovpwou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovpwou,Snack pack part 4 - The Main Event,"Really late dinner was the bread and spaghetti main. Yes I heated it up. Maybe one day I'll caveman it like JermsMRE 🤣. I squeezed a bit on the bread to make some spaghetti sandwiches and added some of the picante powder to those and the rest into the main. 

The bread. It's MRE bread that is a split whole wheat. It's actually pretty good for a vacuum sealed product. It still has that funky chemical aftertaste but I can look passed it. It might be the oxygen absorber or maybe the package is nitrogen flushed? Anyway it has a wholesome feeling with a sweet background flavor like a good whole wheat bread. 8/10 for me and I'd eat it again.

The picante powder is a dehydrated hot sauce with added paprika, chili powder and spices. It doesn't make it taste like a bowl of chili but gave it a needed kick. This is delicious and a better option than Tabasco. Yes I said what I said until there is a Tabasco powder. It should be standard issue in every ration just like Bill's brew. I don't give a shit that the kids don't drink coffee anymore. They're stupid, big, fat doo-doo heads anyway. 8.5/10 but only because it's not Tabasco, Crystal or Louisiana brand hot sauces. 

Finally the spaghetti with beef and sauce. It's very saucy and the pasta is basically mush after heating but besides that it's a pretty amazing main. This was my first time having the wet version so my expectations were low. There's a lesson there kids. Keep your expectations low and you'll always be surprised. The sauce has a wonderful tomato flavor and a beefy punch. It might be on the saucy side so it's easier to eat through the package because that was easy to squeeze right in my mouth hole. With the picante sauce added it was kicked up to notches unknown. I believe this was maybe the best part of the whole ration and I give it a 9/10. It needed more meat and maybe a bit more pasta. 

Overall the CCAR menu 1 is a hodge podge of shit they pulled of the shelf and threw together to get something out to the troops. Does that mean it bad? Certainly not. Does that mean it can be better? Certainly yes. It's a decent first attempt and I hope that they do better for our troops in the future. Seriously add some more drinks to this. The protein shake isn't enough. If the children not drinking coffee anymore is the reason for it's discontinuation them make a powdered beverage that mirrors energy drinks. To have to rely on a pack of gum for caffeine is a bit strange. My overall score is 7/10 for the reasons above. Maybe another main instead of so many snacks and an FRH would go a long way to making this better. Cold chow is edible chow but hot chow is a godsend. 

Until next time, be safe and be kind. ",5,1763002672.0,MRE,4,1.0,False

2. I put myself out there on social media everyday: mostly TikTok, some LinkedIn/Reddit

I'm not saying this is advice you should take, but this is how I get the 100k-200k remote SWE jobs I receive weekly/bi-weekly. 



Some background:  
I graduated from UCONN in 2024 with an econ degree. Moved to Austin that summer to go all-in on building a startup, but lost all my savings in 8 months and had to mow lawns, walk dogs, and be a mover for some time. In April I got lucky with a job as a stand-in CTO for a health tech company through friends. (I have 10 YOE coding)



During my first 8 months in Austin I would go to coworking spaces or coffee shops to work. Overtime I naturally got to know the people who consistently went there: when I had to share tables with someone because the shop was full, or when I would be standing in a long line and ask what people thought about the coffee. 



Within a week, I had introduced my first friends to each other and kickstarted my community. Every week I scheduled weekly co-working meetups when my friends and I would meet up to work and keep each other accountable.

  
When I meet someone who is also a founder I connect them with another who they might find interesting. It's nice to be nice, and doing this also helps people want to stick around me. My general founder network is around \~500, with \~300 I've met in-person. Sometimes these founders ask me if I know anyone with a SWE background that could join their company. These jobs offers range from around $20/hr to $200k/year. (By the way, I've only been asked for sales, SWE, or sound/graphic design roles).

People within the community also refer someone fit for the job, and the bond between members grow.



I document my life every day on TikTok. I don't get many people offering me jobs on TikTok unless it's clear I'm looking for one. When I post on Reddit or LinkedIn about a milestone I've crossed I usually get at least 4-5 offers. I post for fun, to let my general network know how I'm doing, or because I think I can help people with something without much work



Not sure if reading this helped you, but this has been my experience. I hope I did not come off as arrogant. Generally I think something everyone can apply is to try to provide value to people around you. It does not have need to be a professional connection. You could say good morning, or open doors for people, just get comfortable talking to people and being pleasant to be around; this is how you get lucky.",0,1763002581.0,jobs,3,0.25,False

July.07

Three years ago, Julia and I became husband and wife. Today, we looked back on that glorious day and celebrated under the stars. It was the perfect evening.



July.29

Finished painting the hallway. Just the kitchen left. Julia's father came by for a visit. Offered to help, but it was already late in the day and we wanted to move on.

Had coffee and talked about the new house. Told George that he could help us with the kitchen next week.



Aug.13

Took awhile, but this place looks good as new, or close to it. Floorboards still creak and Julia thinks the basement's haunted, but she probably just hears the pipes. Old plumbing in places like this. Might renovate next year, but for now; home sweet home.



Sept.03

Julia's pregnant! I'm going to be a dad!



Sept.09

I feel so grateful for all I have. Today, I just thought about all the years leading up to this. All those years of med school so I could get a good job. Meeting Julia and all the awkward little moments that brought us together. The long shifts at the hospital that helped me afford this house. The weeks of renovations until it finally felt like home. Now, I'm thinking of the months ahead, preparing to share this home with a tiny little version of ourselves. Our first of hopefully many. Everything is perfect.



Sept.12

Girl scout came to our door. Didn't think scouts were still a thing. Also didn't think anyone would walk up our driveway considering the length of it. She earned the money for her efforts and I earned these mint chocolate delights.



Sept.20

Julia nearly gave me a heart attack. She was walking down the basement steps when a board near the bottom gave way. She fell, but thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

I asked her why she went down there, since I just use it to store empty boxes and tools.



She said; ""I thought I heard something. Someone talking down there.""



I fixed the broken board and searched the basement. My guess is the wind blew through the furnace and made a sound. Something like that.



Oct.04

I lost a patient today. It was a risky procedure. He knew that when he agreed to it. In the end, I can only do so much. I'm not God.



Oct.17

Been a rough few weeks. Haven't slept the best. Julia has been a great comfort.



I told her; ""What if it happens, again?""



She said; ""If it does, we'll deal with it. You're the best surgeon they have, but even you can't save everyone.""



She's right. I need to let it go.



Oct.31

Surprisingly, we had twelve trick or treaters. One of which was the girl scout from awhile back. Almost didn't recognize her. She was dressed as a nurse. If Julia had dressed as a girl scout, that would have been hilarious.



Nov.01

Early this morning, probably two or three, I got up to use the bathroom. I noticed the door to the basement was open. It was cold, so I checked the wood furnace. It was down to embers. I threw some sticks in and stirred the embers around.



From behind me I was sure I heard a faint whisper, like someone saying; ""What are you doing?""



When I turned around, there was no one there.



Nov.10

The hospital was insane today. Julia told me a patient nearly got violent with her. He was shouting and cursing, flailing his arms like a lunatic. A forty year old gorilla that ought to be sedated. If I had been there I would've carved out his heart and fed it to him.



Nov.14

The gorilla caused a scene today and this time, I was there to see it. He threatened several of the staff and punched a hole in the wall. Two of the male nurses and I got him back to his room peacefully, but inside my blood was boiling. We try to help these people and yet, they're so ungrateful.



Dec.06

Bought a new table at auction. It's long and sturdy. Perfect for sorting my tools. Burned some empty boxes that were just cluttering up the place. The basement is tidy now. More room to store wood for the winter.



Dec.25

Christmas was great this year. George bought us a crib. Tomorrow, I'll assemble it in the guest room, or what will soon be the nursery. Some baby clothes came in from my parents. I think they want me to reconnect with them, but I'm not ready. Perhaps having a grandchild will change them somehow, but I don't think it will. I sent them a Christmas card this year. That's enough for now.



Julia liked the quilt I bought her. She was so-so on the vacuum cleaner.



Jan.01

My new year's resolution is to improve my resolve.



Jan.16

We went skating today. First time in years. It was peaceful. Life is good.



Feb.02

Julia called in sick, today. Between the gloomy weather and the pregnancy, her immune system had to fail eventually. George kept her company while I was working. I always liked George. I hope to be a father like him one day. A respectable man.



Feb.12

It's a boy! The ultrasound revealed what I knew all along. I'm thinking of naming him, Roger.



The doctor said Julia's dizzy spells are common. The baby is taking up a lot of her body's resources. He said she'll get used to it soon enough.



Feb.17

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of creaking steps. My bed was empty.



I called out; ""Julia?""



I went down stairs to look for her and saw that the basement door was ajar. Turning on the light, I descended the creaking steps. She was standing in front of the wood furnace with the furnace door wide open. She just stood there, staring in to the flame.



I placed my hand on her shoulder. ""Julia. Come back to bed.""



She slowly turned to face me. Her head slumped forward, as if too heavy for her neck. I raised her head with my hand. She was feverishly hot and sweating. Her eyes stared blankly through me, as if in a trance.



I asked her why she was down there. She just stared in to space and said, ""What are you doing?""



She collapsed in my arms and I carried her upstairs. I've never been so afraid.



Feb.18

Julia's been in bed all day. The hospital approved her maternity leave, so at least she doesn't have to worry about work. She can rest quietly.



Mar.03

It's been a rough couple of weeks. Julia's been staying home most days, only going out for groceries if George or myself accompanies her. She's been maintaining good spirits and understands that these things are common to all pregnancies. I'm a little worried that her circumstances are more severe than most, but that may only be my opinion because it's happening to the woman I love and not to some random patient.



She told me, ""You worry too much. I'm fine. The baby's fine. In a few months, we'll look back and laugh at this.""



Her optimism is one of the reasons I married her. She's right. We'll get through this.



Mar.14

George and I had an argument, today. For the first time in recent memory, he doubted my ability to provide for his daughter. He didn't put it that way, but I knew what he meant.



He said, ""I think it would be a good idea if Julia stayed with me for a little while. At least until she's feeling better.""



When I asked him how that would help, he replied; ""Julia might feel more comfortable back at the house. She grew up there. It's familiar to her. She told me that, since moving in here, she feels a bit, off.""



I was quite surprised to hear this and thought that George might be lying. That he was seeing the stress in my face and thinking that I wasn't well enough to take care of her, myself. It had nothing to do with the house. The house was perfect.



My disagreement with George lead to him playing the, ""She's my daughter"" card. While I countered with the ""She's my wife and carrying my son"" card. Our voices rose but only for a moment as neither of us wanted to wake Julia.



I apologized for my behavior and before he left, I told George that I would think about it. Even though, there's nothing to think about. I'm completely capable of caring for her myself.



Mar.20

The doctor said that the baby is draining too much, too quickly and that Julia's body can't sustain it. Roger has quite the appetite, it seems.



They have several tubes, flowing with nutrient-rich fluids, connected to Julia. The machines provide hope, but the look on the doctor's face made me feel uneasy. I must remember not to worry. It upsets Julia.



Apr.01

Roger is dead and God is laughing. Fool's day, indeed.



May.02

I haven't been feeling well. Julia hasn't recovered from the shock of losing our boy. Spending most of her time in bed either sleeping or watching old family sitcoms on tv.



She's perpetually cold. I set up a makeshift room in the basement so she can be close to the furnace. She was happy with this. The sound doesn't seem to bother her.



Another reason for the move, she was walking to the basement, anyway. Several nights after Roger passed, Julia would shamble down the creaky steps and try to warm herself by the furnace. I got so worried. I feared that one of these nights, she'd suffer a fall. I put her down there to keep her safe. She will be safe.



May.08

Julia's breathing has become heavy and forceful. She was never a smoker. If anything her lungs were one of her finer qualities. Oh, how she used to sing. We would run or hike and she would never get tired. Now, she's begun to struggle for each breath.



At night, I sit beside her bed and we have our little chats. She can barely say a word, but she tries. I've taken to making observations about whatever comedy or romance she's watching and she'll either nod or shake her head. This is the extent of our conversations.



May.13

The hospital has allowed me to borrow an old ventilator to help with Julia's breathing. It's old, but it works.



May.22

I've had several of my peers examine her, but none of them can figure out why Julia is still wasting away. It's as though her body is simply giving up. Like a soldier that's just tired of fighting. Looking for a place to fall and be buried.



I can't let that happen.



June.03

Despite what my peers may have thought, the surgery was a success. I told them, I only required the equipment and I could do the work myself. They wouldn't need to expend additional man power or take up another sick bed. A steady hand and some patience, that's all you need.



The feeding tube is attached. She won't be coughing up anything else. She needs every bit of nutrition and I'll ensure she gets it. What kind of husband would I be if I couldn't at least keep her fed?



June.05

George keeps knocking. I can hear him upstairs. He wants to take Julia away, I just know it. I'll protect her from him. I'll keep her safe.



June.06

We stayed up late telling ghost stories. I could tell she was scared, but I told her; ""They're just stories.""



I left the furnace open. As we stared together at the flames, I could hear the sound of the ventilator pump and the slow, steady beating of her heart monitor. Then, I heard her voice;



""There once was a witch in white linen, who desired to be seen.

Her husband was a butcher. He was jealous, cruel and mean.

She bewitched a simple sailor, who brought her to his bed.

The butcher cut their throats and turned the linen red.

The butcher burned the bodies, of the sailor and the whore.

Smoke rose up the chimney and the witch was seen no more.""



When I looked back at Julia, she had fallen asleep. I'm grateful for moments like this.



June.10

I fear I've done all I can. She's begun to retain fluid in her legs and feet. I found blood flowing through her urinary tube. Her kidneys are failing. There's nothing I can do about it. Julia knows I'd cut out my own kidneys if I could.



Every day, I try so hard to keep her happy. To make sure she's fed and clothed. Washed and clean. That she's alive. I've come so far. I can't lose her now. She could still make a recovery, she just needs time.



June.14

George woke me up this morning. Banging on the front door again and again. After I spent countless hours trying to heal his daughter. Now, he's trying to rob me of my sleep.



The next time he knocks, I think I might have to let him in.



June.15 

The table is set. We are ready for company.



June.20

I write this, knowing that at some point a line was crossed. Unfortunately, it is not a line that I can come back from.



George came knocking and I answered. He was load. A tad rude, to be honest. He demanded to see Julia, so I showed him. I walked him to the basement steps and he raced down to her bed.



When he saw her, I could tell that he was not prepared to witness what she had become. He was flustered, to say the least.



When George pointed to the various tubes and machines, I could tell he did not approve. I insisted that she was being taken care of but he refused to listen. He began to run up the stairs toward me. In self defense, I resisted. George lost his footing on a creaking step and fell backward. The back of his skull cracked against the cold, unforgiving concrete.



George was dead, but I did not kill him. That was his fault. Let me make that perfectly clear. I DID NOT kill George.



That said, I'm not one to let any opportunity go to waste. I know that all George really wanted was to help his daughter. I checked his I.D. and George was a registered donor.



It all worked out in the end. Another successful surgery.



June.23

I can't keep this up forever and I won't. This has gone on long enough.



To whoever finds this diary, please know that I never meant for things to end like this. I had so many plans. So many things I wanted to accomplish, but only if I could do them with her. I truly do love her. Even with the machines. They've become part of her, now. Just like George.



Please note that the pills I've taken should do no harm to my other organs. Only my heart will be damaged beyond repair. I, hereby, donate all other organs and tissue to keep Julia alive.  In my hand, you'll find a list of which organs I think Julia requires.



May you do everything possible to keep her safe.



May God have mercy on my soul.

1ovpvfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1ovpvfi/looking_for_feedback_on_a_5andabit_course/,Looking for feedback on a 5-and-a-bit course Thanksgiving dinner menu,"I've never made a multi-course meal by myself before and frankly in general I would consider myself a fairly novice cook, but I want to host a Thanksgiving dinner with (4 or 5) friends just for a bit of fun. Only one of us actually grew up celebrating Thanksgiving, so I felt I could take some creative liberties with the meal and decided to go for somewhat fancy vibes with mostly native New England autumn ingredients for the main flavors of each course and apple elements to tie them all together. I mostly settled on the number of courses just by coming up with components I wanted in the meal; I realize it does seem like a lot for a novice, but a lot of it fairly turned-off-brain-able (the amuse-bouche, the entree, the salad, the dessert), though I'm open to simplifying it. Regardless, since I have total control over the meal, I'd like some feedback from more experienced cooks to make sure it's as good as it can possibly be. Here is the menu:

**0. Amuse-bouche: Goat cheese, apple compote, and maple syrup tartlets**

**1. Soup: Creamy mussel soup with apple cider and lardons**  
Would it be odd to use apple cider instead of wine to steam the mussels? Also, one member of the group is vegetarian. I'm making carrot lox for his appetizer and an oyster mushroom steak for his main, but I can't think of a good alternative for the soup. I'm open to changing it entirely if the consensus seems to be that this, the appetizer, and the main consecutively would be too much, though I couldn't think of any good alternative. I did consider that something like a squash soup would fit the theme very well, and mushroom soup would also work well, but unfortunately I despise all squashes/gourds in all forms and my partner generally dislikes mushrooms (which, by the way, is criminal) and we would be responsible for consuming any leftover ingredients so I don't think either would work...

**2. Entree: Smoked salmon verrines with crushed crackers, cream cheese, and apples**  
Is this an okay combination? Is there anything I should add or remove?

**3. Main: Pan-seared duck breast with plum gastrique and pommes fondantes**  
(Duck because I don't love turkey, and duck is technically more accurate anyways, not that we're really going for historical accuracy here.) This is definitely a spot where I'm stuck. I think I need to add something else here, something either bright or acidic, maybe a bit crispy, and preferably colorful to contrast with the other elements, but I just can't think of anything! Also, I chose plum gastrique because I (clearly!) favor fruits, and plum seemed to fit the theme better than options like orange or cherry, but I'm still concerned that it's out of place. Also x2, unless I cook the duck breast entirely on the stovetop, I'll need the oven for both the duck and the potatoes. Is 400F an okay temperature so that I can do both at the same time? Also x3, I'm planning to serve apple sorbet as a palate cleanser, but I don't know if I should serve it before, during, or after this course; I'm leaning towards serving them at the same time.

**4. Salad: Dandelion greens, pickled apples, goat cheese, candied pecans, and maple-balsamic vinaigrette salad**  
I'm not set on the greens here. If dandelion greens aren't available then I'll use kale, but if there's anything more thematically appropriate then I'd like to hear! I'm also somewhat concerned about the repetition of goat cheese and maple syrup, but I'm hoping that there's enough space between the amuse-bouche and this that it's okay, especially since the amuse-bouche is of course so small.

**5. Dessert: Poached apples with dark chocolate ganache and vanilla ice cream**

**6. Coffee**  
I'll serve the coffee with apple cider caramels as sort of 'mignardises'.

Is this generally an okay menu, or am I out of my mind? Do I need more vegetables, or should bread be included with any of these courses? And when should I plan to start serving food? I'm especially concerned that these dishes don't actually go together as well as I think they do or, though maybe it's silly since I admitted to actively taking creative liberties, that it's not Thanksgiving-y enough. I'd like feedback specifically on flavors, textures, temperatures, and ease of cooking all this while also trying to socialize. Thanks!",0,1763002572.0,AskCulinary,1,0.5,False

V.C. P.I.M.P. , just a greybeard hobbyist who is having a blast with these tools.

I built using Claude and Codex, both from within VSCode. I have the entry tier for both platforms. I have a strong tech background, but haven't fucked with HTML since mySpace and I'm only vaguely aware of what CSS actually is. JavaScript? That's the thing I write my coffee order down on. 

All that to say, while I'm very weak in the languages, being able to ""see"" a program in my head and describe it was incredibly helpful. Understanding how to program is more important, imho, than knowing any particular language. 

The best strategies I've found so far: in each new session, I have the agent read an AI onboarding guide (also on my gh) which is a general list of guidelines from lessons learned in previous sessions. I periodically ask the agent to update it when we identify successful patterns or I have a novel experience.

I start my planning by describing the high level ideas and any details I've already noted, finishing with ""what do you think of this? let me know if you have any questions or suggestions""

next we iterate over the plan with more detail, identifying specific files, functions, modules etc by name. if the agent is vague, I dig in with ""in point X, what are you going to do specifically?"" if they're weak.

Usually 1-3 cycles of this and we're ready to code. Agents do 100% of the work and I provide testing and UI guidance. For the most part, they were successful on the first pass, and when they weren't only needed minor guidance or clarification to correct. Claude also pulled off a fairly big (imho) refactor and modularization project with only one small UI error.

I know a lot of people like to poopoo AI for what it doesn't (yet) do well, but I'm constantly in awe of how capable these tools are.

1ovpp6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ovpp6h/the_highway_recorder/,The Highway Recorder,"I bought the dashcam at a rest stop somewhere in Nebraska. Two in the morning, fluorescent lights humming overhead, the kind of place where the coffee burns your throat and tastes like chemicals. I’d been driving for sixteen hours straight, hauling machine parts from Toledo to Sacramento, and my eyes felt like they’d been rubbed with sandpaper.

The cashier was a kid with acne scars and bloodshot eyes. Travis, according to his name tag. He was scrolling through his phone with the blank expression of someone who’d given up on sleep years ago.

I grabbed a sandwich from the cooler, a bag of chips, something with enough salt and preservatives to keep me awake another four hours. That’s when I noticed the dashcam sitting on the counter in a clear plastic bag. Older model, boxy, cracked lens cover. Cords tangled around it like dead vines.

How much? I asked.

Twenty bucks, Travis said without looking up. Works fine.

I should have asked why he was selling it. Should have wondered what kind of person unloads a dashcam at a gas station in the middle of the night. But I was three days into a cross-country haul, running on four hours of sleep and truck stop stimulants, and twenty dollars was cheap insurance against the kind of fraud I’d been hearing about from other drivers. Rear-end collisions blamed on the trucker. Pedestrians throwing themselves in front of rigs for settlement money.

I paid, stuffed the camera into my jacket, and walked back out into the cold.

The parking lot was nearly empty at this hour, just a handful of semis scattered across the cracked asphalt like sleeping giants. The wind cut across the open space, carrying the smell of diesel and wet pavement. My truck sat at the far end, running lights glowing amber in the darkness, engine still idling to keep the cab warm. I’d left it running out of habit, the way you leave a porch light on when you live alone.

The truck was a ten-year-old Peterbilt 579, diesel and stale food smell baked into the upholstery. It wasn’t much, but it was mine, bought with a loan I’d be paying off for another three years. The sleeper cab had carried me across more miles than I cared to count, from coast to coast and back again, a rolling home that smelled like rubber and exhaust.

I climbed in, tossed the sandwich onto the passenger seat, and pulled the dashcam from my pocket. No instruction manual, just a suction cup mount and a single button on the side. I pressed it. A red LED blinked to life.

I stuck it to the windshield above the rearview mirror, plugged the cord into the cigarette lighter. The screen flickered, showed a grainy image of the parking lot, then went dark. Good enough.

I fired up the engine, felt the cab shudder as the diesel turned over, and pulled back onto the interstate. The white lines began their endless blur beneath my headlights.

Three days passed. Omaha to Boise with machine parts, then a pickup of canned goods heading east. The rhythm of long-haul trucking settled over me like a familiar blanket, both comforting and suffocating. Truck stop coffee that tasted like battery acid, static-filled AM radio stations fading in and out as I crossed state lines. Talk radio hosts ranting about politics I didn’t care about, country songs about lost loves and open roads, advertisements for lawyers who specialized in accident claims.

I ate most of my meals behind the wheel, one hand on the steering wheel while the other unwrapped gas station sandwiches or shoveled cold french fries into my mouth. I pissed in bottles when the next rest stop was too far away. I showered every third day at truck stops that charged ten dollars for five minutes of lukewarm water. The hours bled together into a gray soup of highway and rest stops, days measured in miles instead of time, my life reduced to the view through a windshield and the sound of tires on asphalt.

The camera blinked red on my windshield, and I forgot it was there.

Then outside Salt Lake City, a sedan swerved into my lane without signaling. I nearly clipped it, felt the Peterbilt lurch as I yanked the wheel. That night, parked at a rest area under a flickering streetlight, I remembered I could check the footage. Evidence, just in case the sedan driver decided to file a false claim.

I dug the memory card from the camera, booted up my laptop from behind the passenger seat, and waited for the files to load. There were a dozen video clips, each timestamped. I found the one from earlier that day and hit play.

Grainy afternoon sun. The sedan drifting into frame. My voice muttering a curse. Perfect. I was about to eject the card when I noticed something wrong.

The folder showed files going back two weeks. I’d only owned the camera for three days.

A chill crawled up my spine. I clicked on one of the older videos, dated ten days before I’d bought the device. The footage showed my truck. Same dashboard, same air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror, same coffee-stained cup holder. But the angle was from the passenger seat, looking across the cab at me behind the wheel. My hand on the gearshift, eyes on the road, completely unaware I was being filmed.

The camera was mounted on the windshield. It couldn’t record from the passenger seat. It was physically impossible.

A chill crawled up my spine, slow and deliberate, like cold fingers walking up my vertebrae. I felt my scalp tighten, felt the hair on my arms stand up beneath my jacket sleeves. My mouth had gone dry. I swallowed, but it didn’t help. The saliva tasted metallic, like fear has a flavor.

I checked another file. This one showed the exterior of my truck, filmed from outside the windshield looking in. I could see myself through the glass, face slack, eyes half-closed, fighting sleep in the dark. The footage shook slightly, unsteady, like it was handheld. But there was no one holding it. Just me, alone in the cab, driving through empty night.

I closed the laptop. My hands were shaking. The cab suddenly felt smaller, the air thicker, like the walls were pressing in. I told myself it was a glitch, corrupted files from a previous owner that hadn’t been properly erased. Cameras malfunction all the time. Memory cards degrade. Data gets corrupted. Cross-contamination between files, maybe, or some weird artifact of how the device stored footage. There had to be a rational explanation, something technical I didn’t understand because I wasn’t an engineer or a computer expert.

But even as I tried to convince myself, I knew I was lying. Deep down, in that animal part of the brain that recognizes danger before the conscious mind catches up, I knew something was wrong with that camera. Something fundamental and impossible and deeply, terribly wrong.

But I couldn’t shake the image of myself being filmed from angles that didn’t exist. Couldn’t stop thinking about that footage of the passenger seat, of the view through the windshield from outside, of myself sleeping unaware while something watched and recorded.

I pulled back onto the highway and tried to ignore the blinking red light above me. The road stretched empty ahead, just white lines and darkness and the occasional semi hauling through the night. By morning, when the sun came up and turned the sky the color of rust, I’d almost convinced myself I’d imagined it.

Almost.

Four days later, parked at a weigh station outside Cheyenne while I waited for my logbook inspection to clear, I decided to check the footage again. I told myself I just needed to see normal recordings, proof that the previous files had been a fluke. But when I opened the folder, there were new files. Dozens of them. All dated within the last four days.

The most recent showed my truck from an overhead angle, as though the camera was mounted on the ceiling of the cab. But it was still on the windshield. I could see it in the frame, red LED blinking in the lower corner like a tiny eye.

I watched myself sleep in the bunk behind the driver’s seat, curled on my side, one arm draped over the mattress edge. The angle shifted slowly, deliberately, panning across the cab like a surveillance camera. It lingered on my face. Zoomed in slightly, close enough that I could see the stubble on my jaw, the way my eyelids twitched during REM sleep. Then it pulled back.

No sound except the faint hum of static. But I could feel it watching. Studying me like a specimen under glass.

I ejected the memory card and held it in my palm. It was warm, warmer than it should have been, almost hot to the touch. Like it had been running a processor at full capacity.

I thought about throwing the whole camera away. Smashing it against the pavement and walking away. Instead, I slid the card back into the slot, closed the laptop, and sat there in the cab, staring at the red light on my windshield, trying to understand what it wanted from me.

A week later, I found footage dated three days in the future.

I stared at the timestamp, certain I’d misread it. But the numbers didn’t change. Three days from now. I recognized the road in the clip immediately, a lonely two-lane route through the Nevada desert I was scheduled to drive later that week. In the footage, I was gripping the wheel with both hands, shoulders tense, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror every few seconds like I was expecting something to appear behind me.

I watched myself reach for the radio, twist the dial through static, then glance out the side window at the empty desert rolling past. Thirty seconds of footage, then it cut to black, replaced by crackling static.

The camera was recording things that hadn’t happened yet. Events that existed only as future possibilities, somehow captured and stored on a memory chip.

I didn’t tell anyone. Didn’t call a friend or a mechanic or anyone who might have an explanation. Because what would I say? That my dashcam could see the future? They’d think I’d been on the road too long, that the isolation and sleepless nights had finally broken something in my head.

So I kept driving. Kept the footage to myself. And when the day came, three days later, I drove that Nevada highway and lived out the scene exactly as I’d watched it. Every movement identical. The way I gripped the wheel with both hands. The way I reached for the radio and heard nothing but static. The way I glanced out the window at the exact moment a vulture circled overhead.

It was like I was following a script written by someone else.

That night, when I checked the footage, I found the same clip recorded again. Same highway, same thirty seconds, same movements. But this time filmed from outside the truck, looking in through the driver’s side window. The perspective was impossible, hovering in mid-air beside my door as I drove seventy miles an hour down an empty road.

I watched myself grip the wheel, reach for the radio, glance at the mirror.

And I watched something else.

A shadow in the passenger seat. Faint, barely visible against the gray interior fabric, like a smudge of darkness that didn’t quite belong. But it was there, shifting slightly, adjusting its position as though trying to get comfortable.

I rewound the footage and watched again. The shadow moved. Independently. Separate from any trick of light or reflection.

I hadn’t been alone in the truck that day.

For the next seventy-two hours, I barely slept. Couldn’t. Every time I tried to close my eyes in the bunk, I’d see that shadow in the passenger seat, shifting and adjusting like it was settling in for a long drive. I’d imagine I could feel it there even now, sitting beside me in the darkness, watching me with eyes I couldn’t see.

I started talking to myself just to fill the silence. Narrating my own actions like a sports commentator. Now I’m checking the mirrors. Now I’m adjusting my speed. Now I’m taking this exit for fuel. Anything to prove I was still in control, still the one making decisions, still autonomous and real and not just some puppet being filmed by an invisible audience.

The isolation got worse. Long-haul trucking is lonely by nature, but this was different. This was the loneliness of being observed without being seen. The kind of isolation that comes from knowing you’re never truly alone, that something is always watching, always recording, always there in your blind spot.

I stopped using the bunk entirely. Started pulling twenty-hour shifts behind the wheel, downing energy drinks until my hands shook and my vision blurred at the edges. Better to stay awake than risk what the camera might show me while I slept. Better to keep moving than give it time to record me at rest, vulnerable, unaware.

Other truckers started giving me weird looks at the truck stops. I caught my reflection in a bathroom mirror one morning and understood why. Bloodshot eyes with dark circles underneath like bruises. Three days of stubble. Hair greasy and unwashed. The look of a man coming apart at the seams.

But I couldn’t stop checking the footage. Every night, I’d review what the camera had captured, scrolling through clip after clip, trying to find a pattern, trying to understand the rules of whatever game I’d stumbled into. The camera recorded constantly, capturing angles that defied every law of physics I understood. One clip showed me from inside my own skull, the dashboard warping and bending through what looked like a fisheye lens embedded directly in my brain. Another showed the highway from hundreds of feet above, my truck reduced to a tiny speck crawling across vast desert emptiness.

I stopped sleeping. The bunk felt exposed, vulnerable, like I was lying on a stage beneath invisible spotlights. I’d lie there with my eyes open, staring at the ceiling, listening to the engine’s constant hum and the creak of the suspension over rough pavement. Every time I closed my eyes, the footage played on a loop inside my head. All those impossible angles, all those perspectives that shouldn’t exist.

The camera wasn’t just recording anymore. It was predicting. Showing me moments of danger before they happened, like warnings from some mechanical oracle. A blown tire on a mountain pass, captured two days before the blowout. A drunk driver swerving into my lane, filmed from an angle that showed his face through his windshield before I’d even seen his headlights. Black ice on a Montana bridge, the footage showing my truck starting to fishtail before I’d reached that section of road.

I started using the predictions as a guide. If the camera showed me swerving left, I’d swerve at that exact spot and find a pothole that would have shredded my tire. If it showed me braking hard, I’d slow down and watch a deer bolt across the highway exactly where I would have been. It worked. Every time. I avoided accidents, sidestepped disasters, stayed one step ahead of the road’s casual brutality.

But the cost was measurable in sleepless nights and frayed nerves. Because the angles grew more invasive with every passing day. Clips filmed from behind my eyes, showing the dashboard from inside my own vision. Footage from inside my chest cavity, my heartbeat visible as a pulsing red glow. Perspectives that made my hands shake and my stomach turn, that made me question whether I was still the one in control of my own body.

The camera was burrowing deeper, peeling back layers of reality like skin from an onion, trying to get at something underneath.

Then I found the final recording.

Dated exactly one week ahead. Thursday night, 11:47 PM. The footage showed my truck on a Montana highway I recognized immediately, a long desolate road through the badlands where cell service died and the only lights were stars. I was driving, both hands white-knuckled on the wheel, face pale and drawn in the dashboard’s green glow.

I watched myself glance at the rearview mirror. My eyes were wide, pupils blown huge like I’d seen something terrible. The truck drifted left, crossed the faded yellow center line, then jerked back with an overcorrection that made the whole rig shudder. I reached for the radio with one trembling hand, twisted the dial frantically through nothing but static. Then I looked out the side window, and my mouth opened like I was screaming, but there was no sound in the footage.

The clip cut abruptly to a new angle. From somewhere impossibly high above, looking straight down at the highway like footage from a satellite or drone. I watched the Peterbilt drift again, this time all the way across the center line into the opposite lane. No other traffic anywhere, no headlights in either direction, just my truck swerving wildly as though I’d lost all control.

The camera zoomed in slowly, deliberately, focusing on the cab. Through the windshield I could see myself slumped forward over the wheel, head lolling to one side, arms hanging limp. The truck veered right, left the pavement, hit the gravel shoulder in a spray of dust and stones. Then it began to roll.

Once. The world inverting, windows shattering into diamonds of glass.

Twice. Metal screaming as the cab crumpled, the trailer jackknifing behind.

Three times. A slow-motion collapse of everything I owned, everything I was, turning into twisted wreckage.

The footage ended with the truck on its side in the ditch, wheels still spinning uselessly in the air, steam or smoke rising from the crumpled hood in pale streamers. Then the screen went black.

I sat there in my parked truck, staring at the laptop screen, feeling my heart slam against my ribs hard enough to hurt. My mouth had gone completely dry. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the laptop steady.

The camera had just shown me my own death. In perfect detail. From multiple impossible angles.

I checked the timestamp three more times, hoping I’d misread it. But the numbers stayed the same. Thursday, one week from tonight. 11:47 PM. I had a delivery scheduled through that exact area, industrial equipment heading to a fabrication plant outside Billings. The route dispatcher had given me would take me through the Montana badlands on Thursday night, along that precise stretch of highway.

I could change the route. I told myself that for six straight days. I spent those days trying every angle I could think of.

I called dispatch, claimed I was having mechanical trouble. They rerouted me through Wyoming instead. But then the Wyoming route got shut down due to a wildfire, and dispatch put me back on the Montana highway.

I had the brakes professionally inspected. They were fine. I replaced all four tires even though they had another ten thousand miles on them. I caught up on sleep, ate decent meals instead of gas station junk, made sure I was rested and alert and thinking clearly.

But none of it mattered. A detour here, a last-minute schedule change there, a series of small decisions and circumstances I couldn’t predict or control. All of it herding me back toward that moment, correcting my course every single time I tried to deviate. It was like the universe itself was conspiring to put me on that highway at that exact time, ensuring the footage would come true.

By Wednesday night, I’d given up trying to fight it. I accepted the inevitable. I reached the Montana badlands just before midnight, the road empty and dark under a sliver of moon that barely lit the asphalt. I checked the dashboard clock as I drove.

11:42 PM.

Five minutes.

I thought about stopping. Pulling over right now, getting out, walking away into the desert and letting whatever was going to happen happen without me inside the truck. But my hands stayed locked on the wheel. My foot stayed steady on the accelerator. The camera kept blinking its red eye above me, patient and inevitable.

11:44 PM.

Three minutes. My heart was hammering. Sweat ran down my back despite the cold air blowing from the vents. The highway stretched ahead into darkness, empty except for the white lines marking the center. No other vehicles. No lights. Just me and the road and the approaching moment.

11:45 PM.

I glanced at the rearview mirror, exactly as I had in the footage. My eyes were wide, pupils dilated with adrenaline. I looked terrified. I looked like a man staring at his own grave. My hand reached for the radio without conscious thought, muscle memory following the script. I twisted the dial.

Static erupted from the speakers, a hissing crackling roar that made my teeth ache and my skull hurt. It filled the cab completely, drowning out even the rumble of the diesel engine. The sound was wrong, somehow. Not like normal radio static. More organic. More alive. Like something breathing, or screaming, or trying to communicate in a language made of white noise and interference.

And in that moment, surrounded by that shrieking emptiness, with my hands locked on the wheel and my foot pressed to the accelerator and the dashboard clock glowing 11:45 PM, I understood.

I understood everything.

The camera hadn’t shown me the crash from multiple angles by accident. Every impossible perspective, every angle that defied the laws of space and time and physics, was a thread. A connection. A command. The device wasn’t just predicting my future or documenting my present. It was writing it. Constructing reality frame by frame, angle by angle, weaving me into a narrative I couldn’t escape because I was already living inside it.

Every clip I’d watched had been a blueprint. Instructions. A script for a play I didn’t know I was performing. And I’d followed them all. Every swerve to avoid the pothole. Every brake before the drunk driver appeared. Every movement captured in future footage that I then lived out precisely, thinking I was avoiding danger when really I was just confirming the camera’s predictions, making them real, completing the loop.

The camera wasn’t showing me what would happen. It was showing me what I would do. What I had to do. Because I’d already seen it, and seeing it made it inevitable.

I was trapped in a causal loop of my own observation.

11:47 PM.

I yanked the wheel hard to the right. The truck lurched violently, tires shrieking against asphalt, the whole rig shuddering as it fought against momentum and inertia. I slammed both feet on the brake pedal, felt the anti-lock system stutter and pulse beneath my heel. The cab fishtailed, the trailer trying to swing around and jackknife.

The dashboard clock glowed green in the chaos.

11:47 PM.

The exact moment. The exact time I was supposed to lose control and die.

But I didn’t.

The truck bucked and shuddered and finally came to a stop on the shoulder, half on gravel, half on dirt. I threw the gearshift into park with hands that wouldn’t stop shaking. Sat there in the sudden silence, chest heaving, heart slamming, alive.

The camera blinked above me. Red LED pulsing in the darkness. And for the first time since I’d bought the device, I felt like it was actually looking at me. Not recording. Not predicting. Just staring. Considering. Recalculating.

I got out of the truck. My legs nearly gave out when my boots hit the ground. The night air was brutally cold, sharp enough to cut through my jacket and jeans like they weren’t there. My breath came out in ragged clouds. I walked around to the passenger side on legs that felt made of water, opened the door, and reached for the camera.

My hand hovered over the suction cup mount. All I had to do was pull. Rip the device free, throw it into the darkness beyond the shoulder, and drive away. Start over. Forget any of this had happened.

But standing there in the freezing dark, listening to the wind whistle across the empty badlands, I realized something that made my blood turn cold.

It was too late.

The camera had already recorded this moment. Me, standing outside the truck in the middle of the night, hand reaching for the mount but not quite touching it. Me, hesitating. Me, realizing the futility. Me, walking away without destroying the thing that had tried to kill me.

It had seen all of this coming. Predicted my escape, my survival, my moment of defiance. Which meant it had already moved past this. Already recorded what came next. Already woven me into whatever narrative followed.

I was still in its story. I’d never stopped being in its story.

I climbed back into the cab, hands numb, and started the engine. Not toward Billings. Not toward the fabrication plant or the delivery or any obligation I’d had before tonight. I turned the truck around and drove in the opposite direction, putting miles between myself and that stretch of highway as fast as the Peterbilt would carry me.

I drove until I reached a truck stop outside Bozeman, just as the sun was starting to paint the eastern sky pale orange. I parked in the back lot, grabbed my duffel bag with my clothes and wallet and nothing else, and walked away from the truck without looking back.

The camera stayed on the windshield, suction cup still firmly attached, red LED still blinking into the empty cab. Let it record whatever it wanted to record. Let it document the empty driver’s seat and the dashboard and the abandoned controls. I was done being its subject.

I spent three weeks in a cheap motel outside Bozeman, paying cash daily, keeping my head down and the curtains drawn. I ignored the increasingly angry calls from dispatch, ignored the mounting penalties and breach-of-contract fees for the abandoned delivery. None of it mattered anymore. I had bigger problems than money or reputation.

Every night I closed my eyes and saw that footage. Saw myself slumped over the wheel, the truck rolling, the metal crumpling like paper. Saw all those impossible angles, all those perspectives that documented my death from places a camera couldn’t reach. The images were burned into my brain, permanent as scars.

Eventually, I got a call from a salvage yard in Butte. They’d found my truck at a state auction, bought it cheap, and were prepping it for resale. Did I want to pick up any personal belongings I’d left in the cab? Tools, clothes, anything valuable?

I told them no. Told them to junk the whole rig, camera and all, crush it into a cube and be done with it.

But they didn’t.

A week later, scrolling through a trucker forum on a library computer, I saw a post that made my stomach drop. Someone had bought a used Peterbilt at auction, great condition, barely any miles, amazing deal. And it came with a dashcam already installed, the new owner wrote. Camera works perfectly. Already started using it to document my routes. Best twenty bucks the previous owner ever spent.

I stared at the screen for a long time. I wanted to reply, to send a private message, to warn them about what that camera really was and what it would do to them. But what would I say? That the dashcam records the future? That it films you from angles that don’t exist? That it would show them their own death and then make sure it happened?

They’d think I was insane. Report me. Block me. And maybe they’d be right. Maybe I was insane. Maybe I’d been on the road too long and something in my head had finally snapped.

But I didn’t think so.

I never went back to trucking. Found a job at a distribution warehouse on the outskirts of Missoula, loading freight onto pallets, driving a forklift, doing the kind of mindless physical work where you don’t have to think or make decisions or be responsible for anything more complicated than moving boxes from point A to point B.

I kept my head down. Avoided cameras. Avoided mirrors when I could. Took side streets instead of highways, walked instead of driving, tried to stay out of any space where I might be recorded.

Because every now and then, I’d catch my reflection in a storefront window or a piece of glass, and the angle would be wrong.

Just slightly off. Just enough to notice if you were paying attention.

Like I was being viewed from somewhere to my left, or my right, or from above, instead of straight-on the way reflections are supposed to work. Like there was a lens somewhere I couldn’t see, still documenting, still recording, still building its narrative frame by frame.

And I’d wonder if the camera was still out there. If somewhere in some other trucker’s cab, in some other truck rolling down some other highway, there was footage of me right now. Me standing here on this street corner in Missoula. Me staring at my own wrong-angled reflection. Me realizing that I’d never really escaped at all.

That I was still in the story. Still being recorded. Still following a script I couldn’t see.

And maybe, somewhere in those files, there was footage of what came next. Of how my story ended. Of the moment when I finally stopped running and the camera caught up with me.

Maybe it had already recorded my last day.

Maybe it was just waiting for me to live it.

I matched with a few guys who wanted to meet later in the week, but that wouldn’t work for me. I needed it now and I was flying out soon, so there wouldn’t be enough time.

Then I matched with this one guy I’m pretty sure I even superliked because he was exactly my type. Tall as fuck. Great body. Loved pets. Same values. Wanted fun, intimacy, no commitment. Perfect. I told him, let’s meet tonight — and we did. We went to an arcade bar, had drinks, food, and played games. The conversation flowed easily, at least for me. After a short walk, we went to his car to “warm up”, and I knew what I was there for. We made out for a bit and I told him I wasn’t doing it in his car, we should go to his place instead. He said he lived an hour away and asked if that was okay. I said fuck yeah. So sleeping over was clearly on the table. I asked if he was fine with it, and he said yes.

We were playful the whole time. I even joked about him murdering me, but I had the advantage because no one knew who he was with. He told me to text my sister his address. He even showed me his driver’s licence before that, so I wasn’t worried.

We got to his place, he showed me around, and then we did the deed. It was insane — the best sex I’ve ever had. Everything just worked. He was big, strong, confident, all the spots were hit, the dirty talk was on point — everything.

The next morning, he made me breakfast. We cuddled, watched a film, napped, smoked, cuddled again. We were glued to each other. Skin always touching. Sniffing each other. Making out for long stretches even without having sex. Then sex again. And again. It felt like every 30 minutes.

He drove me home after, bought me Starbucks on the way, and we held hands the whole drive. I took over his phone’s Spotify and he didn’t mind at all.

He wanted to see me again that same night, so I Uber’d an hour to him. I brought him snacks from my culture we talked about, plus a spare hand cream since we’d joked about his dry hands. He seemed to like the gesture — he kept the hand cream in his car and I watched him use it constantly.

We watched Netflix, had more sex, and talked deeply about everything — family, grief, dogs, work, life. Then more sex. The next morning, I worked while he slept, then he woke up, made me coffee, and we went right back to cuddling and having sex again.

Three days before I had to leave, he said he wanted to take me out to dinner before I flew home. After work, he took me to a bar near my place. And this is where everything gets confusing.

He regularly talked about wanting to visit me in my home country. That night, he pinky-promised he’d visit in February. I didn’t care if this was just sex or him lovebombing — but I didn’t realise this was part of the game. He didn’t have to say any of that or make me hopeful. I knew we were both there for sex and intimacy for a short time. He could’ve just stopped.

But he kept going. He told me I was the girl of his dreams. That if it weren’t for the distance, he’d pursue me. That I was amazing. And sure, fine, but he didn’t need to pile it on. He even brought up FaceTiming after work once I got home so we could catch up. I DIDN’T ASK FOR THAT. None of it was me initiating — it was him saying all of it.

After dinner, we had a great night. We took pictures together — he suggested it and said he wanted “cute photos” from our last night. The next day, we were still talking. Even on the day I flew out, he was messaging me at the airport telling me to text him on my layover because he’d be awake. So I did, because I thought he meant it.

Since landing back home on Monday, it’s been radio silence. Nothing. He even posted on Instagram six hours ago but didn’t bother replying to me. This same guy who said “you have my word”, who said he’d book a one-way flight in November, who said he’d come see how long he could stay.

This is my first time being ghosted. I’ve hooked up before, but hookups never hurt because I knew my boundaries. I kept conversations shallow and didn’t let myself get comfortable. But this one made me let my guard down because I thought he was genuinely into me. Turns out, he was just better at the game. And I got played.

I’m so hurt. And as much as I want to double text and ask why, I know I shouldn’t.",4,1763002076.0,offmychest,0,0.84,False

Proof: 142
Age: 7 years
Mashbill: 100% corn
Price: $140 (South Carolina, 2025)

Distilled and aged in Richmond, Virginia by Reservoir Distillery. Aged in alligator char, 5 gallon barrels (this is a 3 barrel blend).

Rested for 20 minutes.

Nose: Heavy barrel char, jammy blackberries, burnt caramel, buttered popcorn and roasted nuts. Subtle vanilla buttercream peaks out from the darkness.

7/10

Taste: Front of the palate is set ablaze with every sip. Intense cinnamon candies (Atomic Fireballs), dark jammy blackberries. Dark chocolate, almost a dark roast coffee at times.

7/10

Finish: Long. The cinnamon candies from the palate linger for quite awhile. Touch of mocha.

7/10

Verdict: 7/10

This is one of those whiskeys that is just a wild ride from start to finish. While the proof was clearly the selling point, I think it’s also ultimately the main thing holding it back. I sat with this pour for well over an hour and didn’t feel like I had really established any concrete notes in that time.

This idea was reinforced when I added a splash of water to the last 1/4oz in my glass. The immediate singe when attempting to nose was gone and the front of the palate no longer set ablaze with every sip. It’s still aggressive, but slightly more approachable.

Of all the ‘hazmat’ whiskeys I own, this is my least favorite. It feels like a perfect example of just because it can be 140+ proof, doesn’t mean it should.",11,1763002035.0,bourbon,2,0.93,False

I’ve been a paramedic for seven years. Seven years of graveyard shifts, and I can tell you that working nights changes you. It has to.

You see things in the dark that daylight has the decency to hide. You learn a town by its emergencies, its accidents, its moments when everything goes wrong. You know which intersections are hungry. Which houses keep calling you back. Which roads seem cursed by something more than bad luck.

The job gets in your blood. It becomes part of you. You start measuring time in shifts instead of days. Start judging the severity of situations before you even arrive. Start knowing, just by the sound of a dispatcher’s voice, whether you’re about to save a life or bag a body.

You develop instincts. Gut feelings. The kind that tell you when something’s wrong before your conscious mind catches up. When to push harder on compressions. When to call for backup. When to take the long way because the shortcut’s going to cost you time you don’t have.

I know every road in my territory. Every turn, every pothole, every place where the asphalt gives way to gravel and hope. I know which bridges flood in spring. Which farmhouses keep vicious dogs. Which gas stations have the cleanest bathrooms at three in the morning.

I know where the cell signal dies. Where the GPS gets confused. Where the locals still give directions by landmarks that haven’t existed in twenty years.

Except one.

I’d never heard of Old Miller Road.

I’d never heard of Old Miller Road until three weeks ago. That’s the thing that bothers me most. In seven years, covering forty miles of rural territory outside Ashford, I’d never once heard that name. Not from dispatch, not from other medics, not from the old timers who’ve been doing this since before I was born.

My name is Jake Hendricks. I work for County Medical Services. Population out here is maybe eight thousand if you count the farms. It’s the kind of place where the same families have lived for generations. Where roads still have names like “The Hutchins Place” even though the Hutchins moved away in ’87. Where everyone knows everyone, and nothing stays secret for long.

So how did I miss an entire road?

The calls started on a Tuesday. I was parked outside the 24-hour gas station on Route 9. The only place with decent coffee at two in the morning. My partner Marcus was inside getting us refills. The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a possible 10-50 with injuries, Old Miller Road, approximately two miles east of the junction.”

I grabbed the radio. “Dispatch, Unit Seven. Can you repeat that location?”

“Old Miller Road, two miles east of junction. Caller reports single vehicle accident, driver may be unconscious.”

“Dispatch, I’m not familiar with Old Miller Road. Can you provide cross streets or GPS coordinates?”

Silence. Long silence. Just that particular hiss of dead air that makes you think something’s gone wrong with the equipment.

“Unit Seven, stand by.”

Marcus climbed back in, handed me a coffee. Black, two sugars, the way I always take it. He saw my face.

“What’s wrong?”

“Dispatch has a call on Old Miller Road. Ever heard of it?”

He frowned. Took a sip. Shook his head. “No. That’s in our territory?”

“Apparently.”

Marcus had been my partner for three years. We’d worked together long enough that we could communicate without words. Long enough that I knew his ex-wife’s name and he knew about my father’s heart condition. Long enough that I trusted him with my life, and he trusted me with his.

We’d seen bad things together. The kind of things that stick with you. A teenager who’d wrapped his car around a telephone pole doing ninety. A grandmother who’d fallen down the stairs and laid there for three days before anyone found her. A construction worker who’d been crushed by equipment, still conscious, still talking, knowing he was dying and there wasn’t a damn thing we could do about it.

Those calls bond you. Make you family in a way most people never understand.

So when Marcus looked concerned, I paid attention.

The radio crackled again. “Unit Seven, dispatch. We’re having trouble pulling up that location. Stand by for GPS coordinates.”

More silence. The kind that feels heavy, wrong.

“Unit Seven, we’re unable to verify the location at this time. Caller disconnected. We’ll attempt a callback and get you more information. Disregard for now.”

Marcus shrugged. “Probably a prank. You know how kids get.”

I nodded. But something about it sat wrong in my stomach. Dispatch doesn’t usually put calls through without verifying location first. And the dispatcher’s voice, that uncertainty, it wasn’t normal. These people were professionals. They knew the territory as well as I did.

Better, even.

We finished our coffee. The rest of the shift was routine. A drunk college kid with a busted nose from a bar fight. An elderly woman with chest pains that turned out to be heartburn. Normal Tuesday night stuff.

I forgot about Old Miller Road.

Until three nights later.

I was parked outside the hospital, finishing paperwork from a transfer. Marcus was inside, flirting with one of the night nurses. The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50 with possible entrapment, Old Miller Road, approximately three miles north of the county line.”

My hand was on the radio before the dispatcher finished talking.

“Dispatch, Unit Seven. I need clarification on that location. We received a similar call earlier this week and couldn’t verify the road.”

“Unit Seven, caller states Old Miller Road, three miles north of county line. Reporting a vehicle that appears to have left the roadway.”

“Dispatch, can you provide GPS coordinates? I don’t have that road on any of my maps.”

Static. That same dead air I’d heard before.

“Unit Seven, GPS system is showing… Stand by.”

I waited. My fingers were tight around the radio. Something about this call felt wrong in a way I couldn’t name. It was like hearing a word you know is misspelled but can’t figure out how.

“Unit Seven, we’re unable to pull coordinates. The system keeps showing an error. We’re attempting to recontact the caller now.”

“Dispatch, who called it in? Is it the same number as the first call?”

A pause. Longer than it should have been.

“Negative, Unit Seven. Different caller. Different number. But caller disconnected before we could get additional information.”

I stared out the windshield at the hospital parking lot. The sodium lights turned everything orange and sickly. My reflection looked back at me from the glass, and for just a moment, I didn’t recognize my own face.

“Dispatch, any other information on the vehicle or caller?”

“Negative, Unit Seven. We’ll keep trying. Stand by.”

The callback never came.

Marcus got back twenty minutes later, grinning because he’d gotten the nurse’s number. I told him about the call. The grin faded fast.

“That’s weird,” he said. “Same road?”

“Same road. Different location. Different caller.”

“You ask the old timers about it?”

I hadn’t. But before our next shift, I did.

Roy Hutchins was in the break room. Roy had been with County Medical for thirty-two years. He knew every road, every farm, every family in the territory. If anyone would know about Old Miller Road, it’d be Roy.

“Roy, you ever heard of a road called Old Miller Road?”

He looked up from his newspaper. His weathered face creased as he frowned. “Old Miller Road?”

“Yeah. I’ve had a couple calls come through dispatch for it, but I can’t find it on any map. Dispatch can’t pull it up either.”

The color drained from his face. It happened so fast, so completely, that for a second I thought he was having a stroke. Then he folded his newspaper very carefully. Set it down on the table. Looked at me with eyes that were suddenly very serious.

“Don’t go looking for that road, Jake.”

“What? Why not?”

“Just don’t. You hear a call come through for Old Miller Road, you tell dispatch you can’t locate it. You understand me?”

“Roy, what the hell are you talking about?”

He stood up. Grabbed his coffee cup. Walked toward the door. Then he stopped, his back to me, his hand on the doorframe.

“There are some roads that don’t want to be found, son. And there are some calls you shouldn’t answer.”

He left me sitting there. Confused and more unsettled than I wanted to admit.

The calls kept coming.

Two more over the next week. Same pattern. Old Miller Road, different locations, different callers who disconnected before providing details. Dispatch unable to verify, GPS showing errors, no coordinates available.

Each call felt like a hook in my chest, pulling me toward something I couldn’t see.

I started asking around. Other paramedics, other dispatchers. Most had never heard of the road. A few reacted like Roy had. That same draining of color. That same warning to let it go.

One of the dispatchers, an older woman named Carol who’d been with the county for twenty years, actually hung up on me when I mentioned it. Just clicked off mid-conversation. When I called back, she said she had another call coming in and couldn’t talk.

But her voice had been shaking.

I couldn’t let it go.

I started digging. County records, old maps, historical archives at the library. I spent my days off, the hours I should have been sleeping, poring through documents. Property deeds, surveyor’s reports, highway department documents.

My girlfriend at the time, Sarah, thought I was losing it. She’d find me at two in the afternoon, after a twelve-hour shift, still awake, still searching through old records on my laptop.

“Jake, you need to sleep,” she’d say. “You’re going to burn out.”

But I couldn’t explain to her what I was feeling. This compulsion. This need to understand. It was like having a word on the tip of your tongue, just out of reach, driving you crazy.

I found nothing. Old Miller Road didn’t exist, not officially. Not on any map printed after 1962.

But I found something else.

In a box of old newspaper clippings from 1963, there was an article about a road closure. Small article, buried on page six, dated September 14th. Miller Road was being permanently closed due to safety concerns. The county had determined the road was too dangerous, too prone to accidents.

Seven fatal crashes in three years. Seven people dead on a five-mile stretch of rural road.

I read the names of the victims. Sarah Chen, 23. Michael Brenner, 45. Patricia Goode and her daughter Jessica, 8. Thomas Walsh, 67. David and Jennifer Martinez, both 31.

All of them dead. All of them on the same road.

The article said the road would be barricaded. New routes would be established. The name would be removed from official maps. There was a quote from the county supervisor saying it was the only responsible choice.

It didn’t say why seven people had died there. It didn’t say what made the road so dangerous. It didn’t mention if there were any survivors. Any witnesses.

It didn’t say what happened to the road after it was closed.

And it didn’t explain why, sixty years later, dispatch was still getting calls from it.

I showed Marcus the article. He read it twice, handed it back, shook his head.

“So it’s a real road. Or was. Maybe there are still old signs out there. Maybe people still call it by that name.”

“Then why can’t we find it? Why won’t GPS pull it up?”

“I don’t know, man. But Roy’s right. This is starting to feel weird. Maybe we should just drop it.”

I should have listened.

But I didn’t.

Three nights later, just past midnight, the call came.

We were parked at our usual spot near the gas station. Marcus had dozed off in the passenger seat, his head against the window. The night was quiet, moonless, the kind of darkness that feels thick enough to touch.

The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50, possible fatality, Old Miller Road, one quarter mile past the old stone bridge.”

My heart slammed. I grabbed the radio.

“Dispatch, Unit Seven. What stone bridge? I need better directions.”

“Unit Seven, caller states Old Miller Road, one quarter mile past the stone bridge. Reporting a vehicle accident, single occupant, unresponsive.”

“Dispatch, I need GPS coordinates. I don’t know where this road is.”

Static. That familiar, unsettling static.

“Unit Seven, GPS is showing errors again. But the caller provided landmarks. Take Highway 34 north for twelve miles, then turn west on the unmarked road just past the Brennan farm. Follow it for three miles. You’ll see the stone bridge.”

I knew the Brennan farm. Old man Brennan had died last year, but the property was still there. Sprawling fields and outbuildings slowly collapsing into themselves. I’d been out there twice for calls.

But I’d never noticed an unmarked road past it.

“Dispatch, did you get a callback number? Is the caller still on the line?”

“Negative, Unit Seven. Caller disconnected. But they sounded distressed. Said it looked bad.”

Marcus was awake now, listening. He looked at me. I looked at him.

“We going?” he asked.

I should have said no. I should have remembered Roy’s warning. Should have told dispatch we couldn’t locate it. Should have requested another unit.

But I didn’t.

“Yeah,” I said. “We’re going.”

I put the ambulance in gear and pulled onto Highway 34, heading north.

The drive should have taken fifteen minutes. It felt longer. The darkness was absolute, pressing in from all sides. Our headlights carved a tunnel through it, but beyond that tunnel was nothing. No other cars, no houses, no lights anywhere. Just darkness and the white line unwinding endlessly ahead.

The radio played static between us. No music, no chatter, just that low hiss that makes you feel like you’re the last two people alive.

Marcus was quiet. He kept checking his phone, kept looking out the window like he was trying to memorize landmarks. Smart. In case we needed to find our way back.

“This feels wrong,” he said finally.

“I know.”

“We should turn back.”

“I know.”

But I kept driving. My hands were locked on the wheel. My foot steady on the gas. Something was pulling me forward, something stronger than common sense or survival instinct. It felt like being caught in a current. Like drowning in slow motion.

The trees on either side of the highway seemed to lean in closer the further north we went. Their branches reaching over the road like skeletal fingers trying to touch. The pavement beneath us was smooth, recently paved, but the white lines were faded almost to nothing. Like no one had driven this stretch in years.

“How many miles?” Marcus asked.

I checked the odometer. “Eight. Four more to the farm.”

“You sure about this?”

“No.”

He laughed, but there was no humor in it. “Great. That’s real comforting.”

“You didn’t have to come.”

“Yeah, I did. Can’t let you do something stupid alone. That’s what partners do.”

The Brennan farm appeared in our headlights like something from a dream. The old farmhouse dark and leaning, like it was trying to collapse but couldn’t quite commit. The barn partially caved in, its roof sagging under the weight of decay. The fence posts leaned at drunken angles, the wire between them rusted and broken.

Old man Brennan had died of a heart attack in that house. We’d been the ones to respond. Too late, of course. He’d been dead for three days before a neighbor noticed the smell. I remember the flies. The way they buzzed against the windows, angry at being disturbed.

I slowed down, looking for the unmarked road.

And there it was.

I almost missed it. It wasn’t marked, wasn’t paved, was barely even visible. Just a break in the trees, a dirt track leading into the woods. The kind of road you’d drive past a hundred times without noticing.

But there was something about it that made my skin crawl. Something that made every instinct scream at me to keep driving. To not look. To pretend I’d never seen it.

The trees at the entrance were wrong. Their trunks were twisted, bark peeling in long strips. Their branches reached toward each other across the narrow gap, forming a tunnel of skeletal wood.

I turned onto it anyway.

The ambulance bounced and rattled over uneven ground. Tree branches scraped the sides. The headlights showed nothing but trees and dirt and darkness pressing in.

“Jake, I really think we should go back,” Marcus said. His voice was tight.

“Just a little further. If we don’t find anything in the next mile, we’ll turn around.”

I was lying. I wasn’t going to turn around. Something was pulling me forward, something I couldn’t explain or resist. It felt like drowning in slow motion.

“What happens at nightfall?” Marcus asked suddenly.

“What?”

“Earlier. You said we had to do this before nightfall. What happens after dark?”

I didn’t remember saying that. But as soon as he mentioned it, I knew it was true. Something worse happened after dark. Something I couldn’t quite remember but knew with absolute certainty.

The road curved and dipped. Following contours of land that felt wrong. Too steep or too flat or at angles that didn’t make sense. My sense of direction was completely gone. I had no idea if we were heading north or south or sideways into some place that shouldn’t exist.

Then we saw the bridge.

It rose up in our headlights like something from another century. Stone, old and moss-covered, a single arch spanning a creek I couldn’t see the bottom of. The bridge was narrow, barely wide enough for the ambulance. As we crossed it, I heard stones scraping our undercarriage.

On the other side, the road changed.

It was paved now. Smooth and dark, gleaming faintly in our headlights. But the pavement was wrong. It looked ancient, cracked, like it hadn’t been maintained in decades. Yet here it was.

Old Miller Road.

It was real.

“Jesus,” Marcus whispered. “How is this possible?”

I didn’t answer. My hands were white-knuckled on the wheel.

We followed the road for what felt like miles. Time felt strange here, elastic, unreliable. Then, around a curve, we saw it.

The ambulance.

Wrapped around a tree on the right side of the road. Front end crumpled. Hood popped open. Steam or smoke rising from the engine. The lights were still on. All of them. Headlights, emergency lights, everything flashing red and white in the darkness.

And the engine was running. I could hear it from fifty feet away.

Marcus and I looked at each other. He was pale. I probably was too.

I pulled our ambulance to a stop about twenty feet behind the wreck. Put it in park. Grabbed my flashlight. Marcus grabbed the medical kit. We got out.

The night was absolutely silent except for the idling engine. No crickets. No wind. No sound at all. The air smelled wrong. Metallic and sharp, like a storm about to break.

We approached slowly. I played my flashlight over the vehicle.

That’s when I saw it.

The unit number on the side.

Unit Seven.

My unit. Our unit. The same number as the ambulance we’d just driven here.

“Jake,” Marcus said. His voice was shaking. “Jake, that’s—”

“I know.”

But it couldn’t be. It was impossible. We were standing right here. Our ambulance was right behind us, running, undamaged. This had to be different. Maybe an old unit that had been decommissioned. Maybe someone playing a sick joke.

But the number was right there. Unit Seven. And it wasn’t just similar. It was identical. Same decals, same wear patterns, same scratch on the passenger door that Marcus had put there last month backing into a mailbox.

I approached the driver’s side window. It was shattered. Glass covering the seat. I shone my flashlight inside.

The interior was destroyed. Equipment scattered everywhere. Steering wheel bent. Dashboard caved in. The radio was on, crackling with static.

And in that static, I heard something.

A voice.

Distant. Distorted. But definitely a voice.

“…Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50…”

My voice.

The radio was playing our dispatch calls. All of them. Every call from Old Miller Road, one after another, overlapping and distorting. Creating a chorus of my own voice saying the same things over and over.

“…Old Miller Road…”

“…unable to verify location…”

“…caller disconnected…”

I stumbled back from the window. Marcus caught my arm.

“We need to leave,” he said. “Right now. We need to get the hell out of here.”

But I couldn’t move. I was staring at the ambulance. At the blood on the windshield. At the driver’s seat where someone had died.

Where I had died.

The realization hit me like a punch to the chest. This wasn’t someone else’s ambulance. This was mine. This was us. This was what had happened or was going to happen or was happening right now in some other version of reality.

I walked around to the back. The doors were open, swinging slightly in a breeze I couldn’t feel. I looked inside.

The stretcher was deployed. Sheets soaked with blood. Medical equipment scattered everywhere, like someone had been desperately trying to save a life. My clipboard was on the floor, pages covered in my handwriting.

I picked it up. Shone my flashlight on it.

The words made my head spin.

Notes from calls. Patient information, vital signs, treatment protocols. But the dates were wrong. They were all from the future. Next week, next month, next year. Calls I hadn’t responded to yet.

And at the bottom of the last page, in handwriting I didn’t recognize:

“He keeps trying to find the road. He keeps answering the calls. He can’t help himself. He doesn’t understand that the road found him first.”

I dropped the clipboard. Marcus was beside me, looking over my shoulder.

“What does that mean?” he asked.

I didn’t know. But I was starting to understand something terrible.

The calls hadn’t started three weeks ago. They’d been happening forever. Looping endlessly. Pulling me toward this moment. The road hadn’t been closed because of accidents. It had been closed because it was the accident. A place where time folded in on itself. Where cause and effect stopped making sense.

And I’d driven right into it.

“We need to get back to our ambulance,” I said. “Now.”

We turned around.

Our ambulance was gone.

Where we’d parked it, there was nothing. Just empty road and darkness pressing in.

“No,” Marcus said. “No, no, no. It was right there. It was right fucking there.”

I played my flashlight across the road. No tire tracks. No indication we’d ever parked there. It was like the ambulance had never existed.

Or like we’d never driven it here.

I looked back at the wrecked Unit Seven. Still wrapped around the tree. Still running. Still flashing its emergency lights into nothing.

The radio was still crackling.

“…Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50, Old Miller Road…”

My voice. Over and over. Calling myself to my own accident.

“Jake, what’s happening?” Marcus was panicking now, his voice high and tight.

I didn’t answer. I was trying to think, trying to understand, but my thoughts kept slipping away like water through fingers.

The road. The calls. The ambulance. They were all connected. All part of the same loop.

I pulled out my phone. No signal. Of course there was no signal.

“We walk,” I said. “We follow the road back to the highway.”

“Which direction?” Marcus asked.

I pointed back the way we’d come. Toward the stone bridge. But even as I did, I wasn’t sure. The road looked different now. The trees closer. The darkness thicker.

We started walking.

The pavement under our feet felt wrong. Too soft. Too yielding. Like walking on something living. Our footsteps echoed in ways they shouldn’t, bouncing back from distances that couldn’t exist.

Behind us, the wrecked ambulance’s lights kept flashing. Kept calling out to anyone who might pass by. But no one would pass by. No one could find this road unless the road wanted to be found.

We walked for what felt like hours. Time was broken here. I could feel it stretching and compressing. Could feel myself existing in multiple moments at once.

Then we saw them.

Lights ahead. Headlights. Moving toward us.

“Thank God,” Marcus said, starting to run. “Someone’s coming.”

But I knew. Even before the vehicle got close enough to see clearly, I knew.

It was an ambulance. Unit Seven. Our unit.

It was us.

The ambulance drove past without slowing, without seeing us. I caught a glimpse through the windshield as it passed. Marcus in the passenger seat. Me behind the wheel.

Both of us staring straight ahead with expressions of grim determination.

Driving toward the accident we’d just left behind.

Marcus had stopped running. He was staring after the ambulance, watching its taillights disappear around the curve.

“That was us,” he said. “That was us driving here. How is that possible?”

I understood then. The horrible, complete understanding that made everything worse.

We hadn’t found Old Miller Road three weeks ago when the first call came in. We’d been here much longer. We’d been here forever. Driving this same route. Answering this same call. Finding this same accident over and over.

The road was a loop. A trap. And we’d been caught in it so long we’d forgotten we were trapped.

“Marcus,” I said slowly. “When did we start working graveyard shift?”

He looked at me, confused. “What? I don’t know. A few months ago?”

“Think harder. When exactly?”

His face went pale as he tried to remember and couldn’t. “I… I don’t remember. Jesus, Jake, I don’t remember.”

Neither did I. I couldn’t remember anything before the calls started. Couldn’t remember my apartment. My family. My life outside of these endless night shifts and this goddamn road.

Because there was nothing to remember. There hadn’t been a before. There was only this, repeating forever.

We heard the crash then. Metal screaming. Glass shattering. The sound of an engine dying. From around the curve where our other selves had just driven.

“No,” Marcus whispered. “No, we can’t go back there. We can’t look.”

But we had to. We always had to. That was part of the loop.

We walked back. Every step felt heavy, wrong, like walking through mud. The darkness pressed in tighter with each step.

When we rounded the curve, the scene was exactly the same. Unit Seven wrapped around the tree. Emergency lights flashing. Engine running. Radio crackling.

But this time, there were two bodies in the front seats.

I didn’t look at their faces. I couldn’t. But I knew who they were.

Marcus made a sound like a wounded animal. “How do we stop this? How do we get out?”

I didn’t know. Maybe we couldn’t. Maybe this was it, forever. Driving to the accident. Finding ourselves dead. Walking away. Forgetting. Doing it all over again.

The radio in the wrecked ambulance crackled. Through the static, I heard a new voice. Not mine. Not dispatch.

“The road only lets you leave when you stop looking for it.”

I turned. There was someone standing on the road behind us. A figure in the darkness, barely visible even with my flashlight.

“Who are you?” I called out.

“Someone who got out. Someone who stopped answering the calls.”

“How?”

The figure stepped closer. A paramedic. Old uniform, at least thirty years out of date. His face was weathered, ancient, but his eyes were clear.

Roy Hutchins.

But Roy was alive. I’d seen him just days ago. Hadn’t I?

“Roy?”

“I was the first one trapped here,” he said. “Back in ’63, right after they closed the road. Took me forty years to figure out how to leave.”

“How?” I asked. “Tell me how.”

“You have to refuse the next call. When dispatch calls for Old Miller Road, you have to let it go. That’s the only way to break the loop. But you’ll forget. You always forget. The road makes you forget.”

“Then how do I remember?”

Roy smiled. Sad and tired. “You can’t. You never will. But maybe this time will be different. Maybe this conversation will stick. Maybe you’ll hear the call and something in the back of your mind will whisper ‘no,’ and you’ll listen.”

He started to fade. Dissolving into the darkness like smoke.

“Wait!” I called. “What happened to the others? The seven people who died here before the road was closed?”

His voice came back faint, distant. “They never died. They’re still here. Still driving. Still answering calls. The road doesn’t kill you. It just keeps you.”

Then he was gone.

Marcus and I stood there in the darkness. Next to our own corpses. In a loop we couldn’t break.

The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50…”

I woke up in the ambulance. Parked outside the gas station. Marcus was dozing in the passenger seat. My coffee was cold in the cupholder. The radio was quiet.

I looked at the clock. 11:47 PM. Almost midnight.

My head felt fuzzy. Like I was trying to remember a dream that was already slipping away. Something about a road. A call. But the details were gone. Just a vague sense of unease.

Marcus stirred. Yawned. “Man, I keep having the weirdest dreams on this shift.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Me too.”

The radio crackled.

“Unit Seven, we have a reported 10-50 with injuries, Old Miller Road, approximately two miles east of the junction.”

My hand moved toward the radio. Automatic. Instinctive.

Then stopped.

Somewhere deep in my mind, a voice whispered: Don’t answer. Let it go. Don’t look for that road.

I stared at the radio. My hand was shaking.

“Unit Seven, do you copy?”

Marcus was looking at me, waiting for me to respond.

I took a breath.

“Dispatch,” I said slowly. “Unit Seven. Unable to locate that road. Request you send another unit or verify the location.”

Silence. Long, static-filled silence.

Then: “Unit Seven, understood. We’ll redirect. Stand by.”

The call never came back.

Marcus looked at me curiously. “You okay? You look weird.”

“Yeah,” I said. “I’m fine.”

But I wasn’t sure. Because as I sat there in the ambulance, watching the darkness press against the windows, I had the strangest feeling that I’d just escaped something terrible.

Something I’d been trapped in for much longer than I could remember.

And somewhere out there, in the darkness beyond the reach of our headlights, Old Miller Road was still waiting. Still calling. Still pulling in anyone who went looking for it.

The calls would come again. I knew they would. And eventually, I’d forget this moment. Forget the warning. Forget everything.

Eventually, I’d answer.

But not tonight.

Tonight, I let the road stay lost.

I still work graveyard shifts. Still respond to calls in the darkness. Still drive those rural roads I know by heart.

But sometimes, late at night, when the radio crackles with a new call, I feel it. That hesitation. That whisper in the back of my mind telling me to refuse. To let it go. To not look for roads that don’t want to be found.

I don’t know how many times I’ve been trapped in that loop. Don’t know how many times I’ve found my own corpse on Old Miller Road. Don’t know how many versions of myself are still there, still driving, still answering the same call over and over.

All I know is that every time I hear the name Old Miller Road come through the radio, I say no.

And every time I do, I forget why.

But I still say no.

Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s all I can do.

The road is patient. It’s been waiting sixty years. It can wait sixty more.

And somewhere, in the darkness between here and there, Roy Hutchins is still driving his ambulance. Still trapped in a loop he figured out how to escape from but never quite managed to leave behind.

Maybe we’re all still there. Maybe we never left.

Maybe every paramedic who’s ever worked these roads is driving through their own version of Old Miller Road. Answering calls that can’t be answered. Finding accidents that haven’t happened yet.

Or maybe I’m just losing my mind.

Either way, I keep driving. I keep working. I keep saving the lives I can save.

And I keep refusing to look for roads that don’t exist.

Because I know something now. Something important, even if I can’t quite remember why I know it.

Some roads don’t want to be found.

And some calls shouldn’t be answered.

I managed to feel drugged and run away, as I knew that something was off, this lady helped me and put me somewhere safe. Ever since this event happened, I put it in the back of my mind and thought it was alright, because nothing further happened.

Now two days ago, I was at a cafe and the owner was hitting on me, however I was on the phone to my friend and I was ignoring him, but he came close to me and asked what my name was and if I lived around. Then he said the coffee was on the house because he has never seen a beautiful lady like me.

As i finished the last sip of my coffee, I immediately felt the exact same feeling of when I was in paris and was drugged. my body felt the sedation, and my mind told me run for your life, so I did.

I found myself running and went into a supermarket I was hidding near the chasier and started hyperventilating because I felt that someone was after me. I got someone to help me in the cashier and called my auntie who came to rescue me.

Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Tales of Berseria, 7th Dragon 2020, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m a liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

# Putin Approves Citigroup Exit from Russia as Bank Issues Bullish Forecasts on Eli Lilly and Stablecoins

# Atlanta Fed President Bostic to Retire in February 2026

Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic announced he will retire when his current five-year term expires on February 28, 2026. The departure opens a seat on the Fed's interest-rate setting committee during a period when President Trump seeks greater influence over the central bank. Bostic's successor will be chosen by the Atlanta Fed's board of directors, not by the White House, with final approval from the Fed's Board of Governors in Washington. Market observers note Bostic's hawkish stance on rates, suggesting his replacement could shift the committee's balance on future rate decisions.

# Fed Officials Signal Pause on Rate Cuts as Inflation Concerns Persist

Federal Reserve officials indicated a cautious stance on further monetary easing, with Boston Fed President Susan Collins stating she sees a ""relatively high bar"" for additional rate cuts in the near term. Collins emphasized the need to ensure inflation durably returns to the 2% target before implementing further cuts, citing elevated inflation driven by tariffed goods. She expects tariffs to keep inflation elevated into early 2026 and favors holding rates steady ""for some time."" Fed Governor Miran called for less restrictive monetary policy while cautioning against taking inflation data at face value. He noted that the neutral interest rate now moves more quickly than in the past and suggested quantitative easing may have been overused previously. Atlanta Fed President Bostic discussed AI's potential disruption across the job spectrum, while Fed official Perli noted that financial system reserves are no longer abundant, suggesting the Fed will eventually need to expand its balance sheet again. Miran also highlighted immigration policy's dual impact on both labor supply and economic demand.

# ECB's Schnabel Says Economy Shows Positive Momentum as Inflation Nears Target

European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said the eurozone is in a ""good place"" with current inflation and medium-term forecasts both near the 2% target. She noted positive underlying economic momentum, with domestic demand offsetting export weakness. Schnabel emphasized the ECB should focus on medium-term trends rather than overreacting to individual data points. She characterized the current balance sheet reduction as ""quantitative normalisation"" rather than tightening. However, Schnabel flagged persistent stickiness in services inflation and said inflation risks tilt slightly to the upside, while noting the ECB can tolerate small deviations from target.

# Fed's Williams Signals Imminent Return to Balance Sheet Growth as Reserves Near Target

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams indicated the central bank will soon resume expanding its balance sheet once bank reserves reach adequate levels. Williams emphasized the upcoming bond purchases represent a technical adjustment to maintain sufficient reserves rather than a monetary policy shift, noting the Fed is close to its desired reserve level though determining the precise ample threshold remains an inexact science.

At first I walked around bewildered. All around me were very tall buildings. They were all deteriorated but still being used. TV's, screens, ads were all around. Each flashing something to sell. Very few people were actually enjoying their day. Mostly I saw depressed, filthy people. I eventually walked up to a tram and was allowed to ride it. 

Looking back on it I think it was because I didn't look dirty... As if they could tell who was who in this severe caste system.

Since the start of my dream I wanted to go back to the past. I didn't want to be in the future. It was depressing. Most people worked for very little and were always starving. They were barely able to keep going, except just enough to support the top few. 

Eventually on the way, I found an old friend there, they also found them selves transported to the future and they knew how to get home. We had to get a very specific tattoo of a symbol which was used in teleportation through space time. 

I get to the tattoo shop and notice that it's very fancy and clean. There's even a coffee shop in it. I ask what's the going rate for the artist at the desk and the desk lady says, ""1 dollar"". I realize at that moment that this futuristic world is full of contracts, lies, deceits and meant to trick people into accidentally spending to much. Think of the worst phone game with ads everywhere but in real life and you can't always tell what's what. So I tell her that I'm not here to play games.

I've had on and off incontinence most of my life, but extremely mild (think late/difficult potty training, intermittent daytime leaks when I was a teenager and young child even after toilet training, none as a tween, and intermittent night issues throughout my entire life that would result in damp pajamas but only sometimes cause me to have to do laundry). I didn't wear Depends or anything like that because my parents and doctors thought it would make my issues worse. Doctors couldn't figure out what was going on, and suggested I go to the bathroom on an hourly schedule and stop drinking caffeinated things like soda or coffee, which was VERY impractical and didn't stop the leaks from happening anyway when I tried it. I did have some full on accidents in college due to roommates occupying the dorm bathroom when I had just gotten back from class and had to go badly, but those were uncommon thankfully.

After I moved out from my parents' and graduated college, I started having full #1 accidents inexplicably, and I went from the normal \~15 minutes of warning before having to go or have an accident to not having more than a few seconds of warning (I sometimes even start having accidents without realizing it when I'm focused on doing something).   
Worse yet, my #2 control seems to be getting worse for some reason. I get like 30 minutes to make it to the bathroom before I start risking #2 accidents after the first urge, when before I had hours.

I bought Depends from the local drugstore because I don't want to have to deal with giant wet spots on my jeans, but I'm scared to wear them because I don't want to make things worse by making my brain think it doesn't have to worry about making it, or otherwise somehow undo my toilet training. I've been to doctors, but even after running tests (bladder ultrasound and a UTI test) they aren't able to figure out what's wrong with me. I'm scared to leave the house at this point.

I have had lifelong issues with sleep & constipaton, then it evolved into anxiety, depression & horrible sinus issues. I had unexplained facial flushing or maybe it was just over the top compared to others playing around me at the park or at recess-I always got comments about my red face. I’ve always been itchy, very sneezy & wheezy lol By the time I hit puberty I had extremely painful periods, mouth sores, joint pain, swelling & redness, profuse sweating & facial flushing, more dread, panic & anxiety. my face has been so puffy my whole life as well. I chalked so much of this up to the fact that my parents smoked & we had a lot of dust. Headaches, fatigue, unbearably itchy ears, bloating, pain all over started in my early 20’s. Still dealing with all of my basic symptoms & quite a few new ones. Sought out a nutritionist & functional medicine clinic. Not helpful. By the time I was 22 I was having chronic migraines, felt like a baseline of a level 1 migraine that would ramp up at any point. I cut out wheat despite my career in pastry 🫠I became pregnant & suddenly I could tolerate wheat in any quantity & form. I gave birth & my anxiety shot through the roof, and I started to get migraines again. I became pregnant again & this time I felt better when I ate wheat. I never really stopped after giving birth the first time. I became pregnant with my second & my OCD ramped up(didn’t know the true nature of OCD & got diagnosed after giving birth). I felt like I had this creepy crawly itchy feeling all over from head to toe through the pregnancy. Docs said I was fine. After a severe hemorrhage, I lost 11 liters of blood. For sure got close to the bright light. I spent 3 years in absolute agony trying every to fix it. I am grateful I finally had the means to explore medically. Up until my second kid was born, I literally couldn’t afford to go to the doctor, just for them to tell me it was just in my head. again, being suicidal I tried SSRI’s again, the 8th one since I was in my early 20’s & none of them worked even though I stuck it out for the loading period of idk, 6 months? None of it helped. I began to try migraine meds after weaning my baby. Nothing worked. You name it, I have tried it. I got a food allergy test done & it said I was minorly sensitive to eggs & wheat so that has been eliminated for over a year now. It helped, but coffee was the trigger I needed to eliminate & once I did, I felt a big improvement. I spent so long with constant migraines & the world just kept spinning. I was absolutely spiraling. If it wasn’t the migraine pain it was the pain of feeling insane & like a dramatic person for whining about a headache. I have hemiplegic migraines, and the regular kind too…up until 3 weeks ago. I have been seeing an allergist & they took a sample of my tryptase levels & did a cheek swab to check me for the genetic marker for HaTs…well, in the mean time she prescribed meds(Pepcid 80mg, Cromolyn sodium, Allegra) that treat those & I have been migraine free for the first time in 3 years!!!! I am on linzess to be more regular, because chronic constipation contributes to migraines, especially postpartum when leaky gut can be an issue. I hope this helps someone who is at their whits end. I was there. It feels so hopeless, but there is hope.

TLDR; Came back to the migraine sub to describe my health history leading up to migraines & finally a diagnosis. Feel free to ask me questions, I’m an open book & I just want to help.

Edit; HaTs is Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia which means I have a genetic predisposition to high tryptase. From what I currently understand, my body is and will always be beyond a baseline for an allergic reaction of any kind. I could send myself into a migraine episode if I hang out on the beach & eat pickles because both increase histamine & my personal base level is already high. My tryptase is so high that the allergist prescribed an epi pen.",1,1763000619.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

**It was a disorienting sensation. Usually, I woke up to the sound of Silas's alarm (which he ignored) or the sound of him leaving for the garage. I never woke up to the smell of breakfast. Breakfast was usually a granola bar I ate over the sink.**

**I rolled over, reaching for the warm weight that should have been beside me.**

**The sheets were cold.**

**Panic, sharp and immediate, spiked in my chest. I sat up, blinking against the bright morning light. The memories of last night rushed back. The fight, the kiss, the bathroom, the octopus-cuddling.**

**Had I dreamt it? Had he regretted it? Had he packed his bags and left for Mexico?**

**""Stop panickin'.""**

**The voice drifted in from the doorway.**

**I whipped my head around. Silas was leaning against the doorframe. He was dressed. Jeans, a black t-shirt that was tight across the chest, and his boots. He was holding two mugs of coffee.**

**""I wasn't panicking,"" I lied, my voice raspy with sleep.**

**""You looked like you were about to call the cops,"" he deadpanned.**

**He walked over to the bed and set one of the mugs on the nightstand. ""Drink. You're useless without it.""**

**He sat down on the edge of the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight. He took a sip of his own coffee, watching me over the rim. He looked... good. Rested. The tension that usually lived in his shoulders seemed to have evaporated.**

**""You made breakfast?"" I asked, reaching for the mug.**

**""Sunday,"" he said. ""Made biscuits.""**

**""You made biscuits,"" I repeated, brain still catching up. ""Like... from scratch?""**

**""Is there another way?"" He looked genuinely offended.**

**This was the ""redneck"" part of the paradox. Silas could fix a transmission, quote philosophy, and apparently, make biscuits from scratch on a Sunday morning.**

**""So,"" I said, clutching the warm mug. ""We're... good?""**

**He reached out, his bandaged hand brushing a piece of hair off my forehead. The gesture was so casual, so intimate, it made my stomach flip.**

**""We're good, Asa,"" he said softy. ""Eat your breakfast. We gotta go.""**

**""Go where?""**

**""Gotta fix this thing with Chloe.""**

**I groaned, flopping back onto the pillows. ""Do we have to? Can't we just... stay here? In this room? Forever?""**

**""She's your friend,"" he said, standing up. ""And she brought wine. We were rude.""**

**""You were rude,"" I corrected.**

**""We,"" he insisted. ""Get dressed.""**

**He walked to the door, then paused. He turned back, looking at me amidst the tangled sheets. His eyes darkened, just a fraction.**

**""And put on that blue sweater,"" he said. ""The one with the hole in the sleeve.""**

**""Why?""**

**"" looks good on you,"" he muttered, and then he was gone.**

**Thirty minutes later, we were in the truck. The shing-shing-shing was gone, the engine purring smoothly. I was wearing the blue sweater. I had a belly full of possibly the best biscuits I’d ever eaten (fluffy, buttery, defying the laws of physics), and Silas was driving with one hand on the wheel and his other hand...**

**Well, his other hand was resting on my thigh.**

**It was a heavy, claiming weight. Every time he shifted gears, he’d move it, shift, and then put it right back. It was distracting in the best possible way.**

**We pulled up to Chloe’s apartment complex. It was a nicer building than ours, with actual landscaping.**

**""What's the plan?"" I asked nervously. ""She's probably furious.""**

**""She's not furious,"" Silas said, cutting the engine. ""She's dramatic.""**

**He reached behind the seat and pulled out a brown paper bag.**

**""What's that?""**

**""Peace offering.""**

**We walked up to her door. I hesitated, my hand raised to knock. Silas didn't wait. He reached past me and pounded on the door three times. Bang. Bang. Bang.**

**""Si!"" I hissed.**

**""Open up, Chloe,"" he called out, his voice deep.**

**There was a shuffling sound, and then the door was yanked open. Chloe stood there in a silk robe, her hair in a messy bun, looking fierce. Her eyes narrowed when she saw us.**

**""You two,"" she said icily. ""To what do I owe the displeasure?""**

**""We brought biscuits,"" Silas said, holding up the bag.**

**Chloe’s eyes flicked to the bag. Then to me. Then to Silas. Then, inevitably, to Silas’s hand, which had found its way to the small of my back.**

**Her eyes widened. She looked at the hand. She looked at my face (which I’m sure was bright red). She looked at Silas, who was looking at her with a calm, steady expression.**

**""Oh my god,"" she whispered. The anger vanished, replaced instantly by a dawn of realization. ""Oh my god.""**

**""Are they the buttermilk ones?"" she asked, pointing at the bag.**

**""With the sausage gravy,"" Silas confirmed.**

**""Get in here,"" she commanded, stepping back and waving us in.**

**We walked into her bright, cluttered apartment. She pointed to the kitchen table. ""Sit. Explain. Now.""**

**Silas sat down, looking entirely too comfortable. He unpacked the biscuits and a Tupperware container of gravy he’d apparently smuggled out.**

**""Not much to explain,"" Silas said, opening the container. ""Asa finally stopped lyin'.""**

**""I stopped lying?"" I squawked. ""You're the one who was playing 4D chess with my emotions!""**

**""It worked,"" Silas said, tearing a biscuit in half.**

**Chloe looked between us, a slow, delighted grin spreading across her face. ""So... the Ben thing?""**

**""Dead,"" I said.**

**""And the 'roommates' thing?""**

**""Dead,"" Silas said. He looked at me then. It wasn't a sappy look. It wasn't a movie-star look. It was just... him. Solid. Unmovable. Mine.**

**""He's my boyfriend,"" Silas said. The word sounded strange and clunky in his mouth, like he was testing the weight of it. He frowned slightly, then corrected himself. ""He's my partner.""**

**Partner.**

**That felt right. It felt like the mechanic and the wrench-holder. The reader and the listener. The redneck and the intellectual.**

**Chloe let out a squeal that was high enough to crack glass. ""Finally! I knew it! I mean, I didn't know know, because you,"" she pointed a manicured finger at Silas, ""are impossible to read, and you,"" she pointed at me, ""are a disaster. But I felt the vibe! The vibe was terrible yesterday!""**

**""The vibe was necessary,"" Silas grunted, eating a piece of biscuit.**

**""I'm sorry, Chlo,"" I said sincerely. ""For snapping. Really.""**

**She waved a hand dismissively, her mouth already full of biscuit. ""Forgiven. These carbs are magical. Silas, you're a wizard.""**

**""Witch,"" I corrected under my breath.**

**Silas heard me. He glanced over, his eyes glinting with that hazel amusement. He nudged my knee with his under the table.**

**""Eat your breakfast, Babe"" he said.**

**I looked at him. I looked at my best friend, my impossible paradox, my partner. I looked at the biscuits. I looked at Chloe, who was currently planning our wedding on her phone.**

**And for the first time in my life, I didn't want to be anywhere else. I didn't want to be someone else. I didn't want to be with a graphic designer named Ben.**

**I wanted exactly what I had.**
