I‚Äôm working with a supervisor, we are the 2 person marketing team at our organization.

There are 2 projects happening right now, a newsletter and a commemorative photo book which is mostly photos and captions. 

He‚Äôs changed the process of the newsletter to include InCopy and expects me to design the spreads without content. Just throw down a bunch of blank boxes without a clue as to how long these articles are and seeing no photos. 

Also, the book of photos. He showed these pages of blank boxes to the bosses and again is expecting me to design a ‚Äúcoffee table/ art book‚Äù with blank boxes to fill in later.

I‚Äôm not used to working this way and I think it‚Äôs creating less engaging work. I also find InCopy to be cumbersome and clunky.
Not worth whatever benefits it offers to such a small team.

Are these practices he‚Äôs trying to implement to you big-timers? I‚Äôve never heard of anyone designing with ‚Äúwireframing.‚Äù

I think it‚Äôs his first management job and he‚Äôs trying to make us more efficient, but I think the work is suffering from it.

From accents to vocabulary, British and American English have plenty of variations. 

I personally find the American accent much easier to understand. Back in school, we used to learn British English, but after having watched all the American movies, the American sounds much more familiar to me. That said, I still find the British accent more charming, it just sounds elegant! 

What are your experiences? Especially if English is not your native language, which one do you find easier to understand?",1,1742479650.0,languagehub,0,1.0,False
1jfppyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1jfppyw/trip_report_staying_at_disneyland_hotel/,Trip Report - staying at Disneyland Hotel,"Just got back from our trip to Disneyland Paris and thought I would like to write a trip report. It's really long so don't worry if you don't want to read it! Just wanted to write it down and would like to read it back for nostalgia!

Day 1

We booked to stay 2 nights in the Disneyland hotel. To get full use of our 3 parks days we decided to stay at a local hotel the night before and the end of the last day. We stayed in Dreamcastle the night before and in Newport bay the last night. Both booked through Hotels.com.

The day we arrived we stopped in Val de Europe first. We had lunch and went to Lidl and Auchan to pick up bits like water, prosecco, beer and snacks. We then checked into our hotel Dreamcastles and went for a swim in the pool. The pool was nice but smaller than I thought. The hot tub was also a bit small. The kids had fun for a while and then we left to go get ready to go for dinner. We decided to eat at Rainforest cafe. We got the hotel shuttle bus to the village and it arrived quite quickly. Think it comes every 10 minutes.

We went to the shops and the kids spent their spending money immediately! My son spent all of his in the Lego shop and my daughter spent a bit in World of Disney and the Lego shop. I made her save some money as I knew she would regret it if she blew it all before even entering the parks! I also decided I wanted a Pandora bracelet as I didn't have one so I bought it and a charm in the new shop in the village. 

Skip tax

I decided this trip I would work out how to do Skiptax so I started to scan my receipts and log purchases as we went along. I got quite addicted to this and was very quick to get them scanned and registered each shop! Unfortunately when we were in Val De Europe we bought a few things from Primark and another clothes shop and the receipts didn't work as they don't say SKIP TAX on them. So bit disappointed I couldn't claim for those, but will know for next time to ask for a skip tax / vat receipt. Mostly every shop in the Disney village and Disney parks gives receipts with skiptax on them so those are easy. The Lego shop doesn't so make sure you ask for a skip tax receipt. I didn't ask before my sons purchase so I didn't get a skip tax receipt. but at the till they were able to email me a skip tax receipt. For my daughters purchase they selected skip tax I guess and I got a receipt that I needed. Each purchase I scanned the receipt and logged the amount. I just kept one trip open and scanned receipts as we went along. By the end of the trip I had over ‚Ç¨100 to claim back in tax! This is only for physical things like toys, bags, jewellery etc. Doesn't count for food and drink I'm afraid. 

Rainforest Cafe

We ate at the rainforest cafe which was nice for the scenery but the food was pretty basic. We were thinking of going back to Val de Europe for dinner but restaurants were so busy when we went for lunch so we decided to just stick to the village. To be fair we didn't have to wait for a table at rainforest surprisingly so was happy about that.

After dinner we went back to the hotel via the shuttle. The shuttle was very busy going back with a huge queue of people waiting for it to arrive. It did come soon after and I think on its scheduled time, but was filled to the brim.

Day 2

Our first day in Disneyland. We decided to skip the free breakfast at Dreamcastle and go straight to Disneyland hotel for about 7.30am. I checked us in and picked up our Magic passes and all the information. Also got my daughter a birthday badge. Glad we went early as this did take a bit of time. We got extras such as half board, 1 day fast pass, photo pass, celebration cake. I booked Royal dream for my daughter as a surprise birthday present and booked reserve viewing for fireworks for our last night. I also booked Lumiere and the Royal banquet for our meals for half board. Once we had all our info the very helpful staff member gave us a treasure hunt to play while killing time. You solve clues and go around the hotel solving them. We got bored after the first clue and decided to just explore by ourselves which was fun enough, but might be something nice to do if looking for some time to kill (pretty unlikely in Disney tho!). 

We then went for magic hour. When I first was thinking of booking the hotel last year I thought that guests had their own entrance to the park. This turned out to be not true unless you were staying in castle club. You get a lift down to the park if you pay for castle club. However, I didn't find the park entrance too busy this time. Last year we stayed at Art of Marvel and the one time we went for Magic hour it was heaving and took a good 10 to 15 mins to get into the park beyond the 8.30am start. This time, the entrance wasn't too busy and we got into the park at 8.30pm. Maybe because Big thunder mountain was closed most people don't see the point for going to magic hour any more? 

We decided to go to do Peter Pan ride first as we didn't get to do it last trip. Got to the queue quite quickly then found out it was closed! Lol! So decided to go do the Dumbo ride first. Then did buzz twice and hyperspace mountain once. After this we decided to go back to the hotel for breakfast. There wasnt much to do in magic hour so did feel pretty pointless tbh. Not a good selling point when all the rides aren't even open! For those that don't know, for magic hour currently the only rides open in Disney park are Peter Pan, Dumbo, Buzz lazer blast and Hyper Space mountain. Big thunder mountain also included but was closed. In Studio park more rides are open, Spiderman web, Avengers Flight, Tower of Terror, Ratatouille and usually Crush coaster but was closed when we visited. Didn't try magic hour in the studio park as we were closer to the Disneyland park so always started there. 

We then went for breakfast in the hotel. We decided to use our breakfast voucher that first day as the following day was our fast pass day so didn't want to have to fit in breakfast. Last year we ate breakfast pretty early before heading to the park. It was too early for us and we barely ate much. This time as we decided to eat after magic hour we were hungrier and enjoyed it more. Definitely something worth doing if staying at the Disneyland hotel. The food was ok but we did find it a bit cold. It was quite busy when we went around 9.30am. We were in the room on the left which had tables pretty close together. The coffee was ok. Being the Disneyland hotel you would have thought you could get lattes, cappuccinos etc, but the only coffee option was black with milk. The kids could have hot chocolate though which was nice. I opted for a hot chocolate for our last breakfast as it was nicer than the coffee. Also, both times visiting for breakfast wasn't offered a coffee refill. 

After breakfast we went for a princess meet we had booked. I went to book the meet the week before our visit but unfortunately the 8am and 8.15am visits were booked up. Seemed that way every day we went. We got an appointment for about 10.45am.  Princesses change every 45 mins. My daughter bought a signature book this trip which was actually fun and even more worth it as staying in the princess hotel. By the end of the stay she managed to see Belle, Cinderella, Rapunzel and Jasmine in the princess meets. There were times when the princesses were the same. They seemed to rotate the same few each day. The first day she saw Belle and Cinderella once and when turning up for a meet later in the day it was Cinderella again so cancelled. The second day she saw Rapunzel twice and the last day saw Bella and Jasmine. Would have seen Jasmine twice but cancelled the appointment when realised it was the same princess. They don't tell you who the princess would be so you do sometimes go for no reason. We managed to fit in 2 or 3 meets a day. After Lumiere she only had Tiana and Snow White left. But she was still happy she got so many. I guess they maybe add a new princess each day and as we only could book 3 days so some weren't available the days we visited. But maybe they were in different times when we were busy in the parks. 

After this we got ready for my daughters makeover. We had time to kill so chilled in the lobby outside the restaurants and the bar. We got to see some princesses on the balcony of Castle club. Got a few waves which was nice. 

My daughters royal dream appointment was at 11.20am. I booked our visit back in April 24. At the time the princess makeovers was only bookable for hotel guests. Initially I didn't book straight away but decided to book for her after a few weeks. Luckily I booked it before it became open to everyone. I also kept changing the appointment as initially was going to take her in the later afternoon so she would be fresh for dinner in Lumiere, but changed to morning as thought would be best if she got to be a princess for the day. So glad I got her booking in last year as it was definitely fully booked the day we arrived. 

We had already decided she would wear one of her own princess dresses as she already has 3 and I had bought her matching shoes for each of her dresses! Cheap on tiktok shop!. So they said to come back at 11.30am as the first 20 mins is meant to be looking around the shop and picking your dress and accessories. We decided to go to the bathroom to get her dressed. She could have used the Royal dream dressing area but had to wait until 11.30 to use it. So just went to the toilet to do it. When we got back at 11.30 she still had about 10 mins so she looked around the shop and picked an accessory that I bought for her. A necklace and earrings. While waiting to go in there was people coming in and asking for appointments. Someone that was staying in the hotel 3 days asked if they had any appointments and they didn't for the whole 3 days. I did ask if they kept appointments for hotel guests but they dont. I'd be really quite upset/annoyed if we spent the money to stay there and weren't able to get an appointment. She had her makeover and was very happy with the results. She was amazing with the photographer after and had a great time doing all her regal poses! I messaged my husband to come with my son for the photoshoot too. So after her individual pics we got some group shots. As we had a photo pass they all went on the photopass and she got to pick one that they printed and framed. I forgot they did the printing and framed pic bit so it was a nice touch. The cost was about ‚Ç¨95 for the makeover without buying a dress. With getting all the photos and the family photos it was well worth it. I also managed to claim the tax back on it also so happy days! 

After this point we went to studio park. The plan was to see the Stitch show and then the pixar show before doing some rides, but after the stitch show my daughter had a headache so wanted to go back to the hotel. Luckily we had one calpol sachet in the car so my husband retrieved that. Do bring calpol as it's impossible to get in the park! I believe Val de Europe is the closest place.

Luckily while waiting in the lobby, I got a notification that our room was ready so we managed to go to our room. A week before our trip there was an option to make special requests. I requested a room near reception and a little mermaid themed room. We got both. Was so glad we were in the main building as the rooms in the other building you had to get to 2nd floor and walk across the bridge to get to the rooms. As we were in and out the hotel often, our room was in a perfect location for us. 

The kids were happy chilling in the room for the afternoon and managed to fit my daughter in for a few more princes meets. Early evening we took our daughter to it's a small world as she wanted to go on it before the parade. My son decided to stay in the room. He's old enough to do that and was happy to stay and chill. It was the first time I had seen the parade as I missed it last visit. The parade was ok but I saw splash of colours last year and that was sooo much better. Wish it didn't end because I was most looking forward to seeing that and didn't realise it was temporary. After this we went back to room and got ready for dinner at the Lumiere. 

Lumiere restaurant 

The meal was nice in the Lumiere but probably a bit too fancy for the kids. My son went for a prawn starter but it was a bit too fancy for him so he didn't enjoy it. I ordered my daughter the pastry puff which was nice but she didn't like the look of it. I had the scallops and my husband had lobster. I quite enjoyed my starter. For mains my daughter had the chicken and my son had the beef. Hers was a bit bland as there was no gravy or sauce. My son's beef looked better and my daughter wished she had that instead! Myself and husband both got lamb which was nice but portion were pretty small with one ravioli as the side! The puddings were ok but not as tasty as I would have expected. My daughter had a red rose cake which I thought would be chocolate mousse but was strawberry mousse which she didn't enjoy. I didn't enjoy it either. My son had a chocolate mousse which he demolished so must have been nice! I had the signature beauty and the beast mousse cake which was nice but I've had better deserts at the Downtown buffet! Can't remember what my husband had but it also didn't taste as good as it looked. No soft drink was included for adults so we opted for tap water. ‚Ç¨8 for a coke was a bit too much! Kids luckily got to have a soft drink with their meal.

Forgot about the princess meets! The prince and princesses started to arrive when we were finishing up our mains. I was a bit anxious as I was getting worried they wouldn't turn up before we had finished our meals. They did turn up and we manage to see 3 prince and princesses who all signed my daughters book and we got pics of the kids with them. We saw Belle, Aurora and Ariel and their princes. So my daughter manage to get two new signatures for her book! Forgot to mention the book comes with a photo slip on each page so you can add a pic of each encounter. We will have fun picking the pics to add to the book for a nice keep sake for my daughter at some point soon. 

Day 2 - fast pass day

Decided to start in Disney park for magic hour as it was closer. We weren't planning to use the fast passes for the hour but thought we go get on some rides twice /three times because of the fast passes. While walking to Peter Pan to attempt to go on it again, we spotted Stitch and a very short line forming! So we decided to hell with the plan and went to meet stitch. Didn't have to queue for long before seeing him. Got some photos but daughter was sad she didn't have her signature book with her! We decided we would go to see Stitch again on our last day in magic hour instead of rides so she could get her autograph. 

We then went for the Peter Pan ride. By the time we got there the queue was at 20 min wait. Decided to use our fast pass so we didn't have to wait. Got to the front very quickly and got on the ride. The ride was fine but not bothered about doing it again. After stopping for a quick bite for breakfast, we did all the rest of fast pass eligible rides in Disney park which were Autopia, Star tours, pirates of the Caribbean, and phantom manor. Decided to skip space mountain because kids didn't like it after the first go the previous day. Also didn't go to Indiana Jones with the kids because my daughter didn't meet the height requirements and my son didn't want to do it. Didn't do buzz on fast pass in the end. We then headed to studio park. Planned to do Avengers first then go to spiderman then Tot. Unfortunately my daughter started crying when getting on avengers so we got off before it started. My son hated the and I felt bad that I didn't realise it was a fast ride. I should have done my research first before just blindly going for all rides! So after this my son didn't want to go on more rides! We convinced them to go for a few more as we had the fast pass, but as we hadn't been on them before the kids were reluctant as they didn't know what the rides would be like. I convinced them to go on Ratatouille and Cars road trip as I thought those were definitely for small kids. I said spiderman web would probably be ok but they didn't want to. They were ok on Ratatouille and Cars road trip and maybe even enjoyed them! We then stopped for lunch and said we would go back to the hotel after this. We went to Belle Norte but the queue was massive. Deicided to go to Colonel Hathi's outpost for pizza there. Much better choice as it was quite and loads and loads of tables. We sat outside as the sun had decided to shine. Kids were feeling better after food but still wanted to go to hotel to chill. We took them back and left them in the kids club while we did the rides they didn't want to do. We went to Indiana Jones first then back to studio park to do ToT and Spiderman web. We agreed that ToT would have freaked them out but spiderman was amazing and they would have loved it. We managed to fit in a character meet with suri as black panther before heading back and collecting the kids then went back to the hotel room. After a rest my son went with husband to do spiderman. We scanned two fast passes but they didn't check names so husband was able to go with my son to do it with the other two passes. My daughter was disappointed but we decided we would fit it in again on our last day. All in all the fast pass was ok and worth it and we managed to do most rides. I didn't go on avengers but not sure if I want to go on it anyway after my son's reaction! I think with kids it is quite difficult to do all the rides as they were ready to go back to chill by 12noon! We wouldn‚Äôt do fast pass again but glad we got to experience most rides. We did 2.5 days last visit last year and barely got any rides in. Now when we come back we can pick the rides we like and that aren't scary!

Fleur de leis bar

Before dinner we had a few princess meets booked in so decide to do the meet then chill in the bar before the next meets before dinner. Decided to splash out on a glass of champagne as we hadn't spend much that day so was feeling we had some cash to spare! Got my son a hot choc and my daughter a coke and husband had a beer. Bill came to about ‚Ç¨50 ISH. Got some nice free snacks but didn't want to eat too much as had the buffet shortly! Wish we did the bar when we didn't have big meals coming up! Only had 30 mins there in the end as our dinner booking came faster than expected! The champagne was nice, but I'm not really a champagne drinker. I prefer prosecco! But no prosecco on the menu so opted for one of the cheapest options! Last year we had a drink in the marvel bar and they had a deal that you could buy a glass of champagne and get to keep a souvenir glass it came in. That was a great deal and I still use those glasses for my prosecco drinking at home! They don't do that in the hotels anymore I don't think. Didn't go to marvel to check if they had that deal still. 

Royal Banquet 

Luckily we were put in the nicer room on the right for our dinner reservation. In this room the tables were more spaced out. For breakfast the previous day it was in the royal banquet but was sent left to the cramped tables. I think maybe they put guests in the better room with view if you are staying in the Disneyland hotel. We had a table closed to the window and were able to watch the fireworks from the window when they started. Unfortunately, the drones weren't on that night so we barely could see much. The occasional pop of a firework and that was it. You can only see the top of the castle! So bit rubbish! Will talk about the show later as we saw it properly then. Back to the meal.. the food was better. Was good to have options to choose from. The food was alright and I enjoyed it more than the Lumiere. I did go for half a lobster which was nice. My daughter barely ate anything which is a shame. The puddings were nice but I didn't find them as tasty as the puddings from the Downtown buffet. Some of the mousses were too bitter and some were fruity which I don't enjoy. Overall though the food was good. However, I wouldn't be rushing to book it again! Same for Lumiere. Nice for the experience, not for the food. For the money I expect something more luxurious. I just felt a lot of it was cold. 

The character meets were great, Mickey, Minnie, Pluto and Goofy came around loads and several times. My daughter got her autographs and was happy. 

The pool 

Because we weren't getting much from the fireworks we decided to go for a quick dip in the pool before it closed. 9.10pm we rushed to our rooms to get out cossies and rushed back! Got a good 20-30 mins in the pool. I decided I wanted to use the Dyson hairdryer available so got out the pool earlier to have time to get showered and do my hair before it closed. The changing room closed at 10pm also. Managed to get myself washed and dried my hair for a bit. But didn't bring my hairbrush etc, but still was nice to use the Dyson! 

Day 3. 

We started day 3 going for magic hour. We decided that we wanted to see Stitch again, so we took my daughter's signature book and planned to go into the park. Typically this was the first day we weren't at the gate before well before 8:30. We arrived about 8:20am and realised that the gate was open already! So we quickly joined the queue and got into the park soon after. By this point the park was getting pretty full so we missed the opportunity to get to Stitch early. There was already a really big queue but joined it anyway. We were finished by about 9am. We weren't bothered about going on any more rides so we decided to go back to the hotel for breakfast and a few more princess meets.  When we arrived for breakfast we were sent into the right room which was the bigger and more spacious room. After breakfast headed back to Disney park to try and see mandorian and Darth Vader. The queue for Mando seemed short so we all queued. Then for Darth my husband said he would queue and I would take the kids on star tours as they wanted to do it again. The queue showed 25mins for star tours and 45 mins for Darth. So thought I could take kids and be back to join queue for Darth. Typically, the Darth queue went down quickly and the star tours took longer! My husband decided to see Darth alone and the rejoin the queue for when we got there. By the time we got back he panicked and let lots of people in front of him so he was at the back! He was at the front moments before we arrived! Typically Darth then went on a break   and we waited about 30 mins before I gave up! Husband and son stayed waiting and myself and daughter went to buy bronze annual passes! (Next trip May half term!)

We had a quick chill in the hotel lobby then headed to studio park to see the Pixar show. The queue seemed like it was very very busy, but there was plenty of space in the showroom once we went in. The kids loved the show and it's definitely worth a watch. After this we went to queue for Spider-Man web adventure. We tried to run straight after the Pixar show because the queue was showing as like 5 minutes during at the start of the show but quickly it got up to 20 minutes and then 40 minutes and 45 minutes by the time we were in the queue! We had lunch reservations at Pyms kitchen for 3:00 p.m. We hoped we would get through Spider-Man web adventure queue before going for dinner. We queued up for about an hour in the end before going on the ride. Both kids loved it, but unfortunately the queue was too big to have time to go on it again. We were also a bit panicky because we were getting very close to 3:00 p.m for our lunch reservation. Luckily Pyms was across the way from the Spider-Man ride so we were practically there and made it for 3pm on the dot! 

Pyms kitchen 

Pims kitchen lunch was quite nice. The food was more geared towards the kids so they had plenty of options and they both really enjoyed it. I would say that this was the best restaurant of the visit and I would go here again. The food was good, the options were good and the desserts tasted really nice. My husband said there were ribs but I couldnt see any when I went up. He also got some good thick slices of beef. When I went up I got given 1 very thin slice carved for me. I didn't feel comfortable asking for more! You also get a drink with this meal. Straight after the meal we went for a character meet with another Avenger. My husband joined the queue at 2:00 p.m and we still managed to make it in by about 4:00 p.m. The wait was about 90 mins so we had time to do the spider man ride and have lunch before going for the meet. It was on final call when we arrived. We saw Black Panther this time and got some good pictures with the kids involved.

After this we went to collect our car from the Disney hotel and drove over to Newport bay club. We decided to go to this hotel because it was in the Disneyland park and because we were seeing the fireworks that night in the reserved area, we thought it was better to spend our last night closer so we could walk back to the hotel. In hindsight, we should have booked the reserved viewing area on one of our previous two nights. Possibly the first night because we would have been literally next to our hotel and the kids wouldn't have had to walk. But it was still nice to do it on the last night and actually the weather was warmer than it was on the first night, so probably nicer. For that reason, we decided to spend some time relaxing at Newport bay when we arrived so the kids wouldn't be so tired for the fireworks that evening. Kids obviously wanted to go swimming so after a while we went for a swim. The pool was quite big and the kids enjoyed swimming in it and the hot tub was also nice to relax in. Decided to head back to the park for dinner where we would grab a light bite. Got there about 8:00 p.m. The walk from the Newport bay to Disney hotel was surprisingly quite short and quite nice to do because we hadn't really walked through the village this trip. Once in the park we went to Market house Deli and got some Ham and Cheese toasties. I also found the cheesecake on a stick pops which had disappeared from Studio park so I was very happy to get to have one of these. The park was already quite busy at this time so soon after having some food we went straight to look for the reserved viewing area. This was actually quite difficult and it was very hard to understand where you were meant to go. Luckily there were plenty of cast members around that you could ask for directions which was needed. I spotted someone with the souvenir champagne glasses, so at that point my husband went back to the cart to see if he could get us some champagne in the souvenir glasses. We had looked for these during our visit but the cart that sold the champagne only had the frosted boring glasses. My husband managed to find the cart which was very busy with people wanting the special champagne glasses and he managed to get us some. Not sure if they sold out after or they now were back in stock permanently. Or maybe they are there just for the fireworks in the evenings.  But we were glad to get our souvenir glasses which we were able to take home. And we were able to enjoy the fireworks while sipping on champagne. Perfect.

Even though we got to the reserve viewing area for about 8:15/8.30, it was already quite packed so people must have been arriving very early to secure a good spot. We got a good spot but unfortunately there were people in front of my daughter who she couldn't see over so my husband had to carry her during the firework so that she could see. This was a shame and I wish there was a better system where maybe the kids could stand at the front and adults could stand at the back but I suppose it's a bit dangerous to leave your kids unattended. However the fireworks were good and we enjoyed them. I liked the tales of Magic show but I did think maybe they were cheaping out a bit because there really wasn't many fireworks. It was more about the projection of the Disney shows on the castle and I assume main Street. So this would be why we didn't really see any fireworks when we were watching from the Royal banquet the previous night. The cynic in me thinks they've probably tried to reduce costs by putting less fireworks and making it more about the animation but it was still nice and obviously people still want to see it and are spending the money for the reserve viewing area. Not something I would do again, but glad I booked the reserved viewing area once at least. 
 
Think I will leave the trip report there. I have written so much!

To conclude, it was great staying at the Disneyland hotel. Probably a once in a lifetime thing for us. Maybe twice! But not something we can afford to do very often. If we were to go and stay again at the Disneyland hotel I would want to go for castle club. However, the princess breakfasts that comes with it is only worth it while my daughter is young enough to enjoy the princess interactions! 

I also wish we had time to spend in the hotel! We were in and out and mostly out for the majority of the time. Didn't really appreciate it as much as I would have liked to. We only went to the pool once and for 30 mins max! The kids love swimming so feel like we missed out a bit by not having time to enjoy the hotel. However, as I have mentioned, I now have a bronze pass so may well do some chillin in the hotel for my next visit! 

Thanks for reading!

Last few weeks I am getting increasingly tired. Time change didn‚Äôt particularly help. 

I stopped my hikes as I stopped enjoying them - last few attempts were white-knuckling through exhaustion, lack of positive mood and annoyance at all people and their dogs I meet on my hike. 

I can‚Äôt knit anymore as I am not inspired by it. This happens when my overall health is on a decline. 

I can‚Äôt stop snacking in the evenings as these snacks (nuts and cheese) are THE ONLY THING that I am looking forward to, which is NOT how a good life looks like. This stupid snacking screws up my sleep and blood sugar (even though it is not a carby snacks, it still does!). This perpetuates the tiredness even more. 

I started waking up after falling asleep at night and going to get a snack, which is usually a protein shake. This drives my glucose up. 

My pre-diabetes is back - my sugar levels are going up (although I am sugar free, but I started eating one green apple, blueberries, protein shakes, and this stupid snacking which I used not to do!).

When I stopped caffeine, it worked as a laxative. Not anymore. I am constipated and have to drink Smooth Move and take cleansing capsules. It is annoying. 

I started doing hot yoga class on a peak of my good days and now I am dealing with muscle soreness which is generally good but it adds to tiredness. 

My skin all of a sudden became super sensitive and I can‚Äôt be comfortable in many clothes I usually wear with no problem. 

I can‚Äôt do any intellectual work as I am very slow and dull. I struggle for words. And I am leading a team of talented scientists! I feel like every day I lose credibility at work. I hope it is just my perception but if I do not snap out of it, it will not going to be pretty. 

I AM SICK AND TIRED OF IT!!! 

If ever during my caffeine free journey I was close to drinking coffee, it is now. This fucking coffee would give me a boost so I can go on my hikes, it will up my mood so I will hopefully snap out of muscle soreness and skin sensitivity. I believe my sugar levels will go down and I will be able to snap out of this desperate evening snacking (as if I am trying to cover a hole in me!). I believe coffee would give me back inspiration to knit. I would enjoy my life more. The stupid coffee would help me to deal with freaking time change which my body doesn‚Äôt like. Also, coffee will make me regular! 

Just needed to scream it off my chest, guys! For those who suffer without caffeine, I am with you. 

I know it will turn for the better. Maybe even today. But right now my bra (not too tight) is killing my skin. I have to wear clothes 2 sizes larger than I need to due to everything hurts.

Nor do i think they will feel the same rush of several interests comming together in one place or looking back with the same introspective feelings i have on the learning arc you can go through.
So i thought i am going to bore you with some (i think) gems from my collection.

First up Elvis Hitler. What 13 year old European boy wouldn't pick up something as offending as an album with the name Hitler in it. look at me my parents! i am edgy! I 
Well the joke was on me. This rockabilly band made some of the most awesome music i had heard and there was nothing edgy about it except for the name. But i really got addicted to their music style and in particularr to the song Green Haze. A mash-up between Jimmy Hendrix Purple Haze and the themesong from Green Acres (a show that we in Europe got to see because of the upcomming comercial networks). I LOVED it! I knew the themesong from heart and the fact you could mash up songs like this blew my mind.
Another great track on the album is Ten Wheels For Jezus (if you really want to please us (yes Lord) 2x, gimme ten wheels for Jezus!)
So if you see a 55+ man at a record fair whispering to sellers and looking shifty it is probably me looking for one of the other albums of this band.

Another mash-up but this time with performing artists. Cheap Thrills. Songs by Janis Joplin and artwork of my favorite cartoonist Robert Crumb.
And i can go in-depth about my fixation on the same type of women that Crumb fixates about but this r/vinyl and not r/Freud, i know.
But i really wanted this album for the artwork and the songs Another Little Piece Of My Heart and Ball And Chain.

And then a colleague points out Ichi-Ban radio a radio station that sounds like a 50's alternative radio station and so you get into Surf rock and art work of that era. With sea monsters attacking innocent dames and stuff like that. So now your collection grows with records just because you like the album cover art.
And of course the track on this album Psychotic Seagull

And last, but certainly not least, if someone told me a few years ago said i would buy an album with a soundtrack for a car i would have laughed them away. Me! Someone who looks with disdain at OST's (not that i don't have them but the fact that they are compiled for cash makes me look at them as lesser than other albums).
So, a score for a car?! But this one is made by Benjamin Herman! The man who made Bughouse (1&2), plays in the New Cool Collective and is, as ZZ-Top would say, a sharp dressed man.
This album is the perfect soundscape for a sunday breakfast in the garden. A piece of toast, boiled egg, a kaiser br√∂tchen with some cheese a glass of orange juice and a nice cup of coffee under a nice spring sun.
Let every day be as enjoyable as that and the sound of Sa Majeste on the background.

We are both in the process of interviewing for job opportunities closer to home, but there aren‚Äôt a ton of opportunities in my specialty out there. We also know that we need as much flexibility as possible since we have a 6 month old in daycare. 

Right now, my workday looks like the following: 
Wake up at 5:45, get ready, unload dishwasher/pump parts, get baby up around 6:15, nurse baby, leave between 6:30-6:40, arrive to the parking garage by 7:15, clock in by 7:30, work, leave work by 4, pick up baby from daycare by 4:45, arrive home around 5, load bottles and pump parts into dishwasher while my husband gets baby ready to eat solids, eat dinner and feed baby solids around 5:30, clean up baby or bathe baby, play with baby if there is time, nurse at 6:20, bedtime routine at 6:30, chores/pack up my work bag for the day ahead, watch tv with my husband, shower, pump and in bed by 9:15.

My husbands day looks like the following:
- Wake up at 5:45, make French press coffee, get ready while I handle baby, start work around 6:45, take baby to daycare at 7:30, work until 11, exercise, eat lunch, log back into work at 12, work until 4, work on chores, do any final preparations for dinner, get baby ready for dinner, clean high chair and kitchen, walk dogs, watch tv, shower and in bed by 9:15. 

On the weekends, I hang out with baby on Saturday mornings, meal plan for the week ahead, try to clean our bathroom and try to put away all bottles/pump parts while my husband works out. We try to do something fun as a family on Saturday afternoons and have the same Saturday night routine.
On Sundays, I handle the grocery shopping and meal prep for the week ahead while my husband does laundry and hangs out with baby. My husband‚Äôs family also comes over a lot on Sundays.

We‚Äôve outsourced lawn care. My in laws come over weekly to cook us a meal, walk our dogs and clean the downstairs floors/half bath for us while my husband and I are both working.

**TIFU by giving my youngest son advice on happy relationships and causing my oldest son's girlfriend to dump him**

&#x200B;

First I would like to say this actually happened on my youngest son's birthday, but today is the day my oldest son confronted me, so here is what happened...

After the cake and presents my youngest son and I were chatting. He is a young teenager and now that my wife and I feel he is old enough, and mature enough, we gave him permission to begin dating. He wanted advice on his future relationships. (His mom and I almost never fight and apparently it was noticeable enough that he asked about it) The conversation began by talking about learning to respect your partner, etc... I can't remember everything I said but here are some highlights.

Always be ready and willing to say you're sorry, even when you think you're right. Never dismiss your girlfriends feelings. They are valid, even if you don't understand them. Communicate, communicate, communicate. If something is bothering you and you don't tell your significant other, you're only hurting yourself. Listen when she is trying to tell you something, no matter how much you don't want to hear it. Put the game controller down, and mute the TV, whenever she wants your attention. End every conversation with a sign of your affection, and if you wont see her for a few hours, give her a hug, a kiss, or both, every time. Throughout the day randomly tell her you're thinking about her, you care about her, or you love her. And mean it. If you stop meaning it, figure out why and fix it, or break up. Trust is important and once you've broken it, you might never fix it again. Many people believe love is the most important thing in a relationship, but it's not. It's respect. If you don't respect your partner, or feel she doesn't respect you, talk about it and fix it, or break up. Otherwise you will both be miserable.

There were a bunch of other pieces of advice I gave him but that's the general gist. It wasn't all seriousness, we joked around a bit too. I told him this little bit of advice my dad told me a long time ago. ""You will know when your girlfriend is completely comfortable around you when she is willing to fart in front of you. Don't marry her until that happens."" Sage advice, that is.

Now, me and my youngest were sitting at my desk having this talk while he was picking out the video games he wanted to buy with his birthday money. My daughter and my oldest son's (now ex) girlfriend were on the couch playing video games and listening to us. My daughter occasionally chimed in with her own comments (She's been dating a few years now) and had her own bits of advice to give, though her comments were more about how to act on dates, places they can go, and stuff like that.

My oldest son's girlfriend hardly spoke at all. (In hindsight, that should have been a red flag. She's a talkative extrovert and also a very pleasant and generous young woman.)

Eventually my oldest boy came over and dropped off his gift for his little brother. He and his girlfriend stuck around long enough for him to have some cake, and then they left.

At this point I don't know exactly what happened. My daughter managed to get some details from my oldest son's (now) ex-girlfriend. I got some more from my oldest when he came over to yell at me for breaking up his relationship.

Long story short, my oldest wasn't being a good boyfriend. His girlfriend confronted him with some issues they've been having. She felt like he didn't respect her opinions and feelings, and she dumped him. It's that simple.

I love all my children with every bit of my heart, even when they are mad at me, and I admit I fucked up. I am to blame for his break up. But not because of what I said in front of his girlfriend. I fucked up because I didn't drill the advice I gave my youngest into my oldest boy's head when he was younger.

He wants me to post this on one of the AITA subs, but I am not going to do that. I admit that I could be a better father, and I can be a real A-hole sometimes, but I'm pretty damn sure that even though I could have 'read the damn room', THAT wasn't the real problem. Hopefully my oldest son learns from this.

TL;DR: I gave my youngest son relationship advice when my wife and I decided he was now old enough to date. My oldest son's girlfriend took that advice and confronted my oldest son, apparently because he wasn't respecting her or her feelings. They had a huge argument and broke up.

*What a strange‚Ä¶ request? I understand it‚Äôs for validation, but a son challenging his father by looking for opinions on a forum suggests such a weird dynamic.*

**Arrasor**

*Immature enough to think the internet would be on his side on this lmao. It's clearly too soon for him to start dating.*

&#x200B;

**McGryphon**

*I don't think it's too soon to start dating. I think it's time to learn from mistakes made, and take those lessons into the next round of dating.*

*I barely know anyone who always did everything right from the start in dating and relationships. The old romantic ""aww they were high school sweethearts and stayed together from that point on"" storyline has not been attained by anyone in my chosen social circles.*

*People do dumb shit. Relationships end because of it. All we can do is try to learn from it.*

&#x200B;

**jimbotherisenclown**

*Since your post makes it seem like he's reading the comments, I'm directing this to the oldest son:*

*Dude, treat women well. Not because their gender gives them any special status but because they are human, and almost everyone deserves to be treated with human decency. If you are with a partner and you realize you aren't actually invested in the relationship, just be honest and break up instead of hurting them by stringing them along. If your sole reason for a relationship is because you just want sex, there are a LOT of ways to get it if you are honest with your partners and a decent human being. Learn from this breakup and become a better partner so it doesn't happen again. And listen to your parents - it sounds like they actually understand what a healthy relationship looks like, and that is far too rare in this world to take for granted.*

&#x200B;

**MeFolly**

*Also for son:*

*That advice your dad was giving is golden.*

*You should expect to be treated that way as well. If your partner doesn‚Äôt respect your feelings, listen to you when you have something to share, take your side into account, and communicate honestly, why are you with them?*

*In a good relationship each party feels like they are getting more than they give. If all the effort is on one side, that isn‚Äôt a partnership.*

*And almost all of it applies to friendships as well. Up to you on how much physical affection you show. But if you haven‚Äôt seen your friend in a while, dropping a text with a silly meme goes a long long way.*

**Update - 9 days later**

&#x200B;

I've had a few requests for an update, but life and it's troubles kept happening each new day since my original post. I made some comments on the original post but there were just too many to answer everyone and deal with the PM's people sent me. I'll try to answer the many and varied questions in this update.

I'd like to clarify that my oldest son is a young adult, and no longer lives in my home. He came over long enough to drop off my youngest son's gift, eat some cake, and left with his girlfriend. My daughter and youngest son are still teenagers. My daughter and my oldest son's girlfriend met through my son, but they are still friends even after the break up.

With that said, on with the update; After my oldest son and his girlfriend broke up, and he yelled at me for it, many things have been said, some things I didn't know were revealed, and some secrets were told.

I gave my son a couple days to cool off before I spoke with him. My wife tried calling a few times, but he wouldn't answer his phone, so I went over to his apartment. His roommate convinced him to let me in to talk. And we did. We also did some shouting, a bit of yelling, and hugged once as well. This is when I found out that my son got a job offer out of state a few weeks ago. It's part of an apprenticeship through his trade school. He is considering it and this was one of the reasons for the recent tension between him and his girlfriend. She wanted him to stay here, where her family is, and he wanted her to go with him if he took the apprenticeship. It's almost twice the hourly rate he makes at his current job, and the apprenticeship will pay for some of his time spent in classes, although the cost of living is higher there as well.

Some people pointed out that my son is a bit misogynistic, and I initially thought that may be a bit true, and I learned part of that is from some of the examples he has seen in my home. I talked to him about this and discovered that he sees things about my marriage in a way they were never meant to be seen.

One thing that my son pointed out to me was this thing my wife and I call my ""magic coffee cup"". You see, when my wife is home, I am not allowed to make my own coffee. My wife has always made my coffee since we first started dating. This isn't something I have ever demanded, it's just the way things have always been. It became a joke between my wife and I when we were dating that my coffee cup must be magic because I've never had to fill it myself. Now, after many years of marriage, it's become something I don't even think about.

My wife will pick my empty cup up and say some silly magic words like Hocus Pocus, or Bibbity Bobbity Boo while waving her hands over it, and then she takes it to the kitchen and makes me a fresh cup. Sometimes I will pick up my empty cup and say some magic words and then shake the cup or peak inside and then in a pitiful whiny voice say to my wife ""Honey, my magic cup isn't working again."" The few times I have tried to make my own coffee when she is home, she gets up, hip checks me out of the way, and makes it for me. I learned my lesson long ago, but my kids never saw that play out when it first developed.

This is not the misogynistic act my oldest son believes it to be. I do not think it is my wife's place to have to slave for me by making my coffee. She does it because she loves doing it, not because she has to. If she told me today that I had to make my coffee from now on, I won't say a peep. I'll kiss my wife and go make my coffee.

This has become part of another running joke that we have going. The joke is we each don't let the other do specific things around the house so that the other ""forgets how to do them so we can never leave each other"". Officially, I do all the laundry, and she does all the dishes (In reality she does wash the occasional load and I do the dishes every once in a while, but we never admit to doing so). I learned to cook her favorite foods so she ""forgot"" how to make them, and she does the same for mine. For example, she can't make 'eggs over easy' anymore, and I've forgotten how to make a good 'slop' (which is sausage and egg noodles in cream of mushroom and topped with fried onions, terrible for you but SO GOOD)

This, and other little quirks, is part of our love language, and it has taken many years for it to develop. My son mistook the nuanced unspoken (or joked about) parts of our marriage for some sort of male/female traditional marriage role BS. He was seeing the end result of years of small compromises, fights, agreements, and other stuff that lead to the way our marriage works today.

Now, while I was having that talk with my oldest boy, my wife and daughter were talking with his ex-girlfriend. We all really like her, and would hate to see them broken up forever. They discovered all the things my son wasn't telling me.

From what they learned, my oldest son has been listening to certain podcasters and TikTok influencers that are very misogynistic. My son wanting her to move out of state with him, while she was reluctant to do so, is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their real problems. When they talked about their futures they had wildly differing views on what those futures would be like. For example, he got it stuck in his head that women should do the lions share of the housework.

To be fair, doing the dishes seems like it takes a lot more effort than doing laundry, since most of the time is spent waiting for a dryer cycle to finish. But doing the laundry is more than just washing and folding clothes while watching TV or playing video games. It's changing the linens, changing out the towels and robes in the bathrooms, and changing out and cleaning the curtains around the home. None of my kids has ever had to put fresh sheets on their beds, because I do it for them. My wife has done our bed maybe once in the last half dozen years. Laundry, like dishes, are monsters that you battle endlessly. In a good marriage you and your partner fights those battles side by side, no matter how you spilt up the workload exactly.

Anyway, I hate to see them remain broken up, but my son needs to grow up a bit before that has any hope of happening. I suggested therapy, though I doubt my son will look into it. He's at the age where he thinks he knows everything. He hasn't attained the wisdom to realize that no matter how perfect we think we are, everyone screws up, and sometimes the way we think is very very wrong.

Patrick, I love you, but you need to get your head out of your ass.

TL;DR: My oldest boy and his girlfriend look to be going their separate ways for now.

*Always love parents who will say how it is and not try to give excuses for their kids' behaviors even if it means hurting their own feelings in the process.*

*Tiktok influencers like Andrew Tate push out misogynistic videos all the time that attract teens/young adults who are underdeveloped emotionally to sell their own propaganda and make money off of. It's best to avoid them and sit down with your son and explain to him why it's bad for his mental health and his future partners'.*

*I hope the best for your son as he's still learning lessons such as this one you showed him. You're a great dad.*

>That said, she now knows the background on the ""magic cup"" bit that my wife and I do. Yesterday she took my cup and stared at my wife dead in the eyes and said ""Hocus Pocus"" before running into the kitchen with my cup. My wife chased after her laughing to get my cup back before my son's ex could make me a coffee.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We‚Äôve been together for a while, and our relationship is strong, but there‚Äôs this guy (27M) who‚Äôs been causing tension. For context, all three of us are gay men.

Before I was officially with my partner, this guy tried dating me. He was intense‚Äîtravelling weekly to my city without checking my availability, sending constant pictures of himself, and asking for photos in return. I told him I couldn‚Äôt meet his emotional needs, and he backed off. We stayed friendly, meeting for coffee occasionally.

When my partner and I were casually dating but not official, this guy asked for my partner‚Äôs number, supposedly to wish him a happy birthday. He then messaged my partner, their conversation quickly turned sexual, and he suggested they hook up. My partner asked if I‚Äôd be okay with it. I was extremely uncomfortable but felt pressured to say yes to avoid losing him. After a sleepless night, I told my partner I couldn‚Äôt handle the situation, and we should end things if that‚Äôs what he wanted.

My partner later came back, saying he wanted to commit to a relationship with me and move past the ambiguity. Since then, we‚Äôve been strong‚Äîhe‚Äôs attentive, makes time for me, and we‚Äôve grown a lot together.

The issue is this other guy didn‚Äôt disappear. He moved to our city, apologised for crossing a boundary, and asked to stay friends. I agreed, but his behaviour hasn‚Äôt improved. He‚Äôs overly flirty with me in front of my partner, brings up our past sexual encounters in group settings, and frequently messages my partner, inviting him to spend time alone. On a recent holiday, he joined us and took photos of our activities, later contacting me only to ask if he could post unflattering photos of me on social media (I declined).

This guy loves being the centre of attention and ""networks"" heavily with every gay man in the city. Two friends have even described him as having sociopathic tendencies.

Recently, I told my partner I‚Äôm uncomfortable with them meeting at each other‚Äôs homes. I trust my partner, but I don‚Äôt trust this guy‚Äôs intentions and worry he might push boundaries. My partner agreed but asked why this boundary is necessary if I trust him. I explained it‚Äôs not about him‚Äîit‚Äôs about protecting our relationship from someone whose intentions I distrust.

1jfpj52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suriname/comments/1jfpj52/a_very_long_post_reflecting_on_surinamese_mental/,A very long post reflecting on Surinamese mental health and my visit to Paramaribo,"Hi, everyone. I posted many months ago that I would be visiting Paramaribo, curious to learn more about Surinamese mental health and suicide. Here I present my (well overdue) follow-up! This is a very long post because I have a lot of thoughts -- hopefully it's not obnoxious. I really enjoyed my time in Suriname and learned so much while there, and I think many foreigners ask questions here but don't report back as they promise to do after their trip. I divide this post into two main sections: (1) general thoughts on Suriname followed by (2) thoughts on mental health and suicide especially in Suriname.

For some context, I am a US-based researcher. My background is interdisciplinary, and during my undergraduate education, I studied psychology, mathematics, and sociology. My travels were funded by a post-graduate award to explore mental health and suicide in different places, with a particular interest in how culture (politics, history) affects how mental health and suicide are discussed and engaged. In the future, I'm going to pursue a PhD in psychology or sociology to further explore this topic. I was in Paramaribo for two-and-a-half weeks in October 2024.

Also -- I am sure some of these reflections will be wrong or at least debatable. It's all based on conversations I had with Surinamese people while I was in Paramaribo, so it depends on their opinions to a large degree; you can feel free to correct me/them (or debate) in the comments! I'm very open-minded and don't mean to say any of this as if it's a settled fact. I would never, ever describe myself as an expert on Suriname or mental health in Suriname. You all know much more than I ever could...! I hope that this post can just spark some conversation or be useful to someone.

**(1) General thoughts on Suriname**

(I say ""Suriname"", but to be clear, I was only in Paramaribo! So, my insights here come with this major limitation.)

I don't think one can comment on mental health in a place without first thinking about the place in more general terms. This is because, to me, ""mental health"" is not a universal, biomedical process so much as it is one marked by identity and place. It may be the case that there are many things universally associated with, say, suicide. It may be universally true that people who report being depressed are more likely to die by suicide. However, how one comes to be depressed, as well as how one transitions from being depressed to considering killing oneself, can vary significantly by culture. For example, among the exceedingly depressed, one might still be at low odds of seriously considering suicide if they hold religious values that make it unimaginable. Culture does not totally determine one's mental health, but I do feel that they are related in very significant ways.

With that in mind, to learn about Surinamese mental health, I had a goal of learning as much as possible about Suriname *in general* when I was in Paramaribo. This was not so difficult because people in Suriname are maybe the friendliest people I have ever met. I have had the great privilege to travel to some 10+ countries over the past year-and-a-half; while I am hesitant to make generalizations, people in Paramaribo were simply the most generous and outgoing I encountered. The first Surinamese person I met was at the airport in Miami. A woman was looking for a seat, so I moved my backpack such that she could sit next to me. We got to chatting, and she was very excited to hear that I was also going to Paramaribo (as our flight from Miami was actually to Panama City, where we had a layover). When I told her my main goal was to learn about mental health through conversations with strangers, she was more excited still. I was quickly put in touch with several people over WhatsApp and wound up invited to several dinners where, despite my requests to pay, people insisted that I eat on their dollar. (I vow now that, whenever I meet a Surinamese person in the future, I will buy them a meal.) I also stayed at a hostel-style Airbnb in central Paramaribo, and the host -- a middle-aged woman living with her family next door -- was one of the kindest people I have ever met, eager to talk to me for hours if I'd let her, sharing food and beer and so forth. Beyond this, I had luck cold emailing an NGO, and some people who study psychology or do mental health work in Paramaribo were more than happy to meet with me. Finally, I think the response I got to my original Reddit post was also very telling. I told everyone I met about how warm people on this subreddit were, lol. (I am sorry that I somehow missed some of your DMs with advice or tips, for whatever reason I only got notifications about comments.) A caveat here may be that I got extra hospitality because I'm American. Some friends I made in Suriname that I still keep in occasional touch with laughed when I told them I found Surinamese people to be so kind. I would say, ""service here is great!"" and then they'd look at each other and laugh, saying that it's just because I'm foreign. I'm sure that's true; but even then, they would nonetheless agree with me that there is a spirit of liveliness and care in Suriname that they were proud of.

Some general things I learned or observed about Suriname were the following. Feel free to leave your thoughts or disagree in the comments. To the extent that some of these are generalizations or political, I'm sure they are only true to some degree:

1. **Cultural diversity.** Suriname, but especially Paramaribo, is incredibly diverse. I knew this ahead of time but was shocked just how true it was. I felt previously that London or New York City were the most diverse places I had ever been. Now it is Paramaribo. If I walked in central Paramaribo for 30 minutes, I would probably hear all of Dutch, Chinese, Sranan Tongo, Sarnami, and (several?) Afro-Carribean mother tongues. What was most wild was that everyone spoke more than one of these. Most people I met spoke at least some English. It was very humbling as I'm the stereotypical American in that I only know English.
2. **Economy.** The economy in Suriname is very rough. People told me that the IMF was coming in 2025, so maybe things are doing better -- it seems like the exchange rate with USD has stabilized somewhat, but it is still much worse than it was last summer. I was shocked to see that the cost of many things in Suriname were the same as they were in the US... things like coffee, bread, milk, and eating out at restaurants were quite expensive. I am not as sure about rent but heard similarly when talking to people about it.
3. **Social values.** Social values in Suriname are changing rapidly. It was interesting to be there as a gay man because I arrived to see many rainbow/pride flags around Paramaribo -- pride month in Suriname takes place in October. I wound up going to some of the pride events and met many gay people there. It seems to many people that having pride events on that scale was unimaginable in Suriname even five years ago. (I was so sad that I could not go to the large pride walk as it took place the day I was leaving.) Beyond this, there are changing values about religion and whom one affiliates with -- for example, young people are more likely to have a racially diverse friend group or a romantic partner of a different ethnicity or religion than older generations were.
4. **Connectedness.** People in Suriname are very well-connected with each other. Some people told me about a Facebook page that basically the entire country is on. I guess that's possible when the country is fairly small. This is probably biased as I was only in Paramaribo. I don't know how connected people more in the interior (or even Nickerie) are to those in Paramaribo.

**(2) Mental health in Suriname**

I will be more to-the-point here and just list some observations. They are related to the above points.

1. **Cultural diversity in mental health and suicide.** While Suriname is diverse, and while people are starting to mingle across ethnicities more frequently, it was still quite apparent that people of different cultural backgrounds in Suriname (for example, white vs. Hindustani vs. Afro-Surinamese) discussed mental health and suicide in very different ways. I met several Hindustani people who described to me that many Hindustani people did not see suicide as necessarily scary because they felt as though they'd be reincarnated. Relatedly, I met many Hindustani people who described suicide as a weak or wimpish thing, ""an easy way out"" of social problems. This, of course, prevents many suicidal Hindustani people from asking for help. I also met several Afro-Surinamese people who told me that, when they have family members who are mentally unwell (whether psychotic or suicidal), they preferred culturally informed healers -- I cannot remember the exact term, but these were like religious or spiritual leaders, referred to as using magic. Many young people expressed being way more open to discussion of mental health than their parents, who they saw as old-fashioned, not just in mental health but in related social values like those described above.
2. **Economy.** Instability in Suriname in general, perhaps best symbolized by the economy, is related to instability in the minds of many Surinamese people. Some described to me how it was very hard for them to plan for or even imagine the future when, especially in October, inflation was so bad. I met older taxi drivers who told me that they never imagined to be working at their age, yet any welfare for older Surinamese people was no longer enough to afford life in Paramaribo. I met adults at all stages of life who told me about how the money they had saved before was now worth less than when they had originally acquired it, such that they regretted not just spending it earlier on. To own a house in Paramaribo now seems impossible for many people, such that the only option is to inherit one. There are also tensions related to career. I heard about how, because Suriname has struggled with a brain drain issue, especially of highly educated people like doctors moving to Holland, the Surinamese government has now severely penalized or restricted people from leaving the country. I don't know what to make of this because the brain drain itself does seem to be a real and serious problem; yet, these restrictions do contribute to life in Suriname feeling more restricted and limited for many people. I met several very intelligent people in Suriname who struggled to find jobs that properly used their skillsets or challenged them intellectually.
3. **Social values.** These vary wildly between communities with consequences for how mental health is handled in different communities. I learned at pride month events that it is, evidently, much easier (on average) to be LGBT as a white or Indonesian Surinamese person than it is to be LGBT in a Hindustani family, and all of these are much easier still than being LGBT in an Afro-Surinamese family. (Again, these are generalizations.) Still, these things are changing so much. The pride events themselves were very diverse. I would encourage everyone reading this post to consider attending and supporting these events. I heard from people first-hand how much community support matters. I also met several people who were very excited to share with me that their family members were attending the pride events for the first time, symbolizing newfound acceptance that they didn't have previously.
4. **Connectedness.** Going back to Facebook -- the connectedness can be good, but it can also be very bad. The reason I heard about the Suriname Facebook page was because people mentioned it to me as related to suicide in Suriname. I was horrified to learn that some people found out about their friends' deaths after strangers had posted their friends' bodies online. By this I mean that, as it was explained to me, someone might find the body of someone they didn't know who died by suicide; then took a picture of this person and posted it online. The comments were oftentimes very negative (like, ""how pathetic"", saying that the person will go to Hell, et cetera). I think there's higher risk associated with reporting by news outlets, unfortunately including social media, when such a large percentage of the population is bound to consume that news. It demands that people be mindful in how they discuss issues like suicide. This is difficult to control, though, not just in Suriname but everywhere. Maybe it can present some basic opportunities though. It should not be controversial to ban callous reporting of suicide on this Facebook page...!

**(3) Conclusion**

I don't have much else to add but wanted to say thank you to this subreddit for initial tips. And thanks for reading, if you've made it this far! I also thought I should provide at least one link to more helpful information and reports on mental health and suicide in Suriname. A helpful resource is **Mind Matters Suriname (https://mindmatterssuriname.com/).** Beyond the information available through their website, you can reach out to them, and they will come to speak to your organization (company, school, religious institution) about suicide and mental health.

It's ""the countryside"", and the ability to take a walk through it and possibly find a nice pub along the way. 

As an immigrant here in the UK, this sounds absolultely idyllic and something I can see as a huge benefit to mental health. But I've got to be honest, I've got no idea what constitutes ""the countryside"" and how on earth to find it to go for a walk. 

Where I come from you can go to national parks, or private land where you pay to access the land, but you have to drive to get there and most places are a distance. There isn't really the concept of public right of way. That doesn't sound like whats implied by most that post on here. I get the impression that one could have their morning coffee and decide to go for a countryside walk on a whim, and without needing a car.

- Do I just open up Google maps and search countryside? 
- Is is simply all the National Trust locations? 
- Is it wherever I find an open field? 
- How do I know I'm not on private land etc?",1,1742478609.0,AskUK,19,0.6,False

I finished the last of my coffee and made my way to the counter. There were some wrapped cookies and brownies on display. I grabbed a cookie, paid for it, and asked for a pen.

I flattened the cookie‚Äôs receipt on the counter top and  scribbled, ‚ÄúHope this cheers you up.‚Äù

In low tones, I asked a favour of the cashier to send the cookie and note over to the man after I had left. The heartbroken one in the corner. He was easy to spot.

I left, and thought nothing more of it. Dwelling on it would give me anxiety. Like, what if he was crying from a breakup and that cookie resembled what his ex used to make for him and made him sadder? Or if his mum just passed and that was his mum‚Äôs favourite cookie? Best not to imagine the consequences. Just hope for the best and move on.

The next time I was at the cafe, it was the same cashier. She took my order, then hesitated. She seemed to want to say something to me. But she didn‚Äôt, and turned away after a moment.

I went home after getting my triple shot coffee. Lots of work to do, and I hadn‚Äôt had enough sleep.

The triple shot worked magic. I finished the entire days‚Äô work by 3pm, and had time to tend to my plants. I repotted the 2 new babies my aloe vera plant had ‚Äúbirthed‚Äù. They were the 26th and 27th aloe vera babies. The mother plant was beyond fertile. I had to find a way to rehome them, my house was turning into a jungle of aloes.

I was placing some of the pots outside my corner apartment, when I shuddered, for no good reason. I turned around, looked down the corridor. No one was there.

But the feeling of being watched continued.

I quickly put up the handwritten sign, ‚ÄúFree aloe vera plants, help yourself!‚Äù by the pots of aloe veras. Then I restocked the canned drinks I kept outside next to a sign that said ‚ÄúThanks for the delivery! Please help yourself to a drink!‚Äù and went back in.

I didn‚Äôt leave my home until dinner time. I had a quick dinner out, got back, and noticed a little scratch on my door. Around where the latch was. I must have scratched it with my keys at some point.

I headed in, showered, and went to watch a movie in bed.

It wasn‚Äôt a horror movie, but something felt off. The energy of my house felt off. There was a weird, almost viscous tension in the air. Then again, I had been pretty stressed in the past week. That was probably it.

I watched a rom com, then two, then three, until I fell asleep.

I woke up to my alarm the next day. I reached out from under my covers to switch it off. Huh. For once, I hadn‚Äôt kicked the blanket off in the middle of the night. I usually woke up slightly freezing because of that.

I skipped going to the cafe for my morning coffee. I was running up my bills. Instant coffee was going to be the norm for a while.

A text popped up on my phone screen. From an unidentified number.

‚ÄúGood morning. Hope you enjoy the breakfast at your door.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, and headed to my door. Sure enough, there was a takeaway meal at my door.

I smiled. It was probably my bestie. She did random surprises like this once in a while.

‚ÄúThanks Julie,‚Äù I replied. She had probably texted from the new work phone she had just got.

I was taking a bite of the pancake I found in the box when my phone vibrated again.

‚ÄúWho the fuck is Julie?‚Äù read the text.

I opened my mouth and let the bite of pancake fall out.

Julie wasn‚Äôt one to swear. Not in the years that I‚Äôve known her.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I replied.

No reply.

I texted Julie on her personal phone. It took her only a few minutes to respond. It wasn‚Äôt her. The breakfast wasn‚Äôt from her.

I threw it out, heart thumping.

‚ÄúDid you not like it?‚Äù came the text.

I shrieked a little. I had thrown it into the bin at home.

‚ÄúWho are you? How are you doing this?‚Äù I texted.

I hesitated for a moment, then I locked myself in my bedroom and called the police.

To the police‚Äôs credit, they reacted fast. I told them that I believed someone might be in my home, and they were here in minutes.

They found no one. I told them what had happened, and they began a search for electronic devices.

They found two.

A camera plopped into one of my plants, one which showed the view of my living room and part of my kitchen.

Another camera was in my bedroom, a tiny thing half hidden behind the knick knacks on my bedside table.

They were battery powered cameras with their own WiFi. The battery could last for weeks, apparently. I didn‚Äôt even know they made cameras like those.

I felt sick. Like a cold creature had crawled inside my skin and settled itself among my innards.

I told the police about the scratch on my door. They concluded that someone had picked my lock.

The police asked lots of questions. About exes, people I could have offended, any creepy colleague or person in my life.

I couldn‚Äôt think of anyone. There just wasn‚Äôt much drama in my life, up to that point. I couldn‚Äôt imagine anyone I knew going to such lengths to spy on me.

The police left after dusting around for fingerprints. I didn‚Äôt know they still did that. They said they would investigate, compare the prints to mine to check for any stranger‚Äôs prints. They didn‚Äôt have the manpower to leave a protective detail, or to provide any form of protection. I‚Äôve just got to be careful and change my lock. Get a better one. They would investigate the number from the text, and the recording devices too.

I got the lock changed in a day. I got the most heavyweight lock there was, one the seller claimed could not be picked. I installed surveillance cameras outside my apartment too, for good measure. I didn‚Äôt install any in my home - I was paranoid about people hacking the feed to spy on me. I‚Äôve never liked the idea of being recorded in my own home.

I was just about feeling a little safer and somewhat back to normal when I received another text, from another unknown number.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to hurt you. Please don‚Äôt be scared of me. I love you.‚Äù

I called the investigator in charge of my case. Told him about the text. They told me to screenshot it, send it over. I did that once I hung up. Another text. ‚ÄúHow could you do that to me?‚Äù

I froze. How did he know? Were there more cameras?

My phone vibrated again. ‚ÄúI told you I loved you. Why did you call him?‚Äù

I left the house, headed straight to the police station. I was about to head in, when another text popped up.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare go in there. That will make me really mad.‚Äù

I went in anyway. Met with the officers in charge. They sent me home accompanied by an officer, and told me to stay home as much as possible, and try to be accompanied by friends or family when out. Then they left, after a sweep around my floor to make sure no one was around.

I was on edge the next few days. Sleepless. No amount of checking the doors and windows made me feel better. I ordered delivery for all my meals, didn‚Äôt step one foot out the door. I made the delivery guys leave the food at the door, and opened it only when I was sure they had gone. It was when my coffee from my favourite cafe arrived that I remembered the cashier, that strange look she had on her face. It was right before all the crap started.

I took a taxi straight to the cafe. I wasn‚Äôt going to risk being out longer than I had to be.

I got lucky. The same cashier was working at the counter. I approached her, and her eyes widened. I looked down, and realised what a mess I looked. I hadn‚Äôt showered in days. I was wearing food-stained home clothes. My hair was straggly and messy.

I remembered the last time I looked in the mirror. Black circles around my eyes. Face pale.

Suddenly self-conscious, I smoothed my hair back as well as I could, and spoke as calmly as I could manage.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶the last time I saw you, you looked like you wanted to tell me something.‚Äù

She stared at me for a while, confusion apparent on her face. She didn‚Äôt remember me.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I tried to remember our past interactions, anything that would stand out. ‚ÄúI got that cookie for that guy,‚Äù I said, the memory popping up.

Her eyes widened further, and her lips parted.

‚ÄúOh. You.‚Äù She looked me up and down, a crease forming between her brows.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I wanted to tell you, that‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúUhm, the guy you got a cookie for? He‚Ä¶he kept asking about you. He wanted to know who bought him the cookie, wanted footage from our surveillance cameras. We denied him that, of course. But then he guessed it was you. He had noticed you, in your red sweater. Then he just‚Ä¶kind of camped out here every day. Until that day, when you came in. I wanted to tell you that‚Ä¶well I thought maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù she trailed off, and bit her lip.

‚ÄúThe guy who looked sad?‚Äù

She nodded.

‚ÄúWhen you came in again, I saw him light up. I wanted to warn you, but‚Ä¶ I thought maybe it was nothing, I didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss over nothing, and‚Ä¶well then you left, and he followed you out. I told my manager, he told me to stay out of it and I‚Ä¶I did.‚Äù

Of course. The man with the cookie.

Goddamnit, how had I not put it together until that moment? How did I not suspect him? I thought of the cashier but not the dude I bought a cookie for?

I called the police again. The cashier panicked, said she didn‚Äôt want to be involved. But I looked her dead in the eye and told her I was in danger. That I needed her help. She relented. We headed to the police station together, she gave her statement. We both gave descriptions of the man.

By the time I headed home, I had a new message, from yet another unknown number.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done it now. You need to be punished.‚Äù

I gritted my teeth and fought the powerful urge to fling my phone at the wall.

‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù I texted back. Not at all what the police had advised I should do.

Nothing much happened over the next several days. By the time a week passed I thought that maybe, my stalker had given up.

Still, every night, I checked that the door was securely locked, that the alarm system was up, and went to my bedroom and locked the door.

I had been to the police station again, but they didn‚Äôt have anything significant to update. They just reviewed the evidence I had given them and my statements. It was a waste of time.

I got home around 3pm, and spammed movies until I fell asleep, before the sun had even set.

I was awoken by someone calling.

It was Julie, on a video call. She had been calling daily to check on me, since I first realised someone had broken into my place.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Her cheerful voice was a ray of sunshine.

‚ÄúHey Jules,‚Äù I smiled. She said something in response, but it was all jumbled up. Her image froze on screen.

‚ÄúSorry, my WiFi sucks in my room. Hold on,‚Äù I said, and walked out to the living room.

We chatted for a while, and when she realised I was feeling okay, we said our goodbyes, with her promising to check on me again tomorrow.

I was still smiling after we hung up. Julie‚Äôs beyond awesome. I wanted to let her know how grateful I was so I used a filter app to take a funny selfie video with me saying thank you with an animal snout and ears.

I was giggling away, choosing the funniest animal filter to use, when the nose and ears of a cat filter flew from my face to somewhere behind me.

I caught a glimpse of a small face in the background where the cat filter had detected, for just a split second. It dove out of sight.

My blood froze in my veins.

I switched the app off and called the police, while running for the door.

I had just unlocked the door, when a flurry of footsteps thudded rapidly towards me. I turned, just in time for someone to snatch the phone from my hands.

It took me a moment to recognise him. It was indeed the heartbroken man from the cafe. The one I had bought a cookie for.

Before I could say a word, he had hung up and flung the phone far from me.

I screamed. With all my soul.

He leapt towards me, tackled me to the ground. I landed hard on my back, head bouncing off the floor. I was stunned, breath knocked out of me.

He covered my mouth, and pulled out a knife.

‚ÄúWhy did you force my hand? Why are you making me do this? We could have been happy together,‚Äù he said.

He began to drag me, hand still covering my mouth.

I was too winded and dazed by the blow to my back and head to do anything more than struggle weakly.

When he dragged me round the corner to where my bedroom was, I tried to hold onto the wall, but he was too strong. He pulled me free and tugged me down the corridor to my room.

Then I heard a knock on the door. I tried to scream again, but he pressed his hand hard over my mouth, and held the knife to my throat.

I stopped flailing. We were still for a long time, his knife digging into the skin of my throat.

There wasn‚Äôt another sound from the door. Whoever it was must have left. My one hope shattered.

After another agonising minute, he slowly lifted his knee off my throat. I took in great gulps of air, as he gazed at me sadly.

‚ÄúI love you. I just want us to be together.‚Äù

He looked down at his knife. ‚ÄúNothing ever works out for me. We‚Äôll just have to be together, in the next life.‚Äù

My eyes widened. What the hell?

He stroked my cheek with the back of his hand, the hand that was holding the knife.

‚ÄúYou love me too, right? There was something. You felt it. That‚Äôs why you bought me the cookie.‚Äù

Oh that goddamn fucking cookie. Fuck me for ever having wanted to do something nice for someone.

‚ÄúNow they know how I look like. They think I want to hurt you. We can only be together, in death. In our next place.‚Äù

Shit. Shitttttt. I shook my head at him. If he would uncover my mouth, I could lie. Tell him whatever he needed to hear.

He gently placed the knife against my throat.

‚ÄúYou know I have to do this. For us.‚Äù

How the hell did this guy get this intense, this obsessed, this insane in such a short period of time? Over what, a bloody cookie?

I tried to yell at him to stop, but he wouldn‚Äôt move his hand from my mouth.

Then I saw it. A movement behind him, from around the corner.

A face peered from behind the wall, wearing a nervous expression. When he caught sight of my stalker looming above me, his eyes widened with fear. Then he held up a finger to his mouth, nodded at me, and disappeared from sight.

Yes. Salvation. If my saviour moved fast enough.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really been so amazing, our time together. Until you went yet again to the police station. I thought we had worked things out. I thought you‚Ä¶‚Äù

The other man, my saviour, charged out from around the corner, a glass bottle in hand.

My stalker leapt up, turned just as the other man swung the bottle at his head. The stalker caught the man‚Äôs arm, and jabbed his knife at the man‚Äôs midsection.

The man twisted out of harm‚Äôs way, and leapt back.

My stalker pounced, landing on the man, and they tumbled out of my sight.

I pushed myself up to a seated position, ignoring the dizzying sensations that flooded me as I straightened.

Behind the wall, there were thuds, clatters and grunts.

I had just forced myself to stand, when there was a loud cry. Then silence.

Blood roaring in my ears, I took a step towards where the scuffle had ended, then hesitated.

Someone groaned, and there were the sounds of someone getting to his feet. I backed towards my bedroom door. I had just stepped into my bedroom and was about to slam the door shut when someone appeared around the corner.

I began to sob.

It was the other man. My saviour.

The police arrived soon after.

My saviour was a delivery guy. He had delivered my lunch the day before, and had taken a pot of aloe vera and a drink from my stash outside the apartment.

He had been doing another delivery nearby, and wanted to drop by to leave a note thanking me for the aloe vera plant and the drinks.

He had just left the note and was about to leave when he heard me scream. He had hesitated to enter, but he said there was something in my scream that told him something was very wrong.

He had called the police, then unable to do nothing, entered my home.

I had never been more grateful for my aloe vera‚Äôs fertility, the idea to give away the plants, and the instagram reel that had suggested doing an act of kindness for a stranger, however small it was.

Then again, it was that same reel that started me down the path of being someone who would buy someone a cookie.

The police later informed me that my stalker, after following me home, breaking in and installing the cameras that were found, had engineered a new way of access to my home. He had simply climbed up two floors, from a tree branch, to a pipe, to the air conditioning unit outside my window, and unlocked my windows by sliding in some thin piece of metal and pushing the latch up.

He had been sleeping under my bed on some of the past days.

Others, he had spent in my closet.

The entire time I had thought staying home would keep me safe, he was right in my home with me. He had been heartbroken when I first saw him, because the previous woman he had been obsessing over and stalking, had moved out. She had just upped and gone one day, and he had no idea where she went. Probably out of the state.

After I bought him the cookie, he had decided that fate had intervened. He had lost the previous woman because he was destined to be with me. He had created an intricate story in his mind, about how I had loved him from first sight. That I was battling my feelings when I called the cops, when I removed his cameras. Lots of stuff like that. I felt sick listening to the report.

Anyway, after all the police arrested him, after they had taken my statements that day, and after I felt I had poured enough gratitude out towards my saviour, I didn‚Äôt want to be home.

I went to a hotel to stay for a few nights. One with impeccable security.

A few days there, and I felt safer. Knowing my stalker was in jail gave me a peace of mind I hadn‚Äôt had in the past weeks.

I had just exited the hotel to go for breakfast with Julie, when someone holding a few luggages stopped at the door, struggling to open it with their elbows.

The doorman was nowhere to be seen.

I turned back to help, then paused.

I pulled my hood up, lowered my head so my face was covered, and stepped forward to hold the door open for the lady.

I ignored her thanks, kept my face carefully hidden, then slipped away before she could get a good look at me[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)",10,1742477929.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

1jfp3fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaintsvet/comments/1jfp3fx/feeling_mentally_spiritually_torn/,Feeling Mentally & Spiritually Torn,"Hello. Been married for over 20 years to my wife and have 4 wonderful children. Right after temple marriage I went into the military and spent over 20 years; been retired 3 years; during that time in the military, between promotion, moves, college, working over 12 hrs., and trying to raise a family, I now have depression and anxiety--always had it, but my military career pushed myself and never doubted my abilities--had a very successful career and got my master's degree when I got out; now with retired pay.

When I retired from the military, I fell into deep depression and anxiety because I had more time in my hands. Tried hobbies and career change, but all along, growing apart from my family. The military caused me to miss birthdays, and some special events; I love my wife and kiddos but don't feel close to them. My father was never there for me and my mother was always working, mother always tending to my three sisters, connecting better with them since I was the only boy--resent that for a while, but I have forgiven her. Life growing up wasn't easy, but promised never to do the same to my kiddos. However, these last three years have been miserable for me; tried reconnecting with my wife and kiddos and it's like we grew apart. My wife is perfect, she's kind and adores the kids. I'm not at her level emotionally. I don't feel we connect, though, because she has a hard time understanding why I can't move on from my military service. I miss the service and being a top performer; I miss the accountability and rapid job pace. I miss traveling and going places. My wife is a home body; her depression meds don't give her enough energy and she spends whatever time she has on the kids or talking to her friends on the phone for hours. When she hangs up, we try to talk but only for a few minutes because dinner or one of the kids needs something.

We tried dating, marriage counseling, and other things. But I'm just not connecting and she doesn't get my current condition. I am a 100% disabled veteran and get a second pension from that; able to work and move around; my conditions are more mental and have few surgeries due to running for over 20 years and exercise, plus the long hours drinking caffeine from soda products since I don't drink coffee as member of the church. Never drank, smoked or did drugs due to my beliefs of the Savior--I love the church. However, I feel I cannot continue like this; my medicines are holding me grounded, but some days are really rough. Never cheated on my wife; however, I don't feel compatible to her; it breaks my heart that I either have to stay with our temple marriage or go. I would support them financially without issues and would put all my kiddos through missions and college if they wanted, since I know that's what they want to do. I am torn mentally and spiritually. I would definitely would be in my kiddos lives more than my parents ever were, but I don't have the heart to tell my wife and kids that I will go crazy if I don't change my environment.

Any good advise is welcome. Anyone out there feeling this way? Great job, family, more than stable finances, but have grown apart from spouse? Thank you.",1,1742477878.0,latterdaysaintsvet,0,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------------------

If you've cooked with your Crock-Pot a few times, you may have noticed that it can develop some unpleasant smells over time. These odors can come from many sources, including leftover food residue, grease build-up, or even just normal wear and tear. Fortunately, there are effective methods to eliminate odors from your Crock-Pot and keep it fresh for your next culinary creation.

The first step to combating unpleasant smells in your Crock-Pot is to ensure that it's clean after each use. After you've moved your delicious meal to a serving dish, make it a habit to wash the Crock-Pot immediately. Use warm, soapy water to scrub the lid, the insert, and the outer pot. Avoid harsh chemicals, as they can absorb into the material of your Crock-Pot and affect future meals.

One popular method for deep cleaning your Crock-Pot is using baking soda. Here‚Äôs a simple approach using baking soda:

- Fill the insert with warm water.
- Add 1-2 tablespoons of baking soda and let it sit for a few hours.
- After soaking, scrub gently with a soft sponge or cloth.
- Rinse thoroughly and dry before storing.

Another effective method involves vinegar, which is a natural deodorizer. To utilize vinegar for odor elimination, follow these steps:

- Pour equal parts of water and white vinegar into the insert.
- Let this mixture simmer on the low setting for about two hours.
- Turn off the Crock-Pot and let it cool down.
- Rinse and dry the insert thoroughly afterward.

For stubborn smells that refuse to budge, you can try a mixture of lemon and water. This method not only removes odors but also leaves a fresh scent:

- Squeeze the juice of one lemon into the insert.
- Add water to fill it halfway.
- Simmer on low heat for two hours.
- After cooling, rinse and dry the insert.

If the odors persist, consider checking the rubber seal on the lid and the heating element for any lingering smell. Sometimes, food particles can get trapped in these areas. Wipe them down with a damp cloth soaked in a vinegar-water solution to eliminate any build-up.

 *Shop Here Recipes &amp; Crockpots https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *‚Äã** Air fresheners can sometimes mask the smell but using products like activated charcoal or coffee grounds can help absorb and neutralize unpleasant odors effectively. Here‚Äôs how you can use them:

- Place a small bowl of activated charcoal in the insert and let it sit overnight to absorb odors.
- Alternatively, fill a bowl with dry coffee grounds and leave them in the Crock-Pot for a day.
- Afterward, dispose of the grounds and wipe down the pot again.

To prevent smells from developing in the first place, consider lining your Crock-Pot with a slow cooker liner before cooking. These disposable liners not only make cleaning easier but also help prevent food from sticking and developing odors.

By incorporating these methods, you can ensure that your Crock-Pot remains odor-free and ready for delicious meals. Regular maintenance and deep cleaning will go a long way in keeping your kitchen appliance fresh and inviting. So the next time someone asks, ""How do I get rid of the smell in my Crock-Pot?"", you'll have plenty of effective strategies at your disposal to tackle those nuisances efficiently.

The Importance of Regular Maintenance for Kitchen Appliances
------------------------------------------------------------

Regular maintenance for kitchen appliances is essential to keeping your home running smoothly. Ignoring this can lead to various issues, from minor inconveniences to major repairs. By taking the time to care for your kitchen appliances, you can enhance their performance and longevity.

One significant benefit of routine maintenance is the efficiency of your appliances. When appliances are well-maintained, they tend to operate better. For instance, a dishwasher that is regularly cleaned and maintained uses less water and energy, which can save you money on utility bills. Likewise, a well-kept refrigerator cools more efficiently, keeping your food fresher for longer periods.

Moreover, regular cleaning and maintenance can prevent unwanted odors. Over time, food particles and spills can build up in your appliances, leading to unpleasant smells. By routinely cleaning your appliances, such as your oven, microwave, and refrigerator, you can minimize these odors and create a more pleasant cooking environment.

 *Shop Here Recipes &amp; Crockpots https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *‚Äã** Here are some practical maintenance tips to help you care for your kitchen appliances:

- **Clean Your Oven:** Wipe down the interior and exterior surfaces weekly to prevent grease buildup. Every few months, run the self-cleaning feature if available.
- **Maintain Your Refrigerator:** Regularly check and clean the coils at the back or underneath the appliance. This ensures it runs efficiently and lasts longer.
- **Care for the Dishwasher:** Clean the filter and spray arms monthly. Running a cycle with vinegar can help eliminate buildup inside the appliance.
- **Examine the Microwave:** Wipe the interior with a damp cloth regularly and avoid using metal utensils which can damage the interior.
- **Inspect Small Appliances:** Check cords and plugs periodically for wear and replace them if needed. Keep the surfaces clean and avoid overloading them during use.

Another reason to prioritize maintenance is safety. Faulty appliances can cause fires, leaks, or even electrical hazards. Regularly inspecting your appliances can help you catch potential problems early. For instance, frayed cords can pose a risk of electric shock, while gas appliances can leak harmful gases if not serviced correctly.

Staying attentive to your kitchen appliances means being vigilant about their performance. If you notice any unusual sounds, smells, or malfunctions, it's crucial to address them immediately. Ignoring such symptoms can lead to more significant and costly problems down the line.

In addition to enhanced performance and safety, you may also experience better food quality when your appliances are well-maintained. For instance, a clean oven will prevent burnt residues from affecting the flavors of your dishes. Similarly, a refrigerator that maintains the correct temperature will keep your perishable items fresher for a longer time. High-quality appliances make preparing meals enjoyable and satisfying.

As the seasons change, so should your appliance maintenance routine. Different times of the year may require specific attention. For example, pre-summer might be the perfect time to clean your barbecue grill and check its hoses, while winter is when you should ensure your oven is ready for holiday baking.

 *Shop Here Recipes &amp; Crockpots https://hownow101.github.io/Crockpots *‚Äã** Setting reminders on your calendar for regular maintenance checks can help incorporate this routine into your schedule seamlessly. Here are some tasks you might consider:

- Monthly: Clean refrigerator coils and wipe down surfaces of all appliances.
- Quarterly: Inspect cords, hoses, and seals for any damage.
- Yearly: Deep clean your oven and dishwasher, and consider professional servicing for significant appliances like your refrigerator or washing machine.

Investing in quality appliances also entails a commitment to their upkeep. Regular maintenance can help you maximize the return on your investment. The better your kitchen appliances perform, the more you will appreciate their capabilities. They will serve you well for many years, toasting, blending, cooking, and preserving food with ease.

Taking care of your kitchen appliances might seem like a chore, but the benefits far outweigh the effort involved. Through routine cleaning and timely repairs, you‚Äôre not only ensuring their longevity but also cultivating a safe, efficient, and enjoyable cooking space in your home.

### Conclusion

Keeping your Crock-Pot smelling fresh doesn't have to be a challenge. By employing effective methods to eliminate odors, such as using baking soda, vinegar, or even citrus peels, you can easily restore its pleasant scent. These simple solutions not only attack the smells directly but also revitalize your cooking experience.

Equally important is the regular maintenance of your kitchen appliances. By cleaning your Crock-Pot after each use and keeping an eye on potential odor-causing residue, you can prevent buildup that leads to unpleasant smells. Routine care not only extends the life of your appliance but also ensures that each meal you prepare is flavorful and enjoyable.

Maintaining a clean and odor-free Crock-Pot is part of a larger commitment to a well-organized and hygienic kitchen. When you take the time to care for your appliances, you're enhancing your cooking environment, which ultimately contributes to a more enjoyable and efficient experience. Remember, a well-maintained Crock-Pot not only helps you whip up delicious meals but also keeps your kitchen smelling fresh and inviting. So, roll up your sleeves and make odor prevention and appliance upkeep a part of your cooking routine. Your taste buds‚Äîand your nose‚Äîwill thank you!

1jfozx9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfozx9,Help with living room wall/kitchen.,"Hi! So I've been wondering what to do with my apartment. I'm currently renting this, and am hoping to get an urgent document for relocation, but unsure how long that will take still. So we don't want to pay too much for any renovations/furniture we're buying. 

Anyways, we are having problems with cabinet space, we had too little, so we're buying 2nd hand furniture (cabinets etc. See inspo pics). These are going to be against the living room wall (468cm from the door, 290cm high) and is completely white. 
As the furniture is white too, we're wondering if it's going to be too white?

We have a brown leather couch, two coffee tables coming in next month (see inspo Pic as well), and a light wood laminate flooring. 

We're also thinking of re-organizing the kitchen, but unsure how to do that. 

Does anyone have any inspiration/ideas for the living room wall. Should we paint it, leave it, add something? 
And what about the kitchen?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jfox42,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1jfox42/first_time_on_celebrity_tips/,First Time on Celebrity - Tips?,"My wife and I will be going on our first Celebrity cruise this year (Edge class) with our baby boy, who will be just shy of 1 when we go. First off, please no abuse towards us for choosing this cruise - I'll give our reasons at the bottom - but I have a few questions for regular Celebrity cruisers, and anyone who can answer these for us that's much appreciated!


One thing that was very appealing to us about Celebrity was the 4-restaraunt main dining setup. We have early dining - I'm curious, do we need reservations for a specific restaurant per night, or is it assigned, like Disney's rotational dining? Or just walk up?


Similarly, we're excited about the entertainment on board - for shows, are reservations needed? On our first cruise, they weren't strictly required, but essentially needed to get good seats, as walk-ups generated massive lines. Is this something that's available?


Lastly, just curious in general - around what time do shows/etc. typically run on Celebrity? Do the main shows run on multiple days (we are on a 7-night cruise)?


Thank you to anyone who can provide insight!


For anyone wondering why we would choose Celebrity with our boy, some background - we went on our first cruise last year, on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, and had an amazing time. We were looking at many different lines, including Celebrity and Virgin, and ultimately decided on Royal, thinking the expansive entertainment options would be better for my pregnant wife, who obviously could not drink. We had an absolutely wonderful time, and knew we would book another cruise. However, when looking into our options, Royal didn't really have what we wanted - for the timeframe and price, Royal offered shorter sailings on Utopia, which we've heard has a ""party"" vibe, not to our tastes - and longer sailings either were routed to Haiti, which we are not comfortable with, or were on the prohibitively expensive Icon or Star of the Seas.


So looking into alternatives, we wound up narrowing it down to Disney, Carnival, or Celebrity. Disney seemed like the best fit on paper, due to the line's reputation, and having amenities like a nursery. But upon looking closer, things like the nursery are first-come-first-serve reservations, and we are on the bottom rung for booking anything - and because of their policy disallowing children in the adult district, we may not even be able to see any of the more laid back, relaxing areas and just be part of the hustle and bustle. It also cost more for 5 nights versus 7 on Carnival or Celebrity.


Then between Carnival and Celebrity, we just weighed what we valued in our cruise experience - we don't want a massive ship, potentially with loud, drunk, vulgar patrons with a baby. We have also seen footage of major fights aboard Carnival ships, and just had concerns there, though the ship did look very nice.


After talking with a Celebrity rep, who said we can bring our boy to any venue on the ship, including specialty restaurants, we just decided it was the best fit. We loved Royal, but the things we loved were the relaxing bars with live piano, the Central Park area with its chilled out vibe, the specialty dining restaurants we chose to indulge in. Our typical day was, I'd wake up earlier than my wife, get a coffee, go to the gym for an hour, we'd get a nice early-ish lunch together, spend some time either on our balcony or on the pool deck (though this was often difficult due to crowds), then enjoy entertainment, food, and each other in the evenings. We thought Celebrity would be perfect for this, and with our son being young enough that the lack of more thrilling activities won't matter, we're just prepared to be flexible based on his needs. He's not very fussy, is used to going out to dinner with us (he's usually not loud or disruptive, and if he is, we just trade off exiting the restaurant and calming him). We also figure the perceived more calm atmosphere of Celebrity is a better fit for us as a family, and if he ever gets overwhelmed, we can just retreat to the cabin for a little bit.


Sorry for being long-winded, I've just seen some discourse on the above, and wanted to give my reasons for choosing Celebrity given our situation as parents. üôÇ",1,1742477344.0,celebritycruises,8,0.57,False

1jfotg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1jfotg8/feeling_torn_mentally_spiritually/,Feeling Torn Mentally & Spiritually...,"Hello.  Been married for over 20 years to my wife and have 4 wonderful children.  Right after temple marriage I went into the military and spent over 20 years; been retired 3 years; during that time in the military, between promotion, moves, college, working over 12 hrs., and trying to raise a family, I now have depression and anxiety--always had it, but my military career pushed myself and never doubted my abilities--had a very successful career and got my master's degree when I got out; now with retired pay.

  
When I retired from the military, I fell into deep depression and anxiety because I had more time in my hands. Tried hobbies and career change, but all along, growing apart from my family.  The military caused me to miss birthdays, and some special events; I love my wife and kiddos but don't feel close to them.  My father was never there for me and my mother was always working, mother always tending to my three sisters, connecting better with them since I was the only boy--resent that for a while, but I have forgiven her.  Life growing up wasn't easy, but promised never to do the same to my kiddos.  However, these last three years have been miserable for me; tried reconnecting with my wife and kiddos and it's like we grew apart.  My wife is perfect, she's kind and adores the kids.  I'm not at her level emotionally.  I don't feel we connect, though, because she has a hard time understanding why I can't move on from my military service.  I miss the service and being a top performer; I miss the accountability and rapid job pace.  I miss traveling and going places.  My wife is a home body; her depression meds don't give her enough energy and she spends whatever time she has on the kids or talking to her friends on the phone for hours.  When she hangs up, we try to talk but only for a few minutes because dinner or one of the kids needs something.

  
We tried dating, marriage counseling, and other things.  But I'm just not connecting and she doesn't get my current condition.  I am a 100% disabled veteran and get a second pension from that; able to work and move around; my conditions are more mental and have few surgeries due to running for over 20 years and exercise, plus the long hours drinking caffeine from soda products since I don't drink coffee as member of the church.  Never drank, smoked or did drugs due to my beliefs of the Savior--I love the church.    However, I feel I cannot continue like this; my medicines are holding me grounded, but some days are really rough.  Never cheated on my wife; however, I don't feel compatible to her; it breaks my heart that I either have to stay with our temple marriage or go.  I would support them financially without issues and would put all my kiddos through missions and college if they wanted, since I know that's what they want to do.  I am torn mentally and spiritually.  I would definitely would be in my kiddos lives more than my parents ever were, but I don't have the heart to tell my wife and kids that I will go crazy if I don't change my environment.

Any good advise is welcome.  Anyone out there feeling this way? Great job, family, more than stable finances, but have grown apart from spouse? Thank you.",4,1742477044.0,latterdaysaints,4,1.0,False

I'm getting into the world of sculpting because I'd like to make my own 54mm chess set. At the moment I'm just starting out, so I wanted to see if I'm headed in the right direction. 

- I want to start sculpting with super sculpy. I know there are a few different types, but I'd probably go with the medium firm grey clay. 
- I'll create the armatures out of tin foil. 
- I'll start by replicating a chess set I already have. 

I obviously understand this a long journey, but in terms of baby steps are there any specific must have tools I need at the beginning for sculpting or will basic sculpting tools do for now? 

Do you have any suggestions on choice of material? I prefer super sculpy because I'll have longer to work with it compared to magic sculpt or kneadelite. 

I've more or less figured out how to create the molds once I have the prototype. 

If anyone has ever done anything like this I'd love to chat to you. I'll throw in a coffee or two as well.

1jfooqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1jfooqk/lil_success_story_sp/,lil success story (sp),"hello lovelies! wanted to share my success story with you all to maybe give some motivation for anyone struggling! 

little bit of context - we dated for a year and moved very quickly. january of this year we separated and officially broke it off 15th feb. we reconnected less than a month later on his birthday. we were still in friendly contact during these times so bare that in mind, but there was a 3P that i had to deal with during this time. 

so we had a lovely relationship to begin with and then had some struggles towards the end which led to us separating for a month and then officially breaking up as we both needed some time to work on our own things. during this time, i struggled to hell for the first month and a bit as i was placing him on the pedestal and acting like i needed him to be okay. around the end of feb, once id realised that feeling sad about it was okay and that i can get what i want as it‚Äôs my reality, i buckled down hard with manifesting. main techniques were scripting when the 3D was kicking my butt in regards to 3P and the distance, so i would script him being amazing and so in love and robotically affirming every chance i got when i was doing something mindless like travelling on the bus or cleaning something. i also fell down the rabbit hole of watching basically everything LOA on youtube and honestly hearing other success stories and some tough loving from Sammy Ingram made everything click and allow me to fully persist. 

fast forward to his birthday, i realised that i am actually that girl and able to get what i want by minimally working on self concept and mainly healing my attachment style (anxious girlie here) and he repeated basically everything back to me - that he‚Äôs obsessed with me (healthily don‚Äôt worry), he misses our relationship and that he wants to try again and work on things as im the only person for him (again another one of my affirmations). ever since it‚Äôs been so wonderful, he‚Äôs been attentive and caring and loving and committed to making things work. but even when i saw this movement, i never stopped affirming to keep my subconscious more impressed by the current reality and my end goal. 

hopefully a little success will make people feel more confident in being able to manifest what they want too - when i was struggling to believe i would manifest a little thing like a free coffee or finding something id lost to prove i was capable of it. ",7,1742476647.0,lawofassumption,8,1.0,False

But there‚Äôs something different about my roommate, Luke. It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs strange in the way that most roommates are. No, it‚Äôs something else entirely.

It all began on a lazy Saturday morning. I was sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone, trying to decide what to do on my day off. My eyes flicked to the kitchen, where Luke was preparing breakfast. He had his usual routine, crack an egg, scramble it, throw in a slice of bread, and make a weird, mashed-up sandwich. He always did this in a way that made it seem as though he was performing some culinary masterpiece.

But then, something unusual happened.

‚ÄúLuke is walking in the kitchen,‚Äù he muttered, as if someone else were in the room, narrating the scene. He didn‚Äôt even seem to notice. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs stepping lightly, trying not to make noise on the creaky floorboards. The smell of coffee wafts through the air as he opens the cabinet.‚Äù

I blinked, not sure if I had heard him correctly. I glanced over at him. He was still moving around, completely absorbed in what he was doing. His voice continued, almost casually. 

‚ÄúThe cereal box is knocked over by his elbow as he reaches for the mug. He‚Äôs beginning to wonder if he should put the cereal back in the pantry or leave it out for later.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking through the strange moment, ‚Äúare you like.. talking to yourself?‚Äù

He stopped mid-motion, glancing at me with wide eyes, as if I had just spoken a foreign language. ‚ÄúWhat? No, I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ Wait, what do you mean?‚Äù He paused and shook his head. 

I stared at him for a second, trying to process what just happened. Was he narrating himself? Was that a thing he did? He seemed confused, but it wasn‚Äôt like he had noticed anything off.

I decided to brush it off. Maybe he was just in a weird mood, or maybe he was messing with me. We all have our moments. I turned back to my phone and ignored him. After a few minutes, the narration started again, this time it was about a completely random event.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sitting down now. The chair is a bit too squeaky, but it‚Äôs nothing new,‚Äù Luke‚Äôs voice drifted through the air again. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs reaching for the remote, and his hand hovers just over the surface of the table. Watch it Luke! Don't spill your drink.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. It was like he was acting out a scene in a movie, but the odd thing was that he had no idea he was doing it. He wasn‚Äôt narrating for me, or anyone, just himself.

That was the first time I noticed it, but it wasn‚Äôt the last.

The following day, I was sitting on the couch, trying to get some work done on my computer. Luke had his headphones on, blasting music as he usually did. He was working on the online degree he had been pursuing for 5 years now. But today, he wasn‚Äôt just listening to music. He was narrating every single movement as if it were the most important thing happening.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sitting at his desk now, feeling the weight of his eyes on the screen,‚Äù Luke murmured. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wondering if he‚Äôs doing it right. His fingers hover over the keyboard, and the click of each key makes him feel like he's not achieving enough.‚Äù

It was getting harder to ignore. I shifted in my chair, uncomfortable. I tried to focus on my work, but Luke‚Äôs voice, low and rhythmic, kept breaking through my thoughts. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs squinting at the screen now. His eyelids are heavy, his concentration faltering. He‚Äôs been at this for an hour and he‚Äôs beginning to regret his decision to start so late.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke,‚Äù I finally said, ‚Äúare you, uh, okay buddy?‚Äù

His head jerked toward me in surprise. He took out his headphones, blinking at me like I was speaking in riddles. ‚ÄúWhat? What do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still narrating everything you're doing,‚Äù I said, unable to stop the slight frustration in my voice.

Luke blinked a few times, processing the words. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? I‚Äôm not doing that.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre starting to worry me dude,‚Äù he said.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. He seemed genuinely confused. I just nodded, though I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right.

Days went on. At first, it was small things. The way he narrated getting a glass of water.

‚ÄúLuke reaches for the cold glass, his fingers brushing the condensation on the outside. He brings it to his lips, feeling the cool liquid slide down his throat.‚Äù 

And the random moments where he‚Äôd walk around the apartment, his voice narrating everything from the sound of his footsteps on the hardwood floor to the way the air felt when he opened the window.

It was starting to get unsettling. Each day, the narrations grew more specific, more detailed. Luke would describe not only what he was doing but how he was feeling.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs feeling a bit annoyed now. It‚Äôs that same nagging irritation that‚Äôs been creeping up on him for days,‚Äù I heard him mutter one evening as he walked into the bathroom. ‚ÄúThe faucet is running a bit too loud, and it‚Äôs making him anxious. He can‚Äôt shake it.‚Äù

It was odd. At first, I figured it was just a weird quirk. But soon, it felt more like something was seriously wrong.

I tried to confront him a few more times, but each time, he had no memory of saying anything out loud. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing that,‚Äù he‚Äôd insist. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what you mean.‚Äù

One day, I had enough. He was standing in the kitchen, the smell of burnt toast filling the apartment, as he was narrating his breakfast like it was an epic tale.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs making toast now, but wait! Something‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù Luke said. ‚ÄúThe bread is burning, but he‚Äôs too slow to stop it. He‚Äôs getting frustrated! But he won‚Äôt admit it. The charred smell fills the air, but he‚Äôs ignoring it. He always does that..‚Äù

I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. ‚ÄúLuke! What the hell are you doing?!‚Äù

Luke stopped mid-bite, looking at me with confusion, the crumbs of burnt toast falling from his lips. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you still fucking narrating everything you do?‚Äù I asked, my hands gripping the edge of the counter. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing that?‚Äù

He looked even more bewildered than usual. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not narrating anything. You‚Äôre crazy.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when I started to get a little nervous. I watched him with a growing sense of dread, unsure of what was happening. The next day, I was in my room when I heard something, muffled, like he was talking to himself again.

I leaned in, trying to catch the words. I could barely make it out.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs becoming... too much. I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. It‚Äôs driving me crazy. I‚Äôll have to do something soon.‚Äù

The words sent a shiver down my spine. I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was still narrating his own actions or if something darker was creeping into his thoughts.

Things went downhill after that. The narrations became more sinister. Luke would say things when I walk by, like, ‚ÄúLook at him.. so smug. He doesn‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm planning..‚Äù

I could hear him whispering to himself at night, his voice low and unsettling. ‚ÄúThe time is coming. He won‚Äôt see it coming.‚Äù

For the next few days, everything seemed oddly‚Ä¶ normal. Luke continued narrating every little detail of his life, but the darker tone seemed to fade, replaced by the mundane once again. It was as if everything had returned to a comfortable, albeit strange, routine. The narrations didn‚Äôt have that ominous edge anymore. He was back to describing simple things like the weather, his meals, or the way he brushed his teeth.

‚ÄúLuke picks up his toothbrush, the bristles soft against his gums,‚Äù he muttered one morning as he prepared for work. ‚ÄúHe wonders if he‚Äôs brushing long enough, but decides it doesn‚Äôt really matter. It‚Äôs just another part of the morning routine.‚Äù

It was strange, but there was something almost comforting about it. No more veiled threats. No more murmurs about his plans for me. It felt like things were going back to normal. For a moment, I allowed myself to breathe a little easier.

But something didn‚Äôt sit right with me. The idea that Luke had no idea he was narrating his own life, no awareness of it at all, made me worried for his health. Something was obviously off. So, I decided it was time for a talk.

I had to get through to him. He needed help. He needed to realize what was happening. This had gone on long enough. I couldn‚Äôt just pretend like everything was okay when clearly something wasn‚Äôt. It was all too bizarre to just keep ignoring.

I waited for a quiet evening. When Luke came into the living room and sat down on the couch, I knew it was the right time. I could tell by the distant look in his eyes that something was still... off.

‚ÄúLuke, we need to talk,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice calm. My hands were trembling slightly, but I couldn‚Äôt let him see that. This had to be a conversation about the future, not about fear.

He looked at me, his face unreadable, but then he did that thing again. That thing where he started speaking in that low, almost absent tone, as though narrating his own internal thoughts in real-time.

‚ÄúLuke sits down on the couch, his body relaxed but his mind already elsewhere. He feels the weight of his roommate's words coming, the tension building in the air between them.‚Äù

I froze for a second, feeling a cold chill crawl down my spine. He was narrating this, right now, while I was speaking to him. My pulse quickened, and I swallowed hard, forcing myself to continue.

‚ÄúLuke,‚Äù I said, taking a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ narrating everything you do, everything you feel. I don‚Äôt think you realize it, but it‚Äôs starting to become really concerning. You need to get help, Luke. This isn‚Äôt normal.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly, blinking at me as though he were confused by my words, but at the same time, he didn‚Äôt stop narrating.

‚ÄúLuke listens to his roommate, trying to focus, but something about the way he‚Äôs talking is starting to make him angry. It‚Äôs the same thing over and over, like Luke‚Äôs life is a problem to be fixed. But Luke knows better. He knows that his roommate doesn‚Äôt understand. He never has. He never will.‚Äù

The cold feeling in my stomach grew. I didn‚Äôt know how to react to him saying these things in front of me, out loud, as if he were having a conversation with himself.

‚ÄúLuke doesn‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs so angry. His roommate is just trying to help. It should be easy, right? Just listen, agree, and everything will be fine. But it‚Äôs not that simple. It never was. Luke‚Äôs thoughts race faster now, but he knows he must keep it together. For now.‚Äù

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out at first. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still narrating everything, Luke.. like literally.. right now,‚Äù I pressed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing it for weeks now, and it‚Äôs not just harmless commentary. It‚Äôs getting.. ‚Äù I searched for the right words, ‚Äú.. it‚Äôs getting dangerous. It‚Äôs not healthy. I‚Äôm worried about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke is hearing the words, but they‚Äôre slipping past him. He can‚Äôt stop thinking about how this conversation feels. Why is his roommate acting like this? Why is he making him feel like this? Doesn‚Äôt he get it? Luke doesn‚Äôt need help. Luke doesn‚Äôt need to change. *He‚Äôs* not the problem.‚Äù

I felt my chest tighten. ‚ÄúLuke, please, listen to me. You‚Äôre not okay. This isn‚Äôt normal. I‚Äôm not trying to attack you, I just‚Ä¶ I want you to get help. I want you to be okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke watches his roommate, sees the frustration, the concern etched on his face. It‚Äôs almost laughable. Doesn‚Äôt he see? Doesn‚Äôt he get it? *He* is the problem. Luke is done with his opinions. It‚Äôs time to act, time to fix this once and for all.‚Äù

I could hear the agitation in his voice. His tone had changed, gone darker. His words were louder now, more insistent.

‚ÄúLuke feels his anger bubbling to the surface. He just keeps repeating the same thing over and over. But it‚Äôs getting under his skin. He can feel it. The irritation.. like a tickle in the back of his throat. But then it grows. It swells. He wants to scream.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke,‚Äù I started again, my voice trembling now, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt you. I know you‚Äôre upset, but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke can‚Äôt take it anymore. The words are too much. The pestering is too much. Maybe if he makes it stop, it‚Äôll be over. If he gets rid of the problem.. everything will be okay.‚Äù

I stepped back, my heart pounding in my chest. ‚ÄúLuke, stop. I‚Äôm begging you to listen to me.‚Äù

But Luke didn‚Äôt hear me. He was too far gone, lost in the voice inside his head that was narrating, controlling him.

‚ÄúLuke‚Äôs body tenses. He feels his hands shaking, the nervous energy building. The anger is making him feel stronger. He doesn‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs help. He doesn‚Äôt need anyone.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. The fear gripped me. It was like I was watching a different version of Luke, one that was shifting in front of me, changing into someone I didn‚Äôt recognize. He looked like a madman.

I took a step back. I knew I needed to get out of there. My mind was racing, and everything seemed to blur together.

‚ÄúLuke‚Äôs roommate is weak. That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs been thinking this whole time. He‚Äôs weak.‚Äù

Luke stopped narrating suddenly, his eyes snapping up to meet mine. There was no fear, no recognition. Just cold, calculated anger.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the one who needs help, you know,‚Äù he muttered, his voice thick with resentment.

I began to back away, my mouth opening to speak. Luke stood up abruptly, cutting me off mid-sentence. I blinked, startled by his sudden movement. There was no warning, just that eerie silence in the room after his last, chilling words. He began to slowly walk backwards into the kitchen, eyes still locked on mine. 

‚ÄúLuke stands, his body stiff but his mind already elsewhere, consumed with thoughts he can‚Äôt stop, thoughts that are louder than his roommate‚Äôs voice. He moves toward the kitchen, feeling the coldness of the floor beneath his bare feet. He wonders if his roommate is still talking, still trying to convince him of something that doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù

I froze, hearing the words echo in my head. Luke wasn‚Äôt even acknowledging me now, just moving in a trance-like state as his voice narrated his own every move.

I was paralyzed. I watched him step into the kitchen, his footsteps barely audible in the silence of the apartment. His actions were precise, measured, like he was following a script only he could hear.

‚ÄúLuke opens the fridge, the cold air hitting his face. He grabs a carton of milk, not because he‚Äôs thirsty, but because it‚Äôs an action to fill the void, a distraction. He wonders if the milk will be sour, but shrugs. He‚Äôll deal with that later.‚Äù

I could feel my heart hammering in my chest. I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt speak. I was paralyzed by the strangeness of what was happening. What was he doing?

‚ÄúLuke places the milk back in the fridge.‚Äù

His movements were so ordinary, so mundane. It wasn‚Äôt just the narration that unnerved me; it was the quiet way he was moving. The deliberate, slow pace. 

‚ÄúLuke turns his attention to the knife block on the counter. He looks at the knives, fingers brushing lightly over the cool metal, contemplating. He feels something stir inside him, something dark. A sense of power, of control. He doesn‚Äôt feel scared anymore. He doesn‚Äôt feel lost. He feels focused, determined.‚Äù

I could hear the distinct sound of metal scraping against wood as Luke slowly slid the largest knife from the block. My blood ran cold.

‚ÄúLuke grips the knife tightly, the cool handle pressing against his palm. The weight of it is comforting. He looks at the blade, not with fear, but with a sense of purpose.‚Äù

My legs felt frozen in place, but my eyes were looking toward the front door. I wanted to leave, but fear had me planted there, panic rising in my throat. ‚ÄúLuke!‚Äù I called, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúW.. What are you doing?!‚Äù

But Luke didn‚Äôt respond. Instead, he continued with his narration, like I wasn‚Äôt even there.

‚ÄúLuke walks back into the living room, holding the knife in his hand. His thoughts swirl around him, chaotic and sharp, like the blade in his grasp. He wonders if his roommate knows what‚Äôs coming, if he‚Äôs figured it out yet. But he‚Äôs not sure it matters. It‚Äôs too late now.‚Äù

His words made it worse, made everything feel so deliberate, like he was living out some twisted script. His voice was so cold, detached.

‚ÄúLuke stops in front of his roommate, the knife heavy in his hand, but there‚Äôs no fear in his heart. He‚Äôs calm, collected. He‚Äôs at peace with the anger. It‚Äôs been building for so long. This is the only way to make it all stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke, no‚Äù I stammered, my voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúPlease, put the knife down.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond, just stood there, his gaze cold and distant. His voice continued, narrating his thoughts as if we were in two different realities.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, trying to think. This wasn‚Äôt the Luke I knew. This wasn‚Äôt the guy who would have ever even considered doing something like this. Something had changed, something inside him was breaking apart, unraveling in front of me.

I couldn‚Äôt just stand there. I couldn‚Äôt let him do whatever he was planning. The air between us felt thick, heavy with tension. My mind raced, looking for a way out, a way to make sense of this, but I couldn‚Äôt think straight. I needed to get the knife away from him, somehow.

I took a cautious step forward. ‚ÄúLuke, you don‚Äôt need to do this,‚Äù I pleaded, my voice hoarse. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ just talk to me. Let‚Äôs work this out. We can figure this out.‚Äù

‚ÄúLuke isn‚Äôt listening. He feels something snap inside him. He‚Äôs done with words, done with this. It‚Äôs time to end it. To silence him once and for all.‚Äù

Luke lunged forward before I could move. I tried grabbing his wrist, trying to pull the knife from his hand. His grip was strong, unyielding. There was something dark in his eyes, something that didn‚Äôt belong.

The world around me seemed to blur into a tunnel as my heart hammered in my chest, adrenaline flooding my system. I kept pulling, my breath shallow and frantic.

And then, in one sudden motion, I snapped out of it. Every instinct screaming at me to run. I broke free from the struggle and bolted for the door.

‚ÄúLuke watches as his roommate turns and runs, a sense of satisfaction creeping up his spine. His steps are slow but deliberate, knowing that it‚Äôs too late to escape.‚Äù

I could hear Luke behind me, his footsteps barely audible at first, but they were there, following me, echoing in the quiet apartment. I didn‚Äôt dare look back, just kept pushing forward, my hands frantically grabbing for the door handle.

The cool metal of the knob was slick with sweat as I wrenched the door open, stumbling out into the hallway.

*Snap*.

The pain hit me hard, sharp and searing, as if someone had shoved a hot iron into my back. My breath left me in a violent gasp. I didn‚Äôt stop. I couldn‚Äôt stop.

I was halfway down the stairs when I heard Luke‚Äôs voice, quiet and detached, like he wasn‚Äôt even speaking to me anymore.

‚ÄúLuke doesn‚Äôt need to chase anymore. He‚Äôs already won.‚Äù

The words echoed in my ears, fueling my panic. I could hear him behind me, I could feel him gaining on me. The cold wind whipped against my skin, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to clear the fog of fear clouding my mind. I had to get away, had to keep running.

I burst out into the street, the night air cold against my back, now pouring with blood. The bright streetlights flickered overhead. The distant hum of cars, the occasional shout of a pedestrian, it was all a blur as I sprinted down the block. My legs ached, my heart hammering in my chest like a drum. Every step felt like it might be my last.

But I didn‚Äôt dare look back. I kept running, my feet pounding against the pavement, the knife wound throbbing with each step, the blood soaking through my clothes. The pain was unbearable, but it didn‚Äôt matter.

I just needed to get away.

The corner store came into view, a neon light glowing faintly in the distance. I pushed myself harder, the door to the convenience store just within reach.

My hands were slick, shaking as I grabbed the door handle and yanked it open. The bell above the door rang loudly, a harsh contrast to the silence of the night. I didn‚Äôt pause to explain myself. I rushed past the counter, my back to the clerk who stood frozen, eyes wide in confusion.

‚ÄúCall the police,‚Äù I gasped, my voice barely audible over the pounding in my ears. ‚ÄúPlease. Call the police.‚Äù

The clerk‚Äôs mouth moved, but the words didn‚Äôt register. I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything except the pain, the fear, and the knowledge that Luke was still out there.

The next few minutes were a blur of movement, the store clerk picking up the phone, the sirens in the distance growing louder. I collapsed to the ground, coming in and out of consciousness. The blood oozed through my clothes, getting on everything around me.

The world slipped away as I heard the faint sound of police cars approaching.

When the police went back to the apartment, Luke was gone. The doctors say I will make a mostly full recovery, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever really be the same. 

This morning, I woke up to the steady beep of a heart monitor and the antiseptic sting of a hospital room. My back aches like hell. For a moment, everything was a blur. But then it all came rushing back.

Luke.

I try to sit up, but pain lances through my back, forcing me back down. A nurse notices and rushes over, placing a hand on my shoulder.

""Easy now,"" she said with a soft smile. ""You've been through a lot.""

My throat was dry. ""Luke,"" I croak out. ""Did they find Luke yet?""

The nurse‚Äôs smile falters just a bit, but she covers it quickly. ""You should rest. I‚Äôm sure the police will come by later to talk.""

She adjusts my IV, humming softly under her breath, and just as she‚Äôs about to leave, she pauses at the door.

""You know, you‚Äôve been doing this funny thing,"" she says, her voice light, casual. ""You‚Äôve been sitting up in bed and talking. Having whole conversations. But when we come in, you stop.‚Äù

My skin prickles.

""What do I say?"" I whisper.

She shrugs. ""Hard to tell. Mostly just one side of a conversation. It‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre narrating a movie or something.""

A cold weight settles in my stomach.

I don‚Äôt remember doing that.

Before I can respond, she gives me one last polite smile and walks out, leaving me alone with the rhythmic beep of the monitor and a million questions.

Ive been working security at this construction site for almost a year. Another month and It‚Äôll be a review , and God willing a raise. I‚Äôm really tired of eating lukewarm noodles for lunch. Other than meager pay in an abysmal economy, the situations been great, until things got weird. I suppose now that‚Äôs the least of my problems 

I first got on around the middle of the month. The job entails sitting around in a metal box to watch over a half built construction site. It‚Äôs supposed to be the biggest project in North America so I keep an eye out for drunk teenagers and addicts looking for copper. Miles of prefabricated steel, Rebar and concrete. Giant slabs of Half made buildings cut through the night air. LED lampposts pepper the place throughout, Illuminating everything in that pale, artificial glow that lines the highways across the country. You know there must dozens of people making rounds or burning the night oil. Still being out there in the darkness makes you feel vulnerable.

On the record, what I do is stand at the ready , clip board in hand, and call the cops if whoever i ask to leave, doesn‚Äôt. In practice I stare off into the dark, doom scrolling Reddit and TikTok. One eye on my phone and the other looking for my boss. If you get caught sleeping you‚Äôre fired of course but anything you do to stay awake is gravy.

The first time it happened was my phone died. I was watching some goth chick dance in a video that if caught I don't think would get me canned, but definitely would have raised an eyebrow. I didn‚Äôt notice when halfway through a swipe i wound up looking at a black mirror.   Muttering I tossed the phone on the folding chair i use as a table. Great. I even forgot my charger. Hours I now spent just staring at the dark, waiting to be relieved. Only thing I could do is ignore the nagging thoughts in my head that I failed at life. Trade school would have been better than dropping out of college knee deep in debt. It was then looking at the horizon of supposedly empty towers, something moved.

I squinted at the horizon. Something massive crept between the giant metal beams. The braces to future walls were stories high. Whatever it was breaking the light between them, it must have been massive. 

‚ÄúIs that a crane?‚Äù I leaned closer as if that would somehow help. It didn't move again but i swear the lighting was different. Some giant black shadow towered among the shambles of buildings yet to be. I thought I was going mad when the thought crept in that it somehow looked, human.

The window of my cell flickered with the approach of yellow headlights. My replacement moseyed over in a white pickup truck to start the shift. A man in safety yellow hopped out covered in fake badges and the word Security blazoned over everything. I think a clown costume would have been less embarrassing. I couldn‚Äôt mock him though. After all, I was wearing the same thing. 

I handed over the clip board covered in scribbles. Accounting for who checked on me, who I turned away and when. As he signed for ownership of the thing I asked him. ‚ÄúDid the company start doing night construction?‚Äù

‚ÄúNone that I know of.‚Äù He shook his head in response. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt surprise me though.‚Äù Every day this thing isn‚Äôt built costs these guys money.‚Äù

I told him the parts that didn't make me sound like a loony and he laughed at me. ‚ÄúSounds like your getting tired. You doing okay out here? ‚Äú 

I laughed it off and thought nothing of it until tomorrow. 

A man died on the construction site, crushed by a fallen beam. 

The legal fanfare was long over by the time I returned. Even then the rumor mill was abuzz. I hadn‚Äôt stepped foot in the briefing room before I heard two people talking about it outside. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe something that big would have failed like that.‚Äù Somebody in a turtleneck on the accounting side mumbled through a turkey sandwich. ‚ÄúI bet the safety guys fuming.‚Äù 

He was. I saw him yelling at his phone through a mix of about three languages. Every phone he owned in his office vibrating with loaded questions demanding answers. He gave me one look and swore as he shut the door. No one could have seen it coming. Rumor was a manufacturing error in the connection caused a beam to drop, crushing some poor guy all the way from Honduras there to build the thing.

There was no way what I saw was connected. At least that was what I told myself. I popped a nicotine pouch in my lip and drank my coke. Id salivate over Pretty women another time. I knew security would be tight.

I was right. The rovers came by twice as often. Doing in shack inspections telling me to sweep up non existent dirt. Everyone was on edge since the death. Emergencies like this meant corporate and everyone was afraid of a cull. Unemployment in America is like pulling teeth from an angry dog. You‚Äôre just going to leave in worse shape then you came. That meant everyone was in full CYA mode to make sure they didn't lose their job. I even had a manager come in to watch me as I worked.

Bill was an alright sort. He smoked like a chimney but so did my dad. At ten dollars a pack I wondered how either of them could afford it but old Habits die hard. Everyone else was shook like a jumping bean but that old man stayed cool. Hardly raised an eyebrow or said a word as we watched a dead horizon. Cars on the freeway would pass and that distant whoosh was the only thing that broke the silence until finally he spoke.

‚ÄúSo, Marty told me you saw something.‚Äù He leaned back in his folding chair, balancing on the rear legs with an effortless ease.

I shrugged, looking out the window and told him what i told Marty. ‚ÄúSome shadows over the Horizon. Must have been getting tired.‚Äù

He poked at his pack with a non chalance as he continued. ‚ÄúWhat else did you see?‚Äù

I froze like a kid caught in a cookie jar. My reaction told him what he wanted to know because he chuckled to himself as he put his chair back on all fours. He pulled a smoke out and nodded to the window. ‚ÄúOpen it.‚Äù

I did as he asked. I knew it was grounds for termination for us both but looking at him it just seemed the right thing to do. He leaned forward, lit his cigarette, and took a deep breath to sigh. Whole thing looked like a confession at an AA meeting as he started. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been at this job for a over a decade. Company‚Äôs had me watch over the construction of two oil rigs, a lumber mill. A state prison and now here. When you work nights alone out here you‚Äôll see some things. Some say it‚Äôs tricks but I think there‚Äôs more to it than that. Little things like to flicker along the darkness. Places we weren‚Äôt supposed to go. The junkies will see them. Shadows moving around in outlines of people. Most think they‚Äôre just high and off their rocker but i don't think you are using any help staying up. Usually it‚Äôs nothing, just little ones. Its the big one you have to worry about.‚Äù

I didn't say a word. I swear that man could read faces like a thrift store book cuz He didnt ask a thing. Just took a drag, beard stained yellow from years of tar and coffee. 

‚ÄúI dont imagine those schools teach you much about what an Omen is. Suffice it say, the big one is usually a sign of something. Something bad. Ive seen him twice over the years.  Both times something terrible happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù I asked him as gooseflesh ran up my arms. The whole situation just felt surreal. 

‚ÄúNothing you can do.‚Äù He shook His head and smoked some more. ‚ÄúNo one to tell and no one would believe you. Just keep your head down, mouth shut, and whatever you do, pray that thing doesn‚Äôt see you.‚Äù

He finished his smoke and things went back to normal. He told me about his kids or what he could remember of them. Wife took them and ran years ago so he hadn‚Äôt seen them since. Never got married again because why bother?  Said he lost enough for one life. Hours passed and when someone came to relieve us, he stepped in his truck to leave. The door opened showing two MRE‚Äôs and a blanket in his cab. I would have thought he slept in the thing were it not for the hotel provisions to travel. Between projects he probably did.

‚ÄúYou remember what I told you. It ain‚Äôt your fault, and it sure as heck ain‚Äôt your business.‚Äú With that he pulled off the lot and drove away.

Weeks passed and nothing changed. More workers, more scanned badges , and more flicking my thumb to an endless river of content. The buzz about the death died down and surprise inspections were all but forgotten. The nail in the coffin was the suits coming in. A bunch of people whose face I only recognize from plaques on a wall gave a half hearted speech full of buzzwords and somehow people knew things were done. The lip service was paid, serfs go back to work.

I thought nothing of it. Just tried to keep my head down like I was told. If there wasn't a catastrophe at work or a bill in default, there was something on the news telling me I was about to die. No difference I can make. Just leave me to my life of quiet desperation. 

That was until it happened again. I looked out at a night like any other in the last week. It was pouring rain and my service was acting up when I saw that giant thing again. A shadow stories tall flashed over the flood lights and hovered over Transformers built on post. The move was slow and deliberate, same rhythm as the cars on the horizon. Any slower I wouldn‚Äôt have caught it but the thing was there. Like some crane perched over the building with a strand of lowered cargo. The closer i looked however, the more saw a pair of arms. 

A flash flood happened two days later. Transformer blew and ten men were electrocuted. None survived. 

This time the government got involved. Police, Reporters, anything you could think of. I was Given a business card to our media rep and told not to open my mouth for anyone. I didn‚Äôt know what i could say, so I did as I was told. Walking into the skirted trailer we used as a meeting site, I locked eyes with Bill. A solemn nod from tired eyes. We both knew plenty without a word between us. A horrible truth and no one there to tell. 

I still would have kept it to myself. Would have called myself a nut and tried to forget. Over the months I almost did. But now I know what it looks like. A giant shadow, looming over the night, hands grasping for anything it can drag back to the dark. It‚Äôs skull looming over ribs of rebar and iron. Eyes cold glow of a pair of lamp posts in the distance. A death trap waiting to fall on another mouse. 

It‚Äôs been hugging the nuclear silo here for a week, and every day its been looking right at me.

One thing is for certain: If it isn‚Äôt ORGANIC coffee, your coffee is toxic.  In non-organic coffees, a chemical called ACRYLAMIDE is formed during the roasting process and could be linked to cancer. 

What is Acrylamide? A compound created when coffee beans are roasted at high temperatures, and studies in animals have shown that high levels of acrylamide can cause cancer.

I sat there staring at the picture my mother showed me‚Äîa little boy with my eyes and my mother‚Äôs nose. My son.

I didn‚Äôt know what to feel. My heart ached with love for a child I had never met, but my mind was racing with betrayal. Had Hannah moved on too fast? Had Mark‚Äîmy best friend‚Äîbeen waiting for me to disappear? Did they ever try to find out the truth?

I had so many questions, but my parents kept insisting that I take things slow. They reminded me that for everyone else, I had been dead for years. That Hannah had grieved, that Mark had ‚Äústepped up,‚Äù and that my son had never even heard my name.

I wasn‚Äôt ready to accept that. I needed to see them.

The First Meeting

I drove to their house‚Äîa place that should have been mine. It was surreal standing across the street, looking at a life that had continued without me. The front yard was filled with toys, and then I saw him. My son. He was running across the grass, laughing.

And then I saw Hannah. She looked older, more tired, but still beautiful. And Mark‚Ä¶ Mark was there too, stepping onto the porch with a coffee in hand, smiling like he had won the life that was supposed to be mine.

I don‚Äôt remember making the decision to walk up to the door. My body moved on its own. My hands were shaking as I knocked.

Hannah opened it.

She went pale. Her hand flew to her mouth. And then, without a single word, she fainted.

Mark rushed over, catching her before she hit the floor, but when his eyes met mine, his entire body went rigid. His face turned white as a sheet.

‚ÄúJames?‚Äù His voice was barely above a whisper.

I just stared at him. At the man who had married my wife. At the man who might have raised my son.

And then, the front door creaked open wider, and a small voice asked, ‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

Mark turned, but my eyes were locked on the little boy standing there, looking up at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My chest felt like it was going to explode.

‚ÄúJames, you need to leave,‚Äù Mark said, stepping in front of me.

But I wasn‚Äôt leaving. Not this time.

1jfogko,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfogko,Is Tokyo Starbucks Roastery‚Äôs cherry blossom terrace picnic plan worth the 8000 yen? A review,"Hey guys. About a week ago, I advised someone visiting Tokyo that getting Roastery TN merch would be ‚Äúa sure thing‚Äù if they reserved the Starbucks cherry blossom terrace picnic plan and they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about fighting the reservation system a day before or morning of the day they want to go.

I thought I‚Äôd try it out myself and replenish my Roastery stock before cherry blossom season gets crazy.

A couple of things.

Yes, it is a sure thing that you can get TN merch. I did as soon as I went in. You can tell the person at the door that you have a terrace reservation and go in 30 minutes before your reservation slot, and you can visit the gift section at any time during your slot. You can also visit the dessert section etc. 

Is it worth shelling out for the 8000-yen plan? Depends. If you have a set tourism itinerary and want to be guaranteed access to the Roastery during cherry blossom season at a certain time to get TN merch, probably. For the snack box and blanket, definitely not. For the Tokyo experience of a seat next to cherry blossoms for a Starbucks or coffee fan, definitely yes.

This is not like a normal Starbucks. Expect to shell out some money here. I had the 8000 yen reservation but also spent another 10000 yen on TN merch and maybe another 2000 yen on extra desserts and coffee. Treat it as another Tokyo experience like Team Labs or Ghibli museum or whatever.

1. Ease of reservation

This was disadvantageous for me. I was only one person and the tables were for up to four people, so they limit these slots. They want 24000 yen for that space, not 8000. Youll have more luck booking 2-4 people. There are also more slots on weeknights right now because Japanese people aren‚Äôt going to be drinking coffee at 8 pm on a weeknight. 

2. The view

It was great!!!! There‚Äôs no cherry blossoms blooming right now but I live here so I don‚Äôt mind. It will look gorgeous in about a week or so. You are right above the river overlooking the trees. You don‚Äôt get to choose your seat but even if you don‚Äôt get a riverside seat, you can still see it and take pictures. It had a nice nighttime ambience.

3. The snack box

Not gonna lie, it sucked for the price. It didn‚Äôt even have any of the signature cherry blossom desserts in it, which I had to buy separately, so the things in my picture aren‚Äôt even part of the 8000 yen set. I would‚Äôve been pissed if I was looking at this as a food course experience and not a cherry blossom view experience. They did have a selection of special coffee and tea but I chose ‚Äúdecaf whatever‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt want to be up all night. 

4. The gift blanket

SOFT. SO SOFT. AND WARM. Again not worth 8000 yen but it really helped with the night chill and would make a cute souvenir. It has a sketch of the Roastery on it and as far as I know, they can only be obtained from special seasonal plans like this so it‚Äôs kinda limited edition. Would be nice for the plane home or an office. 

5. Enforcement of rules 

They were really on it. They had two people guarding the door to the terrace and you weren‚Äôt allowed in without a pink wristband. They kicked sneaky tourists out three times during my slot. However, they did take away the signs at around 20:00 but it might be because there weren‚Äôt many people yet. I think they‚Äôll be stricter during peak cherry blossoms. 

One thing I will note is that they do have a sign on the third floor that says how many slots are still available. Theoretically, you could probably tell the front door person you are there for the terrace, go to the third floor and check the slots, and if there aren‚Äôt slots then just get TN stuff and leave (but that‚Äôs shady and I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll be more vigilant during peak, maybe ask to show a reservation email)

6. Night slot

It was a bit chilly, but they do have outdoor heaters. And the blanket. And hot coffee. My slot ended at 20:30 but they came over and said I could stay till 22:00 if I wanted because there weren‚Äôt any people waiting for a table. Again, might be different during peak. My hands were a bit cold but I milked my time there with my little blanket and my book and stayed till closing.

I also need some advice about my colleague. I‚Äôm a F28 and the guy is 35. We used to be good friends, eating out with other friends, having coffee, and bonding.

In the beginning, there were only the two of us doing most of the paperwork in the officers. But eventually, I noticed others weren‚Äôt contributing, and it made me lose motivation. However, he kept working hard, continuing with the paperwork even though it wasn‚Äôt assigned to him by the president, who didn‚Äôt seem aware of the situation. One day, I was surprised to find that he had made several changes, like modifying the logo I created for the letterhead.

What I meant was it would‚Äôve been better if he had told me sooner that he didn‚Äôt agree with my design, so we wouldn‚Äôt have used it in public posts. I feel like every suggestion we make is always considered wrong, and he thinks he's the only one who's always right. He wants all of his ideas to be the ones that are implemented.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there often is, because it seems like he‚Äôs doing it for his own self-interest.

[Listen! My beloved approaches. Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills. ‚Äî Song 2:8 \(BSB\)](https://preview.redd.it/ff0vh9bfbupe1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb121d80d0b1b4e5463f692db7f29634348a04cc)

This was a precious name that the ancient Church often used to describe the Lord‚Äôs Anointed in her most joyful moments. When the time for singing came, and the voice of the dove was heard in the land, her love song was sweeter than anything as she sang, ‚ÄúMy beloved is mine and I am His!‚Äù Always, in her greatest songs, she called Him by that beautiful name, ‚ÄúMy beloved!‚Äù Even in the long winter, when idolatry had devastated the Lord‚Äôs garden, her prophets still found time to set aside their burdens for a moment, saying, like Elijah, ‚ÄúNow I will sing to my well-beloved, a song of my beloved.‚Äù Even though the saints hadn‚Äôt seen His face yet, even though He hadn‚Äôt come in the flesh to live among us or reveal His glory, He was still the consolation of Israel, the hope and joy of all the chosen, the ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù of all who were faithful before the Most High God.

Today, in the summer days of the Church, we also call Christ the beloved of our souls and know that He is precious, the ‚Äúchief among ten thousand, and the altogether lovely one.‚Äù The Church‚Äôs love for Jesus is so deep that the apostle boldly dares the universe to separate her from His love. He declares that neither persecution, distress, affliction, danger, or the sword can do it! He joyfully proclaims, ‚ÄúIn all these things‚Äîwe are more than conquerors through Him who loved us!‚Äù

Oh, that we would know You more, ever precious One!  
My only treasure is Your love!  
In all the earth and heaven above,  
I have no other prize!  
And though with passion I pray,  
And seek You day by day,  
I ask for nothing more.

[Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her ‚Äî Eph 5:25 \(BSB\)](https://i.redd.it/56ylec8obupe1.gif)

What an incredible example Christ gives to His followers! Few teachers could say, ‚ÄúIf you want to practice my teaching, just imitate my life.‚Äù But because Jesus‚Äô life is the perfect expression of virtue, He can point to Himself as both the model of holiness and its teacher. As Christians, we should aim for nothing less than Christ as our model. We should never be satisfied unless we reflect His grace.

As a husband, a Christian is to look at the example of Jesus and follow that pattern. A true Christian husband should love his wife as Christ loves the church.

The love of a husband is a special kind of love. Jesus has a special affection for the church, one that sets her apart from the rest of the world: ‚ÄúI pray for them‚ÄîI am not praying for the world.‚Äù The church is heaven‚Äôs treasure, the crown on Christ‚Äôs head, the bracelet on His arm, the breastplate on His heart, the very center of His love!

A husband should love his wife with a constant love, just as Jesus loves His church. His love doesn‚Äôt change. While He may change how He expresses it, the love itself remains the same.

A husband should love his wife with an enduring love, for nothing ‚Äúcan separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù

A true husband‚Äôs love is genuine and passionate‚Äîit‚Äôs not just words. Oh, beloved, what more could Christ have done to prove His love than what He has done? Jesus delights in His bride‚ÄîHe cherishes her affection and finds joy in her love. Christian, you marvel at Jesus‚Äô love; you admire it‚Äîare you imitating it? In your relationships, is the standard of your love ‚Äújust as Christ loved the church‚Äù?",1,1742474676.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

I have been buying small batches of coffee to roast for friends and family but I am thinking of making it more accessible to the public. I think that just selling what I give away would work but I want to know if there are other approaches for this :) 

Is there a process in which you follow to pick which coffee you want to sell? Ideally, I would think that you go to cupping events and you find the coffee that stands out to you and then you buy a larger batch of that. What if I do not have access to those kind of things?

Earth‚Äôs leaders were very impressed by our last mission‚Äôs performance. Our forces defeated the Arxur menace, and seeing their immediate defeat, the last remnants surrendered. The UN captured them, and I sincerely hope they are now rotting in prison. The crew celebrated, but then Jake got word we were given another new mission just a few hours after the last one. This mission itself was way more bold and reckless than the last one.

The situation in Sillis has gotten worse. Shaza‚Äôs forces have managed to raid the planet, and although the UN, even after being outnumbered 1 to 4, somehow contained her and her fleet around the planet‚Äôs atmosphere, laying FTL disruptors to prevent their escape. With that, the humans saw an opportunity, and when a predator sees an opportunity, they pounce at it with full force.

She took her entire fleet to Sillis for her grand raid, and now the humans noticed that her bases, like the cattle farms, are completely undefended. We were tasked to secure one of the cattle farms, but there is a catch: we were gonna have to do this alone. Just us three against the whole base. In the briefing, Jake said that the UN was severely stretched out raiding all of the other farms, and the leadership was confident we could do this alone. We weren‚Äôt gonna raid the station directly, thankfully, a boarding party was accompanying us to do just that, but taking out the base defenses was our sole job.

*I still haven‚Äôt fully recovered after the last engagement, only sleeping \[7 of the 9 hours\] we Gojids need. Farzam saw how tired I was before the briefing, and gave me something called ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù, a brown liquid with an earthly, toasty smell. If Michel had given this to me, I would have assumed it was a prank to make me to drink mud. Whatever this stuff is made of, it woke me right up.*

We were already in the air, approaching one of the Arxur‚Äôs beacons of evil. The boarding vessels, along with normal transport and hospital ships, were right behind us, waiting for our signal to raid the raiders. It wouldn't be long until those poor prey were liberated and rescued, just like the Venlil back at Venlil Prime. I should also call mom and dad after this, and talk about what I have done so far, I hadn‚Äôt had the time because of all of my studies. I wonder what dad will think.

‚ÄúThird biggest cattle farm of Shaza the big bitch. I gotta say, for a station, it‚Äôs pretty big.‚Äù Sellout, unfortunately, talks.

Of all the things Michel said, this one I could agree on. The station, floating light years away from any system, was shaped like a big, rectangular cylinder with interconnected layers in a distinct jet-black color. If it wasn‚Äôt marked on our radars, I would have almost missed it by the lack of light in our surroundings. The lower half of the station was teeming with docking ports, with no windows, while the upper half had partial shades of light coming out of a few windows, the only ones in the entire structure. I didn‚Äôt want to imagine what those people were living like, with some being born in these horrid places, not seeing natural sunlight for their entire life.

‚ÄúAnd we're going to free them all, and kill the bastards in the process. I don‚Äôt care what aliens think about us, we're ending this madness. Just give us the signal, Apex Squadron.‚Äù The commanding general of the forces that were gonna raid the base, Ratih, comes to our comms.

‚ÄúFinally, I'm doing what I signed up for. Can‚Äôt wait for these fascists to beg for their lives!‚Äù Farzam tells his opinion

‚ÄúWith you. I confess I have done some bad stuff in the past, but never as low as trafficking people in fucking cattle pens and cannibalizing them.‚Äù Michel says

‚ÄúMariana?‚Äù She looks back at me ‚ÄúWhat do you think of this?‚Äù

She looks back at the station ‚Äú...no mercy for the unmerciful.‚Äù

*Wow. I thought my hatred for the Arxur was big, but that line gave me chills.*

‚ÄúHeads up Apex, UN just gave me permission to patch us to the Arxur comms. We‚Äôre parsing through their traffic, stand by.‚Äù Jake informs

‚Äú-t is the doctor like?‚Äù An Arxur voice, nerve wracking, gets translated into Gojid Language.

‚ÄúLike Shaza herself. Fat and Cruel.‚Äù Another voice comes in, this one, more annoyed than the last one.

‚ÄúDo you think-‚Äù

The Arxur growls. ‚ÄúWill you shut your mouth? It‚Äôs hard working triple shifts with a rumbling stomach.‚Äù

The other Arxur, not pleased with the reply, growls as well. ‚ÄúI am trying to distract myself as well, fool. I am literally guarding the checkpoint to the mess hall, and the smell is driving me crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Our comms are fucked, and trying to fix this while everyone is away eating the cattle surplus, and your chatter, is really testing my patience. You're lucky I need you right now to test the frequency's encryption, so shut it and only speak when I tell you to.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre they having a party?‚Äù Farzam checks-in.

‚ÄúSeems like it.‚Äù Jake states. ‚ÄúMakes it easier for us and the assault team, since they aren‚Äôt on patrol.‚Äù

‚ÄúVollek, do you see those windows up there?‚Äù Mariana points a finger to my northeast. It was hard to see, since i didn‚Äôt have depth perception like humans, but fortunately, using the viewport zoom inherited from the federation tech, I spotted a barely lit window, with a lot of shadows, Arxur shadows, moving about. ‚ÄúTheir party is over there. Crash it.‚Äù

Replacing my disgust with sheer determination, I put up targets on several patches of windows that made their feeding area. After locking to their infrared signatures, the missiles were ready to fire.

‚ÄúFox 2! Missiles away!‚Äù I exclaimed

While not much time has passed, I finally got to ask Farzam some of my questions. Jake told me that a missile using infrared targeting is called a fox 2, one that uses an external radar receiver is a fox 1, and one that has its own radar is a fox 3. Thanks to terran engineering, we can choose one of the three types before firing, best suited for each situation. I asked Farzam what a ‚ÄúFox‚Äù is, along with my other questions, and he showed me a photo of one.

A Fox is a terrifying earth predator with orange fur. I don‚Äôt care if humans call it ‚Äúcute‚Äù and ‚Äúadorable‚Äù, those fangs could bite my throat and kill me in seconds! I imagine this is what their ‚Äúdogs‚Äù look like, by Gojid refuges witness descriptions. Farzam said that ‚ÄúCats‚Äù are a human ‚Äúpet‚Äù, whatever that is, but I didn't even bother asking for a picture because of how perturbed ‚Äúfoxes‚Äù made me feel. I changed the subject and decided to talk about Earth foods.

Cakes have nothing to do with predation or walking over them, thankfully. They are terran sweets, round in shape and have a soft, spongy texture. They come in many flavors and colors, can have frostings and fruit, both inside and out, and are generally covered with cream. I think this is the first time i wanted to try a terran dish, instead of the federation options i‚Äôm being served. Ravioli is also a terran dish, square shaped with its edges pressed together to seal a filling inside, and Farzam said it got that callsign for loving to eat ‚Äúpasta‚Äù, which is the type of dish Ravioli is part of.

The missiles arrive at their targets, and the explosions create a big hull breach, resulting in a violent explosive decompression. Arxur bodies began to fly out of the breach, along with other objects, dying in the vacuum of space. They got what they deserved, suffocating painfully from the lack of oxygen and atmosphere.

*They won‚Äôt eat people ever again.*

‚ÄúExplosion in the mess hall!! Everyone is dead! The fuck is going on??‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!?! Impossible! The federation is attacking us?‚Äù

‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE THE ONE IN THE CONTROL ROOM, SEE IT YOURSELF!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been made.‚Äù Farzam states.

‚ÄúSpace assault operation is a-go. All boarding transport elements remain ready to enter the farm.‚Äù Jake says.

‚ÄúThis is Supernova. Sellout, protect the transports. Me and Ravioli are going to take out the defenses.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCome on! I‚Äôm not letting you and Ravioli have all the fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are going to have a lot of fun intercepting anything that passes by us. Now move.‚Äù

‚ÄúActivating the defense network! This will scare them off!‚Äù The Arxur grunt declares.

Sellout turns his craft 180 degrees, going back to protect our vulnerable transports. Although their ships had kinetics and shields to protect themselves, it was better to play it safe, especially in such an important mission like this. And to think this was ‚Äúfun‚Äù to him, like some sort of game, is almost making me call him a predator instead of a human.

‚ÄúRavioli, Focus on this side of the station with me. Don‚Äôt worry about anything passing by and leave it to Sellout.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopied, nova.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Let‚Äôs be fast here.‚Äù

Hidden weapons emerge out of shutters all around the upper part of the base. Thankfully, there were no ships to protect them, so it was a more ‚Äúfair‚Äù fight. We start engaging them, with Mariana already destroying one of their missile launchers with her explosive ‚ÄúYaoguai‚Äù gun, and I start focusing on missile targeting their weapons and on shield rotation when we get close to them. Ravioli, in synchrony, does the same, destroying the targets that were out of reach to us.

‚ÄúHow many are there?! I am trying to mount a response, but nobody is listening to me, and the security chief got sucked off!‚Äù The Arxur grunt speaks desperately.

‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶two, maybe three, fighters? This doesn‚Äôt make any fucking sense!‚Äù

‚ÄúThose Herd Masters? It can‚Äôt be anyone else!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they are a much bigger flight. That can only mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no way the humans could have found out our location, Peksi. They achieved FTL in what, 2 months ago?! Even the federation prey is still oblivious to us!‚Äù

‚ÄúHerd Masters? What are they, another squadron just like us?‚Äù Ravioli asks.

‚ÄúYep, they are. I did some research on the federation, their internet is a cybersecurity nightmare. They are composed of 20 fighters, and if the propaganda is to be believed, they haven‚Äôt lost to anyone yet.‚Äù Jake responds.

‚ÄúThey sound like show offs. If they are so great, why doesn‚Äôt the federation deploy them at every Arxur raid?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, why doesn‚Äôt Apex get deployed into every battle the UN goes to?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you defending them, Lacuna?‚Äù

‚ÄúGiving them the benefit of the doubt. More nails coming your way, evade!‚Äù

The Herd Masters are no joke. Back on Venlil Prime, I had a coworker who was obsessed with them to no end, their entire workstation was covered with their merchandise. They were armed with the best the federation could offer, way beyond the caliber I used to work with or even working with now, and if the rumors are to be believed, they use Cold Fusion power generators, which is mind boggling that they could fit such a generator into a fightercraft.

*Protector, please, don‚Äôt let us encounter them. I am sinful for working with the humans, but please show us mercy.*

We were wrecking their defenses, most of their weapons were non-operational, with just a few left to squander. Farzam was also doing as good as us, even if he took a bit more damage than us.

‚ÄúThis is General Ratih. Captain Lacuna, are we clear to proceed?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlmost. Hold tight, general.‚Äù

‚ÄúStatus?!‚Äù The Arxur grunt exclames.

‚ÄúAlmost everything is down! This tracking AI is shit, I can‚Äôt get a solid hit on them!‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear, If i die today because of your incompetence, I will drag you to hell myself!‚Äù

Finally, we destroyed the last remains of their defenses, all signatures disappeared from the radar. Then, Jake addresses ‚ÄúResistance is a no factor. Go get them. Apex, roll the red carpet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat blasphemy is this? More ships appeared on the radar!‚Äù

Both we and Apex 3 maneuver to leave a clear path for the assault teams to enter. The boarding vessels, around \[500 meters\] in size, get ready to enter the station to save the innocents trapped inside.

‚ÄúBravo Pilot 2, deploy the hose.‚Äù The general orders.

One boarding ship sprays a strange foam using a nozzle attached to its upper part unto the breach, covering large parts of it. It‚Äôs look‚Äôs like‚Ä¶Aluminum? When they are done, they and 2 other boarding vessels stay with us, while the others go to the nearby docking ports, spreading out to catch our enemy off guard.

*Interesting. They used the foam to seal the breach, only leaving small holes so they could get inside without exposing themselves to the vacuum. The terrans truly think of every detail.*

‚ÄúFinally, I hate babysitting.‚Äù Michel comes back.

‚ÄúWhat, can‚Äôt handle responsibility, Sellout?‚Äù Farzam chimes in.

‚ÄúThe transports didn‚Äôt need any defense, they were just targeting you two! I bet this was just an excuse by nova to get me off Rational‚Äôs spiky back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know how important they are. We can‚Äôt leave anyone trapped in here because we lost one of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck off. Lacuna, come here. I want a favor.‚Äù

Jake sighs. ‚ÄúWhat is it, Sellout?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you let me speak in their comms? I‚Äôve been waiting to use this one for a long while.‚Äù

‚ÄúUse what?‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see, Ration.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna regret this, ain‚Äôt I? Passing you along.‚Äù Jake said, frustrated.

‚ÄúI can see them entering! Be ready when they open the door!‚Äù One of the Arxur grunts from before speaks once more.

‚ÄúThis is General Ratih to Alpha to Bravo team‚Äôs, enter the breach and turn your Magboots on. Bravo Grenadier, I can see through your helmet camera that the Arxur have setup an defense behind the blast doors. You still have no atmosphere, so bomb them and engage the enemy, then wait for further orders. Charlie and Delta teams, proceed with the original plan and assault designated points ‚ÄòStomach‚Äô and ‚ÄòBrain‚Äô, you should face less resistance than we have anticipated.‚Äú

‚ÄúStand back, explosives away!‚Äù A soldier exclaimed.

‚ÄúWait, what are they doing?!‚Äù

‚ÄúHello bozo.‚Äù Sellout makes the most unfunny joke of all time.

Before the Arxur has a chance to reply, an explosion rocks their communications. I could hear from our soldiers microphones the sound of air rushing in to fill in the vacuum that was left by our breach. The Arxur were not putting up much of a fight, judging by the sounds of gunfire. It wasn‚Äôt long before one of them reported back.¬†

‚ÄúAlpha 1-1, all current targets eliminated. No casualties or wounded. Orders?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlpha team, regroup with Charlie and assist them in capturing ‚ÄòStomach‚Äô. Delta has already secured and pacified ‚ÄòBrain‚Äô. Bravo, secure the current location and deploy inflatables on the Aluminum walls to space, we are going to route Zurulian Medical staff and V.I.Ps transports to your location.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure this is a good idea.‚Äù I voice my opinion. ‚ÄúArxur were just eating here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis room can act as another docking port, since you guys blew everything in it up, including the smell and kitchen appliances. It'll make getting them all out here faster.‚Äù The general replied.

‚ÄúApex, patrol the area until we are ready to leave. If you see any Arxur vessels, both leaving and arriving at the station, shoot them on sight.‚Äù Jake said.

The rest of the transports arrive near the breach, making a waiting line to load and unload personnel and cargo, as we go away to patrol the otherside of the base. Technically, our mission here is complete. We finally did it, after so long, we got back to the predators and rescued the Arxur Cattle. Sure, it wasn‚Äôt all of them, and this is just one base out of who knows many, but if a group of 3 fighters could kill their defenses, I bet the rest of the UN is having no problem dealing with the rest.

For the first time in a while, I feel‚Ä¶purposeful. So purposeful. I helped save so many people from grim lifes, devoid of hope and full of suffering, and brought Justice against the Arxur. Sure, this only happened because of the humans who found the farms we were looking for so long in just a matter of months, but if I was back at my old job, Apex would have never launched in time, and who would have helped here if it wasn‚Äôt us? Would the terrans even have the resources to attack this farm without leaving another one behind?

Whatever the answer would be, I wouldn't overturn the fact that we played a big role in the capture of this Arxur base today. I smile, and for the first time since the humans' arrival, I start looking forwards towards the future.

[That I may walk before the Lord in the land of the living.‚Äî Ps 116:9](https://preview.redd.it/xb7xuxgc9upe1.jpg?width=953&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e08764e9c35c5abe6c42dad50d2fa1b28788a4f)

There is a difference between walking before God and walking with God. To walk before God is to live with a constant awareness of His watchful eye upon us, desiring to do what pleases Him, walking blamelessly in His ordinances, and living in a manner that is unspotted by the world. It means to live before Him, whether in private or public, alone or in company, in the church or the world, day or night, as though His glorious majesty were constantly before our eyes.

If we were to carry this deep, daily awareness that God sees every thought, marks every movement, hears every word, and observes every action, it would place a restraint upon our lightness and folly. We would watch our thoughts, words, and actions as those who live under the constant gaze of God‚Äôs searching eye. This is what it means to walk before God.

But we read that Enoch ‚Äúwalked with God.‚Äù This is a higher stage of the divine life. To walk with God is to live in sweet fellowship with Him, in holy confidence, with a blessed sense of a saving interest in His love and grace. It is to walk with Him as a friend walks with a friend, sharing close, intimate communion. Some walk before God, but how few truly walk with God! Many live with a deep sense of God‚Äôs presence, yet they do not enter into this intimate fellowship or enjoy the blessedness of walking in heavenly communion with Him.",1,1742474134.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

I started going to this small coffee shop every morning before work. There was always an older guy sitting at the same table by the window, reading a newspaper. He never had a laptop, never seemed in a rush‚Äîjust sat there with his coffee, flipping through the pages like it was a ritual.

At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of him. We never spoke, just nodded at each other occasionally. But over time, I started to notice little things. He always got the same order. The baristas knew his name. Sometimes he‚Äôd chat with them about the weather or a book he was reading.

One day, he asked me about my coffee choice, and we had a short conversation. After that, we‚Äôd exchange small talk every few mornings. Nothing deep‚Äîjust the kind of casual familiarity that makes a place feel comfortable.

Then, about two weeks ago, he wasn‚Äôt there. I figured maybe he was sick or had an appointment. But he never came back. I kept going at the same time, expecting to see him at his table, but it‚Äôs been empty ever since.

I don‚Äôt know his story or where he went, but I hope he‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs strange how you can barely know someone, yet still feel their absence.

I tried to end it and she said no. AITAH if I tell her husband so it all blows up? 

Full post:   
I‚Äôm 39M. I had a 37F friend that is married 41M. I met her 6 months ago when I was in a relationship with someone else. She and her husband both work in the same place that I do.  The friend, and her husband, became close friends of mine. From the first time I met her, though, I had a romantic interest in her, though I never acted on it, and never told anyone, as I was dating someone, and she is married. 

Over time I grew to trust her as a good friend and opened up to her, feeling safe to talk to her and share personal things because I thought I had a really good, platonic friendship that I could count on. 

I broke up with my partner because of problems in our own relationship, and I informed the friend. She was there for me and very supportive - so was her husband. A few days after my breakup, however, I was chatting with her privately, and she said that of all of our mutual friends, male, I was the only one she had a crush on or sexual interest in. She, apparently, thought she could just make the comment and I would let it go, because she had no idea how I felt. I acted strange and dealt with a whirlwind of emotions about it‚Ä¶ later that night I told her I had felt the same from the first time I saw her. 

Over the coming weeks what developed between us was an intense emotional extramarital affair. We never had physical intimacy beyond a cuddle or hug, but the emotional connection was the most intense I ever felt. She seemed to awaken something in me, some sense of connection that I never knew was possible with a romantic partner. She said it was the same for her.  The whole time, however, we had to move in secret and deceive our friends, coworkers, my family, and her family. 

She told me that she loved me, was in love with me, and wanted to be with me, but couldn‚Äôt because she is married and doesn‚Äôt want to leave him, even though now she sees what a partner should and could be like for her, and her husband doesn‚Äôt measure up to the feeling she has from me. 

One day last week, after this 3-week long affair, she told me that her relationship with her husband has been suffering, that they haven‚Äôt been able to be physically intimate, that she‚Äôs been lying to him and arguing, that he‚Äôs confused and worried she‚Äôs going to leave him and doesn‚Äôt understand why. I told her I had to exit the situation and disappear from her life so she could repair her marriage and I could heal. She told me no, that she wouldn‚Äôt lose me. 

I tried to continue on for a few days, slowly phasing myself out, but she kept chasing, telling me she loved me, asking me to meet her and our friends in a group, telling me she needed me around. Finally I told her I wouldn‚Äôt speak to her anymore, and blocked her. I avoided our friends, my friend group. I was depressed, anxious, visibly distraught, and unable to focus on work. Friends noticed the rift between me and her and asked her and me both about it, and we gave answers to try to cover things. After a few days the depression and distress got the better of me and I messaged her. She wanted to talk. She missed me. We met for coffee. It was the happiest I had been in days. She was radiant, staring at me like she was in love still, finally at ease. 

The next day, - today - she said that she needed to implement boundaries because she can‚Äôt keep this going. She is hurting herself, her husband, and me. She wants me to be her friend only, and says that if I don‚Äôt agree to that, I will be showing her that she isn‚Äôt good enough as the only thing she is able to give me, and if I really love her I will settle for that. She won‚Äôt tell her husband anything, and she will try to fix that relationship, she won‚Äôt end the marriage that she knows she doesn‚Äôt want to be in. 

I can‚Äôt go to just being her friend. I feel that is the worst outcome. I was given a chance to have an intense emotional connection, and then it was taken away. I know I made mistakes here and I did plenty of wrong. AITAH for my parts in all of this? Absolutely. That's not a question. But, I can‚Äôt go back to just being friends and forgetting it, while seeing her daily, and seeing them together, daily. When I tried to just leave she fought me and refused to let me go. I can‚Äôt be with her, she won't let me be without her. AITAH if I take the nuclear option and tell her husband everything? (I kept screenshots of - literally everything she ever said about me, about him, about anything I would need in case this blew up in my face and I was accused of anything - again, I know ITAH for a lot, but before I become the even bigger one, I wanted advice from the faceless mobs reddit.",11,1742473638.0,AITAH,44,0.68,False

I love it. Every 5-7 days, it will display ""FLU"" indicating it would like to be flushed. Awesome. Per the manual, it states I should flush the machine until ""rdY/Go"" appears on the display. This is the fact text from the manual:

>While 'FLU' is shown on the display, the user should perform a flush until 'rdY/Go' is shown on the display. To do this, keep the portafilter clamped and place a tall cup under the portafilter spout.

>When the message 'rdY/Go' appears, the machine is ready to brew the first cup of coffee.

The *issue* I'm having: ""rDY/Go"" never comes up. I'll flush about 20 oz. of water and the counter just keeps going. Anyone else experience this or have any advice? The machine works just fine. Wondering it I'm doing something wrong.",1,1742473221.0,profitec,2,1.0,False

0% sour 0% bitter. Sure it isn‚Äôt a complex one but I like it. Pulled 2 shots and both were good! Without pre infusion (which was 7-8 sec) it took 32-33 sec for 39 gr of coffee. Probably grind 1 setting coarser and see how it goes but currently I‚Äôm happy with it.
