I've been dealing with this annoying sub for about two months now, and my patience has been stretched repeatedly to the point where it's unbelievable.

I've put so much effort into making sure my stories would be appeasing and praised, but that's not what happens whenever I show my work. I have talent, and this sub knows that, and yet my stories keep getting less praise than they deserve. Sometimes it's even labeled as mediocre! Mediocre I tell you!

Not only that but everything I write gets overshadowed by Lewis. Fucking Lewis! The shit he makes isn't even that good! It's always the same topic over and over in a different scenario to the point where it's ridiculous.

I've had enough of this shit, I've had enough of my stories having less appreciation, I'm tired of seeing Lewis do better than me, and I'm tired of this sub undermining my ability to write or even showcase my talent.

So that's why I decided to take measures into my own hands, I know that what I did was wrong, but I had to teach that bitch a lesson. Putting the rat poison into Ms. Adkins' cup of coffee was easier than I thought it was, and in a few minutes, she'll be on the floor throwing up and coughing a storm.

Once she's gone, Mr. Koch will come back, and then things will become better, he was the only person who truly acknowledged my talent after all, and he was the only person who motivated me to keep writing.

With him returning, Creative Writing class will become much better.",3,1733446156.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Memory Transcription Subject: Elanor Florence, Human, Human exchange program participant.

======

I finally felt my heart begin to cam down as I said a goodbye to Helin and ducked out of the stuffy, claustrophobic little terminal building and back into the cool, breezy alpine air. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, it felt like it had been ages since my last proper breath and that brisk air was just what I needed. Well, that and the feeling of Tolva’s soft little paw pads.

*Oh my god I get to touch the beans!*

*Shush you, he is not a pet nor a small animal for you to stroke at your leisure, keep your hands to yourself!*

*But he’s so cute!*

*He’s a person and your friend and he deserves dignity!*

*Of course, of course\~*

“Wow, you really weren’t kidding about being shy, were you?”

I’m pulled out of my thoughts and back to reality by Tolva’s lovely high-pitched voice. I looked down at him and felt my face grow warm again as I registered his question, “uh, y-yeah.” I admitted sheepishly.

His tail wagged in a way I’m pretty sure meant joy… or maybe amusement? It was positive at least I’m pretty sure, “Well, I’m sure you’ll settle right in!” he reassured me cheerily

I smiled under the mask and nodded, I couldn't imagine trying to deal with all this without having him here with me. I didn’t quite *know him* know him, but I felt a lot more comfortable around him than I would a total stranger, “So,” I began with a deep breath, “If I remember right, you said that you live on the other side of the colony from the space port, right? On the western edge by a large park, just inside the protection wall?”

Tolva looked quite surprised and, If I was reading him and his wagging tail right, quite pleased as well at my recollection, “That’s right! You have a good memory,”

I felt a little tickle inside at being praised by such an adorable little creature, his pretty amber eyes were so reassuring, “I have good head for directions like that,” I replied with a small hint of pride.

“From all the hiking, right?”

I nodded, “Yep, lots of hiking and camping,”

He giggled, “That’s alongside the track and field, archery, skiing, trapshooting, and cross country running too, right?”

“I’m not the only one with a good memory it would seem,” I remarked, feeling happy that he remembered as well.

“of course! How could I forget, I’m the one who bombarded you with questions about that stuff,” he laughed – a wonderful, musical sound with an almost songbird quality with the slight whistling – and then looked up to me with big, hopeful eyes, “hey, do you think that maybe you could take *me* hiking? Like, out in the woods and stuff?”

“uh…” I faltered a moment, not sure what to say until I saw the slight tip in his ears and tail and the fear of disappointing him overwhelmed me entirely, “I mean I’m not against it but why me? Isn’t Helin’s husband an out-doorsy Venlil?”

“oh, uh…” his ears sank a bit and his ears flushed a dull orange, “well… I-I’ve been walking a lot, around the park and around town, to build up my stamina… but… walking on uneven terrain is still hard for me and I know that I would need to stop a lot… so…”

*oh my god wait, is he suggesting\~ There’s no way, right?*

Tolva took a deep breath and blushed a more vibrant shade of orange as he pausd to work up the courage to continue, “Maybe… you could carry me?”

*Oh my god he was suggesting it! Ohmygodohmygodohmygod! YES! YES, PLEASE LET ME PICK YOU UP AND CARRY YOU AROUND OHMYGOD!*

I needed a moment to choke by my excitement and managed to stifle my reflexive girlish squeal into a small squeak which I covered with a cough before nodding, “uh, y-yeah. Yeah I’d be fine with that. Just uh… Yeah… I’ll need to uh, read up a bit on camping laws and stuff, but yeah, I’d definitely be up for that. OH!” I pulled out my pad and opened up the app for *SlingShot*, ‘the premier inter-planetary consumer delivery service!’ and quickly opened my ‘Venlil safe foods’ favorites list, “I’ll order some chocolate, vegan marshmallows and graham crackers, and we can have s’mores!”

out of the corner of my eye I saw his tail wag excitedly at the prospect, “Really? I-It’s not too expensive? Isn’t… Isn’t inter-planetary delivery expensive?”

“Nah, it’s fine,” I replied dismissively as I tucked the phone into my pocket, “Anyway, where we going and how we going there?”

“Oh! R-right. Umm… well, they set up the Hab just like a block or two down from where I live. I thought maybe we could walk there?” he sounded a little uncertain, “But… uh, I didn’t think you’d have so much luggage,”

I smiled and laughed, “Nah, a walk is fine by me. Well… if you don’t mind parading me though town,”

“I-I certainly don’t mind but… are… are you sure? You seemed like you… uh… were about at your limit just talking with Helin,”

“well that’s because I really wanted to make a good impression with her!” I explained with a heavy sigh and slight hunch of my shoulders before perking up with a smile behind my mask, “but if it’s just random passers buy staring at me, I don’t really care. It’s not like I’ll have to stop and introduce myself to all of them, right?”

“Ah, r-right… I guess that makes sense,” Tolva seemed to consider that for a moment before nodding and perking up again, “yeah, lets go for a walk!”

Advance time 30 minutes

“Tolva, please sit down,” I urged gently as I stopped walking and pointed to an empty bunch just inside the grassy perimeter of what was the fourth small park we had encountered so far.

“Elanor, I’m fine. Really, I promise!” the little black Venlil insisted defiantly yet again as he also stopped and turned partially towards me to put me in the middle of his right eye’s field of view. This was the fifth time I had suggested he take a break and the fifth time he had given me a distinct and firm ‘no’. I wasn’t going to give up so easily this time though.

“Tolva, your legs are shaking,”

He looked down and frowned before smacking his upper thigh with a paw and standing triumphantly as the leg in question stopped shaking, “I’m *fine* see?”

I sighed heavily and shook my head, “you’re wincing every other step! You’re not fooling me with the ‘I’m fine routine’,” I countered pointedly

“Oh right, trained to spot weakness in prey, right?” He teased, making the mistake of leaning forward slightly for emphasis, something his very tired legs weren’t up for and he flailed a moment before falling face first onto the concrete. Or he would have if I hadn’t caught him under the arms.

“Precisely. Now, trust my predatory senses and *sit down*, mister” I didn’t give him a chance to refuse, simply picking him up and setting him down directly on the park bench before I myself sat down on the grass next to it. Even sitting on the ground like that I was slightly taller than him, something which I found a little amusing.

His ears turned a touch orange and he looked down at his little paws with seeming embarrassment for a few quiet minutes, “I’m sorry,” he muttered eventually.

I looked over to him curiously, “for what?”

“for… for… I don’t know,” he sighed heavily and his ears drooped, “I guess I’m sorry that you have to stop because of me,”

“then you’re sorry for the wrong thing,” I replied pointedly with a small shake of my head.

He looked up suddenly, looking quite confused and worried, “W-what do you mean?”

“You *should* be sorry for pushing yourself so dang much you almost fell and busted your cute little snout!” I explained with a small laugh, “Come on, we’re supposed to be friends, right?”

Tolva gave a small, still confused looking nod, “Right,”

“And as your friend, do you think I wanna see you uncomfortable or in pain?”

“N-no,” he admitted sheepishly

*He’s always a little sheepish, hehe.*

*Shush.*

“I have no problems stopping and sitting here in the grass, no problems at all. We’re not in any rush and even if we were I wouldn’t want you to push yourself to the point that you’re hurting. So what are you sorry for? For giving me an opportunity to sit on some soft grass on a lovely day and chat with the friend I traveled between stars to meet?” I laughed and gently leaned over to until my shoulder nudged his a little, “Oh no, what a terrible burden to inflict upon me\~”

He blushed even more and his tail wagged happily at my words, the adorable display warming my heart and bringing a big smile to my face behind my mask. I let the warm moment draw out for a few seconds before gently patting my knees and looking back over to him, “So! There is actually something I wanted to ask you,”

Tolva seemed a touch surprised by this, “Oh? O-ok, uh, ask away!”

“I’ve been wondering why you have your wool so short. You mentioned that you have a hard time staying warm so I thought that you’d keep your wool longer,”

“Oh, well it’s not just that I have a hard time keeping warm, I have hard time cooling off too. So I keep a body warmer on and keep my wool short so that I can cool off quickly when I turn it off,”

I frowned and cocked my head, it didn’t look like he was wearing anything, “Body warmer?”

“Yeah,” He looked the claw of his thumb into his wool and pulled up a thin, somewhat elastic looking band that seemed to have a cable running through it, “It’s a bunch of heating bands basically. I keep my wool just long enough that I can cover it up,”

“Oh! That’s clever,”

He blushed again and fidgeted, “Thanks… But… that’s not the only reason it’s short… it’s also a lot of work to take care of longer wool and if I have it longer I find I often need to choose between properly brushing and grooming it and having energy to actually do stuff in the day,”

I gave a small, sympathetic nod, “I can understand that. Well I for one think you look nice with short wool. I bet it also makes great contrast with your sister in photos,”

He giggled at that and flicked his ears, “thank you,”

Tolva finished giggling and could see his rectangular pupil travel down and then back up me as what I’m pretty sure was a pensive expression grew on his face, “umm… Can I ask about your… jacket?”

*Damnit.*

I took a deep breath and let it out as a heavy sigh before nodding, “Sure, go right ahead,”

He hesitated another moment before finally asking, “Uh it looks like… erm, that is… i-is it… real hide?”

I nodded slowly as I ran my finger along the stripped black and white wool interior of the jacket, “Yeah… uh… Remember when I said that my family has a farm? Well… we kept sheep pretty much throughout my entire childhood,”

Tolva’s eyes widened, “y-you mean those things that… that look like non-sapient Venlil?”

“Yeah,” I affirmed with a nod, “Anyway there was one who was born with a rather unique coat, these sort of zebra-like stripes,” I unzipped my jacket slightly to show the pattern on the inner layer, “He uh… he was my favorite. I named him Zebby. He was kinda sickly when he was a lamb, so I spent a lot of time taking care of him and I think he came to like me too. He would always kick up a fuss if anyone else tried to shear him and he would follow me around the pasture if he could,”

I paused and smiled warmly at the memory before letting fade giving a sad sigh, “Well, sheep only live about 10 to12 years or so, he made it to 13 so he had full and happy life and I stayed with him all through the night when he passed... Grampy, erm, my Grandfather, had this made so that Zebby could still keep me warm even though he wasn’t around to give wool for sweaters anymore.”

Tolva’s ears and tail drooped slightly, “oh… I… I’m sorry,”

“Nah, it’s alright,” I reassure him, “it’s kind of just a fact of life when it comes to keep pets or livestock. I’m glad Zebby got to live his Sheep-y live to the fullest… and I got a really nice jacket.”

I could tell that he didn’t quite know how respond to that so I redirected his attention with another question, “So uh, how have things around here changed after the federation?”

“Well… uh… To be honest, not a ton has changed. The Guild… well The Guild was formally dissolved, but most of them are now working for the Wildlife Management Office so it didn’t really change things up too much. The whole idea of predator disease and how it’s treated has pretty much been turned inside out. I…” His ears drooped and his tail gave a sad looking flick, “I had no idea how *bad* things were inside those treatment centers. I feel so ashamed when I think about how glad I was when my neighbor got brought into one of them. I know I was just a pup at the time but I thought that they would help him and when he didn’t come back my parents just told me he moved somewhere new and I never thought twice about it,”

He chuckled a little, his ears raising back up slightly, “I guess we both accidentally picked somewhat sad topics, huh?”

“Looks that way,” I said with a chuckle of my own and a small nod

His ears twitched this way and that as he seemed to think for a few quiet seconds before something seemed to occur to him, “Well… uh… I know, how did you get so big?”

“I ate all my vegetables, even the yucky ones,” I teased earning a confused look from the Venlil, “Ah right, well… Surely there must be *something* that’s good for you guys but you don’t generally like as kids, right?”

Tolva bunched up his nose, “Torma Root, yuck! I still don’t know how people eat that stuff, it’s so bitter and weird,”

“Yeah, there we go. I ate all my Torma Root,” I giggled before answering honestly, “Well, you see my mom… my mom was a bit like you, I guess. She got tired easily, but also just had generally poor health and was very frequently sick pretty much her whole life. Bad roll of the dice on recessive genetic disorders. So when she go pregnant with my older sister, she decided she would undergo gene therapy so that my big sis would be healthy,”

As I spoke I could see worry grow on his face, he was pretty clearly thinking he had accidentally chosen another heavy topic, “did it work?”

“Yep! But… it didn’t seem that way at first. Allergies, sinus and ear infections, bronchitis, asthma, and a bunch of other stuff. It all cleared up by the time my sister was eight but she was only four when my mom got pregnant with me so at that point it just looked like it had failed altogether,” I let out a low whistle and sighed, “Sooo, for me my mom went a bit… *overboard*. To say the least. To this day Grampy still won’t tell me exactly what kind of favors he pulled or with whom, but I got the works. It more resembled a super-soldier program rather than a corrective gene therapy regimen.”

“I… I guess I can understand that,” Tolva remarked thoughtfully, “I know my sister was agonizing over whether or not to have Phila’s gene mods reversed so she’d be closer to a she’d grow up to be more like unmodded Venlil,”

I nodded, “I can imagine that’s something weighing very heavily on a lot of expecting Venlil now. What did they decide in the end?”

“They had her knees ‘fixed’ but didn’t go any further than that. They want her to be healthy and happy, but they didn’t want to risk making her feel too… ‘other’ I guess,”

“That’s certainly something I can understand,” I laughed, “I mean, I’m 7’10 and almost 600lbs for crying out loud! Sometimes I feel like I’m barely human at all,”

He gave me a sad look but I gently poked the end of his snout and smiled behind my mask, “Don’t look so down, I’m very happy the way I am! I wear my childhood nickname, ‘Amazonian’, with pride.”

He blushed again and rubbed at the spot I poked him, I giggled and fished my thermos out of my bag while he was temporarily distracted. I unscrewed the top and took a big long swig of the orange flavored drink inside.

“GAH! Wh-what is that!?”

I jumped slightly at Tolva’s sudden exclamation and looked over to find him leaned away with a look of horror on his face. I looked at him, rather confused before it suddenly struck me.

“OH, no, no, no, it’s a fruit-flavored drink!” I insisted as I wiped the bit that had dribbled down my cheek away with the back of my hand, “Gosh I didn’t even consider the color, my bad,”

Tolva let out a long sigh of relief and readjusted his posture with a hand over his chest, “Speh. I thought you were drinking Venlil blood or something!”

I snicker at the absurd notion and shake my head, “I am most assuredly *NOT* doing anything like that nor do I want to,”

“That’s a relief,” Tolva chuckled, still trying to steady himself after his little scare, “That… I don’t know what I would do if you were,”

“Well I would hardly fault you for thinking poorly of me,” I laughed, “Setting aside the more obvious issues with something like that, it would be in *insanely* poor taste,”

The little black Venlil chuckled a little more and nodded before sliding off the park bench and standing. He looked much more steady on his paws than he had a minute ago and I smiled behind my mask and also rose to my feet, “Feeling better now?” I asked with a slightly teasing tone as I grabbed my bag again

“Yeah…” He took on a hue rather like the Tang I had just drank as he murmured bashfully, “Th-thanks. For making me stop and take a break.”

I smiled and patted him on the head, getting a startled \*beep!\* from him and a deeper hue of orange which made me giggle a bit as I withdrew my hand, “Sorry, sorry. It’s just you’re so *soft*,”

“I-I don’t mind, I was just surprised is all,” He mumbled.

I’m sure that the movements of his tail and ears were meant to convey… something, but despite all the videos and articles I had watched and read on the subject in preparation for this trip, I couldn’t parse a bit of meaning from any of it.

I took a moment to look around and only then realized how many eyes were on us. I had seen a number of Venlil going this way and that out of the corner of my eye, but I hadn’t paid much attention at all and actually thought it was kind of nice how little attention they seemed to be paying us. This had of course only been me forgetting that Venlil don’t look at things straight on like humans do. In reality, not a single one of them let me out of their sight, turning their heads slightly as they passed by to ensure I remained within their wide field of vision.

Just me looking around was enough to make many of them visibly jump and hurry their pace, a few pulled out their personal pads and hastily tapped what I could only assume to be the number of some kind of local authority.

I felt my throat go a little tight and I looked back down at Tolva bashfully, “S-sorry, Maybe\~ Maybe we should go,”

He nodded in agreement and we set off again.

\-----

Advance time 50 minutes.

\-----

Poor little Tolva looked about ready to flop over by the time we reached the front door of my new accommodations, and new was certainly the right word to describe it. It was a brand new UN provided Sapient Coalition prefab modular hab. UN-SCPMH, ugh, an atrocious acronym.

In either case, the boxy, bright yellow building was still obnoxiously bright even in the dimming light of the early night. It had a look that was somewhere between plastic and metal with a smooth and shiny exterior. As the name implied, the hab was designed to be able to be assembled a variety of ways and the more hab kits you had, the more complex assemblies you could make. This was a quite generous 5 kit assembly that was -theoretically- proportioned to house up to 3 Arxur comfortably. Well, for a given value of ‘comfortable’ anyway.

I pulled my pad out of my pocket and was pleasantly surprised to find that the front lock was already synced to my personal communication address. One press of an on-screen button and the door unlocked with a satisfyingly heavy \*clunk\* allowing me to pull the latch and open the door outward.

I nodded with satisfaction as I saw that the interior was well big enough for me and looked down to Tolva, “Ok, let’s\~”

*oh my.*

My voice trailed off as I noticed him swaying slightly. His eyes were heavily lidded and he was panting lightly while his face and ears were flushed a deep orange. Naturally his little legs were also shaking like saplings in a thunderstorm.

Damn it. I should have pushed him to stop and rest again along the way, but shortly after our little pause in the park a pair of totally-not-exterminators had started following behind us at a distance of about 15 yards for so and Tolva seemed even less inclined to interact with them than I was which was definitely saying something.

I scowled under my mask and turned to look back towards the street where the pair were still standing. The black, heat ablative visors of their suits made it even harder for me to pick up the body language Venlil relied on so damn much, but the way they stood and the way they idly tapped just above the trigger housing of their flamethrowers reminded me of the way Grampy had waited by the front porch for my sister’s prom date to bring her home.

I grumbled to myself and tossed my bag into the doorway before scooping up Tolva in my now free arm and stepped inside, careful to make sure I didn’t accidentally bump his against the door frame or, god forbid, close the door on his tail.

I took a moment to look around the interior of the hab as I held Tolva’s rather limp form against my chest and shoulder. They layout reminded me of my sister’s apartment actually. Just inside the door was a small tile area perhaps 4x4ft with a sliding closet immediately to the left. Stepping up out of the tiled area brought you onto carpet and into a large space divided into a carpeted living room ahead and a tiled kitchen to the left by a half-wall/counter top table.

I brought Tolva into the living room area and gently set him down on the couch to the far right side of the space, he made a slight whimpering sound that gave me pause for a moment but settled into the couch without complaint. I unslung my other bag from my shoulder and plopped it onto the floor by the couch before walking back to the entryway and taking off my boots and hanging my jacket in the closet.

As I came back into the living room I looked to the right of the couch and down the hallway that was there, I could see four closed doors but finding out what was behind them could wait for a little while.

It was actually pretty funny just how small Tolva looked on the couch. He took up less than half of one of the three cushions, looking almost like a child as he sat there. I smiled slightly and stepped into the kitchen. It took me a few moments of opening and closing cabinets to find a stack of plastic cups. I took one of them down and filled it with cold water from the tap before bringing it out to Tolva. “Here you go, gotta stay hydrated,” I said softly as I handed him the cup

He nodded appreciatively and took a big swig before settling back into the couch, “I’m sorry,” He said between panting breaths

I furrowed my brow in amusement and stifled a chuckle, “Oh? What for this time?”

“Those… guys,” He managed before stopping to take a few more deep breaths, “They uh… Well a lot of the guild members came together to make the Predator Watch Group,”

I gave a heavy sigh and shook my head, “Makes sense. A bunch of yahoos full of prejudice who came together to make a ‘citizen’s militia’ so they could keep harassing people like they always had,”

He looked a little surprised to hear me say that, “Are there… things like that on earth?”

“Oh yeah, big time,” I confirmed as I sat down next to him, “It’s gotten a lot better than it was a century or two ago but the country I’m from, America, has a pretty unfortunate past absolutely full of those kinds of groups,”

“I-I see,”

I frowned and looked over to him, he had been getting less orange but it seemed he was growing orange allover again now, “What’s wrong?” I asked worriedly, “are you ok?”

I saw his gaze shift up, the boxy pupil of his right eye focused square on me, “Y-you can take off the mask,” He murmured shyly

oh… I forgot I was even wearing it.

I did as he suggested and removed my silvery mask slowly, offering him the kindest, warmest smile I could manage without showing teeth. He tensed a little as my eyes were revealed, his ears stranding straight up and his tail flinching.

“You sure? If it’s too scary I can-”

“No, you’re just very pretty!” He blurted suddenly before his eyes went even wider and he looked away while he covered his face with his paws, “I-I-I MEAN YOU’RE NOT SCARY! Y-YOU LOOK NICE – I MEAN KIND! YOU LOOK KIND AND V-VERY N-NOT SCARY!”

I felt my face go hot and I had to turn to look away as I tried and failed to stifle my laughter.

*OHMYGODHE’SSOCUTE!*

“I’m s-sorry,” I managed through choked snickers, “I-I don’t mean to laugh, I- oh my goodness, I need a second,”

I laughed openly for a few seconds before turning back to him. He was looking away from me with his ears fully down and his face still covered by his paws.

*Awww, I shouldn’t have laughed. Please don’t be sad!*

I leaned forward and gently wrapped my arms around him, getting a startled \*Beep!\* as I pulled him partially up onto my lap, “Well you are a very handsome and adorable little gentleman who has made me feel very welcome despite how scared and nervous I was,”

He looked up from behind his paws with a questioning look, “Y-you were scared? Of… of the exterminators?”

I shook my head and gently nuzzled the top of his head, delighting in sensation of the soft fuzzy wool against my chin my lips, “I was scared that I would make a bad impression. That you wouldn’t like me or that I’d say or do something wrong and frighten you. I was so scared that we wouldn’t be able to just… chat how we did online,” I admitted in a soft voice as I turned my head so that my cheek was against the wool atop his head, “It’s happened before. With other friends I’ve made online. I… I’m so glad you weren’t afraid of me in-person.”

I felt the movement of his tail against my leg and belly as it wagged behind him and his ear came up in what I assume was a positive emote, bapping me right on the nose as it did so, “Hey, watch the ears,” I giggled

He laughed before growing quiet and turning a little orange again, “I… I had a lot of practice. I hope that this doesn’t sound weird, but I… I used one of the pictures you sent me as the background for my pad,” He admitted shyly, “I… I’ll be honest, I scared myself a few times having forgotten that I had done that,”

He… He went through that for me? I gently firmed up my embrace around him as I felt a fluttery, warm sensation inside me, “I… Thank you.” I had no idea how to express just how much I appreciated that.

I he relaxed into me a little and I took a moment to let my eyes wander around the living room. there was a standing lamp to my right, a coffee table a few feet in front of the couch that honestly was large enough that to Tolva it could certainly have been just an ordinary dining table. There was a very large TV set hung flush with the wall opposite the couch and the wall to my right was taken up primarily by a large window which looked out to small grassy yard which ran right up to a rather tall and very robust looking chain-link fence which I assumed was the protection wall meant to keep wild predators out.

*I wonder… does it have a concrete foundation? I’d hope so, else something could just dig its way in.*

My musings were interrupted by a trilling, rumbling sound that brought to mind a cat. A large one, like a main coon. It took me a half a second to process where I was hearing it from, but when I finally put it together it felt like my heart was going to melt.

Tolva had fallen asleep and the little black Venlil was purring (or maybe cooing?) softly as he leaned against me. I felt my brow furrow as a smile crossed my lips and I slowly, gently, laid back across the couch, bringing one leg up over the arm rest closest to the kitchen as I rested my head against the opposite one and settled in with the sleepy little Venlil curled up on top of me.

*Ok, I admit it. I'm glad I didn't chicken out.*

I want to see if I can be less of a stranger to a fellow F in this subreddit.

I'm 30F, from southeast asia (gmt/utc +7), a full time remote worker who develops a sense of isolation over time bcuz of the way my work arrangement is set up. I'm happily taken and in a committed relationship. As a female, I want to have a female friend as it gives a sense of predictability that is perfect for me. 

I believe we don't necessarily need to have the same interests, it only means that I can learn something new from you. I love listening to people :) 

But if it matters for you, I'm currently into reading books, intermittent fasting, podcasts about relationships and women's health, and I have an obsession over products that smell like coconut, be it lotion, perfume, etc. 

It's not something I'm into but I lately drink black coffee or tea as is just to see if I can tolerate it overtime. 
I hope it's random enough for you :)

Connecting to me may look like ((mostly)) voice call over Discord even while I work, it won't clash as I'm typically able to remain productive in that setting - unless I have a work meeting at that time which I can always update you with.
It may also look like me giving you a company doing whatever house chores you have or even when you're reading or submerging in to your other hobbies, I can be good around while staying silent as well. 

I typically get along well with f my age, if you're interested yoi can DM me with a lil bit of your info (age, time zone, lil bit of intro)

My wife, two kids and I flew into the Tulum airport where we rented a car. We had 2 reservations but decided to just walk up to a counter and see if we could get a better deal and we did. We paid $397 US dollars for a 10 day rental of a midsize car with full coverage bumper to bumper with zero deductible. We stayed at a penthouse Airbnb in the La Veleta neighborhood, which was amazing with zero issues. We spent most of the days driving between Tulum and PDC and hanging around Akumal beaches snorkeling  (cheap to get into and untouched, easy way to avoid beach clubs) or visiting xelha. We also went to 4 cenotes in that area and were blown away by how beautiful they are. We took a day trip to Chichén Itzá and hired a local guide to tour us around. We drove down to Bacalar and spent an extra 3 days there before leaving. 

Most of the eateries we visited were in the centro and ate for extremely cheap places. Great breakfast and coffee in those areas. 

We never once felt unsafe, we put over 2,000 KM on our rental in 10 days and were only stopped once by the guardia nacional, we told them we were tourist and they said have a safe trip. 

I was never scammed into paying anything extra at ruins or beaches. 

Tulum was one of the best vacations I’ve taken in a while and 100% making plans to return already. 

It’s Mexico and corruption and violence do exist but I never felt unsafe doing things I normally do in the US. ",1,1733445926.0,tulum,1,1.0,False

“Roks?” Adam said, but the controller replied it was not.  Adam went into panic mode as ran towards the admin building.

“Who are they?” He shouted into the communicator as he ran.

“I don’t know, but they are not moving, just hanging there, and they are on the wrong side too!”

Adam stopped and tried to understand what he was saying. “What do you mean the wrong side?”

“Adam? Why are there warships entering the system from the far side?” Evelyn said over the intercom, and Adam walked quickly to the admin building and saw the satellite images. Thirteen strange-looking warships were just hanging there waiting. The ships looked like giant wheelless cars but with extremely high energy readings.

“ I do not know who they are, Sir. The ships' design is not in the database.” The controller said. Suddenly, one of the ships moved forward and hovered over Dirt within a few seconds.

“We are being scanned! “ Jork said, and Adam snapped his fingers to get the attention, “Scan them back!”

“No hostile movement yet. It seems like they are just gathering information.” Over the intercom, Evelyn said she was currently on a human navy ship. We are ready, but I don’t think they are hostile. “  She said, and Adam had to agree. It seemed more like curiosity.

Then, the ship flew to Onic and started scanning the production and extraction before returning to Dirt.  Then, there was a beep on Adam’s pad, and the ship simply jumped into light sleep; the other ships also jumped away.  Everybody looked at each other, Adam looked at the Pad. It was a short message: ‘Good work, will be back!’

He immediately called the core group to his office at the back of the Administration office.

“So what the hell was that?“ Evelyn asked, and Jork and Vorts shrugged. Hara held her hand protective over her tummy, clearly showing her pregnancy now.

“The old ones?” She suggested, and they looked at her.

“The old ones are a myth,” Jork said, and Adam had to agree.

“Well, I've never seen this many energy readings, and the speed was beyond our capabilities. Our scans didn’t reveal anything. I mean, we scanned empty space.” Vorts replied, and they looked at the scans. The only things they had were video, energy, and radar readings.

Adam showed them the message, and they looked at him. “Okay, that is weird; how did they know to send it to you?” Hara said, and Adam smiled.

“I am listed as the project administrator and owner. How they located us is more worrisome, "" he replied, and Evelyn shook her head.

“Naw, that was border control. They were surprised to see us here but apparently didn’t mind for now. They might change their mind.” Evelyn replied. “Did we at least get their trajectory? So we can see where they were going?”

“Yeah, but that planet is 67 lightyears away, and we don’t have a hyperplane there.” Jork said. Adam looked at them, pondering the incident.

“So there is something out there that way, and they just dropped by. They didn’t destroy us, but I have a feeling they could have.”  He said and Evelyn nodded.

“Yeah, that would explain the fossilized structures. We need to know how long ago that was.” She turned to Jork, “Just out of curiosity, does the nitrogen have a fingerprint? I mean, is it possible to check if the Nitrogen on Onic was placed there by somebody?”

Jork looked at her and then to Vorts, who also shrugged. “We have to check with the academics. They might know. Why?”

“Well, she might be on to something. What if somebody moved all the nitrogen from the planet to Onic? It would be a perfect way to prevent people from moving in while you were away; as you keep saying, we can't bring life here because we don’t have any nitrogen.” Adam explained, and Evelyn nodded in agreement. They both thought about it. The planet must have had life, but everything was removed and left dead. The whole sector was dead. It seemed like somebody had used scorch-earth tactics on the whole sector. But why? Adam wondered about it.

“Oke, so is this a test of some sort then? If we fix it, will they be happy? Or angry?” Jork said, and Adam shrugged.

“Have no idea. We have to take the risk that they will be happy but prepare for them to be angry. We need an exit strategy.”

“Okay, that leads us to a few other things. Your city is almost finished.” Vorts said.

“What do you mean?” Adam said, confused.

“That domed city is almost finished; two thousand droids are working on it. It should be finished within a week.” Jork said.

“Wait, what? When did we get two thousand droids?” Adam sat up, confused, and Evelyn laughed.

“Boss, we currently have two droid factories that are spewing out a hundred droids an hour, and that number is just going to increase. I needed to test them out, so your project was ideal for that. The prison was finished three days ago and is connected to three farm domes and a shuttle facility. They should be able to make one a week.” Jork said, and Adam just looked at them confused, and Evelyn grinned.

“You keep forgetting that they want to impress them. It’s the same as the orphanage. They all came to you with their report cards. You signed all of them, remember? It’s the same here. He is just like little Samuel. Remember him?” Evelyn said as she nodded towards Jork. Adam looked at Jork, “Samuel, shitt…” Then he laughed as he got up and walked out of the office.

“Who is Samuel?” Jork asked. The two others looked eagerly to hear it.

“A kid at the orphanage he grew up in. He found out Adam liked playing chess, so he taught himself how to play and trained until he could beat everybody and won a few prizes as well; he was the first famous one of those kids and even got adopted later. But every time he won, he dedicated the win to Adam. All he wanted was to have Adam tell him he was a great kid, and every time Adam told him, he set himself a higher goal. Last I heard, he was a Chess master and poker champ, among others.  And he was not the only one. It was like they all wanted his praise, which is why so many of them got really good jobs when they left. Even the one that never met him, the one from that was stuck at other orphanages. They only saw the videos and read his messages of encouragements, Just getting message from him saying ‘keep up the good work’ or ‘I’m so proud of you’ was giving them bragging rights. He never knew but they all would work hard to prove to Adam that they could be successful, that he had given them a chance of a successful life. He kept saying the best revenge to the bastards is to be successful and forget them.“ She looked after him and grinned. “And all he wanted was for them to have a good life.”

“Well, I just want to repay what he gave me,” Jork said, and Evelyn laughed.

“You already have; he probably thinks he is in debt to you now; one smile is all it takes.” She said as Adam was sitting down in the admin going over the different projects. He seemed to ignore everything around him as he updated himself. Evelyn sighted.

“I know that look, he will go over everything now; find out everything so he knows who’s in need of help and who to encourage. “Then looking at the others, “And who to let loose to do their own thing.  It's what he does, it's what he has been doing for all the children of the orphanage since he was nine years old.”

“So what should we do?” Hara said and Evelyn smiled as she replied. “He is my worry now. I know how to deal with this, you guys just do your thing. This is what I was doing all those years. We where a team, we just need to get back at it.”

“What are you going to do?”  Jork asked, a little concerned.

“Kick his ass when he needs to take a break, talk him out of his worries and do some of the talking, but mostly drag him to bed. “She got up. “coffee?”

They realized the meeting was over and got to work. Evelyn got two cups and brought one to Adam. She sat down next to him, listened to him when he started to ponder the different hidden small projects, and now and then gave her comment. It looked like a well-oiled partnership that seemed to understand each other on a different level.

Hara stood at the door and looked at them as the priest walked by; he looked in at Adam and Evelyn. “So, the wife has arrived,” he said, and Hara simply nodded.

 

 

Two weeks later, seven ships returned from the battle. Roks was quite relaxed and content with the result.  Evelyn was shocked as she read the report and asked Adam if they needed to put Roks on a leash. Apparently, he had ripped people apart when they had boarded the ships. His tactics had worked perfectly, and the base was completely destroyed. He had taken four ships as his own and left the rest to be plundered by the competition.  Two of the ships were modern warships, and the other two were massive cargo haulers, five times the size of a dream; they would come to good use with the transport of droids. But the biggest surprise was the 7th ship, Kira and her crew had joined them.

Evelyn had put on her uniform and stood next to Adam as the shuttle landed and Roks and Kira came out.  Adam was very nervous as she waited, but when Kira saw Everlyn, her face beamed brightly, and Evelyn turned to Adam. “Why didn’t you tell me it was Kira Nam?”

“EVE!” Kira started running towards her and hugged her. “What the hell are you doing here?” Kira happy squealed.  

“I came to Adam. He ordered some droids.” She replied as she laughed, and Adam just looked between them, waiting for the chaos that would come; Roks came over and slapped his back.

”She insisted on checking if you got a good wife!” he said, and Adam gave a weak smile as he looked back at them. This was an undetonated grenade.

“Adam? You know he is one of mine, right?  Another of us escaped earth.” Kira said as she let her down, and Evelyn laughed. “Yeah, I know. Where is your sister? And you’re his Kira? God damnit. He is such an idiot! And dead.” Evelyn shoot him a glance.

Kira grinned and looked at Adam. “Yeah, but damn, he is good-looking,so.. wait, Sarah, oh, she went back to earth with her client. She will be back, just going to secure his safety. Anyway, Did you find Him? Las I heard you finally got the courage to go find Him again.”

“Yeah, I found him,” Evelyn said as she grinned at Adam. Kira turned to Adam as to excitingly explain what was going on.

“Do you know who she is? She is the ex-girlfriend of Number One.  I wish I had met her before they broke up, then I could have meet him too. Fuck the bureaucracy for putting me in London instead of Oslo.” Then Kira turned to Evelyn. “Well? Where is that glorious bastard hiding?”

“That’s him, Adam Wrangler. He is number one.” Evelyn said.

1h7occt,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1h7occt/andaz_papagayo_thoughts/,Andaz Papagayo Thoughts,"Recently stayed at Andaz Papagayo over Thanksgiving Holiday. Had posted earlier about trying to switch but points bookings at alternative hotels only showed up after the cancellation window ended. I know it's well reviewed but just wanted to add some thoughts and observations from my experience:

The resort is absolutely beautiful and the best designed Hyatt I have been in so far. It is an architectural masterpiece. It is not very accessible though and staying in building 5-7 would save you a lott of stairs.
 
Somehow was lucky enough to get an upgrade to the Andaz Suite during Thanksgiving which was amazing with great views and great bathroom and tub. A huge upgrade over the regular room which my parents had and would recommend SUA here.

Coffee class is great and we did the ATV excursion. Expensive (1100) but we were able to go to a remote beach that rivaled some of the best beaches I have been to such as Kalalau and Nacpan. Jet ski was fun and Playa Nasacolo is one of the best beaches to learn snorkeling but there's not really much to see.

I found the beaches to all be great and some of the negative comments overstated. The jungle to beach transition does lead to more branches and dirt but it is a unique landscape and playa nasacolo gives you a larger more traditional beach.

Breakfast is great but other food is hit or miss. Italian food at La Piazza was the only food we found to be actually good but it's only available some days. Rest of food was good but not great. New coffee shop opened up and the coffee is really good as are the cookies. 

Food was also expensive but to be fair the entire coast of Guanacaste (Coco, Tamarindo, etc) was ridiculously priced. Food was regularly more expensive than New York City (coffee for 6-7 dollars, nachos for 18, small arepa for 16). Looking at photos of old menus, it looks like there has been a huge shift upwards in pricing in the entire coastline. At those prices, there are better options in other parts of the world. Even Hawaii felt more affordable/reasonable! I expected it to be expensive but at those rates it felt like such a rip off that the hotel felt reasonable in retrospect.

Overall, I loved the hotel. Fantastic escape from the cold.

So in Da2, we know that Anders and Justice eventually merge, and depending on your choices, Justice becomes Vengeance.

(A benevolent spirit becoming the opposite side of its coin)

Anders himself even states that he can't tell the difference anymore.

However Justice doesn't take over Anders when he sleeps, only in times of emotions, or when Anders let's him. 

Either way, Justice will often take over Anders, and essentially seems to be losing his mind. 

(Varric mentions this in Dai if you let Anders live (and Hawke romance), that Anders will reunite with Hawke unless he's been killed or driven mad) 

So we can deduce that Anders & Justice have essentially merged, and it's an ongoing battle for Anders to retain himself as much as possible. (Though Anders himself refers to himself as a ""we"" no one else can) 

Now coming to Dav. 

We find out that Lucanis has made a deal with Spite, who most assuredly is NOT starting off at least on the benevolent side. 

Lucanis is taken over by Spite often, there is a constant battle for control. To the point where Lucanis avoids sleeping because Spite will take control.

(Putting aside the obvious that this makes little sense, it would just make Lucanis sleep deprived and more susceptible to being possessed. I don't know why they didn't use potions instead, or just tie him down or lock him up when he wishes to sleep. Feels like coffee is his core personality.)

Spite seems to come off more as a companion spirit then anything else. Other companions are able to order him around like a dog, and he listens to them. (Example: Taash) despite seeming to battle for control way more, he seems also strangely docile

Lucanis doesn't seen to be losing his mind, not even if you choose to let his city be destroyed. 


So my question is, is there a reason Lucanis was able to stay sane when Anders was not? Or is it a case of it hasn't been enough time yet for Lucanis to spiral. (He certainly has enough emotional moments, but in Da2 Anders has 10 years to degrade) 

I would think being tortured for years would land Lucanis in a similar headspace as Anders in terms of trauma and anger. 

(Though considering that seems glossed over as well, I am not surprised.)

I guess what I'm asking if for someone to please tell me I missed something, and/or explain this to me in a way that makes it make more sense. (Please) ",1,1733444570.0,dragonage,1,1.0,False

My mom, let’s call her Kasey, has habits of telling me to get a job or apply, but then immediately constantly tell me to quite or say its a bad idea, or ‘you should wait till after blah blah blah,’ and so on. 
 
My father, place name Ronny, constantly belittles me and doesn’t appreciate what I used to do at the house, telling me he ‘lives in the real world.’ Note Kasey is a clean freak, I had to clean the house every day, vacuuming daily, mopping every other day, move furniture to get under everything, dishes, coffee, beds, bathrooms, dusting surfaces and ceiling fans and base boards, wiping every surface off and so on. As well as pick up snot rags and other trash they leave out. Even when I felt accomplished Kasey would come home and criticize everything, saying I didn’t do it right, or it wasn’t up to her standards. This led to me becoming lazy and not doing as well as I used to, I’ll be honest.

 I know since I am an adult I should be able to go and do whatever, but here are some reasons I’m finding it difficult. When I first graduated I applied to college, even won a few free thousands off from a contest… Kasey convinced me to not go.. cause they needed someone to stay home and clean and make sure no one did anything wrong while they built their new house. When I got a job… I only did weekends because I hadn’t been taught to drive, had to beg them to even take me to practice. So I needed to be dropped off. This became a fight almost all the time. It only lasted less than a year or so before I was forced to quit. Kasey also holds things over me, such as kicking me out whenever I do anything she doesn’t like or if she feels I’m being disrespectful. She even once shoved a camera into my face to record me to show if I argue, but her personality completely changes from talking down to me to sounding calm and like I’m the sole issue.

  When I got my license and my car, Kasey and my father park so that I can’t drive whenever I want or need, I have to ask for them to move their cars, (I don’t know where they leave the keys… and I doubt taking them and moving their cars would end well.) and usually that ends with her saying no, fighting and or rescheduling my plans so that she can come with me. Which prevents me from doing things I need to, such as apartment hunt or go to interviews. It’s become so exhausting to even try, I used to clean the house and get paid, but they no longer do that and count it as rent. 

Any jobs recently have been shitty and don’t pay enough to pay for my car and rent, let alone move out. Kasey has also convinced me to quit then, berating me for quitting, acting as if she wasn’t the one to tell me to. 

 I used to do art commissions and other small things remotely to earn money, but it’s not enough to move out. Also recently my health is getting worse, but I can’t get proper appointments to see if it’s serious due to these restrictions. I need help but I’m not the brightest as you can probably tell, so I came here. If anyone had advice I’d greatly appreciate it.",1,1733444368.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

At 18 I stopped taking it and did not start back up again until 2 years ago, im now in my early 30s. This time did a proper neurological exam and reconfirmed an ADHD diagnosis.

I am on the lowest dose of adderall, 10mg for instant release or 20mg for extended release, and even sometimes slice the tablets for less. I will admit that sometimes yes I do also have a small cup of coffee in the morning too, but sometimes not. I've experimented with and without caffeine, with and without hydrating with water, with and without a full stomach, all the combinations you could think of.

When I take adderall, it truly helps my brain function, feel sooo much better on it. Feel like a sack of useless shit without it, no motivation. But when im on it, im SWEATING, my jaw muscles are STIFF and solid as a rock, when I talk I am ranting and never shut up, sometimes my heart rate and breathing rate are elevated, something is off and I don't feel right.

I have tried ashwaganda and lions mane and although they have offered a bit of help, unfortunately it's not enough or sometimes not at all. I've seen a therapist for a very long time and think I do a decent job of managing any anxiety.

I got home from my in-office job yesterday and sat down on my couch in attempt to relax. I immediately notice an item on my coffee table I know isn’t mine— a clean paper condiment cup you get at fast food places for ketchup and such.

issue is, I haven’t been out to eat in days and haven’t used one of those in likely years. plus I used the coffee table for a project the night before and would have noticed.

my stomach immediately dropped as that’s the only thing on my coffee table, I had cleaned everything up the night before. 

I live in an apartment and had some maintenance done a few weeks ago. at that time, I was out of town. unfortunately, I come home to my door unlocked, which it had been for days.

I call the leasing office today asking if any maintenance had been done in my apartment yesterday, to which they answered no. I didn’t have any open tickets, nor a clock in/clock out sheet maintenance usually leaves.

I had them come and change my locks today and ordered a camera just in case.

no one has ever had my spare keys and I don’t have a crazy ex or stalker to my knowledge. I also don’t see anything missing. 

the only explanation I have is one of the maintenance workers was in my apartment to hang and eat lunch or something.

1h7o5rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1h7o5rh/processingfeelingsbitterness/,Processing/Feelings/Bitterness,"I am writing this to seek insight and advice on something that happened to me today; or rather, some thoughts that I had that I am struggling with. 

I was at my favorite coffee shop and two women were leaving, each with a toddler in their arms. One woman made a clever joke to the other that I thought was really funny. This thought crossed my mind; ‘She seems so funny and smart, I want to be her friend. Not like those other Moms, ugh.’ And for a moment, a split second really, I was overwhelmed with feelings of absolute seething hatred for women who can have children. Every single one of them. It faded in an instant and was replaced with a feeling of self hatred, of shame. I imagined myself turning into a bitter old woman who shakes her cane at children, or posts hateful rants on r/childfree. It didn’t even make any sense; many of my friends and loved ones are mothers. Some of them will surely become mothers soon and it will not turn them into different people. I am happy for them and want them to have good things. I’ve been thinking about it all day and wondering if what I was actually feeling was envy that my hormonally addled brain interpreted as hatred, disdain and bitterness. 

To back up a little; I am four weeks post-hysterectomy. I’m pretty sure I’m having some hormonal fluctuations (despite having kept my ovaries) that might be making me a little crazy. The hysterectomy had to happen, but it was a long road for me to accept that. I had been struggling with….pretty much all of the possible health problems that can come with female reproductive organs, and for years. I was so tired. My quality of life was in the toilet. Every aspect of my life was suffering, from my work, to my love life, even to neglecting my pets. I felt like I had tried every possible alternative. I had seen all of the doctors. They all told me that I could not be helped except by hysterectomy.  

In many ways I felt like it shouldn’t be that big a deal. I have always thought of myself as an independent person. I didn’t ever really fantasize about getting married or having children. If it happened that would have been okay, but I wasn’t longing for it. Nor have I ever disliked children. I love my niblings very much and enjoy kids, I think they’re cute and all, but usually after an extended period of time around kids I would think “Yeah, I don’t need that for myself”. I thought that it would ultimately be liberating, and that I would enjoy the freedom of being able to travel, do what I like, etc, without being tied down. I also think that there are many valid and wonderful ways to become a parent other than the DIY version. I could (if I choose) adopt, become a step-parent, or (being bisexual) I might even find a female partner who gets pregnant, or some combination of those options. I actually was a little afraid of being pregnant. I also believe it is a valid choice not to want children, which I think is where I land. So all should be good, right?

The hysterectomy has been mostly positive and I am already starting to feel better. The surgeon was excellent. But one aspect has absolutely sucked; the timing. The actual procedure happened the day after the election (in the US) and I was so overwhelmed I basically shut down and didn’t let myself think about it. About a week afterwards I discovered a friend I was once close with had died (probably by suicide). I have lost a great many friends and loved ones over the years and sometimes I feel cursed with loss and grief. It also came on the heels of a break-up, which I have to admit may have devastated me more than all the other things combined. I felt powerful loneliness. I’ve been single for most of my life and dealt with many difficult things on my own. I think that I’m a strong person, but in low moments I’ve thought ‘I wish there was someone here with me to lean on’. And while children weren’t something I really wanted, deep down I feel truly angry that I didn’t have a choice in the matter. 

So all of that is why that moment freaked me out so badly. I think my grief, loneliness, and anger coalesced into something else. It made me someone I don’t like. I don’t want to be hateful, jealous or bitter. I guess what I’m asking for is advice on how not to descend into that any further. I’m trying hard to be positive, but at times I just…..can’t.

The moment I laid eyes on the box, I felt a mix of excitement and curiosity. It was like waiting for a surprise party, but this time, I was the guest of honor. The box was surprisingly hefty, which made me think, “Okay, this better be good!” The sleek design on the packaging hinted at something special inside. I mean, who doesn’t love a little flair, right?

As I pried the box open, I was greeted with a whiff of fresh plastic and a hint of newness that screamed, “I’m ready to change your life!” The chair was carefully packed, nestled like a baby in a crib. I couldn’t help but admire the quality of the materials. The fabric felt soft yet durable, and the colors were vibrant without being too flashy. It was like the chair was saying, “I’m classy, but I can still party!”

Once I started pulling out the pieces, I noticed the thoughtful design elements. The ergonomic shape looked inviting, almost like it was giving me a little wave, saying, “Hey there, sit on me!” I was already picturing my future workdays, free from the back pain that had become my annoying sidekick. Honestly, I felt like I was unboxing a piece of furniture with a personality.

## Assembly: A DIY Adventure

As I pulled the box into my living room, I felt a mix of excitement and dread. The assembly of my new ergonomic desk chair was about to begin, and I had a sneaking suspicion it might turn into a DIY adventure worthy of its own reality show. The first thing I noticed was the sheer number of parts. I mean, who knew a chair could have so many pieces? It was like a puzzle, but one that could potentially leave me with a sore back if I didn’t get it right.

I laid everything out on the floor like a surgeon preparing for an operation. There were wheels, bolts, and what looked like a spaceship control panel. I glanced at the instructions, which were surprisingly straightforward—thank goodness! I thought I might need a degree in engineering, but it turned out to be more like assembling IKEA furniture, minus the Swedish meatballs.

Halfway through, I realized I had put the armrests on backward. Classic rookie mistake! As I unscrewed them, I couldn’t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. My cat, Mr. Whiskers, decided this was the perfect time to “help” by sitting right on the instruction manual. Thanks, buddy. 

After a bit of back-and-forth with the screws, I finally got it together. And let me tell you, the moment I sat down was pure bliss. It was like sitting on a cloud—well, a cloud with wheels!

## The Ergonomic Experience: A Spine's Delight

The moment I sank into the chair, I felt like I was being embraced by a cloud of comfort—seriously, it was like my spine was getting a warm hug. Now, let me tell you, my old chair was a real backstabber, quite literally. It was the kind of chair that made you question your life choices after just a few hours of sitting. You know the type: squeaky, wobbly, and about as supportive as a wet noodle. 

But the Kerdom chair? Oh boy! It’s designed with a focus on ergonomics that genuinely made a difference. The lumbar support hugged my lower back just right. I could feel the tension melting away as I settled in. And the adjustable height? It was like finding the perfect position for my legs—no more feeling like I was perched on a stool meant for a toddler. 

After a week of use, I noticed a remarkable change. My usual back pain? Gone! I could sit for hours without the familiar ache creeping in. It was like I had traded in my old chair for a throne. Seriously, who knew that a good chair could turn my workspace into a mini spa for my spine? If only it could make coffee too!

## Customization: The Kerdom's Magic Trick

Customization is where the magic happens with this chair. Seriously, it’s like having a personal tailor for your backside! When I first sat in it, I felt like Goldilocks trying to find the “just right” fit. I twisted knobs, pulled levers, and adjusted everything until I found my sweet spot. 

The first thing I tackled was the seat height. I’m not the tallest person, so I made sure my feet were flat on the ground. Nothing worse than dangling like a cartoon character! Then, I adjusted the backrest. I like a little support for my lower back, so I moved it up a notch. It felt like a gentle hug, which is exactly what I needed after long hours of sitting.

One thing I learned? Don’t be afraid to play around with the armrests. I found that having them at a slight angle helped keep my shoulders relaxed. And let’s not forget the tilt tension—too tight, and you’ll feel like you’re in a rollercoaster; too loose, and you might just fall back in surprise! 

So, my tip for you? Take your time and experiment. Every body is different, and finding your perfect settings can transform your work-from-home experience from “ouch” to “ahh.” Trust me, it’s worth the effort!

## Long-Term Comfort: A Test of Time

When I first plopped down in my new chair, I didn’t think much about the long haul. But here I am, months later, still sitting pretty and feeling pretty good about it. You know how sometimes you buy something and it looks great at first, but then it starts to look like it’s been through a battle with a herd of elephants? Well, I’m happy to report that my chair has been more like a trusty steed than a war-torn relic.

After several months of daily use, I’ve kept an eye out for any signs of wear and tear. The fabric? Still looking fresh, not a single coffee stain in sight—thank you, clumsiness avoidance skills! The cushions haven’t flattened out like a pancake either. They still have that nice bounce, which is a miracle considering how many hours I’ve spent in it. I mean, if my chair had a social life, it would definitely be tired of me by now.

The adjustments? They still work like a charm. I can still find that sweet spot where my back feels supported, and my legs don’t start to resemble jelly. It’s like the chair is saying, “Hey, I got your back—literally!” So, if you’re wondering whether this chair can stand the test of time, I’d say it’s passed with flying colors. I just hope it doesn’t start charging me rent anytime soon!

## The Kerdom vs. The Competition: Why I'm Sold

When it comes to ergonomic chairs, the competition can be fierce, but let me tell you, the Kerdom really stands out in a sea of sameness. I’ve tried a bunch of chairs over the years—some that felt like sitting on a rock and others that practically swallowed me whole. But the Kerdom? It’s like a warm hug for my back. 

First off, let’s talk about comfort. While some chairs feel like they’re trying to mimic a throne, the Kerdom strikes a perfect balance. It’s not too soft, not too firm—just right, like Goldilocks would say. The lumbar support is a game-changer. I mean, I could practically hear my spine sigh with relief the first time I sank into it.

Now, I’ve had my fair share of chairs that promised the world but delivered a sore back instead. The Kerdom, however, has this nifty adjustable feature that lets you customize the height and tilt. It’s like having a personal assistant for your posture! Plus, the breathable mesh keeps me cool during those intense Zoom meetings where I pretend to be paying attention. 

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for a chair that won’t leave you feeling like you’ve been through a wrestling match, I’d say the Kerdom is worth every penny. Give it a try; your back will thank you!

## Conclusions
  
  
So, there you have it, folks! The Kerdom ergonomic desk chair has been a literal lifesaver for this work-from-home warrior. It's not just about preventing back pain; it's about gaining comfort and productivity. If you're considering an upgrade, I'd say, go for it! Your spine will thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me, my chair and I have some serious Netflix binging to catch up on.",1,1733443541.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

A storm you have to wade through before your life can go back to clear blue skies. That’s a lie. In my experience, grief is a cold and lonely home you live in. Over time you simply get used to the draft and creaky floorboards of it all. But the home stays the same nonetheless.

The apartment felt bigger after Lily died. Every room echoed with her absence. Every piece of furniture reminded me of lost moments at her side. There was no escaping it. For weeks, I barely left the apartment at all. I wore her favorite hoodie until it stopped smelling like her. I cooked her favorite meals just to throw them away when grief became stronger than hunger. I stopped answering the phone.

That's where I was— knee deep in the wreckage of denial and no closer to the rumoured 'blue skies' of acceptance than I had been weeks prior— when the package came.

It was a small box, wrapped in plain brown paper with no return address. The handwriting on the label was uneven, shaky, as if whoever wrote it had trembling hands. I didn't recognize it but it barely mattered to me at the time. I had been running on autopilot for so long that I couldn't have paid attention even if I had wanted to.

Inside was a candle, thick and heavy, its pale blue surface covered in neatly carved patterns of sorts. Intertwined vines and flowers. There was no note, no explanation, just the candle that smelled faintly of lavender. The scent alone made my eyes burn with tears my body couldn't shed anymore, the well running dry. Lily had always had this quirky habit of leaving a small bundle of dried lavender stems in her drawers so all her clothes would be imbued by the calming smell of it. The flower, and its' scent, had become synonymous with her name long ago, the two inextricable from one another.

I didn't think much of it at first. People had sent me all sorts of things since the funeral— flowers, condolences written on generic postcards, books about grief and loss, even the occasional casserole or pie. I assumed it was just another gift from someone who didn’t know what else to say to get me out of this funk, or what else to do to help me.

What good would a candle do when the one thing I needed, I could never have again?

I still lit it that night, craving for the smell of lavender to float through the living room once more. The flame flickered blue for a moment before settling into a soft, steady glow. The scent filled the room, rich, almost intoxicating. Nostalgic. I stared at the flame for a long second, inhaling deeply, feeling every muscle in my body loosen from the lavender's relaxing effects before knotting themselves up again at the myriad of memories it brought up.

After a while I managed to pry my eyes away without completely losing it and bursting into sobs right there, only for me to walk in the kitchen, ready to prepare Lily's favorite pesto recipe for the third night in a row, even though I hadn't tasted it once in all those days.

And then I heard it.

At first, it was barely a whisper, just the breath of a sound in that same way grief sometimes made you hear footsteps and phantom laughter in empty houses. My heart was heavy, heavier even than the day before, or the one before that. After all, I had heard her voice many times since the accident. All figments of my imagination, all memories haunting and taunting me. I tried to hang on to that reality, *my* reality, and busy myself with the food, but that hint of a whisper floated by my ear again and again until I had no other choice but to pay attention, knowing that it was all in my head and would inevitably hurt me more.

""Sarah?""

My body froze, my heart jumped, the spoon slipping from my fingers and clamoring down against the marble counter. I had never heard her so clearly before, the sound so pure and melodic compared to the muddled, muffled version my mind always conjured. It sounded just like her, every day, calling my name from the living room to ask if I wanted a refill for my wine glass, even though she knew it still stood half-full on the coffee table. It sounded like the real Lily. Not my version of her. Not my memory of her. Not my deluded visions of her. It sounded like *her*.

My own voice creaked. ""Lily?""

The whisper came again, soft and hesitant, like she wasn’t sure I could hear her. “I’m here.”

I whipped my head around, trying to find her, to see her, to grasp at anything I could that would prove it wasn't all in my head, not this time. But there was nothing there. Just the empty couch, in the empty living room of the empty apartment. The empty space as still as it had always been since Lily died. The empty, and the candle, its' flame swaying gently with the rhythm of an invisible breeze.

“Lily? Is that really you?” I asked, taking a few steps towards the candle, each movement so tense, so minute, careful not to accidentally blow the flame.

I could have lost my mind entirely but I was past the point of caring, past the point of wanting to rationalize it all. If insanity was the path to reuniting with her, I would've walked it a million times over in that moment.

“Sarah... I’m here.” Her voice trembled, barely audible, like a breath carried by the candle’s flame as it swayed with each word. “God, I've missed you.""

""H-How? You're... gone. It can't be...""

“You lit the candle for me."" that bright chuckle of hers, the one that always punctuated her words when she thought I had said something silly, warmed the room in an instant, and my heart with it. ""I don’t know how, but I’m here and I’ve been waiting so long to talk to you again, lovely.”

\_\_\_

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat by the candle, listening to her whispered words— her calling my name, or humming the tune of our favorite song. It felt like a dream, one I had had for so many nights in a row, finally seeping into reality. Like I’d fallen into some half-conscious state where anything was possible, where Lily, *my* Lily, was by my side once more.

I tried to tell myself that it was all a trick , that it was just my mind playing cruel games. I really did. But the seconds ticked by, the minutes even, and that sweet lilting voice kept on going, talking and talking about everything, anything, nothing—jokes we shared, stories we told. The way she teased me about my terrible cooking, the pet names she used when no one else was around.

By the time the sun rose, I was crying. For the first time since the funeral, I wasn’t crying out of despair, desperate to feel her warmth and her love once more. But because she finally didn't feel so far away anymore, for the first time in too long, she felt like she was right at my fingertips. Even if I couldn't see her. Even if I couldn't touch her. Even if I had made it all up, my mind finally broken by grief and denial. She was with me and nothing else in the world seemed to matter more than that.

\_\_\_

For a while after that, the days seemed to blur together a little. As I had always done, I would force myself to go about my day— my leave of absence from work had ended over a week ago and still it was torture dragging myself out of my misery long enough not to end up unemployed. Every night when I came home, I lit the candle, and every night she spoke to me.

The flame burned and danced steadily, the wax melting and the pillar shrinking slower than it should have. She told me about memories I’d forgotten—our trip to the coast, the way we got lost in that tiny town and ended up laughing and kissing in the rain.

She told me she missed me, that she was proud of me for holding on.

It was comforting at first, like finding a piece of her I thought was lost to me forever. Coming home and telling her about my day, listening to her talk herself silly about one thing or another. It was different than before and yet, in all the ways it mattered, it was the same routine. The same Lily.

God, I wish it had stayed that way.

But one night, after I had gotten home late from a bad shift, wanting too see and hear from nobody but her and drown in her presence some more for as long as I could until the sun would inevitably cut our time short again, she suddenly asked me why I hadn’t been in the car with her that day.

“You were supposed to be there,” she said, her voice sharper than I’d ever heard it. ""It was raining, you *always* drive on rainy days.""

I tried to argue, to explain that I was stuck at work, that the weather report had assured me it would be sunny for the entire week-end, that I didn’t know she was going to take that road. But the words felt hollow and meaningless. I didn't want to rehash what had happened, didn't want to think about the worst day of my life all over again. What excuse could I possibly make when she was the one who had lost her life that day, because I was late, because I texted her to drive there ahead of me, because I left her alone.

“You didn’t even call,” she said, and all I could do was hang my head in shame.

\_\_\_

The next night and the night after that, she brought up things I’d never told anyone—times I’d been too tired to join her on her adventures, times I’d secretly resented her for being so alive when I felt like I was barely holding on. She seemed so unhappy with me, so bitter. I wanted her to laugh, to make her silly jokes, to be as lively as she had always been. Before she died I took all of it for granted but now I couldn't bare to hear the disappointment and hurt in her voice, and yet more and more it was all she seemed willing to offer me.

""You don't visit me anymore..."" she breathed one evening.

""I... I can't go to your grave Lily. It's too much...""

""Too much for you?"" she scoffed. ""I'm the one that's buried in that pile of dirt"".

The candle fluttered, the flame swaying before shrinking quickly, as if mirroring Lily's temper and her tone of voice. I was so afraid it would blow itself out and Lily would be gone again. Even with the anger in her voice, even with the reproach, I needed her. Anything but the empty silence again.

""You know how much I love you, it's just-"" I tried to appease her.

""Do I?"" her voice cut me off from thin air. ""Because you weren't there that day, Sarah. You should've been with me on our anniversary, and you weren't.""

I could feel my breath catching, my throat seizing and closing around the guilt that obstructed it. She was right. It didn't matter that I hadn't known that night would turn out the way it did, when it mattered the most I hadn't been there. I was a horrible person, and an even worse partner. I had always known that. It hurt to hear she had known it too.

""I knew you wouldn't be there."" she whispered before her voice disappeared.

I didn't hear from her again that night. I was besides myself. I had no time to give myself pity, to feel sorry for what had been said to me, for the truths I had to come to terms with. I was too terrified that I would never hear her again, that she would never come to me again. All I wanted was her voice, always and forever. I needed it more than I needed air. More than I needed sanity. Little did I know imagine that I could ever regret this wish being granted.

\_\_\_

She did come back after that night. Every time I lit the candle, she was there. Every time she talked and every day her words would hurt a little more, and even then I couldn't bring myself to think it wasn't all worth it.

""You used to hate me, didn't you, lovely?"" she asked once. ""How free spirited I was. How I lived life.""

""What? No! I loved that about you... I-""

“Don’t lie to me, Sarah. I saw the way you looked at me. You thought I was selfish. Reckless."" her voice sounded so bitter, so malicious almost, as if she started to enjoy seeing the hurt each word marked on my soul. ""You didn’t say anything because you wanted me to love you. But deep down, you thought I’d burn out, didn’t you? You thought I’d ruin myself.”

I hiccuped between sobs. ""Stop it. You’re twisting things.”

""Do you remember the last thing you said to me?

""I- I said I loved you..."" I manage to form the words.

She clicked her tongue, or at least it sounded like it, as if she was chastising a kid for getting an answer wrong. For lying. ""No, Sarah. You told me I was a burden. You told me I was too much.”

My head spun, my heart racing as I tried so hard to remember. I had done my best to forget that day completely, to expunge from my memory the moment I had received the call about the accident and the blur of moments that followed. We had had a fight that day and I barely recalled what it was about anymore, it didn't seem to matter when it had become too late for me to tell her how sorry I was.

“I didn’t mean it like that! I was just upset, Lily, please.”

""You meant every word."" she spat. ""I replay them in my head every second I’m down here. ‘Why can’t you just take care of yourself for once, Lily?’ That’s what you said. That’s how you left me.”

""Stop it. Stop it, please."" I begged and begged, tears running down my face, illuminated only by the candle amidst the total darkness the living room had fallen into.

""I’m telling you the truth. You didn't love me. You tolerated me, pitied me."" Lily's voice seemed to sigh, a mocking sound, as if she was the one pitying me now, looking down on me like she felt I had looked down on her. ""It was easier to let me die than to watch me live, wasn't it?""

\_\_\_

By the third week, I was afraid to light the candle, to hear her accusations knowing all of them were true, even the ones I didn't believe. She couldn't be wrong about me, she had always known me better than anyone. Day after day I became more horrified about the person she thought I was and more terrified still that this angry, evil version of her was slowly tainting the image of *my* Lily that resided in my mind, completely. Still I couldn’t stop myself. Her voice was like a drug, and I was too far gone to pull away.

The whispers grew darker, angrier. She accused me of things I didn’t remember, things I didn’t believe I could do. She said she could see me from wherever she was, that she watched me every day, that she knew the thoughts I tried to bury. That I couldn't escape what I had thought, what I had done, more than I could escape her.

""Do you want to know what it feels like, Sarah? Dying alone?"" she mused, like an eerie whisper floating in the air and making the flame dance along.

I didn't want to know, I didn't want to hear. I wanted Lily, my Lily, the one who smiled and laughed but that Lily could barely hang on in my mind anymore, all there was was this, this voice, those words, the horrors it scarred in my memory. And I was a willing victim to it all. She knew it. So she kept talking despite the tears already staining my face.

""The moment I died, it felt like being swallowed alive by razors, like my own skin peeled back layer by layer, and I can *feel* it still, every second. It doesn’t stop, Sarah. It never stops."" the sound of her laughter was pure evil, it was the only word I could equate it to. ""And the dark—oh it’s alive, slithering over me, into me, filling every crack of my body and soul, swallowing my spirit, leaving me there to drown over and over, eternally.""

As her voice kept on going, I wanted to bring my hands to my ears, I wanted to stop the words, I didn't want to hear it anymore, to imagine the torture she suffered while I wallowed in my own self-pity for the last few weeks since her death. But Lily was unrelenting. She wanted me to know. She wanted me to hurt.

""And do you know what the worst part is? It’s not the pain. It’s not the suffocating dark. It’s the way I *remember.* The way I see you, alive, moving on while I'm *rotting,* Sarah. Because of you. And every time you light this candle, it *pulls* me back through it. All of it. You’re the one twisting the knife, over and over.""

""I won't light it again! I won't do it anymore! Please!""

I yelled at the top of my lungs. I couldn't bare the thought, I couldn't have more of her pain on my hands. I didn't care if the neighbours heard me, if they thought I had gone insane. For all intent and purposes I had. I just wanted it to *stop.*

""*DON'T YOU* ***DARE*** *LET ME GO*""

The sound roared in the entire apartment, deafening, guttural and absolutely horrifying. It wasn't her voice. Not the sweet lilt of her tone, not the gentle inflection she always used on the wrong syllable, not the faint Swedish accent she could never quite get rid of. It wasn't *my* Lily. It sounded like pure evil, like the pits of hell groaning and moaning as the opened, all condensed into one voice.

The wax began to bubble and hiss, spilling over the edges of the candle and onto the white surface of the coffee table. I had never noticed before how the wax never ran down the length of the candle this whole time. I chose not to see it, how unnatural it was. The scent of smoke filled the room, choking me, burning my eyes, my lungs, my heart.

Her screams filled the room, rising to an unbearable pitch. I fell to my knees, clutching my ears, begging her to stop. I could hear her fear as the car swerved off the road, her pain as it tumbled down the roadside cliff, breaking every single bone until she was left there to drown in her own blood filling her throat. And then I could hear the thing, the demon that had played its part, that had taken her place, its' horrible gurgling screams of rage making me crumble onto myself.

""Watching you fall and die is all I have left!"" it bellowed between ear piercing screeches. ""Die for me, lovely. *Die. Die. Die.*""

\_\_\_

I can barely remember finding the strength to get up, let alone the strength to blow the candle out. The only thing that still spurred my body and its broken, shattered spirit, was knowing that the Lily I had known, the one I had loved — even if I had loved her all wrong, loved her too little — would have never wanted to hurt me this way. Thinking about how horrified she would be to even imagine it, I found it in myself to put a stop to it all. Even if the damages were already more than done.

The candle sits on my shelf now, its wax hardened into jagged, unnatural shapes. I can still hear her voice sometimes, faint and distant, like a radio station that won’t quite tune in. I don’t light it anymore. I don’t think I could survive hearing the screams, but no matter how hard I try, I never can bring myself to get rid of it completely. Not when I can have the prospect of her voice again, right there, just in my grasp.

I know it's not my Lily, but I don't think it matters anymore. The horrible things it said, the harm it wished on me, I deserve them all for leaving her alone that night. I know that now. I am to blame and I will bare that burden. And one day soon, when I'm ready, I will light this candle again and I will let this entity, this Lily, do with me as it pleases, so I can finally reunite with *my* Lily and suffer through the eons of pain that I deserve, never leaving her side this time around.

If dying is the only path to her, then so be it, I will take it without a second thought.

I have been facing challenges when my partner raises their tone and start swearing, and I have had to leave their house. I am being labelled as abusive for leaving the conversation - how can I manage those situations?

In the latest example today:
- I came to visit my partner at their house, brought coffee and we started discussing pleasantly.
- they changed topic to start a long monologue about a book they read and with all the caveat “this may be incorrect” they started attributing me with an attachment style and told me the author called it unhealthy.
- I waited for my turn to speak, thank them for their insights and told them I was feeling uneasy about a conversation centered on me, describing me as “unhealthy” and I wanted to acknowledge I was not comfortable.
- they responded with some strong validation before switching to a “but” statement and defending the situation and advocating for themselves in a way that minimised the validation.
- I focused on I-statement explaining that the discussion felt more and more uncomfortable.
- they raised their tone and starting swearing while grabbing items around them in an accelerated way…
- I had a panic attack, apologised and left.

Any tips on how to manage this sort of situation?",1,1733443093.0,relationshipadvice,2,1.0,False

Chapter 4

Tilraf, Arxur defector

Date: October 24th Time: 5:30pm

I stepped out of the human vehicle and into a rainy landscape. I stood on a gravel drive in front of a small 2 story home. The house was brick with a large, thatched roof. Behind it was rolling fields of what seemed to be vegetables.

*If you didn’t know, this could easily be passed off as some rural prey planet.* Cold rain sent shivers down my spine as a bitter breeze flowed around me. The sky was covered in a thick layer of grey clouds.

*So this is where Hanna lives. I didn’t really know what to expect, but I didn’t really think it would be this.* The home was isolated, sitting about 500 meters from the nearest road. About a kilometre to the south was a small village.

It had seemed much more idyllic then the villages I had seen on Wriss. There was no execution square or cattle pens. Instead, there had been a well kept green with a few shops. However, there had been a large stone building with a tall spire near the green. It had looked like a small betterment office.

*Maybe it’s the human’s version of such an organisation?* I felt some unease at that. That was the last thing I wanted to deal with at the moment. “Shall we continue?”

I turned to look at the police officer who had driven me to Hannas home. He had picked me up from the city known as Manchester. I had tried to talk to him, but the man had simply ignored me. Looking now, I could see that his fists were clenched slightly.  He had an impassive expression on his face but his eyes told a different story. They flared with apparent hatred. Hatred that could have only been intended for one person. Me. *He must be able to see that I’m a weakling.*

I trudged forwards following the officer to the front door. He knocked twice announcing our presence to the occupant. There was some shuffling inside before an audible clunk marked the opening of the door. “Ah Constable Roberts, a pleasure to see you”.

The ‘constable’ simply huffed. “Your, little…..lizard is here.” He gestured to me. Hanna’s face turned into a scowl.

“Thanks Charlie, I hope your wife’s doing well back in London”. The man opened his mouth to speak but instead just huffed again. He turned and walked away shooting me a stare as he walked back to his bright yellow car.

Hanna gestured for me to enter so I did. “Don’t mind him” she said as she closed the door behind me. “He’s just scared at the moment. We all are”. Hanna led me into a room with a guiding hand. My tail swished slightly at her touch. It felt right. *By the hunter, what has gotten into me.* The room was large with two plush sofas and several other bits of furniture strewn around. The far wall had a TV mounted above a roaring fireplace. The fire did much to help warm my cold feet.

Hanna sat me down on a sofa before sitting on a chair opposite me. she quickly poured two cups of tea from a pot on a nearby coffee table. “So Tilraf, have you been told what’s going on?”

She pushed a cup towards me before taking a sip from her own. I picked mine up mimicking her. I grimaced at the taste of milk and quickly put the cup down. “Um, no” I said. After leaving the camp I had sat in holding cell for a few days. After that I had been put on a military flight. Some hours later I had landed at Manchester. From there I had been taken by the Constable to here.

Hanna sighed and pinched her brow.  *Have I upset her?* “I’m sorry” I said. She shook her head. “Don’t apologise I’m not angry at you. Just at the UN for treating you so poorly.”  I looked down at the carpet. *They treated me poorly ? I thought that was normal.*

A thought occurred to me. *Why am I here? What do I do now?*  I had been so focused on defecting and surviving that now that I was out, I had no idea what to do with myself. “Hanna, why am I here? Why are you here?

Hanna shrugged; “I am here because I volunteered to be your handler. To help you reintegrate into normal society. You are here because this is my home and it’s a good location for you to stay out of trouble.”

“Oh, um thank you for helping me”. The sentence felt wrong and right at the same time. Right in the fact that it was true, and I genuinely meant it. Wrong due to the fact it felt weird to say. I felt awkward, saying these things, acting so kind. A part of me was still screaming at me to stop. To put up that mask again.

For once I didn’t. “You um, have a nice home”. I looked around at all of the different furniture. It was mostly wooden with plush simple designs. I wanted to say more than just compliment her home. I didn’t know why but I just wanted to see her happy again. Just the thought of it made me giddy.

*What is this feeling?* I didn’t have time to think of an answer however as Hanna stood. “Well Tilraf, the sun will be setting soon, so we need to pop into town to grab some stuff for dinner. You should come with me.”

My mind went back to the big stone building. “Um, are you sure it’s a good idea” I asked. She nodded.

“Yep, besides the earlier the rest of the village sees you the better”.

With that she quickly led me to the front door. She opened it to reveal a still very wet, very cold front drive. My tail flicked in mild disgust. I didn’t want to get wet and cold again, especially after just warming up inside Hannas home.

Hanna seemed to pick up on my hesitancy because she quickly retrieved a large coat and woollen cloth from a peg. “Here, it was my father’s overcoat and scarf. She quickly helped me put on the coat. It was certainly made for a smaller body shape, but it wasn’t too small, coming down to my mid-thigh. Actually, it felt nice to wear something so warm and soft. Next came the so-called scarf. She wrapped it around my neck before tying it off in a knot. Again, it felt nice. The fabric was a bit itchy but that was a small price to pay for the warmth it now provided.

“Go on then, give me a spin,” said Hanna. Reluctantly I did as she asked turning fully to show of my new outfit from every angle. *If only my father could see me know. Twirling in front of another predator.*

“Oh yes Tilraf you look very cu- I MEAN um smart, yes smart.”

Her cheeks were turning bright red as I shot her a confused look. This only seemed to make her redden more. Without another word she ushered me outside and locked the door behind us. We quickly set of into the small village. However, we did not walk back down the road as I had presumed. Instead, we walked over a small field and through a clump of woods. After about 3 minutes of walking, we exited the woods right into the middle of the village. I could see the green from before right in front of me.

I looked hesitantly as the large stone building. *I hope Hanna keeps me far away from there.* Thankfully she led me in the other direction. There were few people near the row of shops but those that passed us shot me looks varying from fear to outright anger.

We stopped at a store labelled Butcher. Such a simple name could have never done justice to the pure paradise that was inside the store. As I followed Hanna inside, I was met with a surreal sight. The scent made my eyes water as my pupils dilated. Never before had I seen so much fresh meet in one place. This sort of luxury had even been above my noble lifestyle.

I took in the sight. Cooked meats were displayed behind a glass counter, along with battered items and pastries. Large carcasses hung from meet hooks on the back wall. I sniffled slightly as I tried to control my instincts. Alas it was futile. The scent, the sight my mind was overloading. My tail started to flick rapidly as drool escaped my mouth.

A large bellowing chuckle finally freed me from my trance. A man in large white overalls stood opposite me across the counter. He had a large meat cleaver in one hand. “Someone having a good time”. I tucked my snout into my overcoat in embarrassment. I had let my emotions show again. I cursed myself again for being so foolish, but this time it felt less important almost.

Nevertheless, I felt the mask fall into place again. I stood more upright as a scowl grew across my face.

Hanna smiled, “Barry this is Tilraf, he um shall we say decided life in the dominion was not to his liking anymore”. Barry crossed his arms, his smile disappeared but his eyes still shined bright with laughter.

“I don’t blame him for wanting to do that. Don’t worry, your secret is safe with me.” Hanna nodded in thanks.

“I appreciate that, Barry.”

“Anything for a fellow vet, now what can I do for you?”

Hanna took her time browsing the meat. She pointed to a large slab of meat with some bone sticking out one end. “One leg of lam please”. Barry nodded and took it out of the display before wrapping it up and placing it in a bag. 

Hanna turned to me. “Anything you want Tilraf”. *Oh by the hunter, she wants me to pick something.* I carefully stepped forward. I could feel the butcher’s eyes on me as I took in the different smells. Something stuck out to me, it was more gamey, wilder than the other meats. I sniffed again. Yes, this meat was different. My stomach rumbled as I scanned the counter. The smell was coming from several long cylindrical tubes of meat. I pointed at them.

“Can we have some of those”. Hanna shot me a look that I could not decipher.  

Barry nodded with a huff. “Venison sausages, good choice”. Hanna reached into her pocket for some money but Barry raised his hand. “On the house Hanna, welcome back”.

Hanna smiled. “Thanks Barry that means a lot, I’ll see ya later”. With that Hanna led me out of the store. As we walked back to the path, we passed a strange building. A sign hung on the wall above the entrance. It read “The Dukes Head”. *Why do humans find it necessary to use such weird names for things.*

The walk back was a bit longer than the way there, but I didn’t mind. The rain had eased off by now and I could barely feel the cold through my new garments. As soon as we entered Hanna turned on the stove to start cooking dinner.

I glanced at the grill in mix of disgust and anxiety. *I really don’t want more burnt meat. But would it be rude to say something? I don’t want to upset Hanna.*

Luckily, I didn’t need to ask as Hanna picked up on my mood. “You want your sausages raw?” I nodded eagerly. “Yes”.

“Alright then, let me put some food on for me, I think we should watch a movie tonight”.

*A movie?*

Sure enough just an hour later I was back in the sitting room. Now I sat next to Hanna on the sofa. My sausages along with a few chunks of spicy meat sat on my plate. Hanna had something she called bangers and mash. Said dish seemed to be the sausages from earlier (Now burnt like all human meat). Alongside it was a clump of a lumpy white potato and some beans in a red sauce.

Whilst the smell was certainly a bit unpleasant, I decided that I could tolerate it.  The wood burner was crackling and popping bringing not only a nice warmth but also a peaceful atmosphere to the room. I took a bite out of my sausage as Hanna selected a movie. It tasted amazing, not chewy, and full of fear chemicals like the sentient meat I had back on Wriss. I shuddered at the thought of eating such a meat again. I had never liked eating sentient meat but when it was the only option I didn’t really have much choice. 

I glanced up at the screen. A tall human male was smiling widely at female human. They seemed to be in some kind of restaurant. The females face went red as the male told a funny joke. A thought came to my mind.

“Hanna, why did the females face go red?”

Hanna choked on her food. “COUGH…..um well when a human is embarrassed or feels love their cheeks tend to go red. It’s a biological reaction, its called blushing.” My mind went back to earlier today when Hanna had blushed before we left the house.

*Was she embarrassed or…did she like me?* I thought about my own feelings *Do I like her?* There it was again, that fuzziness, like I was melting from the inside. Hanna interrupted my silent thought.

“Do people fall in love back on Wriss?”. That question made me think for a second. *Now that I think about it, I never saw anyone in love. It wasn’t exactly banned, but it was certainly frowned upon.*

“It did happen but it is rare. I suppose that no one had time for such things, or that they couldn’t tolerate someone else company for so long.”

Hanna seemed to be in thought for a second. “Do you like being in people’s company?”.

I thought back to my earlier life. *I suppose I hadn’t been as averse to social interaction as some others in my family, I guess I was to worried about hiding my empathy to think about it to much.*

“I don’t know, I guess I um don’t mind”. Hanna didn’t respond to that but looking down at her I could see that she was blushing slightly. I was getting nervous now emotions were swirling around in my head as my defective side took control. Love, fear, anxiety, anger. They were mixing together in an angry cocktail of conflicting feelings and thoughts.

I looked back at the screen. The male human was sitting next to the woman at a cinema. I watched as he put his hand round her shoulder. The woman leaned against him in a show of subtle but powerful love.

I glanced over at Hanna, she was fixed on the screen, I could see her hands clasped together tightly as her face turned a darker shade of red. *Should I do the same?* I asked myself. ***No, its wrong love is for the weak.*** Responded another part of me. I shook my head slightly. There it was again that nagging part of my brain that kept reminding me of my defectiveness. Of how weak I was. Of how disgraceful I was.

No. I was done listing to that side of me. *Fuck Betterment, fuck my fucking noble blood. I’m done I am not dealing with that shit any fucking more. They don’t own me. I make my own future now.*

With that I slowly put my arm around Hannas’s shoulder. She flinched slightly but didn’t pull away as I had feared. Instead, she leaned into me. I sucked in a deep breath, partly out of relief and partly due to the nerves.

She hummed slightly, “So Tilraf, do you like me?”. My heart skipped a beat. This was so new to me. I was so used to having my guard up all the time. I felt vulnerable, something I had always tried to avoid. *Maybe just this one time…*  “I think I do”.

“I do to” whispered Hanna as she rested her head on my chest. Her heartbeat matched mine as we continued to watch the movie.

Soon enough, the credits began to roll. I hadn’t been paying much attention, much to focused on myself and my emotions. I felt exhausted. Looking down I found Hanna had drifted of to sleep. “Hey, Hanna” I called softly. She didn’t stir.

I sighed. *Maybe we can stay like this….. just a bit longer.* I felt myself begin to drift off as I thought about what tomorrow might bring.

1h7nn9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h7nn9c/aita_for_hating_my_daughter_and_exwife/,AITA for hating my daughter and ex-wife?,"I (57F) have been married to my now-wife Lorraine (53F) for around ten years years now. I have a daughter from my previous marriage, Emily (28F). Ever since me and Lorraine's wedding, she had cut all ties with me and went to a college which is on the other side of the country from where I live, and currently lives there now.

  
Growing up, me and my ex-wife (Sharon, now 54F) had a difficult relationship after Emily was born. We married young, very. We had Emily two years later. Sharon suffered from post-partum depression, withdrawing herself from me and she had extreme crying spells and anxiety attacks, constant hitting and screaming from her side, something I hadn't seen in her before. It terrified me. I was stuck with a newborn daughter that, in turn, had turned my wife into a maniacal monster, unsure if to love her.

  
When Emily was four, Sharon was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety. Her mood swings from post-partum, the nightmare I knew, became more and more nightmarish. Sometimes, there was coolness between the flames, but occasionally. At this point in my life I still loved my wife. 

After three months of this diagnosis, I got a new job as a IT supervisor at a local office company that supplied paper, which has now since closed down. I met Lorraine, the daughter of the owner of the company. Lorraine was initially very nice to me, bringing me coffee everyday to my desk and having light-hearted conversations with me. We became very good friends. She was there for my daughter's fifth birthday, my second daughter's baby shower, and my younger brother's wedding. I had lost my best friend in high  school and later university in a drunk-driving accident, and Lorraine became his replacement, in a way. 

  
But things escalated. Quickly. Sharon was at home most of the time in our co-rented apartment, but whenever she wasn't, I would always invite Lorraine over for a quick coffee or chitchat. For context, me and Sharon, after the wedding, had moved to a new state where I virtually had no friends or family. 

  
But one night, me and Sharon had got into a bad argument about the bills and rent, which led to her screaming and thrashing herself to the ground. As she did, I sighed and locked her into our apartment, leaving to go get a smoke outside.

  
Outside the cool wind of our apartment complex I took a cigarette and smoked. I found Lorraine walking up to me. She told me something I still, in a way, love her for. She told me she'd been following me for a few months. Seeing the places I had lunch. Seeing where I would go out with my wife for dinner on the rare occasions we were happy. Seeing me at work, humming to rock music while doing my daily reports. 

  
And she kissed me. That felt so good. I kissed back too. 

  
I found myself carrying her to my apartment room to do the deed when I remembered my wife was still in there. I found no noise coming from her. ""Must've gotten herself asleep,"" I thought. In fact, why not? 

  
I unlocked the door and went inside our bedroom, even though Sharon was on the living room floor, breathing and tired from thrashing, taking a nap. You might understand what happened next.

  
This is how I lived for the next couple of decades. Everyday I would wait for Sharon to leave so me and Lorraine would have alone time of some sort. I didn't care, strangely, if Sharon found out. I never felt anything for her

  
Emily became aware of my emotional affair when she turned 15, and yelled at me for it. She had always taken care of her mom after her outbursts and such and hated how often I was out of the house, either work or Lorraine's place. I screamed at her then too, telling her that I hadn't found anyone as passionate as Lorraine was. My daughter told me that Sharon was in a bad place in her life, and would never do the same. I told her that it didn't matter.

  
So now me and Lorraine have been married for ten years after we both sent Sharon to a psychiatric ward twenty miles off the west coastline. We have no children, as she is infertile. Emily had begged us to not send her mother to the psych ward, but I told her it was for the best. It had gotten to a point in Sharon's life where she had developed hysteria and more horrible outbursts over the smallest things. 

After Emily was accepted to Yale, she packed her bags and left, blocking me on everything. I have no idea where she is now. And I hate her, still. Her mother was not a good person, can she not understand that?

I think its fine, but my husband thinks it's too beige/bland. I've tried incorporating color in the past but it's never really worked. 

A couple of things to note:
- we have young kids so we decided not to have a coffee table so there's more space for play. We have a memory foam beanbag instead.
- we have no curtains as I don't think there's enough space on either side of the main window to accommodate the fabric. We have decent privacy so not really a huge issue
- the room is around 25 square meters (270 square feet I believe?)
- we don't really want any more furniture in this space given point 1 above so it's probably more a question of how I can improve how it all looks with replacing pieces as opposed to adding without taking away

Thanks!

Part of what she's doing is gathering wool from sheep for various in game projects she has on the go.  For a cheap laugh, I suggest she tries to shear a chicken for it's feathers.  We are already well  aware it won't work, but she tries, for my sake.

This got me thinking, not only would you not have to kill a chicken for it's feathers if you could use the shears on them, it would be hilarious to see your chickens running around, naked, until they eat.

1h7nb9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h7nb9h/i_hate_that_my_family_only_comforted_my_sister/,I hate that my family only comforted my sister when my grandpa died,"I (24 F) have always been super close with my grandpa. he’s like a father figure to me and I always accidentally called him dad which he never minded. I would take care of him anytime my family and him would go on vacations for special occasions like weddings. During those time frames, no one would take care of him and it was on me which I didn’t mind because I loved my grandpa. He was wheelchair bound. 

I didn’t mind taking care of him when I came home from college either. It was my turn to take care of him after he took care of me when I was a kid. He’s honestly one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life. my family on the other hand is more complicated story I have very estranged relationship with them. I started working during the summers and full-time just so I wouldn’t have to go home for a long period of time. And since I graduated, I hardly ever go home however I do visit for the holidays. 

Due to a lot of circumstances with my family which I have written stories about it I try to avoid them. but I’ll give a quick summary. My parents enable my sister behavior since I was a kid, blaming it on her mental illness, and that she needs more help than me. any of her bad behaviors was always enabled by them. They always gave her money and she’s quite abusive to most people around her. She beat me as a kid, stole for me stabbed me, touched me and even tried to get one of her 18-year-old friends to rape me when I was 12. But my sister was never reprimanded for any of these instead I was blamed for somehow antagonizing her to act out in that way. 

I had to beg for help from my parents. If I needed extra help, even though I’m younger and barely out of college, they’ll tell me I have money and I need to figure it out. But legitimately my dad gave my sister $20 for grabbing his coffee out of the car. If I asked for $20, I’d have to find someway to earn it from him.

Needless to say, I don’t have the best relationship with my sister, but my parents tell me I’m being a bad sister and I need to support her and to be a better Christian . Thats the dynamic of being home. Since I was a kid, I always sacrificed my happiness and my mental health for the good of the family. As much as I love seeing my grandpa, I couldn’t be around my family. so I called him multiple times every single week to catch up with him. 

However, he had a procedure done and got infection and unfortunately got sepsis and passed away . it was on Thanksgiving day I had driven in to state the before and I went to see him at the nursing home and it was a hard site to see. I knew he was struggling since he hadn’t been answering my calls, but when I got there, he couldn’t talk. His eyes were just rolled to the back of the head and he would occasionally cry out in pain. When he wasn’t answering his phone, I would call my parents or my sister to get updates and they never keep me in the loop. 

It was hard for me to see and I know it was probably hard for everyone to see. The following day on Thanksgiving day my mom went over to the nursing home after her turkey trot to spend some time with him and I never got an update. Meanwhile I was up since 830 cooking everything for Thanksgiving and I mean everything. I was making the mac & cheese and shredding the cheese and I grated my finger on the cheese grater and it hurt and my finger was gushing blood and my dad just made fun of me. 

I asked my dad for help and he said he would but he would go and take a nap or go to work on some thing and he just never did help . I asked Dad to help with taking the  roasted pecans out of the oven while I was getting ready to go see my grandpa. I told him to take them out within five minutes and 20 minutes go by and I check the oven and they’re all burned and my dad was just laughing and watching plain trains and automobiles and just turns to me and tells me I should probably take those out.

I was annoyed so I called my mom and she said “yeah if you want, you can come over to say goodbye to Grandpa” . And his nursing home is really close to my house so I just ran to the nursing home. I barely made it before my grandpas last breath. Thankfully, I was able to hold his hand, kiss his forehead, and tell him who it was and telling him that I  wanted to say goodbye again. Not even a minute later he dies. It was so hard for me, but no one comforted me.

And then I got mad at my mom because I found out that she called and texted my sister to let her know that she should come by and say goodbye . I never got any messages like that. I had to call her to find out. my sister finally came after my grandpa died even knowing that he was going to die really soon. She’s always known to be late for things. She was crying because that was her grandpa too. So I understand why she was upset, but I was just mad at her that she got an update about an important event and was still late.

It Annoyed me so much because my uncle and  my mom were my sister telling her she’s God’s gift she’s an angel she’s perfect. My grandpa loved her the most.  And she was wearing all my clothes. My mom had cleared out my closet when I was gone and gave all my clothes to my sister, even though I told her not to. I was just so hurt that nobody comforted me.

Yes, my sister took care of Grandpa for the last year, but she got paid to do it . She got paid $30 an hour just to sit in the room with him. I would do that with him and I would run errands grocery shop change diapers help into the bathroom bathe him make sure he gets his meds. not a single thank you because to me this is my grandpa. But when my sister started taking care of him, my mom would post about it on the family group chat, and everyone would appraise her and view her like a saint 

I feel like my mom was trying to change your image in the family because she did not have the best image due to her actions in the family . But it hurt to see her get that recognition, I’ve always wanted not necessarily just about my grandpa but in general. 

My sister said goodbye to him and left but I stayed back until they put my grandpa in a body bag . I wanted to make sure that he got there safely. I returned home and all my family were there and I went to my room and cried. I wanted a moment to just process everything. It hadn’t even been two minutes when my dad knocks on the door and was telling me to come outside. I told him I just needed a minute and he said no come out with the family. We were taking a shot.

For background, my family always takes a shot after someone passes as a celebratory of life kind of thing . But I don’t drink and I really just needed a moment. The whole weekend I didn’t get a single moment to myself to even process everything. I know my family greased by partying and spending time with each other, but everyone grieves differently and they did not respect that. I wanted some space. There’s other things that happened that weekend that my parents/sister did that really annoyed me and inconvenienced me.

I’ll just talk about one of the things that annoyed me . My Grandpa ‘s funeral is gonna be the next weekend which is this weekend now. And my dad was scheduling everyone’s flights and I finally got a one way flight. Which is huge for me because normally there’s never any one ways to where I’m going, and I always have to take some kind of connecting flight. However, without even asking me, my dad tried to cancel my plane ticket and give me a two-way.

The reasoning ? My sister’s boyfriend, technically not even her boyfriend they have this weird on and off relationship was coming to the funeral. And he’s never flown alone before. Keep in mind this man is like 28. They wanted me to take a connecting flight to their state before flying back to my state just so I can escort him to and from the airport. Which is a huge inconvenience for me. It would cause me to get home much later than anticipated on Sunday. So on Sundays, I really need enough time to get organized and get things set up since where I work it’s an hour away and I only get a 20 minute lunch so I need to meal prep prep on Sundays and I just have a lot to do on Sunday. The flight would allow me to at least have a decent amount of time to get all that done. A two-way flight would not.

My sister couldn’t fly back with him because my mom and her are going on a vacation together . My family often goes on vacations together and leaves me behind. Apparently, my sister had a meltdown and demanded that I fly with her BF to make things easier on him. I got to an argument with my dad saying that he didn’t even ask me and he said well that’s why we’re talking about it now but it’s not really talking about if he’s making the decision for me.

I had to argue 30 min to get a compromise. Which is now that I have to go to the airport at 5 AM escort him through TSA and I can’t use my per-check because he doesn’t have it and the airport we’re going to is really crowded so that’s gonna take a while to get through. Then I need to take him to his gate, chill with him at his gate for 2 hours and make sure he gets on the plane. Then find my gate and wait another 2-3 hours.

So I would be at the airport for roughly 5 hours before my flight . When it was my first time flying alone, no one gave a shit and told me to toughen enough and to figure it out. I also found out that my dad use my flight miles to buy her boyfriends ticket even though I’ve been saving them up. 

No, he did not ask again . it was just kind of expected of me to push back what I need to do to help out her boyfriend or anyone in the family for the Good of the family. This week has just been extremely hard. I didn’t even call out of work since I knew they needed me,  I work as a Paraprofessional Aid . And one of the kids this week was not taking his meds so he was pretty difficult with me this week. 

I’m just been going through the motions and trying to get through the week . I just miss my grandpa so much. Him and I were thick as thieves. Even though I didn’t come home as of often this last year, I still made a lot of time for him and to check up on him. It hurt me so much that my family never gave me any acknowledgment for my pain, but practically coddled my sister. She hasn’t worked in over 3 years and my parents pay for her house and any other expenses on top of her payment for her to be with my grandpa. I know for a fact, if money was not involved, she would not spend nearly as much time as she did with him. I’m just so tired of the favoritism I never being appreciated for the things I do for the family. 

I’ve always done what I was told always sacrificed what I wanted for the good of the family. I even went to the college. My parents wanted in the degree they wanted and graduated on the Dean’s list. But my mom told me that they lowered the bar for me so much and I still can’t reach it. Despite my sister dropping out college three times. It’s like they don’t even see me or my accomplishments. The only one  who did was my grandpa and now he’s gone. It feels weird, but I just have this feeling like I have no family left. And before anyone asked, I am in therapy. I just really wanted to get this out of my system, so thank you for anyone who stayed till the end.",1,1733441827.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

Despite how awful it's been this year a few prior, we're iffy on home schooling for a number of reasons.

I guess i'll be blunt: I was wondering if there were any home-school parents on this sub that I could have an IRL discussion with.  A phone call would be fine.  A visit to a coffee shop, brewery, restaurant would be great, too.  It's just too big of a subject to tackle through online comments, though resources would be nice.

1h7n8wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1h7n8wt/what_do_i_do_now/,What do i do now,"Hello,

I (18F) am diagnosed with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I also have CPTSD, depression and anxiety. I have been experiencing new and worsening symptoms that i really dont think are just them. Even if they are, i am struggling so much with my quality of life at this point. 

My biggest symptoms that are affecting me the most:

-muscle weakness; its so bad i struggle to wash my hair or walk up stairs. I dont think its just joint pain from my EDS.
-dizziness even when laying down. Im used to some dizziness when i stand. I cant sleep now because im so dizzy when im even laying down.
-low grade fever almost every day; i dont always have a thermometer, but when i have the feeling of being feverish and i am able to access a thermometer, its always around 100.5°F to 101.0°F.
-extreme brain fog; i cant think, my friends and family say im absent and confused, its getting harder and harder to remember words and i often trip over my words; my friends say my speech is slower as well.
-hair loss; its not just my scalp hair, im losing eyelashes and eyebrow hairs. No bald spots, just a lot thinner.
-extreme fatigue. Im so tired. I sleep so much and its never enough. I try and stay awake but i end up falling asleep even when trying to do something. Im too tired to go out and do things.
-odd rashes. They appear on my hands, arms, and my legs. They are small bumps, sometimes filled with fluid, and they are very itchy. Lotion doesnt help.
-loss of appetite. I get so hungry, have food cravings. I get food in front of me, and my appetite is gone. Its like it evaporates. I try to eat some anyway, but i just end up nauseous. My throat always feels like its full too, even when not eating.
-warning: stool discussion. I am having odd stools, covered in mucus or something? I have to go multiple times a day, not diarrhea but just sudden and intense urges. Sometimes nothing even comes out.
-light sensitivity. Kinda self explanatory. I cant walk with my head up cause my eyes hurt too much, and then i get a headache. I never used to get headaches, but now i have one every day usually on just one side of my head.

I have seen a gastroenterologist. I did a combo endoscopy/colonoscopy in September i think. I have been diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome since i was younger because i get bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting. In April of this year, i had a really bad one. I spent a week unable to keep anything down. I went to the hospital a few times because i was dehydrated and i started vomiting coffee grounds. I couldnt even keep nausea medicine down, and they gave me a suppository... That thing didnt help but did take away some of my dignity lol. Eventually i started feeling better like i always seem to.

I have seen a rheumatologist, as my ANA was positive and had a speckled pattern with a titer of 1:640. They dont think it is autoimmune. Here are my other tests with results marked as abnormal:
-Centromere AB test was high at 155u/mL. Ruled out because i dont have the symptoms of scleroderma.
-Alkaline Phosphatase was 91 units/L. The system said that the normal range was 0-80, so its not that much higher.
-Creatinine was 0.86mg/dL. The system said that the normal range was 0.50-0.80, so again not that much higher.
-C Reactive Protein was at 15.7 mg/L. The system says the normal range is 0.0-10.0.
-Sedimentation rate was 27 mm/hr. System says range is between 0-20. In the summer it was also ""high"", which is part of why i was referred to rheumatology in the first place.
-blood in urine. Most of my urine tests have come back with blood, but i do not menstrate. I think something like 6/8 of the ones ive bad in the past couple years have had blood.

All tests, besides the centromere one, for rheumatological diseases came back negative/within normal ranges. 

This was my second appointment with my rheumatologist. He did the tests, i will attach the actual pictures of the results in the comments, during my first appointment. This one he said that there was nothing that showed something autoimmune. I started crying because i dont know what to do now. He said something about mayo clinic, but we are too far and we dont have lots of money. I had asked if he could help me get a handicap pass, but once i started crying he wouldnt say much, just that theres nothing he can do, and he left. My mom left a few minutes later to ask if our appointment was done because he left so abruptly. A nurse came in and said we were done. I dont know what to do now because i thought he could at least give us a pointer as to where to go next.

My mom says it might be psychosomatic, as i have a history of being abused by my father and i am diagnosed with CPTSD. I dont think it is psychosomatic, but at this point i dont care what it is. I just want to get help. I cant keep this up, every day feels worse. Im nearly at the end of my first semester of college, but im so scared im not gonna get to finish because of how fast my body is failing me. I was finally feeling better mentally, but now my body is falling apart and i dont know what to do now.

A few months ago he lost his job at a writing agency due to a crippling case of writer's block, something I'm sure we can all relate to. Not always losing a job to it but still crippling writer's block. He's worked at here and there jobs, some questionable jobs to. For a week he did fanfiction commissions and was traumatized. But anyways after losing his job he couldn't afford the apartment he was living in and resorted to craiglist to find a new apartment. He finds himself living with ""somebody's mom"" who's actual name is Janice and the reason he calls her somebody's mom is because she treats him as if he's her child and Frederick is kinda torn between if he likes it or not because he isn't very close with his parents and isn't used to parental affection. Janice somehow using her somebody's mom magic tells another writing company about Fredrick and gets him a phone call, which leads to an interview, and then a job. Now Fredrick finds himself intrigued by the receptionist Neil when he goes in for the interview. He gets sweaty and distracted. Neil finds himself also intrigued by Frederick. He likes his rugged look and finds him cute.

Neil volunteers to keep an eye on Fredrick and help him get his work done after the company hired Frederick hoping to help him with his writer's block(there's more details this is just summarizing what I've got so far) Frederick eventually develops feelings for Neil but he has a slight case of internalized homophobia, not necessarily because it's against his beliefs but more because it's an ""unwanted distraction"". Neil has a very down low thing for Frederick and his butterflies develop a little after Fredrick's. Now Fredrick's boss is replaced by this new woman who is more focused on getting work done. She threatens if Fredrick can't get his book finished before (not currently known) deadline than he'll be fired. Neil tries extra hard to help Fredrick but Frederick is still finding himself constantly distracted this is where the wine scene happens which is going to be very cinematic and I'm working on a very good song for it. Fredrick will kiss Neil and then go back to his apartment hiding there until Monday. Neil comes up with a story idea while Fredrick gay panics all weekend. And on Monday morning still kinda awkward Fredrick finds that something is somehow resolved. Even if it's slightly Frederick feels a little bit of motivation. Neil meets up with Fredrick carrying a basket with muffins and a bottle of wine. Presenting not only the basket to Fredrick but his idea. Frederick loves the story idea and sparks fly in more ways then one. He feels weight lifted. He feels motivated. But he also feels in love. Love without a burden. He asks Neil out for coffee and Neil talks about what led him to being an alcoholic. Frederick comforts Neil about it. Fredrick will work on writing the book. Eventually end it and present it for publishing. In which he requests to not only put his name on the cover but also Neil's name on the cover. So yeah that's what I've got so far. More will happen.

Thanks in advance, and feel free to give recs for other favorite spots too! We're big coffee fans, and adore most asian foods, especially a good xiao long bao.",0,1733441169.0,denverfood,2,0.33,False

Yo, Bitcoin hit the high just last night,  
Hundred K candles, man, it was bright.  
We were poppin' bottles, flexin’ big dreams,  
Woke up this morning—price ripped at the seams.

Blink and you’ll miss it, that’s the crypto grind,  
Up to the moon, then it leaves you behind.  
To my ex who blocked me—yo, how does it feel?  
Bitcoin’s the boss now; yeah, the gains are real.

I told her, “Hodl, babe, trust the plan,”  
She said, “Crypto’s fake, I need a real man!”  
Now she’s scrolling through charts, jaw on the floor,  
Watching Bitcoin do what I said before.

Blink and you’ll miss it, that’s the crypto grind,  
Breaking through walls, then leaving you blind.  
We smashed through 100K—what a feat,  
But twenty-four hours later? Man, we faced defeat.

The markets move fast, they don’t play fair,  
One minute you’re flying, next, gasping for air.  
But CoffeeShopCrypto? Yo, they called the dip,  
Fair value gaps—they laid out the script.

You didn’t watch the vid? Bro, that’s your loss,  
Could’ve placed those buys and still been the boss.  
Now you’re sitting here, staring at the pain,  
While others pick up the profits again.

Blink and you’ll miss it, that’s the Bitcoin ride,  
One second, you’re king, next, swallowed by pride.  
This game’s for the bold, the patient, the wise,  
So keep one eye open—don’t trust all the highs.

Next time Bitcoin’s flying the skies,  
Remember to follow the pros for the prize.  
CoffeeShopCrypto had the blueprint in hand,  
But you missed the boat, couldn’t make a stand.

Fair value gaps? Yeah, they’re real, my dude,  
Play it right, and you’ll shift the mood.  
From broke to boss in the blink of an eye,  
That’s the Bitcoin bounce—are you ready to try?",0,1733440971.0,Bitcoin,0,0.5,False

Molly called her to come by to the Mcgee house as everyone they knew were hanging out together. Andrea tells Alina about her leaving to the McGee's and gives her a kiss on the cheek before leaving. That day Libby was also busy so the only people there were Molly, Ollie, Darryl and june alongside all the parents that day. They all wanted to have a day were all the adults do there own thing and the kids all have a good time as it was a weekend and they were all having fun. Andrea goes into Molly room to see her using the family computer as Molly tells her hello and exsplains what's going on that day. ""Hey Andrea isn't today so exsiding!"" Molly says excitedly ""I know it's crazy, so what are you doing?"" Andrea ask Molly. ""I getting ready to play Team Fortress 2 with Oille,Darryl,Alina,Libby and her girlfriend Jill"" Molly say in her normal tone ""Why isn't Jocab and his GF there?"" Andrea ask. ""They were busy today. I also ask Emmie if she wanted to play but she said she was busy exploring herself in the real world for some reason, same with June as well"" Molly says not knowing the reason why. ""I think I know what's going on... I heard you like magic, I got a wond and a rabbit for them 2, not you obviously I know how you feel about fake magic makes you feel, Molly."" Andrea say patting Molly's head. ""You go get em out there girl"" Molly says. With them all knowing about Andrea leaving she spends her time walking along the steers in town. June is juat sitting in a big empty unbuilt building thinking about some past experiences. Little did she know Emmie was spying on her. June juat sits as a realizes hit her ""You know I've never actually done any with a girl honestly, it's probably because I've never had a chance to. June says thinking no one is neer by she gabs her pair of earphones and starts listening to music. As Andrea ends up finding her just dancing around she see how happy she is with her arms out like a angel though the car sun roof."" Andrea says even though there isn't car around She doesn't wanta call if off. But she doesn't know to call it love yet as she realizes how beautiful she is but doesn't know what to even say to her about it. June is having the time of her life as she says something out loud ""I've could have been playing TF2 but I just wanted to be alone in a big building"" Emmie just sits there and chuckles on what she said ""I could have been a spy in TF2 but I wanted to spy in real life"" she says with a dumb smile at the end while being quiet. ""Meet the spy like its May, 19th, 2009, just hope I don't lose a head over it."" She whispers. They sit there for a few hours as the night time rolls in and as it does Emmie gets cold but luckily for her she brought a sweater, along side noght vision goggles and a flash light for getting around. ""I'm still here June and I'm H-O-T T-O G-O right now."" Andrea whispers in almost pitch black. Then in that moment June eyes open up as the sunset reflects on her as she feels upset to see someone as Andrea approaches her. ""Hey... June don't feel bad. Take a sad song and make it better."" Andrea says to her directly. 'What are you saying?"" June ask. ""It's a reference to a old song June, remember to let her in your heart, sorry I can't stop referencing it"" Andrea says while blushing. ""Aww"" June says while hold Andrea's hand while looking into each other. ""I'm glad to see while everyone else is playing TF2 and it's just un 2 together alone here. Andrea says with a cat face at the end (:3) not knowing about Emmie spying outside the building. ""Is there something you want to tell me Andrea"" June says wondering if she was thinking what she thinks she is thinking. ""Yeah"" Andrea screams ""I know that you already have Darryl but the truth is that... Andrea takes an pause as it feel harder for her to get words out of her mouth. Are you ok, Andrea? June says as she notices Andrea's face turn red as she has a gay panic but she gets the most important words out. ""IT'S JUST THAT I LOVE YOU SO MUCH"" Andrea says as she pull June in for a kiss on the lips. Both Andrea and June's face are both fully red as June is the first one to say something after that. ""Wow, that felt really good, didn't expect that today"" June says suprise as Emmie sits from far way from them in shock. ""Every good happens after midnight, darling"" Andrea says as grabs on to June and lays with her. ""I think I'm in love"" June says. ""I think we sould make some love together"" Andrea says feeling more confident then before. Emmie sat there and continued watch not know what would unfold and had a film camera on her for taking pictures of them to making out. After they where done she saw both of them go into a ghost portal and she knew something was up. Unfortunately she couldn't see Andrea's face so it was unclear to her who it was with June. Libby was at home as she noticed some stange movement of people on her Life 360 circle as they all had each other accounts together as she says that there has been some stange interference with June and alerted the McGee's with one message. ""Intruder alert, Intruder alert, Code red time in the McGee house."" ""CODE RED!"" Molly says while panicking ""What's code red, Molly?"" Darryl ask. ""It means that something stange happen to one of the people we know and there could be something scary outside."" Molly says trying not to just break down while talking. ""Let's close the doors and the windows as well then."" Ollie says before going to hug Molly. ""PROTECT THE HOUSE!"" Libby texts them. ""Libby says, We need to protect the house"" Darryl say. Sharon and Pete end up getting home while the door is locked and Sharon trys opening it but she can't get inside the house. ""A little help here."" She says to Pete as he has the keys. ""Alright, alright, I got it. Stand back, honey"" Pete says trying all the keys he has ""This key right here."" he says trying it but it doesn't work. ""Uhh This key right here. As he says as it doesn't work as well. ""Uhh This key right here? He says unsure as that one also doesn't work. ""Uhh maybe this one"" even the 4th key he tried didn't work. ""Hurry up pete, Let's go, let's go, let's go!"" Sharon says as a few seconds after that you can she Libby and her mom lech run up to the McGee's house with a heavy bookshelf named Sasha as both of them come closer they both say ""Incoming!"" They end up opening the door but Pete gets hit in the process but is perfectly fine ""Hey, it's still safe here."" Lech says. ""Alright then."" Libby says right before Emmie ends up being at the frond door just right behind them ""Ahem, ladies and gentlemen."" Emmie says while standing up proudly of her entry. ""I see the house is safe."" She say. ""Safe and sound!"" Molly says. ""Yeah, it is!"" Ollie says as him and Molly stand up the same time ""Tell me, did anyone happen sence June on the way here?"" Emmie says taking a pause to see if anyone says yes ""No? Then we still have a problem."" Emmie say being worried about June ""And some questions"" She adds to then end of her sentience. ""Ooh, stange problem. I've seen plenty of weird things. They're all just simple little things with some problem that most people don't know about like you. Molly takes a bit of a plause. ""No offense, Emmie."" She says at the end. ""If you manage to understand everything, I assure you, we will find this person that she was last with."" Emmie says ""What are you? President of there fan club?"" Molly says. ""No... That would be June"" Emmie say as she grabs a folder of pictures she took of June with Andrea's face not being sence in the images. Multiple images of the this person she can't see and June being intimate fly out of the folder and onto the coffee table in the McGee living room. All the McGee's are stuttered in shock as they all are heavily breathing seeing all the photos. ""I can't believe what happened."" Molly says. ""and now there here to f*ck us! So listen up, darryl, or p*rnography starring your girlfriend will be the second worst thing that happens to you today."" Emmie says while Oille and Molly grabs some of the pictures of June and are showing them to each other. ""G-gimme that!"" Darryl says while grabbing all the pictures form both of them. ""This person has already breached our friend group."" Emmie says. As in the ghost world Andrea and June are hanging out with Geoff and Jeff having tea as Emmie fears for them. ""You've seen what he's done to our family!"" Emmie say as Molly realizes something ""Is Andrea ok?"" Molly says in fear. Thats the worst part of it all, they could ve hinding anywhere form us."" Emmie says trying not to panic. They could be in this very room! ""They could hinding in the roof. They could in the basement! They could even be-"" Emmie says as she gets cut off by getting draged off into a portal by a green and purple ghost as all of them don't know what to do now. ""Woah, woah, woah!"" Libby says. ""I can't believe she got dragged into the ghost world"" Molly says. ""So... We still got problem."" Ollie says. ""Big problem..."" Darryl says. ""Alright, who's ready to go find who's doing this"" Molly says as a portal appeared behind them with Andrea in her ghost form comes out. ""Right behind you."" Andrea says scary the whole house as the Team Fortress 2 ending flourish music plays. As she says ""It's was me. The Pink Pony Club girl kisser who did all the acts and I will be taking all the phote back to my house. Andrea grabs all the photos from Darryl as she leaves out the front door real quickly and says one more thing ""You half to stop the world just to stop this feeling"" as Andrea says before leaving the McGee's house into the sky to her house. Molly sits there in shock. ""You girl just got nailed by another girl, Darryl."" Molly says. ""Yeah you bet she did"" Darryl sits there is suprise the whole time. Most of the house residents were asleep but Darryl was waiting for June's body and Spirit to come to the McGee's house with the door being open as June felt funny seein Darryl awake so late. ""Darryl, why are you up so late, are you med at me?"" June says holding back tears as she waits for a answer. ""I'm not mad at you June, I just wanted to be with you so we could chat together about last night. Darryl says making June feel better ""I'm surprised you're not mad at me"" June say having tears of joy. ""I don't care if you think Andrea is great honestly, because as long as you don't try replacing me with A different guy. I will always be important to you."" Darryl says while hugging June. ""It's just like heaven being here with you Darryl while being excited."" June says putting her red face into his sweater as Darryl feels glad to see her safe. ""I'm just glad you're here today."" Darryl says while bring her to his room. ""Are you ready to sleep with each other June."" He says. ""Is it sleeping or is it something else?"" June says ""How tried are you June?"" Darryl ask ""I got some I need to burn"" June says."" Then let's get started"" he says. As they both fall asleep and the whole town of brighten is laying in bed and this story is a finished now, the end.

My(28m) Gf(25F) doesn't think this is cheating

We started dating at the beginning of last year and were together for most of it. The last half of our relationship was exclusive, but there were issues and she often seemed distant and not very affectionate.
There were a few times when she admitted to flirting and talking to other people. Whenever I brought it up, she’d either change the subject or brush it off, saying it was just harmless fun. She also had hangouts with male friends alone, had at odd hours of the night and would delete the chats from her“friends"" and get lost for words when asked about them .She even admitted to emotionally cheating, both in person and through messages, saying she liked the attention and validation of the other men and stringing them along 
We had many conversations about it, and she promised it would stop, but eventually, she pulled away and broke up with me. She gave a different reason for the breakup, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that the other issues played a role.

Within the year she reached out, apologized for everything, and admitted that the “friends” weren’t as innocent as she made them out to be. We talked about getting back together and agreed on a committed, communicative relationship with just the two of us. Things seemed great, almost perfect and really grew as people together , and we discussed how we’d handle things better this time.
She had to work far out town for a few months and the commute was too hard to keep up with so we continued growing while she was gone via text and call, and when she came back , things were good for a few weeks and the most amazing and loving feeling ever and everything was great. She received a message from an old male friend out of nowhere from a person she claimed she didn't have any real communicating with and he randomly messaged her and asked her, and she planned to go with him for some tea and coffee . When I asked about who he was, she shut it down immediately and defensively told me she won't be argueing and said this is what is happening and refused to let me speak my feels because she didn't care about my feelings and it's a me problem,  She said she wasn’t asking for permission, got frustrated, and told me I was overreacting and controlling. She also made comments about how I should just trust her and shouldn’t question her actions. Mentioned she doesn't care what I do, It felt like things flipped back to the way they were before, where I didn’t matter and not actually loved
I really don’t want to be controlling, but after everything we’ve been through, I can’t help but feel uneasy. She insists it’s just a harmless meetup, but I’m worried that history is repeating itself. I don’t want to overthink or ruin what we’ve rebuilt, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off. 

How should I be reacting to this? 

 TL;DR:
Girlfriend is meeting an ""old friend"" at a local espresso shop, but something feels off. I can't shake the feeling something more might be going on. Am I Overreacting

1h7mv1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h7mv1b/36m_31f_reasonable_grab_of_iphone_out_of_gf_hand/,"36M, 31F - Reasonable Grab of Iphone Out of GF Hand - Care to Weigh In?","For context: I am  a very loving, kind, and safe human being for women around me. - I grew up in a strong household of women, and took care of my mother for years, we had a close bond. I was very close with my only sister, who I protected, loved, and cared for deeply.  I am very emotionally integrated as a man. I am a gentle person. -  Not touting myself, just honesty.

My girlfriend and I had a disagreement and towards the end she dismissively was scrolling through her phone and said: ""I'm not even listening to you"". - All I wanted to do was connect with her and drop in, with some eye contact and hold hands and work through it. It wasn't some heated fight, just working through some stuff. Nothing intense or agressive.

I simply grabbed the phone from her hand, *non-agressively*, not like a snatch or any remote amount of force. It was reasonable, I know the difference. I have never remotely been anything akin to aggressive with a woman in my entire life. -- I put it on the coffee table right in front of us. I said: ""Hey can you please just be present with me and not on your phone?"", I just want to connect.

Surely I should have just verbalized this, and I agree with that.

She is relentlessly defensive about this one, almost to the point of painting me as unsafe. -She said this was me ""using my hands"" to make a point and I am somehow now potentially to be abusive? She has been harboring it as if I almost did something super agressive and she's really worked up about it, almost as if she said it was ""unsafe"" to do.

We are very close and in love, for reference. Not strangers.

On one hand, I see her point, but at the same time it's kind of spooking me a bit

Obviously I can honor her feelings/needs. It was a boundary for her and she didn't like it. So I have been apologizing and trying to make it right. I can respect that for her, it mattered to her, and I can be aware of not rationalizing my behavior if it mattered to her. Also, it's her physical property and technically I should not have done it.

But I'm a bit freaked out because she has spun off into logic like: ""what if you take my purse or car keys away from me"" or ""what if you ever did something worse"" - And this is never even remotely something I would consider in MY LIFE. She is treating it as if it's borderline something she can't ""get over"".

But does simply grabbing a phone, in a non agresive way out of someones hand and gently placing it on the coffee table and asking someone to be present: constitute like agression and abuse?",1,1733440575.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1h7mtwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1h7mtwc/paris_work_trips/,Paris Work Trips,"My wife has to often travel to Paris for work, and it’s okay among us that she can have a boyfriend there.

This started out as a fetish but evolved into the norm quickly, and mostly because she never says much about what happens and nor does she take any calls while there. It’s very much her time to destress from her high demanding work and responsibilities.

But recently, we put our kid to a French school here and she ran into a woman she knew. This woman also happens to be a lover of her boyfriend in Paris.

They talk often when we run into each other. Her husband doesn’t know anything about her affair.

My wife doesn’t think it’s all that concerning that she talks to her, that we end up interacting with them as much, or that her husband doesn’t know about anything.

This drove me nuts and I had to find out more about our her boyfriend, who I ignored knowing anything about until now. He’s Franco-African, has teenage kids, divorced, and is currently not only dating my wife, this other woman we know, but also another woman in Paris that is more stable and who he’s having a baby with soon. All three of them know of each other.

Worse, my wife has a business trip coming up, and when I was dropping off I had to make conversation with the other woman and this news slipped. So now she asked me if I can pick up something to give my wife to take to their “friend.”

In the moment, I said yes. I really hated the idea, but I was too much of a pushover.

So I took the gift from her at the next drop off, and she thanked me. And she asked how long my wife was going to stay there, and I said the week. And she was like wow, solo parenting the whole week and weekend? I said yes.

I asked if she has a business trip coming up, and she said she’s probably planing a workshop. 

Back home, I give the gift to my wife and she looks at it to guess what it could be and then puts it in her luggage. I also mention to her that she’d mentioned about the workshop.

And my wife says, yeah she wants to be there to help with the baby the first few weeks.

I was surprised that was a fake workshop, but my wife said no, that she’ll work, but the other girl is young and she’d love any help.

I asked if she’s helping in any and how involved she was with their situation and pregnancy.

At this point, my wife sensed I was angsty about all this.

“Well, if he asks me to be a wet nurse, I’d be happy to help,” she joked.

I didn’t find it funny.

My wife continued to pack: stockings, panties, mini-skirts, loose blouses, high heels, and then she paused and looked at me more seriously, “I work hard all year, when I’m in Paris it’s my time to play. This is our thing. Now, is there anything else? I’ll have my phone off after.”

“No.”

Okay, she sighed and walked into the bathroom. She didn’t close the door, so I sat on the bed and looked and her get undressed, lather herself with some lotion, and began shaving her body clean. She didn’t notice me watching. After her legs, she shaved her crotch. After, she went into the shover.

When she was done, she walked out of the shower and said, “What do you think her gift is?”

I shrugged, it was the least of my worries then.

On whim, while still in her towel, she took out the gift and opened it. It was a box with a note: “Manu, I’ve kept my husband from my pussy since the last time we were together. A year and a half that I’ve not let him enter me in any way. I am yours alone now.”

Inside the box, there were Polaroids of her in some incredibly horny posses and her soiled panty. I couldn’t believe I was seeing this naked mother of two in incredibly compromising and slutty manner.

“She’s must have a real itch,” my wife commented. She put it all back in and closed the box. “I’ll have to package it back up.”

I made a slight comment as she was looking for the gift wrapping paper up in the closet, “We haven’t had real intercourse in quite some time either…”

My wife didn’t hear or just ignored it.

She left early morning and her phone was shutdown of all communications.

The next day, at the drop off, I ran into the woman again. I have the images of her naked self in mind, but I told her my wife took the gift with her.

She thanked me for it.

I didn’t have the guts to ask her in person but I texted her a question I’ve been meaning to ask: do you think this situation is weird? Should we stop talking, I must seem really odd for lack of better words.

“Huh? No, it’s great I ran into you guys. I hope my marriage can be more like yours, it’s so inspiring to see a man who understands a woman’s needs like you. I hope my husband can evolve to this.”

I didn’t know what to reply to that, so I said, “oh okay, I hope it works out too.”

“I hope so, I remember your wife said your ED has been a blessing, it’s made it much easier.”

I was shocked!

I FaceTimed my wife, even though I knew I shouldn’t. It rang. I knew it was against our agreement. I called a few more times.

Then, the phone picked up. It was some random girl, it was a party, there was lots of noise, and she couldn’t even understand my English.

But she ended up pointing the phone towards my wife in the distance. She was sitting by the window in high heels, stockings, miniskirt, with her blouse unbuttoned quite deep with no bra on, her lips were red, and she was smoking. She was in the arms of her lover, leaning into him.

I hung up.

I only kept thinking about it the whole day, I never knew she smoked cigarettes. I couldn’t sleep, but I get a call from my wife.

I pick it up after a few ring. It was her at someone’s kitchen. She was in a t-shirt, no pants, making eggs. Her hair was messy.

Once she saw I had picked up, she looked my way and said, “I heard the story about your text message and I see you called me yesterday. What is happening with you.”

She reached up for some salt, her T-shirt rose up, and I saw she wasn’t even wearing panties on.

“Am I allowed to have sex with you?” I asked her, without a hi.

“We have sex.”

“It’s mostly me licking you.”

“You love it, I love it, what’s the issue?”

“You don’t even give me a blowjob.”

“I told you from when we dated, I won’t do that.”

“Will we ever have intercourse sex!”

Before she could answer, a really pregnant, younger girl walks in. She smiles at my wife and says something in French. My wife and her exchange kisses on the cheeks and she helps plate the table and sits down. My wife now serves eggs to the three plates and then starts making coffee.

The girl sees that I am on the phone and she asks something in French. “That’s my husband, he’s a little annoyed today.”

The girl giggles and says hi to me. I say hi out of habit.

In a broken English she says my wife has amazing maternal instincts and says she’s happy she’s there to help.

“Oh, but he has better maternal instincts, a better cook, a better housekeeper, better everything,” my wife teases me. “This would be a real French omelette instead of scrambled eggs right now if he were here, but boys don’t really appreciate these things in themselves”

“Les hommes!” The girl says. They speak some more in French and then the girl laughs. 

I then hear a man’s voice. My wife is quick to come near the phone and says I’m putting you on mute and off camera. 

A tall dark man walks in with just his boxers on. He kisses the young girl first, and then he goes and slaps my wife’s ass cheeks and gives her a kiss on the back of her head. She turns around with coffee in hand for him and then she rises on her toes to reach up for a kiss.

I don’t know what to do so I keep watching. 

They’re at a tiny Paris apartment with a small table. The young girl has a seat and the man too, but my wife is sitting in his lap while she gets fed time to time by him but she sticks mostly to coffee. His hands are freely feeling her bare legs, her ass cheeks are on his thighs, saddled, and I know her bare crotch lips are touching his thighs.

I don’t know if my wife even remembered I was still on or not.

The pregnant girl gets up she takes the plates and cups of her and my wife. She feels something in her stomach and spills the leftover coffee on my wife! The girl quickly puts the stuff in the sink and tried to clean up my wife’s t-shirt but she just wets it more. In the end, she takes it off her. My wife is now fully naked among the three. The girls squeezes out the coffee as much in the sink and leaves with it.

My wife, still fully nude, continues to clean up the table and then starts to do the dishes.

The pregnant woman comes back and sits on the man’s lap and feeds him as she eats of his plate as well some more.

In the back my wife finishes the dishes.

When she’s done, she goes to feel the pregnant woman’s belly, the women a smiling and caressing each other lightly. But the man’s hands freely moves between my wives thighs and to her crotch.

He gets up and yanks my wife by the hair and she doesn’t fight him but bends to his hands. As he holds my wife by the hair, he kisses the young girl gently, and then I watch him walk away with my wife leashed by the hair.

The pregnant girl comes towards the phone, picks it up, and she attempts to say in broken English how she’d love to meet me one day when I come over to Paris.",1,1733440484.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Hopefully you guys are all doing great and getting ready for the holidays.

Apologies in advance if this post has been posted too many times on here. 

My ask is simple: I am in the industry, 5 years of experience. Now thinking of pivoting into consulting. Can those who successfully made that switch share what worked for you? 

My background in details to provide more context:

Located in Toronto, have an MBA under my belt, 5 years of supply chain management experience (focus on manufacturing + planning, Mostly in CPG, went through automobiles, beverages, confectionery, electronics), very analytical. Currently on a lead role. 

Understand that the market is down and hiring freeze is probably the reality in the major big firms, I am a bit lost in terms of where I can start my journey. I have been doing some networking with old MBA classmates who are at the big 4 locally. If you have any tips or suggestions, I am all ears. 

Thank you everyone! Happy holidays. Also if you are here in Toronto and love networking, I am also happy to buy you a coffee for a chat. :)

1h7mr9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1h7mr9h/welcoming_the_stranger_a_journey_of_justice_and/,Welcoming the Stranger: A Journey of Justice and Compassion in God’s Word,"https://bgodinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1733439693.png

### Devotional: Welcoming the Stranger – A Journey of Justice and Compassion in God’s Word

**Scripture Reading:** Leviticus 19:34 (NIV) – “The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.”

- - - - - -

**Reflection:**

As we journey through life, we often encounter those who are different from ourselves—culturally, economically, or socially. In many societies, the “stranger” can represent a multitude of experiences: refugees seeking safety, immigrants carving out new lives, or even those simply feeling isolated within our communities. In the eyes of God, welcoming these individuals is not merely an act of charity; it is a divine command, rooted in justice and compassion.

The Bible gives us countless reminders to embrace the stranger, urging us to embody God’s love in welcoming all people. In Leviticus 19:34, we see a beautiful command that highlights our shared humanity. God calls us to remember our own stories—how we, too, may have felt like outsiders at one point. This experience should fuel our empathy and active engagement with those who may feel marginalized.

- - - - - -

**Educational Insight:**

In ancient Israel, the law mandated that strangers (or foreigners) be treated with dignity and respect. The rationale behind this was a foundational element of Jewish identity: the people of Israel were once slaves in Egypt, experiencing oppression and exclusion. Thus, the moral imperative to care for the stranger stems from a memory of suffering and liberation. This principle is echoed throughout Scripture, including in the teachings of Jesus, who constantly reached out to the marginalized.

Yet, in contemporary society, welcoming the stranger can be met with resistance. Fear often clouds our judgment; the unknown can instigate mistrust. However, scripture consistently reassures us that every person is created in the image of God, deserving honor and compassion.

Consider this: How can we foster environments where everyone feels heard, included, and valued? It begins with understanding that our mission is to act as hands and feet of Christ in the world. Acts of kindness can break down barriers—be it through hospitality, advocacy, or simply engaging in meaningful conversations with those of different backgrounds.

- - - - - -

**Encouragement:**

As you reflect on your own life, consider the strangers you encounter in your daily activities. Perhaps it’s a new coworker, a neighbor, or someone in your community from a different culture. How can you extend an invitation of grace?

1. **Practice Hospitality:** Invite someone to your home for a meal or coffee—to learn about their story, their culture, and their experiences.
2. **Get Involved:** Explore local organizations that support immigrants, refugees, or marginalized groups. Volunteer your time, resources, or skills.
3. **Advocate for Justice:** Educate yourself on the issues facing strangers in your community. Engage in discussions, write to your local representatives, and advocate for policies that support inclusiveness.
4. **Pray for Guidance:** Ask God to open your heart to those who feel like strangers. Pray for the courage to act, even when it feels uncomfortable.

Remember, welcoming the stranger is an act of worship. By extending grace and compassion, we reflect God’s love for humanity. Your small acts of kindness can create ripples of transformation both in individual lives and in the greater community.

- - - - - -

**Closing Prayer:**

Lord, thank You for the reminder that we are all part of Your family. Help us to be conduits of Your love, welcoming those who feel like strangers in our midst. May our hearts be compassionate, our minds open, and our actions just. Teach us to step beyond our comfort zones and honor You by embracing the diversity of Your creation. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.

- - - - - -

As you go through your week, let this theme of welcoming the stranger guide your thoughts and actions. Seek opportunities to embody justice and compassion—two virtues that reflect the heart of our Creator.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Nowhere hires me, if it's a bar or coffee shop. Everything else requires you to drive, have spent years in education or be trained.
I haven't been able to make a commitment to anything because I'm not well in my head, but being isolated has made me worse. Nowhere would hire me based on the few hours I can do without breaking down from being overwhelmed. But then I isolate and get overwhelmed further.

I feel trapped, Plymouth feels like prison and there are literally no support systems for finding work.

Don't say the job centre, they don't do anything, and haven't helped me in years. Same applies for the autistic/adhd, support groups. Everywhere wants a volunteer in a financial depression.
I'm exhausted, but if I don't earn any money I'll just end up homeless. Seriously I don't see what future I have being alive.
Anyone have a job they hate? I'll do it. 
Fuck I'd be a pest exterminator at this point. Or put down rabid dogs. I'll do something dangerous or gross if it pays me. I'd let you test a research chemical.on me if I got payed.

1h7mhin,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1h7mhin/postpartum_and_discouraged/,Postpartum and discouraged ,"Hey guys! I am 6 months postpartum. Before I was pregnant I worked a very active job and was active outside of work. When I got pregnant, I quit taking my adhd medication and more importantly, I quit smoking. The only downside was I replaced smoking with eating. I was also very depressed and understandably gained quite a bit of weight. I was 120 pounds pre-pregnancy. I am 5'6 and 165 pounds today. At the end of pregnancy I was 190 pounds. 

I am breastfeeding. The weight did not ""fall off"" like they said and it has made me hungrier than I've ever felt. It wasn't until recently that I heard more women say they didn't lose weight until they quit breastfeeding. I will be out of work until my child is 2. My child is also higher needs. I have a hard time not eating when I'm bored, which I'm always bored. When I was pregnant I allowed myself to eat ""bad"" foods and now it feels like I've lost control and can't stop eating those bad foods. I do not drink soda, only water and an occasional black coffee. 

I know how to lose the weight. I lost about 35 pounds 4 years ago. I'm super bummed that I gained it back and honestly extremely discouraged and depressed with how I look. I'm tracking my calories and bought a used treadmill off of marketplace. I've been trying to run everyday just to build the habit. Even if it's 10 minutes at a time or even a day. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice on what other steps to take or if anyone has been in a similar situation. Any tips or encouragement is appreciated! ",1,1733439563.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,0.6,False
1h7mf7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1h7mf7v/coffee_makes_mesleepy/,Coffee makes me…sleepy?,"Does anyone else just *crash* after coffee, regardless of taking their ADHD medication or not? I was a notorious sleeper during class in school and/or nap-taker until I was finally diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. However, one thing remains the same: coffee does nothing for me besides cause adverse effects. My go-to drink is a quad shot breve, and not only can I sleep whenever I want, I actually feel *more* inclined to sleep. It’s made me rarely drink coffee, but I always fall victim to drinking it thinking it will give me a little boost! And, I’m always disappointed! 

I’m curious because it sounds like this is often not the case, especially in those with ADHD. I feel a similar effect with nicotine and marijuana (so I only smoke sativa). It’s almost like my body just, shuts down to reset? Really curious to hear if others share this or thoughts on the root cause. Something of note is that I was also diagnosed as Bipolar along with ADHD, and I now take sedatives at night (and feel less tired during the day). But, this phenomenon has occurred far before I was aware of any of my diagnoses or medicated. It’s remained consistent throughout, although I’m happy to report I can now stay awake in graduate school!",3,1733439396.0,adhdwomen,4,0.72,False

Can’t wait to find a new normal!,"I’ve had Graves for 10+ yrs well controlled on a small dose of methimazole. Now after 2 babies (6mo pp w/ my second) it has been whack the whole time and I’ve felt awful. TT was the permanent solution for me since I also have thyroid eye disease. I just wanted to share my experience since reading others was helpful to me before going under- 

Scheduled at 1:30 and told to be there at 11:30. Told not to eat or drink after midnight the night before. Registered with surgery desk and waited 15mins before being called back and told to scrub down with CHG and put a purple gown on. They started an IV w/ a slow saline drip and drew some blood. Prior surgery case was running late so I waited 2hrs naked in my weird gown before it was my turn. The surgeon talked to me beforehand to answer questions as well as the anesthesiologist. The put an IV med in my line at 3:30 then I woke up and my husband told me it’s 9:45pm, like time travel it was so confusing. Surgery went perfect, calcium levels remain within normal limits, I can talk, pain at incision isn’t bad. I’m so thirsty though after every sip I feel nauseas and vomit due to the anesthesia. The surgery was 3hrs it just took me a long time to come to. They take me to the room I’ll stay in overnight and I have the best night sleep since I’m so tired and it’s the first time I’m sleeping without waking up to nurse my baby. The next day I’m scared to talk or move, they give me ibuprofen and acetaminophen alternating. Chewing is uncomfortable more so than swallowing since it’s the muscles of my neck that hurt more so than my throat or incision. But I’m so hungry I eat pancakes, eggs, yogurt, coffee and the buttered sourdough my husband brought from home. I’m still so so tired and my body feels weak, I sleep on and off until noon and they discharge me to go home, I can shower right away, just glue holding the incision together, it looks pretty gnarly but the pain is nothing compared to the c section I had in May. Wonderful to be able to lay down and take it easy at home when someone’s watching the kids, kind of hard to nurse the baby but by day 2 it’s fine and I can lift him and walk around and look around and yell at my 2yr old and it’s weird that I just had my neck cut open and I feel weak and tired and my neck hurts but life must go on and I’m still a mom. They said don’t lift more than 10lbs for 2wks but that must have been a joke since my baby is 19lbs and I don’t have a live in nanny to follow me around with him. Just a husband that’s entertaining the 35lb two year old and nursing his own cold (praying I don’t get it) I’m taking Ibuprofen and acetaminophen alternating every 6hrs and drinking lots of water, eating mostly soft food like thick soups, soft noodles, moist tea bread. Taking tums with every meal for a week to keep my calcium good. All in all recovery isn’t bad. If I didn’t have kids it would be an enjoyable week in bed with the tv and someone to boss around. Maybe I shouldn’t say enjoyable but having had a c section this surgery feels minor other than what a sensitive area the neck is. 

Swallowing is sensitive but not painful, talking and chewing strain the muscle and make me tired/sore, lifting strains the incision, but pain is well controlled on OTC meds. Ice pack for the front of the neck, heat pack for the back. (They prop your neck up so back of neck is sore too) sleep, sleep, sleep. Day 3 and im still so tired. 

Hope this helps someone else out there. Don’t be scared, we’re stuck taking meds the rest of our lives anyways, at least it’s easier to replace thyroid hormone than try and tame an angry one. ",6,1733439315.0,gravesdisease,2,0.88,False

With supply constrained by lack of development, there were only a few apartments to choose from. The closest apartment to my work place was on a street lined with old fourplexes that only had a two bedrooms. I sprung for one of the two bedroom units but the rent was higher than I wanted to pay on my own. 

I looked up airbnb listings in the area and the top host in the town had all five star reviews that mentioned her Keurig machine. I thought I could one up her if I got a better coffee machine and decorated my place well. Found a great deal at Williams Sonoma on the Gran Maestria where I stacked coupons and got it for under $200. My plan worked and over the next year I surpassed the top host in the area as the most reviewed host with all five star reviews. Several of my reviewers mentioned the ""fancy nespresso machine"" that made delicious lattes. 

I no longer host on Airbnb but I do still use the ""fancy nespresso machine"" everyday to make coffee. It is the only tech/appliance that I have from that long ago that still works flawlessly. Pretty impressive build quality by Nespresso.
