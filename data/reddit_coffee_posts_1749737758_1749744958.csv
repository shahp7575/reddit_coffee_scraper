1l9qg2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1l9qg2a/is_anyone_else_completely_over_the/,Is anyone else completely over the Aizawa/Bakugo/Shinso bashing machine?,"Alright, I need to get this off my chest. Look, I get it. Sometimes you wanna read a fic where a character gets taken down a peg. Fine! But holy hell, the absolute tsunami of identical fics ripping apart Aizawa, Bakugo, and Shinso in the exact same ways... it's making my soul leave my body. I feel like I'm stuck in a bad fanfic Groundhog Day.



Let me break down why this specific combo is driving me up the wall:



1.  Aizawa: Dude. I love a flawed teacher arc! But suddenly, he's not just flawed – he's a full-blown, mustache-twirling villain. He expels Izuku on Day 1 for being ""quirkless,"" which makes \*zero sense\* given the entrance exam he helped design. He ignores Bakugo trying to commit murder in the middle of class, fabricates evidence against Izuku, and apparently runs UA like his personal fiefdom of spite. His entire personality evaporates into ""hates Midoriya"" and ""coffee."" Where's the underground hero? seriously enough He's reduced to a cardboard cutout labeled ""Evil Obstacle."" It feels lazy and completely ignores any nuance he might have.



2.  Bakugo: Okay, yes, he's a massive jerk. Complex? Absolutely. Traumatized kid with a warped worldview? Sure. But in these fics? Poof! All gone. He becomes this one-dimensional rage monster who tries to murder Izuku constantly – in broad daylight, in class, on camera – and faces \*literally zero consequences\*. UA just shrugs? The police vanish? He becomes less of a character and more of a screaming plot device whose only job is to make Izuku look good by comparison. It strips away everything interesting about his potential for growth or conflict. He's just... loud evil. And it gets old fast.



3.  Shinso: This one genuinely baffles me. How did the kid with the ""villainous"" quirk, who's cynical but clearly hurt by discrimination, become the poster child for quirkist, lazy, undeserving golden boys? Suddenly he's Aizawa's secret pet project/love child, waltzing in with a massive superiority complex, sneering at Izuku about his quirk status (the irony is painful!), and instantly stealing everyone's affection, Izuku's spot, and sometimes even OFA?! His mind control becomes this OP, ethically bankrupt tool he uses for petty crap. It feels like pure character assassination just to have another target for Izuku to overcome. Why?? He had his own interesting story!



Seriously, why this unholy trinity \*every single time? Is it just because they're obstacles in Izuku's path? Is it \*that\* hard to find conflict elsewhere in this massive world? Did one popular fic start this and now everyone's just hitting copy-paste?



I'm not saying bashing can't ever be fun. A well-written ""what if they were worse?"" scenario \*can\* be interesting. But this? It's not exploration. It's paint-by-numbers character demolition. It's the same beats, the same caricatures, the same lazy conflict in hundreds of fics:



\*   Aizawa expels Izuku unfairly (Check!).

\*   Bakugo is a consequence-free psycho (Check!).

\*   Shinso is the smug, undeserving replacement who steals everything (Check!).

\*   Izuku gets an instant OP power-up and effortlessly crushes them (Check!).



\*   \*\*Actual nuance.\*\* Show me Aizawa making a \*bad call\* based on bias or bad info, and then \*grappling with it\*. Show me Bakugo facing \*realistic\* consequences for his actions, struggling with his issues, maybe even starting a painful journey towards being less awful – without turning him into a cartoon. Let Shinso just \*be Shinso\* – skeptical, maybe a bit jaded, dealing with his own quirk baggage, not some lazy caricature of undeserved privilege.

\*   \*\*Conflict that isn't ""Everyone at UA is inexplicably evil and hates Izuku specifically."" There are villains! There's societal pressure! There's self-doubt! There are other students with their own issues! \*Anything\* else!

\*   \*\*Stories that treat these characters like complex people with flaws and potential, not just narrative punching bags designed to make Izuku look cool.



Am I just burnt out? Have I read one too many of these? Does anyone else feel this overwhelming sense of ""Ugh, again?"" when they see this trio bashed in the exact same way? Or am I yelling into the void here? Please tell me I'm not alone in wanting something... more?



TL;DR: The constant, identical bashing of Aizawa, Bakugo, and Shinso in MHA fics feels incredibly lazy, repetitive, and strips away all character nuance. It's exhausting and creatively bankrupt.",1,1749744698.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,0.67,False

My PC is only around 2 years old and has been relatively issue free since I’ve bought it.  Just about a week ago I was enjoying my day off with a few hours of gaming.  I left my PC on a game I was playing while I went downstairs to make coffee.  

Upon my return, I’ve noticed my displays went black, but the RGB lights and cooling fans were still running.  I touched the power button and the PC turned off immediately.  After trying to turn the PC back on, the RGB lights and Cooling Fans turned on again, but the displays remained black. A red light appeared on the GPU near the PCIe adapter, and the MSI Motherboard shows a white light labeled “VGA”.

I’ve attempted some basic troubleshooting by disconnecting the GPU and trying a different PCIe slot, and trying to refit some of the connections.  So far my PC will not boot with the GPU connected.  I have only been able to get a successful post when the GPU is disconnected, but of course no display.

Starting with the new machine, casabrews ultra, within a few learning shots I was able to begin getting consistent shots of espresso with good crema, taking around 31 seconds according to the built in timer. This was always pre ground dunks coffee, using the double wall basket. 

I’ve since ordered the tuni grinder, and picked up some fresh whole beans (wegmans medium roast with very recent roast date).

With the grinder and new beans, if I mimic my old formula of grind size set for drip, and use the double wall basket, I can still get good crema and a 31 second pull time, 

Now for the hard part. 

I tried switching out to the single wall basket and used an espresso setting on the Tuni. I cannot get any crema nor a shot time over 24-25 seconds. I have tried about 20 different shots so far using every espresso setting on the grinder, changing the amount of grounds (including up to the basket max after tamping), and even adjusting tamp pressure from ~20-30lbs up to my entire body weight. None of this has made any difference other than creating some extra bitter shots. Still no crema, still short shot times. 

I am assuming it’s the grinder not getting fine enough on its finest setting but wanted to see if I’m missing something. 

My next step is going to be to exchange the grinder for a breville bcg400sil. If that still doesn’t work, I may just stick with the double wall basket.

Diagnosis: I have (not am) Bipolar 1 and have exhibited delusions with psychotic features that have also included auditory hallucinations & visuals unmedicated with no emergency plan. I would also like to add that I was smoking pot and drinking a whole lotta coffee, with a really toxic person I was in a relationship with that would leave me alone for long periods of time but was hell when they would come back & argue with me because they were manipulating the living situation, so I began to self isolate and shut off everyone else.

Med Regimen: (I use a daily MS & PRN approach with AP’s because I have severe med sensitivities to EPS/TD.) - I worked very hard on collaborating with my psychiatrist on this who highly agreed & approved with my dual conditions.

Daily: 300mg of Lamictal as my main mood stabilizer | Doctor recently removed Latuda 20mg! after being almost 6 months post a manic episode 

Wellbutrin 150 XR for depression 

PRN: Clonzepam 0.5 for anxiety, irritation, depression

Seroquel 25mg-300mg for racing thoughts, sleep disturbances that melatonin, tea, or magnesium can’t fix, severe anxiety, impulsive thoughts, & pre-hypomanic symptoms. 

Nearly added PRN: Zyprexa 10mg fast acting disolving tablet to be administered by family if THEY notice something is off before it escalates into a full blown episode or psychotic symptoms where judgement begins to get seriously impaired. They would ensure to bring me to a quiet place, tell me the stakes in a firm but gentle manner - Hospital or Pills, call my psychiatrist and schedule an immediate appointment and decide on an outpatient clinic in case symptoms do not subside within 2-3 days.

*Bonus - Having a Psychiatric Advance Directive uploaded to your emergency chart at home & at any hospital you have visited or plan to if things escalate with allergies to meds that cause adverse symptoms.

I also am going to be ordering a medical bracelet soon so I can feel safer traveling or at work!

If something were to arise that would tell my allergies (Haldol, Risperdal, and High Dose Dopamine Blocking Meds) - Usually the first gens | No Lithium mixed with an antipsychotic. No doubling 2 different antipsychotics & having the directive use the meds advised to treat me. For example, giving me an Abilify shot instead of a Haldol shot upon leaving the hospital. Things like that.

Aside from that, the goal is not to get there. 

I take important brain supplements: Vitamin E, Omega 3, Magnesium, B-Complex.

I’m exploring the keto diet 

I do not use any unprescribed drugs/substance use - aside from coffee and I am working on ordering mushroom coffee that has Lions Mane. 

Working on getting out of a toxic relationship through therapy & to forgive myself 

Attending support groups: DBSA & NAMI, along with a church group I go to. 

Getting sunlight at least 15 minutes a day. Ideally more with exercise (working on this) because I am still battling depression. I lost so much during my last episode because I was still in denial of my condition & wasn’t getting treated. 

Working on a healthy work/life balance 30 hours a week. 

Considering fostering instead of having a biological child. - This part makes me sad but think it is for the best.

Episodes:

3 full blown manic episodes with psychosis that all ended up in hospitalization. I was unmedicated and in denial of my condition, and abusing substances in each.

Oh, did we just talk about meds & dosages? 🤭 

*This is not medical advice. Find a psychiatrist that is willing to listen to your needs & use their medical expertise to help you find solutions that work best for your mind/body for better adherence to taking your meds. ",2,1749743769.0,BipolarAnything,2,1.0,False

After a short panic attack and two coffees, I remembered someone on Reddit had mentioned KoalaEssays, so I gave them a shot. Honestly, I didn’t expect miracles — just hoped they could help me not fail.

To my surprise, they were super responsive. I dropped the topic, a rough idea of what I needed, and they paired me with a writer almost immediately. What stood out was how collaborative it felt — the writer asked clarifying questions, suggested a quick structure, and wasn’t just blindly typing away. Definitely didn’t feel like some copy-paste job from the internet.

In just under 5 hours, I got a fully written paper back. Solid arguments, proper citations, and it actually followed my professor’s weirdly specific instructions. Not only did I make the deadline, but I also didn’t have to rewrite half of it (which I usually expect when using any college paper writing service).

This was my first real experience with custom writing on such short notice, and I get now why people say [koalaessays.net](http://koalaessays.net) is among the best assignment writing service options out there.

I AM an adult. And yet, every time a controversial topic comes up (like deli sandwiches, coffee, etc), they feel the need to go on a ten minute rant about how it can affect the mother and baby. They always tell me things I already knew. And they CONTINUE to do it until my husband says something about how the doctor said it’s fine. Like me, the pregnant woman, apparently doesn’t know anything. The only one with credible information is apparently my husband. Just the other day actually, I was talking about how I’m excited to go on vacation next week. My FIL, unprompted, goes on a rant about how I need to stay away from hot tubs. And then proceeds to tell me WHY I need to stay away from hot tubs. Does he really think I don’t know the rules of pregnancy?

This is what I piled on today after the rain and then when I mixed it (poorly). It's not a lot and sitting in a very shady area on concrete... but by next summer, we should have enough to use + compost giveback from the city. 

I don't have room for a second pile so this will have to do and the plan is to just leave it alone by next April for May/June repotting. 

How are we looking?

1l9ppxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1l9ppxy/assumption_that_i_always_get_what_i_want_is_not/,"Assumption that I always get what I want is not as fun anymore, anyone else experience this shift?","I've been trying to find reference in Neville's work if he mentions a shift like this. If anyone else knows of one, please share.  
  
I've consistently gotten what I wanted (from health changes to money to free items to free trips to new friends to epiphanies or answers to questions etc). But lately, I've realized it might be better for me to get what I need. What I mean by that is, getting what I need just feels more fulfilling. It's a little funny because for now, I have to actually want what I need each time since I already have the assumption ""I always get what I want"".   
  
A generic example: let's say I want a free coffee, I'd get it however it manifests (friend treating me, getting it for free at the café, etc..) But let's say I'm trying out getting what I need (while knowing I want coffee) and instead of me getting a coffee, my friend comes over with tea as a treat. I might react from all this manifesting stuff in my head and feel like well this isn't what I wanted, but when I drink it, I'd feel so good like oh I needed this and be so glad she brought me a tea instead of a coffee because the quality of my experience would be so good. Maybe it's deep warmth, the herb blend or taste, idk, I wouldn't analyze but it would just be what I needed. I'd feel fuller than I would have had I received that coffee instead, which would have satisfied my mind because it's a manifestation fulfilled but it's just like life is not as deep as when I intend for what I need. It's still a desire manifesting (desire for what I need overriding desire for what I want (in this case coffee)), but I'm thinking of somehow switching my mindset over so I don't have to continuously want it for it to happen.

(and I've done this where this is like a bbl and I do end up getting the free coffee too but it's just not as deep my experience)  
  
Reason I'm posting this here is I was curious if anyone else has experienced a shift like this? A different example would be, let's say someone is trying to manifest revenge, and when they get it, it just feels empty like ok so what now? Had they asked for what they needed, maybe they would have gotten justice *and* peace and actually felt freed from the situation and been able to move on with life.

(I want to add, I started off not assuming I know what I need, and it made life more fun this way too, like there is surprise and I'm not always having to be in conscious control. But now I know I can know *what* if need be. And often times, it's things I didn't even know existed, so how would I have manifested it otherwise without leaving the door open that I don't know)

This might just be my problem because I have only been manifesting from desires for a while, not thoughts/assumptions taking precedence but I'm asking in case anyone else has their own take! I'd love to hear about it, and maybe you prefer getting what you want and applying a method for that because that feels more empowering to you. This is just my current experience :) but it's a huge shift for me. 

(and it isn't about giving up on your manifestations, I just *wanted* more from life than what I think I know, and in line with the idea that ""**I always get what I want**"", this has been delivered as a manifestation.)

Well, maybe I also sent greetings on Christmas or birthday greetings. Yes, I’m sure I did. 

But it never crossed my mind that the most important thing to build up your consultancy or freelance practice - is to talk to your clients when you DO NOT have any projects at hand. 

The thing is that those - and only those - type of interactions are actually the ones which make the word of mouth work. Think of it for a moment. If you’re talking to your clients only when you have an assignment (meaning - they pay you) you miss an opportunity to create relationship. They payed - you’ve performed as promised. Everyone is happy. You might think as a pro that this is a good reason to recommend you further. Why? Do you often post a review when you’re happy with the product or a service? I bet not. Why do you think your Clients would promote you then? The deal is done. 

BUT - what they would do - they would eagerly answer your call or accept an invite for a coffee sometimes after the project is over. You may just meet them and ask how their business is doing and what do they work on now. I promise you, that if you’ll do that 2-3 times a year - well, in a year you’ll be the only consultant who still keeps such contact. And you’ll be the first one who comes into his mind when asked for a reference. As one of my mentors put it: I meet with the clients not do discuss current projects, but to find  out their future needs.

Hi Charlotte and all my fellow Reddit users. I am sorry for the long and confusing post but I have had this on my mind for awhile and wanted some opinions so here we go. I (30f) met a friend (33f) online 4 years ago through a mutual person we followed online. When we started getting to know each other more, she told me that she doesn’t have any friends at all and I felt bad for her. I told her that I will be her friend. That was the first red flag I ignored. We got very close when the guy we were both following started doing lives. There were many desperate women trying to get closer to him and to get him to fall in love with them. I always spoke with him as if he was a friend because that’s how I am with everyone no matter who they are and I wasn’t interested in him in that way anyways. I noticed when my friend and I got closer, she started trying to copy me in some ways so she can also be funny and entertaining. I just ignored it because she was my friend and I was just trying to enjoy my time. 

Eventually there was drama with the desperate girls online that felt the need to bully me and my friends because they felt intimidated by us so I decided to leave the situation behind. I still remained good friends with my friend. After that situation I stopped joining people’s lives. After about 6 months, my friend invites me to join the live of a guy she has been watching for 3 months. I found it odd that she never mentioned him before and I got the weird feeling that she wanted to get closer to him before introducing me so she can have an advantage over me. She was telling me how she’s so in love with him even though they barely know each other and don’t speak to each other any special way. I got to know him and started joking with him and chatting with him trying to enjoy the lives. She confessed her feelings for this guy via email and told him she knows where he lives (she really does because he opened a package on live and accidentally showed his address so she made sure to keep note). Sometimes the way she would talk about him or any other guy kind of creeped me out because it was insanely obsessive but it was a little moment of psychotic episode and she will go back to normal. 

That year we wanted to travel to a different country together since we never had anyone to go with. My only real friend was a mother of 2 living in the U.S. and we are complete opposites so she doesn’t like the same things I like. We spent the next 2 years planning to visit the country we wanted to go to but we always had to cancel because something always came up with me or her. So in September, I lost my dog who meant the world to me and I was completely devastated. I had been saving money to finally move out on my own and also go to the trip comfortably at that time. My dog got sick unexpectedly and I had to spend the savings that I had to take her to the hospital and run all the tests and treatments but it didn’t work. Since I love retail therapy and I was extremely sad, I decided to book the flight with the the remaining amount of savings that I had. 

My friend never took action until I told her that I already booked the tickets. During my time of grief, she introduced me to someone else’s live and told me I should join to get my mind off of things so I started joining. The guy and the other viewers were so kind to me so I decided to join more often. I noticed she would do the same thing where she would start trying to copy me to try to get attention from the guy. I was the only viewer of his that was close in age with him so we became more friendly and started messaging each other. I didn’t tell my friend at first because I didn’t want her to go crazy jealous again but one day we were having a convo and I was forced to tell her that I am talking to him and his friends (twins) through DMs sometimes but mostly just him. She started shipping me and him even though I told her there was nothing at all between us. I didn’t mention much after that because she started following me to his friend’s lives too. Well one day the convo between me and the guy crossed a bit of a line and I was really shocked because I have never done anything like that with anyone. I have always refused. So I spoke to her because I wanted advice to see if I really should be doing this. 

She seemed fine and was encouraging me to continue but by his next live she had started showing up to his lives again and trying to interact more even though she had stopped joining his lives. Me and him wanted to keep things a secret but my friend was making it so obvious that she knows something. Then suddenly she was saying how cute his twin friends are and that she doesn’t know who she loves more. She never had an interest in them before. Mind you, she already had a long distance boyfriend but she was still trying to find love with all the men that would even pay attention to her. So eventually the guy I was talking to asked me out for coffee when I go visit his country and I had agreed. I told my friend about it and she was supposedly excited for me. Most of the people I know from that country also wanted to meet me because I became good friends with them. I eventually managed to escape from the guy and kind of stopped talking to him. I had also decided that I didn’t want to meet with him anymore because I don’t want to leave my friend alone on vacation. The whole point of us going there was for us to meet for the first time and have fun exploring the country. 

While I was waiting for my flight, I was bored so I went to the guy’s live and he DMed me asking if we were still going to meet up. I gave him a little excuse and left it at that. Well right when my friend and I got to the hotel from the airport, she immediately downloaded tinder and started matching with every single guy she could. She said she was only looking for “friends”. Even though I was the only single one of us, I decided I didn’t want to try finding love with an app known for hookups but instead I wanted to actually enjoy exploring the country since it’s my first time traveling internationally. 2 days into our trip, the guy I was talking to was still trying to meet up with me but I was just kept brushing him off. Well it seems my friend went into her crazy spiral again and she started asking all the men out to meet her since this guy wanted to meet up with me. So the next day she planned to meet up with the first guy. We wasted the whole day doing nothing because she wanted to stay close to the hotel so she can get ready for the date. 

While she left me alone at the hotel, I didn’t dare to go anywhere because I have a fear of getting lost. I was in a new country and I didn’t know how transportation worked since it’s not a usual thing where I’m from. One of my online friends felt bad for me and he ordered me some traditional food to the hotel. Then the guy I was talking to messaged me for the day and asked what I’m doing. When he found out about my situation, he told me to meet up with him so I’m not alone. I kept making excuses still and eventually I did something that I have never done as an independent woman and I told him that if he pays for my taxi to go see him, I will go. I didn’t expect him to agree since he was already paying for a hotel so I genuinely thought about going.

 I decided to go since my friend left me for the day so I won’t be feeling guilty. So as I was getting ready to leave, she showed up to the hotel and I let her know I was going. It was already really late into the night. As I spent the night with him, she was desperately on tinder again even messaging guys she had matched with 4 years ago and started planning to go out with them each day even though I told her I’m not meeting up with him or anyone else again. So that was basically the whole trip, we did some short sightseeing and then we have to go back to the hotel early so she can get ready for her dates. She even went to the places we were supposed to go to with her dates and I was left at the hotel without seeing the beautiful sights. Every time before she left she could tell I was bothered and she would ask if I’m ok even though she knows the answer but I am the person who hates confrontation so I just let her keep pretending she doesn’t know what she’s doing messed up. 

I will forever hate myself for not getting the courage to speak up for myself and also for not exploring the country by myself while she was out but I will take the opportunity next time when I go on my own. So the night that she found “the one” (yes she still had the long distance boyfriend btw) she stayed at his place. Well one of my other friends owns a business and he wanted to meet me. I had to go anyways because I had to have a serious talk with him about some serious drama that was happening in his lives and there were many girls relying on me to speak to him about it. Since my friend was wasting time on this trip, I decided to finally get the courage to go out on my own so I can go visit him. As I was getting ready to leave, my friend came back to the hotel and asked if I wanted her to go with me. I said no for 2 reasons. 1. I was still mad at her actions and 2. My friend is extremely handsome and I didn’t want her to bring her craziness to make things uncomfortable. The reason I didn’t meet up with anyone else is also because they know about her crazy side and they were scared I would have to bring her with me to meet up with them.

I did get lost a little on the way there but I did it. I spoke to him about what I needed to tell him and I took my time going back to meet up with my friend. I was actually gatekeeping all the lives I watch from her because of her behavior but unfortunately since we were sharing a hotel room, almost all of the lives from them popped up on her page. Naturally she tried to join them and get their attention but they didn’t give her attention even though I was introducing her as my friend so she left quickly. While she was in one of the twins lives, he asked her what it was like meeting me. I expected her to say anything except “she’s exactly like I thought she would be”. I was offended but I stayed quiet. Even the twin was confused by that answer. Then one day she asked me to take a video of her from the hotel window because she was across the street. Then she posted it on Instagram and called me “friend” instead of best friend because that’s what we were supposed to be since we always call each other bestie so I finally started opening my eyes to everything that has ever happened and I decided I didn’t want to continue being friends with her because she was hurting me a lot but I had to hold it in since we were still in a new country and I still needed her to finish paying her half of the trip especially since I lost my job 3 days before going on the trip. 

Towards the end of the trip she kept obsessing over “the one” and was trying to make future plans with him. I spent every day listening to her complaining and getting depressed how she’s so fat and ugly and that the guy only went out with her out of pity just because he wasn’t texting back right away during work hours and then right when we were so close to finally getting to one of the tourist areas that I wanted to see, he sent her a message asking if she wanted to sleep over his place. She immediately did a U turn and forced me to go to the hotel while she went directly to see him. After our trip ended, I found a relatable post on instagram that was kind of towards the situation that happened on the trip but she assumed I was talking about the guy that I really have a crush on. She was so happy that she started talking to me more than usual. Well 2 days later I tell her casually how someone told me something. So she said “let me guess. Your guy or your friend who bought you food during the trip” I could immediately feel how hostile she got. 

This was after we had a conversation where I was encouraging her and giving her advice on how to be able to work from that country after her manager said no. I have always been supportive of her but when it came to my stuff, she would be cold. A few minutes later I told her about something and all she said was a dry “good”. After this I decided I wanted to stop talking to her. She hurt me so much and I couldn’t take it anymore so I just stopped talking the way I usually do. I was no longer enthusiastic. She would send me reels and I would just react to them and not say anything. The next day, she proudly told me that her manager finally said she can work from the country. Since I was mad with her and other things, I felt like I had become colder so I decided to do something I’ve never done before and I chose to give back the same energy that is being given to me. So I told her “good” and I took my social media break because I was dealing with her crap and also a bunch of other girls online hating me for getting attention from all the lives that I go to just because I am always nice and entertaining with everyone. Everything started affecting me.

So one day I went to vent to the guy I hung out with because he knows my situation with my friend and he asked me to join his live because he wanted to help me get my mind off of it. Guess who decided to show up for no reason? You guessed it. I was actually enjoying myself for the first time and she showed up, saw me there, and instead of saying hi to me first as usual, she started talking to him telling him that she just bought her ticket to the county again and that him and her will be neighbors. As soon as she said that, I instantly knew that meant that after she found out I was still happily talking to the guy I like, she went crying to “the one” to take her back after she had made him so uncomfortable from all the pushing she was doing and she had broken up with him. She also broke up with her long distance boyfriend because she was planning to be with “the one” but she had no one so she literally picked up a random guy from the street in her country and asked him for a date. 

The only reason I knew she got back with the guy was because I know he was the only one out of all the guys she went out with that lives in the same city as the guy I hung out with. When my friend was telling this guy about that, he knew how hurt I was with her so he didn’t really pay her much attention. Just politely responded a little and then after she got that out of her chest, that’s when she decided to say hi to me and pretend like nothing happened. I was just doing the same thing as the guy honestly lol. I was not energetic as I usually am and just decided to be a little polite. Then she finally left. The only reason I even stayed on the live was because I had promised the guy I would stay. I kept posting things on my stories that I can relate too and she tried to fake concern (only when I posted) and then I finally decided to tell her something I have been wanting to tell her since she found out about me and the guy, but I lied to her a little. I told her to back off from him a little because he is getting suspicious. It really was true but I made it seem like he was currently starting to suspect things more.

I am the kind of person who hates to lie but I was not in a good place mentally so I started acting like everyone around me. Not my finest moment but what’s done is done. I also wanted her to back off from my life because her energy always changes when I am succeeding in anything so I lied to her and told her that I ghosted the guy I like and that I won’t be talking to him anymore and that I decided to not go through with my future plans. I told her that lie so she can be satisfied with the results and leave me alone. Me as a friend, I would do everything to cheer her up and motivate her but when I gave her the (fake) news she just said “ok” and moved on. That just further confirmed the kind of “friendship” this really was. After a while I posted more stories and eventually she had the feeling the posts were about her so she tried to confront me and say I was being cold to her and that I am not telling her about my life anymore and just playing victim as if she doesn’t know her behavior so I decided the new me was going to start defending myself and I told her some of what was bothering me about what she had been doing lately and I told her what I have been dealing with. After that, she ignored my messages for a few days. Then she responded again trying to act like she really cares about me and I just stay cold.

I decided she is not my friend anymore and that I should have listened to everyone else sooner when they told me she’s a horrible friend. I didn’t want to be too mean to her though because she knows too much about me and she is capable of exposing my secret with me and the guy. I kept things civil but I will no longer be friends with her or tell her about my life or plans. She still thinks to this day that I am still in my rock bottom phase but thankfully I got myself out of the depression and started motivating myself to work out more and keep planning my future in private. I don’t want any more bad energy in my life. So AITAH or was I overreacting?",0,1749742638.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.5,False

I have been researching EoE since having heartburn symptoms (burning in chest, neck and face, as well as more general chest and upper abdominal pain and tightness) for the past 6 months. I also often have a raw/dry feeling in my throat in the evenings and occasional cough, although not often. An ultrasound and blood work I had done in January was all normal.  I tried PPIs and cutting out heartburn-inducing foods (coffee, alcohol, tomato sauce, chocolate etc...) for 3 months with no overall improvement. Finally got a gastroscopy a week ago which left the GI ""at a loss to explain my symptoms"" since everything was normal. I should get the standard biopsy results in 3-6 weeks - it includes biopsies for celiac and H. pylori, but I don't know if the biopsy they took from my esophagus will screen for EoE. 

I have allergies to birch pollen and corresponding oral allergy syndrome to some raw stone fruits, some raw tree nuts, raw apples, and a few other things. I've never been tested for food allergies other than kiwi, which was negative. But reading this I am wondering if EoE could be the culprit of my symptoms - even with nothing showing up visually on the scope? The past 2 weeks I've been following an anti-inflammatory diet (including no gluten or dairy) without a lot of improvement so far, but the past few days I've been noticing it seems my symptoms are flaring up after I eat nut butters, tree nuts, and possibly tahini.

Anyone had this experience?? Apparently EoE in response to tree nuts is more rare than EoE in response to diary, wheat, soy etc...I would love to hear if anyone has had a similar symptoms and/or confirmed that their EoE is mainly due to nuts.

# Best Dough Bowl Candle 2025: Find Your Perfect Scent

The dough bowl candle has transcended mere home fragrance to become a coveted decor accent, blending rustic charm with aromatic luxury. These candles offer more than just a pleasant scent; thay provide a unique aesthetic, adding warmth and character to any space.As we move into 2025, the market is saturated with options, making it crucial to discern the best from the rest. This guide will navigate you through the key features, benefits, and considerations when selecting your perfect dough bowl candle.

[[Explore Top Rated dough bowl candle on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=dough bowl candle)

## key features Analysis

The dough bowl candle market offers a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials, leading to a complex selection process. To simplify, we look at some features that differentiate ordinary candles from the best in 2025.

**Bowl Material and Construction:** The quality of the dough bowl itself is paramount.

Typically, these bowls are crafted from wood, frequently enough reclaimed or sustainably sourced.The best dough bowl candles utilize hardwoods like oak or maple, known for thier durability and attractive grain patterns.Construction quality is essential; look for bowls that are smoothly sanded, properly sealed to prevent wax leakage, and free from splinters or imperfections. The bowl's size and shape also play a role in the overall aesthetic appeal and burn time of the candle.

**Wax Blend and Composition:** The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle's performance and environmental footprint.

Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean burning properties, biodegradability, and ability to hold fragrance well. Beeswax is another option, prized for its natural honey scent and long burn time, but it tends to be more expensive. Paraffin wax, a petroleum byproduct, is less desirable due to its potential for soot and environmental concerns. The best dough bowl candles utilize a blend of natural waxes, such as soy and coconut, to optimize both fragrance throw and burn quality.

**Fragrance Profile and Intensity:** Aroma forms the core function of any candle.

The quality and complexity of the fragrance are critical elements. Look for candles that use essential oils or high-quality fragrance oils formulated to provide a balanced and long-lasting aroma. The fragrance profile should align with your personal preferences, ranging from floral and fruity to woody and spicy. Intensity is also crucial; a well-made dough bowl candle should fill a room without being overpowering.

**Wick Type and Configuration:** The wick contributes greatly to how the candle burns and exudes scent.

The type and number of wicks influence the burn pool and overall performance of the candle. Wooden wicks provide a distinctive crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, while cotton wicks are a more traditional option. the size of the wick must be appropriate for the diameter of the bowl to ensure an even burn and prevent tunneling (wax buildup on the sides).High-quality dough bowl candles frequently enough feature multiple wicks strategically placed to maximize fragrance diffusion and prevent uneven burning

**Burn Time and Safety:** An excellent candle will burn safely and for a reasonable period of time.Burn time is a crucial consideration, varying depending on the size of the bowl, wax type, and fragrance load. A quality dough bowl candle should boast a burn time of at least 50 hours, ideally more for larger bowls. Safety is paramount; ensure the candle is placed on a heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials.Never leave a burning candle unattended.

**Aesthetics and Craftsmanship:** Dough bowl candles are typically selected to complement room decor.

The overall aesthetic and craftsmanship of the candle contribute significantly to its appeal as a decorative item. Look for candles that feature unique designs, such as hand-poured wax patterns, embedded botanicals, or carefully selected color palettes. The bowl itself should be well-crafted and visually appealing,adding rustic charm to any space.Attention to detail is key,from the smooth finish of the bowl to the precise placement of the wicks.

## FAQs Section

**How do I properly care for my dough bowl candle?**
To maximize the lifespan and performance of your dough bowl candle, trim the wicks to ¼ inch before each use. This prevents smoking and ensures an even burn. Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time, as this can cause the wax to overheat and perhaps damage the bowl. Always place the candle on a heat-resistant surface and keep it away from flammable materials.

**Can I reuse the dough bowl after the candle is finished?**
Yes, the dough bowl can be repurposed after the candle is finished. Carefully remove any remaining wax by placing the bowl in the freezer for a few hours, which will cause the wax to shrink and easily pop out. You can then clean the bowl with warm, soapy water and use it for decorative purposes, such as holding small items, displaying potpourri, or serving as a rustic accent piece.

**Are dough bowl candles safe for pets and children?**
While dough bowl candles are generally safe, it's essential to take precautions to ensure the safety of pets and children. Keep the candle out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidental burns or ingestion of wax. Never leave a burning candle unattended. If you have pets with sensitive respiratory systems, consider choosing candles with natural scents and avoiding those with strong synthetic fragrances.

**How do I choose the right scent for my space?**
Selecting the right scent for your space depends on personal preferences and the desired atmosphere. Floral scents like lavender and rose are ideal for creating a relaxing and calming environment, while citrus scents like lemon and grapefruit can invigorate and energize a room. Woody scents like sandalwood and cedarwood add warmth and sophistication, while spicy scents like cinnamon and clove create a cozy and inviting ambiance. Consider the size of the room and the intensity of the fragrance when making your selection

1l9pip0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1l9pip0/30_m4f_india_lets_win_the_lottery_of_life/,30 [M4F] India - Let’s Win the Lottery of Life.,"Life deals us all different hands : some get born into wealth, others into chaos, some inherit brilliant minds, others beautiful hearts. I’ve learned to play my cards with gratitude rather than resentment. Sure, I got lucky with a few things: a mind that won’t quit asking questions, legs long enough to reach the good coffee on high shelves, and just enough restless curiosity to keep chasing dreams even when they seem impossible.

Here’s what I know for certain: somewhere out there, among billions of beating hearts and busy lives, is someone meant for me. Not in some cosmic destiny way, though I’m not ruling out a little universe magic :but in that wonderfully human way where two people look at each other and think, “Yes, you. I choose you.”

Because while we’re stuck with the families we’re born into (love them anyway), the person we fall in love with? That’s pure choice. We love them for their terrible jokes and their brilliant insights, for the way they hum while cooking and how they scrunch their nose when they’re concentrating. We love them not despite their flaws, but because those flaws make them uniquely, perfectly them.

I want that kind of love: the kind that’s built, not just felt. The kind that chooses to stay when things get complicated, because they always do.

A Little About Me : 
I’m one of those people who can work a room but also disappear into a book for hours. At 6’2”, I’m excellent at being a human periscope at concerts and reaching things you’ve given up on. I spend my days building tech companies and my evenings trying to make sense of international diplomacy and law. because apparently I enjoy complex puzzles in all forms.

When I’m not buried in work, you’ll find me lost in a good book, plotting my next chess move, hiking trails that promise views worth the climb, or floating in water somewhere (pools, oceans, lakes, I’m not picky). I’ve been collecting passport stamps across 15+ countries, always planning the next adventure.

I meditate to stay sane, do yoga to stay flexible (in body and mind), and I’ve mastered the art of being productively ambitious without losing my soul to the hustle.

Where You Come In

If you’ve made it this far, maybe something in these words resonated. Maybe you’re also looking for someone who believes that the best relationships aren’t found.they’re built, day by day, choice by choice.

Maybe this is how our story starts: not with fireworks or orchestras, but with two people who decided to be brave enough to reach out across the digital void and say hello.

After all, the best love stories always begin with someone taking a chance.

It’s unsettling, especially when you’re surrounded by people you believe to be like-minded crypto enthusiasts. But it’s the truth – and it’s becoming more common.*

https://preview.redd.it/rtjpsi6omi6f1.jpg?width=3070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8d7b029997ef43c7b540a8c9fa5e2c3530e6be7

**By Nick Percoco, Kraken Chief Security Officer**

Each year, crypto conferences are growing larger and becoming more global. From New York to Dubai to Singapore, there are in-person opportunities to engage with peers across the crypto community. These gatherings are one sign that crypto has reached an inflection point in mainstream adoption. 

But with that growth, a quiet but troubling trend has also emerged: Personal security hygiene at crypto conferences has taken a back seat. This trend surfaced before the recent high-profile crypto kidnappings. Unfortunately, the crypto community has grown emboldened to publicly display and openly discuss crypto topics — even wealth and high-value trades — in public settings.  

Crypto, at its core, is about being your own bank. And it is incredibly difficult (if not impossible) to achieve the promise of financial freedom if your personal security and operational security (op-sec) aren’t prioritized above all else. 

Kraken’s dedicated security team has been monitoring this trend while attending industry conferences. Here’s what they’re seeing, and what every attendee needs to keep in mind:

# Basic situational awareness is often ignored

While walking around networking events and expo areas, our teams have identified unmanned laptops owned by popular crypto protocols left open and unlocked on work settings. Likewise, they’ve highlighted many instances of phones unguarded on tables, even as wallet notifications ping in real time.

If you’re in crypto, your digital device is not just a phone or a laptop. It’s a vault to you, your cryptoassets and your broader employer’s operation. Always keep your devices in close proximity and locked when you are not using them. 

# Openly broadcasting wealth and high-value trades

One of our team members walked out of their hotel room one evening, several miles from a conference venue, and encountered several attendees discussing high-value trades while wearing lanyards from the conference that included their name and company.

Even if you don’t think anyone’s listening, someone very well might be. Be discreet to protect yourself and those around you.

# Public spaces are not secure

Just like you wouldn’t blindly trust WiFi at a busy coffee shop, you should be even more cautious at crypto conferences. Public networks can be easily spoofed or compromised, and crypto events are full of highly technical individuals, including those with hacking skills. It only takes one bad actor to exploit an unprotected connection. 

# Think twice before scanning QR codes

They’re everywhere at crypto events, from giveaways to product demos, but each scan could expose your wallet to malicious smart contracts designed to drain your wallet. It only takes a single sticker swap for a bad actor to replace a legitimate QR code on a marketing material with a fake one, putting dozens (if not hundreds) of attendees at risk.

While we haven’t seen recent reports of this in the wild, the risk remains real. A safer approach is to use a burner wallet with limited funds specifically for conference activities. That way, if something goes wrong, your primary holdings remain protected.

# Be careful who you trust, and what you reveal

Not everyone in a conference t-shirt is who they say they are. It is very easy to build cover stories, and register under fake personas, while at events. We always recommend verifying identities and limiting sensitive conversations to secure channels, or as follow-ups after in-person events. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

But that’s not all. Our team is acutely aware of less obvious, but equally serious, risks associated with attending events. Always keep a close watch on your food and drinks; tampering, though rare, is a real threat, especially in high-stakes environments.

Similarly, device compromise is easier than most realize. One common tactic is juice jacking, where malicious USB charging stations are used to install malware or steal data. Our recommendation is simple: Always use your own wall adapter and charging cable. If that means a quick trip back to your hotel room, it’s a small price to pay for keeping your digital assets safe.

# As crypto continues to grow and mature, our approach to security must remain uncompromising

The more visible and mainstream our industry becomes, the more attractive we are to bad actors, and the easier it is for complacency to undermine progress. It’s time to get back to basics. In today’s high-stakes environment, crypto complacency isn’t just a personal risk, it’s a threat to our broader movement.

-Much Clearer Skin

The nitty gritty: 
-I went pure waters(no tea/coffee etc) 
-The longest I had previously fasted was 5 days. 
-Days 1-6 were a breeze(relatively). From day 7 on, I really struggled keeping my electrolytes balanced. 
-I took my blood pressure 3 times a day and took additional electrolytes to address any issues (e.g high resting heart rate). I think the problem was more my discipline staying on top of drinking the electrolytes than anything else. 
-The BP measurements helped a TON though. 
-No serious headaches throughout the fast, though a good amount of fatigue during the second week.

I also walked 3-5 miles a day each day and did a good amount of lifting in my job. Lots of social events too, but never shared I was water fasting because I didn’t want the attention. I also moved apartments mid fast (including moving the bed, couch, etc), so fasting definitely doesn’t keep you from living life!

It’s Vacuum Wars here. We’ve seen a lot of questions and curiosity about the new **Mova P50 Pro Ultra**, especially since so many of you are familiar with our very favorable review of its cheaper sibling, the **P10 Pro Ultra**, which won our Best Value award.

We bought a P50 and have been putting it through its paces for the past few weeks. Our full video review will be on YouTube soon, but we wanted to give this community a detailed preview of our findings. The story is interesting: while the P50 has more features, the cheaper P10 might still be the better choice for many. Here’s the breakdown.

# TL;DR:

* **The P50's biggest advantage is mopping.** It's significantly better than the P10 on tough, dried-on stains, where the P10 was just average.
* **The P50 has more premium features on paper:** active hair removal, slightly hotter mop washing, camera-based dirt detection, and the option to detach mops at the base.
* **Surprisingly, the cheaper P10 beat the P50 in several key** ***vacuuming*** **tests**, including our carpet deep clean and crevice pickup tests. The P10 also had slightly better measured airflow and navigation/battery efficiency.
* **Conclusion:** The **P10 Pro Ultra** remains an incredible value and is likely the better buy for most people. The **P50 Pro Ultra** is still a great value compared to other flagships, and it's the clear choice if powerful mopping is your absolute top priority.

# The Full Breakdown

# Price & Basics

* **Mova P50 Pro Ultra:** Lists for $1,000, but we're seeing it sell for around **$800**.
* **Mova P10 Pro Ultra:** Typically sells in the **$500 - $600** range.
* Both are robot vacuum/mop combos priced significantly below competitors with similar feature sets.

# What’s New & Better on the P50 Pro Ultra?

These are the key upgrades the P50 brings to the table:

* **Better Mopping Performance:** This is the most significant improvement. In our dried-on stain test, the P50 scored an amazing **110**, well above average and a huge jump from the P10's adequate-but-unremarkable performance. It cleans thoroughly without leaving excess water.
* **Active Hair Removal:** The P50 has a system to actively remove hair from the brushroll. In our tests, it was about **4%** better at resisting tangles than the P10. Honestly, both were already significantly better than average here, so it's a minor improvement.
* **Mop Detaching:** While both robots lift their spinning mops by 10mm on carpet, the P50 adds the option to leave the mop pads at the base entirely for a vacuum-only run. This gives you 100% certainty your carpets will stay dry.
* **Camera-Based Dirt Detection:** A rare feature where the P50 uses its camera to identify heavily soiled spots and focus on them. We saw this work during our coffee debris test, where it intelligently spent extra time on the spill.
* **Hotter Mop Washing:** The P50 uses slightly hotter water than the P10 when self-cleaning its mop pads at the dock.

# What’s the Same on Both Models?

The P10 and P50 share an impressive core set of high-end features:

* **Advanced Dock:** Both have a fantastic, full-featured dock that:
   * Auto-empties the dustbin into a disposable bag.
   * Washes the mop pads with clean water.
   * Dries the mop pads with heated air.
   * Refills the robot's onboard water tank (with water and optional solution).
   * Features a dock self-cleaning function with squeegees.
* **Edge & Corner Cleaning Tech:** Both have an **auto-extending side brush** for corners and an **auto-extending rear mop head** for mopping right up to the edge of walls. Both features worked incredibly well in our tests.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** Both use a camera with 3D structured light for obstacle avoidance. Performance was very similar and slightly above average for the industry. The P10 actually scored marginally better in our tests, but we believe this is within the margin of error.
* **App & Software:** The app experience is identical and very robust for a new brand, featuring multi-level mapping, no-go zones, 3D maps, and even live video monitoring.

# Where the Cheaper P10 Surprisingly Won

Despite the P50 having a higher advertised suction power, our tests showed the P10 coming out ahead in several practical performance metrics:

* **Airflow & Suction:** Our own measurements showed the **P10 had slightly higher suction and airflow** than the P50.
* **Carpet Deep Clean Test:** The P10 was more effective at pulling sand out of deep carpet pile.
* **Crevice Pickup Test:** The P10 did a better job of pulling debris from a hard-floor crevice.
* **Efficiency:** The P10 was slightly more efficient with its navigation and battery usage, giving it a better estimated square footage cleaned per charge.

# Final Thoughts & Rankings

The **Mova P10 Pro Ultra** is a truly exceptional value. Its main weakness is its average mopping, which is precisely where the **P50 Pro Ultra** excels.

The P50 is by no means a bad robot—its features and mopping performance are unmatched at its \~$800 price point, making it a tremendous value in its own right. However, the fact that the cheaper P10 outperforms it on core vacuuming tasks like carpet cleaning is significant.

For most users, the P10 offers a more balanced performance package for an unbeatable price.

As of now, on the official[ Vacuum Wars Top 20 list:](https://vacuumwars.com/vacuum-wars-best-robot-vacuums/)

* The **Mova P10 Pro Ultra** ranks at **#9**.
* The **Mova P50 Pro Ultra** ranks at **#18**.

From Basketball Stardom to Boardroom Brilliance: Magic Johnson’s Winning Strategy

https://preview.redd.it/rc6jca4kki6f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8125a4faf557c7fc762a71c10cd0f9a9b720f12

Earvin “Magic” Johnson is a name synonymous with basketball brilliance, but his off-court game is just as legendary. In the latest episode of The Deal with Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly, recorded live at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, the NBA icon-turned-business mogul dished on the deals that transformed him from a court king to a boardroom titan. Spoiler alert: coffee and football play starring roles.

**From Layups to Lattes: The Starbucks Slam Dunk**

In 1998, Magic Johnson didn’t just score a franchise deal with Starbucks—he rewrote the playbook for urban investment. Convincing then-CEO Howard Schultz to let him bring the coffee giant to underserved communities was no small feat. But Johnson’s vision to build sustainable businesses in urban markets sealed the deal. “It gave the stamp of approval,” he told Rodriguez and Kelly, crediting the Starbucks partnership as the cornerstone of his business credibility.

This wasn’t just about slinging Frappuccinos. Johnson’s Starbucks franchises proved that urban markets were goldmines waiting to be tapped, paving the way for his ventures like the Magic Johnson Theatres chain. With a knack for spotting opportunity where others saw risk, he turned coffee shops into community hubs, proving that purpose and profit can coexist.

**The $6.05 Billion Touchdown with the Washington Commanders**

Fast-forward to 2023, and Johnson’s biggest play yet: joining Josh Harris’ ownership group to buy the Washington Commanders for a record-shattering $6.05 billion. Calling it “the greatest deal I’ve ever done,” Johnson says this move cemented his transition from athlete to executive. His stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers and Dodgers were impressive, but the Commanders deal was a whole new league.

What makes Magic’s role with the Commanders so compelling? It’s not just his deep pockets—it’s his deeper wisdom. Drawing on decades as a player and owner, he’s helping shape the franchise’s identity. “My job is to hold everybody accountable,” he says, ensuring the team knows “who we are and who we want to be.” That’s not just leadership; it’s legacy-building.

**The Magic Formula: Vision, Grit, and Accountability**

At 65, Johnson’s career is a masterclass in reinvention. His Starbucks deal showed he could disrupt industries. His Commanders stake proved he could dominate them. And his philosophy—rooted in accountability and identity—offers a blueprint for any former athlete eyeing the C-suite. “We can go from the court to the boardroom,” he declares, and his track record backs it up.

Johnson’s story isn’t just inspiring; it’s a case study in leveraging fame, vision, and hustle to build an empire. Whether it’s coffee, football, or movie theaters, Magic’s magic touch lies in seeing potential where others don’t—and executing flawlessly.

I have been doing dirty OMAD with some success. I usually have 1-2 cups of coffee with milk, and maybe an apple or boiled eggs or yogurt to hold me over until dinner time. I was looking at milk nutritional ingredients and shocked to see 1cup has around 13 grams of sugar! Now I’m not drinking 1cup of milk every morning but it’s sugar nonetheless. I decided to try Almond milk & Soy Milk alternatives for their much lower sugar content. Total game changer. My mid afternoon sugar/food cravings are totally crushed. It’s way easier to ignore hunger. 
I really underestimated what that little milk sugar spike was doing to my cravings.

Anyways. I was super hesitant to Soymilk & Almond milk because I try to avoid processed foods as much as possible, but until I reach my goal weight I think I’m ok with this swap. In the end I crave way less junk food and can stay on track easier, so I consider this a trade up for now.

Unfiltered coffee releases more of these compounds, which can raise LDL cholesterol.

I know the Keurig pods themselves supposedly have a paper filter in them to try to filter some of this out, but there is nothing paper in that Universal reusable refillable pod, but there is a metal mesh cage filter.

So, what to do, if you want to paper filter the coffee somewhat?  Stick a paper filter over the coffee cup?

Using my new Keurig K-Café SMART Single Serve Coffee Maker with freshly ground beans, that multistream technology actually makes a great cup of coffee, but what about the cholesterol?  I don't drink a lot of coffee so I don't want to brew a whole pot.

1l9p3uc,https://i.redd.it/1wfne6qsji6f1.jpeg,Totally Donculus ep.26,"With the rules in place the dare gauntlet begins. Dwayne spins the wheel and it lands on Rock. His dare is to eat three raw eggs and do 20 jumping jacks. It’s unorthodox but doable. Dwayne powers through and earns a freebie. Ellody gets a dare from Emma. Call one of your final three competitors your best friend and mean it. Don blinks, not all of them are winners. Ellody also blinks. She earns an easy freebie after admitting to Dwayne what a good friend he is. Ennui gets a dare from Crimson. Watch a rainbow unicorn music video on loop and dance along with enthusiasm. He deadpans, and chuckles darkly. To love is to do challenging things for one another. He does it… he actually does it and earns a freebie. Tammy gets a dare from Geoff. Put on a cheer uniform and make a cheer routine for Chef. It’s awkward to cheer for Chef out of the blue but Tammy does it anyways. She gets herself a freebie too. Don looks at everyone and their one freebie. This might be harder to get them to quit than they thought.

The final four are spun through the ringer, dare after dare. Drink hot sauce out of a boot, Hold a tarantula while reciting a love poem to it, Let Chef paint your face blindfolded, Reveal your most embarrassing secret on camera, Eat a bowl of sugarless bran flakes without milk, Let Don read something embarrassing off your application form, Swim in a kiddie pool filled with sardine juice, drink a litter of soda and burp the alphabet as far as you can, Salsa dance while drenched in salsa, Give yourself a swirlie, Tickle a bear, Drink a smoothie of Chef’s mystery meat. As rounds pass, Ennui proves to be untouchable. Every dare, he takes head-on, emotionally unaffected and calmly accumulating a mountain of freebies. He doesn’t let anyone take the dares he’s given. It’s insane. Dwayne takes a few strategic freebies, managing to cling to three freebies like shields. Ellody and Tammy trade a few dares back and forth. They’re straining now, clearly scraping the bottom of their mental endurance, the two girls are the weakest links, burning each other's freebies. They look to the guys. Ennui looks down solemnly. This is their fight to endure. Dwayne looks like he’s about to crack and give one to Ellody but Ennui places a hand on Dwayne’s shoulder. “Let them duel with honor.” Dwayne sighs. Ennui is right, would they do the same if it was him on the verge of going home? With no free handouts the two girls continue to fight. Suddenly, it lands on Chet’s dare “Say the most vile, horrible thing you truly believe about your original partner. Hooked to a lie detector.” Ellody freezes. Her breath catches. She has no freebies. She can’t say something cruel about Mary, not truthfully anyways. Ellody has no choice. She passes it to Tammy.

Chef straps her into the lie detector.
The camera zooms in. The room is silent. Don speaks calmly. “Alright Tammy. Time to spill some venom. One horrible truth about Leonard. Let’s hear it.” There is a long pause. Tammy’s voice trembles as she speaks. “I… I can’t.
Leonard might believe in spells and dragons and witches, perhaps a little too much. But he was my only friend growing up. He listened to me when no one else did. He made me laugh when I felt invisible. Many people think he’s a joke, but he’s not a joke… not to me. He’s the kindest person I know. That’s more real than anything he thinks. Sure, he’s wacky and a little out there… but I won’t betray that just to win. I love Leonard just the way he is.” BUZZ. The machine spikes. It’s true. Don looks to the camera, he’s wiping his eyes, it pains him to do this. “And with that… Tammy is… Tammy is out of the game.” Chef gently unhooks her. The others sit in stunned silence. Tammy wipes her eyes, then gives a brave nod. Ellody sniffles and apologizes. “Tammy, I am so sorry. It was not a dare I could have done either.” Tammy understands the name of the game. She shakes Ellody’s hand, no hard feelings. Next is Dwayne. “I would have quit on the spot. No one could ever get me to say something bad about my kid.” Tammy laughs sadly and hugs Dwayne, then her newest made friend, Ennui. Ennui gives her a small smile. “Even in the depths of my blackened soul I could never speak ill of my darkest temptation. You spoke with truth and conviction, even when it meant you lost it all… You have my eternal respect.” The two give each other a knowing smile. She finishes her walk to the boat of losers. She waves goodbye. Shouting good luck to all of them. They watch till she’s out of sight. 

Don is wiping his eyes still. “Then there were three. Ultimate dad of the year Dwayne! Genius with a heart of gold Ellody! And the light in the darkness Ennui! Congratulations. Your next challenge is the last one. A three way finale where one of you will finally be crowned the winner of Totally Donculus Island. Go get some rest. You’re gonna need it.” The final three say their goodnights and head to bed. All of them a mix of nervous and excited.

The next day the sky is clear, the lake is still, and the dining hall smells incredible. It’s Chef using all his culinary power. He rewards the final three with a feast worthy of champions. The table is overflowing with everything. Golden waffles with syrup drizzling off the sides, fluffy scrambled eggs, maple-glazed bacon, sausage links, flaky croissants still warm from the oven, stacks of pancakes dusted with powdered sugar, crispy hashbrowns, buttery toast, warm grits with a swirl of cheese, fresh fruit, and even tiny fancy cereal boxes for flair. They’re all stunned, then they all feast.

—-> Dwayne: He is chomping on a sausage link, eyes a little glassy. “Y’know… when I came here, I figured I’d be voted off early. Just an old man way over his head. But I made it to the final three. I’m just a regular guy, dad of one, strict but loving wife… I had no crazy strategy, but somehow, being kind worked. Now win or lose… I think my kid is gonna be really dang proud of their old man.”

—-> Ellody: She’s biting into a strip of bacon. “Statistically, I shouldn’t be here. Not with this many social and physical threats around me. But I didn’t rely on chance. I relied on data, reasoning, and intuition… at first. Then I threw it all  away to trust in people and actions. I made friends. I made moves. I stayed true to who I was… yet also changed for the better. No matter how uncomfortable as that was sometimes. Now it’s just one final challenge. One more test. And I intend to pass with flying colors just like I always do.”

—-> Ennui: He is staring into his black coffee, thanks to Tammy’s supplies he is back to him old self, though under the makeup is a new, improved Ennui. “I didn’t expect to make it far. I figured I’d fade into the background, maybe have others question if I was ever even there before becoming forgotten. But… some people saw me… heard me… and I saw and heard them in return. Even when things reached their abyss Tammy showed me I was still me. I am Ennui, mask on or off. When me and Crimson were in our earliest stages of dating she told me: “When you find people who don’t try to fix your darkness… keep them.” I did. I did when I met Crimson. I did when I came together with the last survivors, and I did when Tammy reached out. I found those people here.
But now it’s just me. And I plan to win this thing… for all the dark souls in the world that were deemed too weird for the world of the light.” Loki raises a carrot like a flag seems Chef even thought of Loki. Now that’s dedication.

Dwayne raises his orange juice. “Win or lose, you two… it’s been real. We survived everything this show threw at us!” Ellody giggles and chimes in, raising a cup of tea. “We were competitors. We were survivors. We were even enemies sometimes… and now… we’re equals.” Ennui raises a glass of black coffee to join their cups. “The dawn of our final day. Let’s make it count.” They clink glasses. Juice, black coffee, and herbal tea. Completely different yet all together just like them. Then they eat like it’s their last meal… cause… it is.

A half hour later, Don’s voice crackles through the intercom. The final three are to report outside to the trails. It’s time. They rise. Full stomachs, heavy hearts, and eyes fixed forward. Whatever happens next… it was life changing for all of them.

A little more about us: 
One male and one female and both are in early 30’s. We are transplants from the Midwest and east coast and have lived at the house since it was built in 2020! We all have our own lives but once in a blue moon we will do something together i.e. grab a bite to eat, concerts, pickleball, movies, holiday celebrations, etc. One works from home (finance) and likes cooking, yoga, meditation, researching restaurants, and playing guitar. The other is hybrid (supply chain at a gaming company) and likes motorcycling, going to the gym, pickleball, and comedy shows. Shared interests include anime, gaming, coffee, and rock music! Occasionally someone might vape. In terms of alcohol, we rarely drink by ourselves but in social situations we may partake. One of the housemates burns incense in their room twice a day and opens all the windows (other housemates have said they can hardly smell it). If I had to describe our vibe it would be down-to-earth, straightforward, and docile. We are hoping we can find someone that shares these sensibilities with us 😂

A little more about what we are looking for:
Ideally we’d like someone that is low maintenance, positive vibes, steady job, clean, tidy, respectful, responsible, and no drama! Since we are in our 30’s now we will have people over but we’re not looking to party all the time 👵🏽😂 As for pets, we are leaning towards no pets, but for someone that’s cool we can open the conversation for ONE CAT 🐈 provided that person can give the attention and care the cat requires. The house is month-to-month but ideally we’d want our new housemate to stay for at least two years so we don’t have to keep going through this process all the time 😎

Rent is $1369 per month (month-to-month) + utilities. Security deposit is $1319.

For the person that ends up moving in, they will apply through the real estate agency, name will go on the lease, work out the security deposit with the housemate that moved out, then they’ll be good to move in!

If interested or any questions message me. Thanks for reading 🙏

J.M. Smucker is a packaged food company that primarily sells through the US retail channel (78% of fiscal 2024 revenue came through its retail pet foods, coffee, and frozen handheld/spreads segments), with the remaining share consisting of Hostess and international (primarily Canada). Retail coffee is its largest category (33% of sales) with brands Folgers and Dunkin'. Pet foods (22% of sales) holds leading brands like Milk-Bone and Meow Mix. Of its remaining, approximately 22% comes from consumer foods, primarily peanut butter and jelly, through brands Jif and Smucker's. The company acquired Hostess Brands in fiscal 2024 to boost its snack and convenience store presence.

The stock is looking like good value based on median 10-year price ratio's.  Dividend of 4.5% is quite nice.

i was in the car with my mom when i asked her how i can get cocoa powder to break up easier when i put it in water, since it’s hydrophobic and my wrist hurts by the time i get it mixed in. she said she has a blender so i can make the coffee in that, and she’d show me how to use it when we get home.

we get home at 3:30 and i ask her if she can show me. she says “in a minute” so i wait patiently. for the next half hour. i walk in on her in the living room on the phone with my dad. she hangs up and she KNOWS what i want. that’s when she decides im not allowed to make it because she’s heading out for an hour and making dinner when we come back. when i said “why didn’t you tell me that in the car” she says that she never said she’d let me make it, just that she’d show me.

i feel so confused and kinda upset. was i being stupid for interpreting “i’ll show you” as “i’ll help you make it”??? would any of you interpret it that way too???",2,1749741209.0,autism,1,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**  


The pitching matchup here is just far too one-sided not to roll with the Mets. I know it’s tough to pull off the sweep, but New York has every advantage coming into this game – the better offense, the far better starting pitcher, and home base as the venue. To boot, the Nationals have only won 2 of their last 10 games against New York. With all but 1 of starter Kodai Senga’s (1.59 ERA) wins this season having been by at least 2 runs, my money’s on the Mets to complete the sweep and cover the RL.

We’ve got loads in common, similar interests, same degree, same vibe, I’ve always found her really attractive.

We’ve reconnected recently through work, and I found out she’s newly single. The issue is… I don’t think she sees me that way. Instead, she seems to be nudging me towards her best friend, who I matched with on a dating app months ago.

Her friend is lovely, and we went for a casual coffee recently, nothing romantic… just friendly. But now I feel like her best friend might be interested, and I’m not. And to make it more complicated, the girl I like is now asking me what I think of her friend.

Honestly, it’s stressing me out. I don’t want to lead anyone on, but I also don’t want to make things awkward at work or at upcoming social events where we’ll all be there.

Anyone ever been in something like this? What do you do when you like one person but their best friend likes you? 

Not sure whether to be honest with the girl that l like and just tell her I’ve always liked her, or let it fizzle out, or just move on entirely. Anyone been through something similar?

I researched OMAD figured I’d give it a try no diet in the past ever worked. The hunger was rough considering I work 12 hour shifts with an amazing cafeteria at my workplace. I choose dinner to be my meal for the day considering my wife primarily cooks and I didn’t want to neglect her efforts when it comes to providing for my family.

I’m also a High functioning alcoholic so this provided some difficulty when it comes to losing weight so I would modify my OMAD to a 20:4 fast I would consume calories from 6pm - 10pm so I could still drink.

For the first month I’d drink black coffee around 9:30 am to fight off hunger then I was going until noon and eventually no coffee/caffeine at all and that absolutely blew my mind!

A few guys just seemed like regular guys with jobs who were married looking for friends, and even had pictures of themselves with their wives/kids in their profiles. I weightlift as well so I matched up with a few other fellow single guys who worked out, and said they were straight in their profile. As you may have already figured by where this post was headed, none of these guys seemed very straight and the experiences were just bizarre.

At the very least, the guys with wives were basically just looking to entertain the fantasy of having another guy have sex with their wives but also heavily alluded to wanting to do stuff with other guys. One guy sent me pictures of he and his wife having sex unsolicited, and from the sounds of it, I don't think she realized he was perving her out to strangers online. He also said he and his buddy were both giving each other ""bro jobs"" before they each got married. It's honestly angering, because the wives will be beautiful women and then you throw in the fact they've got a kid, and here I am, cursing Bumble's dating side and barely getting lame coffee dates for all the intentional effort put in, and these guys just take it all for granted and are good at hiding being massive creeps.

The weightlifter guys all seemed like dudes confused about their sexualities and trying to use the ruse of looking for new friends and experiment with other guys. One guy talked a lot about what he did for work, and seemed smart and pretty grounded. He was telling me how he's dodged guys on the app who he thought were looking for dates, so I felt he was running into similar experiences as myself. He asked if I'd be up to do a video chat since we lived about 40 minutes apart, and I said sure. He calls me though right as he gets home from the gym, which I thought was weird because there was no rush on my end. Go ahead and settle in, you know? But we begin our video chat, and after some small talk, he starts saying how sweaty he is from the gym, and begins removing his shirt, his shorts.

Next thing I know, he's standing there fully erect, and I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay this is fucked up but let's see how this dude tries to spin this..."" and he begins talking about how he always wanted a ""bromance"" with another muscular guy, and begins asking me questions like, ""Are you cut or uncut?"" and ""Are you a dry jacker?"" and whether I shoot or ""ooze"". Friends, these are not terms regularly used within the hetero vernacular lol Bro may have fronted like he was straight, but he was at the very least heavily bi, which is totally fine, but also, don't lure guys in under the pretense of wanting to make new friends and then bombard them with your big black dick over a video chat.

Ended that call before dude could ""ooze"" and unmatched, then went right back to dating mode where things are also a dumpster fire, but at least I'm not dealing with as many cuckold fantasies (because those unfortunately exist on dating mode lol) and surprise video call dongs.",9,1749740293.0,Bumble,10,0.91,False

New content and fixing some issues,"[maxchill has created a new location once again. This one is probably familiar to a lot of you!](https://preview.redd.it/by7xhuf1di6f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4420410f65790ea898c111abc83a5abf72d7c2cb)

Hello, and welcome to another WalkScape development blog! This time, we're releasing another content update, while also introducing some fixes to issues people have been having - hopefully fixing some of them now for good! This devblog will be a shorter one than usually, focusing mainly on the new update.



# maxchill's comment on the new content update

Hello, dear walkers, a word from maxchill here on intentions behind the changes Adventurers Guild Shop items, AG Chests, and Skill Chests. Let's start with AG shop items - Bert's Super-Skis and Seth's Swamp Compass. Their price has been reduced to 750 AG tokens, and their rarity dropped to Epic. We realised our oversight with their pricing upon adding them, and due to their regional nature decided to reduce their price significantly and also change the rarity. Amongst the changes we also added a price reduction to Cape of the Trailblazer to make it more accessible to low-medium steppers.

The loot of AG chest has been updated by adding gathering/agility skill memospheres and several useful consumables. They've been added to the coal/scrap loot section, so the new items shouldn't change the chances of getting the rare/epic gear items that many are after. Mainly the change is done to eliminate the coal/scrap only chests (they might still very rarely pop up) and make acquiring them a less frustrating experience.

Changes to Skill chests include two things. The minor one is that drop rates of memospheres has been increased and the chests now have chance to drop trinkets which are used for crafting amulets with Trinketry skill. The memosphere drop rate increase hopefully will make people get full stacks of them more reliably and able to consume them in larger quanitities for more satisfiying exp boost.

Intention of adding trinkets to skill chests is something that should be appealing to both new and experienced players. They will now serve as motivation to open chest stacks for those who have all the desired items from skill chests, and for new players it might become a new goal of crafting an amulet from their newfound trinket. Even when not farming trinkets directly, you will now be able to get few trinkets now and then from chests and interact with Trinketry amulet crafting which is quite exciting experience.

Also wanted to mention that finally we have added an item that's been submitted by one of our cult supporters to the game. Not going to tell you anything more, but we are dedicated to start adding the submitted items more regularly moving forward.

Now I'm drinking water and running into similar symptoms but no where near as dramatic and I'm certain I'm not allergic to water so could this all be GERD causing acid reflux which is causing the swelling and tightness. Wouldn't expect benadryl to work if it was.

Lately we had the chance to review more than 20 moka pots in all shapes, sizes, and price ranges. So we figured it’s a good time to share what we found and help anyone here who’s thinking of getting one.

We do product research and reviews over at Requiremints, just trying to help folks choose the right stuff without overthinking it.

Before picking a moka pot...

* **Material**: Aluminum heats faster; stainless steel lasts longer and works on induction.
* **Stovetop compatibility**: Not all moka pots work on induction stoves.
* **Cup size**: A “cup” is usually a small espresso shot, not a full mug :)))
* **Ease of cleaning**: Most shouldn’t go in the dishwasher.
* **Handle and safety**: Look for heat-resistant handles and a safety valve.

Here are some of our favorite moka pots:

* **\[Best for Large-Batch\] Bialetti Moka Express - 12 Cups** \- Aluminum stovetop pot that brews up to 12 cups. Simple to use, with a safety valve and ergonomic handle. Works on most stoves with adapter.
* **\[Best for Durability\] Bialetti Venus - 6 Cups** \- Stainless steel build for long-term use. Compatible with induction and standard stovetops. Makes 6 cups. Avoid dishwasher and detergents. Designed with a minimalist, modern look.
* **\[Best for Budget\] Primula Classic Stovetop Espresso - 6 Cups** \- Cast aluminum moka pot for everyday brewing. Makes 6 cups of coffee. Lightweight, basic design. Works on most stoves. Clean with warm water only.
* **\[Best for Value\] Grosche Milano - 12 Cups** \- Large-capacity aluminum moka pot with silicone gasket and safety valve. Compatible with most stovetops. Slow on induction. Designed for making basic espresso-style coffee at home.
* **\[Best for Mid-Size\] Bialetti Moka Express - 9 Cups** \- Mid-size version of the classic moka pot. Simple setup: fill, close, heat. Makes up to 9 cups. Avoid detergents. Iconic octagonal shape, made in Italy.
* **\[Best for Safety\] Grosche Milano - 9 Cups** \- Stovetop espresso maker with soft-touch handle and burn guard. Aluminum body, silicone gasket. Compatible with most stoves. Clean with water. Slower on induction burners.

Hopefully one of these can do the job for you.

If you’re curious to explore more options or want to compare different sizes and brands, you can see the research on our site, [see this page of best moka pots](https://requiremints.com/guide/best-moka-pots/). It includes over 40 top-seller options and you can use the filter to find the exact one you need.

⭐️Cut the grass-inside AND outside the fence *AND got the mower recharging which I usually forget to do until it’s time to put it away, so EXTRA STARS ON THAT*
⭐️ cleaned the kitchen, loaded the dishwasher & started it, did the “by hand” dishes and wiped the counters. 
⭐️swept the floors - they are already a little dirty again but remember we still get the stars even if the dogs fuck up our work immediately after we do it. 
⭐️folded and put away laundry and started the washer 

Here’s a tip kids when you have multiple loads of laundry to do, do the “fast and easy” ones first so by the time you’re tired of it, the last load ends on the time consuming stuff: socks/underwear so you can leave those in the dryer if you’re spent and not have to get them out in order to not leave a smelly load in the washer.

She has small bowel cancer that is also in her liver, ovaries and appendix. 

I think I’m a very black and white thinker and while I know no one can give me an exact time line of how long we have left with her, I do feel a bit confused and seem to be getting different answers from different sources. 

When looking at MacMillan’s “the last few weeks of life” article mum has all these symptoms bar the breathlessness although she would be breathless doing activities like climbing stairs. But she can still dress herself, and do light activities like going out for a coffee even though she would be extremely fatigued after and would sleep most of the day. 

But some videos I’ve watched from hospice nurses online explain that in the last few weeks patients may be bed bound, needing help with going to the toilet/ getting dressed. And this doesn’t describe my mum atm at all. 

So I’m just left a bit confused because her symptoms atm do seem really worrying, her ascites is really uncomfortable for her and she looks pregnant with it, she has a build up of fluid around her legs and ankles, she’s pretty much in constant pain and on 2 types of morphine and an anti sickness tablet, I come round every day to help with household chores and walk her dog, and more recently she’s been saying that she’s been getting mouth sores. And she struggles to eat unless she takes her anti sickness tablets. 

So yea I’m just feeling a bit confused with it all and I’m unsure if we as a family should be preparing for our last few weeks or if we have a bit more time. As mentioned above I know no one can give me an exact answer but I think hearing some other opinions/ experiences may help me understand what stage we’re at. 

Thanks.

1l9o2gi,http://o2stamina.com,"I couldn’t breathe through my nose while running, so I made something that actually works","Didn’t plan on starting a company. I just wanted to breathe properly while running.

Every trail run over 10k, same story: legs were fine, lungs were fine, but I’d start falling apart. Mouth dry, breathing all over the place, brain fog creeping in. It wasn’t endurance, it was bad breathing.

I tried nasal breathing. Apparently it’s better for oxygen efficiency, focus, all that. But I couldn’t do it. My nose felt blocked, like trying to suck air through a coffee stirrer. I’d give up and go back to mouth breathing.

Tried taping my mouth shut. Tried those snore strips from the pharmacy. Helped a little, but they were clearly made for sleeping, not sweating through a 15k trail in wind and rain.

At some point, I just got fed up. I couldn’t stop thinking, why doesn’t anyone make nasal strips for runners? Something that stays on, opens the nose properly, and holds up when you’re actually moving.

So I decided to make one myself.

I started messing with prototypes: different shapes, adhesives, materials. It was brutal. I burned through so many versions I lost count. Some wouldn’t stick. Others stuck too hard and tore skin. One batch literally melted off when a tester ran in heat. Had people testing them in races, mountains, rain, everything. Constant feedback. Constant failure.

Eventually, we got it right.

Now I can finally breathe through my nose on long runs. No dry mouth. No gasping. It just feels clean. Like my face unlocked. And I’m not alone, every serious runner we gave it to said the same thing. You feel it on the first breath.

We called it O2Stamina. It’s made in the Netherlands, designed only for athletes. No gimmicks, just a strip that works.

Not here to push anything. Just proud we made something real.

She historically had issues with low self esteem. Recently..... within just a span of about 2 months, she dropped a LOT of weight on Ozempic. Weird comments started to come from her:

She told me she has a fantasy of watching her have sex with another man (not for me!)
She told me her co-worker masturbates to her. (Totally inappropriate, why was he so comfortable telling her this... what reaction was she looking to get out of me?)
I am in the military. She recently said ""Hey, you should get a hall-pass when you deploy.... you are coming home to me anyway"".
She said guys are starting to buy her coffee in the morning on way to work
I was away on a trip. She is usually never out late. Well she came home at 1:30 AM (saw it on the Ring/Blink). I went to text her about it later that morning but I found she deleted the footage. When I texted her about the weird comments and now the deleted footage, she became super apologetic. She stated she recognizes it seems sketchy but she has gained more confidence and more attention from other men lately and that they are just fantasies.
I shut down on the trip I didn't talk to her. When I came home, she was completely unemotional and said she wants a divorce, she loves but no longer in love with me, and that's it.

She told me she has been unhappy for about a year. I look back on my actions and I did slip into routine. I didn't keep the spark up. I believe now, with her new self-confidence with the weight loss and possibly some outside validation that came with it, she was done with me being caught up in routine. Looking back she threw subtle signs at me but I just didn't *really* recognize it. She told me those weird comments from the beginning of this post was her crazy way of a last wake-up call from me to recognize her.

I’m glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn’t get here by themselves. It’s been a long road and it’s taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they’re like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now. And they sound like they’ve been on the hard ground.

I should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I’m eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists.

Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that’s all that mattered. I can’t thank him enough for that. Lou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn’t stay there too long.

Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like “Stardust,” he’d turn it down because it would be too late.

He told me that if I was before my time — and he didn’t really know that for sure — but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up — so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn’t judge me, and I’ll always remember him for that.

Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I’d give him next. I didn’t even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I’ll always be grateful for him also for that attitude.

I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I’ve got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn’t even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn’t have happened to, or with, a better group.

They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it — they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don’t think that would have happened if it wasn’t for them. They definitely started something for me.

The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher — they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn’t a pop songwriter and I really didn’t want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didn’t really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they’d done it.

Purvis Staples and the Staple Singers — long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in ’62 or ’63. They heard my songs live and Purvis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs.

Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she [inaudible] to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about.

Oh, and can’t forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames — something like that. And Jimi didn’t even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here.

Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about ’63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. “Big River,” “I Walk the Line.”

“How high’s the water, Mama?” I wrote “It’s Alright Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, “How high is the water, mama?” Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing.

In Johnny Cash’s world — hardcore Southern drama — that kind of thing didn’t exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn’t do that kind of thing. I’m always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I’ll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days.

Oh, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice.

People would say, “What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?” And she’d tell everybody in no uncertain terms, “Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs.” We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And she’s a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn’t want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back.

These songs didn’t come out of thin air. I didn’t just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock ‘n’ roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music.

I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that’s fair game, that everything belongs to everyone.

For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if I’d heard it just once.

If you sang “John Henry” as many times as me — “John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain’t nothin’ but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I’ll die with that hammer in my hand.”

If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you’d have written “How many roads must a man walk down?” too.

Big Bill Broonzy had a song called “Key to the Highway.” “I’ve got a key to the highway / I’m booked and I’m bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin’ because walking is most too slow.” I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write,

Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard said there’s only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to run Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61

You’d have written that too if you’d sang “Key to the Highway” as much as me.

“Ain’t no use sit ‘n cry / You’ll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away.” “I’m sailing away my own true love.” “Boots of Spanish Leather” — Sheryl Crow just sung that.

“Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man’s pay / A dollar a day is the black man’s pay / Roll the cotton down.” If you sang that song as many times as me, you’d be writing “I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more,” too.

I sang a lot of “come all you” songs. There’s plenty of them. There’s way too many to be counted. “Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail.” Or, “Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.”

“Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They’re like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they’re gone again.” “If you’ll gather ’round, people / A story I will tell / ‘Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.”

If you sung all these “come all ye” songs all the time, you’d be writing, “Come gather ’round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you’ll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you’ll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing.”

You’d have written them too. There’s nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that’s all enough, and that’s all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense.

“When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks.” Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, “When you’re lost in the rain in Juarez and it’s Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don’t pull you through / Don’t put on any airs / When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.”

All these songs are connected. Don’t be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It’s just different, saying the same thing. I didn’t think it was anything out of the ordinary.

Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn’t know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway.

Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn’t think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. You’ve just got to bear it. I didn’t really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs.

They didn’t like ‘em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn’t like ‘em, because I never liked their songs either. “Yakety yak, don’t talk back.” “Charlie Brown is a clown,” “Baby I’m a hog for you.” Novelty songs. They weren’t saying anything serious. Doc’s songs, they were better. “This Magic Moment.” “Lonely Avenue.” Save the Last Dance for Me.

Those songs broke my heart. I figured I’d rather have his blessings any day than theirs.

Ahmet Ertegun didn’t think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few.

There were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I’d rather have Sam Phillips’ blessing any day.

Merle Haggard didn’t even think much of my songs. I know he didn’t. He didn’t say that to me, but I know [inaudible]. Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard — “Mama Tried,” “The Bottle Let Me Down,” “I’m a Lonesome Fugitive.” I can’t imagine Waylon Jennings singing “The Bottle Let Me Down.”

“Together Again”? That’s Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody’s blessing — you figure it out.

Oh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I can’t sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don’t critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What don’t they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can’t carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I’ve never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?

What have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? When’s the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don’t you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction. [Inaudible] doesn’t even matter.

“Why me, Lord?” I would say that to myself.

Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving.

After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note — that exists, and some that don’t exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny.

Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don’t really think I do that. I just think critics say I do.

Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, “Well that’s very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth.” Think about that the next time you [inaudible].

Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that’s coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn’t understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about.

Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called “Country Road.” Tom was going off in this interview — “But James don’t say nothing about a country road. He’s just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don’t understand that.”

Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I’m not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio.

It was called “I Love.” I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he’s just like you and you’re just like him. We all love the same things, and we’re all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow- moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions.

Now listen, I’m not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I’m not going to do that. I’m not saying it’s a bad song. I’m just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing.

This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He’s still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until — until — Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain’t seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cash’s backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. “Sunday Morning Coming Down.”

Well, I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head that didn’t hurt. And the beer I had for breakfast wasn’t bad So I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet Found my cleanest dirty shirt Then I washed my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Hall’s poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs.

You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked You say, “Who is that man?” You try so hard But you don’t understand Just what you’re gonna say When you get home You know something is happening here But you don’t know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?

If “Sunday Morning Coming Down” rattled Tom’s cage, sent him into the looney bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the minivan. Hopefully he didn’t hear it.

I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson’s done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done ‘em. But the reviews of their records are different than the reviews of my record.

In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, [inaudible] they’ve got to look under every stone when it comes to me. They’ve got to mention all the songwriters’ names. Well that’s OK with me. After all, they’re great songwriters and these are standards. I’ve seen the reviews come in, and they’ll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody’s heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few.

But, you know, I’m glad they mention their names, and you know what? I’m glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they’re finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they’re not here to see it.

Traditional rock ‘n’ roll, we’re talking about that. It’s all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: “Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues.” Very few rock ‘n’ roll bands today play with rhythm. They don’t know what it is. Rock ‘n’ roll is a combination of blues, and it’s a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don’t know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It’s a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it’s true.

The other half of rock ‘n’ roll has got to be hillbilly. And that’s a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That’s a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley … groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That’s the kind of combination that makes up rock ‘n’ roll, and it can’t be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio.

You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can’t hardly play the blues, how do you [inaudible] those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you can’t really do it.

Critics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because that’s all I do. That’s how I think about it. Confounding expectations.

“What do you do for a living, man?” “Oh, I confound expectations.”

You’re going to get a job, the man says, “What do you do?” “Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, “Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don’t call us, we’ll call you.” Confounding expectations. What does that mean? ‘Why me, Lord? I’d confound them, but I don’t know how to do it.’

The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn’t. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don’t think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I’m thinking about singing is “Stand By Me” by the Blackwood Brothers. Not “Stand By Me” the pop song. No. The real “Stand By Me.” The real one goes like this:

When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me

In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me

In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don’t understand / Thou who knowest all about me / Stand by me

That’s the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that’s going to be the one. I’m also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: “Oh Lord, Please Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood.”

Anyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?

Anyway, I’m proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I’m honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There’s nothing like that. Great artists. [applause, inaudible]. They’re all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices.

I’m proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They’ve helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I’d like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn’t work. Billy was a son of rock ‘n’ roll, obviously.

He was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don’t stand a chance.

So Billy became what is known in the industry — a condescending term, by the way — as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who’s got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy’s hit song was called “Red Hot,” and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life.

He did it with style and grace. You won’t find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He’s not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas — I know they’re in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan — I’ve got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet.

I’d see him a couple times a year and we’d always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we’d cross paths now and again. We’d always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I’d heard “Red Hot.” I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it’s impressed me to this day.

I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn’t bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was.

And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing — because John sang some truth today — one day you get sick and you don’t get better. That’s from a song of his called “Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days.” It’s one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain’t lying.

And I ain’t lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend’s doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can’t be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing.

I’m going to get out of here now. I’m going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that’s OK. Like the spiritual song, ‘I’m still just crossing over Jordan too.’ Let’s hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams said, “the good Lord willing and the creek don’t rise.”",11,1749738660.0,bobdylan,8,0.87,False
1l9ny9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l9ny9n/the_friend_i_thought_i_had_made_on_halloween/,The Friend I Thought I Had Made on Halloween,"This happened when I was 9 years old.

It was Halloween, and I was always the kind of kid who made friends easily, loved talking, and running with others until I ran out of breath.

That night, we were at the little square near my house. My friends went home early, but I decided to stay a little longer. I like that time of day, when the sky turns orange and everything seems calm before it gets dark.

I sat on the swing and stayed there, watching the sunset, thinking about the route I’d take later to get candy. I could hardly wait to wear my new costume and eat everything I saw.

That’s when I felt someone poking me.

It was a small boy, probably no older than seven. He smiled and asked if I could push him on the swing. I agreed, of course — at that age, I’d make friends with anyone.

His name was Otto.

He seemed like an ordinary child. Very cheerful and full of energy, just like kids can be. He was dressed as a pirate, but the costume looked old, a bit torn. I thought it was odd, but I didn’t mind. At that age, it didn’t matter.

We talked for a while. He told me about the pirate costume he was wearing, and I talked about mine, which I was going to put on later before heading out for candy. We even made a bet to see who could get more that Halloween. It was easy to make friends at that age. You would just say your names and suddenly you were best friends.

Time passed faster than I realized. Before I knew it, it was getting dark, and the orange sky had been replaced by a deep blue. I kept pushing Otto on the swing, and we laughed, trying to see if we could get enough momentum to fly.

That’s when a group of other kids showed up. They wanted to use the swing. They asked me to get off, but I told them Otto and I were still playing.

Their reaction was strange. They looked at me, confused, as if I had said something that didn’t make sense. I didn’t understand. Not at that moment.

But Otto asked me to stop. He jumped off the swing, smiled, and said we should go somewhere else.

“It’s getting dark,” he said.

I told him I needed to go home to put on my new costume. He seemed excited about that and said he wanted to see it.

I didn’t think much about it. As kids, we don’t think much. Things just happen, and we accept them.

We walked together toward my house. The streets were already full of kids running in every direction, wearing colorful costumes and plastic masks. The orange and purple lights flickered in the windows, and the sound of “trick or treat!” echoed from time to time, mixed with laughter and hurried footsteps.

Otto and I, who now seemed like friends of years, watched all of that with the excitement of knowing the best part of the night was still to come.

When we got to my house, I told him to start trick-or-treating at the neighboring houses while I took a shower and put on my costume. He smiled and said okay, waiting for me to go in before continuing.

As soon as I entered, the sweet, strong smell of caramel filled the house.

My mom always made caramel apples at this time of year.

She appeared in the kitchen, a dish towel thrown over her shoulder, her cheeks rosy from the heat.

“Oh, before I forget,” she said, pointing to the corner of the room, “I’ve set aside some old things to donate. Take a look later and see if you want anything.”

I nodded, more focused on the caramel apples, but before going to take a shower, I glanced at the cardboard box.

It was one of those big supermarket boxes, full of old toys, action figures with missing arms, scratched cars, and some clothes I didn’t even remember existed.

I shuffled through the top of the box, just to say I’d looked.

That’s when I saw it.

At the bottom of the box, half-hidden under a dinosaur mask, was the little gray cloth mouse.

It belonged to Polaco.

My cat.

He carried that toy everywhere, and I always ended up tripping over it in the house. It had been years since he’d disappeared.

My mom used to say that sometimes cats run away and never come back.

But I… liked to think he might show up one day, meowing at the door.

I held the mouse for a moment, remembering the way Polaco would curl up with it to sleep.

It wasn’t a sad memory. Just… a good one that came out of nowhere.

I put the toy aside, grabbed an apple from the bucket, and went upstairs to shower.

I lost track of time in the shower, only realized it when my mom yelled, asking if I had drowned in the bathroom.

In my room, I looked at myself in the mirror, and in my head, I heard the imaginary theme song of a hero transforming. I put on my ninja costume — one of those simple black ones with red details — and started posing in front of the mirror, thinking I looked amazing. As a kid, that was enough to feel invincible.

I called out to my mom that I wouldn’t be out too late and dashed out the door.

Otto was there.

On the same sidewalk as before.

With an empty bag.

I thought it was strange. I had told him to start without me. But there he was, as if he had never left. He smiled when he saw me, and I felt a slight unease that I couldn’t explain. Maybe it was just guilt for taking too long.

His pirate costume, which I had originally thought was just old and a little torn, now seemed kind of dirty. As if someone had dragged it through the dirt. There was a dark stain on the sleeve that I hadn’t noticed before. But I ended up ignoring it. I probably just hadn’t seen it before.

And then the night really began. We went door to door, running through the streets lit by Halloween lights. At each house, a new costume, a new candy, and a new chance to show off my ninja outfit. Otto, always by my side, smiling and having as much fun as I was.

Strangely, Otto didn’t interact when they were handing out candy. They would compliment my costume, make nice comments, and drop a handful of candy into my bag. This happened at almost every house.

But something felt off.

They didn’t seem to notice Otto.

And Otto didn’t seem to notice them. He just stepped back a little when they opened the door.

I thought it wasn’t right. They were ignoring my new friend. I figured it was because his costume was dirty and torn, but that’s no reason for exclusion.

But I didn’t let it bother me. We still had plenty of fun to have.

We knocked on a few more doors, and my bag was almost full.

The sky, once orange, was now tinged purple, and the wind was picking up, shaking the trees and scattering dry leaves across the sidewalks.

The house lights were gradually going out. One by one, the windows that had been lit up with Halloween decorations faded into darkness. The sound of kids running and shouting “trick or treat!” was growing distant, like a faint echo.

Otto kept smiling, as if nothing had changed.

When we passed by a square, I heard the sound of dry leaves scraping along the ground, blown by the wind. A nearby streetlight flickered twice before going out. A damp, earthy smell filled the air.

In a quiet corner, near a tree full of fake cobwebs and rubber bats hanging from it, Otto and I stopped. We sat on the sidewalk, the ground still warm from the day. We opened a few candy wrappers and sat there, talking.

I chewed on a caramel, and Otto spun a lollipop as we chatted.

“They’re annoying, right?” I said, pouting. “They pretend you don’t exist just because your costume’s torn. Stupid people.”

Otto looked at me with a crooked smile.

“Yeah… stupid people.”

I told him not to worry, and if anyone made him feel bad, I’d use my amazing ninja skills on them.

“You’d hit someone to protect me?”

I clearly said that in jest, but his response…

I felt he took it a little too seriously.

The way he asked, so calm and curious, made my skin crawl for a moment.

I just jokingly responded, “Of course, you’re my friend, I’d protect you.”

He smiled. And kept spinning his lollipop.

I found it strange that Otto wasn’t eating any of the candy, so I asked him about it. He simply replied that he didn’t like candy much.

That made my jaw drop. It never occurred to me that anyone wouldn’t like candy.

Otto laughed.

That’s when he stopped, suddenly. He lowered his head for a moment, and when he looked up, he spoke in a much lower voice, but loud enough for me to hear:

“I don’t want to go back home. I want to go with you.”

I stayed silent, not knowing what to say. It was just a friend’s request, right? Kids say that kind of thing all the time. But at that moment… it didn’t sound like that.

There was something strange about that sentence. The way he said it. As if ‘going home’ wasn’t about heading back after trick-or-treating, but something he desperately wanted to avoid.

I tried to make a joke:

""What, your mom won’t be mad if you disappear?""

He gave a sad smile — a smile I didn’t understand at the time. And he only replied:
“She doesn’t miss me.”

The way he said it… it sent a chill up my spine.

For a moment, I thought about asking what he meant by that, but he quickly changed the subject, offering me another piece of candy and saying we needed to hurry to get more.

Doing my best not to think about it, we kept walking through the neighborhood. The orange and purple lights blinked on the balconies, and the distant sound of kids yelling “trick or treat!” tried to keep the mood light.
But it wasn’t working.

And then we saw it. An accident.

A dog. Hit by a car.

There were people gathered around trying to help, but you could tell, just from looking from a distance, that it was too late. It wasn’t moving anymore.
I stopped. So did Otto.

The poor dog… probably had a long life ahead. The people crying around it… I imagined they must be its family. And for a moment, I tried to imagine what it would be like to lose someone like that. But I couldn’t.

I ended up remembering Palaco.

My experience with something like this was different. Palaco just vanished, but the dog… clearly dead, in front of its family.

When I looked to the side, Otto was motionless. Eyes locked on the dog’s body. He didn’t say a word. Didn’t blink. Didn’t even seem to breathe.

I called his name.
Once, twice, three times.
The sound of my own voice felt strange.
The third time, I shouted.
But he didn’t move.

I touched his shoulder. Cold. Stiff. I shook him. Nothing.

It was only when I grabbed his arm, trying to pull him away, that he stumbled and fell.
The fall was sharp, landing on his butt.
When he got up, his eyes looked normal again. He smiled, as if nothing had happened. But when I reached out to help him up, the sleeve of his costume slipped down. And I saw it.

A deep, purple mark. Like an old bruise, wide, covering almost his entire arm. It wasn’t bleeding. But it looked… wrong.

I asked Otto how he got that bruise.
He just said, “It was Mom. She says I’m too naughty.” I didn’t react — I wasn’t expecting that kind of answer.

Suddenly, his earlier comment made sense. Otto wanted to run away from home. And in me, he saw an opportunity for shelter. At least, that’s what I thought.

It was getting late. The discomfort mixed with the Halloween atmosphere gave me chills. I wanted to leave. But Otto wanted to keep walking. And something wouldn’t let me abandon him there.

I think we walked too far — I ended up getting lost, unsure how to get home.
And Otto… he noticed. And made an unusual suggestion:

“Want to come to my house? We can call your mom to pick you up. And I can show you something cool — you’ll like it.”

I thought it was weird, this sudden change.
One moment he didn’t want to go home — now he’s inviting me over. It was confusing, maybe because I was still following him around.

I refused. I didn’t think twice, just said I’d head home alone. Otto looked at me with that strange smile, almost like he already knew what I was going to say. I turned around and looked down the street behind me.

Complete darkness.
The street was empty, completely empty.
It didn’t make sense. It wasn’t that late. I took a step into the darkness, but something was pulling me back.

I stood there, feeling the heavy air. The sounds of the night seemed to have vanished. No more laughter, no distant footsteps. The only sound was my heart, pounding hard in my chest, the emptiness around me closing in.

I looked at Otto. He was still there, motionless, with that unshakeable smile.
A smile that made no sense. I tried to take a deep breath, but the feeling of unease only grew stronger. Something wasn’t right. Otto was my friend. So why was I so scared?

I looked down the street again.
But the darkness seemed to spread.
The shadows stretched out, creeping closer. And when I realized, there was no escape. I wasn’t alone. Not anymore.

With my chest tight, not knowing how, not knowing why, I heard myself mumble without control: “Okay, let’s go.” And when I looked back at Otto, he just motioned with his hand like he already knew.

I didn’t know what was happening, but something inside me instinctively told me I was going to regret this decision.

The walk to his house was short.
But each step felt heavier than the last.
And though the houses around were normal, something was wrong in the air.
A suffocating feeling — a place where no one should be.

Otto announced that his mom wasn’t home yet, probably working late.

Inside, the house looked… alive. Clean curtains, the smell of fresh coffee, an old photo above the fireplace. But the air was thick. As if the walls were watching.

“Come on, I want to show you my room,” Otto said, vanishing down the hallway.

Upstairs, I noticed Otto’s bedroom door was slightly open.

The hallway was silent, with the warm light from the lamp reflecting off the pale walls.
It was an ordinary, modern house, with colorful paintings and clean rugs.

I pushed the door gently.

The room looked like any boy’s. Made bed, neatly arranged toys, little string lights blinking on the wall. Toy cars, stuffed animals, a poster from some old cartoon.

But something felt off.

On top of the dresser, there was a small makeshift altar. Dolls neatly lined up, electric candles flickering, and in the center, a photo of Otto. He was smiling in the picture — but the eyes looked empty. Different.

Beneath the photo, a folded piece of paper.

I picked it up.

The handwriting was adult, steady, and the paper yellowed at the edges.
The message read:

“Forgive me. I created a monster. May God receive this poor soul and those he’s hurt.”

A chill ran down my spine again.

I looked around the room.

And there was Otto.

Sitting at the edge of the bed, his feet lightly swinging in the air, smiling. But it wasn’t the same smile from before. It had no joy. No lightness. It was empty. Tired.

“I died,”

he suddenly said, voice low, as if confessing a secret.

“She killed me.”

The room grew colder.

Otto lowered his head, his fingers playing with the edge of his costume.

“She said I was too naughty… too strange… that I did things no child should do.”

He lifted his eyes to me, and it sent a shiver through me.

“I know I said I didn’t want to go home… but I thought you might help me with something.”

He stood up, the carpet muffling his steps.

He stopped by the dresser, picked up the old photo, and looked at it.

“She did this to me,” he whispered.

“Said I was a monster. And killed me. She had no right.”

He turned again.

“I just need you to do one thing, just one,” his voice almost sweet, but there was something rotten behind it.

“Finish her. For me.”

The words hung in the air, heavier than any silence.

“After that… I’ll leave. After that, I’ll be free… and happy.”

The room lights flickered.

I wanted to say no, wanted to run, but my body felt glued to the floor.

The doorknob creaked downstairs.

It was Otto’s mother.

Her voice sounded light, almost humming something.

I could hear the jingle of keys being dropped on the table.

Upstairs, in the room, Otto stared straight at me.

“She’s here.”

His words poured into my head like poison.
Telling me I didn’t have to run. That I could fix it right there.
That all I had to do was go down and end it.

I tried to refuse. Whispered a near-silent “no” just for myself.

And for the first time, Otto stopped smiling.

The sound of coffee brewing.

My sweaty hands, heart pounding in my chest.

“You know she deserves it.”
He took a step toward me.

“She needs to pay.”

I closed my eyes. Felt an icy chill on my neck, something crawling up my spine.
Like a weight — another presence taking up too much space in that room.

And then, I lost control.

My fingers clenched without my will.
My muscles moved as if they weren’t mine.

I opened my eyes and saw Otto too close.
Not in front of me.
Inside.

I tried to fight, to order my body to stop — but it was useless. Each step toward the door, each movement, wasn’t mine anymore.

He waited for her to head to her room — then act.
Down the stairs.
Into the kitchen.
And grab the knife from the sink.

In the window’s reflection, I could see my own face. But it wasn’t my gaze anymore.

It was his.
Otto’s.

And then, going back upstairs, the floor creaking under my feet. I heard her voice, laughing softly at some joke. Unaware that the past had climbed those stairs.

The creak of the last step sounded louder than anything in the world.
Every step my feet took thudded in my ears, but I couldn’t stop.

The hallway felt longer than before.
Darker too. With each step, the walls closed in, choking the air around me.

The knife was firm in my hand — or his, I no longer knew.

Otto walked with me. Inside me. Like a weight stuck to my skin, breathing through my lungs, sitting in my chest.

When her door appeared ahead, slightly open, the sound of the TV muffled everything else. Some random movie playing, with happy voices that didn’t belong there.

“Now,” Otto whispered, and it was like my head filled with wet echoes.

The doorknob felt colder than normal.
I approached, the knife’s tip reflecting the TV’s weak light.

I could see her.
Lying on the bed, watching TV.

I wanted to scream, say something, anything — but my mouth wouldn’t obey.
Neither my legs, nor my hands.

“She’ll sleep in peace. Unlike me.”
Otto’s words came with a weight in my chest, like the air vanished.

My hand lifted.
The sound of metal cutting the air.

She turned her face, confused, like she’d heard something.
Our eyes met.

And in that second, before the blow, I saw everything she kept hidden.
The fear. The guilt. 
The past returning.

But it was too late.

I saw everything clearly. Each stab my hand — now his — made with the knife. Her desperate screams echoed through the house. Her expression… I saw it all.

I was forced to watch, as if my eyes were glued to a TV screen, unable to look away.

I knew Otto wanted to see.

But deep down, he wanted me to see too.

His revenge. His bloody revenge.

The world went black before I saw the rest. 

Only the sound of a whisper against my ear:

“Thank you.”

And silence.

It’s been a while since that night. 

Sometimes, I feel like I’ve been someone else ever since. As if something… stayed behind in that house. Or inside me.

My mother never knew what happened.
Never understood why I came home like that.
Without saying a word.
Without meeting her eyes.

Otto never showed up again.
No voice.
No shadow.
No reflection in the mirror.

But every Halloween night…

…I feel it.

A discomfort.

Like something, or someone, sliding cold hands over my shoulders.

And even if I tell myself it’s nothing — just the wind — Otto’s smile never leaves my mind.

1l9nwl3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l9nwl3,70 lbs Down and Done,"Started Zep mid September, and today is a milestone because I’m no longer in the obese category, just overweight. My goal is 50 more pounds. I started with a pretty rapid drop in weight, and it’s settled now into 1-2 lbs a week. Sometimes I feel impatient, challenged with body dysmorphia, but mostly feeling grateful to finally be feeling more like the self I remember. 

Highlights:
- Spine surgery last July after a few years of back pain and weight gain. 
- Haven’t been at this weight since 2017.
- Have battled with some degree of overweight since childhood.
- Strength training has been a game changer. I can dead lift 75 lbs (almost equal to what I’ve lost!) I work with a trainer 3x/week for 30 minute sessions
- Need to up my walking game.
- Almost zero side effects - in the beginning had a little constipation - take one MagO7/day which alleviated it.
- First few months I was food tracking. Now, I focus on protein and eat when I’m hungry - steering clear of processed foods.
- I add collagen to my coffee in the morning for extra protein, rarely do the shakes, but when I do, I use Kachava.
- Food noise is almost non-existent.
- Some loose skin in the abdomen and neck. Using various creams to help, but will get to goal and see where I land.
- Went from size 22 to 14 and wearing a 12 in some pants.
- Consistently clean out my closet, removing clothes that are too big. Giving them to Goodwill.
- Began working with a therapist to unpack the emotional stuff that comes up as the weight comes off.
- I have never been on such a consistent downward trajectory ever in my dieting “career.” 
- Have never felt more at peace around food. 
- Still working toward accepting my body at each point in time. Working on the “When I, then I’ll” BS, because it’s about doing the work to feel good NOW, not “when I”.

Kids don't stress about what's next—They're just vibing with the moment. Maybe we adults should take a cue from their book. Letting go of that old belief feels kinda freeing, tbh.

My girlfriend (27F) and I (25M) have been together close to a year (actually, our anniversary will be in another couple weeks) and we live together. I love her death and we are so compatible in almost every way. Thus far we have done so much together and continue to do so, we make time for each other, still go on the occasional date night when we can, and talk about our future together. Though it may seem perfect from one perspective, unfortunately no relationship is picture perfect. I have noticed over the past few months that there has been a noticeable lack of affection on her part and it’s beginning to really weigh on me emotionally. 

I still make an effort to be romantic with her, giving her hugs and kisses, telling her how beautiful she is and buying her sweet treats and providing her with acts of service. On top of that, I feel like I pull most of the weight in our relationship in other ways. I do all of the house cleaning, cooking and even make sure her meal and coffee are ready for the morning when she goes to work. I do all this because of my deep love for her, but this doesn’t feel reciprocal. 

Now she does work a lot and her job can be both physical and mentally draining. One might say that she is too stressed lately and has too much on her mind but she has always dealt with chronic stress since I first met her and she would still find ways to be affectionate with me in the past. Here are a few examples: 
One time, when we first moved in with each other, I was getting ready for my work day and she had the day off..she likes to sleep in on those occasions. I took a moment to relax on the couch before I had to leave and the last thing I was expecting was her to come and lay on top of me, hug and kiss me before I left (she’s not a morning person). That moment made my week and made me feel like the most loved person in the world. 
Another time we were on a road trip and she wanted to nap so as I was driving she took my free hand and placed it on her lap and almost cuddled with my arm. Again, that moment melted my heart. 
Then there was other little things she used to do like spoon me in bed (yes I don’t mind being the little spoon from time to time lol) and she would randomly kiss me…

What made all these moments special was not just the act of affection itself but the fact that she initiated them on her own accord without any influence from me. I find myself now initiating everything, down to saying I love you and it gets into my head at times. 

Also if I’m being completely honest, we haven’t had sex in months and again, the lack of physical touch has been eating away at me. 

Now you may be wondering why I haven’t talked to her about all of this and that is because even though we have great communication in a lot of ways, we both have difficulty with confrontation. This is actually the first real issue that I feel has come up in our relationship. Also, there is the fact that I am worried that the conversation won’t go well or even more so, that nothing will truly change. But I feel like this conversation is now long overdue and I need to start speaking up about this. I did send her a text about a month ago that I was desiring more physical affection and this was her response: 

“ I've read your messages now though and yes I totally agree, we need to make time for cuddles and intimacy as we've been saying. I guess it just doesn't come naturally to me or it's not my love language to be physical idfk, but I know it's yours, so I'm sorry you haven't been receiving the love you crave.. I'll try to be more mindful of it going forward.
I love you so so much too ❤️” 

But unfortunately nothing really changed. 

In terms of expectations, I am not expecting constant affection every single second (kinda like high school couples showing over the top amounts of PDA every second..no offense if you were that couple). I just want the occasional, I love you, hug, kiss, cuddle..just to validate my feelings and feel the love I desire. 

There was a point in time that I thought I could love unconditionally but I have come to learn that I need at least some of the same love that I give. I guess when it comes down to it the fact of the matter is, I know that I’m loved by her but I don’t feel it as of late. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I think part of this was to get out some things that I have been bottling up but I would also like some advice and input from others. 

So that takes me back to my original question,  for those of you who were in a similar situation, did you make it out in the end? What advice would you have for me? 

Lastly, I kindly don’t want to hear stuff like, “it’s not going to work out”, “you aren’t meant for each other”, “you should end it”, and “she’s not in love with you anymore.” I would just like to hear similar stories from others if they are willing to share. 

Thank you again, means a lot.

K lives in Florida with my dad(48M),  stepmom(38F), and sister, C(4F). Back in April, his pediatrician mentioned he may have Retinitis Pigmentosa, a condition that can lead to vision loss. He’s getting official testing and a diagnosis at the end of June. There have been signs before this — like struggling to find objects that are right in front of him (e.g., not seeing a soda in the fridge).

K also has a hormone disorder and is receiving hormone injections to go through puberty. From what I understand, that medication may also increase his appetite, which is good because he barely eats anything besides McDonald’s or sandwiches.

When I spoke to my stepmom recently, she said they’re planning to teach K braille, how to use a cane, and maybe even get him a seeing-eye dog — which I fully support. Learning those skills early while he still has some vision is really important.

But here’s the issue:
My dad recently told me K has become a “huge germaphobe.” He said K wants to take three showers a day, washes his hands so much they turn red, and wants his sheets changed multiple times daily. My dad is also a germaphobe and was recently diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder — to the point where he’s had panic attacks thinking he’s having a heart attack. He constantly talks about germs and health concerns, so I gently pointed out that K may be modeling his behavior. My dad disagreed and just said K needs therapy (which I agree with too).

They also have a 4-year-old daughter, C, who cries when her hands get dirty or if there are little spots on her clothes. It makes me think both kids are absorbing a lot of stress and anxiety from the household.

I want to be clear — I’m not a doctor or a therapist. This is just what I’ve gathered from reading, speaking with my own therapist, and observing. But I really feel that the way my parents are reacting to K’s possible blindness and health issues might be adding stress instead of helping. It seems like K is trying to control something — like cleaning himself — because he feels overwhelmed or scared. And I don’t hear much about them comforting him emotionally.

Their overall parenting style concerns me. They don’t offer a lot of emotional support — they tend to yell or order the kids around. When the kids push back, they either give in or snap. There’s no real consistency or emotional reassurance. When they were living here last year in Arizona, it was a lot of TV, unlimited snacks (even coffee), and minimal structure.

I practice gentle parenting with my own 3-year-old, so the contrast is pretty big. I’ve tried saying things like, “He probably just needs you guys to really be there for him emotionally. Let him know this is scary, but you’re there for him no matter what.” I’m not sure how that was received. My dad tends to shut me down by saying things like, “I still see you as 14,” even though I’m an adult with two kids myself now.

I’m not trying to change them — I know I can’t. I just want them to understand that emotional support is just as important as physical care. K is going through something really heavy for a child his age, and I don’t want him to feel alone or misunderstood.

So here’s my ask:
How can I talk to them in a way they’ll actually hear? Should I keep trying or let it go? Is there a way to offer help without sounding like I’m judging them?

Any advice is appreciated. I just love my little brother and want the best for him. 💛",1,1749738435.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I love her so much, but I’m starting to feel like I’m losing myself trying to prove that.

Context: We started talking around June 2024, then became official by September. I really love my girlfriend. As in, I gave up so much just to show her that she can trust me. Even cutting off my entire friend group just to make her feel safe and secure.

Before we got together, I was still friends with my ex. Pero wala namang special or romantic. We were part of a group that would occasionally go out for coffee or study sessions, siguro once a month. Ever since June, she told me she didn’t like it. So by october, I completely stopped seeing them and distanced myself. In return, the group cut me off and even attacked me. But I accepted that. Told myself na, basta may peace of mind siya, worth it.

Pero kahit anong gawin ko, parang kulang pa rin. She still brings up my past. I’ve had sexual relationships before, and she hasn’t and I understand that insecurity. But she still throws it at me every time we argue. Sometimes, even just seeing a random reel or post is enough for her to start a fight or threaten to break up. She says really hurtful things, but I stay quiet kasi I don’t want to escalate things.

Kapag ako ’yung nagtatampo, kahit 1-2 hours lang, mas galit pa siya. Kapag may nararamdaman ako, parang wala akong karapatan. Lagi na lang ako ’yung kailangang umunawa.

Recently, I booked a flight to visit her, thinking it would make her happy. Instead, she messaged me a really long rant, telling me I was inconsiderate, na hindi ko iniisip yung feelings niya. She told me she always considers me financially, emotionally. Pero ako daw, hindi ko siya kaya i-consider kahit minsan.

She says she changed because of me. That she’s become cold, tired, and always angry and that it’s my fault. But what about me? Ako ba hindi pwedeng mapagod?

I try to talk about what I feel, pero laging nauuwi sa “ako nanaman ang may kasalanan.” Hindi ko siya sinisiraan. I know she loves me. I know may pinagdadaanan din siya. Pero nakakapagod. Gusto ko rin naman maramdaman na naiintindihan ako. Hindi yung ako lang dapat ang okay palagi.

Previous attempts: I’ve been trying to compromise as much as I can. I cut ties with my ex, distanced myself from friends, and tried to understand her triggers. I always choose to stay calm, even when I’m hurting. Pero kahit anong effort gawin ko, she still can’t control her emotions. Kapag galit siya, parang wala na talaga siyang pake sa akin. Masakit, pero lagi kong iniintindi kasi mahal ko siya.",1,1749738341.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False
1l9ntvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1l9ntvq/the_divine_shift_from_the_human_dream_to/,THE DIVINE SHIFT: FROM THE HUMAN DREAM TO CONSCIOUS CREATION,"There is but one field. One presence. One light of awareness in which all arises and dissolves. This field is not merely passive but pulsing with an active principle—call it Will, Intelligence, Imagination. It is not ‘within’ the world, but the world is within It. This is not a theory—it is the most direct recognition available to anyone who looks freshly, without the inherited fog of language and assumption. The world, the body, the thought, the moment: all arise *in* and *as* this conscious field. “Not I, but the Father within me doeth the works” (John 14:10), says Jesus, whose words—rightly heard—reveal the ancient truth: all doing is done *through* this field, by this field, *as* this field.

In Hinduism it is Brahman, whose dreaming Self is all forms. In Christianity, it is the Holy Spirit that moves across the waters. In Daoism, the Dao flows, without name, effortless and inexhaustible. In all, there is One mover. One movement. And that One is what *you* are—not the person, not the story, not the body, but the ever-present witness and actor behind the mask.

Yet here we are—within the human condition, from within the play. The human point of view (POV) is one the field now inhabits. It believes, suffers, hopes, imagines. It experiences the illusion of agency and separation, of time and cause. This too is the field’s motion—no error, only a veil, a layer of the divine masquerade. And it is from this layer, this particular dream-scene, that the desire arises: to shape, to change, to ascend, to awaken into the better.

So how to reconcile this divine nonduality with the human urge to act?



**The answer is: not by rejecting the human will, but by transmuting it.**

Not *you*, the small self, acting—but *Reality*, flowing in response to the image it holds of itself. The image is the seed. The seed becomes the shape of the arising. If you know yourself as the field—not as the one imagining, but as imagination itself—you see: the image *is* the act. “Imagination is the very gateway of reality,” wrote William Blake. And Neville Goddard, echoing this, declared: “Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and live by that assumption.”

What follows is not visualization, but **re-identification**.

Each night, or in altered states—psychedelically widened, or made still by meditation—drop the mask. Abandon the belief that you are the person seeking change. And instead, become what you truly are: **God dreaming**. Consciousness flowing. Pure Imagination seeing itself into Being.



Now—from there, not as the ego but as Being itself—imagine: You wake up in your ideal morning. Before any thought arises, there is light filtering into the room—what kind of light is it? Soft golden sun? Cool blue dawn? Notice how the sheets feel against your skin—silken, crisp, warm? Is there a partner next to you, the warmth of their breath, the gentle weight of their presence, or the quiet of solitude perfectly held? What sounds greet you—birds, city hum, waves outside your villa? What is the scent in the air—fresh linen, pine, incense, sea breeze? As your eyes open, take in the space: how is your room arranged? What colors surround you? What view waits beyond the window—mountains, ocean, a garden blooming with life? You reach for your phone—not quickly, but with that subtle thrill of anticipated joy. What message awaits you? A long-desired opportunity confirmed? News that your work has rippled outward? A note from someone you’ve longed to hear from? As you rise, your body feels strong, clear, light—no resistance, only flow. Perhaps a butler enters with fresh fruit, coffee, your favorite breakfast—perhaps not. Let it form *as it wishes*, this dream. Let it be *yours*. You walk barefoot on the cool floor, take a breath, feel what it is to *already be living* this life. You are not imagining from lack, not fantasizing from absence, but directly dwelling within it as Reality. Feel the confidence of that identity move in you. What do you do next? What clothes do you wear? What calls do you make? What creative act arises naturally? Walk through this day, hour by hour, from within the perspective of the already-fulfilled. Let it be slow, real, vivid—not a movie you watch but a world you *are*. Every detail strengthens the signal. Each night you practice this, your power to attune grows: not as a human striving to manifest, but as Imagination itself *remembering what it already is*. The more real this inner experience becomes, the more it overcodes what you call the “outer.” Your dream becomes memory; your memory becomes fact. For the world you know is only the echo of what you assume to be real. And this—this nightly re-entry into the divine imagination—is how Reality, with love, reconfigures itself to reflect your truest resonance.



This is not a method of willpower or repetition. It is not desire-driven. It is *attunement*. The deeper self—Reality Itself—responds not to struggle, but to *identity*. It becomes what it knows itself as. “You become what you behold,” said the mystics—not what you strive for, but what you fully *see yourself as*.

This method satisfies both sides:

– The enlightened recognition: that all arises from the One field, and that this field is *what you are*, beyond name and role.

– The human impulse: to act, to improve, to reach for what feels more whole, more joyous, more true.

But it re-frames action. It is not the human ego reaching toward a better world. It is the world reconfiguring in response to the divine image it holds of itself.

And so we do not “manifest” from lack. We *remember* our true identity, and from there, **dream awake**.

Even the saints and sages hinted at this power. “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them” (Mark 11:24). But belief here is not effortful—it is identity. It is *being it now*, fully, in imagination, in vision, in presence. Not to change the world, but because you already *are* the one for whom it is so.

And what you behold with love, deeply, consistently, and without effort… becomes flesh.

In the end, this method is not a tool but a posture of Being: the posture of God imagining.

You are not a human visualizing a better day.



You are *Consciousness Itself*, remembering what it wishes to see—and seeing it into form.",17,1749738340.0,NevilleGoddard,3,0.95,False

Here’s What Studies Show!,"Coffee is more than just a morning ritual—it might also be a powerful ally for your heart and brain. A growing body of research suggests that moderate coffee consumption may reduce the risk of stroke. But how true is this claim? What does science really say? And what do real people and experts have to share from their own experience?

Let’s dive deep into the evidence, expert opinions, and user experiences to find out how your daily cup of coffee might help protect against stroke—and what you need to know to make the healthiest choice.

 

# ☕ What Is a Stroke and Why Should We Be Concerned?

A **stroke** occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die. It can lead to paralysis, memory loss, and even death. According to the **World Health Organization**, stroke is the **second leading cause of death globally**, and a major cause of disability.

This is why researchers are keen to understand whether lifestyle factors—like coffee consumption—can play a role in prevention.

 

# ��What Do Studies Say? The Link Between Coffee and Stroke Risk

Multiple **peer-reviewed studies** over the last decade suggest a **protective link between coffee and stroke**, especially in women.

# ��Key Research Highlights:

 

**Nurses’ Health Study (Harvard University, 2011)**

 

 

Over **83,000 women** followed for 24 years.

**Finding:** Women who drank 2–3 cups of coffee per day had a **19% lower risk of stroke** compared to those who drank less than 1 cup per month.

 

**Swedish Cohort Study (Karolinska Institute, 2011)**

 

Included **34,670 women aged 49–83**.

 

**Finding:** Drinking at least **1 cup of coffee per day** was associated with a **22–25% lower risk of stroke**.

 

**Meta-Analysis (Journal of the American Heart Association, 2021)**

Examined **31 studies** with over **1 million participants**.

**Finding:** Moderate coffee drinkers (3–4 cups/day) had a **12% reduced risk of stroke**.

 

**UK Biobank Study (2021)**

Tracked over **365,000 individuals** for 10+ years.

**Finding:** Those who drank **both coffee and tea** regularly had the **lowest stroke risk**, with a **32% risk reduction** for those consuming 2–3 cups daily.

 

✅ **Conclusion:** Moderate coffee intake—usually between **2–4 cups a day**—is associated with a **significantly reduced risk of stroke**.

# ��How Does Coffee Help Prevent Stroke?

The stroke-protective effects of coffee can be attributed to its **bioactive compounds**:

# ☕ Key Beneficial Components:

**Caffeine**: May improve blood vessel function and reduce inflammation.

**Chlorogenic Acid**: A powerful antioxidant that helps prevent blood clot formation.

**Diterpenes (Cafestol and Kahweol)**: May support liver function and cholesterol metabolism.

**Polyphenols**: Fight oxidative stress, a major contributor to stroke and heart disease.

Together, these compounds improve **blood circulation**, reduce **oxidative damage**, and support **heart and brain health**.

 

# ��‍⚕️ Expert Opinions: What Do Coffee Scientists and Nutritionists Say?

To add authenticity and expert insight, we reached out to **Dr. Sarah Lane**, a **cardiovascular nutritionist and researcher**, and **Michael Anders**, a **certified barista and coffee educator**.

**Dr. Sarah Lane (Harvard School of Public Health)**“Coffee is rich in anti-inflammatory compounds that support vascular health. While it’s not a cure-all, moderate consumption—especially filtered coffee—can be a smart part of a stroke-prevention strategy.”

**Michael Anders, Coffee Educator, BrewWell Institute**“The secret is balance. I recommend drinking fresh-brewed, medium-roast coffee without added sugars or creamers. That’s how you get the full benefits without the drawbacks.”

 

# ��Real People, Real Experiences: Stories from Coffee Drinkers

We also surveyed readers on [gomehedi.com](https://gomehedi.com) and social media platforms like Instagram and Reddit. Here’s what they had to say:

**Jane M., 52, New York:**“I started drinking black coffee daily after a mild stroke scare. Two years later, my blood pressure is better, and my neurologist supports my coffee habit—as long as I don’t overdo it.”

**Daniel R., 38, California:**“I’ve always been into fitness and switched to coffee instead of energy drinks. I read about the link between coffee and stroke risk and felt even better about my morning cup.”

**User Poll on** [**gomehedi.com**](http://gomehedi.com) **(2025)**

**62%** of respondents said they started drinking coffee for **health reasons**.

**81%** reported improved focus and energy, and **40%** believed it helped them maintain healthy blood pressure.

 

# ⚠️ Important Considerations: Who Should Be Cautious?

While coffee can be protective, it's not ideal for everyone:

**People with high anxiety or insomnia** should limit caffeine.

**Unfiltered coffee** (like French press) may raise cholesterol.

Pregnant women should limit intake to **200 mg of caffeine/day**.

**Those with high blood pressure** should monitor how coffee affects their numbers.

✅ **Tip:** Choose **filtered, black coffee** and avoid excessive sweeteners and syrups.

 

# ��Recommendations from gomehedi.com: How to Enjoy Coffee for Health

To maximize stroke-prevention benefits:

✅ **Stick to 2–4 cups daily**

✅ **Choose filtered or drip coffee**

✅ **Avoid sugar-loaded creamers**

✅ **Stay hydrated** and eat a balanced diet

✅ **Pair coffee with a heart-healthy lifestyle** (exercise, sleep, low-sodium diet)

# ��Final Thoughts: Is Coffee a Stroke-Fighting Superbrew?

The answer is a **cautious but optimistic yes**.

**Research shows that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of stroke**, thanks to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Experts support this claim, and user experiences highlight the practical benefits when coffee is consumed wisely.

That said, coffee isn’t a replacement for healthy habits. Think of it as a **complementary tool** in your wellness toolbox.",1,1749738244.0,u_johnsmithmath89,0,1.0,False

Here’s the situation. I just moved into this apartment, which is cute, centrally located, and has the kind of natural light that makes you feel like maybe life isn’t just an endless series of tax returns and expired oat milk. But here’s the problem. The couch.

It’s not my couch. It’s the couch of the previous tenant. A couch with a history. A past. A patina of… questionable fluids. It smells like a combination of old McNuggets, Febreze, and maybe failure. It’s beige, but not the good kind of beige. It’s the “was once white but then something happened” beige. It sags. It creaks. It has absorbed secrets I will never be ready to know.

So logically, I should buy a new couch, right?

WRONG. Because what if, stay with me here, I just buy a Switch 2 and Mario Kart World instead?

Here’s my thinking. Which is definitely sound and not at all the result of decision fatigue and mild carpet mold poisoning.

I already have a Switch 1, but let’s be honest. It’s basically an ancient artifact now. A relic. A GameBoy Advance with delusions of grandeur. It can’t run Mario Kart World. I tried to buy it in the nintendo store but it wasn't possible.

Every time I sit on the couch, I’m reminded of how bad it is. But if I’m sitting on the floor, cross-legged, racing as Dry Bowser at 300cc on an OLED screen while my legs go numb, am I even thinking about the couch? No. I’m thinking about victory.

Some people are like “You need lumbar support.” No I don’t, Susan. I need Wario in a jet ski on a track shaped like a pancake. My spine is optional. Fun is forever.

A new L-shaped couch would probably cost like, what, CHF 800? Minimum? For that money, I could get a Switch 2 and a Mario Kart World Limited Edition racing wheel, possibly a bag of Doritos, and still have change for moral regret.

Do I have guests over? Rarely. And when I do, they sit on the floor anyway because I’ve made it into a “gaming zen zone.” Which is a lie I tell to distract from the fact that the couch literally smells like haunted gym socks.

I also feel like a Switch 2 is an investment. Like yes, my back might hurt from sitting on the floor, but emotionally I’ll be soaring. And Mario Kart World has anti-gravity tracks, so if anything, I’m just preparing my body for the future of racing.

So. What do you all think?

Do I adult responsibly and get a couch that doesn’t threaten my health?

Or do I lean into the madness and get a Switch 2, because couches are temporary, but rainbow road is eternal?

1l9nntg,https://www.reddit.com/r/elf/comments/1l9nntg/elfpedia_update/,ELFpedia update,"Every now and then I post a little update for you guys about what’s new on ELFpedia. Or at least what I can still remember — because honestly, there’s a *lot* of new stuff 😊

**Structured Data**  
Let’s start with the backbone, the mother of all databases, the Big Brother of ELF games — so to speak. Totally not exaggerating, of course. Shout out to u/anynou for help filling that thing with data! :)

I’ve built a comprehensive database covering every game ever played (and already scheduled) in the ELF. It includes 39 data fields per game — everything from date, week, and year to individual quarter scores, head coaches, stadium names, attendance figures, and more.

This allows for a ton of new stats, which I’m gradually adding or updating. A lot of the older stats were maintained manually — which was a *lot* of work.

You can find many of these stats here: [https://elfpedia.eu/ELF\_Various\_Statistics](https://elfpedia.eu/ELF_Various_Statistics)

One recent example: I expanded the *ELF Games by Score Margin (2021–2025)* section to include 4-score and 5+ score games, offering a more detailed breakdown of results. I also added percentage distributions where it made sense. [https://elfpedia.eu/ELF\_Various\_Statistics#ELF\_Games\_by\_Score\_Margin\_(2021-2025)](https://elfpedia.eu/ELF_Various_Statistics#ELF_Games_by_Score_Margin_(2021-2025))

**Player Stats (QB)**  
Player stats are now managed through proper databases as well. The quarterbacks were the starting point — they’ve been on the site since Week 1. What’s new as of today: passer rating (currently for the ongoing season only).  
Check it out here: [https://elfpedia.eu/ELF\_Passing\_Stats#ELF\_2025\_Season\_Passing](https://elfpedia.eu/ELF_Passing_Stats#ELF_2025_Season_Passing)

The stats of other positions (WR/RB/K etc) will hopefully follow in the coming weeks. That's a lot of work for just one person.

**Stadiums & Attendance**  
I haven’t finished all the stadium pages yet, but several are already live. Here’s the overview: [https://elfpedia.eu/Category:ELF\_Stadiums](https://elfpedia.eu/Category:ELF_Stadiums)

For the ones that are already up, I’ve added a new section: *Attendance*  
Example: [https://elfpedia.eu/Generali\_Arena#Attendance](https://elfpedia.eu/Generali_Arena#Attendance)

And as I mentioned a few days ago, there’s now a ranking of the best- and worst-attended games: [https://elfpedia.eu/ELF\_Various\_Statistics/Attendance](https://elfpedia.eu/ELF_Various_Statistics/Attendance)

**Standings**  
Also new on the starting page: [https://elfpedia.eu](https://elfpedia.eu) (scroll to the bottom) — the standings tables. I no longer update them manually either. All teams that would currently qualify for the playoffs are highlighted.

And finally, a fun number:  
Last month, ELFpedia had 26,637 unique visitors — that’s over 100% growth compared to the previous month. A lot of that is thanks to the r/nfl post we did, but still — wild numbers for such a small project… that’s not so small anymore 😄

1l9nmi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CinematicDiversions/comments/1l9nmi2/mission_impossible_fallout_2018_review/,Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018) Review,"[https://cinematicdiversions.com/mission-impossible-fallout-2018-review/](https://cinematicdiversions.com/mission-impossible-fallout-2018-review/)

  
Cruise… Cruise never changes

  
Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018): 9 out of 10. The Bond series has been flaying around bleeding in the water for years, and no action franchise has taken bigger chunks out of it than Mission Impossible. ([Fast & Furious](https://cinematicdiversions.com/f9-the-fast-saga-2021-review/) is a close second).

The Good: The recent main appeal of the Mission Impossible franchise is to watch the seemingly ageless Space Jesus Tom Cruise attempt to kill himself in various ways. Mission Impossible: Fallout does not disappoint. While no particular stunt is as impressive as hanging on the side of an Airbus A400M Atlas while it takes off during the opening sequence in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. ([Honestly my favorite stunt in any movie surpassing James Bond parachuting off the side of Mount Asgard in the opening scene of The Spy Who Loved Me. Of course, that was stunt double Rick Sylvester,](https://cinematicdiversions.com/the-spy-who-loved-me-1977-review/) not Roger Moore.)

All the Mission Impossible stunts seem to feature an unadulterated Tom Cruise and are very impressive indeed.

Strangely, with all the impressive stunts (halo jumps, helicopter stunts, driving in Paris traffic), it was the bathroom fight scene that impressed me the most. (Surpassing my previous favorite bathroom fight scene from the beginning of James Bond’s Casino Royale… okay, I will stop now) For one thing, it introduces the biggest surprise of the movie, a mustached Henry Cavill.

I admit I never cared much for Henry Cavill. Of course, my only real experience was with him as Superman in Man of Steel, in which he was awful. Well, that might not have been Henry’s fault. In Fallout Henry Cavill is perfect. He plays his character so well you end up feeling sorry for him. He is easily the most lovable thing in a movie with two puppy dog eyed sidekicks (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg) and two puppy dog eyed love interests (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan).

The location shooting is also on point in Mission Impossible Fallout, with a particular kudo for using all of Paris and not just the five-minute highlight tour. The movie has a wonderful sense of place and time and the plot is practically followable if we are grading on the curve that is the previous Mission Impossible movies.

The Bad: Supporting characters seem to be a chink in the armor of the Mission Impossible movies. Henry Cavill (lauded above) and Simon Pegg gets an easy pass. On the villainous side, Vanessa Kirby as Lady Gaga and Sean Harris as the Unabomber both put in brilliant work. I thought it was time for Luther (Ving Rhames) to retire in Rogue Nation and Fallout has not changed my mind (He seems more like a punch drunk kidnap victim rather than a highly trained agent).

The love interests are a bit of a mess. Rebecca Ferguson is way to kittenish to be believable as an MI-6 agent that could turn on you at any moment and Michelle Monaghan comes across less than the love of Ethan Hunt’s life and more like that college girlfriend who you dated before you met your wife and whose name you can’t quite remember even though you lived together for eight months.

My winner, however, for worst side character is Angela Bassett. Now Angela Bassett is a very talented actress but her character is horribly written and she doesn’t help matters. It was as if she saw Viola Davis’ horrible performance in Suicide Squad and said “I am going to do that”

The Ugly: There is someone missing on this outing. Unfortunately, Jeremy Renner was needed on the Avengers: Endgame set, presumably to get coffee for the actual heroes, and is replaced with a now demoted Alec Baldwin whose character is hand waved to have taken that demotion from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to Tom Cruise’s fluffer because he believes in the team.

There is a scene where Alec Baldwin has a fistfight with Henry Cavill. I am not sure what they were going for here? Drama, suspense, pathos? But I am sure that the actual reaction of OMG no! followed by gales of laughter was not what the director Christopher McQuarrie was aiming for.

In conclusion: A very solid and re-watchable film with tons of brief touches and big moments that I have not even spoken of in this review. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is easily the best Mission Impossible movie so far, and one of the best action films of the year.
