 I recall placing everything inside the fridge. My brother and I even shared the junkfood I bought immediately. There's a lot of things to indicate na I was able to bring it back; the RECEIPT I placed by the TV, the soya milk I drank that night, the Trix cereals, the junkfood in the trash, the loaf of bread, Goya choco spread, the Chocomani, the Miso soup mix, and the coffee packets. All of these were in place. 

I'm not too sure about the eggs, kasi I recall having leftovers from last week, and bought just six. In the egg tray, we have exactly 6 eggs and the plastic tray it came with was in the trash too. But then again, my brother also cooked eggs yesterday and had 6 so that trash could be his.

But how could precisely only everything I bought yesterday vanish except the snacks? Maybe the workers who worked on our roof stole it? But my brother was downstairs the entire time they're here, and I don't think they'll do that. Maybe my brother stole it? Why tf would he steal OUR groceries? Maybe I left the groceries someplace else? But I wouldn't ever leave them after arriving home kasi they had meat and all that. The Goya spread was the last one I unpacked too and I remember kasi I thought I broke it when I abruptly placed it down and checked as I put it sa cabinet.


Somehow, the groceries I bought last week was still in place. Even cooked it kahapon. I'm less worried about having to buy again kasi for a few days lang yun, but I'm confused and scared. I'm alone sa house right now and until the next morning. I don't know if I'm crazy forgetful, or idk. I'm super freaked out rn.",1,1730189485.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

# Easy Bonuses for October 2024

[**Up Bank $10 Sign-up Bonus**](https://hook.up.me/freedollars): Receive **$10** when you sign up and make a purchase. I used it to buy a coffee, then cashed out the rest immediately and deleted the app from my phone.

[**ING $125 Referral Bonus**](https://campaigns.ing.com.au/refer?code=Iqo826&p=d) after depositing $1000 and making 5 purchases. Just transfer the money and send it straight back to your normal account. ING has one of the best savings rates at the moment (5.5%) so it's pretty worth it to stick around. ING currently offers free delivery on MenuLog for new customers.

[**ING $50 Cashback for New Customers**](https://campaigns.ing.com.au/bankingwithbenefitscashback?cid=aff:fndr:oth:ing-oe-FY24-SEMOEFTY-50incentiveNTB:finder:gen:229f541cfe1721d51002a4aa76b427): This one is less money but it's not attached to a referral. Use it if you like. Deposit $1,000 within the first 30 days after opening an Orange Everyday account.

# [**UBank: $20 Sign-Up Bonus**](https://www.ubank.com.au/banking). Open an account and make five card purchases within 30 days.

Join UBank by downloading the app. ¬†Use code K6X8JB4.¬†

**Earnings so Far: $155**



# Cash-Back and Rewards Apps

I personally don‚Äôt like these as much as there's the issue of having to spend money to earn your rewards, but if you‚Äôre already planning to buy something it's a good idea to get the discount.¬†

# [**Cashrewards $10 Sign-up Bonus**](https://refer.cashrewards.com.au/x/IaiKUW): Sign up, spend $20 within two weeks, and you get $10.

# [**Shopback $5 Sign-up Bonus**](https://app.shopback.com/HQfY9dRc3Nb): Similar to Cashrewards but has a wider range and frequent bonus offers. Earnings can be transferred directly to your bank or PayPal account once you‚Äôve met the minimum threshold.

# Save on Bills

Use WhistleOut to find the cheapest options for utilities, internet, and phone bills. Big companies often overcharge, while smaller providers offer the same services at a fraction of the cost. Many plans include 3-6 month discounts, so I switch providers whenever a deal expires, saving a significant amount over time.

* Periodically check for the cheapest [Sim Only Phone Plans](https://www.whistleout.com.au/MobilePhones/Search?calls=-1&sms=-1&data=5000&simonly=true&customer=Personal) and [NBN Plans](https://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/National-Broadband-Network-NBN-Plans) and swap whenever you can.
* Keep subscriptions to a minimum. I only pay for Netflix and cancel it if I want Stan, avoiding double charges.¬†
* For advanced users, credit card sign-up bonuses can also be valuable‚Äîjust be sure to pay off your balance monthly. Only keep a card if you truly need it.

[**TPG Phone Discount**](https://www.whistleout.com.au/Transact?pai=3&si=221&gi=28&pi=7308&ct=0&ci=18227&byo=true&ai=60): Lock-in contracts are a scam. I really prefer the small price/big data deals that come out. I currently use TPG Small Plan which is $12.50 for 25gb of data and unlimited everything else for 6 months.¬†

# [**Mate Internet $30 Discount**](https://mate.com.au): Seems to be the cheapest home internet at the moment. Their deal gives you $30 off for 6 months. I currently pay $40 a month for the internet using this deal. I do have a referral bonus here but it requires me to do some things on my end. If you‚Äôre interested, send me a DM :) Otherwise enjoy the fantastic deal.¬†

[**Powershop $75 Sign-up Bonus**](https://secure.powershop.com.au/r/xuminc-rWAbkk3?p=987): This one is pretty crazy if you meet all the criteria. Up to $375 off your energy bills. Without the free credits they are not very competitive. I would swap providers once the bonuses run out.¬†

* **An extra $150 credit** if you swap from another provider¬†
* **An extra $150 credit if you swap your gas account too.**¬†

**Earnings so Far: \~$500**



# Utility and Food Discounts

# [**Guzman Y Gomez Free Burrito**](https://gygau.app.link/ZLNeaAab3Nb): This ones a yummy one. Sign up on the app, get a free burrito! (or price equivalent). Muchos gracias.

# [**Everyday Rewards Sign-up Bonus & 10% Cashback on Groceries**](https://rewards.app.link/GOv7CZxf3Nb): A no-brainer for me. I spend about $150 a week on groceries, which means $15 back a month from the Everyday Extras (which has a free 30 day trial at the moment, otherwise $7 a month). That's in addition to the original bonus. Then you get your points which can give you more savings over time.¬†

[**PetrolSpy**](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/petrol-spy-australia/id826254811)**:** Finds you the cheapest petrol in an area and alerts you when it's a good time to fill up.¬†

**Ampol Energy**: Save **10c per litre** on fuel when you link an Ampol Energy home account to your Everyday Rewards card.



# Additional Ways to Earn & Save

**Government Initiatives**: The current cost-of-living rebates transfer across when you swap providers, which is good to know if you‚Äôre hunting for deals and sign-up bonuses. You can also now buy Rego one month at a time, which might have a use case for you.

[**Honey** **Coupon Finde**](http://joinhoney.com/ref/evuzup)**r**: Honey is a well-known browser extension that automatically finds and applies coupon codes at checkout to save you money on online purchases. It‚Äôs highly recommended for getting the best deals effortlessly. I know it interacts well with Dinnerly if you prefer to order your meals in.¬†

[**Class Action Lawsuits**](https://cartercapner.com.au/class-action/woolworths-coles-class-action/): You can browse through the class action registry to see if there are any class action lawsuits that could return you some money and are very easy to sign up with. Currently Woolworths & Coles are in trouble for allegedly engaging in deceptive pricing practices that misled customers.¬†

[**Find your unclaimed money**](https://moneysmart.gov.au/find-unclaimed-money) at [Moneysmart.gov.au](http://Moneysmart.gov.au)

[**Consolidate your Super using the ATO tool**](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/super-for-individuals-and-families/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/keeping-track-of-your-super/transferring-or-consolidating-your-super)**.** I could write a whole post about how good Super is. TLDR I use Hostplus. I know many people pay the lazy tax by sticking with whatever Super their first job signed them up for. Don‚Äôt be that person!

[**The Queensland Savers**](https://www.queenslandsavers.qld.gov.au/) page offers a range of concessions and rebates to help reduce costs on essentials like energy, transport, education, and housing. Earlier this year I saved $200 on a new washing machine.

CEO & Co-Founder Admits Physical Attraction To Nintendo‚Äôs Bowser In Shocking Unearthed Interview,"Sweet Baby Inc. co-founder and CEO Kim Belair, a name that has come to define controversy in the gaming space, has just become a lot more controversial. In a six year-old Podcast interview unearthed by YouTubers MasterOfTheTDS and WritingRaven who run the [Gothic Therapy YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GothicTherapy), Belair admitted to being physically attracted to the Nintendo character Bowser (a dragon turtle creature).

She then claimed that antelopes called kudus were the most attractive non-human mammal before bragging that she has the skull of one in her home.

https://preview.redd.it/ve1qptyninxd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c281948c39441ef9e4ed92a8bd63966816fca63

If Kim Belair‚Äôs name sounds familiar to you, it‚Äôs because her company, Sweet Baby Inc., has been at the forefront of what has come to be known as GamerGate 2.

Sweet Baby Inc. is a narrative design firm with the goal of reworking game stories to make them more inclusive. Belair has stated in the past that professionals in the gaming industry should actually blackmail developers into bringing Sweet Baby Inc. into the fold.

https://preview.redd.it/afcvlkcrinxd1.jpg?width=1142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92f3a9168319ed74c172ff16406055acbefa19fb

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a creative working in AAA, which I did for many, many years: put this stuff up to your higher-ups,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd if they don‚Äôt see the value in what you‚Äôre asking for when you ask for consultancy, when you ask for research: go have a coffee with your marketing team and just terrify them with the possibility if they don‚Äôt give you what you want.‚Äù

Sweet Baby Inc. garnered the spotlight in a very negative way in early 2024 for its role in designing the narrative for the live-service Rocksteady game *Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League*.

Since then, gamers the world over have been boycotting games the company has worked on, the most recent of which was *Unknown 9 Awakening.*¬†This game saw peak a peak concurrent player count on Steam of 285 players on Friday, October 18th, shortly after its release. It has been steadily declining ever since.

Belair claims to stand for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the gaming space, casting judgement on others she deems problematic. She has railed against gamers, YouTubers, news organizations, and even X CEO Elon Musk, for their coverage of her and her company, describing it as an organized hate campaign.

Belair is one of the first finger waggers to line up and condemn what she sees as immoral behavior.

However, in this podcast interview on an episode of *The Sexiest Podcast*, the Sweet Baby head honcho seems to admit a physical attraction to both fictional and real animals.

She is quoted in the interview stating that Bowser is ‚Äúb\*\*\*age daddy sexy‚Äù before going on to recount her experience when podcast co-host Ari MacGillivray told her to look up ‚ÄúBowser Day‚Äù on Tumblr. She states that she then looked through pages and pages of explicit Bowser images, before MacGillivray went on to describe a particular part of Bowser‚Äôs anatomy in great detail.

‚ÄúSometimes he had a turtle p\*\*\*\* and sometimes he had a mammalian p\*\*\*\*,‚Äù she said.

Belair then seems to try and distance herself from the images before freely admitting that she scrolled through all of them.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of those people who on the internet I‚Äôm going to click it,‚Äù Belair said. ‚ÄúAnd when I go to the Bowser date tag, I can go like ‚Äòoh no this isn‚Äôt what I wanted‚Ä¶ better look at all of it though.'‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/ysz7bq51jnxd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3c9dd042c09571c1f92264fb4d8fffd0bb4beeb

‚ÄúThese are the people who say, ‚Äòhey, you need to come to us and you need to get your game consulted with us to make sure it doesn‚Äôt offend people,‚Äù MasterofTheTDS said sarcastically while reviewing the audio clips. ‚ÄúBut this is okay. This is okay to do.'‚Äù

He then goes on to point out Belair‚Äôs hypocrisy further.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to stand on your high horse and pretend that you‚Äôre better than other people and other gamers because you wouldn‚Äôt stoop to that degeneracy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCaught red-handed‚Äù You not only would stoop to that degeneracy, you are that degeneracy. So, you‚Äôre no better than anybody else who wants to see people from Stellar Blade and wants to see them with less clothes on. You are no better. You are the head of a company who is literally about trying to be inclusive and diverse and to protect women from the terrible gamers. And here you are, being the same degeneracy that you claim to be against!‚Äù

But GothicTherapy wasn‚Äôt done with just Bowser-gate. The married couple went on to uncover something else Belair said that‚Äôs even more bizarre.

MasterOfTheTDS mentioned how former game developer Mark Kern, aka Grummz, has pointed out Belair‚Äôs passion for collecting animal skulls and practicing taxidermy. WritingRaven points out that some people have claimed that this is for witchcraft or Satanism. But apparently it‚Äôs addressed in another of the four total episodes of *The Sexiest Podcast.*¬†

The episode in question contains a discussion about which non-human mammal is ‚Äúsexiest.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd she says the antelope,‚Äù WritingRaven said, noting Belair‚Äôs odd description of a kudu, which is a type of antelope. ‚ÄúWhose skull she has in her house.‚Äù

Belair described kudus as having, ‚Äúthick, girthy necks and very beautiful handsome faces.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worse!‚Äù MasterOfTheTDS quicky states. ‚ÄúEvery single company who literally signs in with these people should be ashamed. I‚Äôm sorry, you want to pander and do whatever, do it on your own. You don‚Äôt need these people. You have skulls of antelope in your house because you like antelope. You are attracted to Antelope!

Short Devotional about Networking and relationship building

Introduction
------------

Networking and relationship building are essential in every walk of life. Whether you‚Äôre embarking on a new career, fostering friendships, or serving your community, strong relationships can be the cornerstone of your success and joy. Just like a well-woven tapestry brings together various threads to create a beautiful image, our connections weave a fabric of support and opportunity in our lives.

God designed us to live in community with one another, and the Bible is filled with examples of powerful relationships. From David and Jonathan‚Äôs deep friendship to the connections among the early disciples, these stories remind us that we‚Äôre not meant to journey through life alone. By cultivating relationships with others, we can experience God‚Äôs love and grace in unique ways that enrich both our lives and the lives of those around us. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into how we can glorify God through the art of networking and relationship building.

Bible Verse
-----------

‚ÄúTwo are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.‚Äù ‚Äî Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 highlights the strength and support that come from being in fellowship with others. When we build relationships, we create a safety net that can catch us in times of trouble and uplift us in moments of triumph. This verse reminds us that life is enriched when shared with others, as each person brings unique gifts and perspectives that can help us grow.

The phrase ‚Äúa good return for their labor‚Äù underscores the benefits of teamwork. When we unite our strengths and efforts, we can achieve far more than we could alone. Moreover, having a trusted network allows us to lean on one another and gain wisdom and encouragement when faced with challenges.

Notably, the passage also warns of the consequences of isolation. Living without connection can leave us vulnerable, and having no one to lift us up can lead to discouragement. However, choosing to invest time and energy into our relationships aligns with God‚Äôs design for us to live interconnected lives, where love and support flourish.

Actions to Take
---------------

His mother and his sister hate each other and are constantly fighting but also interdependent on each other. They got to braking point recently and so my MIL needed to come and stay with us for ten days (we live in different cities) I found her really hard work.

- talks on the phone on speaker in common areas
- constantly doing my washing (and ruining some of my delicate items). I just feel it‚Äôs weird for her to do my laundry anyway, I‚Äôm a fully grown I can do it myself. 
- generally a bit rude, I went out of my way to buy her one of my favourite desserts to try cause we‚Äôd been talking about it and she replied saying: ‚ÄúI would prefer a homemade dessert, store bought isn‚Äôt very nice actually so I don‚Äôt want it‚Äù
- asking for me to get free stuff for her from my work to give to a friend.
- on the Thursday night she agreed to go to coffee the next morning together and she asked what time to be ready in the morning. I said we need to leave at 8am as I have to start work at 9am.

- my partner and I have also just had a really tough infertility diagnosis and she didn‚Äôt ask me once how I was feeling or anything.

I guess they all seem like little things but all together I found her to be quite rude and inconsiderate. 

When she finally left, I told my partner if found it quite hard having her here and gave those examples and said at times I felt she was quite inconsiderate. He got immediately defensive and stormed out of the house saying ‚ÄúI need to process this‚Äù.

1geoutw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1geoutw/it_was_a_joke_all_this_time/,It was a joke all this time.,"Yung first na break up palang natin sana pala dun palang di ko na tinuloy, the mere fact na grabe naramdaman ko dun and gano kadali mo kong binitawan says a lot and kahit sa mga sunod na naging break up natin napansin ko na ganun din sa pakiramdam kahit di kasing lala nung una. 

Ilang beses narin paulit ulit issue natin sa pagpopost hindi naman malaking ask sana yun pero time and again paulit ulit sagot mo na private person ka and etc pero nakikita ko buti pa ibang tao na popost mo maniniwala sana ko totally if wala ka talagang post sa Ig etc. Pero obvious naman na you want to appear single. Ni isang pic natin nor trace natin wala, kahit nung sinabi mo na bakit ako din naman di kita pinopost- nagpost ako ayaw mo lang nakikita mukha mo kasi naniwala ako sa reason mo. Nagpost ako nung sa isang bday ko for flowers etc and may nakaalam tulad ni ***** initially nakita reaction mo di mo nagustuhan dinaan mo nalang sa biro.. kahit sa fb nagrequest ako ng status change iba din reaction mo as if kailangan itago lahat. Kaya sinasabi kong di tugma yung sinasabi mo sa kilos mo kasi time and again lagi kong napapansin na nahihiya ka pag kasama mo ko.. naalala ko yung sa tagaytay coffee bean, ambigat talaga sa loob pinigil ko lang iyak ko, kasi sabi mo naman reason mo inisip ko baka nga ganun lang. pero ayun madaming times na di ko nalang sinasabi iniisip ko nalang baka awkward ka lang, ako na magaadjust.

Tapos yung sa pera issue nakakatrauma talaga siya, sayo ko lang talaga narinig na pinamukha sakin yung ginastos sakin at binilang pa yung worth ko. Tinry ko talagang kalimutan pero now everytime may gastos ka lalo na big purchase nagiisip talaga ko, mej may takot na baka may marinig naman ako kaya naisip ko wag na magrequest kahit yung sa sasakyan - it was nice for me na maexperience magrequest as gf pero kung ganun pala kapalit nun, balik nalang sa dati.. sabi mo baka naisip ko kinukuriputan mo ko at times naiisip ko kasi sa mga lakad mo gumagastos ka,compared to bihira naman satin kasi ang date swerte na once a month, i‚Äôm past that naisip ko pera mo yun wala dapat akong say pero naiisip ko ibang tao nagagastusan mo, ako need ko pa magrequest so inisip ko nalng if gusto mo talagaa gagawin mo, if hindi baka di lang talaga ko ganun kaimportante- ibang rason pa yung nagshoshort ka, alam mo naman na di big deal sakin yun sabi ko aadjust ako. Di ko sinasabing ubusin mo pera mo sakin or something but sana makita mo pinopoint ko.

Alam ko naman na di ako kagandahan or fit ni di ako pasok sa type mo maputi makinis etc- tinanggap ko na, pinilit ko din lunukin natong issue na to. Instead trinry ko magpaputi maglose ng wt etc and walang mali dun. Pero ramdam ko parin na di ako enough. Nakikita ko lagi na nakatingin ka sa iba(iba pa yung may maganda tapos napalingon or yung sabi mo vigilant ka lang sa paligid).  Kahit yung sinabi ni tito ****** nun itfucked me up really bad, i try not to think about it and say alam natin rason but it made me think really much about it. And me not being able to be around you much doesn‚Äôt also help with that impression and that‚Äôs also on me.

I‚Äôm really probably not the one. Yun na talaga pakiramdam ko ngayon, na sinasabi mo nalang na ganto ganyan kasi ayaw mo magfail tong first relationship mo. I‚Äôm always the one asking or atleast beg for another chance but never sayo nanggaling. Convenient lang ako inthe sense na, it just happened na i liked and love you but it was not the same for you, i think. You liked the idea of us of me in the past or atleast the future pero never the current- madalas. I‚Äôve never been embarrassed about you sa kahit aling stage nung career mo, nakita mo naman siguro how I was there. Now, i‚Äôm here nakikita ko na if i don‚Äôt rise up from my current station i‚Äôll be treated less and i know nobody wants a burden like me around. Maybe i‚Äôm just here until makahanap kana ng better choice than me kasi the way you act seems you open yourself as someone single( yes pinakilala mo ko sa family and friends and some coworkers but di nagaalign actions mo most of the time sa sinasabi mo) so how can i believe that. And everytime sinasabi mong nahihiya ka, i feel like a bad person for saying my side. Di ko din alam ano gagawin ko sa hiya mo, as if i am obliged to apologize for making you feel that way.üòî

If ganto nadin lang mas maganda siguro magbreak nalang tayo. It‚Äôs better na maging single kanalang for real talaga than posing like that kesa maghintay ako na makahanap ka ng better choice na pwede mo nakong palitan. I‚Äôd rather acknowledge the fact na di talaga ako yun eh ü•π kasi kung ako talaga yun i wouldn‚Äôt feel like this, i even tried to tell myself na baka oa or overthinking lang ako pero hindi eh nagbigay ako ng time, 4 years is enough to tell. I‚Äôve been in hidden and abusive relationships and I can tell when something doesn‚Äôt sit right by now. It‚Äôs better to do right by us. I want us to be with someone that they actually like or love and not someone na convenient choice lang. someone that they are proud of no matter how they are doing. Someone na nakakasama natin sana sa mga family events etc or atleast they aren‚Äôt afraid to show off nor be embarrassed about or atleast be comfortable around their financials. Thank you for being a good and caring bf, it‚Äôs just that mismatched lang siguro tayo kaya we get hurt unintentionally. We owe it to ourselves to find the right happiness for us.

I am still in love with you but I believe that if you really love someone you want to see them happy kahit di ikaw yung talagang makakapagpasaya sakanya(and i mean you). Setting aside all the other sad things, I only have gratitude, respect and appreciation for what you‚Äôve put into our relationship. I‚Äôve come to realize that we both deserve better than what we settle for now. I know I wasn‚Äôt the right gf for you and as much as i don‚Äôt want to think about it anymore, i wasn‚Äôt enough to make you that happy. I‚Äôve been blessed with so much love and care from you and i also want to return that pero sabi ko nga nakikita ko naman na mukhang di ako yung hinahanap mo. So, i decided na i‚Äôm at this point in my life na time‚Äôs too short to settle - i don‚Äôt want to be someone else‚Äôs convenient option, i want to be THE choice. I hope you meet someone that you‚Äôll willingly do things for without them asking or be proud to show them off and not be embarrassed seeing with them. Accepting them as they are or atleast sana this time yung pasok na sa gusto mo so they won‚Äôt have to think twice about themselves. I hope you find your right match at happiness. Also you‚Äôre doing well now, you won‚Äôt have to shrink approaching other girls since mas secured kana. I‚Äôm proud sa naachieve mo, i hope i can be as successful as you and more. 

*** context LDR, i‚Äôm not in a stable portion in my life no job still with parents and while he i could say upgraded to a certain degree, i loved the guy even in his low eras. this was the break up message. Update, kala ko maayos pa but after a day or 2, and after that last usap, may narinig pa ko and i lost it fully, then and there i realized it was a running joke and i am the joke. ü•¥ exactly this emoji di ko alam if tatawa ko gano karidiculous yung narinig ko ‚Äî kaya daw di daw niya ko pinost ever kasi cringe daw siya sa relationship pics ng ibang tao what more pa daw if kami and if magpost daw siya baka iset niya to only me‚Ä¶ my mind went fuck this. I don‚Äôt deserve this. Ig mo puno ng ibang babae sa pic not even gf, friends sure but coworkers?? Ni softlaunch pic na atleast ay eto pala gf wala bes. You guys may say private but there‚Äôs a difference between private and being embarrassed to be with someone passively. If mahal ka nun he will find ways to make it up to you. Antanga teh sobra. It hurts a lot kasi di sa dinedefend ko siya pero it wasn‚Äôt bad but once I heard that idc anymore if you date other people agad or who‚Äôs after or you cheated or not i don‚Äôt give a flying fuck pero i am still grieving, i just don‚Äôt show because that‚Äôs how i am. You may not see me cry but I really do and struggle especially recalling the 4 years.. never build a man for someone, kaya narerealize ko yung never go for guys who are struggling or not stable, go for someone well off than you or the same financial mindset or principles as you, it‚Äôs a harsh reality but once they upgrade especially if mas angat sayo na, nagsisilabasan mga red flags. Nobody deserves to beg for love, yes love is not enough you need to choose them but it‚Äôs easy to say that compared to what your actions show. i just need that to get off my chest.

I was so hopeful it would change my life!! But I took my first 20mg of elvanse yesterday and hated it. 

Taking it felt like drinking coffee, which I don‚Äôt do, because it makes me feel odd. 

The effects were: felt energetic and motivated for about an hour, but not motivated to sit in front my computer and do work. Instead, motivated to go out and do stuff. Then I felt nervy, foggy, nauseous and mildly headachey for the rest of the day. 

I slept fine though!

I‚Äôve read that ADHD meds don‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt really have it and now I‚Äôm feeling like a fake again. 

And I‚Äôm so disappointed that I hate the meds!!

1geotfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifecoaching4u/comments/1geotfn/how_to_bring_intimacy_back_into_a_relationship/,How to Bring Intimacy Back into a Relationship?,"We‚Äôve all heard that relationships go through phases, and one of the most challenging shifts can be the loss of intimacy. Whether it's emotional or physical, the distance can feel overwhelming, especially when you miss the closeness you once had.

If you‚Äôre feeling that gap in your relationship, you‚Äôre not alone, and there are ways to reconnect. Intimacy is like a delicate dance between two people, and even if you‚Äôve lost the rhythm, you can always find it again. Let‚Äôs talk about how you can bring intimacy back into your relationship in a loving, thoughtful way. üíñ

# Rediscover Each Other Through Small Acts of Affection üå∏

Sometimes, the problem isn't that the love has faded; it's that the little things have been forgotten. A small touch on the arm, a kiss on the forehead, or holding hands while walking these simple gestures are the threads that weave intimacy into everyday life.

When life gets busy, especially with work or kids, these moments often get pushed aside. But here‚Äôs the truth: intimacy doesn‚Äôt always have to be grand gestures or passionate nights; it‚Äôs about the daily actions that remind you both, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you.‚Äù*

Start small. Instead of focusing on the *‚Äúbig picture‚Äù* of what‚Äôs missing, focus on being affectionate in ways that feel natural. Leave them a sweet note, surprise them with their favorite coffee, or give them a random hug during the day. These moments build trust and rekindle the bond between you. üíï

# Talk About It ‚Äì Openly and Gently üí¨

I get it talking about the lack of intimacy can be awkward. But avoiding the conversation won‚Äôt solve anything. Your partner may not even realize there‚Äôs an issue, or they might be feeling the same way but are afraid to bring it up. Communication is the key to restoring intimacy.

Start by talking about how you‚Äôve been feeling without sounding accusatory. Instead of saying, *‚ÄúYou never want to be intimate anymore,‚Äù* try, ‚Äú*I miss being close to you, and I‚Äôve been feeling a little distant. Can we talk about it?‚Äù*

By opening the door to a gentle, loving conversation, you can both express your needs and start understanding where things have changed. It‚Äôs amazing how simply talking about something can relieve tension and create a pathway for positive change. üôå

# Create New Shared Experiences ‚ú®

Intimacy isn‚Äôt just built in the bedroom it‚Äôs also about emotional closeness. One way to reignite that spark is to create new experiences together. Try something you‚Äôve never done before as a couple.

Whether it‚Äôs a weekend getaway, a cooking class, or even just a long walk in a different part of town, the novelty will allow you both to see each other in a new light.

When you do something fun and different together, you remind yourselves why you fell in love in the first place. Plus, shared experiences create memories that strengthen your emotional bond. Who knows, these moments might lead to spontaneous laughter or deep conversations, helping you both feel more connected. üåü

# Physical Intimacy Starts With Emotional Intimacy üíû

If the physical side of intimacy has dwindled, it‚Äôs important to nurture emotional closeness first. Sometimes, we focus so much on the lack of physical intimacy that we forget to check in emotionally. When was the last time you had a heart-to-heart conversation about your dreams, fears, or even just how your day went?

To bring physical intimacy back, focus on rebuilding that emotional foundation. Be present with your partner, listen without distractions, and show empathy toward their thoughts and feelings. When emotional intimacy is strong, the physical aspect often follows naturally.

Reassure each other that it‚Äôs okay to take small steps, and be patient with the process. Trust takes time to rebuild, but when you invest in emotional closeness, the physical connection will grow too. üíó

Thank you for reading this far, and remember that every relationship is different. If you're finding it challenging to navigate these changes alone, seeking professional help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Therapists or relationship counselors can offer valuable tools to help both of you reconnect. It's okay to ask for help. üòäüí™

# Reignite Passion by Being Vulnerable üíñ

We often put up walls when intimacy fades, making it harder to reconnect. Vulnerability is the key to tearing those walls down. Allow yourself to be seen by your partner in your rawest, most authentic form. Share your worries, fears, and desires, and encourage them to do the same.

Being vulnerable can be scary, especially if you‚Äôve been hurt before, but it‚Äôs the pathway to a deeper connection. When you open up, your partner is more likely to do the same, allowing both of you to grow closer.

It might be uncomfortable at first, but vulnerability is where true intimacy is born. It shows trust, and when you can trust each other with your deepest selves, that connection will flourish. üåπ

# Conclusion: Take the Journey Back Together üíë

Bringing intimacy back into a relationship isn‚Äôt a one-person job. It takes both partners actively working together to rebuild the connection. Be patient with yourselves and each other.

There will be times when it feels like you‚Äôre not moving forward but remember, every little step counts. Intimacy is a journey, not a destination. üåà

By showing affection in small ways, having open conversations, creating new experiences, nurturing emotional intimacy, and allowing vulnerability, you can reignite the spark.

Relationships evolve, and sometimes you need to rediscover each other. But the beautiful thing is that love can grow even deeper when you‚Äôre both committed to nurturing it. üíï

Stay strong, be patient, and take it one step at a time. Your relationship is worth it. ü•∞

But we work professionally together on video content for her business and were amazing friends before dating. So I still wanted to hold my end of the deal and work professionally and not have any drama or emotions attached when collaborating. Which was hard but we made it work. About 4 weeks after breaking up, she asks me as a last ditch effort if I can watch her dog while she is away for the weekend at a music festival. (Mind you she and I are very much still texting all day every day and flirting but have not engaged in anything physical not even a kiss or holding hands. We had a lot of conversations about working on ourselves to be back together soon and lots of emotional support for one another, and no talk of anyone talking or dating anyone else.) I said yes to watching her dog because I thought she would do the same if I needed something like that. The night before she leaves for the festival I get a call from her at midnight saying she wants me to come over to hook up. It was very tempting and I almost caved then but ended up staying home (and having phone sex lol). The next day she leaves on friday and comes back Monday. We talked a lot less than when we usually would when she would leave town, and that worried me but we weren‚Äôt dating so. I come over monday night and we have the best dinner and time together. I end up sleeping over and she initiates sex and I felt like we were at the best place over the last month of being apart. I wake up she makes coffee and I go to work. Nothing out of the ordinary. Not even 48 hours later she tells me she met someone at the festival and is going to dinner with him, but it‚Äôs just friend vibe. I said i‚Äôm giving you the space to be for real with me what is this, do you have interest past this or is it truly ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. And assured me it‚Äôs just friend. I was extremely wary bc she hid him from me and told me on wednesday and not when she got back. She then says she will call me after. And she doesn‚Äôt. I talk to her in the morning and she said she kissed him and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt expect‚Äù to be as connected to him. Tells me she only wants to be friends with me and work professionally and creatively and says she needs to explore other people and connections. Why would she initiate sex with me when she was hiding meeting this guy while I watched her dog? Why wouldn‚Äôt she just be truthful with me and herself when I gave her the space to be. Why does she act like it‚Äôs not messed up that she hid him from me, had sex with me, 48 hrs later tells me it‚Äôs just friends vibe, switches completely 180, and then tells me she needs to seek other people and we are done romantically but will still be friends and professional.

1geomyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1geomyi/wife_wants_hugs_and_cuddles_but_nothing_more/,Wife wants hugs and cuddles but nothing more,"Throwaway account, HLM, 42, married to a LLF (37) for 13 yrs.

Initial 10 yrs of our marriage have mostly been long distance. Living together for past 3 yrs now. Wife claims she loves me. She takes good care of the household, kids etc. She works 2-3 hrs a day and is in very good physical health. I work full time from home. I'm decent looking if not great.

The issue is that she never ever initiates ANYTHING sexual, not even a proper kiss. On the other hand, she wants hugs, caressing and pampering esp. when she's trying to sleep. But that's it, nothing more. She will either ignore or oppose my advances. According to her, once a month is ""enough"". Beyond this, she may still ""allow"" me to do it but that feels more like masturbating into a rubber doll. Even this duty sex is not more than once a week or 10 days.

Earlier years too she was unwilling but was less vocal against it.

A couple of times I find myself attempting when she's asleep and then she wakes up in the middle of act. She may not always oppose but all that makes me feel really disgusted about myself.

I am kind of forced to get into porn & masturbation, and then feel even worse about myself afterwards.

I am sick of all this, really. And no, I do not want to hug her or call her cute names as she demands. She wants us to be like those lovebirds she sees whole day on Instagram reels etc.

And no, I'm not that bossy husband who simply makes her do all the housework or mistreats her. I'm jovial with kids, friends etc. Even with her I try to be fun all times. I am definitely good in bed, she herself says that whenever she's not faking it (yeah I can make out). I earn well, help her in every way possible and we do go for coffee dates etc at least 2-3 times a month. The intellectual connect is not there though, as she's not into any serious or deep discussions. In general I see no intellectual effort from her side on any topic. 

After all these years, i've grown very bitter. Love and respect is long gone from my side. She knows it but gives a damn. 

Multiple attempts of talking, convincing, begging, threatening have all failed to make her understand my needs. Doesn't agree for therapy. One of her close female friends is a reputed clinical psychologist. My wife claims that according to her she is ""just normal"" and our relationship is ""doing great"" (adding insult to injury)!

According to my wife the problem is only from my side and ""I can never be happy"". Esp when ""other couples"" are coping up with ""much worse"".

Is it really me who's got issues? I don't know why isn't my libido dying down. I even feel like asking a doctor if there is a medicine to kill it. Bcoz it's really spoiling everything for me.

1geogrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1geogrk/grindr_story/,Grindr story,"It was a random night when i opened my grindr, not to hook up but like to chat somebody anonymously since i was tired from school. May nakita akong hot na guy and ofc blurred yung face or cropped like i forgot na and i was just focusing on his body, maputi, buff and hinde ma-abs and ma-chest, literal na type ko. So i messaged him saying ‚Äútrade, i send first‚Äù so sinend ko album ko and ang tagal bago mag reply but not really long pero matagal. Then i was shock kasi kilala nyako, he said ‚Äú(my full name)??‚Äù And i was like do you know me? Tas sabi nya yes and he told me his name and sinend nya album nya and OMFG. Ex sya ng ex friend ko. 

To give u a back story, i had this friend in a toxic relationship and puro cheating chuchubels. One day, yung bf ng ex friend ko ( lets call him vincent ) messaged me na galit kasi baket daw kami nag lalaro ng ML together ng friend ko something like that and cheater daw friend ko. And ako like hold up, labas ako sa relationship nyo and wala lang naman saken yung paglalaro namin ng ML so it‚Äôs not a big deal. Tapos ayon nag away kami and we blocked each other sa socials after namin magsagutan. 

Fast forward sa araw na nag grindr ako and nakamatch ko sya. We are laughing at hinde kami makapaniwala and we had the time to explain ourselves sa both side namin and he told me na the reason why he is really really angry at me kasi apparently my friend is using me as an cheating accessory, like to make him jealous. Eh ako very go with the flow lang naman ako lagi as long as for me it was innocent things and walang masama sa ginagawa. Then ayon he told me break na sila ng ex friend ko and ayon ang blinock ko naman ngayon is yung friend ko that‚Äôs why ex friend na sya plus like i told vincent kasi na ‚Äúalam mo ba na chinat ako ng jowa mo na kung pwede saken sya matulog kasi wala syang matutulugan but i declined na kasi baka magalit ka nanaman saken tas maipit ako sa away nyo huhu‚Äù then nagulat sya hinde nya daw alam yan so ayun ginagamit talaga ako ng ex friend ko para magselos si Vincent. 

We agreed to meet up and have some coffee sa nearby coffee shop sa school to make kwentuhan at to be friends at each other kasi guys, ang kwento ng friend ko about Vincent is like he‚Äôs always the bad guy but i always give the benefit of the doubt kasi di ko naman sya kilala at hinde ko pa naririnig side nya, and now na nagkita kami at nag usap, he was nice and ang sarap nya kausap at kasama like wala kang iisiping problem. 

So time pass by and we goods naman, minding our own business then all of a sudden, nagchat sya saken using business acc asking for help kasi maglalayas daw sya kasi nahuli sya ng mom na nagkita may kausap na lalake sa computer. So ako like i said very go with the flow ako and as long as walang masama, well may masama pero since sinaktan sya ng parents nya, i do get his point naman and like i always said na im always here for my friends. So i told him na here na sya mag stay as long as he wants so he stayed here for a week, nag inom kami kasi it was his coping mechanism and to forget what happened. 

When he is staying here (mag isa lang naman ako sa house kaya free din talaga yung house ko), feel ko like mag live in partners kami and ayon may nangyare since drunk kami but, wala lang naman samen yon tas because of that, we agreed na maging friends with benefits kami. 

Nung umuwi na sya sa kanila, everything‚Äôs good na and hinde sya pinagalitan ng parents nya since mas  worried sila kaysa sa galit sila sa ginawa nya. So ayun mas naging close yung bond namin tas since FWB kami, everytime umiinom kami kahit sa bar, nagkikiss kami pero walang kami. 

Tas there was this one time nag away kami, basta ayon nag away kami and like he unfollowed me sa socials nya lahat ng socials and i was like WTF? I was being a good friend lang naman ganon tas like u-unfollow moko? So ayon i explained my side sa kanya then i blocked him. He apologized for his mistakes naman and our bond grew deeper and deeper. 

Until one time, there was this guy kasi na lagi kong pinupuntahan ko sa qc. He was my friend. We had this plan kasi na since wala kaming ka date, kami mag dedate sa isat isa like it was platonic date like we used to nung new year and Christmas. So ayun merong bulletin sa 7/11 na may sticky notes na heart tas linagay namin namin namin dun at stinory ko. Everything was good naman not until nagulat ako nagstory si vincent ng letter saying na lalayo na sya saken and naka custom lang yung story so if u can read it, it was for you. Yung kanta pa is Selos dun sa gaya sa pelikula na kanta.  So nagulat ako kasi hala bat sya nag seselos? 

Yun pala, he already liked me na pala not just as a friend or FWB but like crush na. I was shocked kasi ako confused kasi kasi i was contemplating if do i liked him ba or i just like the feeling na parang mag live in parters kami? So ayun nafifeel ko nga na lumalayo sya saken. Pag nagkikita kami with friends, hinde na ako yung una nyang binabati or hinde nya na ako maayado ina-awknowledge. 

Syempre nag tampo ako then one night i was drunk and messaged him na baket ganon nakakatampo kasi dati pag chinachat ko sya ang bilis nya mag reply ngayon hinde na, tapos lumalayo sya saken ganon. Tas ayon nagkausap kami ulit and sabi nya sama ako sa bday ng mommy sya sa quezon prov kasi mag swiswimming daw so to make up with me kasi nga diba nagtampo me sa kanya para daw hinde na me magtampo sa kanya. 

So pumunta me. Meron isang guy na nag jojokan sila about magjowa sila and what tas ako, im bothered and jealous ganon. So the entire trip going to quezon prov is badtrip ako. Umulan pa so basa kami sa likod ng pick up. Then mas napikon pako kasi im thinking na ‚Äúano ba tong bebe ni vincent di manlang ipahiram sa kanya yung cap nya para hinde mabasa ulo nya‚Äù so ako nalang nagpahiram ng cap at twalya sa kanya para hinde sya lamigin at magkasakit. So ayon nung pagka punta namin sa beach, sinuyo ako ni Vincent (HAHAHA kinikilig ako pag naaalala ko) tas ayon he said na friend lang pala nya yung guy and ganon daw talaga sila mag joke. So ako nagselos ako for nothing hahahaha lol. So ayon our trip went well naman and it was perfect and super saya kasi walwal until sunrise ganon na kami lang natirang umiinom kasi ansaya naming dalawa, played volleyball with him kahit masugatsugatan sya sa bato. Basta ang perfect ng araw na yon.

So ayun pauwi na kami, and idk bakit sobrang lungkot ko, nasa likod kami ng pick up. Hinde ako mapakali and super lumbay talaga ako. Para akong sine-sepanx. Then ayun pala i stared catching feelings with him din. I told him na hinde ako sinesepanx sa tao and pag sinepanx ako, alam kong mahal ko na yung tao. So i stared to court Vincent and we are dating and everything is so perfect. 

Now, im happy in our  relationship. Lagi syang andito sa house, but now, hinde na dahil naglayas sya. Dahil mag jowa na kami and ka-close nya na din mga tao dito sa compound here san ako nakatira and mga fam ko here sa compound hahahaha.

EXCEPT for the neighbor's and their kids. They're children are always out front never attended, and constantly doing things they shouldn't be. 

It came to a head last week. Fiance works at 4am and was trying to fall asleep around 7. But couldn't because they were right on our porch screaming and playing. No biggie, he goes out to let them know they need to go play somewhere else. Literally 10 feet either direction so their voices didn't carry into our room. They got mad but he ignored the attitude and went back inside. Until he hears them telling other kids (not quietly) to get on our porch because we'll ""come out and yell at them"". So he goes out and explains again more annoyed, that no, no one is allowed on our porch, he is trying to sleep. They go back and forth, the kids getting more mad and cursing at him, he finally says ""stay the fuck off my porch"". They act like we've killed them. Keep in mind this is a 11 and a 12 year old who scream the n word at any time of day. 

They're parents come out and start screaming that we can't talk to their children like that and that they're gonna kill us and ask what we said to their kids. 

Another neighbor had to yell out ""he told them several times to get off our porch"". 

YESTERDAY. I'm out shopping for groceries and he calls me and tells me I NEED to tell him when I get home (I walk and was walking the things I bought back). Turns out he came home from work and was on our porch breathing after his 30 minute bike ride home and the neighbors kid went screaming ""mom dad he's looking at me"". And to be fair he was looking at the kid, because the kid was unattended throwing sticks into the street for cars to run over. 

Same thing happens, dad comes out and screams asking wtf he's doing. They go back and forth before the other guy gets pissed and leaves then comes back with a crowbar. Gets even more pissed my boyfriend won't go down the stairs to fight him. 

All of this is in front of his children. 

What do I do? I should be allowed to sit outside and drink my coffee but I can't do that anymore. I use to spend hours drawing murals and stuff out of chalk on my porch and I dont do that anymore either.

# [Click here for the newest dry fasting protocols for different diets and strategies](https://www.dryfastingclub.com/)

üí°I wrote this article in one sitting, it's not as comprehensive as I would like but I have been discussing this a lot with people in the last few days so I thought I'd write something quickly so you can go deeper and explore it for yourself or chat with me about it.¬†*I may still have to jump into this article over the next few days to add/edit some parts.*

In the quest for optimal health, we often overlook the profound connections within our own bodies. Two organs, the heart and the thyroid, play pivotal roles not just individually but in how they interact with each other. Understanding this relationship is key to unlocking a higher level of well-being. Today, we'll delve into the intricate dance between the heart and the thyroid, exploring how practices like ""carnivore/ketovore"" and dry fasting can harmonize this duo for enhanced vitality.

# The Symphony Within: Heart and Thyroid

Our bodies are masterpieces of intricate systems working in unison. The heart, our life-sustaining pump, tirelessly circulates blood, delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to every cell. The thyroid gland, though small and often overlooked, is a powerhouse that regulates metabolism, energy production, and overall hormonal balance.

When these two organs are in sync, we experience optimal health‚Äîsteady energy levels, a robust metabolism, and a resilient cardiovascular system. However, when there's discord, symptoms manifest that can significantly impact our quality of life.

# Thyroid Hormones: The Metabolic Regulators

The thyroid produces hormones like thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which are crucial for regulating metabolism. These hormones influence how fast or slow our heart beats, how efficiently we burn calories, and how effectively our bodies utilize energy.

An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can lead to a sluggish metabolism, weight gain, and a slow heart rate. On the other hand, an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can cause a rapid heartbeat, weight loss, and anxiety. The balance of thyroid hormones is, therefore, essential for heart health.

üí°23 million Americans are on levothyroxine? That's synthetic t4 thyroid hormone. Very crazy! Considering I would never want to take synthetic t4. Prior to world war II, all thyroid issues used to be resolved with dessicated thyroid (pig or beef). You're missing out on T2, T1, and calcitonin (crazy).

# The Heart: More Than a Pump

The heart does more than just circulate blood; it's a responsive organ that reacts to hormonal signals, emotional states, and physiological changes. Thyroid hormones directly affect the heart's function:

* **Heart Rate and Rhythm**: Thyroid hormones influence the speed and strength of heartbeats.
* **Blood Pressure Regulation**: They help maintain vascular resistance and blood pressure stability.
* **Cholesterol Levels**: Thyroid function affects lipid metabolism, influencing cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk.

An imbalance in thyroid hormones can lead to arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension, and an increased risk of heart disease.

Important information to piece the puzzle together and another indicator that you need your thyroid health in place during fasts, whereas over-fasting can indeed make this worse, which will make you weaker in the long run and may affect the heart muscle (we don't want that!)

# Dry Fasting: Rebalancing the System

Dry fasting, the practice of abstaining from both food and water for specific periods, can be a powerful tool for resetting and rebalancing the body's systems. While it may seem extreme, when done correctly and safely, dry fasting can promote autophagy, reduce inflammation, and enhance hormonal balance.

üí°A few connections to thyroid health and fasting: Carbs help thyroid.¬†**Carbohydrates are an essential energy source for all your cells, including your thyroid cells**. Not eating enough carbohydrates impacts thyroid hormone production, conversion, and regulation. This doesn't mean go overboard. If you're already ill and looking to dry fasting, it most likely means you are not able to metabolize carbs properly and overdoing it can cause a lot of complications. I wouldn't mess with too much iodine, which can exacerbate a lot of problems and induce possible hyper thyroidism.

# How Dry Fasting Affects the Thyroid and Heart

1. **Enhanced Autophagy**: Dry fasting accelerates the body's natural cleansing process, removing damaged cells and promoting cellular regeneration. This can improve thyroid function by eliminating dysfunctional thyroid cells and supporting healthy hormone production.
2. **Hormonal Reset**: Fasting influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, which can help recalibrate hormone levels. This reset can alleviate symptoms of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism.
3. **Reduced Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation is a common thread in many thyroid disorders and heart diseases. Dry fasting has been shown to reduce inflammatory markers, easing stress on both the thyroid and the heart.
4. **Improved Insulin Sensitivity**: Fasting enhances insulin sensitivity, aiding in metabolic efficiency. A well-functioning metabolism supports thyroid health and reduces cardiovascular strain.
5. **Blood Pressure and Cholesterol**: Regular dry fasting can help normalize blood pressure and lipid profiles, decreasing the risk of heart disease.

üí°In a perfect world you would take thyroid and adrenal bloodwork prior to dry fasting and hormone therapy so that you could establish a baseline. This would allow you to check up in a few months to see what it is actually doing. A lot of people can't afford this so my best advice to you is to approach it intuitively and feel it out. This is not medical advice, it's simply what I would do if I gave up on the medical establishment or did not have the opportunity to use it correctly.  
  
**Side note:**¬†There are ways to navigate narcissitic and ""uneducated"" doctors to get the testing you need, and then have someone more well versed in \[root causes\] analyze it and give you reocmmendations.

# Why Adrenals need to be taken into consideration too

Long-term hypothyroidism doesn't just slow down your metabolism‚Äîit puts a significant strain on your adrenal glands. When your thyroid isn't producing enough hormones, your body compensates by over-relying on the adrenals to keep you going. This constant demand can lead to adrenal fatigue, where the adrenals become burned out and can't function properly. It's a critical connection that's often missed: the more the thyroid underperforms, the more the adrenals are pushed to their limits, trying to supply that missing energy.

Regulating and healing your adrenals is essential before thyroid hormone therapy can truly be effective. If your adrenals are depleted, introducing thyroid hormones might not only be unhelpful‚Äîit could make you feel worse. By focusing on restoring adrenal health first, you create a foundation that allows thyroid treatments to work as intended. Once both your thyroid and adrenals are balanced, you're in a better position to explore fasting and other health strategies to further enhance your well-being.

Once both your thyroid and adrenals are balanced, you're in a better position to explore fasting and other health strategies to further enhance your well-being.

üí°If you are adrenal fatigued, I want you to remember to slow your way into fasting. The other key to building a fasting lifestyle for those who are adrenal fatigued is making sure you increase your good fat. You will want to stabilize your blood sugar to make fasting easier.¬†*This is why I recommend most severely sick chronic illness suffers to get on the low carb diet which will make the fasts possible.*  
  
The worst thing someone with adrenal fatigue could do when they fast is eat a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet; this will make fasting incredibly hard, if not impossible. Remember, for you we want surges of hormetic stress, but not too much stress.  
  
How do you know if youre suffering adrenal issues and not thyroid? Coffee really messes you up. You are always tired. Etc.

# Points for Consideration with the Thyroid

* **Prioritize Quality Proteins**: After fasting (but mostly once you gradually re-awaken your digestive organs), consume high-quality proteins from sources like grass-fed meats and wild-caught fish to support thyroid hormone production.
* **Carbs are required to supply energy to the brain and thyroid**¬†(the brain needs glucose and can't run on just ketones). Low-carb diets have been shown to reduce T3 levels. Just don't go crazy on carbs. Carbs also lower the need for adrenals to be pumping (very important).
* **Include Healthy Fats**: Fats from avocados, olive oil, and omega-3-rich foods aid in hormone synthesis and reduce inflammation.
* **Limit Goitrogens**: Be cautious with foods that can interfere with thyroid function, such as soy and certain cruciferous vegetables, especially if consumed raw.
* **Stress Management**: Chronic stress disrupts hormonal balance. Practices like meditation, deep breathing, and gentle yoga can alleviate stress.
* **Regular Physical Activity**: Engage in moderate exercise to boost cardiovascular health and support metabolic function.
* **Adequate Sleep**: Prioritize sleep to allow the body to repair and regulate hormones effectively.

üí°**Autoimmune Disorders:**¬†I would be remiss not to mention autoimmune issues. With long covid you can be hit with a ton of autoimmune issues. For example: Hashimoto's Disease is an autoimmune condition that attacks the thyroid. I'd wager there is a big chance Chronic Fatigue illnesses encompass some aspect of this built-in. Dry fasting gives us an opportunity to try to reverse some of this, but with an already weakened thyroid, adding zero carbs and fasting can weaken it more. I'd like for you to consider therapies for the thymus when it comes to autoimmunity. I've played and researched a bit with peptides such as thymulin. I recommend you look into it. If you work with me, we can go deeper on this too. There's also supplements like beef thymus which is a natural way to try and target the immune system, T cell production and autoimmune issues. Of course there's a ton of other strategies that you can consider, such as healthy human breastmilk (yikes). I almost don't want to write about this because babies do need it, but I would love for Elon Musk technological developments to advance to such a stage where we have access to a bio-identical peptide formulation in the future. One can only hope these alternative, powerful naturopathic option development does not get stifled by the censorship of the left wing media/ government.

# Final Reflections

Our modern lifestyles often disconnect us from natural rhythms, leading to hormonal imbalances and health issues. Dry fasting is a practice that can help us realign with these rhythms, giving the body a chance to heal and restore.

By embracing periods of rest from constant consumption, we allow the thyroid and heart to recalibrate. This doesn't just alleviate symptoms but addresses root causes, promoting long-term health.

>I often talk to people who have cured 'heart pain' following long covid or vaccination-induced complications by extended fasting, which means there are more mechanisms at play than just the thyroid. So keep that in mind.

The connection between the heart and the thyroid is a testament to the body's interconnectedness. By understanding and respecting this relationship, we can take proactive steps to enhance our health.

Dry fasting, when approached mindfully, offers a pathway to rejuvenation and balance. It's not just about abstaining from food and water; it's about embracing a holistic approach to well-being.

Remember, your health journey is personal. What works for one may not work for another. Always honor your body's signals and seek guidance when needed. Good luck on your dry fasting journey.
