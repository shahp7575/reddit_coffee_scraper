Thoughtful interior design blends style with functionality, making spaces more inviting, efficient, and inspiring. Whether you're planning a complete renovation or making subtle enhancements, these innovative ideas will help you transform your home into a sanctuary of comfort and style.

# Layered Lighting for Mood and Depth

Lighting is often overlooked, yet it plays a crucial role in setting the ambience of a home. Move beyond basic overhead lighting by layering direct, indirect, and ambient light sources. Backlit wall panels and LED strips under furniture add warmth, while dim-to-warm bulbs adjust the colour temperature throughout the day, simulating natural light for a soothing effect.

# Architectural Paint Techniques for Dimension

Go beyond conventional accent walls and experiment with shadow gradients, ombré finishes, or Venetian plaster to add depth and texture. A bold statement can be achieved by painting the ceiling in a contrasting shade, instantly making the space feel more dynamic and visually engaging.

# Modular Seating for Functionality and Style

Modular seating options are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional. A well-designed seating arrangement can refresh a living space, and it tends to create a welcoming and practical social point. Choosing sleek modular seating options helps you avoid visual clutter yet enhances comfort. It also offers versatility and usability in urban homes with limited space.

# Multi-Functional Partitioning for Flexible Spaces

Traditional walls can make spaces feel smaller and rigid. Instead, opt for bookshelves that combine storage as well as visual separation or intelligent-tinted glass partitions. Reeded or fluted glass provides a balance of privacy and openness, allowing light to flow seamlessly through the space.

# Revised- Flexible Spaces with Intelligent Design

Instead of typical rigid layouts, explore adaptable furniture and design solutions that enable convenient shifts from one use of a space to another use. Sliding panels and unique shelf designs can give a sense of separateness without the feeling of confinement. 

# Ceilings as a Design Feature

Often overlooked, ceilings present an opportunity for creative expression. A coffered ceiling with LED uplighting adds a sense of luxury, while acoustic panels double as artistic elements that help dampen noise in open-plan areas.

# Nature-Infused Interiors for a Healthier Home

Bringing nature indoors isn’t limited to houseplants. Famed biophilic art offers a low-maintenance greenery solution, while breathable clay walls and lime-washed finishes naturally regulate humidity, enhancing air quality and comfort.

# Revised- Nature-Infused Interiors for a Healthier Home

Bringing nature indoors isn’t limited to houseplants. Framed biophilic art offers a low-maintenance greenery solution, while breathable clay walls and lime-washed finishes naturally regulate humidity, enhancing air quality and comfort.

# Statement Staircases with Functional Features

A staircase can be more than just a utility feature. Consider built-in storage, such as hidden drawers or a wine rack beneath each step. Motion-sensing LED strips under stair treads add a sleek, futuristic glow while improving safety.

# Zoning with Textures and Bespoke Nooks

Instead of using traditional dividers, subtly zone areas using textures and materials. Herringbone wood floors in the living area and terrazzo in the kitchen create a natural separation, while matte and high-gloss finishes add depth. Maximise unused corners with built-in coffee bars, reading nooks, or meditation zones.

# Transforming Interiors with Modern Developments

With these innovative interior design concepts, you can enhance both the aesthetics and functionality of your home. Whether through lighting, textures, or unique materials, each design element contributes to a sophisticated and inspiring living space. Leading developers, including Mr [Jay Goenka of Dynamix Group](https://www.facebook.com/thedynamixgroup/posts/jay-goenka-director-at-the-dynamix-group-sheds-light-on-how-the-indian-real-esta/775810259657905/), are incorporating contemporary aesthetics into projects like Parkwoods and Luma, ensuring spacious layouts, ample natural light, and modern interiors that offer the perfect canvas for homeowners to personalise their spaces.

1jk8bj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bonoss-Aria-7367/comments/1jk8bj6/ford_ranger_wheel_rubbing_how_wheel_spacers_fix/,Ford Ranger Wheel Rubbing? How Wheel Spacers Fix It & Boost Off-Road Performance,"https://preview.redd.it/ac0tegdid0re1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa9da564025daecc0c1c55f10672dc76772c16dc

For hardcore off-roaders, the quest to build a truck that conquers trails without sacrificing daily drivability is a never-ending pursuit. Enter wheel spacers—the unassuming upgrade that bridges the gap between factory limitations and overlanding ambitions. 

Specifically engineered for Ford Rangers, these precision-machined components don’t just tweak your setup; they redefine what your truck can tackle. By repositioning wheels outward, spacers deliver three non-negotiable advantages: expanded tire clearance, razor-sharp stability, and the mean, trail-ready stance that turns heads at the trailhead and the coffee shop.

**Why Wheel Spacers Matter: Key Benefits**

1. Accommodate Serious Upgrades:  
Jumbo treads and upgraded braking systems frequently battle stock suspension geometry. Quality Ranger spacers eliminate fender rub while creating vital breathing room for performance brake components.

2. Dominate Every Angle  
Extending your track width with hub-centric spacers optimizes weight distribution, increasing cornering traction and minimizing side sway during off-camber climbs. Translation? More predictable handling when the trail gets spicy.

3. Dial In Purpose-Built Proportions  
That flush fender alignment isn't just about looks - it optimizes tread contact for superior load distribution. Premium Ranger wheel spacers ensure your rig's presence matches its prowess.

4. Crack the Code on Custom Wheels  
Dealing with incompatible lug patterns? Spacers double as conversion kits, enabling aftermarket wheel installations without cutting corners on engineering integrity.

**Choosing Your Spacer Thickness: A Tactical Approach**

Selecting the right spacer isn’t a one-size-fits-all decision. Three factors dictate your ideal thickness:

​Tire Size & Suspension Geometry

* 1.25"" spacers: Ideal for mild builds running 33” tires with minimal lift. Clears most rubbing issues while preserving OEM-like handling.
* 1.5""-2"" spacers: The sweet spot for 35”+ tires and mid-travel suspension kits. Balances aggressive spacing with minimal stress on wheel bearings.
* 2.5""+ spacers: Reserved for specialized rigs with custom long-travel setups. Requires reinforced hubs and frequent bearing inspections.

​Material Matters: Aerospace-Grade vs. Budget

* Billet aluminum (6061-T6 or 7075-T6):  The gold standard for strength-to-weight ratios. Resists corrosion, handles impact forces, and lasts through years of abuse.
* Cast aluminum:  Lighter on the wallet but prone to microfractures under heavy loads. Suitable for pavement princesses, not rock crawlers.

​Hub-Centric Design: Non-Negotiable

Cheap spacers with universal lug-centric designs invite vibrations and uneven wear. Always opt for hub-centric models that lock onto your Ranger’s factory hubs for flawless alignment.

**The Bottom Line**

Wheel spacers aren’t a Band-Aid fix—they’re a strategic upgrade that amplifies your Ranger’s inherent capabilities. Whether you’re chasing Trophys on technical trails or building a weekend warrior that dominates fire roads, these components deliver measurable performance gains without breaking the bank. 

In the off-road world, where every millimeter of clearance and every degree of stability counts, wheel spacers prove that sometimes, the smallest additions make the biggest impact.

Your Ford Ranger was born for adventure. It’s time to equip it like it.

Hi all, so this is supposed to be the first chapter of a story I have planned around F1 in the 90s, with some characters loosely based on real-life drivers (I'll let you guess who.) I was experimenting with third-person POV, because I was thinking of alternating chapters between Harry and Alex's third-person POV. I'm not sure how that turned out here, so I'd appreciate some thoughts about that.

I posted a story writing from Harry's first-person POV but I didn't really vibe with that. If you're not very familiar with motor racing, some terms may be confusing, so let me know and I can add footnotes on my story. Thank you!

**Autodromo do Estoril, February 23, 1995.**

Harry Thomas had been here before.

The hubbub of pre-season testing, the mountains of data brought by the engineers, the excitement of putting the new car through its paces, the evenings spent outside soaking up every moment of Portugal’s mild winter before returning home to rainy old England.  
  
What he had \*not\* done before, though, was go into pre-season testing as the reigning world champion.  
  
Even though it had been a few months since he lifted the coveted trophy back in Suzuka, it still didn’t feel real. Strangers would stop him on the street to shake his hand and he hadn’t paid for a pint in a pub since his victory. English people needed someone, \*anyone\* to cheer for, and it surely wasn’t going to be their sorry excuse for a football team.  
  
The joy of the experience was clouded slightly with Harry’s revulsion at seeing pictures of him plastered everywhere: on magazine covers, newspaper front pages, Marlboro advertisements, you name it. He was sure that the people of England were sick to death of him, because God only knows, he was sick of smiling in front of the cameras.  
  
Truth was, Harry just wanted to be an ordinary sort of bloke, the kind who could catch the Tube unnoticed and blend into the background at a gathering. He was an ordinary bloke in his teens and early twenties, when he was borderline destitute, and some days, he almost longed for that anonymity again.  
  
“Coffee, mate?”  
  
Behind Harry stood Tom Whittaker, his race engineer. Tom was in his fifties, with graying hair and a slight beer gut. He’d been with Harry since the latter entered Formula One five years ago, and both being rather reserved Englishmen, shared a special bond as driver and engineer. They both disliked idle small talk and sometimes sat in complete silence, communicating in what seemed like telepathic ways to outsiders.  
  
“Thanks, mate.” Harry took the styrofoam cup of coffee from Tom and practically inhaled it in one gulp. The bitter aftertaste made him wrinkle his face in disgust. “Shit. With all the money McLaren makes, you’d think they’d provide us with better coffee.”  
  
“Take it up with Ron in the next meeting, then.” Tom muttered wryly.  
  
“Suppose I could. You think Prost would ever drink this shit? \*Bleh\*.” He tossed the cup aside in disgust. Harry would never \*dream\* of making a demand out of anyone that wasn’t related to racing or seeing his family, though, so that was purely a mental exercise. “How’s your family? All okay?”  
  
“Yeah, all good, thanks. The weather in Leeds is fucking shite, though. I’m glad we’re in Portugal. You can actually see the sun for once.”  
  
“Well, it’s not too late to move to Monaco like the rest of us tax-evading hacks.”  
  
“While I’m at it, I might as well trade my missus in for a gorgeous blonde model with a great big arse.”  
  
“You dirty old man.” Harry snickered. “You have no— hang on, is that Alex?”  
  
The garage had fallen eerily silent as Alex Korhonen made his entrance. Everyone stopped to watch the man they were all convinced, sixteen months ago, was dead. It was, quite frankly, like seeing a ghost. The mechanics gave Alex a few muted handshakes, but most of them avoided eye contact with him.   
  
Alex looked strange. Harry squinted, trying to put his finger on why. His blond hair had grown back and there were no visible scars on his face, but he just seemed \*different\*. He was a bit pale, maybe, and he’d clearly lost a lot of muscle tone, but there was still something off.  
  
“What you all looking at? You make me nervous.” Alex tried to crack a smile, and then it clicked. Only the right corner of his mouth turned up and the left side of his face didn’t move at all. A cold shiver ran down Harry’s spine. “Come on, I show you I still fast.”  
  
“Is this his first time back in the car?” Harry whispered. Tom gave him a silent nod. “Shit. Let’s hope he can do it.”  
  
“I reckon they’ll drop him if his times aren’t good. I mean, I want to see him do well, but I’m not sure he should be racing so soon.”  
  
Harry was quiet for a moment, watching Alex put his signature blue-and-white striped helmet on and climb into the cockpit of the McLaren. “He already missed last year. If you’re out of the car for too long, I think it becomes impossible to come back.”  
  
The V10 engine of the car roared to life. Harry slapped his hands over his ears to protect whatever was left of his hearing. As Alex pulled out of the garage, Harry’s gaze remained fixed on the place the car had left empty. How could someone come so close to death and \*still\* want to risk his life racing again? If Harry had been in his shoes, he would’ve counted his lucky stars and skipped off into the sunset with his second chance. But maybe that’s what made them different.  
  
“Do you want him as your teammate?”  
  
“I don’t mind, really.” He tapped his foot on the shiny linoleum floor, a sudden feeling of unease coming over him. “I mean, we were never best mates, but he \*really\* wants to win and I can appreciate that. I’d rather have him than… oh, Alesi, for instance.”  
  
“What have you got against Alesi?” Tom chuckled.  
  
“Nothing! I mean, he’s a nice bloke. I just don’t want him as a teammate. He’s a bit \*difficult\* to work with, or so I’ve heard. A diva, maybe.”  
  
“And Korhonen isn’t?”  
  
“Well, he’s quite young, isn’t he? One of the youngest since, I dunno, the fifties? It was all over the news when he made his debut. Twenty-one when he started, so that makes him… twenty-five now?” Harry shrugged. “I was a fucking prick when I was his age, too.”  
  
“Or do you think it’s just easier to win a championship against a bloke who’s half-crippled?”  
  
“Fuck’s sake, Tom. Why would you say that?” Without realizing it, Harry had clenched both fists. “I wanna race and win against the best. And if Korhonen’s not the best, then \*give me the fucking best\*.”  
  
Tom raised an eyebrow. “Who do you think is the best, then? Weber?”  
  
“That cheater? \*Please\*.” Harry scoffed. There was a moment of awkward silence between the two men as the mood in the room soured. “You know I don’t like talking about him.”  
  
“Yeah. Sorry.” It was a rare moment of contrition from Tom, a man who was normally convinced he was \*always\* right.  
  
“No worries, mate.” Another awkward pause. “Come on, I’m starving. Let’s see what they’ve got for lunch today.”",1,1742983736.0,DestructiveReaders,0,1.0,False

1jk89vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/lazerpig/comments/1jk89vn/how_godzilla_made_trump_wearing_a_lederhosen/,How Godzilla made Trump wearing a Lederhosen.,"This literary parable is based on current events. Any similarities to living creatures are absolutely intentional and should make you cringe in disgust.

 \---

It began, as these things often do, on a Tuesday. Godzilla emerged from the Pacific Ocean, stomping ashore in Los Angeles and promptly turning Beverly Hills into a scenic lava pit. By Wednesday, Las Vegas had become a glittering crater, and by Thursday, the Grand Canyon was just slightly grander. The United States was in chaos.

President Trump declared that ""no one could have seen this coming,"" despite years of kaiju-themed conspiracy theories floating around Reddit. The Pentagon was powerless. Godzilla was immune to nukes, indifferent to tanks, and seemed to actually enjoy the taste of F-35 fighter jets. As the monster stomped its way toward the Midwest, devouring cornfields (and the occasional small town) like a scaly locust, the President turned to diplomacy.

The Germans had the Taurus missiles. Everyone knew it. Sleek, precise, and capable of ripping Godzilla a new hole into his enormous behind, they were the only weapon capable of stopping the rampage. But Chancellor Selenskji, the recently elected German leader and a man of considerable stoicism, had been reluctant to share.

“It would escalate things,” Selenskji had said in a press conference, sipping his coffee with the calm of a man whose country was not being systematically stomped flat. “We must not provoke Godzilla further. Besides, the Americans have plenty of resources. Surely they can handle this themselves.”

By Friday, Chicago and most of the great lakes had been turned into a boiling swamp, and Trump was desperate. 

In a hastily arranged diplomatic visit, President Trump flew to Berlin to plead for the Taurus missiles. The meeting was broadcast live, as Selenskji insisted on transparency. Trump, ever the showman, opened with his usual bravado.

“Chancellor, look, you’re a great guy. Tremendous guy. But we need those missiles. Godzilla is destroying our cities. He’s eating our farms. My golf courses are in danger. We’re willing to make a deal—whatever you want.”

Selenskji adjusted his tie, his expression one of polite disinterest. “Mr. President, I must say, I am disappointed. You come here asking for help, and yet you do not even wear the traditional Lederhosen. This is disrespectful to our culture.”

Trump blinked. “Lederhosen? What does that have to do with anything?”

“The Germans respect tradition,” Selenskji replied smoothly. “Perhaps if you had made an effort to respect ours, we could take your request more seriously. Also, where are your manners? Praise us for our great scientist which brought your helpless Astronauts to the moon. Also, buy more German cars.”

The German press chuckled. Twitter exploded with memes of Trump photoshopped into various ridiculous Lederhosen outfits. Meanwhile, Detroit was reduced to ash.

The negotiations continued, but Selenskji was unyielding. “If we are to deliver the Taurus missiles, we must first consider the cost. Perhaps America could transfer half of its national resources to Germany as a gesture of goodwill?”

“Half?” Trump sputtered. “Are you crazy? That’s... un-American!”

“It is a small price to pay for survival, no?” Selenskji replied, smiling faintly.

By this point, Godzilla had reached the East Coast. Boston was submerged in flames, and New Yorkers were fleeing in droves as the monster made its way toward Manhattan. The Statue of Liberty was now a twisted heap of molten metal, her torch barely recognizable.

Finally, Trump caved. He signed the agreement, handing over vast swaths of American oil, farmland, and manufacturing to Germany in exchange for the promise of Taurus missiles.

But things turned out differently. While America burned, Selenskji revealed that Germany had been quietly working on a solution to the Godzilla problem—a solution that did not involve missiles at all.

In a dramatic live broadcast, the world watched as German scientists unveiled their latest invention: the Godzilla Tamer 3000, a massive robotic leash designed to subdue the beast. A team of highly trained schnitzel chefs (it turned out Godzilla had a weakness for Bavarian cuisine) distracted the beast and a moment later it was on a tight leash, now docile and obedient, while it was led back into the ocean.

The world cheered. Germany had saved the day.

As the dust settled, Trump, now wearing the cutest Lederhosen, once again approached Selenskji. “So... about those Taurus missiles. Now that Godzilla’s gone, can we have them? You know, just in case...”

Selenskji raised an eyebrow. “Oh, you still want them? But they are no longer necessary. Perhaps you should have asked for our help sooner.”

Trump’s face turned red. “This is a scam! A scam, I tell you!”

Selenskji shrugged. “Perhaps. But at least you now own the greatest pair of Lederhosen.”

As the German delegation departed, Godzilla safely leashed and trailing behind them like an oversized pet, Trump was left standing in the ruins of Washington, D.C., his hands empty and his dignity in shreds.

Months later, Godzilla was spotted in Munich, performing tricks for tourists in exchange for bratwurst. America, meanwhile, struggled to rebuild, its resources gone and its reputation tarnished.

And somewhere in Berlin, Chancellor Selenskji sipped his coffee, smiling faintly as he watched a replay of Trump’s humiliation on live TV.

“I am sure,” he murmured, “he will wear those stupid Lederhosen on every meeting, just to be sure to not annoy me.”",2,1742983543.0,lazerpig,0,1.0,False

1jk87n3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jk87n3,"Keep getting 7.5-8.0 from AI, what do YOU think?","Good day, good people. so I've been practicing writing essays for writing tasks 1 and 2, but the AI keeps giving me the same notes over and over again, even if I take the suggestions and actually improve my essays.

Is there anybody who would be open to checking out my essays themselves? The tasks are attached as well:

writing task 1: The following diagram displays the floor plan of a public library 20 years ago and the changes that have occurred nowadays. Overall, the structure of the library have been rearranged in order to accommodate the needs of modern society. This has been achieved by digitalizing certain content, rearranging the book sections and capitalizing on the new ways of making profit. For instance, the CDs, videos and computer games section has been dismissed in favor of a venue for storytelling events. Additionally, the new section has been widened in order to move in the children's books section. In place of the previously located children's books section a lecture room has been established.

Moving on to the Adult fiction books section and Enquiry desk, they have been relocated to the hallway next to the lecture room so that they would share room with the self-service machines. Thus, the adult non-fiction books section has been completely eliminated. Moreover, on the premises of the old adult fiction books section a new all reference books section has been put.

As for the reading room, it has been replaced with a modern computer room, right next to which lies a cafe which has been put where the enquiry desk used to be. The new cafe have been given more space, thus removing the tables residing in the middle of the library in order to save up space.

The aforementioned changes have been implemented in order to accommodate the people's interest in fiction literature and the need of a coffee and a snack while reading, as well as to save up space and reap the benefits of the modern technology.

writing task 2:  
From the very genesis of humankind, people constantly moved places, giving preference to those locations that were prone to provide a safe, peaceful and sustainable way of life. Centuries have passed, but the tendency has remained the same. Nowadays, there is a whopping number of people who give up the rural areas that they used to call home in favor of those places that are either closer to the big cities or located within the major cities themselves. This tendency, while reflecting the positive pattern of people aspiring for a better life, has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages.

On the one hand, the influx of people floating into major cities suggests the abandonment of the rural, less financially attractive, parts of the country. The body of the moving people largely consists of people from 18 to 25 years old, the most productive age group. Thus, by deciding to move into places where they're provided with more job opportunities, they leave the rural job market empty, which leads to a staggering lack of workforce and a drop in quality of life. Additionally, this outflux upends the demographic situation in rural areas, leading to the total aging of population.

On the other hand, the tendency reflects the human desire for a better life, which everyone has a right to. This serves as a harsh wake-up call for their respective governments to draw conclusions and soundly react to this outflux in order to preclude a total demographic collapse. This may lead to such changes as developing new government programs and establishing funds for facilitating urban development, attracting major businesses in the rural areas and constructing facilities that are staple of any sustainable society, such as affordable modern housing, malls and schools.

To wrap it up, humanity has always been on a move, and the modern day escape from rural areas simply reflects the people's reaction to the overall quality of life in these places. Albeit it doesn't necessarily mean that we're about to face a total demographic crisis in the nearest future. Therefore, it's up to government to decide on the following course of action so that people wouldn't have to give up on life in their hometowns and villages in search of a better life elsewhere.",1,1742983289.0,IELTS,2,1.0,False

letter from ENT - 'Endoscopic posterior nasal neurectomy has been discussed as an additional option to address rhinitis symptoms. This reduces the parasympathetic nerve stimulus for rhinitis and involves heat treatment to the distribution of the nerve supplying the middle and inferior turbinates. This can be performed during the same time as the turbinoplasty.'

My nose is usually really congested and im really fatigued as a result of this, however whenever im in certain environments like a coffee shop or driving a car by congestion if alleviated and as a result i feel a lot more awake!

How safe is this Neurectomy done via heat treatment?? im not sure exactly what method he is talking about and will know in 2 weeks but want to be fully prepped for this meeting.

1jk85q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jk85q4/adhd_might_be_caused_by_a_problem_with_the_glue/,ADHD might be caused by a problem with the glue that sticks cells together?!,"Apologies for the very long post: this is my second attempt at starting this discussion after my first attempt didn’t make the distinction between “connective tissue” and “ligaments” clear enough and got derailed by an argument. I think it’s an interesting topic, though, so TIA for bearing with me (if you do).

Starting with a disclaimer and some definitions:

- “Connective tissue” is present throughout your body (including your brain) and is the glue that holds cells (including brain cells) together.

- “Ligaments” are a type of connective tissue that are important for joint function.

- In this post “connective tissue” refers to ALL cellular glue, including but not only “ligaments”. 

I am *not* saying hypermobility causes ADHD, or that everyone with ADHD will be very bendy. 

I *am* saying that ADHD might be caused by a subtle difference in the structure of all connective tissue in the body and that, for lots of ADHDers, that also manifests as hypermobility, Ehlers Danlos, and other joint disorders.

For me, that was a mind blowing realisation because:

A) it explains why I have so many comorbidities (I don’t have 100 things wrong with me, I have 1 thing wrong with me that has 100 symptoms 🙄) and;

B) it frankly makes the treatment of ADHD as a psychological disorder by the medical profession a complete farce. Which isn’t to says the meds don’t work or that people shouldn’t take them, but after years of being told it’s literally my “self” that’s the problem and I should be different than I am, finding it out it could actually be a problem with the glue that holds my brain cells together was revelatory.

So. After that VERY long preamble (thank you for watching, I’m here all week) here, again, is my original post:

Anyone else listen to the ADHDchatter podcast? The episode from 11/03/25 (or 03/11/25, if you prefer) blew my mind:

https://overcast.fm/+ABAPaoQqr9w

The link between ADHD (we REALLY need to change the name 🙄) and hypermobility is increasingly clear. The idea that ADHD may be caused by a difference in connective tissue structure is very compelling.

The stuff about anxiety being caused by problems with proprioception and physical information processing is interesting too 🤔

If, like me, you can’t function without two strong cups of coffee in the morning, this paper might be of interest:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8864202/

It also made me think about all the ADHD peeps that find caffeine puts you to sleep (not me!). Maybe it corrects proprioception for you and as a result the anxiety that’s “driving you like a motor” subsides enough for you to sleep?

Other helpful nuggets from the podcast:

- the connective tissue hypothesis might also explain dietary issues
- we’re at 3x higher risk of long COVID, which seems to be triggered by high inflammation. If you can, maybe explore a low inflammation diet to reduce your risk (although that’s me extrapolating a lot further than the podcast based on my own experience of my inflammation improving when I realised I’m dairy intolerant and quit it)
- Hormones are involved too, although it’s not yet clear how
- the ADHDmen in your life are also likely to have hypermobile joints and the associated health impacts, but they’re more likely to get missed because their hormone profiles are more likely to mask it

For the non-podcast listeners out there, here is the Jessica Eccles research profile: https://www.bsms.ac.uk/about/contact-us/staff/dr-jessica-eccles.aspx
And her link tree with links to all her primary research: https://linktr.ee/bendybrain?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&ltsid=d051ee00-661d-4128-a6de-3f101d5b5694

1jk81s2,https://v.redd.it/ov8zxmt220re1,I built a coffee logging tool and got my first 3 sales in a week!,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my journey of launching [BrewLog](https://brewlog.coffee), a coffee brewing journal that helps people track and improve their coffee. I made my first 3 sales this week, and I’ve learned a LOT along the way.

# How It Started

The first thing I did was set up a simple landing page where users could sign up for early access. I posted the link in a few coffee-related subreddits, explaining the idea and potential features. Within a few days, 30 people were on the waitlist!

Next, I started designing in Figma and sent out a survey to gather feedback. Once I had refined the design, I made a demo site where users could interact with the layout—although at this stage, it had no functionality.

Then, I added actual user accounts and coffee logging features. By the time I was ready to launch, I had:  
✅ 100 people on my email list  
✅ 55 people signed up for the demo

# The Launch (And My Mistakes)

I messed up my launch in a big way. I originally made BrewLog free, even though I always planned for it to be paid. I should have launched as a paid product from the start to set the right expectations.

I launched on Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker News, gaining some initial traction, for the free accounts. Then, I switched to a paid model with a big discount for early users. I also started posting on Instagram, X, and TikTok. This is something I wish I had done from day one.

For two days, nothing happened. No sales. A few confused emails. I started doubting myself and even considered quitting.

Then, I woke up to a $20 Stripe notification, my first sale! It was the most expensive option I offered (lifetime access), which gave me the confidence to keep going.

# The Grind to More Sales

A few days later, it was silent again. No new sales. I had people clicking the link, but no conversions. I started sending follow-up emails to users who had visited the sales page.

One person replied saying they had trouble with a discount code. I quickly responded, gave them a new code, and BAM, another sale!

That night, I sent one last follow-up email to someone who had clicked the sales page multiple times but never purchased (this was my 3rd follow up email, with no replies). I almost didn’t send it because it felt spammy (but youtube said to, so I did it). But I did… and at 1 AM, another sale came in!

# Lessons Learned

✅ **Doubt is normal, but don’t let it stop you.** Look at the facts, not your feelings.  
✅ **Set the right expectations early.** I should have made it clear that BrewLog would be a paid product from the start.  
✅ **Start social media early.** Growing an audience from launch day is way harder than building it in advance.  
✅ **Follow up with potential customers.** That last email got me a sale!  
✅ **Use the right tools.** I stubbornly built everything in HTML, CSS, and JS, which made the design process longer and harder to change.

# What’s Next?

I’m doubling down on **social media** and **free tools** (just launched a coffee ratio calculator & a free brew guide). If you’re interested in BrewLog (You probably aren't my target audience, but thought I'd share anyway), check it out [here](https://brewlog.coffee)!

Debts:
Latitude Card: $3000 Interest Free
HSBC Balance Transfer: $2000 Interest Free
Qantas Credit Card: $1800 due mid April. 

Total: $6800 

Car: $35k (Will be selling this car asap. Fortunately with only 5000km, it will sell for more than the debt owed. I don’t drive the car and with insurance it costs me $1000 a month which is crazy for something I don’t use for commuting)

I earn $2500-$3500 a fortnight depending on how much I am worked at work. 

Currently I am Salary Sacrificing $577 a fortnight into super to Maximise the FHSS. My most recent determination is $10,000. 

I have no cash saved and no investments outside of superannuation. 

I have been predominantly eating out, buying multiple coffees as day, been overseas 6 times in the past 2 years and buy what I want when I want, and use interest free debt to accomplish that aim if necessary. I’ve been irresponsible and allowed my first few years of professional income to enable my bad financial decisions. I am now educating myself financially with the help of this sub and other resources. 

Now I am making the big changes I need to in order to be financially free. But my main question is…

Should I withdraw my FHSS and pay off my debts? Start fresh. I’ll have to pay back 20% but i’ll still cover my debts and have some cash left over as a launch pad for my savings. Losing FHSS in the future, as a result. 

Or given they’re interest free debts for 12+ months still, should I continue with FHSS for my future property goals, and tackle the debt as hard as possible every fortnight with my paycheque?

BTC pushing into heavy resistance zones while whales quietly refill below. Something’s brewing — and not just your coffee.

⸻

Current Price: $87,910
Volume: -17% | Order Book Depth: +1%
CVD: +127 — buyers slightly in control, but momentum is fading.
The market’s calm… maybe too calm.

⸻

Sell-Side Liquidity (Limit Sells):

	•	89,600 — 155 BTC
	•	89,400 — 173 BTC
	•	89,200 — 206 BTC
	•	89,000 — 225 BTC
	•	88,800 — 172 BTC
	•	88,600 — 160 BTC
	•	88,400 — 122 BTC
→ Total: nearly 1,200 BTC stacked above
→ Resistance remains firm in the 88.4K–88.8K zone — price is trying to punch through.

⸻

Buy-Side Liquidity (Limit Buys):

	•	87,600 — 137 BTC
	•	87,400 — 211 BTC
	•	87,200 — 390 BTC
	•	87,000 — 312 BTC
	•	86,800 — 464 BTC
	•	86,600 — 332 BTC
→ Strong support cluster: 1,800+ BTC in the 86.6K–87.4K area

⸻

What’s happening?

	•	Order book looks thinner than usual — visible liquidity is drying up
	•	Small trades (5–10 BTC) mostly on the buy side
	•	Price is hovering just under key resistance
	•	Buyer still dominates, but is showing signs of weakness

⸻

Grizzly’s View:

BTC still looks bullish overall — but the order book is getting empty. That usually means volatile moves are coming.

Watch out for possible squeezes in both directions today.

We’re still trying to push through the 88,600–88,800 sell zone — but it’s a grind. Liquidity above is thick, and buyers are starting to thin out.

Also worth noting: Bitcoin dominance is showing a bearish divergence.
If dominance starts to pull back, we might see a relief bounce on altcoins while BTC goes into minor consolidation or even a shakeout.

⸻

TL;DR:

	•	Buyer still leads, but is weakening
	•	Order book is thin = expect high volatility
	•	Resistance still strong at 88.2K–88.8k
	•	Bearish divergence in BTC dominance → alts could pop
	•	Stay sharp. Protect your capital.

⸻

Coffee’s hot. Book’s thin.
Grizzly is watching — and ready for the squeeze.

A friend of mine is trying to crowdfund for a wonderful community project in Chippenham, anyone that can chip(penham) in would be greatly appreciated!

https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/preserve-hardens-farm

""Hello, we are Emma and Miriam. We are both Mums to three year old boys and Emma has a baby daughter. Around a year ago we set out trying to find a parcel of land to establish an outdoor sensory based stay and play for Children under five years old. As new mums we have found Chippenham lacks permanent spaces where you can meet with other parents in a safe and stimulating environment for your child such as outdoor stay and plays and play hubs. 


When Hardens Farm came up for sale we saw an opportunity to expand our idea to include the whole community and preserve what is a beautiful space in the heart of Chippenham countryside for all the community to enjoy now and for future generations. The farm is passed everyday by walkers, runners and cyclists, it has grade two listed buildings and will hold memories for many of the residents of Chippenham.


Our main vision is to preserve and restore the buildings that are currently onsite and open it up for the community to access and enjoy. Along with our original idea of a play space for children under 5 we would also like to expand this to include space for older children and repurpose the main listed barn as a café. The other buildings could become creative art spaces, an onsite shop for local sellers, group meeting rooms with the open space to the back of the farm being an outdoor area for schools to visit, home education groups, sensory garden, local groups to meet or for people to just sit with a coffee and a book and enjoy the countryside. We would love to see animals return to the farm in the form of a sanctuary. 


The farm is currently on the market for offers over £750,000 with a lot of interest and a short window of time to raise the money. We know this is such an ambitious task but we feel passionately that Chippenham could really benefit from such a community space. We feel that if we did not try and save the farm that we would regret not trying so here we are! If we are unsuccessful in reaching our target all money will be refunded. Having met with the estate agent today (Tuesday) it appears we need to be in a position to make an offer on Friday. In terms of the population of Chippenham the amount needed represents around £18 a person, we realise that some are not in a position to give and some would maybe give more. If you would like to see this lovely old farm remain in some form rather than redeveloped into houses then please consider supporting out campaign.

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup akso no fake tan or  fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

## Alternatives to Nespresso ​Tea Pods

While **Nespresso tea pods** offer undeniable convenience, they're not the only option for⁤ enjoying tea with your Nespresso⁤ machine. Here‌ are a⁢ few alternatives to consider:

1.  **Reusable ⁣Capsules:** For the⁣ environmentally⁤ conscious, reusable capsules can be⁣ filled with your favorite loose-leaf tea.⁤ This option⁢ allows⁤ for greater control over the brewing process ⁣and reduces waste. The main con is the cleaning time and making sure the grinding‌ is perfect to have a good extract.

2. ‍ **DIY Tea Bags:** You can create your own ‍tea bags using empty tea⁢ bags and your preferred loose-leaf tea. This option offers some of the convenience of tea pods while giving you more flexibility in⁣ choosing ‌your tea.

3.**Traditional Tea ⁣Brewing Methods:**⁤ Embrace the ritual of traditional ‍tea⁢ brewing‌ with ⁢a⁤ teapot or infuser. This method‌ allows for a richer and more nuanced flavor experience. The ​downside is ​the‍ added‌ time and possible mess.

4.  **Specialized⁢ Tea Machines:** Several ⁤machines are designed specifically for brewing tea, offering precise temperature ‍control ⁣and brewing times for different types of tea. ⁢These‌ machines offer a superior flavor than any other solution.

1jk7nmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1jk7nmt/can_aigenerated_branding_outshine_human/,Can AI-Generated Branding Outshine Human Designers—or Is Creativity Still King?,"Imagine you’re flipping through your phone, and a slick ad for a new tech gadget pops up. The logo’s sharp, the colors pop, and it feels like it was made just for you. Then you hear it was designed by AI in seconds flat. Wild, huh? That’s the reality of [AI-generated branding](https://weandthecolor.com/is-ai-generated-branding-the-future-or-do-human-designers-still-steal-the-show/201138) today—it’s fast, it’s everywhere, and it’s turning heads. But here’s the big question buzzing around: Are human designers still the MVPs of branding, or is AI about to swipe their spotlight? Let’s chat about this shift, peek at some real examples, and figure out what makes a brand stick in your mind. Grab a snack—this is gonna be a fun ride!

The design world’s buzzing with AI tools that whip up logos, ads, and even full brand vibes quicker than you can brainstorm a tagline. Businesses love it—cheap, fast, and oh-so-easy. But does that mean the days of human creatives sketching ideas over late-night coffee are fading? Not quite. There’s a tug-of-war happening between tech and talent, and it’s got everyone talking. So, what’s your gut say? Can a machine really capture a brand’s soul, or is there something special about the human touch? Let’s break it down together.

What’s AI-Generated Branding All About?

First things first—what’s this AI-generated branding hype? It’s when smart algorithms create visual stuff like logos, packaging, or social media graphics based on a few words you toss their way. Type “hip vegan café logo, green and chill,” and boom—AI hands you options in minutes. Tools like Brandmark and Hatchful are making it happen, serving up designs that look pro without the hefty price tag.

Here’s the cool part: AI doesn’t just guess. It studies trends, crunches data, and pulls from a massive pool of inspiration. Ever wonder why some AI logos feel so on-point? It’s all that behind-the-scenes smarts. But can it really get what a brand’s about, deep down? That’s the million-dollar question we’re digging into today.

AI in Action: How It Stacks Up

Let’s check out some real-world vibes. Look at LogoMaker—it’s pumped out thousands of logos for startups. One case? A pet store got a cute, paw-shaped design in under five minutes—simple, effective, done. Now, think of Airbnb’s logo, crafted by human hands in 2014. That swoopy “A” isn’t just pretty—it’s a story of belonging, sketched with intention.

Or take Pepsi’s 2023 AI-generated campaign—glossy, futuristic visuals that lit up X. People shared it like crazy, but it still leaned on decades of human-built brand equity to hit home. So, what’s the deal? AI’s got speed and shine, but human designs often carry that extra punch. Which one grabs you more—a quick AI win or a human-crafted classic?

\---

Why Everyone’s Obsessed with AI-Generated Branding

So, why’s AI-generated branding blowing up? For starters, it’s wallet-friendly. A human designer might charge a small fortune, but AI tools? Peanuts. Next, it’s lightning-fast—perfect for that last-minute launch. And it’s flexible—tweak a prompt, get a dozen new looks. Small biz owners are eating it up, and big brands are testing it out too.

The tech’s getting sharper every day, pulling inspiration from what’s hot online. Imagine launching a side hustle and having a logo ready before your coffee’s cold—pretty sweet, right? But here’s something to mull over: Does fast and cheap beat the slow-cooked magic of a human’s vision? Or are we just dazzled by the shiny new toy?

Where Humans Still Rule the Roost

Now, let’s flip it—humans have tricks AI can’t touch. They get the messy, beautiful stuff—like a brand’s heart and quirks. Think of Spotify’s bold, duotone look. That wasn’t just a cool design; it was a human saying, “We’re loud, we’re different.” AI might spit out something similar, but would it feel that alive?

Humans also pivot like champs. They chat with clients, sense the vibe, and tweak on the spot. AI’s more rigid—give it bad inputs, get meh outputs. And that gut instinct? Priceless. Ever had a random idea that just worked? That’s human gold AI’s still mining for. So, while AI-generated branding nails efficiency, humans bring the feels.

What Makes a Brand Go Viral?

Here’s the juicy bit—what makes a brand unforgettable? Is it AI’s pixel-perfect polish or human-made charm? Check out Dollar Shave Club’s launch video—cheeky, scrappy, all human. It exploded online because it felt real. Could AI script that? Maybe, with tons of data. But the raw edge? That’s human DNA.

Great brands tell stories. Look at Lego—every design screams play and nostalgia, built by people who get it. AI can copy the look, but it’s not living the memory. So, when a brand hooks you—say, a logo that feels like home—is it the tech or the person behind it? What’s your bet?

The Future: Best of Both Worlds?

So, are human designers toast? Nah—think partnership, not takeover. Picture AI cranking out drafts and humans adding the soul. It’s already kicking off—studios like Wolff Olins use AI for quick ideas, then refine with human flair. Faster work, bigger wow factor.

For AI-generated branding to rule solo, it’s gotta crack emotion—tough nut to crack. Until then, humans steer the ship. Imagine a brand where AI nails the look, but a designer crafts its voice. Cool combo, right? What do you think—could AI and humans tag-team the next big thing?

The Final Word: Who’s Got the Edge?

So, what’s the verdict? AI-generated branding’s a beast—quick, cheap, and loaded with promise. It’s flipping the script for startups and giants alike. But human designers? They’re the soul-keepers, weaving emotion and instinct into every line. It’s not about one beating the other—it’s what you’re after: speed or depth, tech or heart.

Next time you see a logo that stops you cold, ask: AI or human? The rise of AI-generated branding is shaking things up, but humans aren’t bowing out. It’s a mashup—and honestly, that’s the best part. Where do you stand—team AI, team human, or rooting for the collab?

I have $400k in my vanguard portfolio primarily in broad-based cap weighted domestic and international indexes. I recently signed up for margin and was shocked that I have $138k available to trade on margin.

Current situation: I have nominal debt, A1 credit, living expenses are basically non existent, and I only pay $600 in rent. I work as a scientist and make over 100k a year. I would like to pursue my ph.D. I also have a medical malpractice lawsuit in progress for the wrongful death of my mom and could potentially see a significant settlement. Additionally, I have 1 bitcoin in a cold wallet. Lastly my employer has an employee stock purchasing plan @ 15% off.

My question is what would you think would be a smart move to slightly amplify returns? I consider myself a decent investor. I mainly embrace indexing, but take on some risk with derivatives like futures and covered calls. 

Im fascinated by the concept of borrowing money to buy assets. This loan amount is like a pharmacists salary in seconds over a cup of coffee with lower taxes. It’s exhilarating but I’m not a kid whose found his dads gun, I’m very cautious. Like Ben Graham said, “Safety of Principle and a moderate return.”

In my hemisphere, everyone around me seems to be saying borrow and buy assets. Fractional reserve banking is a joke, they print money out of thin air why work hard for it and pay taxes on it. Interest is cheaper. Should I tap into this well while the ball is rolling nice for me? Thanks for reading and I appreciate the guidance.

* I'm 40.
* My ex-best friend is 41. \*Samantha\*
* My mum is 60.
* My ex-best friends kids are currently 15 and 9.

**Story**

When me and my ex-best friend Samantha \[Sam\] were in our early 20s, she married and divorced within 3 years, and as a result, found herself homeless with two very young children.

At the time \[while we were ""best friends""\] I asked my mum if Sam could stay in my childhood home, in my old bedroom, with the kids, until she sorted out temporary accommodation. During this time, which was about 8 months, she and my mum became very close.

Fast forward to around 2019, I was in a no-contact situation with my mum - after she revealed my sexual assault to the entire family. Despite Sam knowing everything about why I had decided to go no contact, she continued to have a relationship with my mother behind my back as if she was my biological sister, caught up in a family dilemma. I obviously stopped having anything to do with her immediately just due to lack of trust and feelings of betrayal.

Despite my decision to end the friendship and no longer have anything to do with her , she still continued to go out of her way to maintain a relationship with my mum as if she was a member of my family, meeting up for dinners, lunches & coffees. During heated arguments with my mum, she would also report back on conversations they had both had about me and my 'behaviour"". I honestly wouldn't put it past them both to be honest so have no doubts about whether this is true. My mum also got into this habit of going to watch Sam's children's school performances, swimming tournaments, attended birthdays as if the kids were her grandchildren. 

Now in the present day 2025, they still continue to have the same disturbing relationship and there is never any cessation. I haven't spoken to her since 2019, but when I see my mum she's still brags about, coming back from seeing Sam and her kids, saying things like ""I know you don't like when I bring her up...but I'm just off to go and watch X in her dance competition"". She is so gleeful and excited about her adopted grandchildren lol. It always makes me laugh every time. 

Me and my ex-best friend are arch enemies \[things have obviously grown more intense over time because of what they've been doing\]. 

In 2021 when I moved home for a year during COVID, I would return home and find Sam's car parked outside and walk into my own home to find her and the kids there. My mum would never warn me or give me a heads up. This happened all the time while I was there. 

With the help of a therapist, I am planning on going no contact once I managed to tie up loose ends that relate to my inheritance and a property that my dad left to me and my mum after his passing, but once that is sorted she will never hear from me again. 

I suppose this is just a vent really, but sometimes I think I am being dramatic when I refer to my mum's behaviour as egregious. Sometimes narc-parents will make you think you're going mad because the toxic behaviours they demonstrate become routine and habitual. 

I guess I am just looking for clarification that I'm not being an arsehole and that my feelings of contempt towards them both are valid.

I have however noticed my BP creep up over the weeks and yesterday's reading was the most alarming one. I never took my reading often before meds, but when I did it was always within the 110s/70s. 

After 2 weeks I noticed it moving to the 120s/70s and yesterday I got 135/77. Did it a few more times, the highest being 138/85 and lowest being 121/80.  My pulse is always very good though, at 55bpm. 

This is really bizarre to me because I am quite healthy. Don't smoke, drink like 2 pints on average a month, do brisk walks everyday, play football fortnightly, am a healthy weight (6'3 82kg), the only issue rn is my sleep is a bit shorter than it should be, slightly below 7 hours on average, and my dad's BP is quite high despite him being healthy for his age so it could be genetic.

I also deal with anxiety and prior to doing my reading I felt nervous that I would break a record lol so that definitely would've contributed to it. Also did 3 readings this morning, the highest being 132/75, and the lowest being 117/80.

I am planning to stop drinking coffee completely (only drank 1 a day in the morning for the last few years) and will also speak to my GP, I've already told my ADHD provider. I know I'm not technically in the hypertension range yet, I just find even an elevated reading to be really unusual due to my age and health metrics. Anything else I can do to bring it down?

I wanted to liken it just now to the horses head scene but I think that’s a tad dramatic. I feel like my body was playing tricks on me, my period yesterday was there but BARELY and then overnight BAM HELLLLLO. Sprinted to the shower. And have to change my fitted sheet -_- that’s so uncommon, weird. I feel like day two is the worse so god help me today and tonight I guess. UGH. I hate when it’s like this. I *dread* the day I’m staying at Andy’s and it happens. DREAD. It happens so rarely, once or twice a year, and it’s nothing major just a little patch but it’s mortifying and I’m the only one that sees it right now? Imagine on HIS bedding… I’d rather die? Except I know he wouldn’t be angry with me, it’s not that I dread it’s him being secretly grossed out by me. It’s just so… ugh. I just feel disgusting this time of the month. I do not see how some women rejoice in it and feel goddess like. AND RHE FREE BLEEDERS? What the actual f. I don’t know much about it but I know I have zero interest. Ugh. I realise it’s just a natural process of being a fertile woman and that’s great and all but I am literally leaking blood, nothing about this is worth rejoicing…? Ick. Anyway I dread the day this could happen when I’m staying at his. On the plus side, yay morning shower. Now I can smell my delicious body wash all day. 

I got this app called finch and I don’t like it so I don’t wanna go past my free trial but I cannot stand the idea of leaving my little bird? I named him Ruffles and he’s a little grey plumpy baby bird and I put a little pink bolero type ribbon on him and he’s only a baby and I’m abandoning him? But the app is… meh? But RUFFFFFLES. They knew what they were doing when they made this stupid app. Suckering in the suckers like me. Ugh. 

I love a drink. I just made my breakfast and in front of me I have a smoothie, a coffee, my glow drink and a big glass of water. Yum. 

I feel tired. I slept fine but I feel tired. Exhausted. Drained. Not great. 

Goddddddddddd he is so hot. Everything about him I adore. How can he be so cute!!! He got a new new jersey and showed me it and he looks so good I can’t stop going back to look at it. He’s so delicious. My sweet baby. I am head over heels in love with him but equally I have such a major crush on him and keep smiling thinking about him and wnshanvssbk I just adore him so much. And his rings! Seeing them stacked on his finger makes me feel so nice? 

I have soft spot stuck in my head. It’s such a cute song. 

Imagine the shower before your wedding day. It would be so intense. I was just thinking about it now wondering what I would do in it. It would be like an everything shower on steroids. I’d need a Powerade to see me through. Imagine choosing your wedding day perfume! Or would you wear the one you always wear? I kind of like the idea of that more, if you have a signature scent anyway. If I knew Andy by a certain fragrance I would want that familiar comforting scent surrounding me, but also there’s something kind of special having a scent that you attach to that day. Hm. I wonder what he thinks? I probably shouldn’t ask, I’ve already been looking desperately deranged the last couple of days I don’t now need to bring up marriage prep thoughts to the poor guy. I hope if we do choose to get married we can elope. I really don’t want a wedding. Or an audience. I just want it to be us. I think he’d want his best friends and family there though. Maybe we could elope to be married, and then just have a big dinner with them all? I wonder if his mum would be comfy coming if his dad is there? I don’t like to push/ask about that sort of topic, it’s not really relevant to me atm and idk, I can’t entirely gauge him on that topic as sometimes he avoids it or sometimes he’ll mention tidbits. I feel like that’s an in person thing to learn. Anyway. All I know is I don’t care about marriage but if I do I want it super low key and as intimate as you can get. But I went a pretty dress. And a beautiful, romantic setting. Okay ANYWAY stop daydreaming. I just feel so loved up and he’s so f’ing delicious and it set me off. 

I had a Thai green cashew and tofu curry with some naan for dinner and it was delicious. 

I did the YT quiz with M too which was fun. I love quizzes.

And I just now had a shower and ‘meditated’ and I used my new hair mask too! 

And now it’s 9:43pm so I think I will go to sleep soon. 

I miss him. I love him so much. It’s like I think I couldn’t love him more, and then I do. Imagine in person… I think I might slip into a coma from an adoration overdose. Lord help me. Baby. My baby. Sweet baby honeybunny.

Un dì, indè 'na frazione de Brescian, gh'era 'na vecchietta che la se ciamaa Nonna Lidia. La l'era conosciuda in te töt el paes per 'l sò talent de fa calze. In quell'epoca, le calze le eran fatte a man, e la Nonna Lidia la se metteva semper a lavorà con i sò filati colorati.

Ogni matina, la s'alzava col sole, la preparava 'l caffè e la se metteva a lavorà. I sòn del fil de la lana che correa tra le man de Lidia, l'era come 'na melodia che fai cantà l'ani. La gente del paes la veniva da luntan per comprà le sò calze, perché le eran calde come 'l abbraccio de 'na mamma.

Un giorno, però, el paese l'era in festa. Se preparava 'na grande sagra e tutti gh'aveven bisògn de vestirse bene. Lì, i paesani la gh'an dit: “Lidia, fa' e calze più belle che pò, che doman l'é la sagra e tutti la volem nòter magnifici!”

La Nonna Lidia, entusiasta, la se messa a lavorà de più. La gh'aveva 'na idea in mente: l'usià de tanti colori, da fa' calze che parèven un arcobaleno! Ma, mentre la lavorava, la se accorse che la lana colorata l'era quasi finita. El panico l'è nasè a i so cores, ma la Nonna Lidia la l'era furba. 

L'è andada in giro per el paes e la gh'ha chiest a tutti se gh'aveven anca un pezzett de lana che pòdèsse usà. I paesani, sentendo la sò richièsta, la sponcàt i sò cassetti e l'han tirà fora i pezzi de lana vecia.

In poche ore, la Nonna Lidia la gh'ha ricevù 'na muntagna de colori. La l'ha lavorà tanto, che anche le stelle in ciel le gh'eren invidiose de tanta bellezza. E a la fin, l'é sortì 'na collezione de calze tanté belle che i fanòni sù d'antica, e c'era de töt: gialla, rossa, verde e anca blu!

La sera de la sagra, la gente la portava le calze de Nonna Lidia, e insieme a bun piatt de torta e vin, la festa la l'é diventata 'na cosa meravigliosa! Tüt el paes l'ha ballà e rìs, onorando la creatività de 'na vecchietta che aveva un gran cori.

E da quel dì, le calze de Nonna Lidia l'é diventà 'na leggenda, un simbolo de comunità e di lavoro insieme. E ogni ann, in quella sagra, tutti i paesani i mettava le calze colorate, per ricordà la magia de la Nonna.

Spero che t'è piaciuta! Se ti serve altro, son qui!Sure! Here’s the translation of the story into English:

---

Once upon a time, in a village near Brescia, there was an old lady named Grandma Lidia. She was well-known throughout the town for her talent in knitting socks. Back then, socks were handmade, and Grandma Lidia always got to work with her colorful yarns.

Every morning, she would wake up with the sun, brew her coffee, and start knitting. The sound of the yarn running through Lidia's hands was like a melody that made the heart sing. People from all over would come to buy her socks because they were as warm as a mother's embrace.

One day, however, the village was celebrating. They were preparing for a big festival, and everyone needed to dress well. The villagers said, ""Lidia, make the most beautiful socks you can, because tomorrow is the festival, and we all want to look splendid!""

Grandma Lidia, excited, got to work. She had an idea in mind: to use many colors to make socks that looked like a rainbow! But, while she was working, she realized that the colorful yarn was almost finished. Panic started to rise in her heart, but Grandma Lidia was clever.

She went around the village asking everyone if they had any pieces of yarn they could spare. The villagers, hearing her request, dug into their drawers and pulled out old bits of yarn.

In just a few hours, Grandma Lidia received a mountain of colors. She worked so hard that even the stars in the sky were envious of the beauty. And in the end, she created a collection of socks so beautiful they seemed like ancient treasures, with every color: yellow, red, green, and even blue!

On the evening of the festival, people wore Grandma Lidia's socks, and together with delicious cake and wine, the celebration became a wonderful event! The whole village danced and laughed, honoring the creativity of an old lady with a big heart.

From that day on, Grandma Lidia's socks became a legend, a symbol of community and working together. Every year, during that festival, all the villagers wore colorful socks to remember the magic of Grandma.

## why Invest in a Hotel Scent Diffuser System?

In today's competitive hospitality landscape, simply providing comfortable rooms and efficient service is no longer enough. Guests are seeking immersive experiences that appeal to all their senses. This is where a well-chosen hotel fragrance diffuser can make a significant difference. Consider the following benefits:

*   **Enhanced Guest Experience:** A carefully selected scent can create a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere, making guests feel more comfortable and at ease. This, in turn, can lead to higher satisfaction ratings and repeat bookings. Imagine walking into a hotel lobby and being greeted by a subtle, inviting aroma that instantly puts you in a good mood.this is the power of scent.
*   **Improved Brand Recognition:** Just like a logo or a color scheme, a signature scent can become strongly associated with your hotel brand.Over time, guests will begin to recognise and remember your hotel based on its unique aroma, contributing to a stronger brand identity. Scent branding for hotels is a powerful tool that is often overlooked.
*   **Increased revenue:** Studies have shown that pleasant scents can stimulate spending. By creating a positive and inviting atmosphere, you can encourage guests to spend more time in your hotel's restaurants, bars, and shops. A well-placed aroma diffuser for hotels can directly contribute to increased revenue streams.
*   **Positive First Impressions:** The lobby is the first point of contact for many guests. A well-scented lobby creates a positive first impression and sets the tone for the entire stay. A hotel lobby scent diffuser is therefore a crucial investment.
*   **Odor Control:** Hotel odor control systems are crucial. Scent diffusers can effectively neutralize unpleasant odors and create a consistently fresh surroundings throughout the hotel. This is particularly critically important in high-traffic areas like restrooms and hallways.

## Understanding Your Needs: Defining Your Ideal Hotel Scent Diffuser

Before diving into specific brands and models, it's crucial to understand your hotel's specific needs and objectives. Consider the following factors:

*   **Hotel Size and Layout:** How large is your hotel,and what is its layout? A small boutique hotel will have different scenting needs than a large resort. You will need to consider the square footage that each scent diffuser machine needs to cover.
*   **Target Audience:** Who are your guests? Are you catering to business travelers,families,or luxury travelers? The ideal scent profile will vary depending on your target audience.*   **Brand Identity:** What is your hotel's brand identity? Are you aiming for luxury, sophistication, relaxation, or energy? The scent should reflect your brand values.
*   **Budget:** How much are you willing to invest in a scent diffuser system? There are options available at various price points, so it's critically important to set a budget beforehand.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** How much time and effort are you willing to dedicate to maintaining the system? Some systems require more frequent maintenance than others.

## Types of Hotel Scent Diffuser Systems

There are several types of scent diffuser systems available for hotels, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

*   **Cold Air Diffusion Technology:** Cold air diffusion technology uses pressurized air to break down fragrance oils into a dry mist, which is then dispersed throughout the air. This method is highly effective at covering large areas and provides a consistent scent throw. It's also considered safe as it doesn't use heat, preserving the integrity of the fragrance oils.Many high-end hotels utilize cold air diffusion.
*   **HVAC Scent Diffuser System:** HVAC scent diffuser systems are integrated directly into the hotel's existing HVAC system. This allows for even scent distribution throughout the entire building. They are ideal for large hotels and resorts. Integration costs and potential disruptions during installation should be considered.
*   **Nano Diffusion Technology**: Similar to cold air diffusion, nano diffusion technology creates extremely fine particles of fragrance. Benefits include a more even scent distribution and a longer-lasting fragrance experience.
*   **Ultrasonic Diffusers**: Ultrasonic diffusers use water and ultrasonic vibrations to create a fine mist. They are relatively inexpensive and easy to use, but they are not as effective at covering large areas as cold air diffusion systems. They also require regular cleaning and refilling. These aren't usually recommended for large commercial spaces.
*   **Nebulizing Diffusers:** Nebulizing diffusers similar to cold air diffusion do not require water. Instead it uses pressurized air to atomize the fragrance oil directly into the air. With nebulizing scent diffusers, you can have more scent and less moisture in the air.
*   **Reed Diffusers:** Reed diffusers are a simple and inexpensive option for smaller areas. They consist of a glass bottle filled with fragrance oil and reeds that absorb the oil and release the scent into the air. They are not as effective at covering large areas and the scent throw is not as consistent.
*   **Scent Machines:** A Scent Diffuser machine is any automated system that diffuses scent. These can use a variety of technologies to disperse fragrance evenly and consistently.**Commercial Scent diffuser Considerations:** When selecting a system to use as a commercial scent diffuser,hotels must prioritize coverage,consistency,safety,and cost. Commercial grade scent diffusers are designed to handle large spaces.

Wooden decor ideas can transform any space, adding warmth and a natural aesthetic that resonates with many design styles. Whether you are looking to revamp your home or simply want to add a touch of rustic charm, incorporating wooden elements can make a significant impact.

One popular approach is to utilize reclaimed wood. Items crafted from reclaimed wood not only boast character but also promote sustainability. Consider using reclaimed wood for shelves, picture frames, or even a feature wall. These pieces often come with unique textures and colors that can serve as focal points in any room.

For those seeking a simpler touch, wooden accents can be incorporated through smaller decor items. Think about decorative bowls, candle holders, or coasters made of various types of wood. These accents serve both functional and aesthetic purposes, enhancing the overall look without overwhelming your decor scheme.

Another captivating idea is to create a wooden art piece or wall art. Artwork made from wood, such as geometric shapes or nature-inspired designs, can become a unique conversation starter. These pieces can be DIY-ed or purchased from artisans, allowing you to add an element that truly reflects your personal style.

Don’t forget about wooden furniture; it can be the centerpiece of your decor. Whether it's a handcrafted dining table, a rustic coffee table, or a vintage wooden bench, these pieces often tell a story and add depth to your design. Pair them with soft textiles to create contrast and visual interest.

Lastly, consider the power of wood in outdoor spaces. Outdoor wooden furniture, planters, and decorative elements like wooden fences or trellises can bring a harmonious blend of indoors and outdoors. By incorporating these wooden decor ideas, you can create an inviting atmosphere that highlights the beauty of natural materials.

1jk703a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/1jk703a/would_you_watch_this_continuation_of_the_show/,Would you watch this continuation of the show?,"Barely cooked Stargate continuation idea while making my morning coffee. Would you watch this?

Continuing the theme of some of the morally bankrupt things the SGC started to do in SGU (e.g. infiltrating Langara), we’re now in a world where (not guided by SG-1, Hammond/Landry at the helm), things have taken a bit of a nose-dive from the ‘do what’s right’ SGC we know and love.

A new enemy is encountered due to this increasingly arrogant attitude - classic Stargate fair. (Technically SGA could even be continued this way if you made the enemy the Wraith who have grown to never before seen heights due to the Tau’ri’s absence from Pegasus - personally I like the idea of a new enemy though)

However, the continuation of the series relies on some old favourites e.g. the original team(s) to get back out there and ultimately reach a diplomatic conclusion to the resulting conflict, the way the likes of Jackson and Weir and others would have wanted.

Personally I think it’d be a good way to engage with the original themes of the show, while including some things the show was progressing towards (and in my opinion reflective of what some of the modern world is like).

SGU would continue as it was, the same amount of time having passed as in real life, Eli having fixed the pod.

So I'm 29(F) and he is 30(M), we're both new to this company in BGC and ever since our training started, he is somewhat curious about me, asking me about my hobbies, weekends and stuff. I am currently in a relationship, and he is married, which he never talks about kung hindi mo tatanungin. So we became close, kasi nag click ung ugali namin which is ma kwela kasi ako ang open minded like we can talk about anything under the sun without judgement.

All of a sudden, sinigawan nya ko, ""Ginawa ko na nga! bakit ba paulit ulit ka?!"", Like WTF, nagulat ako..nag freeze ako and  i could not believe na sisigawan nya ko ng ganun.. I shut down, and i never talked to him again.

Then all of a sudden, may kinuha sya sa desk nya and lumapit sakin, he kissed my head and whispered ""I'm so sorry"". Nagulat ako, but di ko sya pinansin. Nag chat din sya sakin, nag sosorry ulit.
