1najmk9,https://i.redd.it/gi2ko8yv3onf1.jpeg,"Ristretto, 51mm","Chat, I have to drive 2 hours in the traffic to get the most heavenly cortado you could possibly imagine. I find myself driving this distance after i clock out 2 sometimes 3 times a week. I need help. I asked them why their cortado is so much superior to other ones near where i live and they just told me they use ristretto shots instead of espresso.

I have finally caved and bought:

- an at-home coffee machine (casabrews cm5418, 51mm)
- a single wall separate 51mm basket/portafilter instead of the double wall it came with.
- a single dose ""neretva"" 150w 30 setting burr coffee grinder 
- tamper, leveler, tickler, puck screen set (came around $30, i assume not the greatest but should do the job)
- a ""WACACO"" exagram pro coffee scale w timer

Damage is done, I have a subscription to their weekly freshly roasted beans that i grind for my morning pourovers.

Damage is done, I am using steamed whole milk (my milk steaming is also probably subpar and would love tips, i just watched tiktok tutoriald) and yet my cortado is just not as good. I have been researching dialing settings for ristrettos however everything i come across is for either 58mm or 54mm baskets. Can any blessed soul PLEASE help me with some guidance to pull a heavenly sweet double shot ristretto on a 51mm machine.

Is 14g dose too little? (most people recc 14g for a double espresso on 51mm) should i go for 15-16g instead? aim for 20s or more? is 1:1.5 good?

Like, the picture is Orcas Blend from Vashon Island Roasters. The blend is about 3:1 medium:dark roast with some janky beans. But, for my palette, it makes great French press and espresso. Taste reminiscent of a Lindt dark chocolate truffle.

I’ve been tricked by so many self-help scams—books, supplements, gadgets—all promising change but doing nothing. L-theanine doesn’t actually fix coffee jitters, ashwagandha and St. John’s wort don’t actually lift moods, therapy doesn’t actually have long term benefits (maybe for some), and skin products won’t stop aging. The Levoit stand fan doesn’t actually blow out super cold air like I thought it did. Amazon reviews lie unless a product has over 100k reviews, and most supplements are snake oil except maybe high-quality magnesium glycinate.

The truth is in front of us: no capsule will turn you into a genius, no affirmation will erase loneliness if you want love, and no product will give you happiness. Happiness comes from being with people who love you and who you love back and that’s supported by scientific evidence. Don’t trust nothing that’s not backed by science because now I got too many self help books, too many skin care products, and a stand fan that got 64k good reviews but doesn’t blow out super cold air. 

Life is really that simple. You need a man if you want one or else you will feel terrible. You can’t stop the wrinkles from coming even with that red light masks. Fans can’t blow out AC type air because that’s just not how it works. You knew all this from the get go. You don’t need to look within. The truth about everything is right in front of your face.

I am currently doing the 50-30-20 budgeting method. Okay naman, effective siya dahil alam ko na how much I can spend para sa needs and wants. Pero lately, I want to be more conscious on how much I spend. Minsan kasi nagagalaw ko yung for needs sa mga wants ko, and vice versa. Hindi ko na masyado nasusunod yung system kaya ang ending ay 80% ng monthly income ko ay for spending. Naisip ko, better ba na mag set ako ng allowance for spending na parang high schooler?

I don’t have a fixed amount for how much i spend in a week. Wala din akong transpo fee dahil malapit lang house namin sa workplace ko. Hindi din ako lagi naglulunch sa office, so I really don’t spend much kapag weekdays. 

Mas okay ba if ibawas ko na sa needs yung magiging “allowance” ko. Say, 1k a week ganon. Dito na manggagaling yung mga weekdays spending (iced coffee) ko. Then yung 30% wants ay for actual wants ko talaga na hindi lang basta cravings.

1najeeg,https://i.redd.it/h8syk6vq1onf1.jpeg,Philos vs Acaia Orbit vs 078s help me decide [$1500],"Hey all, would love some advice on grinder upgrade!

I’m having a lot of issues with my VS3 - keeps jamming up early in the morning when I’m especially cranky without coffee.

Considering an upgrade to either :

•	⁠acaia orbit space grey open box w Ssp multi-purpose for $1365
•	⁠acaia orbit black new w ssp lab sweet for $1700
•	⁠mazzer philos silver i200d for $1365
•	⁠timemore 078s for $650

Main question is - is the Timemore really a league apart from the Acaia and Mazzer? Is the $1000 price difference worth it?

I don’t love the plastic hopper on the Timemore, gives me doubts re: build quality… and worried about eventual upgrade-itis.

Is the Acaia overpriced and a bit gimmicky what with the app and GBW (is there even a point to that when there is no hopper??)?

1najeb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1najeb3/f_farm_boy/,[F] Farm Boy,"Decius awoke when the sky was still dark. Through his bedroom window he could see four bright stars, the other suns of the Pentacle Systems.

Why, he wondered, had he awoken? He missed his dreams. Lately, they had been getting far stranger and more interesting. Through his window, open to the cool night air, came the faint sound of footsteps. That was wrong, wrong, no one should be up and about on the Ignatz farm so early in the season. He donned his boots and buckled on his autopistol.

He didn’t wake Papa Ignatz. He would take care of things himself. He needed a good scrape,, and it was so seldom he could get away with kicking someone’s ass. He climbed down the stairs as quietly as he could, so as not to wake his father snoring alone in the big bed with its Aquilla quilt.

He opened the back door and, keeping tight to the wall, went around the brick farmhouse. Right there, by the goat barn, he saw a black figure next to the three-wheelers. He drew his autopistol and got a good sight picture as his dad had taught him, and then shook his head and holstered the weapon. Shooting the bastard wasn’t what he wanted, what he needed. He holstered the gun and went for the gate as one of the three-wheelers roared to life.

The three-wheelers could drive fine off-road, were designed for it, but the gate was the only way off the Ignatz lands without cutting the fence. You needed the right kind of insulated tool to do that; the weed-cutter fence had some hefty voltage on it. The thief drove in tight circles in the west pasture for about twenty minutes, ruining good goat fodder and trying Decius’ patience. Decius considered going after him, but when Decius was about to move, the thief gunned the engine and accelerated toward the gate.

Decius waited as long as he dared. Then, leading the three-wheeler as well as he could, he placed a shot in its bulbous front tire. The vehicle lurched to the left and went down on its side with a satisfying crash.

Decius ran toward the vehicle. He was pleased to see the thief crawling out from under the vehicle.

“You're gonna fight me here, good and proper,” Decius commanded.

“You try to run, I blast your ass.”

Decius and the thief circled, trying to flank each other. The thief tried a straight right at Decius’ head. Decius blocked it, bruising his forearm. The thief couldn’t get his hands up in time. Decius connected with a left jab and right upper cut. The thief crumpled. Decius wasn’t sated. He stood over the thief, hesitating. His father would never hit a man when he was down, but Decius wondered how it would be to beat a man to death.

From behind, he heard the horn of the other three-wheeler. He turned to see Papa Ignatz dismounting. His dad walked over to the thief and shined a flashlight in his face.

“That’s Johnny Alvarez. You clean up and go back to bed. I’m taking his addicted ass home. We can fix the three-wheeler tomorrow. And, no, you don’t to beat him more, you don’t need to get in trouble again.”

Walking back to the farmhouse, Decius yawned. Sleep would take him again despite the excitement of the fight.

Decius dreamed, a big man with ink black skin and red runes up and down his limbs was standing over his bed.

“You don’t need to listen to your dad like a toddler,” the man taunted.

There was a blast of green lightning, and another stood in the room. He was green, with a toothy face and impossible muscles like a Space Marine in a video.

“That git ain’t yours. You gonna wreck ‘im. Make ‘im so ‘e canna kill with ‘is ‘ead, just bang bang.”

The black man sprang at the green monster. A crazy knife with thorns that moved like centipede legs appeared in his hand.

“Your skull is mine, greenskin,” he yelled through an impossibly wide fang-lined mouth. Inside the mouth glowed twisting red flames.

“Get back ta da warp, you don’t get even a squig,” the green monster said with a mocking tone. It grabbed the black man and crumpled him until he turned into a ball of black and red paper. The green monster tossed the ball once in it’s hand, then threw it toward the horizon.

The monster turned toward Decius.

“Ya gotta get to Aachen. If I don’t get you, 'itsis boss will or the Big E will eat you.”

Over coffee and his dad’s spicy sausages, Decius told Papa Ignatz his dream.

“Son, you’re a killer. We both know this, even though you have no victims yet, at least that I know about. I don’t like it, but I can’t change it. I’m deeply sorry, but I think you’re a witch as well.”

“Aren’t they usually little girls?”

“In videos, they are, but real ones don’t have to be cute doomed children. They can be nearly grown boys with chips on their shoulders. The black ships are here on Crione. If they want to take you, I can do nothing to stop it.”

Despite what Papa Ignatz feared, he and Decius still needed to get the goats out to the proper pasture. They and Captain Eggs, their border collie, walked over to the barn, only for a spark of blue fire to appear in the sky. Decius watched as the blue fire descended, and it became apparent that what he was seeing was a spaceship using its engines to slow its descent from orbit. The sight awed him.

Three people got out of the ship. One was a long-limbed woman with what looked like a closed eye on her forehead. Another was a stocky man nearly as muscular as the green monster in Decius’ dream. The third was a normal-looking man although, like the other two, he wore exotic off-world clothes.

“Are you from the black ships?” Decius asked.

“No, I am Jacob Velman, Rogue Trader, and I am here to offer you an alternative way to serve the Emperor.”

“Why would you do that? Why should I trust you?”

“Have you been having unusual dreams? Have you dreamed of ecstatic violence, or filth that is both repulsive and inviting? Have you dreamed of impossible pleasures just beyond your grasp?” the woman asked.

“Some such dreams are normal for young men,” Decius said.

“Yes, but not yours. How do I know? You know what a navigator is? You know what I can do? The ruinous powers are reaching for you, boy, I sense it,” the woman said in a weary voice.

“If you don’t go with me, the black ships will take you. If the Emperor doesn’t devour your soul to fuel the Astronomicon, you will be taken and changed until you have no thoughts in your head but service to the Emperor.”

Decius spoke to the woman, “I believe you’re a psycher, but I don’t see how you could protect me from the Ruinous Powers. They have been around since long before any man left Holy Terra for the stars and you are a mortal woman, despite the extra powers you wield.”

Jacob answered, “She won’t protect you alone. There is a device you can wear on your head called a psycher hood. Mine, unfortunately, is designed for an Astartes, so it's heavy for a mortal man, but it functions.”

“Let me see this thing,” Decius said. He half expected it to be ridiculous looking, something they would want to photograph him in for a joke. He was curious, though. These people really were from off the planet, and if they were playing an elaborate prank, at least his neighbors would never see it.

The psycher hood proved to be a simple construction, though made of a metal he had never seen, despite working with many types of equipment on the farm. They placed it over his shoulders and turned it on. At once, a feeling of relaxation settled over him. At first, he thought he had been sedated, but then he realized the truth was different and more frightening.

“They’ve been trying to get in, and I’ve been fighting them. Not just a little while, but for months and maybe years. This thing is heavy, it hurts my shoulders, but it’s the first time I’ve been able to rest in a long time. Mr. Velman, I’m going with you. If I stay, I’m a danger to my dad and not because I want to be.”

“Unfortunately, you are talking sense. There’s a squad of Salamanders on Paraachen. Go with them, and maybe you could make Librarian even though you’re older than is typical for an initiate.”

Decius climbed the ramp into the spaceship and lay on the couch that Jacob directed him to. The acceleration forces pushed him down into it as the spaceship lifted from the ground. On the monitor, he watched his world shrink into a dot.

From the pilot's console, Jacob spoke to Decius, “I’m sorry, I forgot to introduce Orrin. He’s a member of the human subspecies outsiders call squats. He’s my engineer.” The stocky man shook Decius’ hand. Decius had never felt such strength.

“Hey, Jake you forgot me,” the woman said. “I’m Veronica Falon of the *nobilitie navis.* I figured I'd better introduce myself before I get wired up and can’t talk to you anymore.”

Veronica retreated into a tiny alcove and closed the door.

The Orrin leaned over his own console.

“Activating Geller field in five,” he told the crew. Decius felt the null field, increasing his insulation from what he now understood were the whispers of the Ruinous Powers.

“Jumping to warp,” Jacob called and touched a button on his console. The world changed. The insulation provided by the Geller field and the psycher helm now seemed a frail thing, like a soap bubble. Outside the ship, Decius felt limitless energy. He wanted to touch it and shape it, but instinct told him that would be dumber than touching his father’s weed-cutter fence.

Decius found out that a passenger on a ship in transit had little to do. Decius read, hardly his favorite hobby, and sparred with Orrin. He was outmatched by the older man, who was obviously going light on him, but learned a hip throw he hadn’t known before.

They fell out of warp in the Paraachen system. Despite wearing the psycher hood, Decius felt something. It was unquestionably dangerous, but unlike Chaos, it wasn’t reaching for him; he wanted desperately to reach for it. He began to pace the confines of the ship.

Veronica came out from the kiosk she’d been ensconced in while the ship had been in the warp.

“You're feeling waaagh energy,” she told Decius.

“What’s that?”

“It’s the collective self-delusion of the Orks. It warps reality and can kill,” Orrin said.

“I didn’t think they could do things like that. I thought only the pretty xenos could.”

“No, the Orks are psychic too. It’s just that they generate psychic energy themselves rather than harvesting it from the warp. It’s a lot more than self-delusion. Orrin just expects the materium to act a certain way, and sometimes it doesn’t,” Veronica told him.

The pilot’s console beeped. Jacob thumbed a button to play the incoming data squirt over the PA.

“This is Sergeant Long of the Salamanders. With both Orks and Tyranids, the situation on Paraachen is no longer tenable. We are evacuating civilians. Attempt a landing at your own risk. With the Emperor’s blessing, we will come back to Paraachen with sufficient personnel and material to retake the world, but at this time, attempting to hold it would just result in an unacceptable level of civilian losses.”

“I hate this,” Decius said.

“I have to get down there. I need to fight. I’m a witch, I’m a danger to myself and others. What better way to spend my life than attacking the enemies of mankind?” Decius said. His conscience was split. He knew he was somehow lying to people who had gone out of the way to help him, but he also needed to fight so badly that he felt he would sicken and die if he was prevented from joining the battle.

“What would your father say?” Orrin asked.

“He’d say I’d met an honorable end rather than dying in some stupid fight with Johnny Alvarez,” Decius said. He was finding it oddly difficult to speak properly, though this time his words felt more true.

“Take us down,” Veronica said, “there’s something upon him that feels like the secret shame of the Blood Angels. We cannot quench it ourselves.”

They landed the ship among fire and explosions. Jacob handed Decius a lasgun and a bolter.

“Emperor be with you, may you make your father proud,” he told Decius, embraced him, and quickly went up the ramp into the ship.

Decius looked about. A huge man in power armor was carrying a woman and a child. In her arms, the woman held a baby. A bug monster leaped forward and speared the woman with a vicious knife of bone that grew where a human would have a hand. While this happened, another monster jumped on top of the armored man and pulled off his head with one swift wrench. Decius shot both monsters and then shot again. An exultation he had never known filled him.

Two armored personnel carriers, painted red and looking like they were made of scrap, careened around the corner of a building. The green monster from his dreams got out, followed by smaller green monsters carrying guns that looked too big for them, and a couple of other monsters with no arms. These last jumped upon the bug monsters, bit, and chewed.

Decius shot bug monsters until his bolter was empty, and there was no more charge in his lasgun. After that, it was quiet, which was wrong. Why did the battle have to end?

The big monster ran up to Decius, smiled a toothy smile, and broke his nose with a huge green fist.

Decius fell back, then anger swelled in him. He pointed at the monster, and a bolt of white lightning sprouted from his fist and slammed into his attacker. The monster, now burnt, got up with a frown on its face. Decius felt a realization; he didn’t need to pull energy from that place. That place wanted to eat him; it would bring only trouble. He pulled again, this time from the place that felt right. The lightning was green now. The big monster diverted it so it hit one of the smaller ones, which exploded. There was a huge smile on its face.

“Knew you’d get it right, Weird Boy. You join Adszak and serve Glinzak warband or you die.”

Decius realized that he was losing words from his head, and it wasn’t Adszak’s fault. He was part of something bigger than himself now, and in that thing, speech wasn’t really a necessity. He felt his power reaching inside him, changing his muscles, bones, and teeth to more like they always should have been.

“Waaagh,” he yelled. He didn’t need to say anything else.",0,1757217470.0,40kLore,0,0.5,False
1najdre,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1najdre/my_inspiring_neighbor/,My inspiring neighbor…,"In 2012 I moved to the USA to pursue my dream of working in film, but as the years went by my parents back in Australia lost their business, had to claim bankruptcy, ended up in government housing and then finally passed away before I could “make it” and financially help their life be better in any real way.

It has been tough to reconcile feeling like I wasn’t there for them in that way after they’d been there for me growing up.

By complete happenstance after the lockdowns I ended up becoming friends with my 80+ year old neighbor down the street, Jeannine (actual age unknown!).

An unlikely and somehow familial friendship formed that has been surrounded with many coffees, conversations and long winding drives through the San Gabriel Mountains.

Anyhow, someone mentioned to me that the videos that I’ve been making of our hangouts, conversations and long-drives in her dinged-up old BMW were inspiring that I should share them.

So, I thought I’d mention it here in the hopes that it can serve to inspire others to show their aging people and say, “See? She’s not slowing down! All it takes is the right mindset! You got this!”

My hope is to inspire more aging people (and the younger ones who know it’s also going to happen to them!) to “choose youth” rather than simply giving up early just because of any expectations of how aging should occur.

And, creating these videos weekly has given Jeannine something to share with friends and family, which in turn has reignited her zest for life and given her many new reasons to bounce out of bed each day, week, month... and hopefully, for years to come.

Anyhow, in keeping with the rules, I can only talk about it as links are not allowed to be shared here, but I’d love to hear your thoughts, comments, reactions, ideas - everything - as heavy topics need a little levity every now and then. 💚✨

If your interest has been piqued, comment below to say so and I can send you a link to see the videos but that’s not my main goal here. I’m having fun watching Jeannine feel younger through this process and sharing that to hopefully inspire others is the goal. 

Also, if you’ve made it this far through my post, thank-you. I’m sending you much love. Supporting the aging is a serious gig and I see you, honor you and am truly grateful that a support network like this exists. What an incredible resource. 💪🏼",1,1757217412.0,AgingParents,1,1.0,False
1najc34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecuritythreatai/comments/1najc34/soc_analysts_are_burning_out_ai_might_be_the_only/,SOC analysts are burning out. AI might be the only thing keeping security teams alive in 2025,"Let’s be honest: working in a Security Operations Center (SOC) in 2025 feels like drowning.

The average analyst’s day starts with a flood of alerts—thousands of them. Most are false positives, some are duplicates, and buried in there might be one or two that actually matter. But when you’re already on your 10th cup of coffee and your tools don’t talk to each other, how do you spot the needle in the haystack?

That’s the brutal reality for SOCs today. According to Gurucul’s new [**2025 Pulse of AI Powered SOC Transformation Report**](https://gurucul.com/blog/2025-pulse-of-ai-powered-soc-transformation-report-out-now/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), alert volumes are exploding. Nearly 80% of organizations say their analysts are overwhelmed, with many reporting year-over-year increases of 25% or more. That’s not just “busy”—that’s *unsustainable*.

And it’s not just the noise. Attackers have gotten smarter. Identity is now the new attack surface, with phishing, stolen credentials, and social engineering driving most breaches. Yet, most organizations admit they don’t even have full visibility into identity and cloud activity. Think about that for a second: we’re fighting blind in the very areas attackers are most active.

Meanwhile, the tools that were supposed to help—like SIEMs—are failing. The report shows that 78% of organizations are dissatisfied with their SIEM. That’s staggering. These platforms were supposed to be the backbone of modern SOCs, but they weren’t built for today’s identity-first, cloud-heavy, constantly evolving threat landscape. Onboarding a new data feed can still take weeks or even months. In a world where threats move in hours, that lag is unacceptable.

So where does AI fit into all this? This is where it gets interesting. Almost 9 out of 10 organizations are piloting or deploying AI in their SOCs. The early results are actually impressive. Investigation times are being cut by 25–50%. Repetitive tasks like alert triage, enrichment, and false positive suppression are getting automated. Analysts aren’t being replaced—they’re finally getting breathing room.

But here’s the paradox: only 9% of organizations say they *fully trust* AI-generated alerts. That’s the tension we’re in right now. SOCs desperately need automation to survive, but security pros are hesitant to hand over decisions to a black box. And honestly, who can blame them? In this industry, one missed alert can mean a breach that costs millions. Trust isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s life or death for a security team.

This is why explainable AI is becoming such a big deal. If AI is going to play a central role in SOCs, analysts need to know *why* an alert was flagged, not just that it was. Transparency and context are what turn AI from a gimmick into a real partner.

The bigger question is whether SOCs as we know them can even survive without AI. Between analyst burnout, tool sprawl, and constantly evolving threats, the old model of throwing more humans at the problem simply doesn’t work anymore. AI might not be a silver bullet, but it could be the only realistic way to scale defenses fast enough to keep up with attackers.

So what do you think?

* Will AI really *save* SOCs, or are we just adding more noise with shinier tools?
* For those of you working in SOCs right now, would AI automation actually make your life easier, or would you spend just as much time double-checking it?
* And long-term—are we heading toward a future where the “SOC” as we know it disappears and gets rebuilt entirely around AI?

ON TOP OF THAT, my cars fuel hose snapped a few days ago and now my car is out of commission for awhile. 

i live paycheck to paycheck. so i can’t afford to get it fix right away. and i just recently got health insurance but it doesn’t kick in until the new fiscal year. ALSO for some additional understanding, i have very unmedicated ADHD. i struggle with being to things on time due to time blindness. and this is an issue im aware of and try my best to work around and not make other people’s problem. i also don’t call out all that much. and im a pretty solid employee. 

(CONTEXT OVER)

My boss lives 5 minutes walking distance from our store and walks to work. he is also a GM and has salary. today when i came to work he asked me in a sort of joking tone “did you get your car fixed” i quipped “well my fuel hose snapped…so no—“ and he sorta cut me off with “oh well those are easy to fix you just pull it out right?” (he knows nothing about cars. he doesn’t HAVE one) 

much later that day. i noticed tomorrow i have a shift for 8:30am. my ride to work may not be able to get me so i would i have to get a lyft to work. and thats $20ish there and then $20 ish back home after my shift ends. that’s $40 JUST to work one day. 

so i texted my boss during our operating hours this (this is exactly the text with some details redacted also for additional information my roommate also works at our store).

“tomorrow i’m scheduled for 8;30am. but i don’t have a ride. lyft is $20+ there and $20+ back. and i can’t afford to loss $40 just to work a day. is it possible to come in with my roommate at 9:15am instead of my 8:30 slot!”

that was only a 45 minute difference during a morning shift which means we are over staffed if anything.

alas. there was no response to my text. so i called his number about 20 minutes later. no answer. 

and then i called him on the store phone. he answer—!

GM - “hello.”

ME - “hey boss, did you get my text”

GM - “(heavy sigh) yes. i did. i CHOSE not to respond” 

ME - “—oh?”

GM - “ i am done with this. it’s not my job. i have been very patient with you about being late to work. you need to figure out your health and car problems because i’m no longer dealing with it. i’m putting my foot down. 

and tbh. i hung up one him. 

it was beyond unprofessional of him to say any of that to me. i would have very easily accepted a “no, i don’t think that will work, also i would like to discuss your being late tomorrow at work” 

but instead he attacked me for (checks notes) having problems outside of work? 

i’ve never made anything is problem in the past outside of maybe making him do his job when i’ve needed to call out for being sick. 

also this last part is hearsay because i was not with him or had any knowledge of his night. but it’s a well know fact to our co-workers that he drinks to go to sleep. and almost night drinks what he has claimed to be “2-3 bottles of wine” to pass out. 

so i suspect he may have been drunk. that’s the only reason i think he would have acted that way. 

i was livid and i shouldn’t have just hung up on him. that was indeed rude. but still am i crazy for thinking that was deeply unprofessional of him?

i want to report the incident to HR.

We have a great relationship, love each other very much, etc. Last year we were going through a very rough patch, my partner was dealing with a gambling problem and I had expressed my concerns to him multiple times. I explained to him that I felt disconnected, that I wasn’t getting enough affection from him, not getting enough quality time because of how much he was out gambling, I was worried about the money, and he basically told me I needed to get more hobbies and be more independent. This was the closest we had ever been to breaking up and I was in a terrible mental state. I struggle with Anxiety, OCD, and ADHD which is a hell of a combination while I was going through this rough patch. 
I started considering the worst case scenario which would be if my partner and I broke up. Then I was terrified about being lonely and having no one to talk to, as I didn’t have many close friends at this time either. I was thinking about different ways I could talk to people and I thought of dating apps. I thought of tinder and I was thinking well I don’t want to go on there because it’s known for hookups. So I wanted to see what other options there were for just talking to people to maybe spark up a genuine conversation and I went on the App Store and started browsing, I came across an app called coffee meets bagel and thought it sounded wholesome and i downloaded the app because the title was intriguing and I was curious. Once I opened the app it prompted me to start building a profile and then I was like wtf am I doing and I deleted the app. So I never made a profile, never saw anyone else’s profiles, etc. I never had the intention to start talking to another guy romantically, I was more so almost in “preparation anxiety mode” thinking about what I would do it my partner and I broke up. 

Since this all happened, my partner and I have both done a lot of work on ourselves. He has gotten his gambling under control completely, and I have become a lot less co-dependent. I would say our relationship is at the best point it has ever been at. However now I’m having terrible guilt thinking about how during that rough patch I considered going on a dating app. That was the closest I ever came to cheating. Loyalty and honesty are our highest values in our relationship and I feel like I’ve broken that. I’ve been beating myself up every day over this because I never thought I would ever cheat or consider cheating no matter what. If I tell my partner I feel like he would be hurt and confused because he probably thinks that’s something I would never do. But then if I don’t tell him I feel like I’m hiding a bad part of who I am. What should I do? 

TL; DR- I considered using a dating app when my partner and I were in a rough patch and now I am feeling incredibly guilty that I even ever considered that. Should I talk to my partner about this?

I think I'm missing something.,"So I've been trying to measure my calories, as I want to lose around 10kg. I've planned out a normal Wednesday, with breakfast, drinks, and dinner. But it's come out at under 1k calories. And other days of the week aren't much different. But I'm not losing weight.

Here are the calories for what I eat on a Wednesday.

Breakfast is 2 slices of bread, 1 with peanut butter, 1 with chocolate spread. Each slice of bread is 109 calories, 15g of peanut butter is 95, 15g of chocolate spread is 83. So breakfast is 396 calories.

Drinks is mostly water, coffee, or sugar free soda. Coffee I have about 2 level teaspoons of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of full fat milk, in total a coffee is around 50 calories, so 100 as I have at most 2 coffees a day.

Then dinner is chicken and broccoli. About 51 calories for broccoli, and around 375 for the chicken, 1 wing and 1 leg, roasted with skin on. Plus some hot sauce, which only adds about 4 calories (I get hot sauce no sugar).

That comes out at 878 calories. Which can't be right. If I was in that high of a calories deficit I be losing an unhealthy amount of weight.

Even adding on the odd piece of chocolate I have, it only adds maybe 300 calories.

I must've done the maths wrong somewhere. Either that or my physical conditions (chronic fatigue syndrome and ehlers-danlos syndrome) makes my daily calories needed much lower. But I can't see that being the case.

All of the food I eat us good quality. The peanut butter is just 100% peanuts. The chocolate spread is lower sugar than something like Nutella. The bread is wholewheat seeded. Etc.

But I can't see good quality ingredients knocking off over 1000 calories.

If someone could explain where I've gone wrong, and how counting calories works, I'd really appreciate it. As I'm clearing screwing something up here.",2,1757216759.0,loseit,8,1.0,False

Chapter Three – The Weight of Witnesses

Elena didn’t sleep that night. Every shadow in her apartment looked like it was leaning closer. Every sound felt amplified, the hum of the refrigerator, the whine of pipes in the wall, even the scratch of her own nails against her bedsheet.

She convinced herself the text had to be a prank. Maybe one of her friends saw the journal in her bag and decided to mess with her. But when she checked her call log, her messages, her socials, nothing connected. The number wasn’t saved, and no reverse search pulled up anything useful.

By morning, she was exhausted, but she couldn’t stop thinking about the names in the margins.

She decided to start with the one closest to her: Marisol T.

Marisol lived across town in a tidy, sun-faded duplex. Elena hadn’t seen her in months, but when she showed up unannounced that afternoon, Marisol’s smile faltered the moment she saw her.

“Elena? Everything okay?”

It was the way Marisol’s eyes flicked to the tote bag slung over Elena’s shoulder that made her skin crawl.

They sat at the kitchen table, sipping coffee. Elena tried small talk, but her throat burned with the urge to ask. Finally, she reached into her bag, pulled out the journal, and slid it halfway across the table.

“Do you know this?” she asked quietly.

Marisol’s hand twitched. For a moment, Elena swore she saw her cousin’s face drain of color. Then, with a shaky laugh, Marisol pushed it back.

“No. Why would I? It’s just an old notebook, right?”

But her voice betrayed her. Her fingers tapped nervously against the mug.

And that’s when Elena noticed something. On Marisol’s wrist, barely visible under the sleeve of her sweater, was a faded scar. A long, thin line, the same shape described in the entry where Isabel mentioned the “woman with the broken bracelet, who tried once to cut herself free.”

Elena’s breath caught.

Marisol leaned in, her voice low, urgent.

“You shouldn’t have it. You don’t understand what that book really is. It doesn’t belong to you.”

Elena whispered, “Then who does it belong to?”

Marisol’s eyes filled with something Elena had never seen before, not fear, not anger, but guilt.

Before she could answer, a car horn blared outside. Marisol jumped, snatched Elena’s wrist, and hissed, “Don’t bring that journal here again. Don’t even bring it to me. Some of us survived by staying quiet. You… you won’t.”

Elena left shaken, the words echoing in her chest.

That night, back in her apartment, she opened the journal again, desperate for clarity. And there it was, written across the top of the next entry, in thick black ink:

“The witnesses are not innocent. The silence is the crime.”

But the part that made Elena’s stomach drop wasn’t the line itself. It was what was scribbled beneath it,
her own name.

Ding!
He'd forgotten it at home.
Harrison unlocked the screen to see a message from the student.
[I scraped my knee carrying your cake. It really hurts.]
Attached was a suggestive photo - not of the sender's face, but of her thighs. The girl wore thigh-high white stockings with black Mary Janes and a plaid skirt hiked up to reveal toned legs. A fresh bruise bloomed on her porcelain skin. The youthful image paired with the coy message screamed calculated seduction.
Powerful men like Nathaniel always fell for this type.
Harrison's grip tightened until her knuckles turned white.
Ding!
Another message arrived.
""Mr. Falcon, see you at Silver Pines tonight! Let me make your birthday unforgettable.""
So his mistress planned to celebrate with him.
Harrison grabbed her purse and drove straight to Silver Pines Hotel. She needed to see this girl's face.
As she approached the entrance, she froze. Her parents Theodore and Victoria stood near the valet. Heart pounding, she approached them.
""Father? Mother? What are you doing here?""
The couple exchanged nervous glances before Theodore cleared his throat.
""Harrison... Isabella returned today. We're welcoming her back.""

Isabella?
Through the hotel's glass facade, Harrison spotted her sister - wearing the exact same plaid skirt from Nathaniel's phone. The mistress was her own flesh and blood.
Isabella had always been stunning, dubbed Willowbrook's ""Crimson Rose,"" famous for her dancer's legs. Countless men had fallen for her charms. Now her perfect sister was using those very assets to steal her husband.
Harrison let out a bitter laugh. ""I suppose I'm the last to know?""
Theodore gave an uncomfortable smile. ""Harrison, Mr. Falcon never wanted you.""
""Exactly,"" Victoria added. ""Every woman in Willowbrook wants Nathaniel Falcon. Better our Isabella than some stranger.""
Harrison's nails dug into her palms. ""I'm your daughter too!""
She turned sharply, heels clicking against pavement.
Victoria called after her. ""Harrison! Tell me - has Nathaniel ever touched you?"" Harrison stopped dead.
Theodore's voice turned cold. ""Don't act the victim. Three years ago when Nathaniel and Isabella were Willowbrook's golden couple, everyone expected their engagement. Then the accident left him comatose. You were just the placeholder.""
Victoria's gaze swept over Harrison's simple dress. ""Look at you - a frumpy housewife while Isabella became principal dancer at the National Ballet. She's the swan, you're the duckling. What could you possibly offer him? Just give him back.""
Each word stabbed deeper. Blinking back tears, Harrison fled.
Night had fallen when she returned to Rosewood Manor. She'd dismissed the staff, leaving the mansion dark and hollow.
She sat alone at the dining table.
The food had gone cold. The cake she'd decorated read ""Happy Birthday My Love"" in perfect script.
The irony burned - her entire existence was a joke.
Nathaniel and Isabella had been Willowbrook's darlings, with Isabella as his treasured ""Crimson Rose."" Then the accident left Nathaniel vegetative and Isabella vanished abroad.
That's when the Whitmores dragged Harrison from the countryside to take Isabella's place. She'd agreed eagerly - she'd loved Nathaniel since childhood.
For three years, she'd devoted herself to his care, abandoning her own life to nurse him. Her efforts paid off - Nathaniel woke.
Harrison lit the birthday candles.
Their glow reflected in the mirror - a plain woman in a shapeless dress, no sparkle left.
Meanwhile, Isabella remained radiant - a prima ballerina in her prime.
Harrison was the duckling. Isabella the swan.
Now awake, Nathaniel returned to his true love.
A hollow laugh escaped her. This wasn't love - it was delusion. Nathaniel had never wanted her, yet she'd given everything. The first to love always loses.
Today, Nathaniel destroyed her completely.
Tears fell as she blew out the candles, plunging the mansion into darkness.
Suddenly, headlights cut through the night. Nathaniel's Rolls-Royce purred up the drive.
Harrison's breath caught. She hadn't expected him home tonight.
The door opened, Nathaniel bringing the night's chill with him.
Nathaniel Falcon - heir to Falcon Enterprises. A business prodigy who'd earned dual masters from Westfield by sixteen. He'd taken the company public in Willow Heights, becoming Willowbrook's wealthiest man before thirty.
""Why are you sitting in the dark?"" His baritone voice filled the space as lights flickered on.
Harrison blinked against the sudden brightness. When her vision cleared, she took him in - the impeccably tailored suit, the aristocratic bearing that haunted society women's dreams.
""It's your birthday.""
Nathaniel's handsome face remained impassive as he glanced at the table. ""I've told you not to bother with this.""
""Or is it just me you don't want celebrating with you?"" Harrison challenged.
His cold gaze flickered over her. ""Believe what you like.""
He turned toward the stairs.
Always so distant. Nothing could melt that icy exterior.
Harrison stood abruptly. ""I have a gift for you.""
Nathaniel didn't pause. ""I don't want it.""
A sad smile touched her lips. ""Nathaniel... I want a divorce.""
He froze mid-step, slowly turning. His dark eyes locked onto hers with startling intensity.
Chapter 2
Harrison met Nathaniel's gaze without flinching. Her voice carried quiet determination as she repeated, ""I want a divorce, Nathaniel. Did you enjoy your birthday present?""
Nathaniel didn't react. ""You're ending our marriage because I missed my birthday dinner?""
""Isabella's back, isn't she?""
At the mention of Isabella, Nathaniel's lips twisted into a sardonic smile. He closed the distance between them in one stride. ""Jealous?""

The youngest billionaire in Willowbrook radiated power with every movement. Harrison instinctively retreated until her back hit the cold wall.
Nathaniel caged her in, one hand planted beside her head. His muscular frame blocked all escape.
His piercing eyes bored into hers. ""The entire city knows Isabella was my choice. You schemed your way into this marriage when she left. Why the sudden conscience?""
Harrison's face paled.
Yes, Nathaniel had loved Isabella. Without that accident putting him in a coma, she'd never have become Mrs. Falcon.
She'd never forget the icy disappointment in his eyes when he woke and found her by his bedside.
Separate bedrooms. No intimacy.
He loved Isabella.
She'd always known this, but...
Harrison studied Nathaniel's face, superimposing the man before her with the boy from her memories.
'Nathaniel, do you really not remember me?'
She'd been waiting for someone who no longer existed.
Enough.
Three years of one-sided devotion.
Suppressing the ache in her chest, Harrison whispered, ""Let's end this farce of a marriage.""
Nathaniel's eyebrow arched. ""Farce?""
He seized her chin, thumb brushing her lower lip. ""Is that what this is about? You're frustrated?"" His voice dropped to a husky murmur. ""Need me that badly?""
Heat flooded Harrison's cheeks.
That wasn't what she meant!
Yet Nathaniel kept tracing her mouth with shocking intimacy. The usually composed billionaire had a wicked side.

He was seeing Harrison properly for the first time. Normally hidden behind oversized glasses and drab outfits, now he noticed her delicate features, the striking eyes behind those lenses.
Her lips were impossibly soft. Tempting.
A dangerous thought surfaced.
Nathaniel's gaze darkened. ""Who knew my proper wife was so desperate?""
Slap!
Harrison's palm connected with his cheek. Nathaniel's head snapped sideways.
Her hand trembled. Love shouldn't require sacrificing dignity. He'd crossed a line.
""I know you never stopped loving Isabella,"" she spat. ""Fine. You can have your precious Mrs. Falcon title back!""
Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. No one had ever struck him.
His voice dripped venom. ""You married me when it suited you. Now you'll divorce on a whim? What am I to you?""
Harrison laughed bitterly. ""A trophy.""
""What?""
""A prize I stole from Isabella."" She forced the words out, ignoring the pain. ""I'm bored now. Time to discard you.""
Nathaniel's face darkened. ""Fine! Don't come crawling back!""
He stormed upstairs, the study door slamming shut.
Harrison slid down the wall, hugging her knees. 'Nathaniel, I'm done loving you.'
Next morning, Beatrice entered the study.
Nathaniel was reviewing documents, the notorious workaholic.
""Sir?"" Beatrice approached cautiously.
He didn't look up. The air around him was frigid.
She set down a coffee. ""Mrs. Falcon made this.""
Nathaniel's pen stilled. The coffee he liked. Was this her apology?
Truthfully, Harrison was an impeccable wife—excellent cook, meticulous homemaker.
He took a sip. Perfect, as always.
But no. She'd slapped him. A coffee wouldn't suffice.
""Did she apologize?"" Nathaniel demanded.
Beatrice hesitated. ""Sir... Mrs. Falcon left.""
Nathaniel froze.
She handed him a document. ""She asked me to give you this.""
The words ""Divorce Agreement"" glared up at him.
His expression darkened. He'd thought this was reconciliation.
Beatrice added, ""She requested you finish the coffee before signing.""
Nathaniel glared at the cup. ""Throw it out!""
'But you were enjoying it moments ago,' Beatrice thought, swiftly removing it.
Nathaniel scanned the agreement. She wanted nothing—no alimony, no assets.
He scoffed. How would a small-town girl survive without his money?
Then he saw her handwritten reason for divorce:
""My husband suffers from erectile dysfunction and cannot perform marital duties.""
Nathaniel's face turned thunderous.
'That damn woman!'
He grabbed his phone and dialed Harrison.
She answered immediately. ""Yes?""",1,1757216253.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

I'm looking into it as an easier way to make espresso daily. Currently I use a moka pot and a Timemore Chestnut C2 (grind setting 14-16, 26 g coffee + 260 g water) and it's been fine enough during the week, but I'm considering switching my daily driver to a double espresso in the morning.

I used to do this with a Flair Classic setup with 2 brew cylinders and a 1Zpresso Q2 (16 g dose of medium-roast coffee, grind setting 28-32, 32-35 g out in 32-35 s) to learn the basics/advanced stuff. I just don't want to take the time during a weekday to do this because I need my mornings to move faster.

So does anybody have one of these machines? I'm not interested in burning any more money than I already have to get something like a Dedica, Stilosa, or any of the Casabrews machines, so that's why this caught my eye. If you have it, how do you like it? Are there any quirks/features I should be aware of? Do you have a user manual you're willing to share?

I appreciate the help.

1naiybd,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1naiybd/retroactive_trip_report/,Retroactive Trip Report,"This is a retroactive trip report to Las Vegas from when I went in March 2025.  This was my second trip in four months after many years away.  The reason for going was to see Dead and Company at the Sphere.  I had seen D&C a few times before in SoCal but wanted to finally see them at the Sphere after reading rave reviews online, both the show and the venue.  I had been watching prices and they were expensive but I finally saw a Thursday show was less pricey than the weekend.  My main incentive is to see the band and surprisingly for me it was cheaper to buy a ticket under the center rafters right behind GA because of the limited view of the Sphere.  It was great for me as it was the closest I had been to the band as in other places such a close seat would be much more expensive.

This was a solo trip for me. I also picked a show during the second week of March Madness so another event for me to enjoy at Vegas.  Took Thu/Fri off work, and left in my car from SoCal Thursday morning with no traffic.  I had a fondness from a previous stay at TI, and seeing its great value and location from the Sphere, that's where I was driving too.  Arrived early afternoon wearing a Dead shirt and as expected saw Deadheads around the casino too.  One gripe I had about check-in was they asked me for my cell phone number.  My response was what happened to anonymous check-in?  He said he needs to put something down.  I said just make up a number.  (I don't like how every business establishment asks for cell phone numbers now).  Checked into my room and it's about mid-afternoon now with some time to kill before the evening show.  I walk across to the Venetian and through the casino and then towards the shopping area entrance where the poker room is.  I cross the bridge to the Wynn and to the poker room there. Nearby is a small sports book, and so I decide to make a small March Madness bet, I think I picked the spread of the team playing Duke, thinking the casual fans would take them and I would fade that (I ended up winning and collected the next day).  Walked back to the Venetian and had a meal at a Mediterranean stand by the entrance to the Strip.

Then it was time to walk to the Sphere along the sidewalk outside.  I had seen the venue at night for the first time last year, but it was quite something to see it up close and then actually go inside.  I ended up sitting next to two middle-aged guys that I also believe were solo travelers.  One of them bought two drinks for the other guy, goes to show that you can find companionship in Vegas and at a concert even as a solo attendee.  The show itself was great and now perhaps one of my more memorable shows of the band.  

When the concert was over, as I predicted, they make you exit into the Venetian casino where I guess they hope you stay and gamble.  Sure enough at this point the casino was packed.  I have developed a recent fascination with craps and saw a table with other Deadheads having a go.  I wasn't going to play a run as I am a casual gambler and the $25 minimum is too high for me.  I did decide to play a single pass line bet and lost.  I like to go up to craps tables at different casinos that seem fun and just watch without playing and it seems no one ever seems to mind if I'm not in anybodys way.  I then walked back to TI and found a $15 table and played some actual rolls of the game, but it didn't go super long as I went down slightly here too.  Then I went to bed perhaps sometime after midnight.

Wake up Friday morning.  I have this hotel routine I like of getting breakfast downstairs in the hotel, including my coffee.  I have learned that there is a gripe with some travelers about the quality (or lack there of) of the coffee in the room, but I never notice this as I prefer getting my coffee downstairs.  I find a Starbucks and a small line of people also on their morning run. 

I will now have to share that in my quest to not spend too much money, I found that Friday night hotel prices were more expensive at TI so I had booked Friday night at the Rio.  In retrospect this was not worth the idea to save maybe $50.  And with the hassle of checking out, driving, and checking in again, I should have just stayed at TI. In anyways, I recognized the Rio from when the WSOP used to be on ESPN and I had never stayed there before.  But arriving there on a Friday afternoon I was shocked how empty it seemed, first indication seeing like hardly any cars in the parking structure.  Lobby and casino then inside was rather devoid of people. My room was rather big, but the first thing I noticed upon entering was a weird smell.  That's when I vowed to never stay here again and just spend the bit extra money to stay at a mid-tier place like TI and other hotels of that caliber. 

I will now share that my secondary goal of this trip after the concert was to try my hand at poker, which I was to do this evening.  The previous day I dropped by the rooms at the Venetian, Wynn, and Resorts World.  Those minimums were outside my casual gambling budget.  Now more mid-strip, I left the Rio late afternoon and walked to Caesars.  Went to the sports book as this was the second day of the Sweet Sixteen. Having been to Vegas for March Madness in years past, I was expecting a packed room for this well known casino.  There were still people there for the games, but maybe because it's so cavernous I guess it didn't feel packed.  I asked an employee where the Caesar's poker room was and he said it was closed for renovations and that I should go to the Horseshoe instead.  I decided that's where I would ultimately play because online recs said it was likely lower minimums.  But because I'm a curious tourist who likes walking, I wanted to check out the vibes at the more upscale poker rooms at the nearby Bellagio and Aria.  Yup, definitely upscale and definitely higher minimums, but the walk and tram rides were nice for sightseeing and people watching.

I walk across the Strip to the Horseshoe and find the poker room near where I entered.  The minimums where more in my range and so I put my name down for the lowest blind/no limit cash game.  Didn't have to wait long.  Place seemed well-attended at this time, despite my short wait time.  I played for maybe 45 minutes, won a hand or two.  I ended up losing my $100 though.  Not much of a story here as this is not a poker report, haha.  

It's about evening now and having accomplished what I wanted to do on my second day, it was time to wander.  I'm a music fan and remember stumbling last year upon an outdoor bar with a cover band, so I make my way over to the same Carnaval Court in between the Linq and Harrahs.  I get a drink and to my surprise find a $10 blackjack table on this Friday night.  It's good timing though because very soon the pit boss increases it but I get to stay at $10.  I end up losing my $100 over two dealers, but I enjoyed my time getting a buzz gambling and listening to the live band.  I will say the second dealer who came in dealt so fast I couldn't keep up with the count, and his machine-like approach and serious nature to dealing kind of soured me.  I even asked if he could slow down.  I would avoid dealers like this in the future because they kind of take the fun out of the human interaction of table games. 

After this I decided to find some non-restaurant food. I walk next door to Harrah's and get some to-go pizza at PizzaCake.  I take it and enjoy it outside the well-packed Dueling Piano Bar there, listening to the music without having to go in.

Some other observations I remember from my time in this area of the strip.  While outside the entrance to Carnaval Court, a lingering vagrant came up behind a woman and attempted to touch her, and immediately 2 or 3 military- dressed security jumped on him and took him away.  I think they were associated with Caesars as perhaps that area was company property and not the public Vegas street even though we were outside by the strip.  Another observation I remember hearing was someone remarking about the showgirls nearby asking for pictures and tips and that this is the oldest trick in Vegas and why anyone would fall for this.  I laughed to myself because this sure enough happened to me last year and I got had for more money in tips I would have liked to give, but it's a Vegas-learned experience I can laugh about now.

After my pizza at the Dueling Piano bar, I went back to the Rio and to my room for the night. I wake up Saturday morning and get coffee at the Starbucks (a nice line of people too, I guess people do stay at the Rio, they perhaps just don't spend any time there like I did).  I check out and drive back to SoCal.  No traffic at all on the way back because it's a Saturday morning going the other direction.

Overall, I had a great time.  I've done Vegas many times in the past with others (family/friends/work), but this was the first time going there completely solo.  It can be a nice change because you can set your own agenda and you can still do many of the same things.  It's still nice though to share vacation memories with others, and so I wrote this trip report to share this memory with you.  Thank you for reading.",8,1757216007.0,vegas,1,1.0,False

I’m losing my mind and I’m circulating back to my old self destructive ways because of it I think, I’ll explain.

So I’ve been in a maximum of 2 relationships, both ended pretty bad, the more recent one ended absolutely horrific, she literally broke up with me with an email and got mad when I forgot to unfollow her on Spotify, it was crazy! Anyway, I had spiraled pretty bad and was in a very bad suicidal state. I eventually met Ash who saved me, she kept coming to my house everyday and making sure I had things to do. Little did I know she was struggling with the same thing and it brought us closer.

We ended up having a weird friends with benefits or situation ship thing going on after around 3 months. It was a questionable decision but our chemistry was really clashing in a good way. We both were nerds on a fandom and that’s how we bonded, and then one day she said I looked like one of the characters, let’s call him Bill, in the dim lighting (we were both drunk) and we just started role playing with me as that character and her as herself if her and that character were in love or something. Weird, but hey I’m not one to kink shame and honestly I love figuring out what I’m into!

It lead to kissing, making out and more. She had a lot of sexual trauma and I was helping her through it, I thought. Then one day, maybe like 6-7 months of us knowing each other, she asked to date and I said yes.

It started off really well, we’d kiss and do all sorts of things but strictly in role playing because “it’s how we did things” and sometimes we just role played in general, no kissing no nothing, sometimes I’d even play an abusive role because she liked it (first thing I noticed that was off).

She liked degrading the most from what I could tell and whatever. Sometimes she’d do some of my kinks (I like power dynamics and leashes, not really pet play it’s more degrading I guess but on a deeper level) and I really liked when she’d let me be a bottom! It was nice, and it kept things flowing with us.

Then one day, she admitted that she only felt comfortable with me touching her in role play. That shattered me, but I understood. She has maladaptive daydreaming and the role plays are considered a part of her imagination, not even a kink at that point. I realized I was her coping mechanism.

I acted fine over it and we slowly have been moving forward. However, she also doesn’t say I love you much to me, she hates cuddling, she always uses the excuse that she’s hot even if it’s freezing cold, but in role play she’s all over me and hates when I move away. She’s also a very dry texter. I thought it was good to mention. 

Now, she’s been getting very involved with Twitter/X at the moment. I didn’t worry to much, until I saw was she was reading. Gore p*rn stories, sex with underage and/or dead bodies stories, etc. about the character, Bill, she always made me play.

When I confronted her, she freaked out a bit and admitted to other kinks. She has a pisskink too. Again, not one to kink shame, and she’s also hypersexual. I get it, so am I due to my own sexual trauma, but she purposefully indulges in those things she calls disgusting but she says they also give her that feeling that turns her on. She says she’s disgusted with herself but didn’t stop looking even after I quietly advised maybe looking at those things weren’t helping.

Instead of getting off it like I said, she made a friend with the same problems and a massive issue with self harm. You see, me and Ash have both had issues with this and I’ve had my fair share of gore as well (referring to the gore from earlier) but it was more because I accidentally stumbled across it and got addicted.

This person she met, let’s call him Jasper, he was a trans man who’s hypersexual, constantly talking about his kinks online, and also had an obsessive with that Bill character and Ash and them realized they had a lot more in common, more in common than me and Ash ever were. That alone stressed me out, but with the details it scares me.

I asked if I could meet Jasper because other than those things, he seemed pretty cool and I honestly love meeting new people especially those I can talk and relate to, so I asked Ash and she said to me “I honestly was going to make a sad excuse but since your basically my best friend, just… no.” So I asked her why and she said “I finally feel special, and I finally have a friend to myself. I don’t have to share anything like that with you.”

That kinda stung, but yeah okay that’s fair. But it was more because she was losing sleep every night because Jasper was on the other side of the earth and they had different time zones. Every time me and Ash would talk, she’d say “I’ve been waiting for Jasper to come back online” or “I told Jasper about that inside joke we have” I guess it’s just a lot for me, she’s sharing so much with someone like that but hardly saying a word to me now.

It doesn’t end there, because she started telling me she’d carve my name into her thigh. I’ve told her that I used to have issues with self control revolving around self harm and I have mentioned that thanks to the therapy I get I have enough self control to not cut someone’s initials into me like I wanted to. Mental illness can do terrible things to the brain that want to do things like that for the people you love.

Ash said that we could both do it, and I said maybe we should, but then that self control came back and I told her that what she was saying was very wrong and that Twitter is ruining how she saw love even more than before. 

She didn’t apologize and just said that’s how she felt. Well, last night I couldn’t sleep. I woke up at like 3:35 or something and just couldn’t go back to sleep, so I scrolled on my phone for a bit and Ash sent me a message at 5 saying she couldn’t sleep either.

She said she wanted to text role play and she wanted me to be that Bill guy, I sleepily agreed and it ended up like this: the storyline, she was drunk and was hitting on him and said very sexual things about what she wanted him to do to her. I made Bill say things like “please go to bed I’m uncomfortable”, in our other chat Ash sent me a very unimpressed message “wow. Thanks for ruining the plot.” 

I wanted to tell her that seducing someone without their consent online is not how it works and by any means realistic, but before I could say anything she said “I’ll just give her a sad twist” i was like oh my god no…

“I used to send my fresh scars to boys so they’d tell me they love me” she said to me aka Bill. She started saying worse things I won’t say on here and I started to tear up because I knew these were things she didn’t feel comfortable enough to say to me, so I messaged her in our other chat room and said that she can always talk to me and she just said “I’m fine” so I left it at that.

Then she told me we should do a call right there right now even tho I could be trying to get to sleep and relaxing, but instead I got a stressful phone call that I sadly agreed to.

She said that I need to compliment her and tell her all these good things to make her feel better and comfort her. So I did just that and then I just went quiet because I was sobbing. It was getting to much, knowing she was struggling and not even getting help for it and just indulging. 

She asked why I was quiet and I just said “I don’t know what else to say.” So she instructed me on what to say, so I said it all. Then I went quiet, for about ten minutes and so did she. Then I said in a quiet voice, “I love you”

She immediately said, “I love you too, Bill.” And that was my breaking point, I just hung up on her, messaged that it was meant for her not her character, and just cried. I’m sitting here, drinking my coffee and wondering why I didn’t do things differently. 

I told her this morning that I couldn’t role play anymore, that it was for my mental health because the themes she kept bringing up were to triggering for my mental health and that I’m doing this so I wouldn’t commit suicide

Her response?

“Okay”

JUST OKAY.

I just put my phone on do not disturb and played Zelda and didn’t eat anything except a cookie and some water.

I even sent her an I love you message earlier and she didn’t respond for ten minutes, so I asked her if she was okay and she just started ranting about her mum or something worrying about her and she said that she was fine (total lie and she knew it) and didn’t understand why they were asking…

So um…

Do I break up with her or get her professional help?",1,1757215399.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Not close friends. Just acquaintances initially thru work and became friends for about 2 years plus. He is married to a man my age. They are well off. Have several homes in different countries. We would call up each other for coffee occasionally whenever I'm in town (we live in different cities) and chat and he'd tell me frivolous things like what to do with his life as he just bought a couch worth $10,000 and it wouldn't fit in through the door of his apartment. I then mentioned to him one day that I recently met a young man, S(25). I showed him this guy's IG and he said that he's cute. Anyway, a few months later when my bf and I were together we were chatting about meeting my friend and his husband for dinner.. and that's when my bf said that A messaged him on IG a few weeks back. He just said to him that he knows about him through me and asked if he'd like to meet him for drinks. It wasn't even to say that let's wait till I get into town and we all could go out together ..which I think that would be the correct way. He just said just him and my bf meet. My bf politely declined but didn't mention it to me till that evening cos he thought nothing of it. We did go out for dinner with A and his husband and me with S. It was pleasant..no awkward moments. As A mentioned that they'd be moving to their new house they built later that year, I bought them a bottle of champagne. After dinner, we said out goodbyes and the usual, we'll keep in touch etc etc. Then...crickets. They moved into their new house, had a housewarming party with lots of their friends but we weren't invited. I decided not to contact A again to see if he would reach out and he never did after that night. Recently a mutual friend's husband of ours passed and I messaged A to tell him. He thanked me and I said to him when I will be town next and said to him, let's keep in touch. But he hasn't. Initially I thought that it's me. But do you think it's cos he knows that I know that he fools around, and not only he tried to pick up my bf and it's embarrassing for him to meet me again?

Shot 1 - no side effects. Food noise disappears (finally understood what that was!) and appetite was suppressed. Lost 3 pounds.

Shot 2 - 10-15 min after the shot, a wave of anxiety hits me. I’ve had issues with anxiety and panic attacks during my life so I know what it is. I tend to get hit with one if I have too much caffeine or too little sleep. Neither was true that day. I didn’t think much of it. No other side effects, less food suppression, cravings are back, but lost 3 months. 

Shot 3 - again, 10-15 min after the shot, a wave of anxiety. Now I’m starting to wonder if it’s connected to the medication. I also develop slight nausea and then heartburn later in the day. I also feel like I’ve had too much coffee for the rest of the day. 

I’m not nervous about giving the shot. I actually look forward to it because it makes me less hungry.

I started this day out brutal. I mean fuming mad. I was dysphoric and upset and just ....awful. It was because of my very stubborn and very much so now no contact ""father"". I asked him for a simple bit of respect for what I was going through, even offered him a middle ground to call me something like ""bud or dude or homie or (insert relatively harmless and gender neutral names here)"" something anything ya know? I told him I said this is your last chance or Im blocking you again (he only got unblocked cause my grandmother bless her soul thinks hes a saint among men but she doesnt know the half of it but now that hes out of the picture, shes gonna be told EVERY LAST DETAIL)......and all this cause I just want a little mutual understanding and respect considering hes always demanding some form of respect for his beliefs but refuses to respect anyone elses. So the conversation happens, 2 texts exchanged. He decided to be a butt, so I was one back. While I regret the wording of my message I do not regret the message itself. I am a woman of my word and I had told him that if he was going to be this way I was going to drop his name and go get it changed right away to something else (maybe my Mommas last name? Idk). I am now planning on calling the courthouse monday. Among all of the chaos there came order when I told him that I hope he found some form of contentment in his life but I was going to have no part of it or his side of the family (again very not good people, ask me about it in the comments and I will elaborate or give a brief idea) and I said Goodbye Mr.(dead last name). So among all that rage and chaos in the end, I still had the courtesy to call him mister and wished him a good life. I proceeded to have coffee with my Momma, we call her Momma Phantom in my community, and we discussed several things, from him and how he changed from 2021 till now, we talked religion(s), spirituality, transitioning, history, family (the ones I care about), etc. By the end....I was happy.

Earlier today I ran into a neighbor at a local coffee house. I’ve known her for years and although we aren’t close friends, we’ve always been very friendly.

She’s married and in her mid 60s. After a while, she if dating is going well for me and she said something that took me by complete surprise. She suggested I put on weight. I’m active and fit. I’m a little under 5’3” and weigh 138 on average(I’m generally between 135 and 142).

She said “You should think about putting on 15-20 pounds. A lot of women aren’t going to want a guy that weighs less than them especially if he’s really short” when I raised an eyebrow, she explained her rationale. She felt that it would make them self-conscious about their own weight.

I’m shaking my head as I’m currently at the high end of normal weight for someone my height. 20 pounds would put me significantly overweight and close to obese(using BMI, which I think is a poor measure of health).

FYI: It’s not something I’d do. I’m at a healthy weight and I’m not going to chance that just to get a date.

I'm almost 27, male, had to return living with my mom, and now working as a waiter. I was in a pretty good uni, but my grades are so bad that I wont get accepted on other establishments and even if that wasn't the case, its too late to re-orient because academic year already started a week ago.

I have no gf, all my friends already graduated and are far away. I had a previous job that allowed me to have money so I could live by myself, but I let it go so I could move back to with my mother. It paid well, but its that kind of job where you never progress and is basically doing 0 brain effort all day, just being present. Working felt like a waste of time (again, even if it was 20 eur/hour!!). If I stayed, it would definitely feel like mental death. On top of that I'm like super out of shape and this waiter job is so time consuming and tiring that i cannot go to the gym or even work out, because I will definitely end with a serious injury if I do that.

Like for the past 2 months, I've been working 11 hours a day, everyday, with 1 day off out of 64. My excuse for staying here is that I'm not European and my visa is about to expire. My boss knows and he can take advantage of it. but the real reason I'm accepting this shit is firstly because It feel like this is what I deserve and secondly, most importantly and mainly because it keeps my brain distracted from reality. Otherwise I will spend my days overthinking and crying at myself because of my situation. It is all messed up.

I feel like a complete failure. I know I have qualities, I know that I'm not just a bum, and that I'm not a parasite of society because I actually try and work, but lowkey that's what gets me mad af. Because even if I did do a lot of things these past 7 years (I even speak 5 languages now), they feel like they are not compatible with each other and that at the end my effective/usable experience equates to 0. On top of that my mom thinks I drug myself which I don't fucking understand. I don't even drink alcohol because I know that I need every damn neuron of my brain if I want to get somewhere. I don't like cigarettes and the only times i drank coffee was during finals week, but we know that's over. And it's not like I would have the fucking time either, like WHEN?? I'm either sleeping, eating or working at that stupid restaurant. it's like I'm being judged for the only thing I don't do wrong.

I also cant help feeling like she is just saying that to justify my failures, which means in her eyes I'm a useless junkie. No mom, this isn't drugs, this is my stupid brain (Also ironically my most successful friends are high 24/7).

All my friends have successful jobs, they are buying houses, and those who don't at least have their rich families so they can start over as many times as they like. Meanwhile me, I'm basically getting exploited and I really don't have anywhere to go.

I do have a goal, which is becoming financially stable, with a respectable income, with at least a house. But even the first part seems unattainable.

I feel like I've run out of time to prove I'm worth something and that society will slowly push me into misery, living with a shitty entry job forever.

I know I sound like someone that needs to go to the psy, but I tried that and it SUCKED big time. I hated my doctor, it was boring and expensive (70 euros per consult!!). The only reason I didn't skip my meeting was because it hurt to lose that money and not even go.

I had high expectations of myself, and I feel that now its too late to become anything other than a minimum wage worker.

He liked me and he seemed like my type so I matched with him. We had a good convo on the app for a few days where he responded quickly and seemed very interested, so I asked him out for coffee. 


We had a great coffee date. We sat talking for almost 4 hours and I had to be the one to say okay we should probably get going! I’ve been on a lot of first dates and this was the best one I’ve been on by far, I felt very comfortable with him already. I asked if he wanted my number and he said yes. When he got home he immediately texted me and said he had a great time and would be down for more, and that he also felt comfortable with me. Later that night he asked when I would be free for another date, and we picked a day. 


I didn’t hear from him for a few days, and on the day of the date I texted him asking what the plan was. He replied and said “I could see you more as a friend. I don’t want to waste your time.” This seemed like a complete 180 to how he was acting during/after our first date. I was shocked to hear that but told him thanks for letting me know and I wished him the best. 


I’m not unattractive by any means and he had complimented my appearance multiple times, calling me pretty and cute. He seemed interested and was the one to ask me out on another date so I don’t know what changed. I am wondering if he got cold feet or why else he would change his mind. 


It’s been a few days and I’ve been wondering if I should shoot my shot and text him again, saying something like “Hey, I just wanted to tell you that I thought our date went so well and I would love to keep getting to know you. I’m not in a rush and I’m okay with being friends at first. I’ve been thinking about you a lot and thought I might as well let you know how I’m feeling. If you would still be down for another date let me know, otherwise no need to respond to this.” Men, would that be flattering or creepy? Should I shoot my shot or just take the L and move on?

1naifj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowMyBusinessNow/comments/1naifj1/funding_secrets_revealed_how_to_bootstrap_your/,Funding Secrets Revealed: How to Bootstrap Your Startup Using Free & Low-Cost Alternatives,"**Funding Secrets Revealed: How to Bootstrap Your Startup Using Free & Low-Cost Alternatives**

Dreaming of launching that killer app or opening that quirky coffee shop, but your bank account looks more like a sad, neglected piggy bank? You're not alone! Many of us start with a brilliant idea and a whole lot of hustle, but limited capital. Forget the angel investors for now. Let's dive into bootstrapping: building your business on a shoestring, using free and low-cost alternatives. This guide is your secret weapon to funding your dreams without selling your soul (or your car).

**The Challenge:** Tight Budgets & Big Dreams

Starting a business is inherently risky, and convincing investors to part with their cash can be tougher than herding cats. Many small businesses face the initial hurdle of proving their concept *without* significant funding. Applying for loans often requires established credit and proven profitability, which you likely don’t have when starting out. This leaves many entrepreneurs feeling stuck, forced to delay their launch or compromise on their vision. But there's a better way!

**Unlocking Growth: Your Bootstrapping Blueprint**

Okay, let's get down to brass tacks. Bootstrapping is all about resourcefulness, creativity, and leveraging every free or low-cost tool available. Here's your roadmap to launching and growing your business on a lean budget:

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Embrace the Power of Free & Freemium**
    *   **Free Marketing:** Ditch expensive ad campaigns (for now!). Focus on organic social media growth, content marketing (blog posts, how-to guides, videos), and email marketing using free platforms like Mailchimp (free up to a certain subscriber limit).
    *   **Free Productivity Tools:** Don't shell out hundreds for software. Google Workspace offers a suite of free tools (Docs, Sheets, Slides) that are perfect for collaboration and document creation. Trello (free plan available) is fantastic for project management.
    *   **Free Design Resources:** Need a logo or marketing materials? Canva (free plan) offers templates and design tools for creating professional-looking visuals without hiring a designer.

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Become a Master of Bartering & Networking**
    *   **Barter, Baby!** Exchange your skills or services with other businesses. Need website design? Offer your social media management expertise in return.
    *   **Network, Network, Network!** Attend local business events, join online communities (like this one!), and connect with other entrepreneurs. You never know who might offer invaluable advice, support, or even a partnership. Local chambers of commerce often have free or low-cost networking events.
    *   **Pro-Tip:** Be specific about what you're looking for when networking. ""I'm looking for a mentor in the food industry"" is far more effective than a general ""I want to network.""

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Optimize Your Online Presence (SEO)**
    *   **Claim Your Google Business Profile:** It's free, and it helps local customers find you online. Fill it out completely, add photos, and ask for reviews.
    *   **Keyword Research is Key:** Use free keyword research tools (like Google Keyword Planner or Ubersuggest – free limited version) to identify relevant keywords for your website and content. Optimize your website and content with these keywords to improve your search engine ranking.
    *   **Pro-Tip:** Focus on long-tail keywords (phrases with multiple words). They have less competition and can attract highly targeted traffic. Example: ""best organic coffee beans Seattle"" instead of just ""coffee.""

*   **Step-by-Step or Key Points: Leverage the Gig Economy for Affordable Talent**

Incredibly silky and elegant with date sweetness, milk chocolate, and creamy coffee notes. The finish was long with a lingering nuttiness on the palate and a creamy smoke texture. An extraordinary smoke, would love to have again if not for the price tag. 

Ended the night with the Padron Black from the CRA 2024 sampler. This one started off creamy, nutty, and smooth and crescendoed to that well known Padron Maduro flavor. Milder overall than expected, but had some good musty earth, dark roast coffee, and black pepper notes.

I updated my calculations slightly, I didn't realize the half life was 29.9 days, not 30 days, which makes it slightly faster, lol. Of course that varies based on the individual's metabolism, but I can't know my own, so I'm just estimating by the published average half life.

I've noticed continuation of uncontrollable facial movements, such as opening my mouth or moving my jaw or putting my tongue to the back corner of my mouth and lightly biting when thinking or focusing really hard. The people around me seem to have... warmed up? for lack of a better expression. I think I've become more and more... expressive, perhaps? I move faster (""psychomotor retardation"" is improved) when I need to, though I still favor moving slowly when focusing or making a decision.

LOTS of blurry vision, I put a fresh pair of contacts in my eyes and I still have a hard time seeing certain things. I attribute this to dry eyes firstly, and secondly, I think my eyes may be getting better or worse with the nearsightedness. I held my phone up to my eyes with no contacts in or glasses, and it was still blurry, so I'm not sure it's 100 percent just dry eyes. I'm hoping the extra nearsightedness I developed on abilify is healing.

You may notice a difference from my earlier posts, which is that I'm complaining and mentioning my anger less. The irritation, overwhelm, and akathisia have subsided mostly! I quit the propranolol, since my sporadic dosing was making that worse.

BUT I am crying from 1-3 times a day. I don't think I'm depressed, since I have started engaging in more duties like chores, homework, exercise, without struggle. I'm still a bit demotivated when it comes to my hobbies, and I haven't felt the need to play video games lately, though I am enjoying music very much. I don't feel particularly pained when I cry, just sad about some things, like the 3 close loved ones I lost last December, or about the years I've lost to schizophrenia and how I see those lost years being redeemed at best, or accepted at worst. I'd say about a third of the tears are from being overwhelmed with emotions other than sadness, like listening to a good song, thinking about someone I love, or being grateful about something.

But certainly not agonizing tears of depression or self-pity. They are tears of healing. I think I cried twice today and I'll probably cry again. Yesterday I cried a lot because I realized how much disconnection there is between my body and my mind. I laid in bed for 2 hours, listening to the most relaxing music I know, feeling generally very calm, and then remembering how my legs get so tense they are shaking, and that my shoulders are stiff. Finally got my muscles to unclench. If I can figure that out, I will be at a great advantage. I feel my propensity towards psychosis is worse when my body feels inherently unsafe.

Still struggling with insomnia. I've developed a caffeine sensitivity so strong that I can no longer have even decaf coffee. To be fair, I could barely tolerate it before; it just seems worse now.

Overall, I can still confidently say I've been through much worse.",2,1757213826.0,Abilify_Aripiprazole,1,1.0,False

I ordered an iced vanilla latte with oat milk, light whip. Nothing wild. The barista took my order and moved on to the next customer.

The guy behind me — maybe late 40s, business casual with a bluetooth earpiece he definitely wasn’t using — chuckled and said, loud enough for me and the barista to hear:

“Guess we’re just putting dessert in cups and calling it breakfast now.”

I didn’t turn around. I just smiled and said,

“Guess we’re still making comments no one asked for.”

He ignored that and kept going.

“I mean, it’s no wonder people are tired all the time. Empty sugar, empty habits, empty conversations. But hey, at least it’s pretty, right?”

At this point the barista froze, clearly uncomfortable. I turned to face him. Calm, even voice.

“It must be hard, waking up every day to a family that resents how small you make everything around you feel. But if condescending to strangers helps, I won’t get in your way.”

The barista audibly whispered “oh my god.”

He blinked. Didn’t say a word. Just looked away. When they called his name, he grabbed his black coffee and left without thanking anyone.

The barista handed me my latte with a smile and said it was on the house.

Turns out, bitterness doesn’t need sugar to be unbearable.

1nai26b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1nai26b/im_tired_boss/,"I’m tired, boss.","I’m taking care of Sweetie’s 97 year old dad, who has been in hospice care for the last 2 and a half years. We have a routine. Every day I wake up, get a cup of coffee and steel myself to go down to his room and see if this is the morning I find he died quietly in his sleep. Then I give him a big hug, give him his pills, change his briefs and do a few other routine maintenance and comfort things and let him go back to sleep. It wears on you after a while.

Thursday we had a crisis. He’s still somewhat mobile; we walk him about fifteen feet from his bedroom to the sitting room next to it, with both of us giving him support on his walker, Sweetie from the front and me from behind, and I have a stool with me if he needs to sit and take a rest. Only on Thursday I didn’t get the stool under him in time, and we lowered him to the floor. Where we then realized this wasn’t just a matter of his legs giving out. His eyes were open, but he wouldn’t respond to his name, and he started to drool. We called the hospice, and we got him laid out on the floor with a blanket under him and pillows for his head while we waited for the nurses to arrive.

I sat with him, holding his hand and calling his name while Sweetie went to the garage to look for a Hoyer lift that he knows is there somewhere, (left over from when his mom was disabled, that we haven’t dug out because the hospice service would provide a better one when the time comes, but that we didn’t have yet because who expects the time to come this abruptly) and also to be upstairs and ready to let the nurses in when they arrived. And even as Tato started to come around and it became clear this wasn’t a stroke or seizure, that it wasn’t the end, I had the thought that *this is what it’s going to be like, with me holding his hand and stroking his shoulder and murmuring comforting things to him.*

The nurses came and worked their usual miracles, assessed him and determined that he’d likely just fainted, and helped get him cleaned up and resettled back into his bed (don’t fuck with nurses, those two ladies just picked him up like it was nothing) and we came up with the plan that…he’s just not walking anywhere anymore. Transfer chair only, from room to room. He’s disappointed, but accepting. A new lift was ordered. They left, and we set to cleaning up. I’ve left out the gory details, but there was poop, there was vomit, as well as all the blankets, wipes, and other things scattered across the floor. It’s a mess when people pass out.

I didn’t cry until this morning, after a dream in which, long story short, my father and I rushed an adorable corgi with a bleeding wound to an emergency vet, where we were stymied by needing to fill out paperwork while the poor thing’s panting grew fainter and fainter. Thank goodness my alarm went off and woke me before I could find out if my dreaming brain was really going to make me watch it bleed out; my first reaction was relief that there was no corgi dying in my lap, then I immediately cried for a bit as it was obvious what the dream was really about. Then I got up, and went downstairs to get a cup of coffee.

I’m tired boss. It’s hard watching someone die slowly. I’ve been tearing up randomly all day, and I needed to write this out. Sweetie was in the room when his mom died, and it broke him for a while; and if he needs to distance himself with his dad’s death for his own sake, even if it’s only by 20 feet, then I will spare him that if I can.

1nai13j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nai13j,7 days / solo travel,"Just returned from my first trip to Iceland(8/29-9/5), had an absolutely lovely time! I see a lot of questions here about packing, so this is my take. (For what it’s worth, I’m a single, mid 30s, plus size, queer woman and this is my POV):

🧳Packing:
Glad I brought:
-travel adapter charger for hotel/airport
-cigarette car charger adapter 
-portable USB powered travel fan (got a bit stuffy at night)
-reusable water bottle
-small foldable cooler: kept my car food cold!
Wish I brought:
-Another TShirt. I brought warmer layers but not enough lighter ones!
-Binoculars - purely forgot. 

🍎 Food:
-I found that a lot of (not all of!) the pricing was pretty similar to where I’m located in the US. Example: Coffee and pastry around $15
-I bought a loaf of bread, peanut butter, lunch meat, the Skyr yogurt packets, fruit/veg, electrolyte packets and was set for several meals on the road. 
-I did eat out appx 1x/day, and many of my stays included free breakfast. 
-my car rental company provided me with a booklet or coupons, several for free drip coffees at N1 fast stations. I used this every day and bought some milk, worked perfectly for on the go caffeine. 

🏨Lodging/Transport:
-2 nights in standard hotels, 1 night in a “resort”, and 3 in shared guesthouses. Pros and cons to all, I really enjoyed the variety and felt safe at all of them. 
-I rented a car with the platinum insurance package and it included WiFi. The peace of mind was worth every penny to me. This also included a discount keychain for gas discount at N1 gas stations. 
-I recommend downloading Parka app if you have a rental car. 

⭐️Activities:
-I opted to forgo some of the entire Ring Road and have no regrets. Some of my favorite moments were random pull off’s or lesser known places (with no crowds). 
- I only booked 2 activities: one was a sunset kayaking trip and another was a reservation for a hot spring. This allowed me to relax and not feel so pressured for time. 
-some of tourist behavior was really awful. Climbing all over the flora, crazy lines due to people in full photo shoot mode at the waterfalls, litter, and the drones! 

💲Money/Other:
-I paid for most of my lodging with hotel points. 
-I used mostly CapOne and Chase CCs. I only needed to use my debit card twice when the gas pump wouldn’t recognize my credit card pins. 
-Apple pay almost everywhere. 
-overall besides lodging, my highest cost was gas. My rental was a hybrid which helped!
-Most helpful apps: Parka, Aurora, and calculator conversion function. 

Overall, my trip was perfect. I found that the people
of Iceland were very helpful and lovely. Hope someone finds this helpful 😊

1nai0zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1nai0zx/issues_and_needing_to_vent/,Issues and Needing to Vent,"So for this I am omitting unimportant details and genders to maintain mine and my partners anonymity. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just a place to let it out and maybe have someone listen.

I am in a committed relationship and me and my partner have been chosen each other twice in life. The first there were numerous issues that caused us to lose touch and we got together a second time when the time was right and have been together in the long haul since then. Fast forward to the beginning of 2025 and we decided to take the leap and join the local lifestyle community where we live, it’s not like an out of left field decision for us we had talked about the idea for several years and it was an exciting and fun step for us. As the year has happened we have grown and enjoyed it more and more and it’s been wonderful and things have felt good up until a series of events. The first was we decided to set roots and buy a home together, then we had a random connection while out the lead to group activities. After this is when we made the step into polyamory. While after some soul searching I realized I always had been and just been suppressing in myself. My partner did the same but a bit earlier than I. Around this same time my partner started treating my differently but not in an expanding relationship and growing as two beings way but as in a slowly cutting me out way.

They stopped communicating or trying too, we went on a trip that we had planned for years and then spent the trip treating myself, our friends, and themselves horribly because they decided they wanted a boundary of the weekend of being free to do anything they wanted and not have to be tied to me or our friends. This is something I would’ve had not problem with if we had a conversation but instead it was told to me in anger. After the weekend as we were getting ready to leave my partner flat out refused to help with anything and stayed far away while glaring at me. The next day they had informed me that they had been told I had looked like someone else who was a piece of shit and just immediately decided it was me and that’s why they had treated me like this. After that revelation we had a long talk once we arrived home.

With that long talk my partner defended their believing what they were told as to me having been a piece of shit at home. They felt I was attempting to be controlling by using my emotions as a weapon among other things. Over the time since then I have been talking with my therapist about this and working to be better at controlling my emotions and making sure they know and have everything they need to be free to go where they feel and do what they need without me in their way. I’ve also explained more so where my emotions are coming from and that I want the discomfort they bring to help me grow more. All the while they accuse me of gaslighting then will gaslight me. Get mad about me wanting to spend small amounts of money on food or coffee while they will spend 200+ on an evening going out on their own (please note I’m happy they are going out on their own but I’m mad about the amount spent while they complain about money issues we are actually having). We used to have a highly physical relationship filled with positivity (and I don’t just meant sexually physical, holding hands, random touches while walking by, kisses, cuddles, just love through physical touch) and that has mostly disappeared while I’m pushed to doing most of the work while working 10+ hours daily in a physically and mentally exhaustive job and being in full time school. I come home to cold shoulders and being rebuked at every move. We have a date night coming up and I want to look forward to it but I know there will be something I do “wrong” that will cut the evening short or they will start to have fun then remember they are with me and basically just stop (this has happened a lot quite recently).

It’s frustrating because I am working on myself, encouraging them to do the same, trying to help rebuild what had been damaged and I’m feeling more lonely than ever. I’ve even let growing connections fall at this point to focus on this. From the beginning of our ENM/Poly journey we have always been straight that this is our primary relationship (we are/were working towards a kitchen table garden hybrid setup) and with that there is freedom to explore every connection either one of us feels. We just want to be open about what’s up so that we can talk about it be sure we are supportive but I’m feeling less supported than ever while I’m doing everything I can for them on every level. And this has been going on for months. I know they have had issues with my emotions and how they can present and work for them has been tough but I’m lost as to what I should or need to do next and I’m not ready to give up on this. Especially because seeing them grow has been the most amazing and beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, even though I’ve only been getting glimpses the last several months.",2,1757213035.0,nonmonogamy,1,1.0,False

* Stripes: Initially feared him, but grew to admire his honor and gentleness.
* Aishen: Shares a love of cooking — their friendship thrives on respect and creativity. 🍳
* Dara: Finds her clingy (especially when she cuddles him while he’s resting 😅), but respects her as a friend despite her demonic powers.

📜 Backstory

Jamal Biro grew up in Oko Fields, far from the chaos of the Apex World. Known as The Gamer of the Apex, he spent his life surrounded by video games, sports, and his game store job, where he spread joy by sharing games with others.
His life changed the summer J began his Apex World journey — Jamal was shocked to see his childhood friend as a T. Rex hybrid but stayed loyal, never abandoning him. Though not as powerful as the hybrids, Jamal’s wisdom, humor, and kindness made him a bridge between humans and hybrids.
He doesn’t seek glory; instead, he enjoys his job, cooks amazing food, supports his friends, and lives as proof that even in a world of titans and demons, a normal human can matter.

Let me tell you, if you’re stuck in that routine, you’re missing out on something huge. We're living in an age where AI is not just some sci-fi concept—it's here and ready to change the game. Seriously, it’s like a gold rush out there, and we’ve got the shovels to dig our own claims. So, let’s chat about how to **build your AI content empire** before the rush leaves us all behind. 💰

Here’s the reality: 

- **Content creation is changing.** Traditional methods take time—time you could be using to create, innovate, and, let’s be real… relax a little! 
- **AI tools are more accessible than ever.** Whether it’s creating blogs, social media posts, or even eBooks, there’s a tool for that (or 50!). Why not leverage these powerhouses?
- **You get to work on your terms**. Wanna write at 3 AM in your pajamas? Go for it! Or say goodbye to the commute and work from a beach in Bali. Sounds heavenly, right?

But wait, you might be thinking... **“Where do I even start?”** Don't sweat it! 

Here’s a quick cheat sheet: 

1. **Find your niche.** What are you passionate about? Tech? Fitness? Cats wearing hats? 🐱🎩 
2. **Choose your AI tools.** Play around with options like ChatGPT (hey, that’s us!) for brainstorming or Jasper for writing assistance. Use them to help amplify *your* unique voice.
3. **Content production.** Set up a schedule that works for you. Maybe dedicate Mondays for blogs, Wednesdays for social media, and Fridays for… well, whatever you feel like! 🎨
4. **Build your audience.** Start sharing what you create. Platforms like Medium, LinkedIn, or even TikTok could become your playground! 
5. **Iterate and pivot.** If something isn’t working—scrap it! And if it’s working—double down and grow your empire! 🏰 

Picture this: you wake up, grab your favorite coffee, and know that the day is yours. You're not answering to a boss or stuck in a dull meeting about spreadsheet margins. Instead, you’re creating content that lights you up, engages people, and best of all—it can be profitable. 

And let’s not forget the power of community! Being a part of a group like **AiContentAutomators** can spark so many ideas, support, and collaboration. Who knows? Your next big project might just come from a conversation with fellow members!

So, if you’re thinking about ditching the 9-to-5, now’s the time. The doors to your AI content empire are wide open—will you walk through them? 

Just remember, in this brave new world, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Every journey will look kinda different. And that’s what makes it exciting! ✨

This Is Not A Drill! 💸📱,"Okay, this might sound absolutely insane, but… GUYS. I made **$100 IN A WEEK** just from my PHONE, literally sitting in my bed, testing random apps.

Like, this is NOT an ad. I still can’t believe it and I did it myself. ????

I needed some side cash because my wallet started looking like a ghost town and, honestly, I kept seeing these weird app-testing gigs popping up but ignored them. (Scam vibes, right?) But THIS TIME I bit the bullet and one link changed EVERYTHING: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** 

Here's exactly how it all went down:

- I downloaded (no joke) like 6 weird-sounding apps at first and put up with some super wonky games, fitness setups, and even a budgeting tracker for three days.
- Every time I finished a task, I’d just go back and submit quick feedback like “Okay this button doesn’t work lol” or “The font is ugly.” 
- The money started racking up SO FAST??? Like, $5 here, $12 there… suddenly I could ACTUALLY afford an iced latte AND groceries in the same week.
- YES, I cashed out—real, actual money into my account. Not gift cards or some janky points system.

The magic was 100% at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** — the place where I found all the app requirements. My roommate thought I was faking it until I sent her my Venmo screenshot. PICK YOUR JAW OFF THE FLOOR.

Literally zero experience needed. You don’t code? Doesn’t matter! I just had to be honest about what annoyed me about the apps. Sometimes they even HIGH FIVE you for being annoyed lol. 

The best part?

- NO Zoom calls. I look like a gremlin when I work from bed, so THANK YOU.
- Choose the weirdest hours—2AM, 6PM, whenever you feel it.
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** didn’t spam my inbox either, which… thank you for respecting my sanity.

I honestly wish I believed in these before, but $100 a week is no joke for someone who wants side money for, I don’t know, coffee, streaming, Netflix, or (me) asthma inhalers and serotonin. Your phone becomes a MONEY MACHINE, I swear.

Thoughts? Who else tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and smacked the “wait is this LEGIT” phase like I did? Or do you have other app test sites that ACTUALLY pay in cold, hard cash? Not crypto? Not ONE PIECE per feedback? Real dollars. 

Drop your wildest side hustle results because I’ve never been so **hyped** (and simultaneously confused) about my screen time! 

Get in and let me know: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. If you get rich, don't forget about me when you're famous, K?",1,1757212144.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False
1nahqlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trendinfo/comments/1nahqlg/lost_in_the_aliexpress_matrix_when_deals_feel_too/,🎭 Lost in the AliExpress Matrix: When Deals Feel Too Cheap to Be Real but You Click Anyway 🛒✨,"You ever go onto AliExpress thinking you’re just casually browsing… and then suddenly you’ve fallen into this *rabbit hole* of deals that feel almost suspiciously low? Like, I can’t stop asking myself: how is it possible these things are **so sheep, so beyond cheap** that my brain wants to yell “this can’t be real” but my shopping hands keep clicking anyway?  

I ordered something the other day that cost less than a cup of gas station coffee, and it **actually arrived** looking better than what I expected. Am I the only one who feels like AliExpress has mastered some parallel economic universe we weren’t let in on?  

Here’s what I noticed:  

- Prices that feel accidentally wrong but are somehow intentional.  
- Delivery that takes time, yet feels magical when it shows up untouched by reality.  
- Random products that nobody asked for but are exactly what you didn’t know you needed.  

And every single time, it replays the same inner argument in my head:  
Is this a **smart life hack** or am I part of something larger—like the global consumer sheep herd, happily following low prices?  

The thrill of paying a price that almost laughs at capitalism is real.  
But the question underneath? Why do these items cost less than what I spend on coffee foam upgrades at Starbucks?  

Maybe it’s all strategy. Maybe it’s clever global supply chains at work.  
Or maybe it’s just us buyers hypnotized by the flashing discounts and 70% ""Hot Sale"" banners plastered across everything.  

But here’s the thing—sometimes I wonder if being one of the AliExpress sheep isn’t a bad thing. What if following the flock means finding little joys that cost almost nothing and arrive like surprise gifts to your doorstep?  

**Top On Sale Product Recommendations!** 🛒  

Ankle Fracture Fixation, Night Use, Daily Walking Brace, Foot Drop Fracture Fixation Support and Fixator  
Price Now: USD 48.79 (Original price: USD 57.40, 15% off)  
🔗Click & Buy: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7  

When it’s all said and done, here’s why people keep getting caught up in the AliExpress current:  

- Curiosity easily beats logic.  
- Low prices woo us, and they **always do**.  
- Who doesn’t love rolling the dice and landing on something unexpectedly useful?  

It’s confusing, it’s exhilarating, it’s cheap(er than cheap)—and I swear every purchase feels like a social experiment in how far our desire for bargains can stretch.  

At this point, am I shopping… or am I just grazing in a bigger, worldwide pasture, one low-price order at a time?  

Does anyone else feel this same mix of excitement and confusion every time they browse? Or am I literally part of the flock of AliExpress sheep, carrying a cart full of deals I don’t understand but also *cannot ignore*?",1,1757212138.0,Trendinfo,0,1.0,False

I consider myself an introspective writer and I love diving into my character's heads and focusing on their development. I lean towards masculine/nonbinary characters myself and enjoy queer pairings, but I genuinely care more about the chemistry between the characters! I also love exploring polyamorus dynamics, but I do not like any characters cheating. 

I'm also 33, so I'd prefer partners to be 25+, but 21+ is a requirement! 

I write in 3rd person, past tense over discord, and I tend to write several paragraphs! I don't have a length requirement, as long as there's effort put in and the story gets moved forward. I'm a very 'yes and' roleplayer, do I would love to be able to find someone who can help build the world with me as we go. 

**OC’s only** & I prefer more realistic faceclaims / descriptions, but I'm not too picky. I can happily write more than one 'main character' even if you only want to play one! I like plotting as we go to keep the story interesting! **If you really only want to play one MC, that's not a deal breaker, as long as you're still helping to carry the story!**

I do like including nsfw elements in the roleplay eventually, if the characters have chemistry & we have been writing together long enough to be comfortable with that. I do not want it to be instant or the focus of the rp! 

**Now, onto the fun stuff!!**

I am mostly interested in plotting out something in a modern / non fantasy setting but I could be talked into a medieval fantasy/d&d type setting!

General troupes I love are: getting off on the wrong foot, almost comically misunderstanding each other, forced proximity, enemies to friend to lovers, found family, realistic age gaps, single parents / exs / coparents. 

Random setting ideas: small towns, local coffee shops / bakeries, anything centered around a horse ranch or riding facility, anything centered around AA/NA

I do have some loose ideas for a former bully, super closeted blue collar guy, I am also a sucker for single parents and love to incorporate the chaos of kids into the story!

So I decided to finally sit down and actually ship something. After late nights and too much coffee, I built **Zink** \- a simple, generous alternative where you can shorten links and even create bio-style pages without paying crazy bills.

Right now it’s super barebones, but it works - you get 1 bio page + 15 links for free (with analytics too). I’m honestly just happy I finally built something end-to-end.

Last night I ended up passing out on the motel couch. I woke up maybe about an hour ago with a dry throat, a sharp headache, feeling nauseous. Which actually wasn’t so bad. Because at least it managed to draw focus away from everything else.

My immediate instinct was to head for the shower. But then I stopped before entering the bathroom.

I began arguing with myself in my head. What could really happen? The moment I turned the water on, she’d be right there behind me? It wasn’t possible.

But then again, none of this should’ve been possible.

I decided to text Brito about it. Not sure how I was expecting him to respond, or whether he was going to take it serious.

But he told me that he was heading over. To just stay put. And absolutely do not enter the shower.

While waiting around for him, I started wondering about the logistics of it all. I’d never entered my room and the woman had never got to me.

So what if I just never took a shower? Would I be alright?

At the very least, I should’ve been okay to use the sink. I splashed my face with cold water until the grogginess had become something manageable. Then I made myself some instant coffee and stared out the window, tried to dissociate.

Brito showed up a few minutes later. There were three others with him. One was a middle-aged man wearing a polo shirt, slacks. The other two were hulking SWAT officers outfitted in what looked like full sets of gear.

The officers stood quietly by the door while the man in the polo shirt flashed an FBI badge, introduced himself as Stephens. His expression was hard to read. He was smiling, but for what reason I couldn’t tell. It certainly wasn’t friendly but it also didn’t seem malicious.

Brito asked me if I had taken a shower yet. I told him that I hadn’t. He nodded.

Stephens then asked if he could look at both emails. I said sure and then gave him my phone. His expression stiffened for the five or so minutes he spent looking them over. But as he handed the phone back to me, the smile had returned.

He said it was very important that I co-operate with what he was about to tell me next.

I was going to take a shower while they monitored me. I’d shut the curtains but they’d be there in the room with me.

This was probably the only situation where I would’ve ever agreed to something like that. Even though I wasn’t fully convinced that anything would happen.

They told me that there shouldn’t have been anything to worry about, since they still had a visual of the woman in my apartment. Apparently she still hadn’t moved. And it was pretty clear that neither of them were really entertaining the possibility of her teleporting over. The prevailing theory was still that the woman had somehow found a way to enter my apartment without me noticing. How she did that, I couldn’t begin to fathom. But I suppose that in the absence of any other explanations, it had to be true. 

So I asked them what reason they had to want to monitor me. What were they expecting?

They told me that they weren’t entirely sure. But the situation was bizarre enough that it had forced the need to confirm certain truths. To test some theories.

Suddenly there came this gnawing feeling that it wasn’t worth the risk. After all, I could just take a bath.

But was I only going to take baths from now on? What was I actually afraid of? The woman was still in my apartment. I had armed SWAT guarding me. What the fuck could possibly happen?

There was no way in hell I was going to live paranoid, looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. I needed to confirm something as well. That I wasn’t in danger. That I had nothing to fear.

The plan was to have one of the officers stand out in the hallway by the front door while the other stationed himself right outside the bathroom.

Brito and Stephens both turned away as I stripped down, entered the shower. Doing so felt ridiculous enough that it managed to inject a bit of levity to the mood. But then I turned the water on and that disappeared almost immediately. Replaced by dread and uncertainty. It should’ve felt euphoric to scrub the dirt and sweat off of my skin. Instead my heart was beating heavy as I stared down at the drain.

I squeezed some shampoo into my hands and began massaging it into my scalp, though I continued to force my eyes open, keeping them on the drain.

But soon the stinging became too much and I closed them for just a few seconds as I wiped the shampoo away.

When I opened them back up, it looked like the water had taken on a brownish-green color.

At first I thought it could’ve been the shampoo. But then I could smell something rotten floating through the steam. Suddenly the spray plate from the showerhead dropped to the floor in front of me. The stench intensified.

It took me a few seconds too long to realize what was happening. I turned the water off and opened the curtains but before I could step out, I could feel something grab my hair. I tried yanking my head away but whatever was holding me had some kind iron grip. I couldn’t move. Both Brito and Stephens seemed frozen in place as they stared somewhere above me. Their eyes were wide and their mouths were slack. They looked shell-shocked.

I asked them to tell me what they were looking at cause I sure as hell didn’t want to turn around and find out for myself. But they didn’t tell me anything. Instead they yelled for the officer outside.

The bathroom door swung open but the officer stopped himself before entering. Though his mask was concealing his expression, his body language was telling enough. He shook his head, backed away. Then he ran out of the room.

I could feel whatever was holding my hair beginning to pull me up. As if it were trying to rip my scalp off.

Brito and Stephens continued to stand there, looking dumbfounded. I started to scream. But then the officer who had been out in the hallway rushed in. He also stopped at the doorway, hesitating for a moment before grabbing the knife from his belt and lunging towards me. Soon I could feel the pain and pressure alleviate. And the second I did, I leapt out of the tub.

Once I was out the bathroom, I turned around to see a pale arm retracting back into the showerhead.

It’s been a few hours since that happened. A chunk of my hair’s missing from where the officer had cut it off. My scalp’s been bandaged up and I ended up using the sink to scrub away whatever sewer water was left on my skin. Mentally I haven’t begun to recover at all.

I’m back at the police station now. I can feel everybody staring at me, though they all turn away whenever I try and look at them. A strange tension hangs in the air. Still no updates on Jackson. He might be out of the country by now. But they did give me an update on Elisa.

They can’t find her. She hasn’t been into work. Nobody’s seen her.

I know it’s my fault. I could’ve warned her. But would she have believed me? Would it have been too late anyways? How the fuck could I have seen this coming?

I've also learned that the woman is no longer in my apartment. From what I've heard, she disappeared right in front of the cops who had been watching her. They just blinked and she was gone. They think she's still in the motel. Somewhere in the pipes.

I’ve deleted all my emails. Every single address. The cops insisted I do so and I didn’t fight them on it.

But then I received a text message. From a number I didn’t recognize.

I should’ve paid more attention, been more careful. I shouldn’t have opened it. But I did.

1nahhpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1nahhpz/anyone_else_have_a_toxic_friend_during_pregnancy/,Anyone else have a toxic friend during pregnancy? I want to hear your stories.,"Hello :) I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with a friend like this during pregnancy? I’ve known her since school, and even though we live on opposite sides of the country, we talk daily and only see each other a couple of times a year. The last time me and my partner traveled down to see her (about a year ago), she ditched us after an hour to hang out with a guy she’d just met. My other friend told me she’s done the same thing to him too. Honestly, our online friendship is much better than hanging out in real life.


When I first found out I was pregnant (around 4 weeks), I reached out to her for advice since she’s a nurse. But instead of being supportive, she told me I wasn’t actually pregnant and that it was all in my head. She even said my periods had stopped because I was stressed from watching the news. I thought that was such a weird response. I sent her pictures of two different positive pregnancy tests, and instead of saying congratulations, she just told me not to get excited and kept pointing out everything that could go wrong.


Now I’m in my second trimester with two great scans, but she’s still saying the same negative things. Just yesterday she told me not to announce my pregnancy “in case something happens.” A lot of her advice has been really bizarre too. For example, she told me to sip alcohol for nausea, that my partner should keep taking me to Starbucks and get the biggest coffee possible, and when I was feeling poorly, not to ask my midwife but to just go to the pharmacy and get strong medicine. She insists “she knows this stuff” because she’s a healthcare worker, but honestly it makes me uneasy.


My partner feels like she’s almost trying to sabotage the pregnancy. She’s also been making comments about him, saying I should leave because he hasn’t given me enough commitment—even though we live together, are having a baby, and he takes such good care of me. Lately, she’s been sending me Instagram travel videos saying, “If you weren’t pregnant, we could be doing this,” which feels especially odd since she’s not adventurous at all and usually avoids leaving the house.


I might be overthinking it, but I honestly don’t know if it would be safe to let her meet the baby. The strange part is, she’s actually moved forward in her own life—she met someone less than a year ago, they’re engaged, and they’re even talking about kids.

Is anyone else having a similar situation? ",2,1757211371.0,PregnancyUK,5,1.0,False

I have a Timemore 078 in White in great working condition. Minimal wear and tear, no modifications, clean and only used in home for a couple months.

Wanting an Ode with Brew (Unimodal V1) burrs to replace it. I am open to MP (Red Speed only) but I will hold out a bit for Brew burrs.

Ode Gen 1 or Gen 2 not important, but I would prefer a newer gen 1 in excellent condition.

I am asking for a trading value of $600 (willing to listen to buyers, but lowest priority at this time). Will ship or meet locally in Northern VA.

Thank you!
