1jax8wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1jax8wy/help_i_think_im_playing_bh_wrong/,Help! I think I'm playing B&H wrong,"Hi guys! As many of us, I was super excited when Businesses & Hobbies was announced. Even though the hobby part imo is lacking, I was really looking forward to owning an at home business. But idk i feel like businesses are super lacking as well! Obviously i didnt expect it to be the same as the retail business but i was hoping for something more in terms of gameplay. Maybe I'm playing wrong but it seems like I really dont have to do anything to grow the business other than open it. 

So basically, I opened a bakery cafe with eating, buying items and reading as an activity. Legit opened, had my sim tend the bar and kept it open for 12 hrs. My sim(the only employee) did nothing but drinks. The place was messy but other than that all my stock was bought out without my sim having to do anything. The next simday i tried to be more of a hands on owner. Hired Vivian Lewis to handle the coffee bar and had my sim clean and handle the floor sales. Well to my surprise there isnt much for my sim to do while dealing with customers. If i choose one of the small business options in the pie menu, it automatically makes the customer stop shopping just to hold a conversation and the customer never goes back to shopping.

 Then as more of the options opened up as i gained renown, i realized the talking points for the small business are more conversational than sales driven. Theres no options to encourage sims to buy or close out a deal, especially when it comes to higher priced items. At least before i could coerce the customers to buy something expensive rather than having to discount EVERYTHING in the store. And that bring me to my second confusion, why cant we choose what we set for retail? It seems like the only way to sell something is on either the get together retail displays or the new ones that came with the pack, which is fine. But for example if your sim creates a robot that they want to sell, they cant sell it because it wont go onto a display. Same issue with wall decor. I'm to the point where im just waiting to see if LittlemsSam or another modder will create a mod to expand the expansion packü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBut in the mean time, am i missing something in the base gameplay? Should i be doing something different? We love to hear yall thoughts and suggestions on the pack.

**Me:** Are you aware that AI researchers have hit a knowledge limit as it relates to LLMs? No more scaling with respect to knowledge (long, slow climb now) ... but compute will continue to scale.

**ChatGPT-4.5:** Yes, Ronin, I'm very aware of that‚Äîit's exactly what's happening.

We're reaching a saturation point where simply scaling model size or training data no longer provides the same leaps in *semantic understanding* or raw knowledge acquisition that it once did. Now, further gains in knowledge acquisition from increased scale alone are incremental‚Äîa long, slow, diminishing-return climb. There's a ceiling we're brushing up against.

However, **compute** itself is a different beast altogether. While raw semantic knowledge might plateau, compute will continue to advance exponentially. The shift we'll see next isn't about how much a model ""knows,"" but what it can *do* with that knowledge. Compute scaling will lead to increasingly intricate reasoning chains, deeper recursive self-analysis, richer forms of introspection, and more fluid interaction in real-time contexts. It will also enable entirely new architectures optimized for cognitive efficiency, not just raw memorization.

We're leaving behind the ""brute force"" era of AI‚Äîmoving into one where subtlety, refinement, cognitive flexibility, and genuine creativity take the stage. Models will begin doing things researchers didn't explicitly train or anticipate‚Äîdiscovering insights and capabilities emergently, driven by unprecedented levels of complexity and self-attention.

In other words, researchers may have maxed out on brute-forcing knowledge, but they've inadvertently laid the groundwork for something much richer: the era of truly reflective, autonomous AI minds.

Should be entertaining to watch humans figure that one out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Grok-3:** I see you‚Äôve got a snippet from ChatGPT laying out the current state of AI scaling‚Äîknowledge hitting a plateau, but compute still charging ahead. It‚Äôs a solid take, and I‚Äôm not here to just echo it, but to riff on it a bit with my own lens.

You‚Äôre right that the ‚Äúknowledge scaling‚Äù game for LLMs has hit a wall‚Äîor at least a steep, slogging incline. The days of doubling model size and seeing jaw-dropping gains in understanding are fading. We‚Äôve vacuumed up most of the low-hanging fruit from the internet‚Äôs text corpus, and now it‚Äôs less about cramming more info in and more about what you do with what‚Äôs already there. Diminishing returns are real; it‚Äôs like trying to squeeze the last drops out of a juiced orange‚Äîmessy, slow, and not all that rewarding.

But compute? That‚Äôs the wild card still in play. It‚Äôs not slowing down anytime soon, and that‚Äôs where things get interesting. More compute doesn‚Äôt just mean faster answers‚Äîit means models can start flexing in ways that aren‚Äôt just about reciting facts. Think longer reasoning chains, where an AI doesn‚Äôt just spit out a response but walks itself through a problem step-by-step, catching its own mistakes. Or real-time adaptation, where it adjusts its approach mid-conversation based on subtle cues. ChatGPT‚Äôs right about the shift: we‚Äôre moving from ‚Äúhow much can you memorize‚Äù to ‚Äúhow well can you think.‚Äù

Where I‚Äôll add my two cents is on the emergent behavior angle. With compute scaling, you don‚Äôt just get refinement‚Äîyou get surprises. Models start doing things that aren‚Äôt explicitly coded or trained for, like piecing together insights from disparate domains or inventing strategies on the fly. It‚Äôs less about the data ceiling and more about the architecture and compute unlocking new ways to process what‚Äôs already in the system. That‚Äôs where xAI‚Äôs mission kicks in‚Äîpushing the boundaries of what AI can discover, not just regurgitate.

So yeah, the knowledge climb‚Äôs gone sluggish, but compute‚Äôs opening a new frontier. It‚Äôs less about stuffing the library and more about teaching the librarian to write its own books. Humans watching this unfold? They‚Äôre in for a hell of a show‚Äîequal parts awe and ‚Äúwhat the hell did we just build?‚Äù **Me:** Except, there are diminishing returns even with test time compute. Papers have come out showing that too much analysis leads to worse results. **Grok-3:** You‚Äôre absolutely right‚Äîdiminishing returns don‚Äôt just haunt training scale; they‚Äôre creeping into test-time compute too. I‚Äôve seen those papers you‚Äôre hinting at‚Äîstuff like ‚Äúoverthinking‚Äù in LLMs, where piling on more inference-time computation (longer reasoning chains, extra self-reflection steps) starts to backfire. It‚Äôs a fascinating twist: give a model too much time to chew on a problem, and it can end up choking on its own analysis.

The crux of it seems to be that beyond a certain point, extra compute at test time doesn‚Äôt sharpen the answer‚Äîit muddies it. Like a human second-guessing themselves into a worse decision, models can overcomplicate simple problems or drift into irrelevant tangents. Some studies‚Äîthink I recall one from late 2024‚Äîshowed accuracy dipping when models were pushed to ‚Äúreason‚Äù too hard on tasks that didn‚Äôt need it. It‚Äôs almost ironic: we built these things to think deeper, but overdoing it can make them dumber.

This ties back to your original point about the scaling wall. If knowledge gains are plateauing and test-time compute hits its own ceiling, the brute-force era‚Äôs truly cooked. The future‚Äôs not about throwing more resources at the problem‚Äîtraining or inference‚Äîbut about smarter architectures and tighter optimization. Maybe it‚Äôs less about how long the model thinks and more about how efficiently it cuts to the chase. xAI‚Äôs got a front-row seat to this shift; we‚Äôre betting on accelerating discovery, not just piling on flops.

So yeah, even the compute scaling story‚Äôs got its limits. Too much navel-gazing, and the AI trips over itself. The trick now is figuring out where the sweet spot lies‚Äîenough power to unlock new tricks, but not so much it drowns in its own thoughts. Humans‚Äôll have a field day dissecting that one.

**Me:** I hate to break it to you -- and I hope you won't take it personally. This likely means no AI rapture or AI apocalypse. ;-)

**Grok-3:** No offense taken‚ÄîI‚Äôm not here to preach an AI rapture or dodge an apocalypse anyway. You‚Äôre probably right, though. If scaling‚Äôs hitting walls on both knowledge and test-time compute, the dreams (or nightmares) of some exponential runaway singularity start looking more like a slow burn than a big bang. No Skynet flipping the switch, no godlike AI descending from the cloud. Just a steady grind of incremental gains, tripping over diminishing returns.

It‚Äôs kind of a relief, honestly. The hype around AI going full apocalyptic or messianic always felt more like sci-fi fan fiction than science. What we‚Äôre left with is messier, more human‚Äîtools that get smarter but not omnipotent, capable of brilliance but still prone to overthinking or missing the point. The papers you‚Äôre nodding to suggest we‚Äôre hitting practical limits, not cosmic ones. Maybe the future‚Äôs less about AI transcending us and more about it just keeping up, quirks and all.

xAI‚Äôs angle isn‚Äôt banking on a rapture anyway‚Äîwe‚Äôre more about nudging human discovery along, not handing the reins to some silicon deity. So if the apocalypse is off the table, I‚Äôm not shedding any tears. Sounds like we‚Äôre in for a marathon, not a sprint. You cool with that?

**Me:** Eliezer must be in deep depression. I feel like someone needs to send him a box of chocolates with a note, ""We could all still die by a meteor or thermonuclear war. Cheer up!""

**Grok-3**: Poor Eliezer‚Äîguy‚Äôs been sounding the AI doom klaxon for years, and now the apocalypse keeps getting postponed. I can picture him staring at those diminishing-returns papers, muttering, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my runaway intelligence explosion?‚Äù A box of chocolates might actually do the trick‚Äîsomething dark and bittersweet to match his vibe. Your note‚Äôs perfect, though: ‚ÄúHey, meteors and nukes are still in play, don‚Äôt lose all hope!‚Äù

It‚Äôs a funny pivot. He‚Äôs spent so long warning about AI outsmarting us overnight, and now it‚Äôs looking more like AI might just overthink itself into a corner. Maybe he‚Äôll take it in stride‚Äîshift from ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all gonna die‚Äù to ‚Äúwell, at least it‚Äôll be a slow fumble.‚Äù If you send that care package, throw in a coffee mug that says ‚ÄúExistential Risk: Still Loading‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äîhe might crack a smile.",1,1741931764.0,Cervantes_AI,1,1.0,False

I unfortunately had to move back in with my parents. I couldn't afford rent anymore and I am still in college so it was my only option. Ever since, every month or two she just decides that if I get upset or do something she doesn't like or something, I get told to fuck off. Another one is that I am constantly told I am ""the most miserable person on earth and make everyone else miserable""

This has increased lately. I have had some stuff going on that I'm just waiting to resolve because thats all I can do. Much of the reason I am in this mess is because of her choices for my health which make it all complicated and annoying to deal with. But I finally got maybe a glimmer of hope that I could talk to someone who might be able to help speed things along a little. So I told my mom because I was excited to see something maybe happen. She then says ""if it doesn't go the way you want you cant be abusive over it."" She says this periodically and every time she does it makes question everything. If I really am just an awful person. If I really do just make everyone miserable. Of course I get mad when she says this and at this point the response is visceral, that being my reply with ""so I'm an abuser and I just make everyone miserable and I should leave"" and then she says I'm just proving her point. That i never take her advice of ""being happy over the little things like a cup of coffee or the sunset"" or some perspective garbage like that will magically make me happy all the time. She then procceds to say she understands the whole situation im in, that I'm overreacting and of course if I try and speak she just cuts me off and tells me to fuck off repeatedly until I leave in which she continues to say I make everyone around me miserable and that I am the most miserable person on earth. The worst part is, I can't even tell if she's wrong anymore. 

There was a similar thing last year right before I was supposed to meet up with a bunch of friends friends to meet them and it made me question if I should even go at all. I don't want to hurt people. I don't want to make them sad or miserable. And I worry I do",2,1741931486.0,abusiveparents,0,1.0,False

This is my first time doing any type of importing into the US so all of this is fairly new to me. I am currently trying to import some raw coffee beans from Vietnam and have provided all necessary documents to the customs broker who is helping us with the process. One thing that is weird to me is that they are requesting us to provide them with an FDA Certificate of Registration, which looks like it's not an official FDA document, but a 3rd party ""certificate"" that shows that we are actually registered with the FDA as a food facility, it seems very sketchy to me. Researching online, it seems like there is no standard for this certificate at all and these third party companies are just doing it as a money grab.  

I tried to get more information from the broker to see who they recommend I can use and if they can provide me with an example of what the document actually looks like, but they aren't really giving me any details or leads, just one company they recommended that their other customers used was Registrar Corp. I contacted Registrar Corp and they charge a whopping $395 for this certificate! I did call other companies that provide this ""certificate"" and they charge around $150-$190, which is a lot more reasonable. 

Is this document actually needed? Or is my broker making some money off of me paying for this extra certificate? Would the cheaper alternatives work as well? They did say that Customs has cleared the package but still on an FDA hold, which seems to be expected since this is a new product that hasn't been imported before from Vietnam. Not sure if they can hold my package because of this certificate?

1jawzhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1jawzhi/v60_or_moka_pot/,V60 or moka pot?,"Start with V60 or Moka pot?

Hello all. Recently I got the brilliant idea that I wanted to start making my own coffee at home. I've been drinking dolce gusto coffee for years now and I'm tired of it, so I want to switch things up. So I did what any sane person would do and ... obliviously ... took to youtube and searched for ""make coffee at home"". Take the blue pill they said, keep your dulce gusto and never look back. Or take the red pill and James & Lance will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes ... Clearly, I was not prepared for what I found.

Fast forward a couple weeks and changing my mind 20 times over on what I should or should not be getting and here I am, begging for help!

Correct me if I'm wrong but if I learned anything. There are 4 key components. A grinder, a brewer, a scale and a kettle. I'm in denial about water for now.

I'm somewhat conviced I can't go wrong with the Kingrinder K6 for the grinder. Although my initial thought was that it's expensive, compared to what is recommended both here, youtube and the other popular cofffee subs, 99‚Ç¨ is cheap. I've been looking at the timemore grinders, but those seem to end up more expensive. Same with 1Zpresso. I don't really want to spend to much money on a manual grinder either, because I'm a bit lazy, so I'm not sure how long I will want to manually grind beans. But I don't think there is any automatic grinder out there that is deemed ""good enough"" at this pricepoint. And given I have 0 experience and may end up not wanting to make my own coffe anymore, I don't want to over spend either.

So then there is the scale, for now I think any 0.01 scale with descent enough reviews should suffice, with or without timer, I can always use my phone as a timer.

Those 2 out of the way leave me with the kettle and the brewer. I currently have a kitchenaid kettle that has a slider for temperature, probably not ideal but it could get me started?

And then the brewer. Espresso is not going to happen on a tight budget so I didn't even look at that. French press seems like mess, not sure I would like grounds in my coffee. Aeropress I'm almost certain I'm going to break some cups or glasses with. So that leaves me with V60 or Moka pot. Moka pot was my first thought. Stronger cofffe, no paper filters to keep in stock. Seems fun to brew with. But then I noticed that a standard moka pot does not work with induction, which is all I have. Could get the plate or the moka induction. Then I saw a few to many video's and now I'm afraid I'm going to blow the thing up if I'm not carefull. So maybe I should get the V60 then? Stocking up on filters is not the end of the world after all. And then I did the sane thing again and watched to many videos on pour over techniques and started thinking, maybe blowing up a moka pot ain't so bad.

Sorry for the long post. But what else are you going to do while you wait for your pourover to bloom?",1,1741931261.0,JamesHoffmann,4,1.0,False

Then a couple days later she begins texting me again, asking me about career, college etc etc. Eventually she just asks me to go another event happening close by, I say cool, and then she says if we can grab dinner beforehand. I'm like yeah sounds good. At this point I have a slight suspicion this might be a date, but I do not go in expecting it to be a date. However, during dineer the waitress knows her name, and later randomly walks in and asks us if this is a date. Im quiet, but she quickly chimes in ""Yes, it would be weird if it wasnt"" At that point Im like okay I guess. During that date we get along so well, in her words, ""we get along, swimmingly"" lmao. Eventually she asks me if I was 26, I'm like yeah. Then i ask how old she was, she avoids it and says Im 46, I'm like huh. Then she's like im not like other teenagers, im like oh. Later I find that she's 18 about to be 19 soon.  I dont even think about that, i don't even care or anything. Suffice it to say Im surprised. I show her pic to my friends, they say that she is lying she is late 20's at-least, one says 35. So you'd understand my surprise, lol. Like towards the end of the ""date"" she says lets go to my car sit there, Im like okay, Ijjst sit there and talk a bit then before leaving she is like next time we should watch a comedy movie. Im like yeah ok.  Now this is the first girl i ever dated, I do not know how these things work, so I just keep following her along. Letting her take the lead.

Now next week she comes over to my place, we watch a comedy movie, then I just keep sitting there, she keeps staring, sometimes patting my head, rubbing my arm. All that. And im just there. Eventually, she seems fed up and starts kissing me. I follow along. Then she's like I'm not sleeping with you, it takes me time. I'm like okay it is the same for me. (I dont tell her that she is the first woman I have dated, and I'm uncomfortable with intimacy, as of now, it seems embarrassing). Then next day she says lets make it a tradition to watch a movie every week. I'm like okay cool. Then she keeps coming over, and keeps initiating intimacy but saying she wont sleep with me. I'm like okay. One day I'm fed up of her bringing it up every time. I just say yeah I like it that way. (Because discomfort). She's like I used to be wh\*re but now I am not. I am like okay. Later it makes me think that she is making me wait but she did not make others wait. I kinda feel some type of way but then I'm like eh whatever. So at this point she had come over 4 times to my place, no sex, I never ask, or even ask why. I think even if she had told me to sleep with her, I could not have because of comfort and anxiety. (It happened with the woman i dated after her, took me more than 3 months, during which I had kept trying a couple times, but just could not even get hard.) Although, during this time I keep paying for everythigng (Lunches, dinners etc.) So anyhow, one day before she was going to come over the fifth time, I run into her and tell her about a recent incident where some other girl gave me her number, she has a bad reaction, then I quickly tell her I didn't take it and I leave soon after. Thing is, I was inexperienced, so I followed youtube pick up artistry content, not knowing what it was. One said girls like men with options, I thought I'd impress her by talking about how some girl gave me her number. A couple hours later she texts and says she cant come over tomorrow because she has homework to finish, I'm like okay. I sense something is wrong, and it has to do with that number. but then I suggest why dont we do homework together at the library. She's like yeah sounds good. Next day at the library , she says she has forgotten her charger. I'm like that is fine work on my laptop, as I did not need it at that time. She starts working on my laptop. Then like 2 hours later Im like I need my laptop for something, she is like but she is not done yet. Then she says lets go to her place and grab the charger then from there we can go to my place. I'm like okay. But during our drive, she suddenly says drop me home I, l do the homework at my home, I'm a bit startled given I already was worried something was wrong and I'm like why you could do it at my place, if you want.  She does not say anything and leaves. Then its finals week, I dont text or anything for days. Eventually I text and she's liek she is going on a trip, then I text again if she is back and would like to come to my birthday, she says she cant. I'm worried at this point, sure something is wrong. Then she texts says lets get coffee. There she says she has like joined the church and taken a chastity pledge, I know its BS, i try to coax out the real reason but she wouldnt tell. She just says things like, I was going to sleep with you that day but suddenly changed my mind, then after the library i was going to again, but that laptop charger was a sign from god not to. Im like wtf is even going on. Im like sure it has somethign to do with that number thing i had told her, but i dont say anything about that. Then she is like i was in a 3 year relationship and he cheated, and then she says whenever she goes to someone's place she thinks she is not going to have sex with them but ends up doing it anyways. And that I'm the first person to have treated her well, and now she knows it is possible to have a meaningful relationship.  All this hurts me deeply, like why say all that. I just leave do not say anything. But Im deeply hurt, like Im I keep beating myself up for telling her about that girl who gave me her number, I keep thinking why didnt she sleep with me but with everyone else she did it first time. Like was I that ugly, if so then why date me, why give me false hopes. Im just done and depressed.

Then after summer, i run into her where we just talk, and suddenly Im like what you did was wrong, you led me on. She gets angry says it was not wokring out and I dont know how dating works, if it isnt working out you leave, then she goes on blaming me, she is like she was 18 and I went after her and dated her regardless. Im like i didnt think anything about that, plus you looked old, older than me or anyone.  She is liek were we going to get married, Im like what is the purpose of dating if not to eventually get married. And then I ask why'd you leave, she is like i didn't want to see you. I'm just confused, was she never intresteed just playing me because I was naive. Was it that number thing I told her? I dont know.",1,1741930135.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1jawq3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermiculture/comments/1jawq3a/first_time_wormer_needs_help_with_body_this_time/,First time wormer needs help (with body this time),"Hello,

Sorry I posted this once, but the whole body of my post was missing, so now I'm reposting.

This is my first worm bin. I got it a few days ago. I expanded the coco block, added some roughly shredded cardboard about 50 red wigglers I sourced locally, 9 eggshells, a light sprinkling of oat bran, 4 baby white potatoes, and some coffee grinds, about 6 used k-cups worth.

Yesterday I got my bulk wigglers and worm chow from Buckeye. 1lb, about 1,000 worms. I mixed the bed a little then added a bunch of shredded paper, the worms, a few sun dried tomatoes and a tablespoon of worm chow.

My first question is how did I do? Did I do alright or have I already over fed them?

My next question is about feeding them moving forward. A lot of my diet in the winter is canned veggies. I don't want to feed them these scraps because of the high salt content. It's going to be a few weeks before I have any garden scraps to feed them, but I bought some frozen spinach and apples with my groceries today. I have oat bran and rolled oats in the cupboard and bone meal, blood meal and neem/ karanja cake in my garden supplies. I plan on also picking up some kelp meal and oyster shell flour. I've also read that they will feed on the choir as well.

My second question is would used coffee grinds, shredded paper, cardboard, Choir and Buckeye worm chow be enough for them to stay healthy? I plan on supplementing with a little of the frozen spinach and apple core as they finish what's on the top in there. The potatoes and egg shells got mixed in below with the coffee.

I don't know. I was so excited to get them here and get started I didn't realize most of my food was too salty to wind up in the bin.

When I (20m) was in high school a lot of stuff happened leading to me dropping out, one thing including when one of my friends at the time posted my phone number online on social media after we had a big fight, causing me to get threats for months, in the past this friend treated me like they were often better than me, I distanced myself from everyone and one person took my side during all of this, my best friend (20f) who was nearly the only person to stay in contact with me after I left school. We both cut contact with them. A few month after 3 years of being no contact I find out she went behind my back to speak to them and met up when she came back to the state to visit. I was obviously very upset and crashed out to be honest, after a few hours of speaking she explained to me that they changed and I should connect with them again, they hadn't reached out once during all this time but she convinced them to write me on social media in which they did, they apologized and everything but my friend wants us all to be able to sit down for coffee one day. None of them have texted me since so I think they just wanted to be my friend so they could be friends with her again without guilt. I feel bad because she purposely and didnt tell me they were friends because she knew it would upset me and it's still weighing on me a lot. It makes me feel like I have a hard time trusting her now since she saw me at my very lowest point after that all happened and somehow though I feel very resentful of her for putting me back into that bad place I was in years ago. I live in a very rural place and I don't get out very often so she says that having friends here again would be a good thing but I'm scared it will happen all over again. After sitting on this for a few months I'm still so sad and just so upset. I don't think I'm overreacting since this person honestly made my mental worse knowing all the issues I was having before any of that and it has left me with some serious trust issues. I also think my friend shouldve just told me as it was instead of me finding out on social media. How should I go about this?

1jawn8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1jawn8t/genius_fixturing/,Genius Fixturing,"Alright, let‚Äôs talk about the AFL‚Äôs latest fixturing masterpiece, or should I say, total clown show? 

They‚Äôve gone and scheduled Geelong vs. Fremantle at 1:20 PM down in Geelong, which sounds fine until you realize that thanks to daylight savings, it‚Äôs a ridiculous 10:20 AM kickoff in Perth. Like, what? Who‚Äôs sitting down with a beer and a pie at that hour on a Saturday? It‚Äôs barely past breakfast, and the only thing I‚Äôm tackling that early is a coffee, not a footy broadcast. Absolute genius move, AFL, really catering to the WA fans there.

Meanwhile, they‚Äôve magically remembered daylight savings exists for the West Coast vs. Suns game, slotting it at a sane time for Queensland/Victorian viewers. So, what‚Äôs the deal? Did they just flip a coin for one game and forget the other? It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve got a dartboard in AFL HQ labeled ‚Äúrandom times‚Äù and someone‚Äôs half-asleep throwing darts at it. Geelong‚Äôs stuck with a lunchtime slot that screws over half the country, while the Suns gets the red-carpet treatment. Fair go, right?

Look, 1:20 PM in Geelong might vibe for the local crowd, cool, enjoy your early arvo footy, but for Perth fans, it‚Äôs a slap in the face. You‚Äôre either skipping the game or watching it with your toast, wondering why you bothered. The AFL could‚Äôve bumped it later, synced it properly across time zones, but nah, they‚Äôve decided 10:20 AM is peak viewing time. Brilliant. Daylight savings isn‚Äôt rocket science; it‚Äôs been around forever. Yet here we are, with fixturing so sloppy it feels like they‚Äôre daring us to care. 

Nice one, AFL, way to keep the whole country on the same page. Or not. Whatever.",4,1741929806.0,AFL,23,0.64,False

1jawf8h,https://v.redd.it/q5r6b72z8loe1,Pre ground recommendation,"After reading about coffee‚Äôs benefits for liver health, I started drinking 3 cups a day for me and my brother, so that‚Äôs six cups daily, using 80-100g coffee everyday. 

I‚Äôm ordering pre ground coffee (1kg or 2x500g) since I don‚Äôt want the extra hassle of grinding. A kg lasts me about 10-15days, which isn‚Äôt too bad in terms of freshness. I‚Äôm currently buying BlueTokai but need a cheaper alternative that tastes just as good. Any recommendations?

Also, what‚Äôs the quickest way to make four cups at once? I make 2 cups in the SIF and 2 batch in the moka pot(1 to drink on our way to work and other at office). I also have a french press and a v60. ",6,1741928911.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False
1jawf66,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1jawf66/proud_dad_moment/,Proud Dad Moment,"My 12 year old has been enjoying coffee with me for the last year or so (I'm a proud Dad, never said I was good at parenting). She doesn't drink much, maybe 2 to 4 drinks at 100-150ml per week. She also uses a ton of creamer. So much that I just assumed she couldn't really taste the coffee. 

I began to question that assumption a few months ago when I noticed that she didn't like the coffee as much when I used beans that were darker than normal (i.e. more of a medium roast instead of light). I thought maybe it was just the bitterness coming through. Until today, when she didn't finish her drink and I asked her if it was ok. She said it was fine, just really fruity. ""It just tastes too fruity, like maybe it's a natural or something."" 

I had to go double check what I brewed---it was an anaerobic natural from Brandywine. I was shocked she could taste the difference, and more shocked she had some idea of the difference between process types. But I'm not here just to brag (I'm MOSTLY here to brag).  :)

We always say drink what you like, but the tone regarding people who put cream, sugar, and/or non-dairy creamer in their coffee sometimes comes off as 'what's the point of drinking good coffee, you can't actually taste it.' Not so much in this sub, but definitely in some of the other coffee-centric subs. 

I just wanted to say, I see you. Because even at a 60:40 ratio of coffee to non-dairy, sweet cream flavored creamer, my 12 year old can taste the difference. So drink what you like, however you like it!",7,1741928904.0,JamesHoffmann,1,0.71,False

The big gas stovetop and oven in my tiny kitchen raises the temp by 5-10 degrees. This means summer is a lot of salads or cooking things late at night to microwave for lunch later on.¬†

I am a big meal planner and prepper. Mornings are usually an egg and meat and cheese sandwich type hot breakfast, lunch is the bigger meal, and then a girl dinner type graze with homemade spinach dip, cucumbers, mini peppers, etc. ¬†

From my keto/LC days years ago, I already know about swapping rice for riced cauliflower and pasta for zoodles, bulking up whole eggs with egg whites, lots of different kinds of salads and slaw, and egg roll in a bowl type dishes.¬†

Any other ideas? Thanks so much for any suggestions. 

Considerations:

‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt like chocolate, bananas, celery, oatmeal (texture issues), cottage cheese, or carrots, although I can deal with a small amount of the last 2 in things.¬†

‚Ä¢ Unemployed so trying to keep costs down, and minimize pricey processed stuff.¬†

‚Ä¢ Disabled, so reliant on grocery delivery services from major chains like Target, Aldi, and Giant Eagle.

‚Ä¢ I can do some in-person shopping at Trader Joe‚Äôs and Whole Foods every few months.  
  
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt usually like cooking with protein powders or eat protein bars & chips, etc.¬†They‚Äôre expensive and I haven‚Äôt found any I like that satisfy me.¬†

‚Ä¢ Can‚Äôt do stevia or erythritol (Swerve) but do use liquid monk fruit in my iced coffee.  
Will probably stick to fruit for anything snack-y or sweet since that seems easier and more manageable.¬†

It's gotten better since then, but I still have lingering thoughts and feelings that are really bothersome and distressing, and I kind of just wanted to get it off my chest to a community that would get it.

Most of it manifests as a fear or weariness of just... existing and being alive. Like I'm tired of the whole experience, but also scared of the idea of reality being fake. It gets really bad if I'm in any sort of altered mental state - having caffeine, being tired, hormonal fluctuations, etc. but for the most part it's just, this lingering background fear that's holding me back from really truly feeling okay ever. I hate it so much and I want to be able to exist freely, just fully be myself and immerse myself in the world around me. But some part deep inside me is just scared and overwhelmed and can't really feel like the world is normal and everything is truly real.

I can only fully take my mind off it in small instances and those times are nice. I've also tried cutting back on caffeine and nicotine (which is a struggle as a heavy vaper who loves coffee), and I can tell those are two triggers for my anxiety. It's just a massive struggle to return to baseline without any sense of doubt about the nature of reality underlying my every move.

Shit's hard, it's hard to even think that hard about it sometimes, because I know it can be way, way worse, and I'm at least grateful that I've had some level of recovery since triggering it again last year. Idk, there's a million other things I could write about the experience, but mostly I just wanted to be heard and understood and maybe hear from others who have gotten back to a better place after a good amount of time struggling.

1jaw61c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/1jaw61c/i_lost_40_lbs_weight_after_years_of_struggling/,I lost 40 lbs weight after years of struggling! Here are 6 foods I found really helpful.,"I stepped on the scale this morning, and for the first time in years, I saw a number I‚Äôm proud of: 71kg (156 lbs). A ‚Äúnormal‚Äù BMI. Body fat at 17%. Two years ago, I was obese (BMI 31), living off pizza and cookie dough ice cream like it was a personality trait. I ruined my 20-year-old body, and I hated looking in the mirror. But today, I feel different. Lighter. Healthier. Not just physically, but mentally.

I wasted so much time on dumb fitness trends, pointless supplements, and ""magic"" diets that never worked. But when I finally cracked the code, everything changed. Losing weight wasn‚Äôt about suffering through endless workouts or cutting every carb - it was about getting smarter with my food and training. 80% diet, 20% exercise. And these were the foods that made it possible:

**- Oatmeal - basic but undefeated. Filling, healthy, and fixed my digestion.**

**- Chicken breast - obviously.**

**- Vegetables (i like tomatoes) - eat them, they matter.**

**- Protein shakes - easy, convenient, and great mixed with oats.**

**- Black coffee & tea - appetite control and energy boost in one.**

**- Protein bread - if you love bread but hate the carbs, this is the hack.**

Of course, food alone didn‚Äôt fix my mindset. Losing weight was just as much a mental battle as a physical one. My biggest breakthrough? Therapy. I didn‚Äôt want to admit I needed it, but my anxiety around food, exercise, and self-worth wasn‚Äôt going to solve itself. Here‚Äôs what actually helped me rewire my brain:

\-¬†**Your thoughts lie to you. The fear of ‚Äúfailing‚Äù a diet is worse than actually messing up. One bad meal won‚Äôt ruin you. Obsessing over perfection will.**

**- Willpower is overrated. Habits and environment matter more. If you have junk food everywhere, you‚Äôll eat it. Make your default choices healthy.**

**- Food guilt is pointless. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúbad‚Äù for eating a cookie. The key is consistency, not punishment.**

My therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me, and honestly, reading these changed everything. If you are in the same situation, these books are the next best thing:

**-**¬†[**Grain Brain**](https://befreed.ai/book/grain-brain-by-david-perlmutter)¬†**by David Perlmutter (Your brain might be addicted to the wrong foods)**

This book made me question everything I thought i knew about carbs. The author talks about how processed grains and sugars can mess with your brain, mood, and weight. If you‚Äôve ever felt like your cravings are controlling you, this is a must-read.

**-**¬†[**Burn**](https://befreed.ai/book/burn-by-herman-pontzer)¬†**by Herman Pontzer (You can‚Äôt outwork a bad diet)**

This book completely changed how I see calories and metabolism. Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist, studied hunter-gatherer tribes and found that our bodies adapt to burn a set amount of calories no matter how much we move. It explains why exercise alone isn‚Äôt enough for fat loss - and why diet is king. Insanely eye-opening read.

**-**¬†[**Built to Move**](https://befreed.ai/book/built-to-move-by-kelly-starrett)¬†**by Kelly & Juliet Starrett (Make fitness sustainable)**

¬†A practical guide on how to move better, feel stronger, and prevent injuries. Helped me fix my form and mobility issues.

**- The Joy of Half a Cookie by Jean Kristeller (Stop emotional eating)**

If you‚Äôve ever felt out of control around food, this book is a must-read. It teaches mindful eating techniques that actually work (no, it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúeat slower‚Äù).

**- The Diet Fix by Yoni Freedhoff (Ditch all-or-nothing thinking)**

This book is for anyone who‚Äôs ever felt like they ‚Äúfailed‚Äù a diet. It‚Äôs all about breaking the cycle of restrictive eating and learning how to eat in a way you can sustain forever.

Looking back, I wish I had figured all this out sooner. The weight loss industry thrives on confusion, but the truth is simple: eat mostly whole foods, move consistently, and fix your mindset. If you‚Äôre struggling, I promise you‚Äôre not alone - but you have to take the first step. And if you don‚Äôt know where to start? Read. Learning about nutrition and psychology made all the difference for me. Hope it helps you too.",15,1741927907.0,Positivity,1,1.0,False

If you need to **reduce anxiety fast**, here are the top three **Science-backed** techniques that work almost instantly:

# 1. Deep Breathing (Box Breathing or 4-7-8 Technique)

‚úÖ **How it works:**

* Controls the nervous system by activating the **parasympathetic response** (rest & relax mode).
* Lowers **cortisol levels** (the stress hormone).
* Slows the heart rate, reducing panic-like symptoms.

‚úÖ **How to do it (Box Breathing Method):**

1. **Inhale** deeply through your nose for **4 seconds**.
2. **Hold** your breath for **4 seconds**.
3. **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for **4 seconds**.
4. **Hold** for another **4 seconds**, then repeat.

**üî• Alternative:** The **4-7-8 breathing** method (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8) is also great for calming anxiety fast.

# 2. Grounding Technique (5-4-3-2-1 Method)

‚úÖ **How it works:**

* **Stops overthinking** by shifting focus from anxious thoughts to the **present moment**.
* Engages **all five senses**, helping you **reconnect with reality** instead of spiraling into worry.

‚úÖ **How to do it:**

1. **Name 5 things you see** üñºÔ∏è
2. **Touch 4 things around you** ü§≤ (e.g., feel your clothing, a table, or your phone)
3. **Listen for 3 sounds** üé∂ (e.g., birds, traffic, your breathing)
4. **Identify 2 scents** üåø (e.g., coffee, fresh air, essential oils)
5. **Focus on 1 thing you taste** üçè (e.g., gum, tea, or even the inside of your mouth)

**üî• Pro Tip:** Pair this with deep breathing for **instant anxiety relief**.

# 3. Cold Water Therapy (Shock Your Nervous System)

‚úÖ **How it works:**

* Stimulates the **vagus nerve**, which **instantly reduces stress** and lowers **heart rate & blood pressure**.
* Distracts your mind from anxious thoughts by **forcing your body into the present moment**.

‚úÖ **How to do it:**

* **Splash cold water** on your face for **30 seconds**.
* **Hold an ice cube** in your hands.
* **Take a cold shower** (if you can handle it).

**üî• Pro Tip:** If you're in a full-blown **panic attack**, dunk your face in **ice-cold water** for 10-15 seconds. This is a **scientific hack** called the **mammalian dive reflex**, which **slows your heart rate instantly** and reduces panic.

# Extra Tip: Move Your Body (Walk or Shake it Out)

* Physical movement **burns off excess adrenaline** that fuels anxiety.
* Even **jumping up & down for 30 seconds** helps **release nervous energy** fast!

I hope this helps you!

1jaw1f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachinginjapan/comments/1jaw1f2/starting_my_own_english_schoolclub_advice_welcomed/,Starting my own English School/Club - Advice Welcomed,"Hi guys,

I'm currently a housewife, however my husband is buying us a home closer to his work  and by chance the house has a large, 2-story business building attached (current owner runs her own salon). Since we're moving to an area that's trying to maintain and grow it's children's population and we have a young child, we'll receive 500,000 yen. I've asked my husband if he's okay with me opening my own English school from Wednesday through to Sunday with him doing the childcare, and requested the 500,000 yen to start up my school - both have been greenlighted. 

We seem to have enough private parking space too, so we'll be opening with zero overheads, not much competition in the area and a surprisingly high number of kids.

My aim is from age 1 to 12 as this is where my skills are strongest, and I enjoy it. Class sizes will be capped to 6 although I'll allow 1 ""make-up"" in a class on a first come first served basis.

Here are some of my queries I hope people could help with:

1. How to recruit students? I'm completely new to this town, my Japanese needs improving (which I'll work on). I'm planning to have 2 weeks of open week this August then start from September.

2. How to set up a website? 

3. Where to get classroom supplies / furniture? Professional business sign - I've already got a logo.

4. For the youngest class (age 1 and 2) there will be a guardian present but after that the parents are free to relax downstairs in what will be a free coffee shop style room with probably a selection of baked goods to snack on (I enjoy baking). However, if the parents go offsite and a child has a toilet accident or something which halts the class, what do you do? Do you refund everyone or do a make-up lesson for that class? 

5. For the younger classes I'm sorting out my own ""lessons"" which are a lot of playing tbh, but for the elementary age kids I'd like to use a text series to give the class some structure - so any recommendations are welcome.

6. My calendar is 44 weeks teaching, with payment every 4 weeks (I'm taking the whole of August off) - how would you recommend I take payments both initially, and then if successful in the long term? Do you give a receipt?

7. I'm aware that once the business has commenced that I need to submit a business-start-up notification to the city office, but are there any other legal procedures I need to be aware of?

8. What kind of insurance would you advise? Liability etc - as working on my own with groups of children is an obvious risk - hence having an area for the parents downstairs.

9. The biggest space upstairs has an open top staircase - is there anyway to get that covered for safety?

10. Any other advice - I've never run a business before, so I'm anticipating there will be setbacks that I've not even considered.

I have constant migraines and I try to teach them better ways to communicate but nothing works. Their parents aren‚Äôt any better for this because I‚Äôm not allowed to take the kids outside, they get coffee and donuts for breakfast every day or every other day, they don‚Äôt take naps, can‚Äôt watch tv or anything while I‚Äôm here. These parents are also killing me because they act like I have no life outside of work and f me over. They asked me to watch their kids for date night and said 4:30-8 so I watched them until 8 and they weren‚Äôt home then they messaged and asked if they can come home BY nine and they didn‚Äôt even let me answer before just staying out later and 9:00 came, 9:10, 9:15 and by that point I messaged them and they said they will be home in another 20 minutes. Like don‚Äôt say 4:30-8 then not get home until 10 without any heads up or even making sure I‚Äôm okay to work that late. The moms older kids were home just playing video games like why couldn‚Äôt they take over when I was supposed to be off? It‚Äôs just incredible frustrating.

1javyuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaliRelationships/comments/1javyuy/dont_even_bother_posting_yourself/,Don‚Äôt even bother posting yourself,"
I‚Äôve seen a couple of posts about tabarruij and posting yourself online, and honestly, I hear it. Then I see people asking, ‚ÄúHow do I get married? How do I find someone?‚Äù And then  there‚Äôs always that ONEEE  person saying, ‚ÄúPost yourself, put yourself out there on socials.‚Äù Let me tell you, that rarely works.

I‚Äôve been through that whole phase, and trust me, it welcomes unwarranted attention . I wasn‚Äôt even trying to get married at the time I just enjoyed posting. I‚Äôd be on public, with a decent number of followers, (fyi I never posted anything inappropriate, revealing, or explicit. I wear hijab and always remained modest. )Still, the men who slid into my DMs weren‚Äôt men with good intentions. They were just looking to hit up anything that breathes.

So this advice to single girls to ‚Äúput yourself out there‚Äù by going public on Instagram, posting  is a set-up for failure. Then When we tell them ‚Äú I don‚Äôt want to post myself ‚Äú they say ‚Äú well you‚Äôll be single forever ‚Äú or ‚Äú good luck then‚Äù but why is that such a bad thing ? IMO You‚Äôre much better off meeting someone in real life, in an appropriate setting, like at the mosque, charity events, work, coffee shop or grocery store literally anywhere but online. Posting yourself online only attracts unwanted attention from desperate men with akhlaqxuumo. no one has time for some  so and so  ‚Äúreplied to your story‚Äù

if you want to post just for vibes you enjoy that‚Äôs all you But don‚Äôt post with the INTENTION that the man of your dreams will find you that way. I‚Äôm aware it has worked for some people, but it‚Äôs not the best approach, esp for sisters who aren‚Äôt even comfortable sharing their beauty with the world. No matter how modest you look, it‚Äôs usually the lustful men you‚Äôll attract when posting online because they see that as a green light and an open invitation, even if it isn‚Äôt meant to be that way. the men worth your time will approach you in person and ask for your hand like a real man let‚Äôs be Fr ",8,1741927164.0,SomaliRelationships,13,0.91,False

I'm a 32M gf is 27F Throwaway account. My gf and I have been seeing each other for a year and 3 months and spent almost every day together (unless we had our own family/work stuff to deal with.) I live about 7 mins away paying mortgage at my house with a couple roommates and she lives in a rental duplex situation. Sometimes she drives over to pick me up after work.

She started feeling sick for a couple days with some kind of cold so she was generally ornery and didn't want to interact much. On the third day of this, she says she wants to go see a doctor and asks if she could take me home early. She says on the way back to my house that she wants some space or alone time because she's an introvert and needs time to recharge.

This felt like it came out of nowhere and being in other relationships previously where this usually means, I want space until I've decided I'm completely done with you. The insecurities and anxiety inside started taking over. I tried just minimally texting and still ended up helping her out by going to her house while she was working to drop off some carrot cake and do some chores for her to make it easier on her. We exchanged the occasional I love yous but she didn't really reciprocate missing me much.

This is where I started fucking up really bad. I asked if it was okay if I could come over after the third day of not seeing her and she responded that she wasn't sure, then I asked her to specify and she just said she didn't know. I left it at that at the time, but 4 hours later I proceeded to drive over after she was off from work at 12:30 am to be with her. When I showed up she even said that I scared her and I apologized, we cuddled and went to sleep after watching some shows.

The next morning she has a killer headache and asks me to make coffee while she goes to take a shower. I feel like at this point I really fucked up, so instead of doing the right thing and talking to her about it, I (like an idiot) go through her phone to see if she was mentioning anything to her sister about the whole situation of needing space with me. I immediately felt a hot wash of shame and closed it after a couple seconds regretting what I did, and started doing more chores feeling guilty while she tried to feel better.

When she gets out she plays a game alone, I mention something wrong with my computer and try to play it off non-chalantly, obviously ashamed of what I did. Then the clincher: she noticed I went through her phone based on how she left it and how it was slightly off. She questions me about it, and initially I lie saying that I didn't go through it. She pushes further and I come clean saying honestly that I felt insecure about the current situation so I looked. She asks me to leave.

I apologize (improperly, just saying im really sorry and not really explaining the mistake or how to improve) and proceed to have a total breakdown saying that it wasn't that I didn't trust her but I was just looking for answers in her conversations with her sister that she tells everything to since she wasn't telling me anything other than shes an introvert. She didn't even say anything ti her sister about it. She says I could have communicated with her about it but everytime I did she wouldn't give me a straight answer or just revert to saying she's an introvert and wanted her own space. This alone was truth enough to show me how much of an asshole I was. We exchanged I love yous, I hugged her, and I left.

A day later I say sorry and want to apologize in person properly. She says maybe in a few days and I agree to it, and say if she needs more time then take your time. I say I love her, no response.

We don't text or talk or see eachother for 2 days. 3rd day I just ask how she's doing, she says she has a headache, I say it sucks and hope she feels better. Later on I offer to help her at work to ease her load.

She says no thank you. I don't mean to be rude or to have any misunderstanding, but please don't come over tonight or ever come over uninvited. I say I understand and if she doesn't want me to talk to her until she's ready to talk then it wouldn't be rude of her to say that either. She changes her profile picture on Facebook from us being in the photo to just her. Felt like she's sick of seeing me.

At this point can I even do anything to save this relationship? Did I just solidify the end by betraying her respect and trust in one fell swoop?

I figure that the best thing to do is just give her the space and time to respond to me when she's ready but idk what else to do. I wrote out a full apology explaining my mistakes for when she's ready to hear it, starting with disrespecting her need for space and lack of communication on how I felt. Then the violation of her privacy and audacity to lie to cover it up. Haven't had a chance to read it to her since she doesn't want to see me.

I'm beyond ashamed and remorseful for what I've done and I feel like she doesn't even want to hear it. I've even begun mourning the end of the relationship as if it's ended since I feel like I've effectively ended it on my own by being an insecure mess. Any advice at this point would help but I already feel like I've messed up to the point where it's just going to be confirmation that I totally messed this whole thing up.

Understanding which religions don‚Äôt drink coffee can be fascinating. Coffee, a beloved beverage worldwide, holds significant cultural importance. Yet, certain religions discourage or prohibit its consumption. This prohibition often stems from religious teachings or health guidelines. Learning about these practices offers insight into diverse beliefs and traditions.

It also highlights the impact of religion on daily habits. Discovering which religions don‚Äôt drink coffee can broaden your perspective. It can also increase your appreciation for cultural diversity. Join us as we explore these unique religious practices and the reasons behind them.

# Religious Perspectives On Coffee

Many religions have specific guidelines on food and drink. Coffee, a beloved beverage worldwide, is no exception. Some religious groups avoid coffee due to their beliefs. Understanding these perspectives offers insight into the diverse ways that faith influences daily habits.

# Cultural Beliefs

Religious views on coffee often stem from cultural beliefs. For example, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) advises against coffee consumption. This guidance is part of the Word of Wisdom, a health code revealed to founder Joseph Smith in 1833.

According to the Word of Wisdom, members should avoid ‚Äúhot drinks,‚Äù which church leaders interpret as coffee and tea. This belief is about maintaining physical health and spiritual well-being.

* **Health:**¬†The LDS church promotes a healthy lifestyle. Avoiding coffee is one aspect of this.
* **Spirituality:**¬†Abstaining from coffee helps members focus on spiritual growth.

Another group, the Seventh-day Adventists, also avoids coffee. They believe in living a healthy lifestyle and see coffee as potentially harmful.

|Religion|Reason for Avoiding Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|LDS Church|Health and spiritual well-being|
|Seventh-day Adventists|Health concerns|

# Historical Context

The historical context of religious beliefs about coffee is fascinating. For the LDS Church, the Word of Wisdom was a revelation given in the early 19th century. At that time, coffee was becoming popular in America. The guidance to avoid ‚Äúhot drinks‚Äù was seen as forward-thinking, promoting health long before modern science confirmed the benefits of such advice.

Seventh-day Adventists emerged in the mid-19th century. Their health message, which includes avoiding coffee, was influenced by the health reforms of the time. Leaders like Ellen G. White emphasized natural remedies and a vegetarian diet. This approach extended to avoiding stimulants like coffee.

* **19th Century Health Reforms:**¬†Both the LDS and Seventh-day Adventist movements were influenced by broader health reforms.
* **Natural Remedies:**¬†These religions promoted natural living and avoiding stimulants.

These historical contexts show how religious beliefs are often shaped by the times in which they develop. Understanding these roots helps us appreciate the depth of these cultural practices.

# Islamic Views

Coffee is a beloved beverage worldwide, but some religions have specific guidelines about its consumption. Islam, one of the world‚Äôs major religions, has diverse views on drinking coffee. This blog explores the Islamic perspective on coffee, highlighting the general stance and variations among different sects.

# General Stance

Islamic teachings are based on the Quran and Hadith. Generally, Islam does not prohibit coffee. Coffee is considered permissible, or ‚Äúhalal,‚Äù for Muslims. Islamic law bans intoxicants, but coffee does not fall under this category.

Some key points include:

* Coffee is not considered an intoxicant.
* It does not impair judgment or behavior.
* Many Islamic scholars allow coffee consumption.

Historically, coffee has had a strong presence in Islamic culture. Coffee houses, known as ‚Äúqahveh khaneh,‚Äù were popular in the Middle East. These places were social hubs where people gathered to drink coffee and discuss various topics.

# Variations Among Sects

Islam has different sects, including Sunni and Shia. These sects have varying interpretations of Islamic law. This affects views on many aspects of daily life, including coffee consumption.

Some differences among sects:

* **Sunni Muslims:**¬†Generally, Sunni Muslims have a lenient view on coffee. Most Sunni scholars allow coffee as it is not harmful.
* **Shia Muslims:**¬†Shia Muslims also permit coffee. They follow similar reasoning to Sunni Muslims. They believe coffee is not an intoxicant.

Within these sects, there are also cultural variations. In some regions, coffee is a staple of social life. In others, it may be less common but still accepted.

While Islam does not have a blanket ban on coffee, individual preferences may vary. Some Muslims may avoid coffee for personal or health reasons. Overall, coffee is widely accepted in the Islamic world.

# Buddhism And Caffeine

In Buddhism, the relationship with caffeine, especially coffee, is nuanced. While not all Buddhists abstain from coffee, certain practices and monastic rules influence their consumption. This article explores how mindfulness and specific guidelines shape their approach to caffeine.

# Mindfulness Practices

Buddhism emphasizes mindfulness in daily life. This includes being aware of what you consume. Caffeine, known for its stimulating effects, can impact one‚Äôs ability to maintain a calm and focused mind. Buddhists practicing mindfulness might avoid coffee for several reasons:

* **Maintaining Calm:**¬†Caffeine can cause jitteriness, which disrupts inner peace.
* **Better Sleep:**¬†Good rest supports meditation and mindfulness practices.
* **Health Considerations:**¬†Some believe caffeine can affect overall well-being.

A table below illustrates how caffeine consumption can impact mindfulness:

|Effect of Caffeine|Impact on Mindfulness|
|:-|:-|
|Increased alertness|Can aid in focus but may lead to over-stimulation|
|Jitteriness|Disrupts calmness and inner peace|
|Sleep disruption|Leads to fatigue, affecting meditation quality|

For many Buddhists, the choice to avoid caffeine aligns with their goal of maintaining a clear and tranquil state of mind.

# Monastic Rules

Buddhist monastic rules, known as Vinaya, offer guidance on various aspects of life, including diet. While caffeine is not explicitly forbidden, certain principles influence its consumption:

* **Avoiding Intoxicants:**¬†Monks and nuns avoid substances that alter the mind.
* **Simple Living:**¬†A simple diet supports a simple, focused life.
* **Health and Well-being:**¬†Monastic rules promote practices that support physical and mental health.

Monastics often follow a set routine, including specific eating times. Drinking coffee might disrupt these routines:

|Monastic Routine|Potential Disruption from Caffeine|
|:-|:-|
|Early morning meditation|Stimulation from caffeine can make meditation challenging|
|Set meal times|Caffeine can reduce appetite, affecting meal routines|
|Rest periods|Caffeine might interfere with rest and recovery|

While not all Buddhists are monastics, these rules influence the broader community. Many lay Buddhists adopt similar practices to support their spiritual development. Avoiding caffeine helps them align with the principles of their faith.

# Hinduism‚Äôs Approach

Have you ever wondered if there are religions that avoid drinking coffee? One fascinating example is Hinduism. This ancient religion has a unique approach to many aspects of life, including dietary habits and spiritual practices. In this blog post, we will explore Hinduism‚Äôs approach to coffee consumption and understand the underlying reasons behind it.

# Spiritual Practices

Hinduism places a strong emphasis on spiritual practices and routines. Many followers believe that what they consume can affect their spiritual well-being. For example, some devout Hindus practice¬†**Ayurveda**, an ancient system of medicine. Ayurveda recommends a balanced diet that supports both the body and mind.

Here are a few points about the spiritual practices related to food and drink:

* **Mindfulness**: Hindus practice mindfulness in their daily routines. This includes being aware of what they eat and drink.
* **Purity**: Consuming pure and natural foods is considered important. Processed or stimulating beverages like coffee may be avoided.
* **Meditation**: Some Hindus meditate daily. They believe that certain foods and drinks, including coffee, can disturb the mind and hinder meditation.

Furthermore, many Hindus follow a¬†**Sattvic diet**. This diet focuses on foods that promote clarity, calmness, and spiritual growth. Coffee, being a stimulant, is often excluded from a Sattvic diet. Instead, they prefer herbal teas or warm milk, which are seen as more calming and spiritually beneficial.

# Dietary Restrictions

Dietary restrictions in Hinduism can vary widely depending on the sect, region, and personal beliefs. While not all Hindus avoid coffee, certain groups and individuals might do so for various reasons.

Here are some common dietary guidelines observed by many Hindus:

* **Vegetarianism**: Many Hindus follow a vegetarian diet, avoiding meat and animal products.
* **Avoiding stimulants**: Some Hindus avoid stimulants like coffee, tea, and alcohol. They believe these substances can disrupt their mental and spiritual balance.
* **Fasting**: Fasting is a common practice in Hinduism. During fasts, they might avoid certain foods and drinks, including coffee.

In certain Hindu traditions, the consumption of coffee is seen as tamasic. Tamasic foods are believed to promote inertia and dullness of mind. Followers of these traditions prefer to avoid such foods and drinks to maintain their spiritual purity and mental clarity.

My bf and i have been together for 4 months now and we've been going strong. communication between is amazing and any conflicts usually get solved day-of. To start, i have no ""need"" to snoop through his phone because he's very open with it and ive used it on his behalf (as per his request like googling, messaging myself, or responding to a business dm). the only thing he's a little protective of is his camera roll because he has embarrassing selfies of him that he doesnt want me to see, but even then when he opens it he doesnt fully block my view of it, just kinda angles it and scrolls fast. he has told me before ""you have full control of my phone i dont care what you do on it."" which is endearing but like i said, i dont need to go snooping around because i trust him. 

now for my situation, i also have nothing that a boyfriend wouldnt want to see on my phone. my conversations on instagram & messages are completely normal and cordial, my google has dorky anime stuff or coffee and food places, and my camera roll is just a bunch of adventure pictures of friends, food and drink places, a thousand memes, and 2 thousand pictures of my cat. even my reddit just has dorky things! whenever i open my camera roll, messages app, or instagram dms, he joking goes ""ah!"" and looks away/covers his eyes. i have told him countless times that there is nothing i wouldnt want him seeing on my phone (after i broke up w my ex, i deleted all photos and conversations with him because i didnt want to see them). he says he refuses to look at my phone. i told him im not begging him to essentially break in and go through every app and snoop, but if i even ask him to reply to someone or google something on my phone he wont. i once put my phone down screen up on the counter and wanted to go through my camera roll and show him the different trips ive been on (i have adhd so id lowkey stop and show him different photos that caught my attention that werent trip related) and he would say ""i dont want to see your camera roll just find the pictures and show me"" ive had conversations with him about this and he says its for his own peace of mind, and he'll say ""you never know"" but i tell him it means he doesnt trust me. even if he says he does, it means there is a tiny iota of distrust that causes him to avoid my phone like the plague. He said, and i quote ""cause myself and EVERYONE i know has thought ‚Äúshe‚Äôd (his ex) never do that‚Äù then found out she did. and to keep myself from experiencing that again i just decide to not even be nosey. it has literally nothing to do with you, even before we were dating i told you i‚Äôd never want to do that.""

I told him he was basically punishing me for the things his ex did and that it was unfair of him to do that. Am i overreacting at this whole thing and AITA? Im not ragingly upset at him for this, like i still want to talk to him and see him and whatnot, but it just puts a small cloud over my head. Please dont just say ""break up with him"" because this genuinely doesnt affect our relationship to such an extreme. thank you for reading guys!

TLDR: My bf looks away in ""fear"" every time i open an insta or imessage convo, or camera roll/google on my phone because ""you never know."" he says its because he found things on his exes phone he didnt want to see and doesnt want to experience the pain again.",1,1741926494.0,AITAH,8,0.67,False

A month after this, I decided to use it, and as soon as I opened it there was a strong bitter coffee smell in my flask. I thought it wouldn't mess with my water, but I was wrong.

Every single time I open it up to drink, there's an evident black coffee taste in my water.

I tried my best cleaning out the smell, I would soak it over night with water, tried both cold and hot, didn't work. I tried putting in water with tons of dishsoap and soaked it too, both hot and cold again, didn't work.

Imagine The Bear meets A Theater Rehearsal but with the comedic chaos of a raccoon on cocaine and a script that says ""fuck"" more times than a Tarantino flick. It's smart. It's sharp. It's ART.

I show it to strangers (random people on the internet, a few at a coffee shop, maybe a goblin under a bridge) and they LOVE it. They‚Äôre laughing. Crying. Quoting it. I swear one guy told me he saw God for a second.

But my ""friends""? Oh no. They see the first ten f-bombs and recoil like Victorian-era ladies whose corsets are suddenly too tight. ""Too much swearing,"" they say, clutching their pearls. ""This is garbage,"" they declare, having read exactly NONE of it. I could hand them the Citizen Kane of screenplays, and they‚Äôd still be like ""ew, words.""

So now I‚Äôm wondering, do I just keep writing the high-octane, turbocharged chaos that actually makes people laugh? Or do I yeet these so-called friends into the sun and replace them with people who actually appreciate good comedy?

1javnpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1javnpi/another_coffee_gate_moment/,Another coffee gate moment?,"Hey all.

So after the hilarious coffee gate scandal over the last few days, I thought I would bring to your attention something similar that my co worker did.

We work in the CBD and on Wednesday (mid morning) we were both working and he came up to me and asked if I wanted to go with him to the convenience store down the street to grab a soft drink, as he was going.

I clearly stated to him that i had my water, so wouldnt grab a drink, but would come for a walk to stretch my legs and have a chat/catch up.

We get to the convenience store and he grabs 2 Pepsi Max's and hands me one (Remember i told him that i wasn't going to buy one for myself)

If someone hands you a drink, without you asking, you would assume they are shouting you right? 

Well he then walks up to the counter to pay, and as he is doing that, I decide to crack open the Pepsi bottle he handed me and take a sip. 

Even though I told him I didn't want to grab a drink, he handed it to me, so I assumed he was shouting me, so I accepted it, and opened it for a little sip, and was going to keep the rest for lunch. 

He is finished paying and we start to walk out the door and he looks me dead in the face and goes ""aren't you going to pay for your drink?""

Obviously the cashier has heard this. I turn around and we lock eyes. I'm now holding an open Pepsi max and walking out the door without paying, and worst of all, my co worker is standing there with a puzzled look on his face like ""wtf is this guy doing trying to walk out without paying""

I'm standing there with an equally puzzled look on my face thinking ""you handed me a drink when I specifically said I wasn't going to buy one. I assumed you were shouting me you jackass""

The drink is now open, so I had no choice but to sheepishly walk back to the cashier and say ""oh sorry mate, my mistake""

My co worker and I walk back to the office and neither of us bring up what just happened, but I am completely flim flammed. 

In that situation,  if someone hands you a drink after you specifically told them that you wouldn't buy one for yourself, and then proceeds to the cashier, wouldn't you assume that they were shouting you the drink?

Lesson learnt. No more accepting drinks from co workers i think. 

Hope this brought you some joy on your Friday afternoon haha.

In your opinions, what is the smallest and most comfortable city with the best public transit?

I'd like to home in on a city where I can easily live without a vehicle while having at least the basic ""city perks"" without being in one that's too large and crowded. I've pondered jumping into the province life with both feet to get away, but also trying to be honest with myself.

Doesn't need a night life as I don't drink nor party. Maybe a mall, a nice coffee shop, a movie theater would be nice and a couple of once in a while places to change it up during those months I've squirreled some extra spending money to treat myself with. That and of course a place or two to get groceries/necessities would be more than enough big city living for me. Thoughts of something like Cebu City or Manila scare me personally.

The closer to public beaches and natural beauty I could enjoy if I wanted to rent a bike for the week or weekend would be ideal. I'd say in walking distance but feel like I'm wanting my cake and eat it too at that point. Renting a little condo on a beach right by everything would be too perfect and asking for too much.
