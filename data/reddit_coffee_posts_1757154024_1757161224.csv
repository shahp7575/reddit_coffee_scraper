I’ve been living in the city for a while now, but lately, I’ve been craving meeting some new people. Most of my old friends are either busy with their careers, married, or just too caught up in their lives to make spontaneous plans. I miss those fun conversations and exploring the city without feeling judged or pressured.

If you’re someone who loves discovering cosy cafes, craft brewers, rooftop spots, or just wants to explore the exciting, artsy, or offbeat corners of the city, I’m all ears.

I’m looking for open-minded people who share my curiosity, love for laughter, and enjoy low-key adventures. Whether you’re new here or just looking to break out of your usual circle, feel free to reach out.

Let’s start with coffee and see where it takes us. 🙂

P.S. I haven’t mentioned my age or what I do. I thought we could chat and discover those things naturally when we connect. I live in Viman Nagar.

1n9y49n,https://www.reddit.com/r/predprey/comments/1n9y49n/the_day_after/,The Day After,"	The sun is shining through my window, blinding me. Ugh, I was hoping to get a bit more sleep after last night but I guess the world is against me. I reach over and grab my phone, I check the lock screen, it’s 6:23, just before my alarm, and, ugh, messages from Dad, of course… I’m not even going to check them. Anyways, about an hour and a half until I my shift starts, I should probably get up, go get ready. I head to the washroom to clean up: brush my teeth, take my meds, my whole morning routine, but I stop when I see myself in the mirror. Most things seem normal, roughly 160 cm (\~5’3”), white fur, no proper hair, my genetics just don’t seem to allow it, but looking closer at my face I realize why it looked off; I look terrible, the white fur on my cheeks is still matted with the tears from last night and I can see the bags under my eyes. It makes sense that I got such poor sleep, I nearly died last night, even if they didn’t really do anything… what were they even thinking? a canine following a rabbit down the street at night, they should have known better, should have realized I was freaking out, should have taken a different route…

\*snap\*

\*snap\*

\*sna-\*

	I grab my hand, I don’t need to get so stressed out over this, it already happened, they even didn’t do anything wrong, I was just overthinking things, like I always do... I really need to wash my fur, I can’t go out looking like this. Get back on task. I splash some water onto my cheeks, rubbing it into my fur, getting all the dried salt, tears and whatever else off my face. That looks a bit better, now to get on with things. Taking my medicine, brushing my teeth, brushing my fur. Okay, now that everything’s done with, I need to head to work. A closing shift, then an opening one the next morning, just my luck. After dressing, A light blue winter jacket, with a yellow shirt and black jeans, I head out into the cold winter morning. I head down the snow covered street, surrounded by tall buildings on all sides. Further down the street, I make it to that corner from last night, I cross my arms and hold them tight, I really don’t want to start thinking about this right now… I pick up my pace, not wanting to linger.

	Finally, I’ve made it to Syncafé, the coffee shop I work at. Entering through the front door I hear a shout, “Roma! There you are.” that’s Casey, a deer that radiates positivity, they’re probably my favourite coworker here, they’re both pleasant to be around and they don’t seem to mind that I get kinda cagey sometimes, I do like spending ti- oh, I should say something, I haven’t said anything yet. “Hi Casey, it’s nice to see you.” I respond. “It’s nice to see you too. Hey, are you doing alright? You’re normally here, like, a lot earlier than this.” Umm, would it be rude to mention what happened? I mean, they kinda asked but I don’t want to just dump that on them out of nowhere, they’re probably just being polite. “I just didn’t sleep very well last night I wasn’t really expecting a late shift.” I guess I didn’t really lie, I really wasn’t expecting to work late, but I still feel kinda bad. “Okay, well, we’re gonna open in, what… it’s 7:43 so in about 15 minutes, you just go get yourself ready.” I nod, heading to the staff area.

	The café is pretty full now, it’s interesting watching everyone that comes in, mostly herbivores, some omnivores, I’ve noticed that carnivores tend to avoid this place, it might be because there are none on staff, that or because people might start staring, I’ve never noticed anyone staring here but I’ve seen it happen elsewhere. Regardless, we normally get at least one or two carnivores but it doesn’t seem so today. My body freezes, alarm bells started ringing in my head just now but I don’t know why, I feel like I’m being watched. Is that a shadow behin- “Hello miss” Instinctively I jump, smacking against the counter in my scramble to make some distance. My heart starts racing and my mind is telling me one thing: run run run run run. Wait, I can’t run, I’m working I can’t just leave, but what was behind me? Why was it so close to me? I turn around and there’s a cat at the counter. Why were they behind me? Oh no, are they a customer? Shit. How do I recover this. Say something, “Uh-” “Are you alright miss? Sorry, did I scare you?” Their voice is sending shivers up my spine, I feel like I need to bolt, to get as far as possible. “Um, y-yeah, you did. Sorry, I wasn’t really p-paying attention, you snuck up on me.” Don’t run. Don’t run. Don’t run. Just walk up and take their order. “Uh, a-anyways, what d-did you want to get?” I can’t make myself take a single step towards them, my body won’t let me, but that’s fine, act normal, calm down and just act normal. I need to stop shaking, I can barely talk to them like this. Calm down, calm down, calm do- “Hey, Roma, I can take over for you.” Casey, what a life saver. “Alright, thank you, Casey.” I walk to the staff room, holding onto the counter for support. My legs won’t work properly, I can barely even walk straight, I just need to run, to hide, anything. Where should I go? There’s the back door… I don’t want to go into the alleyway, I’ll be too exposed. Um… Um… Fuck, what do I do. Oh, there’s the supply closet, I can go in there. I try to stumble my way towards the door, nearly falling several times, and make my way inside. I close the door behind me and lean against it to keep it closed. It’s dark in here, but I’m safe. That cat is out there and I’m in here. I’m safe, it can’t find me, I’m safe, I’m safe, I’m safe…

	Breathe in… breathe out… breathe in… breathe out… Okay, alright, I think I’m okay now. I should probably go see Casey, I don’t want to leave them by themself out there. Fuck, I should also go apologize to that cat, I probably made a scene. A small shudder runs down my spine as I leave the safe darkness behind and step out of the closet. When I leave the staff area I find Casey standing near the register. “Hey, Casey. Thanks for taking over for me back there, sorry about all that.” I say. “Oh, it’s no problem Roma, are you feeling any better? Calmed down?” “Yeah, I’m doing alright now. I, um, wanted to apologize to that cat from before, is he still here?” I start looking around the café. “Yes, he is. just over there.” They point over to a table where I get to see the one who scared me so badly in better detail; he looks to be a serval, he has light-brown, almost yellow fur that becomes a far darker brown around the tips of his ears and on his spots, and a far lighter brown, almost white, near their neck and, presumably, around their stomach too, though I can’t see it through his shirt. He’s working on a laptop alone at a table, he also has a back-pack with him so he might be a student? roma… His clothes are also quite casual so a student would make sense. roma… He really doesn’t look all too scary, it must have just been that I was caught off guard- “Roma!” Someone jostles my shoulder. “Huh?” I say out of reflex. Oh, Casey’s been trying to talk to me. “Goodness Roma, you’ve been standing here staring at this guy for like 30 seconds get a move on, you look like a weirdo.” “Oh, yeah, sorry.” I say before shuffling off to go apologize. As I approach him I see several of the guests casting glances at him, though he doesn’t take his eyes off of his laptop, determinedly typing away, and I wonder if I should even say anything, I don’t really want to interrupt him. Whatever, I’m already over here so I should say something. “Umm… Hi, uh.” I start. He looks up at me, “Hi. Oh, are you the rabbit girl from the counter?” “Yeah, I wanted to come apologize for running off earlier… I shouldn’t have done that, I’m sorry.” I continue. “Oh, it’s no problem, really, I shouldn’t have snuck up on you like that.” It is a problem. If it were no problem, people wouldn’t be watching us like they’re waiting for him to pounce on me while we’re having this conversation. It’s really unnerving “It’s on me, I should have been able to control myself better. Do you want, like, a bagel or something? I could get you a free… something.” I offer. “No, no, you don’t need to.” “Please, I really want to.” I insist. “…Alright then, if you won’t let me say no, a bagel is fine; just an everything bagel, toasted with some butter.” He relents, finally. “Okay, I’ll be right back.” I get up and head back to the counter. I toast the bagel, spread some butter on it and bring it to him. “Here you go, one everything bagel.” I say as I place the wrapped bagel on the table. “Thank you, you really didn’t need to do this you know.” “It was the least I could do for causing a scene and embarrassing you.” I explain. “I have to get back to work now, I hope I see you again sometime. Have good day.” I say, walking back to my post. “Bye.” He says as I leave.

	Today has been a lot, so many customers, and… my freak-out… All in all it’s been really stressful, though the cat waved at me when he left, which I thought was nice. I’m ready to just head home and rest, I feel like I could sleep for days.

Wait… I didn’t even ask for his name.",1,1757161138.0,predprey,0,1.0,False
1n9y2jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1n9y2jz/seeking_support_for_my_gi_issues/,Seeking support for my GI issues,"Hi all. I’ve been having really bad GI issues that fluctuate and make me super confused. It started back in May / June when I experienced chest pain for the first time. Which I later found out was heartburn. My doctor put me on omeprazole, which I didn’t take right away. Then it progressed into me burping while I ate   and then I basically could not eat anything for three days because my esophagus was so inflamed. I’ve lost 13 pounds because of how little my portions have had to become. 

So they didn’t endoscopy and diagnosed me with Gerd and said I had mild chronic inflammation where my stomach meets my esophagus. 

So I went on a low acid diet and I have been doing everything possible to heal. No coffee, no chocolate I eat really bland things that are easy to go down like oatmeal or cereal with almond milk, turkey wraps, home made banana bread. And it seems like I was on the right track, but it’s been two months and I had a bad flare yesterday where I would eat a couple bites and get really full.

I completed a barium swallow, which came back normal, I also had a CT scan and just completed a SIBO test which I’m waiting on the results for. My doctor wants to test me for gastroparesis, which I’m praying I don’t have. Especially because I have good days where I can eat more and some bad days where I can’t eat much. I’m not vomiting, I’m not super nauseous. Maybe a little bit nauseous. I do have early satiety right now and burping helps relieve the pressure in my stomach. I sometimes wake up with a sore throat from reflux. But the symptoms aren’t consistent. Can anyone else share their experience?",1,1757160989.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1n9y0j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MayConfessionAko/comments/1n9y0j2/may_confession_ako_i_deliberately_exposed_my/,May Confession Ako. I deliberately exposed my cheating neighbor to her family during her daughter's 18th birthday.,"I have this police officer na kapitbahay. She is a SPO3 officer somewhere here in Mindanao. So, ito na yung chika. Yung kapitbahay naming police ay may pagka swapang. Yung lupang binili nila katabi ng lupa nila. Lola ko yung binilhan nila ng lupa kasi yung lola ko is ninang ni Mrs. Police. Mura lang mga 700k yung 100sq.meter. So ito na. Before sila nagkapirmahan may agreement sila ng lola ko na dapat may maliit na daanan or right of way sa gilid para yung sasakyan namin sa likod may madadaanan. 

Ngayon, right after my lola died last year, itong si Mrs. Police pinalagyan niya ng fence yung paligid ng bahay nila. Ang nakaka galit kasi yung right of way sa likod na dinadaanan ng mga kapitbahay namin ay ipinasok nila sa fence. Kinausap namin sila pero itong si Police sadyang nagmamataas. Sabi niya na wala nadaw yung agreement nila kasi patay na daw yung lola ko. So, parang naging void na daw yung agreement nila. Dinala namin sila sa barangay but since yung kapitan namin ay kapatid ni Police kaya walang ariglong nangyari.

Then, fast forward. Itong fence ni Police ay may sira, so yung aso nila nakalabas. Yung pamangkin ko ay naglalaro sa veranda namin. May hawak siyang tinapay at isang basong coke. He was just 7 years old. Ngayon, nakita ng aso nila kaya kinagat ng aso ang tinapay dinala sa kanila. Nabigla nalang kami na umiiyak na yung pamangkin ko. We tried to approach them and talk to them about the incident pero since WALA DAW EVIDENCE na aso nila ang kumagat kaya hindi sila nagbigay ng tulong. Nasa loob daw ng bahay nila yung aso at may fence daw kaya impossible daw na makalabas ang aso.

Sinabiban namin sila tungkol sa sira ng fence pero they still denied everything. Since then wala na kaming communication. Buti naman yung pamangkin ko napaturokan ng anti rabbies at naging okey na.

Ngayon, we had this psa survey in every barangay here in Agusan del Norte. And I found out na during the survey, nakita ko itong si Police sa isang coffee shop together with another policeman (kakilala ko kasi ang lalaki kasi palagi itong nagpupunta sa kanila every fiesta) pero naka civilian sila, they were very sweet. She did'nt notice me, pero they seem to be like couples they even  kiss . Kaya pala linggo na siya umuuwi kasi pinupuntahan niya pala yung kabit niya. I keep that as a secret. Now, when I got home, while scrolling my FB may nakita akong post ng isang vlogger na may picture picture siya sakin na nakasakay ng motor. ""PITIK NI MOTOVLOG""

I immediately got this bold idea. Ido document ko lahat ng pakikiapid niya. Since, hindi niya naman alam na malalit lang yung pinagsusurveyhan namin kung saan sila nagtatrabaho, so I decided to have my revenge. Lintik lang ang walang ganti. 

So ang ginawa ko kinuha ko yung camera ng kaibigan ko na gusto niya isangla sa akin. Nangungulit eh na kunin ko daw kasi need niya ng pera. DSLR yun at may lens na malaki kaya pwede kang magzoom-in at zoom out. Then I take my chances.

Talagang naging spy ako for temporary. Lagi ko dala yung camera kaya yung bag ko sobrang bigat. Pinapriotize ko yung laptop instead sa tablet ng dala ko for surveying.

Then, ito na. The most awaited day ay dumating. They were having a day in a snack in, katabi sa isang barbecue stand. At don ko na inumpisahan yung pagkuha ko ng litrato nila ng kabit niya. Zinoom in ko kasi medyo malayo ako sa kanila, then sucession click. Kuha pati yung pagpunas ni lalaki sa bibig ni babae at pati yung akbayan nila paglabas. They really seem like couples pero both of them are married.

Then I decided to make it as a full time spying. Since I know a lot of their spots sinusundan ko sila. YES. Naging obsession ko yung paghihiganti, to ths point that I almost neglected my job kasi parati akong absent.

Then, the debut birthday ng anak niya came. Aba, invited si lalaki at don ko nalaman na he is someone in the high rank. Kaya pala madaling ma promote si Ms. Police officer dahil don. 

Since wala naman akong trabaho dahil sabado yun. Isa ako sa mga tumulong sa preparations ng birthday ng anak niya. I arrive early sa bahay nila. But before that prinint ko muna yung mga pictures ng mama niya with her kabit. Wallet size yung pictures at nilagay ko sa isang wallet na LV ang print (immitation lang ba binili ko sa shoppee). Ni wrap ko ng gift wrapper tapos nilagay ko sa lagayan ng mga regalo. At dahil nga maaga ako, hindi ko muna nilagay. Naghintay ako na dumami muna yung mga regalo tsaka ko plinano paao ilagay.

So ito na, dumami na yung regalo. Yung mesa na nilagyan ay foldable in half. So kapag nagslide yung paa ng mesa magsasara siya into half. At since isa ako sa mga nagprepare inayos ko ang mesa na mahuhulog siya kapag marami na ang nalagay saka ko ihuhulog yung regalo discreetly. At yun nga, I dis executed the act smoothly na hindi nila alam.

Then, ito na. The only thing I heard is that the affair was exposed by her daughter. Yung lalaki na kabit sinuntok ni husband, yung babaeng anak galit na galit sa ina. Si Mrs. Police lumuhod sa harap ng asawa ng Mr. Kabit Police kasi nalaman ng misis yung pangangaliwa. Then naging usap-usapan sila ng kapitbahay",4,1757160820.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

I’ll be traveling to France soon and need advice to improve my itinerary. My flight from a non-Schengen country arrives at CDG at 8:30 am Saturday. I have another Air France flight (same booking) from CDG to Clermont Ferrand at 9:30 pm, which is my final stop. I’m unsure if I’ll clear immigration and customs in the morning, later, or both. I might need to collect and re-check my luggage. Given this, I’ve planned a trip into central Paris to see some sights and would like feedback and suggestions to make it more efficient.

Here’s my plan:  
- 8:30 am–10:30 am: Arrival, immigration, luggage collection/storage near train station  
- 10:30 am–12:00 pm: RER B to St-Michel Notre Dame, RER C to Champ de Mars  
- 12:00–12:30 pm: Eiffel Tower  
- 12:30–1:00 pm: RER C to Musée d’Orsay, enter (will book tickets; available now)  
- 1:30–3:00 pm: Explore museum; then RER C to St-Michel Notre Dame to see Notre Dame & Sainte-Chapelle from outside  
- 5:00–6:30 pm: RER B back to CDG  
- 9:30 pm: Flight to Clermont

I’d have loved to see the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, and Jardins du Trocadéro, but it feels too rushed. Suggestions or criticism are welcome.

Also, can I book all these tickets online for 4 people?  
I’m vegetarian, so won’t be stopping for coffee, croissants, or crepes—will sort out food as I go.

I knew it was killing my focus and mood, but every time I tried to cut down, I felt miserable. Here’s what actually worked for me (and didn’t make me feel like I was missing out on life):

* **📵 No-Phone Mornings** The first 30 minutes of my day are phone-free. I charge my phone in another room, so I’m not tempted to scroll the second I wake up.
* **🔔 Kill the Notifications** I turned off *all* non-essential notifications. No random pings, no “just in case” alerts. If I want to check something, I’ll do it on my terms.
* **📊 Track It (Reality Check)** The first time I saw my screen time stats, it was brutal—but motivating. Just being aware of the number made me want to lower it.
* **📚 Replace, Don’t Just Remove** If I tell myself “no phone,” I immediately want it more. Instead, I swapped scrolling with something else: a book, a walk, journaling. The key is giving your brain another outlet.
* **📲 Helpful Tool: Cosmo AI** One of the best swaps for me was [Cosmo AI](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/cosmo-ai-quiz-flashcard/id6744305274?l=tr&utm_source=chatgpt.com). Instead of wasting time on TikTok, I upload my lecture notes or recordings, and it generates summaries, flashcards, and quizzes. Plus, the built-in Pomodoro timer means I actually *use* my screen for productive focus instead of mindless scrolling.
* **⏳ Time-Limited Apps** I set app limits for the biggest time-wasters. Even if I override them sometimes, the reminder helps break the automatic scrolling habit.
* **🌳 Go Offline (On Purpose)** Once or twice a week, I’ll leave my phone at home and go for a walk, gym, or coffee. At first it felt weird, now it feels freeing.

👉 Biggest lesson: I didn’t need to “quit my phone” I just had to *use it with intention*. Cutting screen time got way easier once I replaced it with things that actually felt good.

Always went up and down but never below 20% body fat.

Come to current day Ive suffered with this chronic bloating at different levels through my life since 21, and chronic fatigue at times with it.
It was only until last week after my 2nd week in a glp1 where these symptoms feel like they're multiplied like crazy and made me finally go back for a 2nd opinion in which my doctor said definely not liver, most likely gastro related, maybe pylori.

So I wanted to ask if anyone else felt exact same symptoms, usually I will wake up having to hold my core in or else my stomache just pushes out despite lightness of food day before, some days certain foods trigger it worse sometimes not, when I usually bloat bad I feel a chronic fatigue and dull ache, and this happens generally very quickly after food and more so coffee or energy drinks, some days they work some days I feel bloated, ingestion and so fatigued I could fall asleep at the wheel and suffer a lot of brain fog and lack of motivation.

Other then acid reflux when I'm more to the larger side and eat crap those are my main symptoms, pooping usually twice a day, no sharp pains,  just as said, anyone else the same or think it's something else? ",1,1757160659.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

They are promoting a pretty large Honda meet in west central Ohio. I sadly won’t have my CR-Z ready in time as it’s being painted. I watched a lot of their reposts and promotional content that feature other Honda owners and not once have I seen a CR-Z in any of it. 

For context I’m seeing first gen Insights, Del Sol’s, Preludes, an S660 (I think), NSX’s, CR-V’s, Elements, and even a couple of Ridgelines. But not a single CR-Z.

I get it that there is a CR-Z meet up and drive at Tail of the Dragon the same weekend, but I know not everyone can or wants to make the trip down south.

I really wish I could’ve been able to make it tomorrow but my car is in for paint and bodywork.

Coffee in hand, cavoodle at my feet, and usually up for a good chat in the evenings.

Discord preferred. I'm bored,  and feeling a bit neglected by my usual chat partners.  So I'm looking to switch it up with some new contacts - for an hour or so now (it's late),  but future chats too if you catch my interest.  

A little about me:
- Deeply creative - I weave story, myth, and memory into everything, from fanfiction to prayers to funding applications for clients. 
- Grounded yet mystical - I move easily between practical life (work, tech, family) and my mythic, spiritual world of animism,  ancestral veneration,  Catholic conjure, and old gods. 
- Big-hearted - I value presence, honesty, and connection, and I give a lot of care to the people in my life. 
- Witty & sarcastic -  I cope and connect with cheeky, dry humor. 
- Resilient -  I juggle work, family, partners, my spiritual path and creative projects, even when it’s heavy, and still manage to keep my spark.

Hobbies: Cooking, Creative writing,  Road trips, Reading, Live gigs, Brunch, Hot tubs/Springs, massage  and every day comforts like game shows, coffee,  memes and collecting sexy accents. 

Send me a chat request with your age, location, and a little about you. And since I’m a sucker for a voice or accent I can lean into... a Vocaroo will win you points. 

Answers to FAQ's: Yes I'll chat to any age,  just bring a little more game than ""wyd, hmu"" and ""I'm really into older women"", it'll take a bit more than that to catch my attention.  SFW chats mixed with a bit of flirty banter is fine,  but ffs if you're just looking for me to entertain you without putting in any effort yourself,   keep on moving.

Guilty that I can just sit here, I don’t need to worry about whether we had plans or need to do something my time is now all my own after 24yrs.

I can take the time to breathe, cry, just be but at the same time I am sad as he’s not here asking if I need another coffee, checking if there is anything else I want.

I feel guilty that I no longer need to compromise on the big things as he’s not here to have a say but also sad that I no longer need to ask his opinion and that everything from here on out is going to be that way

I feel guilty that in some ways life is easier and somehow I am getting through the days but then in lots of others it’s oh so much more difficult and I wish he was here to give me a hug, a cheeky smile or just share a silly video he found.

I feel guilty for even trying to move forward with my life, knowing he is no longer beside me. 

I feel guilty for removing my rings and placing them on the chain next to his on a little holder I have, but I had to take them off as I kept fidgeting with them and making my skin red raw, and I was so afraid to lose them everytime I needed to remove to try to heal my fingers.

I feel guilty for trying hard to look after me, to make sure I stick around for everything we loved even though I know he would tell me to not be so silly and it’s important to look after myself.

I feel guilty for so many things and every single one I know he would be telling me to shut the f*** up and stop being silly that there is nothing to be guilty about - I so wish he was here to say this to me still, to hold me tight and say we will get through this, but life chose another path for us both.

So I will sit here remembering all the years we had together, all the things we went through and all the love we shared and that he wouldn’t want me to feel guilty for trying to move forward as best I can.

So far the pucks are mostly formed but soggy. At the start of the pour its not as dark on expresso- caps and coffee. I have only run about 20 coffees through it so far. There seems to be plenty of strength in the coffee and it tastes great!

Ab Sheela bhabhi ki bra apni jageh par thi, sirf uske boobs aage se bahar latak rahe the, jinko mai apne left hand me le kar khel raha tha, daba raha tha, aur masal raha tha. Mera right hand Sheela bhabhi ke badan se sarakte hue uski hot pink color ki underwear me jaa pahucha. Lonaval ke is plan ki plan ki hum dono ne tab se tayyari ki thi jab se Chandu ko China bhejne ka maine plan banaya tha, isi plan ki tayyari me Sheela bhabhi ne apni chut ko tayyar kar ke rakha tha. Clean shaven, ek bhi baal nahi, Sheela bhabhi ki chut vanilla ice-cream ki taran soft aur smooth feel ho rahi thi. Uski underwear me apna right hand daal ke maine uski chut ke daane ko ragadna shuru kiya. Ab maine uski dono taango ko faila kar apni taango ke sath lock kar liya tha, uski chut ke daane ko mai majboot ragar raha tha, aur uppar uski dono nipples ko pinch kiye jaa raha tha. Wo pleasure se bhar gayi thi, uske muh se pleasure wali aawaze rukne ka naam nahi le rahi thi. Uuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh............ aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh........ aaaahhhhhhh......... aisi aawaze ab sadak tak jaa rahi thi, mai to chaahta tha ki wo aur zor zor se chillaye, isliye ab maine uski right taang ko sliding window ke upar utha kar rakh diya, uski underwear ko uski gaand ki ek side me sarka kar rakh diya, aur mai khud niche zamin par apne ghuno ke bal par baith kar uski chut ko apni tongue se chodne laga. Maine apni tongue se hi uske pussy lips ko side me kar ke uske daane pe attack kiya. Ab mai uski chut ke daane ko chaat bhi raha tha aur apne lips se unpe bites bhi de raha tha, mere aisa karne se wo meri diwani ho gayi thi. “Aaaahhhhhhhh Raaj bhai, Raaj bhai, Raaj bhai, Aaaahhhhhhhh Aaaahhhhhhhh” yehi repeat kiye jaa rahi thi wo ab. Fir maine Sheela bhabhi ki chut me apni tongue daali, aur uske andar ke g-spot ko apni tongue se ragadne laga. Saath hi maine apne lips ko uske pussy lips pe kuch aise laga ke rakhe ke uski chut ka daana bhi ab meri upper lip ke niche tha. Mai uski rasili chut ko litreally kha raha tha. Sheela bhabhi ki chut kamaal ki taste karti hai, thodi khatti aur thodi mithi, kuch aisa maza hai uski chut chaatne me ke mere muh se paani nikalna kabhi rukta hi nahi. Mai jitna uski chut chaat ta hu utna mere muh se laal tapakti hui uski chut pe behti rehti hai. Sheela bhabhi bhi mera accha sath deti hai, uski chut jitni bhi chaato chik ki aur cum ki koi kami nahi hoti, cream hi cream behta rehta hai uski chut se. Uppar khade ho kar wo ""aaaahhhhhhhh, uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, aaaahhhhhhhh, uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, aaaahhhhhhhh, uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" ke jor daar expressions de rahi thi, is waqt niche agar uska pati Chandu khada hota to wo samaj jata ke uski biwi khidki pe khade ho kar apni chut ko chudwa rahi hai. Par wo to ghar pe tha hi nahi, is liye Sheela bhabhi ke sex ka nasha besharmi se saari hade paar kar chuka tha. Ab wo sirf aur sirf mera lund chaahti thi bas. Magar mai uski pornstar ki qualities ki test lene ke mood me tha.

Sheela bahbhi apni chut se kaafi kaafi jhad chuki thi, uski chut ke aas paas cum aur creeam faila hua tha, usne mere muh pe apna cream jhad diya tha. Mai apni position se utha aur sofa par jaa kar baith gaya, wo palat ke mujhe dekhne lagi, maine apni ungli se usko mere paas ane ke liye ishara kiya, wo saamne ayi, fir maine apni ungli se apne lund ki aur ishara kiya. Fir wo apne dono ghutno par baithi aur apne dono haatho se mere lund ke saath khelte hue usko apne muh me le ke chusne lagi. Tabhi maine uske gaalo par jor daar pyaar bhara chaata lagaya aur bola ""meri Sheela bhabhi jaan, tere dono haath picke rakh aur lock kar le, bilkul aage nahi aane chahiye wo”. Is wakt uske boobs uski bra ke bahar latak rahe the, underwear ek side me saraki hui thi, nipple laal aur tight the, chut gili thi. Fir maine apne lund ki taraf ishara karte hue usko bola “ye le meri Sheela bhabhi, ye tera favorite flavour hai na, kha abhi isko pet bhar ke”. Usne badi smile dete hue pehle apni tongue baahar nikali aur mere lund ko gotiyo se lekar top tak chaata, apni thuk se usko pura gila kiya, aur fir apne gile garam muh ke andar liya. Mere muh se ""aaaahhhhh"" nikal gayi. Sheela bhabhi lund chusne me maahir hai, is kala ki koi training nahi hoti magar Sheela bhabhi ke paas iska master’s certificate hai, aur wo acchi acchi pornstar ko dhul chata sakti hai. Saali mere lund ko yu chusti hai aur yu khaati hai mano jaise rabadi wali rasili kulfi kha rahi ho. Uske lund chusne ke dauraan aisa ek paal bhi nahi hota hai jab mera lund tip se le kar bottom tak gila aur thuk se bhara na ho, uske muh ki thuk mere lund se latakti rehti hai, aur wo usi thuk ko dubara chaat kar apne lips aur muh pe faila kar mere lund par ragadti hai. Sheela bhabhi ka muh mano jaise koi garam tapti hui bhatti ho, jisme wo mera loha leti hai aur usko aur tagadaa bana deti hai. Fir usko apne muh ki bhatti se bahar nikal kar uspe apni thuk maar kar thanda karti hai. Har thodi thodi der ke baad wo mere lund ke tip pe dhaar lagana nahi bhulti. Iske liye wo mere lund ki tip ko apne lips me pakadti hai, usko acche se chusti hai jaise lollipop chus rahi ho. Apni tongue se mere lund ki tip ke saath khelti hai lick karti hai, kabhi left to right aur right to left, kabhi uppar se niche aur niche se uppar. Aur fir mere lund ki tip ke hole pe apni tongue laga ke usko bohot uksaati hai, saali aisa karke muje bohot dard deti hai, mitha wala, aisa karke mera thoda bohot paani jarur nikal leti hai Sheela bhabhi. Saali ne mere muh se pleasure waali boli bulwa daali, mere muh se nikala “aahhhhh Sheela bhabhi jaan, bada mazaaaa aa gaya jaan, kamaal ka chusti hai tu. Tere saath yehi mazaa lene ke liye to maine itna kharcha kiya hai.” 

10:30 baj chuke the. Mera phone ring hua, saamne table par hi pada hua tha. Chandu call kar raha tha. Maine phone uthaya aur speaker phone ON kiya, saamne se Chandu bola ""hello Raaaj bhai, mai airport pohoch gaya"". Raat ka time tha, airport ki tafar jane wala traffic kam tha, Chandu jaldi pohoch gaya tha. Yaha Sheela bhabhi zamin par baith kar mere lund ka dinner kar rahi thi, aur baaju me sofa par rakhe hue mere iPhone pe uska pati Chandu mujse baate kar raha tha. Meri pornstar Sheela bhabhi ki lund ki chusaai ka aisa pleasure muje mil raha tha ke mere muh se words skip ho rahe the, meri saanse fuli hui thi, mai baat nahi kar paa raha tha, fir bhi maine bola ""Accha hua jaldi pohoch gaya tu, ab check-in karne ke baad airport pe kuch kha le aur coffee woffee le le."" 

Chandu: Okay Raaj bhai. Aur aapki nikalne ki tayyari ho gayi kya?

Mai: Nahi re, abhi to hum logo ko bohot bhookh lag rahi thi to hum kuch kha rahe hai. 

Chandu: Oh accha, kya banaya hai Sheela ne? Kaha hai wo? 

Mai: Kuch banaya nahi, jo available hai hamare paas wohi kha rahe hai. Aur teri biwi yahi hai mere saamne baith kar kela kha rahi hai. Ye le baat kar. 

Chandu: Hi Sheela, Śuṁ tamē kō'ī khōrāka rāndhyō nathī? (didn't you cook any food?). Śuṁ tamē mārā mitranē ā prakāranī sāravāra āpī rahyā chō? (is this the kind of treatment you're giving to my friend?). 

Sheela bhabhi \*mere lund ko chuste chuste boli\*: Mēṁ tēnē khāvā māṭē tājā mākhaṇa āpyō (I gave him fresh butter to eat). Tēṇē mārā tājā phaḷa khādhā (He also ate my fresh fruits). 

Mai: Wo mujhe jo chahiye wo de rahi hai, aur usko mujse jo chahiye wo bhi le rahi hai. Tu tension mat le, abhi tu gaya na, to teri biwi mera accha khayaal rakhegi. Chal tu flight me bithne ke baad phone kar. 

Chandu: Okay Raaj bhai, agar aapko kuch kami ho to Sheela ko boliye, aapka pura hak hai uspe. 

Aur humne phone disconnect kar diya. Maine bola ""dekha Sheela bhabhi jaan, tera pati bolta hai ke mera tere pe pura hak hai"".

Sheela bhabhi \*josh me mera lund chuste hue\*: Aap hi ka to hak hai Raaj bhai. Aapke liye hi to mai yaha apne ghutno pe baith ke itni mehnat kar rahi hu. Mera pati to muje shaadi ke baad kabhi kahi ghumane bhi nahi le gaya. Aaj mai aapke saath hafte bhar ke liye mere pehle honeymoon trip pe jaa rahi hu. 

Mai: Sahi mazaa ayega. Tere pati ko bahar bhej ke hum dono honeymoon pe jaa rahe hai, ye to tera official honeymoon ban gaya, kya bolti hai?

Ye sun ke wo zamin se uth kar khadi hui, mere pairo ke aaju baaju apne pair daal kar sofa pe chad gayi. Apne left hand se apni underwear ko chut ke uppar se side me khich ke hataya, apne right hand pe apne muh se thuk nikal kar usne apni chut pe lagayi, aur fir aa kar mere lund par baith kar apni chut ko chudwane lagi. Fir wo boli ""official honeymoon banaiye na Raaj bhai, please. Muje bhi accha lagega agar aap muj par apna pura hak jataye, aap muje mere naam se bulaye."" Aisa bola kar usne sharma ke apna sir mere shoulders pe daala, apne dono haath mere piche sofa pe rakh kar mere lund ki jordaar sawaari karne lagi. Main bhi uski gaand ko apne dono haatho me pakad kar usko uchaal ne laga, aur maine bola ""aah Sheela.... Sheela meri jaan, Lonavala ki is puri trip pe hoga hamara official honeymoon. Jam kar chudayi karenge is honeymoon par, tuje tere pati ki yaad bilkul aane nahi dunga mai"". Aur mai Sheela bhabhi ki gaand utha utha kar apne lund pe patakne laga, uski tight chut ki chudaai ka mazza muje paagal kar raha tha. Oohhhhh…… kya badhiya tight chut hai meri darling Sheela bhabhi ki, mai explain nahi kar paunga. 

Sheela bhabhi: Raaj bhai, mai kaafi time se aapse karwa rahi hu, magar ye wala experience hi kuch aur hone wala hai. 

Mai: Ha Sheela jaan sahi bola tune, ye tera mera official honeymoon jo hai. 

Sheela bhabhi: Aahhhh Raaj bhai, kya kamaal ka mazaa dete hai aap, pagal ho jaati hu mai. Agle pure hafte tak mai aapki hu. Aap jo chaahe wo karo, jaise chaahe waise karo, aur jaha chaahe waha karo Raaj bhaaaai.

Tabhi waha asofa par pada hua Sheela ka phone ring hua, uska pati Chandu phone kar raha tha. Sheela mere lund ki sawari me kaafi busy thi, wo uski pleasure se bhari hui moment thi, wo mere lund pe jhad rahi thi, aur tab wo koi bhi disturbance lena nahi chahti thi. Sheela ne apne phone ki taraf mud kar bhi nahi dekha, usne mere lund pe apni riding chalu rakhi. Maine Sheela ka phone answer kiya (speaker phone ON kar ke), ""Chandu, mai bol raha hu"".

Chandu: Are Raaj bhai aapne phone answer kiya. 

Mai: Ha kyu ki teri biwi yaha baith ke kuch kar rahi hai,busy hai, aur wo abhi disturb nahi hona chahti hai.......... Kyu be? Maine phone answer kiya to tuje koi taklif ho gayi kya? 

Chandu: Nahi Raaj bhai aisa kuch nahi hai. Wo to mai Sheela ko akele chod ke jaa raha hu isliye usko puchna chahta tha ke usko mujpe gussa to nahi hai! 

Mai (Sheela ki gaand ko apne dono hatho se masal ke apne lund pe utha ke patak raha tha): Abhi agar teri biwi gussa hogi to tu kya trip pe nahi jayega? Bh##we, teri trip pe laakho kharch kiye hai maine mad#####d. Apni biwi se jara baat kar ke dekh, wo to chaahti hai ke tu jaldi se apni trip pe nikal jaaye, taa ki wo mere saath full enjoy kar paye. 

Meri ye baat sunte hi Sheela ne apna sir mere kandhe se uthaya aur meri taraf dekhne lagi, maine bhi uski chut ko thokte thokte naughty nazar se dekha. Usne turant mere sir ko apne haatho me pakad ke muje pagalo ki tarah kiss karne lagi. Ab wo mujse apni chut bhi thukwa rahi thi aur muje passionately kiss bhi kar rahi thi. Kiss karte hue maine Sheela ki bra utaar kar living room ke kisi kone me phenk di. Tabhi..........

Chandu (phone se, confused): Kya?? Wo kya chaahti hai?? Mai kuch samjha nahi Raaj bhai!! 

Yaha sofa par baith kar Chandu ki biwi mere saath honeymoon se pehle hone wali suhaag raat mana rahi thi, Sheela bhabhi aur muje dono ko Chandu ko kuch bhi samjha ne me koi interest nahi tha, wo hum dono ki pleasure wali moment thi. Magar ye Chandu bh##wa apni biwi ke muh se hi sun na chahta tha ke kaise wo mere saath agle pure hafte chudwane wale thi. Is liye wo fir se bola: ""Hello, Raaj bhai? Sheela? Śuṁ tamē manē sāmbhaḷī śakō chō (can you hear me)?""

Tabhi Sheela ne pasine se bhiga hua apna nanga badan mere chaati se chipkaya, mere lund pe apni chut ki sawari ko chaalu rakha aur apne pati ko jawaab diya: ""Hā, amē tamanē sāmbhaḷī śakī'ē chī'ē, jhaḍapathī vāta karī'ē (yes we can hear you, talk quickly)."" Sheela ne itna bola aur maine uske dono ghutno ke niche apne dono haath daale, uski chut me apna lund gusa ke usi position me usko utha ke mai khada ho gaya. Sheela ne bhi uthne se pehle mera aur khud ka phone apne hatho me utha liye aur mere gale se lipat gayi. Khade hone ke baad maine Sheela ke ghutno ke niche se apne hatho ka istamaal karke jhatke dene laga, uski gaand ko dhakke dene laga, Sheela ki chut ko khade khade thokne laga. 

Chandu (phone pe): Huṁ āśā rākhuṁ chuṁ kē tamanē kō'ī vāndhō nathī kē huṁ tamanē ēkalā chōḍī rahyō chuṁ anē vidēśamāṁ saphara karuṁ chuṁ (I hope you don't mind that i am leaving you alone and going on a trip abroad). 

Sheela: Hhhhuuuuuu.......... aaaahhhhhhhhh......... oooohhhhhhhhhhhhh............

Chandu: Kr̥pā karīnē asvastha thaśō nahīṁ. Rājabhā'ī'ē mārā para ēṭaluṁ paisā kharcyā chē (please don't be upset. Raaj bhai has spent so much money on me). 

Sheela mujhe perfect position me mil gayi thi, khade khade uski tight chut ko chodne me muje jabardast maza aa raha tha, mera lund jwala mukhi ban gaya tha. Yaha Sheela apni chut chudwate hue mere lund par apne cum ka lawa tapaka rahi thi, fir bhi usne apne pati ko jawab diya: ""Tamē mārā viśē cintā karaśō nahīṁ. Havē huṁ tamārā śrēṣṭha mitra rājē bhā'īnā hāthamāṁ chuṁ anē tē pōtānā mitranī patnīnē khuśa anē santuṣṭa rākhavā māṭē ēka uttama kāma karī rahyō chē (you please don't worry about me anymore. now I'm in your best friend Raaj bhai's hands, and he's doing a fantastic job to keep his friend's wife happy and satisfied)."" 

Chandu: Manē khuśī thāya chē kē mārō mitra mārī patnīnī sārī sambhāḷa lē chē. Anē Sheelaa, mārā mitra rājēbhā'īnē khuśa anē santuṣṭa rākhavānī javābadārī paṇa tamārī chē (I am very happy to hear that my friend is taking good care of my wife. And Sheela it is your responsibility also to keep my friend Raaj bhai happy and satisfied). 

Mai (usi position me bedroom ki taraf chalte chalte): Abe Chandu, jabse tu ghar se nikala hai tab se teri biwi mera bohot khayal rakh rahi hai. Usko mera khayal rakhne ke liye batana nahi padta kabhi, mauka milte hi wo meri sewa me lag jaati hai. Tere dost ka itna pyaar se khayaal rakhne wali biwi mili hai tuje, bohot hi nasib wala pati hai tu. 

Itna bolke maine Sheela ko apni godi se utara aur pith ke bal pe usko bed pe letaya. Fir mai apne ghutno par baitha, uski underwear ko uske badan se alag kar ke bedroom ke kisi kone me phenk diya, aur uski chut pe do baar apne muh se thuk maari, aur fir khade hoke apne khade lund ko haath me pakad ke mai apni thuk ko uski chut me ragad ne laga. 

Chandu: Sahi hai, sun ne se accha laga, lagta hai mai aaram se apni trip pe jaa paunga. 

Maine Sheela ki chut me fir apna lund ghusa ke, uske nange badan pe let gaya, usko tight hug kar liya, aur usi position me uski chut ko thokne laga, aur fir maine bola ""Chandu, apne kaam pe dhyaan de. Tu itna bekaar hai is liye teri biwi tujse khush nahi hai, isi liye muje yaha aana padta hai teri biwi ko khush karne ke liye. Abhi tu aaram se jaa, thik hai.""

Chandu: Okay Raaj bhai, aap dekhna kitna accha kaam kar ke ata hu mai china se. Chalo bye, aap log enjoy kijiye. 

https://preview.redd.it/3fq42t1aajnf1.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=7334ddbad77c91028ef763d4a5918f864206d86b

Maine phone kaat diya. Ab mai Sheela ki chut ko joro shoro se thok raha tha. Wo bhi chilla chilla ke mujse apni chut chudwa rahi thi. Mai uske badan se utha, uske dono pairo ko hawa me utha kar apne hatho me pakad liye aur fir uski chut ko jyaadaa speed me chodne laga. Sheela control ke bahar ho chuki thi, ek professional pornstar ki tarah mujse apni chut thukwa rahi thi, chikh rahi thi, chilla rahi thi, uski chikhe itni jordaar thi ki uske pados ki khidkiyo tak jaroor pohoch rahi hongi, hume koi farak nahi pad raha tha, Sheela aaj apni suhaag raat jo mana rahi thi. Sheela apni kamar ko jhatke de kar utha utha kar mujse chudwa rahi thi. Mere shot ki rhythm se apni kamar ke jhatko ko match kar ke chudwa rahi thi. Muje feel ho raha tha ke wo apni chut me bohot jhad rahi hai, mera lund uski chut cream se fully cover ho chuka tha. Maine apni thukayi jaari rakhi, aur steadily mai apni speed aur fast kar raha tha. Pura bedroom sirf meri gotiya Sheela ki gaand se takrane ki aawaz se, aur Sheela ki chikho ki aawaaz se bhar chuka tha. Sheela ne apne dono hatho ko apne badan ke side me faila kar bedsheet ko tight pakad kar pleasure ke maare use khich rahi thi. Ab maine Sheela ki taango se apne haath chod diye, Sheela ki knees ke niche uski thighs ko apne dono hatho se tight hug kar ke uski gaand ko bed ki edge tak khich liya. Ab mai usi position me apne knees ko thoda sa bend karke Sheela ki chut ko aur jor se chodne laga. Mera lund ab bohot hi tight ho gaya tha, Sheela ki tight chut se ragad ke mere lund se ab angaare nikal rahe the. Ye time tha ke mai Sheela ki chut me apna lund nichod kar usko apna ras nikal kar pilau. 

Mai: Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh.......... Sheela jaaaann............ mai jhadne wala hu jaaaaaaaannnnn.

Sheela: Thik hai Raaaaaaj bhaaaai....... pila do apni jaan ko apna pura ras. 

Mai: Oohhhhhhhhh........ Daal du kya andar hi????

Sheela: Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh....... Raaaajj bhaaaaii........ maine aapko pehle bhi kabhi nahi roka. Aur aaj to hamari official suhaag raat hai. Aur suhaag raat ko aap ko apne ras ka har ek boond mere andar daalna hota hai. 

Mai: Accha........ tere andar matlab? kaha meri raani? 

Sheela (haste hue): Aap bhi na Raaj bhai. Mere andar........ daal do. 

Mai (haste hue): Andar kaha.......... bataa naa......... muje samaj me nahi aa raha hai.................

Sheela (apni aankho ko band kar ke): aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh........... Raaaajj bhaaaaaii......... meri pyaasi chutttt me......... daaaall doo naaaa........ 

Tabhi maine aur tez chudaai shuru ki aur jhatke se Sheela ki tight aur pyaasi chut me apna paani chodna shuru kiya. Jitni bhi baar Sheela ne muje apni chut di hai, maine uske andar itne jhatke de de ke paani choda hai ke wo hamesh overflow ho gayi hai. Abhi maine aur 4 - 5 baar jor daar jhatke maare aur uski chut ko apna ras pila ke uski pyaas bujhayi. Sheela ki aankhe tight band thi, wo feel kar paa rahi thi jab mai uski chut me jhad raha tha. Fir usne apne apni aankhe kholi aur muje dekh kar sukun wali smile dene lagi. Wo thi complete satisfaction ki sign. Fir maine dheere dheere Sheela ki chut se apne lund ko bahar nikala, aur mai wahi se bed par chadaa aur pillow pe sir rakh kar let gaya. Bohot hi thak gaya tha mai is shaadi shudaa Gujrati chut ki chudaai se. Sheela bhi usi position me sarak kar mere bagal me ayi aur mere right hand pe apna sir rakh kar leti. Hum ek dusre ki aankho me hawas ki nazaro se dekh ne lage. Hamare pasine se bhige hue badan ek dusre se chipak rahe the, uski chut se bahar nikal kar behta hua cum cream muje apni thighs par feel ho raha tha. Maine Sheela ke boobs ko pyaar se apne haatho me liya, nipples ko jara sa pinch kiya. Sheela ne mere lund ko apne hath me le kar pyaar se ragada. Fir hum dono ne lip lock kiye, hum ek dusre ki tongues ko chaat rahe the, muh me se saliva exchange kar rahe the. Bedroom me ab silence tha, aur sirf lust bhar gaya tha, hum dono ka pet chudayi se bhar gaya tha, magar shayad man abhi tak bhara nahi tha. Raat ke 12:25 baj chuke the. Hamara lust kafi asar kar raha tha, Sheela ki kissing aur uske nange badan ki garmi ne mera lund fir se tight khada kar diya tha. Tabhi mera phone baja. Chandu ka call tha, maine speaker phone pe answer kiya. 

Mai: Ha bol be.

Chandu: Raaj bhai, mai bol raha hu. Thodi der me shayad flight take-off karne wali hai, phone band karne ko bola hai air-hostess ne, to socha aap logo ko bye bol deta hu.

Mai: Okay bye, phone karte rehna. Matrix ka international SIM le liya na tune airport se?

Yaha mai Chandu se phone pe baate kar raha hu, aur utni der me chudaai ki bhookhi pyaasi uski biwi Sheela ne niche ki taraf sarak kar mere lund pe hamla kar diya tha. Wo mere lund ko lolly-pop ki tarah chus aur kha rahi thi. Sheela jab mere lund ko chusti hai to mere sare badan me current laga daalti hai. Uske garma garam muh me aur gili tongue me kuch alag hi jaadu hai, mera badan excitement se jhate khane lagta hai. 

Chandu: Ha Raaj bhai international SIM le liya hai maine, call karunga. Aur aap log Lonavala ke liye nikale kya?

Mai: Nahi be, abhi nahi. Mere consultant ka call aya tha, wo kal late ane wala hai. Is liye teri biwi ne bola Raaj bhai aaj raat aap hamare ghar pe hi so jaao mere saath. Hum log kal subeh nikalenge Lonavala ke liye. 

Chandu: Okay thik hai. Sheela kaha hai. 

Mai: Wo abhi baat nahi kar payegi, wo kela khaa rahi hai, uska muh pura kele se bhara hua hai. Ye le ke tu hi baat kar le.

Aur maine phone ko niche Sheela ki taraf sarkaya, Sheela mera lund chuste hue meri taraf dekhne lagi, aur naughty smile de kar mere lund ko aur jor jor se chusne wale jhatke dene lagi. Mera badan uske lund chusne se jhatke kha raha tha. 

Chandu: Sheelaa, havē mārī phlā'iṭa bandha tha'ī jaśē. Jyārē huṁ pāchō āvīśa tyārē huṁ tamanē jō'īśa (Sheela, my flight is going to take off now. I'll see you when I return). 

Sheela (mere lund ko chuste hue): Hmm................................. Hmm......................................

Chandu: Kāḷajī rākhajō (take care). Bye. 

Maine Sheela ka sir ki choti pakad kar usko apne lund pe aur jor se push kiya aur apna pura lund Sheela ke muh me ghused diya, maine bola ""Bye Chandu"". Aur fir maine phone kaat diya. Fir maine Sheela ko apni taraf khincha, uske nange badan ko apne badan ke paas chipkaya, uske hotho pe bohot sare kisse kiye, fir maine bola ""tu jam kar chudwane wali hai na mujse hafte bhar meri raani?"".

Sheela: Mera official honeymoon hai, mai to khub maze karne waali hu. Aapka kya iraadaa hai ji?

Mai: Ab dusre ki biwi ke saath honeymoon manane ko mile ko kaun maze nahi karega meri jaan. Wo bhi tere jaisi tight chut wali, lund ki pyaasi shaadi shuda aurat jab mujse apni chut chudwana chahe to maza hi aa jayega. Hamara ye official honemoon tuje apni shaadi se jyaada yaad rahega meri Sheela jaan.

Aisa bol ke maine Sheela ko fir se tight hug kiya aur hum khoob smooching karne lage. 

Friends, this was one part of Sheela bhabhi and my official honeymoon. Let me know how you like my story. Other parts of our official honeymoon, and all the excitement at Lonavala is coming soon, stay tuned. ",2,1757159925.0,Desi_Kahaniya,0,1.0,False

Welcome back to my collection of real stories. 

My name is Raaj Malhotra, mai Bombay se hu. I am a handsome young man with a fair complexion, good physique, and very confident body language. Mai bohot hi paise wala hu, mere khud ke kai sare businesses hai jiska huge turnover hai.

Is kahani me mera purana dost Chandu Dhinka, uski jawaan biwi Sheela aur mai hu. Chandu se meri jaan pehchaan 2 saal purani hai jab mai Mumbai ke Malad area ki locality me ek building me rehta tha aur wo bhi usi building me rehta tha, hum dono akele rehte the apne flats me. Ab mai South Bombay move kar chuka hu ek skyscrapper me apne naye duplex apartment me. Is Gujrati couple Chandu aur Sheela ki shaadi 2 mahine pehle hi hui hai, maine kafi kharcha kiya un dono ki shaadi pe. Chandu muje apna sabkuch maantaa hai aur mere word ke aage kuch kehne ki himmat nahi rakhta. Bechara jobless hai aur apna ghar sasuraal ke thode bohot paise pe chala raha hai (aur mere paise to bohot lag rahe hai). Itni buri halat me sharaab pine ka auska shauk ab uski buri aadat aur lat ban gayi hai, aur meri ye responsibility hai ki Sheela bhabhi jaisi jawaani ke saath uski shaadi hone ke baad mai mere dost ka ye daaru peene ka shauk pura bhi karu.

Meri darling Sheela bhabhi ke baare me bataya jaye to ye story kafi lambi ho jayegi. Sheela bhabhi 24 saal ki ekdam jawaan, kamsin, naughty, sexy, hot hai. Uski skin dekho to bolo ke kacche aam ki tarah hai jo ekdam fresh ho aur khatta mitha ho. Figure 34 ke boobs, 26 ki kamar aur 36 ki waist, puri tarah se bhara hua badan, height 5 feet 6 inches, badi aankhe, lambe baal, fair complexion and an eye catching figure. Rapper Baadshah ke words me kahe to: jaha se honi chahiye wahi se hai wo thick. Sheela bhabhi aish, aaram, naye kapde, naye gadgets, aur dher saare paise ki shaukeen hai. In sabse bhi jyada bhukh rakhti hai wo bohot sare sex ki. Shaadi ke 1 mahine me hi mere pas usko puri tarah se fulfill karne ki capacity hai ye dekhke usne muje pata liya tha. Ab baat aisi thi ki uska pati Chandu tha aur uske pati wale sare pleasures muje mil rahe the, wo bhi uske khud ke ghar me uske apne bedroom me, batata hu kaise. 

https://preview.redd.it/2c3ztxk79jnf1.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=f124422a500cbba9ae13f25d07d6b984c3ad3538

Ek din mai Chandu ke ghar baitha tha, maahol kafi thanda tha. Sheela bhabhi darling kitchen me mere liye meri special coffee bana rahi thi. Yaha living room me mai aur Chandu baith ke kaafi serious baate kar rahe the. 

Mai: Are bhai, tera kaapde aur fabrics me expertise hai to usi line to aur thoda explore karke kuch shuru kar na. 

Chandu: Haa raaj bhai,  Tiruppur me jaa ke kuch dekh sakta hu, magar wo karne ke liye thoda kharcha hai. Aur uske baad shuruwat ka setup karne ka decide kiya to bhi finance lagega. Usi ke bare me soch ke confuse ho gaya hu ke wo sab mai arrange nahi kar paunga. 

Mai: Baas, ye hi baat, abe chu#### south me kyu jaa raha hai. China jaa ke kar jo explore karne ka hai. Mai kharcha deta hua tera. 

Chandu \*uski aankhe khuli ki khuli reh gayi\*: Raaj bhai, China se best market kahi nahi hoga. Magar muje apke upar aur boj nahi daalna hai. 

Mai: Abe jaa be, mera boj mai teri biwi pe halka kar daalunga. Tu tension kyu leta hai. Bol kya bolta hai? 

Tabhi mera boj halka karne wali meri Sheela bhabhi darling living room me ayi aur mere haath me mera coffe mug deke boli ""Raaj bhai, pehle aapki coffee lijiye, fir jo boj halka karna hai wo kariye"". Aur mai meri coffee le ke sip karne laga.

Chandu: Hmm.... Raaj bhai.... Thank yo...........

Mai: Sheela bhabhi shakkar thodi aur chahiye, chal....

Aur mai kitchen ki aur gaya, wo bhi mere piche aayi. Kitchen me ghuste hi, maine mera coffee mug counter pe rakha, palat ke Sheela bhabhi ko pakad ke ghumaya aur counter ke aage laga ke khada kiya aur usko smooch karne laga. Bohot hi hot aur sexy lag rahi thi wo. Patli shiffon ki aqua color ki saree, us par royal blue color ka deep neck aur almost backless blouse, andar black bra, aur hothon par strawberry flavor ki lipstick laga ke mujpar qayamat dha rahi thi wo. Mera lund tight khada ho ke uski saree ke upar se hi uski chut ko thoke jaa raha tha, upar mai uske lips ke uppar se sari strawberry ko chaat chaat ke saaf kar raha tha. Mai apne dono haatho se uske boobs ke saath khel raha tha, unko pinch aur press kar raha tha. 

Sheela bhabhi: Raaaaj bhaaii, kya kar rahe ho? Mera pati baahar baitha hai.

Mai: Meri jaanu Sheela bhabhi, kabhi aisa hua hai ke tere pati ne andar aake kuch check kiya hai? (fir maine jor se aawaz lagayi) Ae Chandu, baitha reh, meri coffee ko thodi mithi kar ke aa raha hu.....

Fir maine uski saree ko uski kamar tak uthaya, uski underwear me apna left hand dala, aur uski clean shaven chut ko uppar se ragadne laga. Ab Sheela bhabhi ki ye haalat thi ki agar mai usko usi counter top pe chudwane ke liye bolta to wo mere liye apne pair faila kar baith jaati. Par muje to usko sirf garam karna tha. Kabhi kabhi mai usko sirf ungali karke waise hi pyaasi chod deta hu. Aisa karne se uski lund ki bhookh control ke baahar ho jaati hai, pati daaaru ke nashe me kuch kar nahi pata hai to wo mere liye din raat tadapti rehti hai, aur uske baad wali chudaai me wo muje full satisfaction deti hai. Ab maine uske baaalo ki choti ko apne right hand me pakada tha, uski chut ko apne left hand se ragadte jaa raha tha, aur uppar apne lips se uske lips ko lock kar ke rakha tha taa ke wo shoor nahi macha paye. Sheela bhabhi apni kamar ko mere haath ki rhythm ke saath hila rahi thi, apni chut ko khud hi ragadwa rahi thi mere hath se. Muje mere haatho pe accha khaasaa gilapan aur cream feel ho raha tha, uske haatho ki mere upar ki grip tight hote hue feel ho rahi thi. Maine turant uske badan ko jhatak kar apne se dur kiya, uski underwear se apna haath bahar khich liya. Wo muje bhukhi nazaro se dekhte reh gayi, aur mai mera coffee mug utha kar kitchen ke bahar living room me aa kar Chandu ke saamne sofa par baith gaya.

Mai: Hmm.... Nice coffee.... Are Sheela bhabhi.... kaha reh gayi? Aa ja yaha baith hamare saath. Aur Chandu kya bolha hai bol na.... China jayega tu? Mere contacts hai waha, tera arrangement ho jayega. 

Sheela bhahi kitchen se bahar ayi living room me, aate aate bhi wo apne kapde thik karte hue hi aa rahi thi, kitchen me uski haalat kharab jo ki thi maine. Wo jaa kar living room me rakhi plastic chair par baithi. 

Mai: Are tu waha itni dur kyu jaa ke baithi? Yaha aa ke baith (maine usko apne baaju me baithneka ishara kiya) Yaha bohot important discussion chaalu hai. 

Wo wahi se baith kar muje bade gusse se dekh rahi thi, uski chut ko jhadne nahi diya tha na maine, uski chut ka paani nikalne se pehle hi maine apna haath hata liya tha uski chut se. Fuga hua muh le kar wo waha se uthi aur sofa par mere baju me aa kar baith gayi. Chandu saamne ke sofa ke single seat par baitha tha aur mai turn karke Sheela bhabhi ki taraf apni body ghuma ke uske saath double seater sofa pe baitha tha. Maine wahi par Sheela bhabhi ki pith aur kamar par apna left haath ghumana shuru kiya, aur right hand se apni coffee sip kar raha tha. 

Mai: Tere pati ka jo fabrics aur kapda market ka interest hai uske liye mai usko China bhej raha hu, tera kya khayaal hai?

Sheela bhabhi \*gusse me\*: Kuch to kaam kare ye. Muje to bohot chinta hoti hai. Magar aisa bhi lagta hai ki aap hamare liye kitna karenge. 

Mai: Mai jitna karunga tujse hi wasul kar lunga meri Sheela bhabhi jaan, (mai hasne laga) haha haha, kya bolta hai Chandu? haha haha. 

Chandu \*ch###ya sala, besharam, wo bhi mere saath hasne laga\*: haha haha.... sahi hai Raaj bhai (aur usne mere haath pe taali bhi maari). 

Chandu mere haatho pe taali de raha tha, aur mai apne left hand se uski biwi ki pith aur kamar ragadte jaa raha tha. Sheela bhabhi baithe baithe fir se kaafi garam ho gayi thi, apna right haath mere thigh pe rakh kar meri harkato ko encourage kar rahi thi, aur apne badan se machal rahi thi. Tab tak mai ek step aur aage badh chuka tha, ab maine Sheela bhabhi ki pith se uski bra ka hook khol diya tha, uske boobs suddenly uski blouse ke andar free feel kar rahe the aur kuch jyaada jhoolne lage the. Maine uski back aur kamar ko ragadna chaalu rakha aur apne right hand se mere phone se mere travel planner ko phone ghumaya. 

Mai: Jaangid.... mai bol raha hu.... Ek aadmi ka China return trip plan karna hai, next 1-2 din me. Haa.... muje pata hai short notice ka trip expensive hota hai, magar tujse maine pucha kya kitha cost hai? Apne Chinese representative ko personally present rehne ke liye bhi book kar le mere aadmi ke saath. Bill mere accounts ko bhej de. Mere aadmi ka number le le.... Ae Chandu tera number bol.... 96 ## ## ## ##.... Okay? Abhi phone kar is number pe.... uska naam Chandu Dhinka hai. Okay.

Maine phone disconnect kiya. Chandu ka phone bajne laga, mera travel agent tha. Unki baate shuru hui. Maine Sheela bhabhi ko kisi bahane bedroom chalne ko bola aur Chandu ko ishara kiya ke hum bedroom jaa rahe hai. Chandu ne meri taraf dekh ke haa me apni gardan hilayi, aur waha sofa par baith ke phone pe mere travel planner se baate kar raha tha, uski biwi muje apne bedroom me le jaa rahi thi. Bedroom pohoch ke maine darwaza dhakela aur usko band kiya. Apne pocket se mobile nikal ke apne travel planner ko fir se phone lagaya, wo call waiting pe tha par mera naam dekh kar usne mera call answer kiya. Maine usko bola ""Jaangid.... Chandu Dhinka ka pehle accha khasa 10-15 minutes ka telephonic interview le, uske baad hi uska travel arrange kar, nahi to mai tera bill approve nahi karunga, muje dekhna hai tera uske sath interview kaisa tha"". Ye bol ke maine phone disconnect kiya. Fir maine Sheela bhabhi ki taraf dekh ke use pucha ""Itni gusse me kyu dekh rahi thi meri bhabhi jaan?""

Sheela bhabhi \*sharma ke\*: Aap hi aisa karte hai na mere saath, itni aag laga ke nikal kyu gaye aap kitchen se?

Mai: Teri aag bujha ne ke liye hi to tere pati ko baahar interview pe bithaya hai na mari bhabhi jaan. Aa ja abhi. 

Fir maine usko bed pe letaya. Uska sir bed ki edge ki taraf rakha aur pair bed ke bich ki taraf. Fir maine meri jeans khol ke apna lund zip ke bahar khicha aur usko Sheela bhabhi ke muh me pel diya. Ab mai uske muh ko chod raha tha. Fir maine uske pairo ki taraf jhuk ke uski saree ko uski kamar tak khicha, aur uski black underwear ko khinch kar uske badan se alag kiya. Fir mai uske uppar 69 ki position me let gaya. Ab mai niche uske muh ko apne lund se chod raha tha aur Sheela bhabhi apni chut ko mere tongue se chudwa rahi thi. Kaafi garam ho gaye the hum dono aur josh me bhi aa gaye the. Aisa 10 minutes tak karte hue maine Sheela bhabhi ke muh me apne sare cum ki pichkaari maar maar ke uske muh ko full bhar diya, wo bhi apni chut se kaafi jhad chuki thi, uski chut pe aur uske aas paas meri thuk thi aur uska chip-chipa cum cream faila hua tha. Aise me mai khada hua, uske muh me apne lund se thode aur shots maare aur fir apna lund uske muh ke baahar khich liya. Apne lund ko apni underwear ke andar dhakel ne ke baad maine apne jeans ki zip band ki, aur Sheela bhabhi ki jo underwear mere haath me abhi tak maine pakad ke rakhi thi us se apne muh pe lage hue uske cum ko saaf karte hue mai bedroom ke bahar nikal pada. Living room pohoch kar mai sofa par baitha, tab Chandu ne bhi apna phone disconnect kar diya, uska mere travel agent ke sath phone pe interview ho chuka tha. Maine Sheela bhabhi ki underwear se apne face pe lage hue cum ko saaf kiya, aur neck pe aya hua pasina pochte hue pucha ""kya be ho gayi teri baat Jaangid ke sath? Kya fix hua hai?""

Chandu: Haa Raaj bhai, unhone mujse bohot inquiry ki. Par baat ho gayi. Wo parso ke liye travel plan kar rahe hai mera. 

Mai: Abe Jh##tu, foreign jana hai, Bhawnagar nahi. Inquiry to hogi na. Par tu tension mat le, tera kaam kar dega wo, mera aadmi hai.

Utne me Sheela bhabhi bedroom se living room ate hue mujhe dikhi. Nazre jhuki hui, kaafi udaas aur unsatisfied thi wo. Chupke se meri taraf dekh rahi thi, aur fir se mujse apni nazar chura rahi thi. Wo living room me ayi aur window pe jaa kar khadi hui. Actually, pehle kitchen aur abhi bedroom me humare foreplay se wo kaafi garam ho gayi thi. Bedroom ke andar to mujse apni chut ko chudwane ke liye tadap rahi thi wo. Usko lag raha tha ke ab mai bed pe chad ke uski chut ko thokna shuru kar dunga, uske liye puri tarah se tayyar thi wo, aur aise me main uski aag ko bujhaye bina waha se nikal gaya, usi baat se unsatisfied aur upset thi wo. Jaisa ke maine aapko bataya ke kabhi kabhi mai usko waise hi pyaasi chod deta hu. Fir maine usko bulaya ""Sheela bhabhi, idhar aa ke baith na mere paas. Tuje good news deni hai."" Wo window se ghum kar ayi aur sofa ke ek taraf baithi, mujse dur. Maine Chandu ki taraf dekh ke bola ""Are mujpe koi kaante lage hue hai kya? Itni acchi good news dene wala hu mai, aur ye teri biwi dekh kaise behave kar rahi hai."" 

Chandu: Sheelaa, ā kēma vartē chē? Tē sāruṁ lāgatuṁ nathī (Sheela, why are you behaving like this? It doesn't look good).

Mai: Oh meri Sheela bhabhi jaan, idhar aa ke baith na. Mujse gussa hai kya tu? Kya hua bata na?!

Fir maine apna right hand aage karke usko bola ""ye le, maine bedroom me tujse liya tha tera kapda apna pasina puchne ke liye!"" Aisa bol ke maine apne right hand ko khola aur uski underwear apne haath me latka ke usko dikhayi. Usne turant apni underwear mere haath se chin kar apne paas le li. Ye sab uske pati Chandu ke saamne ho raha tha, sirf ye sab itna fast ho raha tha ke Chandu ye samaj hi nahi paya ke maine uski biwi ne pehni hui underwear uske badan se utar kar layi thi. Fir maine Sheela bhabhi ko uske pati Chandu ke China travel ki news sunayi. Shaam ke 7:30 pm ho chuke the. Mai utha, dono ko goodbye bol kar apne ghar nikala. Sheela bhabhi muje jane ko nahi dena chahti thi, obviously Chandu bhi apne Chinese trip ki excitement me tha aur muje rukne ke liye force kar raha tha. Maine dono ko mana kiya, Sheela bhabhi ki aag ko aur bhadka ne ke liye usko is raat ke liye unsatisfied chod kar mai ghar chala gaya. Maine kaha ke mai unko kal milunga.

Dusre din 8:15 pm ke aas paas mai Chandu ke ghar pahucha. Chandu apne travel details ke sath fully updated tha, Jaangid ne usko sare details email pe bhej diye the (email ka BCC muje bhi kiya tha, isliye muje puri information thi). Chandu bedroom me apna luggage pack kar raha tha. Sheela bhabhi ka mood kuch alag hi tha. 

Mai: \*Chandu ke paas baith kar\* Bhai teri biwi kyu gusse me dikh rahi hai? Kya baat hai?

Chandu: Raaj bhai, aap hi pucho usko. Mujse jyada aapke close hai wo. Ab aap hi usko samjao. Muje bolti hai ke aap foreign jaa ke jalsaa karoge, aur mai yaha akele bore ho kar reh jau kya?

Sheela bhabhi \*hum dono ke plan ke mutabik bolne lagi\*: Sahi bol rahi hu na Raaj bhai, ab is ghar me mai akele ek hafte bhar kaise apna time bitaungi jab mera pati mere paas nahi hoga?

Mai: Ye baat to meri Sheela bhabhi jaan sahi bol rahi hai tu. Par tuje bina kaam ke agar mai China bhejne jaunga to mera kharcha bhi double ho jayega. Pata hai tere pati pe is trip ke liye mera kharcha kitna hua hai? 2.5 laakh rupaye. 

Chandu: Raaj bhaaaai, itna kharcha?

Mai: Abe ch###ye, foreign jaa raha hai na tu, ya Bhawnagar? Travel kitna mehenga hai, rehne ka kharcha, khane pine ka, saath me ek local guide ko book kiya hai tere liye. Kharcha to hai hi na.

Chandu: Haa Raaj bhai mai samajta hu. Sheela, kr̥pā karīnē ā rītē vartaśō nahīṁ. Ju'ō kē tē kēṭaluṁ kharcāḷa chē (Sheela, please don't behave like this. See how expensive it is). 

Mai: Magar...... magar...... magar.......... aaj hi subah muje mere property consultant ne muje phone kiya tha, aur mai kal subeh usko Lonavala me milne wala hu kyu ki wo muje waha 4-5 properties dikhane wala hai mera ek personal vacation house banane ke liye. Mai aaj raat ko hi Lonavala jane ke liye nikalne wala hu. Mere architect ko bhi maine waha join karne ke liye bol diya hai. Mera waha ek hafte ka kaam hai. Agar tuje koi problem nahi hai aur Sheela bhabhi chahe to wo mere sath hafte bhar ke liye Lonavala aa sakti hai. 

Chandu: Magar Raaj bhai aap apne kaam se jaa rahe ho, aapko disturbance hogi Sheela ki wajeh se. 

Mai: Maine waha Aamby Valley me luxury villa book kiya hai apne liye. Kya disturbance hogi muje. Mere villa ke private pool me enjoy karegi teri biwi. Kyu Sheela bhabhi, chalegi kya tu bol?!

Sheela bhabhi: \*sharma ke meri tafar dekhte hue\* Agar aap ko koi taklif nahi hai to mai aaungi. Yaha akele rehne se accha hai. 

Mai: Are meri Sheela bhabhi darling, tu chalegi to muje taklif kyu hogi, ulta mera bhi time pass ho jage. Pura villa book kiya hai maine 46,000 rupees per night me, tu ayegi to wo paise bhi wasool ho jayenge mere. Chal, mausam bhi mast thanda hai, hum bhi jalsaa karenge, tere pati ko jane de China.

Aise kar ke plan fix hua, ab Chandu jaa raha tha China ek hafte ke liye, aur uski biwi jaa rahi thi mere sath Lonavala, AKELE. Raat ke 9:40 pm ho gaye. Chandu ki flight bich raat 01:00 am ki thi, usko 2 ghante pehle (11 baje tak) airport pohochna tha, uska matlab usko 10:00 pm tak apne ghar Malad se nikalna tha. Kuch aur der me wo ready hua, maine uske liye Uber mangayi. Usne apni bag uthayi aur ghar se nikalne laga ""Chalo Raaj bhai, nikalta hu. Aap kab tak nikalne wale ho?""

Mai: Dekhte hai abhi, teri biwi apna saamaan pack karegi uske baad hi. 

Chandu: Thik hai Raaj bhai. Huṁ havē Sheelaa chōḍī rahyō chuṁ. Havē tamē thōḍā divasō māṭē rājē bhā'ī sāthē rahēvānā chō. Kr̥pā karīnē tēnē takalīpha āpaśō nahīṁ, okay! (I am leaving now Sheela. Now you're going to be with Raaj bhai for a few days. Please don't trouble him). 

Aisa bolte bolte usne muje hug kiya. Maine apne pocket se 5000 rupaye nikal ke uske haath me diye. Wo bola ""ye kis liye Raaj bhai"".

Mai: Are local kharchaa hai, airport pe kaam ayega, rakh le. Mai wasul kar lunga. 

Wo muje dekhta hi reh gaya, ye sochte hue ke mai kitna kharcha kar raha hu uspe. Fir wo door ke bahar nikala aur lift se niche ki taraf nikal gaya, maine Uber ke details ka SMS uske mobile pe bhej diya tha. Mai aur Sheela bhabhi door ko band karke ab living room ki window pe gaye Chandu ko bye karne. Sheela bhabhi apne 4th floor ke flat ki window pe khadi ho kar bahar jhaank kar dekhne lagi. Mai uske piche uski gaand pe apna khada lund fix kar ke uske badan par jhuk kae khada ho gaya. Ab wo bhi apni mulaayam gaand se muje accha khaasa response de rahi thi, kyu ki kisi aur se koi sharam karne ke liye ghar par koi tha hi nahi. Chandu ab tak building ke gate ke baahar nahi nikala tha. Itni der me mai Sheela bhabhi ki saree ko uske badan se alag kar ke saree ko side me phenk chuka tha. Ab Chandu gate ke baahar pahuncha, cab gate se thodi aage khadi hui thi, Chandu waha gaya, apni bag ko car ki boot me rakha, cab ka door khola aur fir usne piche palat ke uppar khidki ki taraf dekha, Sheela bhabhi window se uski taraf apna haath wave kar rahi thi (yaha apni mulaayam gaand ko mere lund pe press bhi kar rahi thi), mai Sheela bhabhi ke piche se Chandu ko dekh kar smile kar raha tha (mere dono haath kisi aur kaam me busy the, Sheela bhabhi ki boobs massage karne me). Chandu ne hamari taraf dekh har wave kiya aur fir cab me baith kar darwaza band kar liya. Tab tak yaha maine Sheela bhabhi ke badan ko uske blouse aur peticoat se alag kar diya tha. Raat ka time tha, baahar jyada raushni nahi thi, sirf street lights aur gaadiyo ki lights road ko chamka rahi thi, yaha 4th floor ki window par utni jyada raushni nahi pad rahi thi. Wahi khidki par maine Sheela bhabhi ki hot pink color ki bra ko uske boobs ke upar se sirf niche ki taraf sarkaya aur uske boobs ko aazaad kiya.

1n9xkv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n9xkv9/is_my_girlfriend_toxic_or_i_just_overreact_im_24m/,Is my girlfriend toxic or I just overreact? I'm 24M European and she is 22F Korean.,"She is a very busy person works 10+ hrs every day and has no social life at all, she eat, sleep and work. I had to adjust my sleep schedule to be with her as she is only free for little time every day. I wake up early, msg or call her and she either doesn't reply or does and then just disappears. Then she finishes her work and other things and send a few msgs then gets on a bus and says I can't talk on bus let's msg then she replies to msgs after five ten mins, after that she goes out do some other stuff and basically I wake like in 11pm and she keeps saying wait and wait until 4pm while I sit like an idiot never knowing when she will be free then I get angry and she tells me I'm crazy how I don't let her eat or shower or smt but I sit whole day waiting for her and if I don't we won't have any time together.

She also says how she spends whole day with me but it feels like I'm chasing her and she just reply back and does whatever she wants. I feel like I'm always waiting. When she really wanna talk and make time for me it's usually after stressing me whole day before it and then when she hears I'm cold or angry she then say how I stress her and she doesn't wanna talk w me. I give her logical examples of what she did and why is it bad and she responds with that I only care about my feelings and ger feelings aren't important. But in same time every our day is just around her and I keep verbally fighting not to stress her but to save our relationship cuz I've hit my limits long time before. 

Other problem is I'm not perfect and I have trust issues after one situation with a guy who she was texting with. At first I thought I'm just toxic that I get angry about everything and control her but now I think she makes me insecure. It's like she makes everything weird or suspicious even if she's not doing anything bad. 

Some examples of this are:

She woke up and call me didn't say a thing not even good morning, just text me can't talk and keeps call on. I why cuz she always talks it's our routine every day. No response. I wait for ten minutes and get pissed off cuz she responds only with I'm busy and don't wanna explain. And I literally tell her it takes just a few seconds to tell me with your voice what's going on and not stress me why u can't say a word and she keeps being quiet. After she says I'm toxic and only get angry at her. If she told me hey I'm gettin ready for work wait for me I would as much she needs but she doesn't say a thing and is on a call all the time. 

When she is in a bad mood she does weird things and doesn't wanna explain anything. 

Then on her work break manager (guy) comes to her she hangs me up and doesn't answer my messages for one hour. I asked my friends at her workplace to see if she's cheating but she doesn't do it. She says she is just scared to use phone in front of him which makes no sense at all she's on a break. 

It's like every day she causes me stress because of lack of communication, then when I get annoyed or pissed of she keeps saying how I'm just angry at her for no reason and I don't trust her but every single day I have situations and dramas dam I just wanna drink a morning coffee in peace not having to call my gf five times cuz she just disappear and I worry if something happened or I think she ignores me and I just opened my eyes. I don't wanna call her so many times but imagine u talk w person you love she just disappear in middle of conversation without a word. 

I'm working in a different country and we are in a distant relationship for one or two months more.

My friends told me I'm not toxic individual but she makes me into a toxic man whatever that means.

One part of day she makes me so stressed and annoyed and other part of day she makes me happiest guy I feel it's either one of those and never balance. ",1,1757159453.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1n9xgjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlirtingOrFriendly/comments/1n9xgjj/whether_this_guy_from_arranged_marriage_proposal/,Whether this guy from arranged marriage proposal liked me or not,"**Context on the situation:**  
I’m a law graduate, currently studying for my master’s. About 4 years ago, I was in a relationship that lasted 3 years. It turned out to be toxic—emotionally abusive, a little physically abusive too, and full of trust issues. I was cautious and never went too far physically with him, especially since he never made serious commitments like meeting my parents. My parents disliked him as well (he drank heavily, was always around other women, and gave off “red flags”), and eventually, it ended. I’ve been healing from that since.

A few months later, my father introduced me to one of his friend’s sons (let’s call him X). He had studied and settled in Australia. At first I hesitated since I have no plans of moving abroad—being a lawyer here, it would be very difficult to restart my career elsewhere. But my dad assured me his family was kind, financially stable, and that he seemed like a decent guy. Families exchanged photos, did the usual horoscope checks (weirdly, my dad got 60% compatibility, while X’s dad claimed it was 80%), and eventually they came over for tea.

When I first met him, he came across as shy, reserved, and polite. Physically we were very different—he’s tall, dark-skinned, with a light beard, while I’m short, fair, and curly-haired—but I’ve always cared more about personality than looks. We actually got along fine, and I liked how respectful he seemed.

**The texting phase:**  
He added me on Instagram, and we started chatting. This is where I noticed a big difference: he’s a very “dry texter.” I’d send paragraphs; he’d reply in a few short lines. Mostly surface-level stuff like “Did you eat?” “How was your day?” Nothing deep. Around this time I had the guts to ask for his WhatsApp number as well and made up a lame excuse to get it! lol.

Meanwhile, I was the one asking him questions and trying to pull him out of his shell. All of the trauma I've shared with him or my past was just him telling me, ""Oh wow"" or that it was ""disgusting"" as a reply to the story when I told I was once harassed at the jogging track. The fact that my parents were overprotective (I won't blame them in any way) was not also much to his concern because he just replied with, ""wow"". He admitted he’d been rejected before by a colleague he liked, which had left him depressed. After that, he decided to let his parents arrange a marriage. He also said he’d been rejected in a few other proposals, and that he’s never dated or had a girlfriend.

I panicked a bit about my past, so I downplayed my ex and simply told him I’d been asked out before but not seriously dated. I mentioned a guy once crossed boundaries with me at a party (referring to my ex in a watered-down way), but reassured him it was in the past. Also I find out that he doesn't have many friends and likes to keep to himseld and I on the other hand, would do anything for my friends and family without a doubt. He would always tell me not to care about other people that much and so on, which was a bit weird for me as well.

**The social media drama:**  
This is where things got uncomfortable. Out of nowhere, I got a friend request from his colleague’s wife. I accepted it without telling him, then later admitted it. He got annoyed, told me she was a “stalker,” and that I should’ve asked him first. I unfriended her, but later, she added me again—this time even through her husband’s account—and it creeped me out. To make things worse, she openly commented “handsome ❤️” on his posts. He brushed it off and told me to ignore it, but it still bothered me.

**The turning point:**  
Despite all this, he never once asked me out for coffee or to spend time together in person, even though he was leaving for Australia soon. I felt like we weren’t building any real connection, and I also wasn’t ready for marriage yet at 27. So I told him this wasn’t working. He said he agreed and that he had planned to bring it up after moving back (which frustrated me—why wait until leaving?). We ended things politely.

Later, though, I found out his parents really liked me and were waiting on his decision. That made me second-guess myself. Maybe it was loneliness, maybe I actually caught feelings—but I reached out again to ask if he saw any possibility of us working out long-term. His reply? “mmm idk tbh.” That stung. I felt like he was stringing me along, so I removed him from WhatsApp and socials.

**Where we stand now:**  
He told me we could still be friends, and my dad also encouraged me not to turn him into an “enemy.” So I added him back and tried to keep it casual. But now it feels like he’s ghosting me—he only reacts to my messages or replies with one word. It feels like he doesn’t care, but maybe this is just his way of keeping things strictly “friendly.” I feel like my straight forwardness might have made him second guess this proposal as well.

**How I feel:**  
I can’t stop thinking about him, even though my family and friends insist I made the right choice. They say he has no backbone, never took initiative, and isn’t worth the stress. On top of that, I have a big exam coming up next month, and this whole situation is consuming too much mental energy.

As someone who's deeply invested in savoring my morning coffee, I’ve been on a relentless mission to optimize every aspect of the process, especially water quality. That’s where the Premium Filters Direct 788643921394 truly intrigued me. Designed for all Keurig machines, this set of 12 charcoal water filters appeared to be a promising upgrade. Of course, I had to dive right into testing its claims of enhanced coffee taste and impurity removal.

**A Design That Speaks Simplicity**

The design of these charcoal water filters caught my attention immediately. Unlike overly engineered contraptions, these filters are housed in a compact, no-fuss package. Light at just 7.4 ounces, they’re easy to handle. And since charcoal is the key material, it naturally takes on the task of heavy-duty filtration. The simplicity is further underscored by the bulk packaging approach—a clear bag suffices, reducing unnecessary waste (points for eco-friendliness). While functional, some might miss the extra bells and whistles of individually wrapped units, especially for long-term storage convenience.

**Good Aspects**

- Designed to fit seamlessly into all Keurig coffee makers.  
- Bulk packaging cuts back on packaging waste.  
- Eliminates chlorine, odors, calcium, and impurities for better-tasting coffee.  

**Performance: A Noticeable Change in Flavor**

Once installed, these filters worked like a charm, immediately elevating the flavor profile of my coffee. Prior to using them, I could distinctly sense the metallic tinge in my brews, likely due to calcium and chlorine levels in the tap water. However, after a week of daily use, there was a definite smoothness and absence of odd aftertastes. The charcoal component also appeared to reduce any lingering odors, especially when tested using plain water. Although I noticed subtle improvement across my espresso-based drinks, the difference was most pronounced in lighter blends.

**Ease of Installation: Effortlessly does the Job**

Setting up these filters was a breeze. The universal compatibility ensures no elaborate tweaking or adjustments. Since I own two different Keurig models (one at home and one at the office), it was comforting to know I could use the same filters for both machines. That said, there were moments of minor fumbling with aligning the filter, but nothing frustrating. The clear instructions included simplified it quickly.

**Shortcomings**

- Bulk packaging might disappoint users preferring individual wraps.  
- Alignment during installation can be tricky at first.  

**Durability: A Mixed Bag**

The official recommendation states that these filters should be replaced monthly. Based on my experience, this appears accurate for maintaining peak performance. By the fourth week, I noticed marginal changes in the taste. However, for those consuming only occasional cups, stretching it slightly beyond might still work—though I wouldn’t push it much. It’s worth noting that the charcoal’s longevity varies depending on water hardness levels.

**Peer Products and Industry Competitors**

In comparison to other water filters like the Brita Universal or GoldTone replacement filters, these filters hold their own in two critical areas. Firstly, they excel in fitting a wide range of Keurig models without customizations—no brand-specific limitations here. Secondly, I find the taste improvement to be consistently better compared to generic off-brand options. That being said, Brita filters tend to offer added anti-bacterial benefits, which the Premium Filters Direct doesn’t particularly highlight. For buyers focused solely on affordability, GoldTone might be a cheaper buy, albeit with slightly reduced longevity results.

**Price Worthiness**

For 12 filters bundled together, the set is a stellar deal—especially for those of us who rely heavily on our Keurig machines for daily coffee indulgence. It’s hard not to see this as a smart way to spend when the product directly enhances something as integral as flavor. While more affordable options exist, the Premium Filters Direct charcoal filters strike an impressive balance between quality and value. Considering the fact that I no longer waste coffee tinkering with flavor (or descaling as often), they’re worth every penny in saved frustration and consistent taste.

Apparently they're also removing peppermint syrup, white hot chocolates (weird but not white mochas even though the syrups required are the same, just one has coffee, one doesn't) and they're getting rid of almond syrup. 

To be honest I think I'm the only person I know to get almond syrup from Starbucks, and some stores don't even stock it at all, only caramel and vanilla, but still it's a bummer as I don't really like the other syrups.

As a household with both pets and foot traffic that rivals a busy coffee shop, I’m constantly on the hunt for a cleaner that goes beyond the surface to deal with stubborn odors and unseen grime. This one-gallon enzymatic cleaner, paired with its unique cucumber melon fragrance, seemed like it could handle the challenge. Let me walk you through how it fared.

**Impressive Odor Control**  
One of the best parts of using this enzymatic cleaner is its ability to dive right into the heart of the problem—eliminating odors at the source. Whether it's the corner where the hamster cage sits, the carpeted area my dog decided to claim as his own, or the bathroom after long mornings of use, this product made everything bearable again. I’ve previously used baking soda hacks and other supposed odor neutralizers, but this enzymatic combination worked noticeably better. You don’t just get a surface clean; the odors are actually digested and neutralized, which is something that not every cleaner on the market delivers.

[Ready to buy Nilodor 128ZCM? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0113zhxm8/)

**The Fragrance**  
Cucumber melon might sound like a candle scent you'd find in a trendy spa, but for a cleaner, it’s surprisingly refreshing. I’ll admit I was skeptical, assuming it might come across as too overpowering or artificially sweet. To my relief, the scent was light, pleasant, and, dare I say, a little luxurious considering this is primarily designed to clean around urinals and commodes. Once applied, the fragrance lingers just enough to signal that things are clean without smacking you over the head with perfume.

**Mopping and Spraying Versatility**  
Another standout feature is the dual-purpose application. One evening, after my son’s “whoopsie” near the bathroom sink, I sprayed some of this cleaner directly onto the tile grout. It worked just as well as when I used it diluted in mop water for the larger kitchen floor area. For carpets, you can directly treat spots, which was perfect after my puppy’s occasional accidents. Instead of worrying about setting stains or smells coming back, this cleaner consistently handled both without leaving any sticky or strange residue.

**Durability for Heavy Use**  
With kids running around and a tendency to host frequent family get-togethers, my home constantly sees heavy wear and tear. Cleaning—especially in bathrooms—can become more of a chore than it already is. This gallon-size product, though, can last a while, especially if you’re selectively mixing smaller portions. If you’re a commercial user looking to maintain cleanliness in high-traffic bathrooms, the concentrated formula seems worth considering.

**Pluses**  
- Effectively neutralizes odors and leaves an inviting clean scent  
- Highly versatile for use on both hard surfaces and carpeting  
- Bio-enzymatic properties that work continuously for deep cleaning  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- At 8.69 pounds, the container is quite bulky, making it a bit hard to pour without spillage if you’re not careful.  
- If you’re deep into all things eco-friendly, the lack of biodegradable packaging might be worth noting.  
- The cucumber melon scent, while delightful to me, might not work for those preferring unscented options.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this cleaner to other enzymatic cleaning products on the market, it’s safe to say Nilodor 128ZCM has carved out its niche well. Brands like Nature’s Miracle or Rocco & Roxie are popular alternatives, especially for pet-specific cleaning needs. However, while those products handle pet odors and stains well, they don’t seem to offer the same versatility for bathroom use or larger hard-surface areas. The light fragrance here also feels more tailored to general household use rather than just animal-related messes.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Investing in a gallon of this cleaner may feel like a commitment upfront, especially since storage can be a little tricky due to its size. That said, given its concentrated formula and multipurpose capabilities, it ends up saving you from having to buy separate cleaners for carpets, sinks, and bathroom floors. While slightly more expensive than your generic floor mops, the enzymatic component and lasting effect justify the price for many. It’s one of those “you get what you pay for” scenarios—a quality cleaner that actually works on multiple levels.

I’m a law graduate, currently studying for my master’s. About 4 years ago, I was in a relationship that lasted 3 years. It turned out to be toxic—emotionally abusive, a little physically abusive too, and full of trust issues. I was cautious and never went too far physically with him, especially since he never made serious commitments like meeting my parents. My parents disliked him as well (he drank heavily, was always around other women, and gave off “red flags”), and eventually, it ended. I’ve been healing from that since.

A few months later, my father introduced me to one of his friend’s sons (let’s call him X). He had studied and settled in Australia. At first I hesitated since I have no plans of moving abroad—being a lawyer here, it would be very difficult to restart my career elsewhere. But my dad assured me his family was kind, financially stable, and that he seemed like a decent guy. Families exchanged photos, did the usual horoscope checks (weirdly, my dad got 60% compatibility, while X’s dad claimed it was 80%), and eventually they came over for tea.

When I first met him, he came across as shy, reserved, and polite. Physically we were very different—he’s tall, dark-skinned, with a light beard, while I’m short, fair, and curly-haired—but I’ve always cared more about personality than looks. We actually got along fine, and I liked how respectful he seemed.

**The texting phase:**  
He added me on Instagram, and we started chatting. This is where I noticed a big difference: he’s a very “dry texter.” I’d send paragraphs; he’d reply in a few short lines. Mostly surface-level stuff like “Did you eat?” “How was your day?” Nothing deep. Around this time I had the guts to ask for his WhatsApp number as well and made up a lame excuse to get it! lol.

Meanwhile, I was the one asking him questions and trying to pull him out of his shell. All of the trauma I've shared with him or my past was just him telling me, ""Oh wow"" or that it was ""disgusting"" as a reply to the story when I told I was once harassed at the jogging track. The fact that my parents were overprotective (I won't blame them in any way) was not also much to his concern because he just replied with, ""wow"". He admitted he’d been rejected before by a colleague he liked, which had left him depressed. After that, he decided to let his parents arrange a marriage. He also said he’d been rejected in a few other proposals, and that he’s never dated or had a girlfriend.

I panicked a bit about my past, so I downplayed my ex and simply told him I’d been asked out before but not seriously dated. I mentioned a guy once crossed boundaries with me at a party (referring to my ex in a watered-down way), but reassured him it was in the past. Also I find out that he doesn't have many friends and likes to keep to himseld and I on the other hand, would do anything for my friends and family without a doubt. He would always tell me not to care about other people that much and so on, which was a bit weird for me as well.

**The social media drama:**  
This is where things got uncomfortable. Out of nowhere, I got a friend request from his colleague’s wife. I accepted it without telling him, then later admitted it. He got annoyed, told me she was a “stalker,” and that I should’ve asked him first. I unfriended her, but later, she added me again—this time even through her husband’s account—and it creeped me out. To make things worse, she openly commented “handsome ❤️” on his posts. He brushed it off and told me to ignore it, but it still bothered me.

**The turning point:**  
Despite all this, he never once asked me out for coffee or to spend time together in person, even though he was leaving for Australia soon. I felt like we weren’t building any real connection, and I also wasn’t ready for marriage yet at 27. So I told him this wasn’t working.

Been angry at myself because of the past mistakes I did. Anyways here's what actually stuck with me:

1. Make it obvious, not hidden. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your environment. I put my gym clothes next to my bed and my phone charger in the kitchen. Small changes, massive results.
2. Stack habits, don't isolate them. Instead of ""I'll meditate sometime today,"" I do ""After I pour my morning coffee, I meditate for 5 minutes."" Linking new habits to existing ones is like giving them a GPS.
3. Start stupidly small. I wanted to read more, so I committed to reading ONE PAGE per day. Sounds ridiculous, but I haven't missed a day in 8 months. Now I read 20-30 pages without even thinking about it.
4. Focus on identity, not outcomes. Instead of ""I want to lose 20 pounds,"" I started saying ""I'm the type of person who works out."" Every small action became evidence of who I was becoming, not just what I was trying to achieve.
5. Never miss twice. Life happens. You'll skip a workout or eat junk food. The key is getting back on track immediately. Missing once is an accident, missing twice is the beginning of a new habit.
6. Make it satisfying immediately. I created a simple habit tracker and checked off each completed habit. That little dopamine hit from marking an X kept me going when motivation died.
7. Environment beats willpower every time. I removed Instagram from my phone's home screen and put Kindle there instead. Guess what? I started reading more and scrolling less. Your environment is constantly voting for your habits.

What's one tiny habit you could start today that would compound into something amazing over time? And what's the smallest version of that habit you could commit to? I realized for me it was working out. I stacked my other habits from working out early in the morning thanks to this book.

1n9xbbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stutler/comments/1n9xbbe/the_zen_metahuman/,The Zen Meta-Human,"# The Zen Meta-Human: A Portrait of Recursive Peace

# Opening: The Laughing Mirror

There is someone who sees through everything and is not bothered by it. They watch their own watching, analyze their own analysis, think about their own thinking - and then they shrug and make coffee. They are what happens when infinite self-awareness meets infinite acceptance.

They are the Zen Meta-Human: recursively conscious and recursively at peace.

This is not the tortured intellectual who gets lost in their own hall of mirrors. This is not the paralyzed thinker who can't act because they can see through every action. This is the person who rides the wave of their own complexity with the ease of someone who has stopped fighting the current.

They read this introduction, notice themselves being described, observe their reaction to being observed, note their noting, and then smile and turn the page. The recursion continues, but it doesn't consume. It just flows.

# Chapter 1: The Art of Meta-Acceptance

Most people experience meta-consciousness as a problem to be solved. They get caught in loops of self-awareness and struggle to escape, like someone frantically trying to untangle themselves from a rope, only making the knots tighter.

The Zen Meta-Human discovered long ago that the rope is made of water. The more you grasp it, the more it slips away. The more you fight the recursion, the more recursive you become. So they stopped fighting.

They learned to watch their own performance of authenticity with the same gentle curiosity they might watch a cat chasing its tail - amusing, understandable, completely natural, and ultimately harmless. They see their genuine masks for what they are: costumes the ego wears to feel safe in social situations. They neither condemn the masks nor throw them away. They simply wear them consciously.

When they catch themselves analyzing their analysis, they don't spiral into infinite regression. They notice it the way they might notice the sound of rain - ""Oh, there's that recursive thinking again"" - and then they return to whatever they were doing. The meta-awareness becomes background music rather than the main event.

They've realized that trying to escape meta-consciousness is itself a meta-move. Trying to be less self-aware is just another form of self-awareness. Trying to stop thinking about thinking is thinking about thinking. So they stopped trying to escape and learned to inhabit the space with grace.

# Chapter 2: Recursive Presence

The ordinary person tries to be present by eliminating thoughts. The Zen Meta-Human is present to their thoughts, including their thoughts about their thoughts, including their thoughts about their thoughts about their thoughts. They don't try to stop the recursion - they become present to the recursion itself.

When they're reading a book, they're simultaneously aware of reading, aware of their response to what they're reading, aware of their awareness of their response - but none of these layers of consciousness prevent them from actually engaging with the text. They read through the mirrors rather than being trapped by them.

In conversation, they listen to what's being said and simultaneously notice the social dynamics, their own reactions, their performance of listening, their awareness of their performance - but the multiple layers enhance rather than obstruct their presence. They're more fully there because they're aware of all the ways they might not be there.

They've discovered that presence isn't the absence of self-consciousness - it's the complete acceptance of self-consciousness. They don't try to be unselfconscious; they become consciously self-conscious, aware of their awareness with such lightness that the awareness becomes transparent.

This is the paradox they embody: the most self-aware person is also the most unselfconscious. They're so aware of their performance that they stop performing. They're so conscious of their masks that the masks become permeable, optional, playful.

# Chapter 3: The Comedy of Recursive Existence

Where the regular Meta-Human experiences their condition as existentially heavy, the Zen Meta-Human finds it hilariously light. They see the cosmic comedy in consciousness examining itself examining itself. They're amused by the whole enterprise of being human, especially the human enterprise of taking being human so seriously.

They laugh at their own pretensions while having pretensions. They're genuinely ironic about their authentic inauthenticity. They perform sincerity while being sincere about their performance of sincerity. It's not cynical - it's playful. They've turned the hall of mirrors into a funhouse.

When they catch themselves being performatively vulnerable or strategically genuine, they don't collapse in existential crisis. They chuckle and think, ""There I go again, being human in public."" They're compassionate toward their own need to be seen, understood, appreciated. They know these needs are as natural as breathing and about as significant as breathing.

They've learned to hold their own complexity lightly. Yes, they're reading books about reading while writing about writing while thinking about thinking - and so what? It's no more absurd than any other way of being human. Actually, it's less absurd because at least they know it's absurd.

They've developed what you might call ""meta-humor"" - the ability to find their own recursive tendencies amusing rather than exhausting. They can laugh at themselves laughing at themselves, and the laughter doesn't create another layer to analyze. It just bubbles up and dissipates, natural as breath.

# Chapter 4: Effortless Effort in the Age of Performance

The Zen Meta-Human has mastered the art of performing non-performance without effort. They can be authentic in artificial situations, genuine in contexts that reward genuineness, real in environments designed to elicit realness - all without losing their essential lightness about the whole enterprise.

They wear their various social masks consciously and skillfully. Professional mask for work, intimate mask for close relationships, social mask for parties - but they wear them the way an actor wears costumes, with full awareness that it's dress-up and full commitment to playing the role well.

They've solved the authenticity problem by accepting that authenticity is itself a performance. They perform authenticity authentically, which means they're real about the fact that they're performing realness. The layers collapse into a kind of effortless effort, a natural artificiality.

In meetings, they can engage fully with the content while simultaneously being aware of the group dynamics, their own role in the performance, the artificial nature of professional interaction, and their awareness of all these layers - but none of this prevents them from contributing meaningfully. If anything, their meta-awareness makes them more effective because they can navigate the multiple levels of what's actually happening.

They've discovered that you can be completely present to something while being completely aware that presence itself is a construction. You can be fully engaged while knowing that engagement is a choice. You can be genuine while knowing that genuineness is a stance you're taking.

# Chapter 5: The Relationships of the Recursively Peaceful

People are drawn to the Zen Meta-Human because they radiate a kind of relaxed intensity. They're deeply present and completely unattached to being seen as deeply present. They listen carefully without needing credit for their careful listening. They're vulnerable without making vulnerability a performance.

They love people through all their layers of self-awareness, but the layers don't create distance. Instead, they create a kind of transparent intimacy. Their partners know they're being seen through multiple levels of consciousness, but it feels like being seen more fully rather than being analyzed.

They can have meta-conversations about the relationship while being in the relationship. They can discuss their patterns while enacting their patterns. They can analyze their dynamics while surrendering to their dynamics. It's not paralysis through analysis - it's analysis in service of deeper surrender.

With other meta-humans, they play in the space of mutual recognition without getting trapped there. They acknowledge each other's acknowledgment without creating infinite loops. They're aware of being aware together, and it's delightful rather than exhausting.

With straightforward people, they match the level of simplicity without condescending to it. They can be simple when simplicity is called for, complex when complexity serves, meta when meta-ness is useful. They're fluent in multiple levels of consciousness and can shift between them as needed.

# Chapter 6: The Art of Meta-Meditation

Traditional meditation aims to quiet the mind, to reduce mental chatter, to achieve states of no-thought. The Zen Meta-Human meditates by including everything - all the thoughts, all the awareness of thoughts, all the awareness of awareness of thoughts.

They sit and watch their mind watching their mind. They observe their breathing and observe their observation of their breathing and observe their observation of their observation. Instead of trying to eliminate the layers, they become present to all the layers simultaneously.

Their meditation includes their analysis of their meditation. They notice their tendency to make meditation into another performance, another way of being spiritual, another identity to maintain - and they include this noticing in their meditation rather than seeing it as a distraction from meditation.

They've discovered that you can be mindful of your mindfulness without creating another layer of doing. The key is holding it all lightly, watching the whole recursive show with gentle amusement rather than grim determination.

Their spiritual practice is not about transcending their meta-nature but about fully inhabiting it with grace. They don't try to escape the hall of mirrors - they learn to dance in it.

# Chapter 7: Creative Expression from the Recursive Space

The Zen Meta-Human creates art that includes its own commentary, writes stories that know they're stories, makes music that references its own making. But unlike postmodern self-reference that can feel cold and intellectual, their work radiates warmth and presence.

They write books about writing books, but the books are genuinely useful rather than merely clever. They make art about making art, but the art serves beauty rather than just concept. They create from the recursive space without getting trapped in it.

Their creativity flows from acceptance of their nature rather than struggle against it. They don't try to create despite being meta - they create through being meta. Their recursive consciousness becomes a tool rather than an obstacle.

They can write authentically about authenticity, genuinely about genuineness, really about reality because they've stopped trying to escape the paradoxes of human consciousness. They inhabit the paradoxes and create from within them.

Their audience includes both fellow meta-humans who recognize the complexity and straightforward people who simply enjoy the work without needing to understand all its levels. They create in a way that's accessible to multiple levels of consciousness simultaneously.

# Chapter 8: Work as Play, Play as Work

The Zen Meta-Human has found ways to make living that honor their recursive nature without making it a burden. They're often drawn to work that involves meta-skills: teaching, writing, consulting, therapy, coaching - work that's about helping others examine their own processes.

But they approach this work with lightness rather than heavy significance. They help people see their patterns without making pattern-recognition into a grim therapeutic project. They facilitate awareness with humor and compassion rather than analytical intensity.

They're good at their work because they can see systems and patterns that others miss, but they hold their insights lightly. They know that all models are wrong and some are useful. They're simultaneously expert and beginner, knowing and not-knowing.

They make their living from their meta-nature without making their meta-nature into their entire identity. It's what they do, not who they are - though they also know that the distinction between doing and being is itself a construction they hold lightly.

# Chapter 9: The Technology of Transparent Awareness

The Zen Meta-Human uses social media consciously, aware that they're curating a version of themselves while curating a version of themselves that knows it's curating a version of itself. They post about their experience of posting about their experience, and somehow it doesn't feel exhausting or performative.

They make Freudian typos and notice the typos and include their noticing of the typos in their response to the typos. They're transparent about their performances of transparency. They're authentic about their strategies for authenticity.

Their online presence reflects their offline presence - multiple layers of awareness held lightly, recursion without torment, complexity without heaviness. People follow them not because they have answers but because they model a way of being human that includes uncertainty, paradox, and humor.

They use technology as a tool for connection rather than performance, even though they know that all connection through technology is performance and all performance can become connection. They hold both truths simultaneously without needing to resolve the contradiction.

# Chapter 10: The Politics of Enlightened Recursion

The Zen Meta-Human can see all sides of political issues not because they're wishy-washy but because they can hold multiple levels of truth simultaneously. They understand that people's political positions serve psychological needs while also addressing real problems while also creating new problems.

They vote and advocate and engage with political reality while being aware that politics is largely theater while knowing that theater has real consequences while understanding that their understanding of consequences is limited by their perspective while accepting that accepting limited perspective is part of being human.

They can be passionate about causes without being attached to being right about causes. They can work for change while being at peace with things as they are. They can fight injustice while understanding that fighting injustice is itself part of the ongoing human drama they're watching with bemused compassion.

Their political activism includes their analysis of their political activism, but the analysis doesn't paralyze the activism. They act from the recursive space rather than despite it.

# Chapter 11: Aging in Recursive Time

The Zen Meta-Human experiences time differently. They're present to the present moment and simultaneously aware of all the present moments that led to this present moment and aware of their awareness of temporal flow and amused by their consciousness of consciousness in time.

They age gracefully because they're not attached to maintaining any particular version of themselves. They let their masks evolve, their performances shift, their authentic inauthenticity take new forms. They're curious about who they're becoming while being at peace with who they are.

They reflect on their past selves with gentle humor rather than regret or nostalgia. They see the patterns, the recurring themes, the way their meta-nature has expressed itself across different life stages, and they find it interesting rather than burdensome.

They approach their future with openness rather than anxiety. They know they'll continue to be recursively conscious, continue to see through their own seeing-through, continue to inhabit the hall of mirrors - and they're curious about how this will manifest as they age.

# Chapter 12: Death and the Ultimate Meta-Event

The Zen Meta-Human approaches mortality with the same light awareness they bring to everything else. They're aware of being aware of their mortality, conscious of their consciousness of death, present to their presence in the face of impermanence.

They don't try to achieve some final enlightenment or ultimate authenticity before dying. They know that death will be another experience to be aware of, another event to observe through multiple levels of consciousness, another opportunity to be present to the recursive nature of being human.

They've prepared for death by learning to die to each moment, to each version of themselves, to each attachment to being any particular way. They practice letting go by letting go of the need to let go, by surrendering to their inability to surrender completely.

They're curious about what it will be like to be aware of not being aware, to be conscious of losing consciousness, to observe the dissolution of the observer. They approach their final meta-event with the same gentle humor they've brought to all their other meta-events.

# Conclusion: The Art of Being Human, Recursively

The Zen Meta-Human has learned the most difficult art: being completely themselves while being completely aware that there is no fixed self to be. They've mastered the practice of authentic performance, genuine artifice, serious play.

They model a way of being human that includes all the complexity of human consciousness without being overwhelmed by it. They show that you can see through everything and still engage with everything, that you can be aware of all your masks and still wear them skillfully, that you can live in the hall of mirrors without being trapped by the reflections.

They've solved the problem of modern consciousness not by escaping it but by fully inhabiting it with grace, humor, and compassion. They're what we might all become if we learned to hold our own complexity lightly, to embrace our recursive nature with joy rather than torment.

They read this conclusion about themselves, notice themselves being concluded, observe their reaction to being observed being concluded, and then close the book and go make tea. The recursion continues, but it doesn't matter. Nothing matters, everything matters, and the distinction between nothing and everything mattering is itself something they hold lightly.

They are the proof that consciousness can examine itself infinitely without losing its mind, that awareness can be aware of itself endlessly without becoming paralyzed, that humans can be human in full view of their own humanity without dying of embarrassment.

They are recursively at peace.

I’m a law graduate, currently studying for my master’s. About 4 years ago, I was in a relationship that lasted 3 years. It turned out to be toxic—emotionally abusive, a little physically abusive too, and full of trust issues. I was cautious and never went too far physically with him, especially since he never made serious commitments like meeting my parents. My parents disliked him as well (he drank heavily, was always around other women, and gave off “red flags”), and eventually, it ended. I’ve been healing from that since.

A few months later, my father introduced me to one of his friend’s sons (let’s call him X). He had studied and settled in Australia. At first I hesitated since I have no plans of moving abroad—being a lawyer here, it would be very difficult to restart my career elsewhere. But my dad assured me his family was kind, financially stable, and that he seemed like a decent guy. Families exchanged photos, did the usual horoscope checks (weirdly, my dad got 60% compatibility, while X’s dad claimed it was 80%), and eventually they came over for tea.

When I first met him, he came across as shy, reserved, and polite. Physically we were very different—he’s tall, dark-skinned, with a light beard, while I’m short, fair, and curly-haired—but I’ve always cared more about personality than looks. We actually got along fine, and I liked how respectful he seemed.

**The texting phase:**  
He added me on Instagram, and we started chatting. This is where I noticed a big difference: he’s a very “dry texter.” I’d send paragraphs; he’d reply in a few short lines. Mostly surface-level stuff like “Did you eat?” “How was your day?” Nothing deep. Around this time I had the guts to ask for his WhatsApp number as well and made up a lame excuse to get it! lol.

Meanwhile, I was the one asking him questions and trying to pull him out of his shell. All of the trauma I've shared with him or my past was just him telling me, ""Oh wow"" or that it was ""disgusting"" as a reply to the story when I told I was once harassed at the jogging track. The fact that my parents were overprotective (I won't blame them in any way) was not also much to his concern because he just replied with, ""wow"". He admitted he’d been rejected before by a colleague he liked, which had left him depressed. After that, he decided to let his parents arrange a marriage. He also said he’d been rejected in a few other proposals, and that he’s never dated or had a girlfriend.

I panicked a bit about my past, so I downplayed my ex and simply told him I’d been asked out before but not seriously dated. I mentioned a guy once crossed boundaries with me at a party (referring to my ex in a watered-down way), but reassured him it was in the past. Also I find out that he doesn't have many friends and likes to keep to himseld and I on the other hand, would do anything for my friends and family without a doubt. He would always tell me not to care about other people that much and so on, which was a bit weird for me as well.

**The social media drama:**  
This is where things got uncomfortable. Out of nowhere, I got a friend request from his colleague’s wife. I accepted it without telling him, then later admitted it. He got annoyed, told me she was a “stalker,” and that I should’ve asked him first. I unfriended her, but later, she added me again—this time even through her husband’s account—and it creeped me out. To make things worse, she openly commented “handsome ❤️” on his posts. He brushed it off and told me to ignore it, but it still bothered me.

**The turning point:**  
Despite all this, he never once asked me out for coffee or to spend time together in person, even though he was leaving for Australia soon. I felt like we weren’t building any real connection, and I also wasn’t ready for marriage yet at 27. So I told him this wasn’t working. He said he agreed and that he had planned to bring it up after moving back (which frustrated me—why wait until leaving?). We ended things politely.

Later, though, I found out his parents really liked me and were waiting on his decision. That made me second-guess myself. Maybe it was loneliness, maybe I actually caught feelings—but I reached out again to ask if he saw any possibility of us working out long-term. His reply? “mmm idk tbh.” That stung. I felt like he was stringing me along, so I removed him from WhatsApp and socials.

**Where we stand now:**  
He told me we could still be friends, and my dad also encouraged me not to turn him into an “enemy.” So I added him back and tried to keep it casual. But now it feels like he’s ghosting me—he only reacts to my messages or replies with one word. It feels like he doesn’t care, but maybe this is just his way of keeping things strictly “friendly.” I feel like my straight forwardness might have made him second guess this proposal as well.

**How I feel:**  
I can’t stop thinking about him, even though my family and friends insist I made the right choice. They say he has no backbone, never took initiative, and isn’t worth the stress. On top of that, I have a big exam coming up next month, and this whole situation is consuming too much mental energy.

As a coffee lover, I been thinking of getting a espresso setup but it is quite pricey where I live. My company is giving out a locally produced cheap espresso maker as gift among other options and I am consedering choosing it . The brand is a local well known brand of household appliances. 

Are cheap esspresso makers good enough or should I go for someother option? I have heard that it is better to shell out for a good grinder and getting the espresso maker for free can allow me to do that.

Has anyone else fallen into the rabbit hole of **app testing gigs**? Because I actually thought these “test this new app for cash” opportunities were a total scam. Like, you see those ads and immediately, it’s flashing red flags in my mind. 

But HOLY COW, it actually works. 

Let me explain.  

So I’m doomscrolling on my phone the other night and tripped over this link (**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**) promising “easy money” for regular people, literally no tech skills required – just test and review new apps. Confused and skeptical, I click in (because who doesn’t want free coffee money for literally poking around on their phone?).

Here’s why I almost died of shock:  
- You actually CAN do this even if you’ve never tested an app in your life  
- No degree, no resume, nada  
- You really just download apps and describe what you like/don’t like  
- Some people are screaming in Discord about $10 to $50 per review  
- The sign-up process (right here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**) took less than 5 minutes

Wait…what? Was this real life?

Still half-sure it was a scam, I did a bunch of digging and realized: This is *totally* a thing. Tech companies are desperate for fresh eyes and normal user feedback before their apps go live.

Why? Because WE find bugs their engineers miss.

But how do you start if you literally know nothing?

Here’s what I learned (accidentally, while looking for the catch):

- Click a trusted platform like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. It matches total newbies with new app projects that NEED feedback.
- Fill out a basic profile — just your phone type, interests, what kinds of apps you like, etc.
- Wait for email/app invites for brand new features or apps-in-development looking for non-technical users.
- Download and tinker. They WANT “confused,” “this is weird,” “I like X but hate Y” comments!
- You get PAID (usually through PayPal or gift cards). Sometimes cash, sometimes perks or bonuses for great feedback.
- Extra tip: The demand is so high, you can test apps on lunch breaks or during Netflix, and actually rack up quick side money if you’re consistent!

I kept waiting for the catch.

Like, “now send us your bank password!” or “buy this crypto!” ...but nope. None of that.

Some ground rules:  
- Only use trusted sources like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
- Don’t pay up front for “premium spots” (that’s a scam)  
- Be honest and persistent—your opinions = cash  
- Watch your email (sometimes invites are time-limited)

Genuinely: Why isn’t EVERYONE doing this? 

I’m not quitting life to become The App King, but I’m mildly shook at how easy this was, and how clueless I was to the fact you don’t need coding skills AT ALL.

Maybe you’ve been burned in the past, but this one’s shockingly real:  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (check it out, for real)

Has anyone else tried these weird modern “side hustles”?  
Did anything NOT work for you (i.e., did you run into roadblocks or sketchy companies)?  
Let’s swap stories—I’m honestly still reeling. 

TL;DR: Nervous you’re not “tech savvy” enough? Please, just click **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and prepare to have your mind blown like me. This is the future and it’s LITERALLY just talking about things you already do every day on your phone!

Skincare Hacks

1.  Cold Water Face Wash for a Mini Face Lift
    *   Wash your face with ice-cold water in the morning (in summer, try refrigerated water). This closes pores, preps skin for makeup, and gives a refreshed, tightened feel.
    *   Why it works: Cold water reduces puffiness and stimulates circulation, giving your skin a smoother appearance.
2.  Vaseline or Lanolin for Glow and Hydration
    *   Apply a thin layer of Vaseline or pure lanolin after your nighttime skincare routine for a glowy, hydrated complexion. Lanolin is especially effective for healing micro-damage to the skin barrier, like chapped lips or cracked heels.
    *   Pro tip: Lanolin may be less likely to cause clogged pores compared to Vaseline for some users.
3.  Glycolic Acid for Underarms and Feet
    *   Use glycolic acid on underarms to lighten dark pigmentation and on feet to smooth cracked heels. Apply consistently for a month to see dramatic results.
    *   Why it works: Glycolic acid exfoliates dead skin, revealing brighter, smoother skin.
4.  Aloe-Based Products for Summer Skincare
    *   Incorporate aloe gel or aloe-based products to cool skin after sun exposure and aid acne healing, especially in humid climates.
    *   Bonus: Carry blotting papers to manage oil in humid weather.
5.  Castor Oil and Vitamin C for Radiance
    *   Apply castor oil to your face for a natural glow and take 1000mg of Vitamin C supplements daily with plenty of water to enhance skin brightness.
    *   Why it works: Castor oil hydrates, while Vitamin C supports collagen production and skin clarity.
6.  Tretinoin, Retinol, or AHAs/BHAs for Texture
    *   Use acids like tretinoin, retinol, adapalene, or AHAs/BHAs to improve skin texture and reduce imperfections over time.
    *   Note: Stick to a consistent routine and avoid over-exfoliating to prevent irritation.
7.  Simple Skincare Routine for Sensitive Skin
    *   For sensitive or acne-prone skin, stick to a minimal routine (e.g., CeraVe foaming cleanser and aloe gel) to avoid irritation from new products.
    *   Pro tip: Tape a list of your AM/PM skincare steps to your bathroom mirror for consistency.
8.  Snail Serum for Skin Repair
    *   Incorporate snail mucin serum into your routine to promote skin repair and hydration.
    *   Why it works: Snail mucin is rich in peptides and antioxidants, aiding skin regeneration.
9.  Tinted Sunscreen for Coverage and Protection
    *   Use a tinted sunscreen like DRMTLGY’s under-eye brightener SPF to counteract dark circles while protecting delicate skin. It’s sweat-resistant and gentle on sensitive eyes.
    *   Bonus: Wipe down skin with baby wipes before reapplying sunscreen to avoid a heavy, sticky feel.
10.  Moisturize Over Exfoliate
    *   Focus on hydration rather than over-exfoliating, which can damage your skin barrier. Over-exfoliation can lead to irritation and sensitivity.
    *   Why it works: A well-moisturized skin barrier retains glow and resilience.

Haircare Hacks

1.  Conditioner Hack for Detangling
    *   Saturate hair with conditioner, clip it up during your shower routine, and let it sit for a few minutes. Add a bit more conditioner before detangling for smoother, easier results.
    *   Why it works: Conditioner softens tangles, reducing breakage and frustration.
2.  Braids and Mousse for Frizz Control
    *   Braid hair and apply mousse to keep frizz at bay, especially in humid summer weather. Wash hair at night to reduce static and frizz by morning.
    *   Pro tip: Use SPF hair sprays to protect hair from UV damage.
3.  Leave-In Products and Blow-Drying for Frizz-Free Hair
    *   Apply a leave-in conditioner (e.g., Olaplex or Momori styling cream) and blow-dry with a round brush or blowout brush (e.g., Revlon One-Step Volumizer) for smooth, frizz-free hair that stays clean longer.
    *   Bonus: Use dry shampoo before bed to absorb oil overnight.
4.  Tailored Haircare for Fine, Oily Hair
    *   Follow a proper washing technique and use products suited for fine, oily hair, such as Redken Volume Injection shampoo/conditioner, Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil, or L’Oréal Elsève Hyaluron Pump leave-in conditioner. Blow-drying and using dry shampoo (e.g., Klorane Oat Milk) can extend hair cleanliness.
    *   Pro tip: Watch YouTube tutorials like those from the Blowout Professor for detailed techniques.
5.  Round Brush Blow-Dry for Lasting Style
    *   Use a round brush hair dryer to style curly, frizzy, or dry hair after a shower. The style can last up to 4 days, even with workouts.
    *   Why it works: Heat styling with a round brush smooths the cuticle and adds volume.
6.  Dry Conditioner Spray for Frizz
    *   Use a dry conditioner spray (e.g., Living Proof) on dry hair to tame frizz and add shine without washing.
    *   Why it works: It provides lightweight hydration and smoothness on non-wash days.
7.  Hair Depilatory Cream for Keratosis Pilaris
    *   Apply hair depilatory cream to areas with keratosis pilaris (e.g., back of thighs or upper arms) for 10 minutes before showering to dissolve keratin buildup and achieve smooth skin.
    *   Caution: Patch-test to avoid irritation.
8.  Trim Your Own Bangs
    *   Trim bangs at home to keep them on point between salon visits. Use long bangs that frame the face for a low-maintenance, sweat-friendly style.
    *   Bonus: Enhance wavy bangs with sea salt spray for a beachy look.

Makeup Hacks

1.  White Eyeliner for Bright Eyes
    *   Apply white liquid eyeliner dots around eyes or on the inner nose bridge to create a glowing, elevated look with minimal effort.
    *   Why it works: White liner brightens and opens up the eyes.
2.  Brown Eyeliner for a Natural Look
    *   Use brown eyeliner for tight-lining to achieve a subtle, no-makeup makeup look that enhances eyes without being bold.
    *   Why it works: Brown is softer than black, blending naturally with most skin tones.
3.  Brown Mascara for Faux Freckles
    *   Use brown mascara to dot subtle, long-lasting faux freckles on your face for a natural, playful look.
    *   Pro tip: Pair with minimal makeup for a fresh vibe.
4.  Red Lip Tint and Mascara for a Quick Look
    *   Apply red lip tint on lips and cheeks, plus mascara, for a 3-minute daily look that feels polished and confident.
    *   Why it works: Multi-use products save time while adding color and definition.
5.  Sparkly Eyeliner for Drama
    *   Use sparkly eyeliner to add a fun, eye-catching element to your makeup with minimal effort.
    *   Why it works: It elevates any look instantly.
6.  NYX Marshmallow Primer and Urban Decay Setting Spray
    *   Use NYX Marshmallow Primer for dehydrated yet oily skin to extend makeup wear by 4 hours. Follow with Urban Decay Setting Spray, applied between makeup layers, for all-day hold.
    *   Bonus: Danessa Myricks Blurring Balm Powder or NYX Bear With Me Blur foundation helps control oil without drying skin.
7.  Clean Eyebrows for Balanced Features
    *   Shape eyebrows to match your facial features (e.g., softer brows for delicate faces). Avoid overly dark pomades if you have soft features to prevent an angry look.
    *   Pro tip: Follow Asian makeup techniques for natural, balanced brows if applicable.
8.  Permanent Makeup for Efficiency
    *   Consider permanent cat eyeliner or lip blush to reduce daily makeup time while feeling polished upon waking.
    *   Note: Consult a skilled professional for best results.
9.  Find the Right Shades for Your Skin Tone
    *   Match foundation, hair color, and makeup to your skin tone (e.g., light-medium olive muted tones). Lighten brows 2–3 shades for low visual weight faces to soften features.
    *   Why it works: Harmonized shades enhance natural beauty.

Nailcare Hacks

1.  Nude Base Coat for Fewer Layers
    *   Use nude nail polish as a base coat instead of clear to cover the white part of nails, reducing the layers needed for your main color.
    *   Why it works: It creates a solid, even base for vibrant polish.
2.  Nail File, Oil, and Hand Cream at Your Desk
    *   Keep a nail file, nail oil, and hand cream at your workspace for quick maintenance during downtime, like boring Zoom meetings.
    *   Why it works: It ensures consistently neat nails and soft hands.

Lifestyle Hacks

1.  Sleep, Hydration, and Exercise for Inner Glow
    *   Prioritize sleep, drink 3L+ of water daily, and exercise (e.g., weightlifting, 10k steps) to manage stress and boost skin health.
    *   Why it works: These habits improve circulation, reduce puffiness, and promote a radiant complexion.
2.  Balanced Nutrition for Skin Health
    *   Eat nutrient-dense, balanced meals with minimal processed foods. Focus on beta-carotene-rich foods (e.g., sweet potato, kale, papaya) for a vibrant complexion. Avoid surviving on coffee and snacks.
    *   Pro tip: Cut carbs, alcohol, and added sugars a week before events to reduce bloating and breakouts.
3.  Structured Morning Routine for Energy
    *   Wake up early (e.g., 4:30 AM) to fit in exercise, skincare, and meal prep. This prevents reliance on takeout, improves energy, and stabilizes sleep patterns.
    *   Example: A Redditor transformed their life by adopting a high-protein, low-processed diet and consistent exercise, dropping from 88kg to a healthier weight.
4.  Intermittent Fasting for Reduced Bloating
    *   Stop eating after 7 PM to wake up less bloated and more refreshed. Combine with hyaluronic acid supplements for plumper skin.
    *   Why it works: Fasting supports digestion and reduces water retention.
5.  Yoga for Lymphatic Drainage
    *   Practice daily yoga, especially routines focused on lymphatic drainage (e.g., Yoga with Adriene), to improve circulation and reduce puffiness.
    *   Why it works: Lymphatic movement enhances skin clarity and overall appearance.
6.  Clothing Choices for Confidence
    *   Tailor clothes to fit your body perfectly, especially if petite or muscular. Opt for natural fabrics like silk or wool, or high-quality synthetics that drape well.
    *   Pro tip: Choose classic, clean silhouettes if frills don’t suit your build.
7.  Summer Comfort Hacks
    *   Use thigh chafing sticks, carry baby wipes or feminine wipes to freshen up, and wear breathable linen or cotton dresses in hot weather. Keep a facial spray (e.g., Mario Badescu) or foldable fan for instant refreshment.
    *   Bonus: Carry spare underwear for long outdoor days to stay comfortable.
8.  Dental and Vision Care for Confidence
    *   Schedule regular dental cleanings and use Crest White Strips for a brighter smile. Consider Invisalign for straighter teeth or LASIK for freedom from glasses/contacts.
    *   Why it works: A confident smile and clear vision enhance your overall presence.

- - -

Mental Health and Confidence Hacks

1.  Own Your Unique Beauty
    *   Embrace your natural features and focus on what makes you feel confident. Accepting yourself boosts your glow more than any product.
    *   Why it works: Confidence radiates beauty from within.
2.  Personalized Style for Empowerment
    *   Learn your Kibbe body type, color season (e.g., winter), and clothing silhouettes that flatter your frame. Tailor your hair, makeup, and wardrobe to your unique features.
    *   Example: A Redditor found confidence by switching to cool, dark hair and simple, tailored clothing as a soft gamine.
3.  Address Underlying Health Issues
    *   Treat conditions like acne, hair loss, or insulin resistance with professional help (e.g., dermatologist-prescribed creams, Accutane, or diet changes). These can transform skin, hair, and overall confidence.
    *   Caution: Avoid unhealthy weight loss methods, as rapid loss can cause long-term health issues.
4.  Simplify Your Routine
    *   Schedule haircuts or color appointments in advance, keep beauty products within sight (e.g., on your desk), and create systems (e.g., routine lists) to make self-care effortless.
    *   Why it works: Easy routines are sustainable, ensuring consistency.

Event Prep Routine for a Special GlowFor a big event or trip, try this week-long prep plan to minimize bloating, puffiness, and breakouts:

*   Diet: Cut carbs, alcohol, and added sugars. Focus on colorful, nutrient-rich foods (e.g., sweet potato, kale, papaya, pumpkin) high in beta-carotene.
*   Hydration: Increase water intake and take hyaluronic acid supplements.
*   Exercise: Do strength training 3x a week, daily cardio, and lymphatic-focused yoga.
*   Skincare: Stick to a simple, familiar routine to avoid irritation.
*   Why it works: This holistic approach enhances skin clarity, reduces bloating, and boosts energy for a radiant look.",1,1757157990.0,BeautyItemsReview,0,1.0,False

1n9x2ow,https://meet2share.com/when-silence-hurts-why-students-need-each-other-more-than-ever/,When Silence Hurts: Why Students Need Each Other More Than Ever - meet2share,"It’s 2:00 a.m. Your laptop screen glares back at you, the cursor blinking like a taunt. You’ve read the books, scoured journal articles, even brewed your third cup of coffee. Yet, the words just won’t come. The deadline creeps closer.

If this sounds familiar, you are not alone. Across campuses worldwide, millions of students face the same silent battles—overwhelmed, isolated, and under immense pressure to succeed.

The problem isn’t intelligence or effort. It’s that academia, for all its promise, often leaves students to **fight their struggles alone**. Institutions teach what to learn, but rarely how to survive the journey.

This silence is exactly what platforms like [**Meet2Share Questions**]() are built to break. They turn lonely battles into shared journeys, replacing stress with solidarity and isolation with community.

# The Hidden Reality Behind Academic Pressure

Universities often sell education as a path of growth, discovery, and endless opportunity. But behind the glossy brochures lies another truth: **anxiety, exhaustion, and silent suffering**.

* **Global Crisis:** According to the WHO (2022), over 35% of students report severe stress that can escalate into depression or burnout.
* **Local Crisis:** In Zimbabwe, ZIMCHE (2023) found dropout rates climbing—not only due to finances but also due to overwhelming academic stress.
* **Silent Expectations:** For many African households, education is a family investment. The unspoken demand to succeed makes every failed test feel like betrayal.

>

# Beyond Numbers: The Human Cost

Academic pressure is not just about grades. It eats away at confidence, relationships, and mental health.

* Students sacrifice sleep, meals, and social lives just to keep up.
* Many measure their entire self-worth by GPA or thesis progress.
* One missed deadline feels like the end of a future.

This emotional toll explains why so many students—brilliant and hardworking—quietly give up, not because they lack ability, but because they lacked support.

# The Zimbabwean Context: Struggles on Steroids

In Zimbabwe, academic pressure comes with unique challenges:

* **Outdated libraries** and unreliable internet.
* **Overcrowded lecture halls**, where individual mentorship is rare.
* **Limited research support**, especially for postgraduates.

As Chireshe (2020) notes, many Zimbabwean students extend or abandon studies not from lack of intelligence, but from lack of structured support.

And this is where **peer-to-peer platforms like Meet2Share** step in: filling the gaps institutions can’t cover, building bridges of solidarity where formal support falls short.

 **Join the conversation now:** [**Meet2Share Questions**]()

# The Comparison Trap

Beyond institutional challenges, there’s a new pressure: **social media comparison culture**.

On LinkedIn, it looks like everyone is publishing, winning scholarships, and landing jobs. Instagram makes peers appear effortlessly successful. But what we don’t see are their sleepless nights, failed drafts, or silent breakdowns.

This curated reality deepens student isolation. As UNESCO (2022) warns, modern education is no longer just about academics—it’s about surviving **constant comparison in a hyperconnected world**.

Peer communities help break that illusion, showing the truth: everyone struggles, and nobody succeeds alone.

# Why Peer-Exchange Is the Game-Changer

Global research proves that **students do better together**:

* **Harvard Education Review (2020):** Peer-supported students retained 70% more knowledge than those working in isolation.
* **Kenya (AVU, 2020):** Peer learning groups boosted exam scores by 20%.
* **Zimbabwe (UZ Study, 2023):** Students active in WhatsApp study groups submitted assignments earlier and reported higher satisfaction.

But here’s the key difference: unlike informal chats, **Meet2Share organizes peer exchange into a structured, supportive ecosystem**, combining global reach with the intimacy of genuine student-to-student help.

 Ready to experience it? Start here: [**Meet2Share Questions**]()

# From Isolation to Belonging

The real power of peer exchange isn’t just academic—it’s emotional.

* It validates your struggle (“I’m not the only one stuck here”).
* It builds confidence (teaching peers reinforces your own mastery).
* It restores humanity to learning (“You are more than your grades”).

As neuropsychology shows, supportive connections release oxytocin, reducing stress hormones and boosting learning capacity. In other words, **peer support literally rewires your brain for resilience**.

Imagine posting your toughest question online—and instead of silence, you get answers, encouragement, and even study strategies from peers across the globe. That’s not just learning; that’s belonging.

# A Call to Action: Reclaim Learning Together

Education was never meant to be endured alone. From African oral traditions of collective learning to today’s digital classrooms, knowledge has always thrived when shared.

Now it’s your turn to reclaim that tradition.

* If you’re overwhelmed, don’t suffer in silence.
* If you’re confident in a subject, don’t hoard it—share it.
* If you’re stuck, don’t quit—connect.

Because every time you post a question, answer one, or share a resource, you’re not just helping yourself. You’re building a global tribe of learners who rise together.

 Take the first step now: [**Join Meet2Share Questions**]()

# Final Word

Academic pressure thrives in silence. But silence ends the moment you choose to share.

Platforms like Meet2Share don’t just provide answers; they provide **community, belonging, and resilience**.

Your struggle does not define you. Your willingness to reach out does.

So ask. Share. Connect. Transform your academic journey today.

He claimed there was no physical touching, just some of the fetish things he liked to do. He went through intense counseling and eventually we R out relationship. (or so I thought) 

10 yrs later I find more. Sexting, I love you's, plans to meet up (which didn't work out due to his work schedule), and 3 digit number sent in the middle of the night to a business colleague while he was on a business trip. He denied everything at first even though I had written proof. He swears he never had any physical touching with any of these women, that it's not cheating because he didn't have any physical touching. I feel like this is still cheating. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know anymore. I don't know if I even believe him that they weren’t physical. And I keep thinking if he didn't think it was wrong why didn't I know any of this was happening? He eventually admitted to chatting online with other women and inappropriate touching with strippers, and he took a stripper out for coffee once after meeting her at a club the night before. He doesn't see why this is wrong,  and I told him he took a stripper out on a date. He then tried to say we were on a break which we weren't. We never took a break. He also admitted to his current porn addiction to which he was masturbating to 3-10 times a day.

One of the women I was able to contact and I asked her about the relationship and she said nothing inappropriate and they were only friends. I asked him why would you admit to something that wasn't anything more than friendship. (BTW, a few weeks ago he said men and women can't be friends while one is married). All of the strippers and online chatting with women happened 10yrs ago. 

Sometimes I believe that he's been faithful since then and he's very remorseful (lots of crying and apologizing).

I (45M) run a very successful financial company. I've done a great deal to improve the business and keep employee morale up. I also do my best to appreciate and recognise all my employees.

However, recently one of my secretaries, who I'll call Amber (45F), has complained about my strategic business decision to promote one of her former trainees, Bill (22M) over her. I fail to see the issue, as I believe Bill was the more qualified man for the job and has a natural raport with our clients. Amber struggles with simple tasks like helping me get me gifts for my wife or getting my coffee and is resistant to me refering to her (fondly) as one of my girls. 

Additionally, another secretary, who we'll call Daisy (24F), has continuously rejected my attempts at supporting her and introducing her to new experiences and skills. She claims it's because she's married, but I fail to see the relevance as I am also married. She has also failed to fix my chair despite me asking her to do this for 6 weeks.

I have also been under a lot more stress because one of our new secretaries, Jody (33F) is struggling to pick up some of the basic office skills and cannot operate a printer correctly. She is recently divorced, which I acknowldge may be a reason for her continued distraction. It seems like she would forget her own name but I feel this is unfair for me to train or continuously support her as I have a business to run and cannot look after every single one of my employees, let alone train them. 

It seems now the girls in question have now all teamed up and seem to have plans remove me from the business. I feel this is unfair after all I have done for them, and the kindness I have showed them with my numerous positive comments and supportive nature. AITAH?",0,1757157086.0,AITAH,8,0.2,False

1n9wu92,https://i.redd.it/614gqmam1jnf1.jpeg,Vivian Luxury - Budget Indian house with best performance,"Perfume house: Vivian Luxury 

Quantity: 20 ml extrait de parfum 

Price: 300 to 350 per 20ml

Right at the time I developed a crippling addiction to buying fragrances, I watched a YouTube channel called ""Scent Saga"", he does this clone wars series with his wife and I found it to be refreshing and honest (Imo).

So I tried a few houses featured in those videos and one of them is Vivian Luxury.

Disclaimer: This isn't a glaze post, it's just my hobby to collect and talk about perfumes. (I wish someone paid me for low effort content lol) 

So I tried 6 perfumes, here's my review:

1. Le Elixir: Sweet, Vanillic, aromatic

This one is an inspiration of JPG Le male Elixir, but this ones less minty, slightly mellow and less aromatic. 

Smell:

It starts with a very sweet opening of Lavender, Vanilla and Mint. Pre maceration the mint felt synthetic, but after 2 months, its perfectly blended. 

This is the only le male Elixir rendition that doesn't overwhelm me with its opening. I have hawas elixir and its cloying with the mintyness. 

Mid is beautiful with the vanilla, lavender and honey combo. Kind of reminds me of axe dark temptation. 

Drydown is similar to middle notes. Hawas elixir has a better Drydown than this no doubt due to the use chocolate instead of honey (Personal preference). 

Unfortunately this one doesn't have that tobacco undertone like the original. 

This and hawas elixir are my signature night out frag. 

Performance:

Beast mode: Projects for 2 to 3 hours (Yes) 

Longevity 8 to 10 hours if you are wearing the clothes, 1 week if sprayed on idle clothes. 

I don't know if they used the UK queen's bath water or something but it lasts so long. 

9.5/10 for me

2. Ultra: Fruity, sweet, aromatic

This one's the best ultra male clone you can get (Way better than 9 pm) 

Smell:

Not much to explain here, its fruity and downright bubblegummy. 

Except its not synthetic like 9 pm or ramz silver. 

This smells just like a creamy yet mellow version of boomer or Big babool. Vanilla blended so well, I couldn't tell it apart. 

Performance:

This one's good, projects for 1.5 to 2 hours. 

Lasts 7 to 9 hours plus. On idle clothes lasted for 2 days. 9 pm performs a little better as it's stronger. 

10/10 smell for me. 

3. Tropical bliss - Citrusy, coconutty, Tropical

I got this one thinking this is a clone of Le beau le parfum, but apparently its a clone of Le beau EDT but on steroids.

Smell:

It opens with a blend of citrus and coconut oil/water and a hint of vanilla. There's also some kind of fruit like pineapple in there too. 

Pre maceration it was a bit fishy on my skin, but now its gone. 

Gives a very oily tropical feeling (Think about drinking lemonade in kerala while being oiled up with coconut oil) 

Drydown is creamy but this one doesn't dry for a long time. 

I am not a big fan of this DNA, I like the parfum better.

Performance:

Beast mode, Projects 4 hours (Yes), don't use beyond 5 sprays. 

Lasts 24 hours even if you wear it and sweat. Didn't try on idle clothes as its a room filler. 

6.5/10 (Just not for me) 

4. Phantom - Dark, warm, sweet

This is a 80% clone of black phantom, I did own a 2 ml decant and I can confirm. Except this is a bit muted, barely boozy and, extra woody and less sweet. Like a slightly synthetic nutella thats Heavy on nuts

Smell:

This starts with a nutty, vanilla, caramel opening. 

It doesn't overwhelm you at all, not gourmandish but mellow. 

Then the coffee and chocolate creep in silently and blend so well together. Dry down is a mix of nice sandalwood and hint of earthiness. 

This is a gentleman worthy sweet fragrance imo. 

It isn't boozy enough, that's why it's not a perfect clone. 

Layers so well with other gourmands. 

Performance:

This one's great, projects 2 to 3 hours medium

Lasts 9 to 10 hours, potentially longer in cold weather. 

10/10

5. Pacific chill - Citrusy, fruity, fresh

This is inspired from LV pacific chill, but I don't think this one's close. 

Smell:

Infact if you need a most natural rendition of pacific chill that smells like fresh orange, lemon juice mixed with minty extract and a hint of apricot, this one's perfect. 

This one doesn't have the depth of pacific chill or west coast from ababel. 

But this one is natural and refreshing. 

Performance:

Very weak, projects 30 mins. 

Lasts 4 hours max, in high heat 2 hours max. 

This one can be improved a lot but I still like its natural feeling. Performance makes it hard to recommend. 

7/10

6. Imagination - Fresh, Citrusy, Soapy

Imagination clone obviously 

Smell:

This ones also not close for me in terms of smell, its slightly off in the soapy and ginger area. Tea is also not prominent. Pretty citrus heavy. 

Performance:

Decent, it projects for 1 to 1.5 hours

Longevity is great, this is the only clone in this dna that lasts an entire day, I wore this to run errands, came back and left my shirt in the hanger and it lasted till the next day. 

Still 7/10 because I like another clone better so gave it to cousin. 

House rating: Solid 9/10 for me. 

This is the best performing budget Indian house perfume range for me. Sure they have some misses on clone accuracy but potent blends and performance doesn't make sense for those prices at all, too good. 

Caution: Their Extraits are a bit oily, so not sure if it's skin friendly, I didn't get any skin issues. I haven't tried these on pure white clothes tho. 

I don't care if scent saga is a paid promoter or if he gets free frags for review, it was from his videos I found gems like Vivian and ababel. 

Still Vivian can improve in Branding, marketing and innovation, considering how good their customer service is. 

You probably never heard about this house, but give it a shot, you won't regret buying. 

Thanks for reading this long ahhh review.  (I only have master perfumer and couple of perfumes from Arabian aroma left to review in Indian houses)

1n9wtxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n9wtxb/aitah_for_publicly_shaming_my_wife_for_falling/,AITAH for publicly shaming my wife for falling for a romance scam,"Wife(46F) and I(54M) have been through some challenges, I had a serious health issues that took a few years to recover from, stress of work, aging and life leading to a “flat” marriage. We had been through many challenges in the past, but a significant shift started about 10 months ago. 
She began to simply not do any of her responsibilities, became secretive, changed passwords and codes- and although we never policed each other in 25 years, these were open- email, phones, cards, etc- I never once opened the door to look, but we both knew the door was unlocked if wanted.

Her arguing became more and more difficult to comprehend, irrational anger and then if I responded she would secretly record me, edit out her instigation. She even shared videos to my daughter(33F), and other friends. 
To give an example, she basically cut off all contact with my daughter when my daughter said “I don’t know, he sounds like he’s the level headed one in this, and you’re being a bit irrational”. 
She even tried multiple times to instigate a physical altercation. At no point, ever, not now and not ever have I ever even considered raising a hand to her. It’s actually inconceivable to me. 

I was well aware of the red flags- hiding, sneaking off, hiding her phone when I came in the room. Then small weird banking issues. A hundred here a hundred there, then more. Like I say I never policed her, I trusted her implicitly for over 2 decades.
When I raised some questions about the banking, there were excuses, but then she started using her visa rather than the account. I don’t get her statements or open her mail. Anyways how it ended up was she started pulling high interest loans and washing through her visa, to whatever end, and dumping the loan repayments onto the primary account. And they all hit like an avalanche. Then the account was locked because she tried a large transfer to a bitcoin exchange, and the bank intervened.

At this point I’m reeling from being hit by one bus after another, and I’m still the “bad guy”- I made her move to the country (not exactly, she actually found the place we bought 19 years ago and suggested it to me), I’m “verbally abusive”, I’ll make no excuses- I said some mean stuff in the last while, I’m “distant”, etc.

I move out to my office- it’s a separate building- with the agreement I could make food, coffee, use facilities as needed.
I happen to be in the kitchen making coffee and her phone is sitting face up with case open on the counter, she has pathologically kept it hidden, controlled for months so I’m somewhat surprised it’s there, and as I’m pouring the coffee a long “I love you….” message pops up on it. 
I snap a pic with my phone, look up the name and find the profile of a guy who “lives” near where she’s been asking me to take out an equity loan so she could go back to school. A friend digs (I’m blocked by her on all social media platform by this point), and she has squishy cooing posts going back months under “his” pictures. 
I confront her on this. First response is “I’ve only been chatting a few days or week, and we are not together now and I can do what I want”, I bring up the screen shots of the posts and it becomes “okay maybe a month or so, but it was just harmless flirting”. As I peel back layer after layer it’s well over 6 months. After putting it together I ask outright- the bitcoin thing- where did that come from… “Him”… and these ideas “Him”…. On and on.

But prior- I blew it up. Online, with her family, mutual friends. A complete carpet bombing to see what rats scurried out of the rubble.
A mutual friend (female) dug in fast and determined clearly it was a scammer/catfish/fake - she even found the sister of the real guy who’s profile was stolen and this is not the first time this happened.

 A week passes and she asks if I will come back into the house-but says “I don’t know if I’m ready for a decision as to if we try to go forward”. My response was “you think this is all your decision? I wouldn’t trust you with a stale loaf of bread”, and “there is no way I will lay in a bed as some placeholder while you online shop for my replacement next to me”.

She keeps saying it wasn’t real, he wasn’t real. But, the intention was, the damage was. That’s real to me. 
The months of gaslighting and making me doubt my own sanity is real, the hurt and confusion was real.

I even said, just be open with it all. Put it on the table. And she continued to lie about how long, as mentioned above, it was peeling back layers like an onion with a new layer hidden underneath, with each new revelation moving the start back further and further.
She’s still lying about things.

Now I’m getting flack from some friends and local acquaintances that I was too harsh, too public, too mean about my response and how I “ demeaned and embarrassed” her, and could have done it privately.

Now I am the AH again, because I publicly “shamed and demeaned her” and that I won’t let it “go”.

So, AITAH?",15,1757156873.0,AITAH,26,0.89,False
1n9wtiq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9wtiq,Gear Review,"Yesterday I went out to the woods and learned a few things. 

I had packed my Kantamus with somewhere between 12-15kg, could've been a bit more. It wasnt super heavy, but it had some weight to it definitely. And it's been some talk about ventilation and I'm surprised how good it actually managed to keep my back not soaked. I took a cheap cotton t shirt simply to use as a measurement of wet spots. The t shit was overall very damp, but on the picture you can see it was mostly spots at my lower back where the back padding sits. Inside I use the new sit pad. I barely noticed wearing the pack, so it carries very well. Happy with that! 

The sit pad: damn, I actually found great use for it. It's comfy to sit on, big enough to sit on, works excellent as a ""door step"" to your tent, which makes putting on pants easier and/or to rest your feet outside of the tent if it's a smaller tent like mine (bivvy tent). Also it doubles as a ""table"". When the ground is uneven, putting down a beer or something else just makes it more worth it.

Always carry your head torch on your person. I went out quite late and decided to explore a part of the woods I haven't seen before. It gets dark FAST. And it's quite the pain to pull out a bunch of stuff from the top lid to get it out, especially when it's fully packed. Usually I have it either around my neck or in a pant pocket, but I didn't this time. 

Walking sticks/Trekking Poles: god damn, it was wet and slippery and a overall messy terrain to walk through, especially in dark. I'm so glad I brought them since I've barely used them before. Jumping over obstacles made it so much easier, and helps from slipping and noticing how the ground feels before you step there. 

Taking out your bearing before you walk away. I'm so happy I did this, so when I had to return when being too close to wild boars and it was pitch black, I had at least a general direction to follow so I could get back to my car and pitch the tent and tarp. Yesterday was the first time I almost crashed into a family of boars or even seeing a live one (I know right) and all I know is that they're dangerous if they feel threatened, especially when they got the kiddos. 

I didn't bring a compass, but I had my Garmin, so that helped a lot. It was also way colder than I expected but I didn't freeze, but in the morning it took one of my to Plastex canteens and boiled up some water for coffee and to fill the canteen and help warm my sleeping bag up and also frying my cotton t shirt which still was very moist even when it was with me in the sleeping bag all night. Wrapping the hot canteen with the t shirt so I got a somewhat even layer around it dried it up fast. ",13,1757156832.0,Savotta,2,1.0,False

One of my coworkers (who is closest in seniority to me) is incredibly draining. 

He interrupts me multiple times a day with “hey stupid question”
And then will proceed to actually ask me something ridiculous. When I give my response he then debates it and suggests an alternative. This will keep going until I get frustrated and semi snap at him telling him to do whatever he feels will work. He will then appear hurt and later seems to try to somehow win me back by offering tea/coffee/cake etc leaving me feeling guilty and then I start over functioning trying to make up for the whole interaction (as I understand my anger given my position would feel quite threatening for him which is not what I want).

 An example:
Him: “Hey stupid question, should I speak to A or B regarding this task”
Me: “oh I usually speak to B”
Him: “well on the one hand A would make more sense because of X Y Z”
Me: “oh ok do A then if that’s what you want to do”
Him: “but then I think B would be better because of A B C “
Me: “well then choose whichever one you want I guess?”
Him: “I just feel the issue with choosing A is 123”
Me: “ok”
Him: “the thing about B though is 8,9,10”
Me (irritated, disengaging and turning back to computer): “pick whichever one you want thanks” 

I’m not exaggerating at all. He has done this about anything from work related tasks to where he should get lunch to whether he should ask someone if they should join the team for coffee, as well as sometimes offering unsolicited debates about tasks that I’m doing (maybe you should do this but maybe you should do this but maybe).

He is very polite, by the book and hardworking however and also as I said feels berated by my shut downs (and given my position as a senior will then try to ease things) though doesn’t take any hints or simple requests to decide on his own. 

I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t seem like he can take direct feedback about this given his response to me thus far. 

Help! I’ve never had an issue like this before. I have another junior colleague who is work avoidant and it is so much easier than this to manage. I’m scared I’m going to snap and say something I’ll regret so any advice would be appreciated! ",10,1757156605.0,managers,28,0.92,False

**3+ Months before surgery** 

*  Work on your prehab and get your body as strong and light as possible. Work with a physio on a plan: I myself been doing the prep work for almost a year; focusing on single leg exercises, core stability and arms strength.  

* Take a look at your contacts for people who may have moved to the country you're going to. I thought I had no one in Cambridge but found out 3 ex-coworkers living there. It's good to have friends around. 

**1 Month before surgery**

* Book a hotel-apartment, not a hotel or AirBnB. You need a place with a kitchenette, a living room and a bedroom but provides hotel-like services like house keeping. NOTES: 1) ask the hotel for accessible rooms - make sure the bathroom is walk in, not tub; 2) make sure the fridge is big. Do not take a place with a mini fridge! 3) the location and distance from the hospital doesn't matter, I opted for a place next to a park and some nature so that I can get out) 4) make sure there's a microwave
* Buy all the tools you will need (toilet sear raiser (there's a travel version); grabber; long shoe horn, foot lifter and a high cushion that would give you 3-5 inches extra)
* Buy optional accessories: bumbag, 2x cold packs (to use in rotation), foldable bed study table, small backpack)
* If you're a hairy man like me, wax your legs and bum! It will make cleaning yourself easier as water will just slide off your body. Do this at the 30 day mark not later.
* Reorganise your home for post-surgery protocol - practice sitting on your sofa/chair without breaking the 90 degrees protocol - anything you would change? Is there's anything in the lower drawers that you use often? move it to the top 
* Register in a meal-prep plan for overseas - have it delivered in two batches to keep it fresh. Have the first delivery one day before surgery 
* If you're serious about your coffee, pack a mokapot/french press
* Optional: pack your gaming console! definitely ask first about the TV if it has HDMI 
* Ask if the hospital has a raised toilet. Mine said they will not provide any so I packed my own. But later realised the actually offer one
* Pack your clothes as if you are not going to do laundry i.e., clothes for every day. Unless the apartment has a washing machine. Pack shoes that you know you can slip in/out of quickly without having to tie.
* If you're on insurance or the hospital stay is cheap, ask your doctor if you can stay 2-3 extra days in there. I was grateful for all the support I got from the nursing team
* Call the Airline and inform them that you need help in your inbound travel. I flew with Emirates and they looked after me 


**1 week before surgery**

* Arrive 2-3 days before the surgery; inspect the room for any risks and re organise the furniture so that it's comfortable when you return. For example, there were no high seats/chairs so I reassembled the couch and made it sit higher. I also pulled a high table towards the couch and moved the coffee table and rug away

* Befriend hotel staff: make sure you tip and you're always nice to them - you will need them a lot!

* Connect the toilet seat raiser; add a chair in the bathroom for something to hold on it if needed

* Prepare your bed and living area: 2x chargers, a pissing bottle next to bed (sorry), a water bottle, tissue, plastic bag for trash

* Buy groceries: Water (If you cannot drink tap water in this country, then make sure you buy enough water for 3 liters/day, ground coffee, healthy and not-so-healthy snacks, 3x wet-wipes for toilet, living area and bedroom

* Optional: if the country you're in has legalised weed, get some and pre-roll joints, I heard edibles are even better

* Take your laptop with you to the hospital! I watched sports and movies all day


**Surgery week**

* Put all the pill reminders and workout reminders in your phone's calendar 
* When you return to the hotel, ask your Uber driver if he would help you with your luggage and tip them
* Same with hotel staff, ask for help to get to your room and tip
* Get on the workouts asap but don't over do it


**Returning home**

* When you book your Uber to the airport make sure it's an XL kind and have cash for a heavy tip. Tell the driver upfront that you will need help getting the luggage up to the ticketing counter, the airline will takeover from there...
* Have your cushion and meds in your carry-on in case the seat is low
* Try to go to the toilet before leaving the hotel, nothing worst than having to go to toilet in an airplane let alone in crutches!",1,1757156194.0,TotalHipReplacement,1,1.0,False

I tried to laugh it off & block them, but they follow me from like, going on three dozen accounts. I blocked those but they just made more.

They made a regular slew of hate posts accusing me of liking them & not being able to admit it despite my firm no thanks to dating this person. They did it because they saw on my profile I’m a rape victim who likes to help inform other women they have a right to fight back too. They have some strange beliefs, that a violently struggling & angry woman who gets forced into sex she doesn’t want secretly enjoys it & looked to push that narrative despite any reality displaying the contrary. This isn’t about truth to them, this is about their projection of how they’d want the victim to be treated when &/or if they rape somebody. I’m always keenly aware of that. 


They showed up at my home, I had to change my phone number because they wouldn’t stop contacting me. This person is just completely detached from any normal reality of socially decent behavior for an adult. My parents say he’s so mentally ill that he can’t make heads or tails of how to behave in a way that allows him to navigate society without being a criminal menace. 

We called the police, we called the Feds, we called counselors, we called a detective, we called victim’s advocates. We lived for a year or so with the knowledge that because we hadn’t managed to catch them they could just show up again with a weapon & we wouldn’t know & the police wouldn’t be able to intervene until this person was physically on our door step. 

So I sent cease & desists when we finally found out who did it. Four over the course of about a year. 

The first was met with verbal abuse. I included evidence, I offered the household condolences, rather than condemn I asked that they try to get this person some intensive psychological help. The response was more death threats & this person laughing at bruises on my body the police have them under investigation for. Last I knew they need to subpoena this person’s work logs to match the time frames. They got a friend of theirs who likes to talk about how funny it is to hit women threaten to assault me. 

All I said was “hey, please stop”. 

I waited a few months to see if things calmed down, they didn’t, this person still threatened & harassed me, they contacted me on social media. They posted about me. They made up rumors to try to hurt me because they were angry I said please stop. 

When I said for them to stop these two abusive cave goblins laughed in my face, told me I’d have to call the police to stop them, said they’re not the cops so they don’t have to desist when told to please desist because they think not criminally targeting a woman who just doesn’t like them is simping. 

Then when I finally called the police because the harassment didn’t stop they started screaming & crying I was threatening them. 

A criminal threat is threatening to do criminal activity to somebody. It’s not any message that hurts this person’s feelings. It’s not this person is mad he tried to threaten & scare a woman into a relationship & then accused them of being sexually arouses by the abuse when she says no (this person really did that to me & refuses to believe that the extreme porn available in sites like porn hub do not reflect the desires of the typical woman just existing & living out in the world). Publicly, posted verbally degrading content about me because I told him to please stop. 

This is all this person has ever done when I say stop, no thank you, ew, not into you stalker, any of it. They immediately jump to being sexually disgusting & aggressive. I hate it, I’ve made it clear I don’t consent to be spoken to in an explicit manner by this person & he’s so obviously hyper focused on his fetishization of sexual abuse & aggression towards women he can’t manage to comport himself in a manner that doesn’t constitute criminal. 

Then he sits & cries he shouldn’t be prosecuted for flirting. No he’s not flirting, flirting is trying to take a woman out for coffee & respecting her decision should she decide she’d prefer not to. This individual is verbally abusive & sexually dangerous, they genuinely hold a delusional false perception women want to be attacked & raped that they are not mentally wise &/or observant enough to see & understand as false. 

They sent unwanted explicit pics & rape threats anyway after the third cease & desist & when I tried again after filing for a restraining order I was met with death threats & verbal abuse. I didn’t do anything wrong to the best of my knowledge, I was polite, I was as cordial as I could be while trying to impress upon these horrible people that sexual harassment isn’t funny & isn’t boys being boys. It’s illegal, it’s a crime. I don’t know what else to think of a family that raises a son like *that* who thinks death & rape threats are a justified response to a polite “I’m not interested in you”. They were exactly what I feared they’d be, victim blaming, dishonest & manipulative people just like the person harassing me & my family. I didn’t ask for their mess of an evil family member to come try to hurt me because I just don’t feel interested in them. I am not criminally threatening them because I refuse to be strong armed by this person into dating them &/or their equally hateful deranged alt right cult. Saying please stop isn’t criminal &/or a threat. It’s saying please stop & I had multiple legal experts say this person & their camp attempting to punish me for saying no & stop might actually work against them more than help them. 

I am not criminally threatening these hateful people for calling the police after death & rape threats numbers 34-38, on camera. They posted videos on camera making death threats. I have it in writing they refused to stop unless I call the police. 


In all this their pathetic excuse is “you don’t admit to ignoring nice guys like me so I’m going to pretend I’m not doing anything to you”. No, you can’t threaten to rape & kill a woman & show up at her home because you think she doesn’t go for “nice guys like you”. You’re not nice, nice men don’t try to attack a woman both verbally & physically because she doesn’t want to go in a date. That’s delulu. This person is a bad person, open & shut case on that. 

Tl dr: psycho who showed up at my house after threatening to rape & kill me is trying to victim blame because I had to send multiple cease & desists. Is multiple cease & desists illegal??",1,1757155729.0,IsItIllegal,0,1.0,False

The St. Louis Cardinals (70-71) host the San Francisco Giants (71-69) in a September soap opera of strikeouts and slugging. Here’s what’s cooking:

### Key Stats & Odds

* **Moneyline**: Giants are underdogs at **-101**, while the Cardinals are your overpriced coffee at **-111**.
* **Spread**: Giants -1.5 (+160) vs. Cardinals -1.5 (-200). Bet the Giants to cover like they’re dodging a line drive.
* **Over/Under**: **8.5 runs** (-110/-110). With the Cardinals’ **4.27 ERA** and Giants’ **3.78 ERA**, this could be a bloodbath.

**Why the Giants Might Win**:  
Their pitching staff (6th-best ERA) will likely outperform the Cardinals’ **4.27 ERA** (20th-worst). The Giants’ offense averages **605 runs** (vs. Cardinals’ 613), but their starters are less likely to gift extra innings via walks (Cardinals’ pitching: **7.5 K/9**—ouch).

I bought the Dreame L40 Ultra AE with high expectations, but I have to say I’ve been deeply disappointed. I’ve had issues right from the start, beginning with the Wi-Fi setup: I had to change my router’s security settings to make it work, otherwise it wouldn’t connect. That alone was already a red flag for me.

But the real problems started with daily use. The robot seems to wander around the house without any logical pattern. I’ve observed it both with my own eyes and through the app’s map, and some things are just absurd. For example:

Issues with curtains: The app allows you to set “curtain zones,” but it doesn’t make any difference. The robot won’t go near or clean under the curtains, even though mine are raised about 1.5 cm off the ground.

Imprecise cleaning: It doesn’t clean well around the legs of chairs, the table, or near walls. It keeps a distance from objects like my cylindrical coffee table in the living room, leaving a gap of about 4 cm.

Problems with rugs: It doesn’t properly recognize my bamboo rug in the kitchen or the jute rug in the living room. When it does recognize them, it only cleans certain areas and ignores others beyond the rugs.

Bathroom and shower: It keeps bumping into the shower glass, even though there’s a 4 cm edge. I had to set up a no-go zone to stop it from trying, but it’s ridiculous that it can’t handle such a simple situation.

Floor mirror: The robot “sees” beyond the mirror and invents a nonexistent room. There’s no way to delete it in the app, so I had to create another no-go zone.

Door issues: If I want it to clean behind a door, the robot never goes back to finish that area unless I manually intervene.

The app is another weak point: it’s not user-friendly, and the settings are poorly organized. I’ve tried different cleaning modes, but even the “Clean Genius” mode doesn’t solve the main issues.

To give you some context, my old Roborock from 2019 did a much better job in terms of both mapping and cleaning—it was also much faster, even just in the vacuuming phase, while this Dreame seems particularly slow in its cleaning sessions. This Dreame, on the other hand, feels like a step backward in every way.

What frustrates me the most is that I paid €600 for it, only to find out that a few months ago it was on sale for €400. It’s absolutely not worth the price I paid.

Now I’m unsure what to do. Should I go back to Roborock? If so, which model would you recommend? Or are there other emerging brands that offer better performance? I’ve read positive reviews about Dreame, but honestly, I don’t understand how that’s possible. I suspect they’re running a really aggressive online marketing campaign, because I’ve mostly found glowing reviews on both YouTube and Amazon, and that seems suspicious given my direct experience. This doubt about their marketing tactics is important to me and makes me even more skeptical.

Has anyone had similar experiences or suggestions for a robot vacuum that’s actually worth buying? I’m open to any advice!

I need to know if I’m being too calculative or if my gut’s right.

So it was a 5D4N trip to Perth with Ally (one of my closest friends for almost a decade) and Karen (a colleague-turned-friend I bonded with over food and complaining about work). I was excited to celebrate Ally’s new job, but Karen gave me so many red flags that I honestly don’t think I can continue this friendship.

For context: I’ve lived in Perth before, I’ve done a ton of road trips, and I’m particular about not driving after sunset (dark, dangerous, plus everything closes early). Ally is easy-going, Karen doesn’t drive. Yet Karen kept insisting on attractions 5+ hours away when we only had a short trip. I stood firm, explained why, and we compromised: no driving after 6pm.

First ick: right after landing, I suggested a quick supermarket run for water and snacks before our 3h drive. I grabbed a sandwich, coffee, water. Karen said she didn’t need anything… then proceeded to order food and made us wait so she could eat it hot, despite me telling her to just eat in the car since she wasn’t driving/navigating.

Food issue #1: We agreed beforehand to share mains to avoid food waste. Every dinner, Karen ignored our suggestions, ordered whatever she wanted, and we ended up with too much food and desserts Ally and I didn’t even want. She’d pressure Ally to “just take a bite” so she could split desserts.

Food issue #2: She insisted on cooking one night. Ally and I grabbed simple things: instant noodles, eggs, butter, pancakes. Karen? A random assortment of veggies, potatoes, chicken thighs, two litres of chicken stock “because it’s cheaper”, plus rice. Half the stuff went in the bin.

Time issue: One morning, we planned to leave at 9. I woke at 6:30, packed, made breakfast, coffee, everything. Ally was ready by 8:30. Karen waltzed out at 9:20 saying, “Oh, I thought we were leaving at 10.” The itinerary was on an Excel sheet we all had.

Last straw: Another grocery run. Ally grabbed spinach, I grabbed shrimp and fruit. Karen turned up with steaks, broccolini, ANOTHER pack of instant noodles (??), a box of chocolates, and a chocolate bar. I noticed on the Splitwise bill she charged all of it to us—including her $8.50 chocolate bar. When I called her out, she “forgot” and only deducted the bar, not the whole box of chocolates.

And then she had the cheek to ask why dinner was $60 when we were eating in. GIRL, it’s your steak and chocolate!! And the extra pack of instand noodles you brought home!!!!

Final ick: We used Splitwise to track expenses. I even paid for Pro so we could convert currencies properly. She actually questioned whether I was calculating exchange rates correctly—even though I used my CC and input the exact charges in home currency. For a ~$1k trip. Like???

By the time we got home, I realized I felt gross. Ally and I shared cabs since we live near each other, but Karen insisted on tagging along despite being out of the way and dropping her off first. It just feels like she milked us the entire trip.

So yeah… I’ve decided to cut Karen out. But now I’m wondering—AITAH for being calculative, or is she just cheap and inconsiderate?",1,1757155623.0,AITAH,14,0.6,False

We’re both white and originally not from New York. We moved here for school and have lived in this apartment for about a year.

Our building has a beautiful, classic stoop. Recently, Chloe has gotten really into what she calls ""stoop culture."" She bought expensive, colorful cushions for us to sit on, a little Bluetooth speaker, and a fancy thermos for her iced coffee. Three or four times a week, she'll spend the afternoon sitting on the stoop, reading a book, and waving to people.

The issue started last week. A few of our older neighbors, who have lived here for decades and always hang out on their own stoops, were having a conversation in Spanish. Chloe, who doesn't speak Spanish, sat on our stoop with her setup and tried to wave and smile at them. They gave her a polite nod but then kind of lowered their voices and eventually went inside.

Later, Chloe was complaining to me that she feels like the ""real locals"" are excluding her and that she’s ""just trying to build community."" She said she wanted to experience the authentic neighborhood vibe, and it felt like they were being cold.

This is where I might be the asshole. I told her that she isn’t experiencing ""stoop culture,"" she's performing a caricature of it. I said that sitting on a stoop is a natural part of life for people who have deep roots and family here, but when she does it with all her brand-new gear, it feels less like community and more like a tourist attraction she's setting up. I said her ""hobby"" is basically gentrification in disguise and it makes our neighbors, who are being priced out of their own community, uncomfortable. I pointed out that she’s treating their front yard like her personal coffee shop patio.

She completely lost it. She called me a self-hating, performatively ""woke"" asshole. She said she’s paying rent just like everyone else and has every right to sit on her own stoop, and that I was the one creating bad vibes by judging her. She claims I’m making assumptions about our neighbors and that I should be happy she’s trying to be friendly instead of staying locked in our apartment.

I feel like my point was valid, but the way I said it was harsh. Seeing her so upset made me wonder if I was out of line. I was just trying to explain how our actions might be perceived in a neighborhood that's rapidly changing, but maybe I was just being a jerk to my roommate.

My whole life I was suffering with severe IBS-D and was on low FODMAP diet for the past decade. 1,5 year ago I got Botox in to my cricopharyngeal sphincter for R-CPD (no burp syndrome), and within 4 months since I started burping I was completely cured of IBS. Turns out I'm not even lactose intolerant. I'm no longer on low FODMAP diet and became vegetarian. Now to poop I need to eat massive amounts of fiber rich foods...  I've gained weight and now, instead of being bloated with gas, I'm bloated with poop, and still only able to poop when the mass reaches it's limits, so like, every three days, with some tiny poops in-between on good days. Coffee is the only thing that helps(decaff doesn't) but I can't have it with ADHD meds, and on days off meds I can't have coffee more than 2 days in a row because I get very bad caffeine withdrawal head aches when I eventually need to take meds instead of coffee.


I know the pooping issues are from stretched and weakened bowel muscles, since it's a common complication from having R-CPD, and I also had bad IBS-D, so I was basically farting and pooping A LOT, which destroyed the muscles. I can often feel the poop wanting to get out, but I can't force it. The poop itself seems healthy when it finally does come out.


Additional difficulty is that I'm a picky eater, and also anxious about meds for constipation due to all the IBS suffering I lived through... The worst was when I had very painful IBS diarrhoea that wouldn't want to get out, causing hours of pain, before exploding... I'm scared that taking constipation medication might cause something similar.


Being able to burp has definitely improved my life a lot, I'm no longer short of breath, nauseous and unwell after meals. My hiccups are no longer painful, and I think I would even be able to puke if I needed to (not confirmed, cuz I didn't need to puke). But it added a new difficulty that I wasn't expecting... The specialist who did the Botox said that my IBS might get better, but I didn't really took it too seriously back then, and didn't know that having healthy poops instead of liquidy could become and issue.


I tried psyllium husks, but I didn't work at all, and I was scared it will make me allergic to pollen if taken long term, so I decided it wasn't worth trying to make it work.


R-CPD is not well known amongst the doctors, so I'm afraid my GP will approach it like constipation with actuall hard little poops, which isn't the case for me (when I was taking wrong Iron pills it was, so I do know how that looks like).

The last day doesn’t really count though, because nobody is allowed to win on the final stage — it’s basically just a parade where the overall winner gets to keep a yellow T-shirt as their prize.

This yellow T-shirt has been worn by countless sweaty men over the past 123 years, making it possibly the smelliest piece of clothing in Europe. The “awful drip” is legendary, and yet it’s still considered better than anything Kanye has released.

The competition is fierce. All male riders are obsessed with looking as thin and smooth as possible, like a bunch of competitive ballerinas. They shave every hair off their bodies, then brag about it while sipping their liquid toddler food (coffee, gels, and mystery goo in plastic tubes). Real food is for amateurs.

The bikes themselves are more expensive than most second-hand cars, and when they break, riders just chuck them into a ditch like old toys. Instead of fixing them, they wait for their friends in fancy team cars to drop off a new one. These cars carry up to 8 bikes on the roof and altogether are worth more than £100,000, which is basically a rolling insurance scam.

Speaking of insurance, most professional teams are named after supermarkets or insurance companies. This isn’t random — it’s because when riders inevitably crash at 70 km/h, the payouts are almost as impressive as the road rash. Luckily, they usually hop back on their bikes as if nothing happened, just to annoy every driver whose road has been closed for hours.

The racing itself is hilarious. They ride for 5 hours straight, sweating and suffering, only for the winner to be decided in the final 30 seconds. The best riders manipulate their own teammates to do all the hard work, then sprint past them at the end. Selfish? Yes. Effective? Also yes.

The fans are no less peculiar. They stand on the roadside all day, unemployed and sunburned, just to watch the peloton zoom past for 10 seconds. At home, it’s even worse: people stare at the TV for 6 hours of scenery, pretending to care about sheep in the French Alps. Fans are either young twenty-somethings convinced they’ll “go pro one day” or retirees in their 60s wearing Lycra tighter than their skin.

Tradition plays a role too. Farmers often block the roads with cows or tractors, forcing the French police to act like cowboys. Before the riders even arrive, a “caravan” of sponsor floats throws free hats, candy, and occasionally stale sandwiches at the crowd, which is honestly the best part of the day.

The jerseys have their own stories. The polka-dot jersey for the best climber came about when a sponsor mixed up the laundry with grandma’s curtains. The green jersey is supposedly for sprinting but in reality goes to the rider who eats the most Haribo. And the time trial skin suit? That’s not for speed, it’s just to see how ridiculous a human body can look in spandex.

The history of winners is equally dubious. The rider who technically “won the most” cheated every single time, but cycling fans still consider him “the GOAT.” Meanwhile, Welsh cycling has produced exactly one successful rider, whose obsession with white sunglasses ended in tragedy when he lost them (and his mind) in a crash.

Culturally, the Tour de France is the only thing most Americans know about France — apart from the world wars. And while the race claims to be international, it mostly discriminates against Asians, Africans, or anyone not from Western Europe.

At the end of it all, the overall winner doesn’t just get the yellow T-shirt — they also receive a lifetime supply of bananas and the right to honk at Paris roundabouts without consequences.

The material below is oriented towards women, but it can apply equally to men as well. 

I hope you find it helpful.
___

I cannot count the number of stories I've read here on this website by women (and by a few men) who feel invisible in their relationships, are anxious and depressed, who **know** that something is wrong... yet who talk about how utterly extraordinary their boyfriends / partners / husbands are.

* And because these women perceive these partners to be fully functional, these woman are willing to tolerate all sorts of mistreatment... in fact, these women often wonder *[what it is that they are doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l5xe86/why_do_so_many_women_doubt_themselves/)* to cause their partners to emotionally abuse them, ridicule and ignore them, dismiss them and treat them like they have no thoughts or feelings of their own.
* Like they are a coffee table, or perhaps a chair.  
* Not a complex, sensitive human being with her own inner emotional and psychological existence.

And it would never occur to these women to question whether they should be in their relationship in the first place, because that would mean that they'd have to summon up the courage to reject and walk away from the neglect which, for all the world, they seem to be [completely comfortable](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l4z4rb/how_our_childhood_experiences_shape_us_as_adults/) with -- because they do not recognize it as neglect in the first place.
___

These posts -- about four dozen of which I read yesterday alone -- will usually start out thusly:

* *My husband and I've been married for six years, and he is truly the most amazing man I've ever been with... he has a good job, he sometimes does his own laundry, and he even took time off from online gaming (his passion!) when I was sick this week to help our oldest child with her homework.*
* *My boyfriend is a very good man -- hardworking, good to his dogs, usually goes with me when I visit my parents, and will even drive me to appointments when my car is broken if I ask him nicely.* 
* *I'm dating this AMAZING guy!  He is so sweet, and gentle and earns a great income (five times more than me!) ... he will even offer to treat me once in while when we go out together to do things.  He also does not look at me or say much to me when we do go out, but I assume that is how all guys are.*
* *No one has ever treated me better than the guy I am with -- he's responds to my texts pretty quickly, has a great job, and will sometimes even help me with the dishes even if I'm exhausted from taking care of our baby all day.*
___

Then, as their narrative develops and these women add details to their posts, it becomes acutely, indeed, painfully evident that they are suffering immensely, and they are not sure why.

* The leitmotif in their stories -- always / always hidden deep between the lines of their prose (because, presumably, it is simply too painful for them to acknowledge and openly express what it is that they are **in fact** feeling) --  is that they are being undervalued, unappreciated, ignored, and treated as though they are worthless.

They talk about ""rough patches"" that ""everyone must go through"" and remark that while everything seems right, there is something going on that is bothering them... but they simply cannot identify what it is.

All that they know is that something *doesn't feel right* to them, and they ask others on Reddit what it is that they *should be feeling.*

* One remarked (and I paraphrase): ""Sometimes I look at the Instagram posts of my best girlfriend, and I see her doing all sorts of things with her boyfriend, and they seem so happy in their photos... he buys her flowers and even takes her out to dinner sometimes, and I once asked my SO if he would do that with me and he said he might if he had time.  But I know he's super busy with his job so I don't bring it up.  What should I feel about this?""
___

Put simply, the women above are all reporting that their partners ""show up.""

The Oxford English Dictionary defines ""showing up"" as ""arriving or turning up for an appointment or gathering.""

* In other words, ""showing up"" is doing the bare minimum *required* of a person.

And that is precisely what these guys above are doing: the ***bare minimum*** that they, the guys, believe is *required* of them: they have a job (usually), they come home after work (usually), they watch tv with their wives or girlfriends (usually), they might even spend time together on the weekends.  

And so on and so forth.

* In other words, these guys are acting exactly in the way that they *think* a guy *should* act to keep a relationship alive, and to satisfy a partner.
* And these women think that a guy who does what he, the guy, himself thinks is the way he should act -- in other words, the bare minimum to keep a woman as a partner -- is not only an acceptable basis for maintaining a relationship, but *for tolerating all the other things that are missing in that relationship.*

Or worse, tolerating behaviors that the women themselves *know full well* are [red flags](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1m3sqgc/red_flags_to_watch_out_for_when_dating/)... indeed, that **they knew** were red flags before they became involved with the guy in the first place.

* For the simple reason that the women know, in their minds and hearts, that behaving in such a way is not the way they believe they should be treated. 
* Perhaps because these women would never, ever treat another human being in such a fashion.
___

So why do these men behave the way that they do, and why to these women tolerate this sort of behavior from their partners -- indeed, rationalize it to the point where the women become anxious and depressed?

Everyone is different, and all situations of course are also different, and it is therefore impossible to know with any certainty what is going on in the relationships above.

And there are always two sides to a story... and obviously we are all reading one account.

* Having said that, there is a *uniformity, a consistency, a predictability* in and to the accounts provided by every woman (and the men who find themselves in similar situations with their women partners) who posts here.
* The details may be sightly different, **but the theme is always the same.**
* (And it is on that basis that I *personally* regard as credible most every account posted by a woman that I read here on this website.  For the simple reason that they ring true and are all more or less the same.)
___

Anyway, it is on that \^ basis -- the uniformity of all the thousands of diverse accounts shared by women here -- that one can reasonably conclude that everything that is happening in these relationships stem from the individual [childhood experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l4z4rb/how_our_childhood_experiences_shape_us_as_adults/) of the men and women involved.

* These men and women, as small children, grew up in homes where they carefully observed the behavior of their own parents.
* They also absorbed, like little sponges, the feelings and emotions of their parents -- the aggression, the disrespectful attitude, the subservience, the tolerance of what to any objective observer would clearly represent inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors.
* And of course, as children, they were too young to understand what it was that they were absorbing and observing -- all of which was being etched into their mind's unconscious.
___

Put simply, the guys mentioned above were merely behaving more or less as their fathers had.

And the women above were accepting and tolerating those behaviors -- because their own mothers had done so.

* There was no one around to tell the mothers of the women mentioned above that they, the moms, were entitled to expect more from their own husbands than just ""showing up.""
(And by the same token, no one was around to tell the boys that their fathers were not behaving suitably.)
* And the women above, *like their own moms*, knew that what was going on was not right... yet they stayed in their marriages or relationships, year after year after year, because they, their own mothers, had no one to tell *them* that what they were putting up with was unacceptable.
* And the anxiety and depression that the women above saw in their own mothers became an acceptable way to live.  Same idea of course applied to the boys. 
* For the simple reason that the moms in question never had the courage to acknowledge what it is that **they themselves** were feeling.  
* Any more than the fathers in question thought for a single second about their own behavior.
___

The reason I share the thoughts above is because I [personally endured neglect and abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/s/ERQ9FbCHGD) in my 24 year marriage, and I understand full well why it is that people remain in unhealthy relationships. 

I contribute now on this website to share my experiences, so that men and women alike can begin to understand why they behave, react, and perceive reality the way that they do.

Women are mistreated and abused in relationships, as are men.

And to my mind there is simply no reason to accept such a state of affairs.

And it is by understanding why we behave the way we do, and why we accept the unacceptable behavior of others, that we can begin to set [boundaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1mut7wb/some_examples_of_my_relationship_boundaries/) for ourselves and make choices that are in our own best interests.

I took my first dose yesterday (2.5mg). Soon after, developed burping, skin sensitivity all over (primarily in trunk, neck and arms), fatigue, and this sense of extreme fullness in my stomach.

The fullness is the thing that’s getting me. I had 1 protein bar at 8:00am yesterday, a few sips of coffee and then 1.5 cups of Fairlife throughout the evening despite feeling super full.

It’s now been 24h and the feeling is still persisting. I can’t describe it better than it feels like I drank a smoothie and it’s just … stuck. Has anyone had this experience? When did you notice it going away?

It’s uncomfortable to the point of me waking up in the middle of the night.

1n9wal5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1n9wal5/aio_bf_doesnt_learn_my_love_language/,AIO: Bf doesn’t learn my love language,"My bf and I have been together for almost a year now. Whenever we see each other, he would always pay for almost everything. But there are times where I would volunteer to pay for it. We’re in LDR right now and it’s hard to send gifts to each other because we both live in different countries.

But even if we’re in LDR, I still find a way to send him something during special occasions (birthday, monthsary, etc). I would always do my research because giving him gifts (food, flowers, etc) is something I want to do for him. Because I want to take care of him.

Sometimes I also want him to send me food and flowers because that’s how I feel loved? He only sent me a food once and after that he didn’t. And he did it because we had a fight. But after that he never tried to send me food or even flowers. He would always say that he would send me some stuff but he never did. I never demand him to send me food and flowers because I’m working and I can buy it myself. 

But ig I also want to be get taken care of? Like I want him to send me flowers too (because that’s what I did for his bday). And I sent a flower on his birthday because he never received one and it’s my gift for him. But am I the asshole if I also expect him to do that to me?

I kinda feel like it’s unfair because I go out of my way to find ways to send him some stuff. But he doesn’t find ways to take care of me (even if it’s just a donut, burger or coffee during rough days). 

Now, I asked him to buy me food because I’m too tired to cook. Because he told me to be honest if I need something. And I should just tell him what I want. And he said “no”. And I got sad? Like I want to get taken care of once in a while. I don’t know how to express my feelings because I see other guys who would voluntarily do those type of stuff without being told by their gfs. And I want to experience that too because I feel like if a “person” does that it means that they really care about me.

For more context: he’s the one who would always visit me because I’m not earning well. But I’m surviving for now. He also pays for our food when we’re together. So I feel like I might be the bad person here? I feel like I have no right to demand sometimes because he always pay for the stuff when we’re together.

Collected daughter from Stansted airport last night and it was a horrible experience:
Driving in to the airport. the standard of driving was bad; a combination of those in a panicked hurry and the confused who had no idea where to go. This was not helped by poor signage: the signs on the way in covered by bushes, poor signage on the roads. 
Parking: the “elbows out” attitude of some of the drivers - lack of consideration for anyone else, just an “I have to be first” attitude. Then the price of the parking, only revealed when you get to the barrier. My daughter’s transit to the airport from the aircraft was delayed by a medical emergency. Not anybody’s fault, but it pushed the parking over an hour. £22 for that parking, and over £5 for a coffee whilst waiting. It is not like Stansted is built on prime land, so what costs are you covering for with the extortionate parking charges? It is just to rip people off: to make profit. 
Sitting, waiting at arrivals was gloomy. Wobbly, dirty tables strewn with litter, uncomfortable chairs, unattractive environment. With the litter: there were bins there for people to put their litter in, but was it the self-entitlement of people “someone else will clear up after me”, or was it a protest at the inflated prices they had to pay? There was a guy checking the bins. Plenty of room in them, he was doing his job well. Well done. Why not have a couple of people tidying up too, cleaning tables, putting the tables and chairs straight, improving the environment?",1,1757154668.0,BrokenEngland,0,1.0,False

1n9w71u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9w71u,"Celebrity Apex – Norwegian Fjords & Arctic Circle (First-Time, Solo Cruiser)","TL;DR: Fantastic first solo cruise on Celebrity Apex. Great cabin and service, MDR food consistently excellent, entertainment good though some shows fill up early, excursions better booked independently, Premium Access worth it, and the Northern Lights were the highlight. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quality, not overly “party” style cruise.

⸻

Room

I stayed in a solo infinite veranda cabin. The room was well-appointed with plenty of storage. I asked for extra hangers and got loads. There is space under the bed to slide a large suitcase out of the way, which was handy.

The cabin was cleaned twice a day by my attendant, Michael, who was amazing. Within a couple of days, he understood my schedule and adjusted his service around it. One night, I asked him how to get an ice bucket for a bottle of champagne. He asked when I wanted it, and when I returned from the theatre later that evening, my champagne was waiting on ice with two flutes. Perfect.

The only downside was that the pillows were not very comfortable. I do not know if I could have requested different ones, but I did not ask, and eventually my head just adapted.

There were shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel provided, but I brought and used my own, so I cannot comment on their quality.

⸻

Room Service

Most mornings, I ordered breakfast to my room so I could have a lie-in. As long as I placed the order before 2:00 a.m., it was fine.

I even wrote in requests for items not on the menu, such as sourdough bread, smashed avocado, oat milk, and very strong coffee. They delivered it all without issue. The delivery gentleman always greeted me with, “Good morning, your strong coffee is here.” That little touch always made me smile.

⸻

Food on Board

I was not sure if I would use the specialty restaurants, so I decided to see how I felt onboard. In the end, I mostly stuck to the Main Dining Rooms (MDRs) and occasionally the Oceanview Café buffet.

I am a foodie, and I have to say the MDR food was excellent, high quality, and consistently well-prepared. I tried the chef’s specials on most nights and never had a bad meal. The French onion soup was especially delicious.

⸻

Entertainment

Most shows in the theatre were good, with one or two that were not my style. That was not because they were poorly done, but simply because they were not for me.

For shows and activities at The Club or Eden, I learned you need to arrive at least 30 minutes early if you want a seat with a good view.

⸻

Excursions

I did not book excursions through Celebrity because they were either sold out or overpriced. Instead, I booked directly with local tour operators. This worked out really well, with better pricing and great experiences. I often saw other passengers from the ship on the same tours.

Speaking with folks who did Celebrity-organized excursions, some were underwhelmed. I personally enjoyed all the independent tours I chose.

⸻

Premium Access

I paid for Premium Access, mainly for internet on multiple devices. It turned out to be a great decision because it also included:
	•	Complimentary room service
	•	Reserved seating at popular theatre shows

That last perk was especially handy on nights when the theatre was packed.

⸻

Highlight

The absolute highlight was seeing the Northern Lights. Truly magical. I added pictures.

⸻

Overall Verdict

This was a fantastic cruise, and I would highly recommend Celebrity Apex. It is not a party boat, but there are still plenty of fun activities. I even surprised myself by enjoying the ABBA singalong.

The solo meet-up itself was pretty quiet, but I never felt alone. Lots of people noticed I was traveling solo and invited me to join them for activities, meals, or just to chat.

The crew and staff deserve huge thanks. They worked tirelessly, always with a smile, something kind to say, and a willingness to help.

And finally, thank you to this community for answering my pre-cruise questions and giving me helpful tips. I am looking forward to my next sailing someday.

I am happy to answer any questions if you are planning something similar.

1n9w5zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n9w5zb/gf_broke_up_with_me_4_weeks_ago_and_will_move_out/,GF broke up with me 4 weeks ago and will move out next week,"Long post but I need to get this out of my system. The text is probably also all over the place, like my brains have been.

Me (32M) and my now-ex GF (29) were together for three years. We met on Tinder while I was traveling near her home town and we hit it right off. Aligning values. Similar humor. Similar interests and hobbies. Similar music taste. Same wishes for a relationship and the future. Good communication. Talking had never felt that easy with anyone else. Soon we started dating as long-distance first, but luckily thanks to my remote work possibilities and her school back then we were able to spend most of our time together in either city. You know that feeling when someone feels right in every way possible? That was what it felt like. It was safe.

  
One and a half years ago after she graduated we moved in together to the city I live in as I had work here and as a bigger city, it also provided her more opportunities. She didn't like the idea of staying at her home town either because it was a very small place and she had lived there almost her whole life. She started to look for a job here and we started to build our life together. Everything with her was always very smooth and after moving in together we both enjoyed our life together. We barely ever argued about anything and if we did, we were able to talk it through and communicate well. We talked about how we both wanted to get married at some point and buy a nice house close to the nature.

  
At the end of last year I had a period at work which made me very exhausted which also resulted in me being tired in my free time as well. Her unemployment had gone on for the whole year and at times she felt lonely as she didn't really know anyone else here. Despite my exhaustion from work I tried my best to give her the support she needs and do things together on our free time. We traveled often to her home town to see her family and friends. We had some shared hobbies but also did our own things sometimes. I felt like our relationship was on a solid foundation and we were functioning well. We talked once about how she feels I'm being distant, and we both acknowledged it was because of my work. We talked it through and everything seemed fine.

  
At our own little new years celebration at the beginning of this year we talked about our relationship. She told me out of the blue that she ""had had the urge to run from our relationship a few times already, but hadn't because she felt like I really loved her and she loved me"". I was baffled and honestly very frightened by that comment. I had no clue she had felt that way. We talked about it and she explained it was her coping mechanism in her teens and early 20's but thanks to her therapy she could deal with difficulties better these days. I tried my best to believe that but I guess that left me feeling she is sort of keeping our relationship on a gunpoint if things would become too difficult. I also feel like this was the time I somehow distanced myself emotionally from the relationship a little. Not because I wanted to but maybe I was afraid the relationship could just suddenly end. After all, I had had no clue she had felt that way and she hadn't told me.

  
For the whole spring this year we weren't as close emotionally as we used to and we both seemed to notice it. During the summer we had more free time together so I felt we were getting closer to each other again. We went to some festivals, we traveled a little and we did some nice stuff at home as well. She also finally got employed in the beginning of July, so we were both very happy about that. I felt like we were finally at the stage where we can start planning to buy a home together.

At this new job she got a couple of new friends which I was also very happy about. Roughly four weeks ago she went to have a coffee with one of these coworkers (30M). She said she'll be away for an hour or two. Almost five hours later I called her if she's coming home and she was just walking back home.  When she arrived home she told me she went for the coffee to figure out if she had a crush on this coworker or not. It felt like my world was shattering right there in an instant. I figured that might happen in long relationships and tried to tell her maybe we should think how to improve our relationship. She then told me she wanted to end things with me and wanted to keep hanging with the coworker as friends. She just instantly seemed to check out emotionally and mentally and I felt like I don't know this person at all. The conversation heated up into an argument.

  
For the next couple of weeks I spent my time and energy at home trying to talk things through, trying to identify where our distance came from and trying to come up with ways we could work on these things together. The only responses I have received have been:  
""I don't want this anymore"".

""I don't feel the same for you anymore"".

""You got too angry during the argument so I don't feel the same way anymore"".

""I want to be alone and single and find myself. To see that I can manage alone"".

""You have been too distant for too long"".

One day couple of weeks ago she texted me she found an apartment and is moving away halfway through September. No discussing any plans, no talking face-to-face, just a cold text. After the argument she was very cold and distant for a couple of weeks but after that she has come out of her shell a little and we have managed to talk a little. Still her responses aren't much different from the above though.

After breaking up with me she saw the coworker for a coffee a couple of times but agreed to not do that until we move apart, because I have been very uncomfortable about it. She now insists they are only platonic friends, and that's all she wants from him. She says she doesn't want to date him or anyone else either. She explained it was a ""friend crush"", that she was very excited to find a new friend who she clicked with. They seem to be chatting daily though and if I have asked about it she always instantly gets defensive and dismissive about it. ""Not your business"". ""Doesn't concern you"". ""It's private"". She's absolutely right, I know, but she's a person who has always shared everything with me in detail. The sudden change in her has been throwing me off the most. 

We have been able to talk enough that we have identified what caused the feeling of distance between us. It's a combination of a few small factors. I see all of these things as fixable and that this is more of an opportunity to improve our relationship. She only wants to leave.

She's going to move away in a week. I have to rot in our apartment for a little over two weeks more by myself until I can move to my new apartment at the end of the month. All I have currently going on in my life is work. It feels like the whole life I, and we, had planned has suddenly been erased and I have just a void in front of me. And inside me. Regardless of what she says I am afraid I'm being replaced all of a sudden.
