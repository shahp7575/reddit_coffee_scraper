1pzm5gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1pzm5gz/econ_we_must_continue_defense_through_development/,[ECON] We Must Continue: Defense Through Development Part 2,"Costa Rican Government after a research trip in the United States got impressed by a section of their tour when they reached the Tennessee Valley area. Home to the Tennessee Valley Authority a governmental body which specialises in electrical supply towards the state on the valley itself plus it's impact on the regional development of the area impressed the Public Works Ministry research group even more.

Once they reached back to the capital San Jose they continue with the their draft of the Second Defense Through Development Plan. The first plan ended with the finishing of one half of the Central Spine Railway with the other half under construction, and the continuation of the Costa Rican section of the Pan American Highway, with the added beginning of the expansion to the Port of Limon plus some infrastructural improvements in terms of roads, electrical lines and telegraph/telephone lines across the country.

This Second Plan is planned to be more larger and ambitious for the republic itself. First part of the plan calls for a creation of a new International Airport on the outskirts of the capital replacing La Sabana International Airport with a bigger airport to accommodate the size of new aircraft and maybe accommodate this new aircraft buzzing around Europe called the Jet Airliner if it one day reaches this side of the Atlantic. Other than that this airport will have a modern day storage and freight facility for transporting Costa Rican exports like Bananas, Coffee and Flowers to international markets more quicker plus it will host the home of Costa Rica first Air Mail Centre. This new airport will be located 24 kilometres west of San Jose in area called San Antonio it will have 4 runways with the main terminal located in the middle of it. Other features include a special train link between San Jose Central Station with the new airport

Second part of the plan is the double tracking of railroads under the United Fruit Company area in Costa Rica. As people in the region may know the United Fruit Company is one of the largest employers in the republic and the efficiency to transport produce from the plantations to the port is at upmost importance for both sides. Double tracking the current railroads can lead to more trains to be on the rails itself increasing capacity of freight transport trains. Other than that, in the northern plantations they are near towns which could benefit from this with an added bonus of a small passenger rail service. From one rail project we move to the next which is a intercity commuter rail within San Jose in a box area. This box area is west from San Antonia to the east in Cartago moving on to the North its Alajuela and Heredia to the the south at Desamperados. Inspired by the Tojo Line in Japan it seeks to connect San Jose with its neighbouring towns moving people around other than buses and automobiles. This service will be called the Interurbano Network it will have 4 lines with one special line connecting directly with the airport itself.

Third part of the plan is the creation of an agency akin to the Tennessee Valley Authority. This government body will be called the National Hydroelectric and Development Authority which it's core mission is to provide electricity, expand rural electrification, control and mitigate floods, and finally agricultural and industrial development. The location which was deemed perfect for this is the Reventazon River area near Turrialba. This river is perfect for hydroelectrical potential plus a good reason for flood mitigation as flooding occurs here a lot on the rainy seasons. a number of villages and towns are located next to it make it prime duty for giving them cheap and accessible electricity. The Costa Rican Government would work with the United States Corps of Engineers and representatives from the TVA in this matter trying to find the perfect area for a dam and how to mitigate floods in this zone.",1,1767111276.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

5’4, F, HW: 300, day of surgery I was 280 lbs. 

Today I am 190. I’ve gotten close to 185 but have been stuck in this range for literally almost a year atp.

To be frank, I have not been exercising. I am still conscious daily of trying to eat protein and less carbs during my meals. But I snack a lot and while I still can’t eat large portions, I usually sit with a plate of food in front of me for a couple hours and eat it slowly. So it feels like I’m eating the way I used to before surgery just slower. I also started drinking lattes from coffee shops again which is a ton of calories and sugar that I could eliminate from my day if I stop. But the worst part is I have a major sweet and salty tooth so Ive gotten back in the habit of having junk food daily. I honestly regret ever allowing any of that food back into my life. I wish I just continued with all the restriction I was practicing post surgery.

I have PCOS and I really struggle with fatigue, cravings, and mood swings and sleep disturbances. I thought that losing 100lbs would solve all that but it hasn’t. I’m working on it…I know getting to the gym is going to be a big contributor and also trying to gradually incorporate inositol + other vitamins to support more regularity. I’ve considered talking to my doctor about the GLP medicines if I qualify because I need to lose more weight and I really feel like I have an eating disorder or ADHD like I’m addicted to sugar and constantly feel the need to be eating.

I didn’t told her saan kakain para surprise lol. I arranged everything para sana seamless and wala na iintindihin sa gabing iyon.

Otw, she’s very excited and even guessing kung ano kakainan namin. I was so excited na magugustuhan niya to. Upon arriving sa area, napakahirap pala ng parking. Aaminin ko na hindi ko napaghandaan ito, kaya humingi agad ako pasensya sa kanya while finding a good spot to park.

After 10mins kakaikot, I concede and bumalik kami sa same spot. Male-late na kasi kami sa 7PM reservation and it was already 7:05. Even though alanganin ang spot, I made sure na hindi mag-aalangan ang mga kumakanang sasakyan.

Pagkababa ng sasakyan hanggang restaurant, nainis siya sa akin. Says sana sinunod ko na lang siya, ayaw pa naman niya nale-late sa reservation. I totally understood her and apologize. I felt very guilty about it. Ang nakapagdagdag pa sa mabigat kong feeling, naiinis lang siya 70% of the time sa restaurant.

I understand what she feels about it. Pero I just want to vent out my frustration here. Sana pinalagpas na lang niya iyon, kasi may mga bagay na hindi ko naman talaga ma-control. Hindi ito yung ineexpect ko na dinner. Ayoko rin i-open up sa kanya kanina habang kumakain, kasi I know babalik lang sa akin ang sisi, at baka lalo masira ang kain namin. Medyo impatient kasi siya lalo pag gutom, at kahit ako natatarayan niya paminsan

At least nakabawi naman kami sa coffee sa labas, and we went home satisfied naman. Pero hay, ayoko na maulit yung ganito, ang hassle.",1,1767111126.0,OffMyChestPH,1,0.67,False

Context:
     My wife and I have 2 children under 2, our little girl is 20 months and our son is 10 weeks. Needless to say, we don't get a lot of time for intimacy. It's not a huge problem as neither of us have overly aggressive sex drives, but we both have really strong needs for physical touch.

What had happened was:
     Last night we had some time to just sit in the bed and just enjoy each other's touch, mostly PG but some spicy stuff too. This morning I woke up and when I went to make the coffee, I saw the state of the kitchen and thought I should clean it up so my wife wouldn't have to walk in to a messy kitchen. About halfway through I thought to myself ""is this because of last night?"" I definitely didn't think to myself, ""because of last night I will do this for my wife"", but I wonder if it had something to do with my mindset this morning.

Discussion question:
Husbands - do you also notice that you just decide to do stuff you maybe wouldn't normally volunteer to do after having some sexy time? Unconsciously motivated I guess.

Wives - do you notice your husband doing more without you having to ask after you've had sexy time? If so, do you worry that he will become dependent on the ""reward"" to do anything for you?

1pzlvht,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pzlvht/built_a_finance_app_that_ignores_your_daily/,Built a finance app that ignores your daily spending (on purpose),"Hey Builders!

I've been frustrated with personal finance apps for years. They're either so detailed you drown in data, or they lack the flexibility you need when real life happens. So I built **Pfynn**, a new kind of finance app for those looking for a calmer alternative.

**What is Pfynn?**

Pfynn believes day-to-day financial calm comes from answering two questions simultaneously:

1. How much money will I have left at the end of *this month*?
2. How much money will I have left at the end of *next month*?

Everything else (transaction details, spending categories, budgets, etc.) is noise.

To give you that clarity, Pfynn does three things:

* **Centers you on two numbers:** After each weekly review, you see *This Month's Leftover* and *Next Month's Projection*. Those numbers account for your income, your known obligations (rent, car, utilities, subscriptions, loans), credit card payments due now (and then), and what cash is rolling over into next month.
* **Skips transaction tracking entirely:** During onboarding, you list your 15–25 main monthly obligations, the recurring expenses that actually shape your financial life. Pfynn connects to your accounts via Plaid and updates your two numbers automatically. No need to categorize every coffee or one-off purchase.
* **Built for households natively:** Partners can share a complete financial view, so you're making decisions together, not guessing. Of course solo households can use Pfynn just as easily!

**Why am I posting?**

I'm looking for real-world feedback from anyone willing to give Pfynn a shot:

* Is onboarding clear or confusing?
* Any bugs when connecting accounts?
* Are there painful or unclear parts of the UI/UX?
* Does focusing on just two numbers actually help you feel calmer about your finances?

**Who's it for?**

Anyone who wants to feel ""in control, not overwhelmed."" If you want a finance app you can actually stick with, giving you peace of mind in just a few minutes a week, Pfynn is for you.

1pzlv3t,https://i.redd.it/dg1yilty6dag1.jpeg,"New Day, new Direction …","A good day starts quietly.

I slept well. No alarms, no half-waking checks of fuel reserves, no subconscious fear of a mistake waiting to happen. Just rest. Then the small rituals that keep a long expedition human: preparing for the day, having a coffee, and studying the galactic map as if it were a newspaper.

That is how I found it—another nebula, roughly in my direction:

**NGC 6820.**

A quick change of plan. Next stop. And it is “just” **17 jumps**.

Out here, words change meaning. *Just.* *Nearby.* *In my direction.* In the Bubble those words are measured in minutes, in short commutes and predictable distances. Out here they become elastic. A seventeen-jump detour is an impulse decision, not a commitment.

Thinking about changing meanings brings me back to the coffee.

Yes, I still call what I am drinking “coffee.” I know it is not. I tasted the real thing in the Sol system a while ago—proper beans, real aroma, something that belongs to a planet that still produces luxuries without thinking. The difference is almost insulting.

And I did not stock up.

Next time I will reduce the repair limpets by one and use the tonnage for the original stuff. It is a reminder I should have learned earlier: expedition preparation is not only about the ship’s condition. It is about provisions. Out here, comfort becomes logistics. You do not notice it on short runs. You notice it when the weeks begin stacking up.

First jump in the new direction, and the galaxy rewarded the decision immediately.

A white giant star. A system with variety—multiple planet types, a layout that looks like it was designed rather than formed. Two moons flagged with dense life. Not a “stop for ten minutes” signal, but a “you will be here a while” one.

I took the time. Manual supercruise, no overcharge, no rushing.

Dust particles glowed as they hit my shields. Planets and moons slid past slowly, a choreography of gravity and time. I cruised toward planet 5—six moons—and the last one showed the richest set of bio signals. In the background: the stars, the galaxy’s band, and a fuzzy dark blot against it. The nebula I am now chasing.

It is surprisingly easy to do what I am here for—easy, not because the work is trivial, but because I finally know how to do it without fighting myself.

A lot has changed since my first explorations.

Yes, the equipment is better. Where I once needed six probes to map a planet, my factory-tuned scanner can do it with two. That is convenient, even elegant.

But the bigger change is experience.

The scanner only gives you direction. Skill is what turns direction into results: knowing what environmental details a species prefers; recognizing where habitats overlap so you can chain samples efficiently; understanding how light angle—sun position relative to your flight path—can turn a species from invisible to obvious.

And then there are the species that choose the high mountains.

Dangerous to fly there. Hard to find. Often impossible to land close enough to avoid a long approach on foot. I like a good hike. I really do. But you—**fungoida**—you know exactly what you are doing.

Which brings me, inevitably, to Vista Genomics.

Have those people ever been out here? Honestly. How do they decide the rewards they hand out?

On one side: **Stratum Tectonicas**. Uncommon, yes—but not hard to locate once you know what supports it, and once found, it can be sampled almost casually. And for a first discovery the payout can buy you a factory-new **Python Mk II**, with enough left over to pretend you are responsible.

On the other side: certain species—again, yes, *you*, fungoida—are a logistical punishment. A pain in the back, the boots, the time budget, the patience. And the reward often feels like an afterthought.

Then the larger question returns, like it always does when the credit counter climbs too easily:

Where does Vista’s money come from?

This kind of funding usually belongs to militaries, or to extremely large companies with motives that are not always clean. And perhaps that is the answer. Perhaps the data I hand over is worth more than they admit—not because of beauty, but because of leverage.

I consciously avoid looking at flashing lights or flashy TV shows.  On the 4th of July, I never watch the Fireworks.  I do my best to get a lot of sleep.  I also try to keep my stress level down.

My one downfall is I love Caffeine. At breakfast I drink diet soda, diet green tea, iced coffee and propel. I began drinking the drinks to fill up and keep my weight down.  My family said to be careful not to wash all the Medications out of my system.

1pzltfg,https://i.redd.it/x9s2sjp06dag1.png,"My 2025 Year in Review – 27yo in a VHCOL city, with an end of year twist!","Holy itemized, batman! Take a look at my 2024 Sankey [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1htrqmr/a_2024_sankey_recap_26yo_in_a_vhcol_city_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), to compare the spending 

**The Big Changes:** 

* With two weeks until the new year….I got laid off at the company I’ve been with for almost 4 years. I have many complicated feelings about this, but have no choice but to turn it into a positive in 2026. Here, that means my total income is slightly inflated since I was paid my severance package (which will take me a bit into January) in one lump sum. 
* This year, I managed to **reduce my average discretionary spending by about $100 a month.** I’m down in nearly all of my categories, with the exception of Clothing (+96), Collecting (+229, mostly used and antique books), and Gifts & Donations (+71).  I’m proud of having done this, but trying to stick to that budget definitely resulted in more financial anxiety than I’ve experienced in the past. 
* This year, I got a promotion to a very senior level position, **but only got a 3% raise**. I also did not get my yearly 3% inflation bump, presumably because of the promotion. I was disappointed in this.
* At 26 I joined the great American past time of paying health insurance. This was mostly covered by my small pay bump, but I had to take out 1% of my 401K contributions in order to keep my overall paycheck from taking a hit. I was disappointed there, because my 401K feels woefully underfunded for my age. 

**KEY TAKEAWAYS:** 

*The good(ish):*

* **I made a conscious effort to increase my emergency fund from 3 months expenses to 6 months**. I was just shy of it before I got laid off, but I’m glad I have what I have. It’s going to give me a bit of time in 2026 to figure things out. Phew!

*The bad:*

* This year, **my cats had two emergencies which cost a total of $4145.** I took 3K from my emergency fund, and the rest from my paycheck. This also prompted me to finally get insurance for them both. I love my boys.                    
* I’ve never been laid off before, so I didn’t know that you forfeit all of your pre-tax contributions upon termination. That means I lost about $150 in transit (about 3 month’s worth 😓) and $120 in FSA funds. Ugh. 

**BY CATEGORY:** 

* Last year, I broke out the categories of **Home Supplies** (think cleaning supplies, toilet paper, etc) and **Home Furnishings** into their own separate buckets. I’d really like to be able to move the “Home Supplies” category into Needs, instead of wants. 
* **Big Purchases:** This is a personal financial quirk– I put $150 to the side each month for anything that might be over $75+ in a single purchase. Sometimes this can be a big hobby purchase (Like developing my super 8 film– always expensive), sometimes it’s covering the additional spend that happens when a friend comes to visit, sometimes it pays for course I want to take etc. It’s deliberately kept vague to help psychologically with spending so much in a single go, and importantly– the first thing that gets cut when I need to save cash. A budgeted version of “don’t tell anyone– it’s a treat!” This category used to be bigger, but **I was able to reduce it by $1100.**
* I hate “**Misc**” being so high up in my discretionary spend! I’m sure it’s at least 85% ride share. Next year, I’m going to turn that into its own category.
* I don't know why the formatting is weird, but **Little Drinks** (coffees, teas, boba etc) is sitting at **$278.**",4,1767110511.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,0.83,False

1pzlqd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1pzlqd1/im_losing_my_pronouns/,I'm losing MY pronouns.,"It started in the middle of my birthday party. 

Seconds ago, two buzzing bulbs cast their light over me.

And then, only one remained. 

I wore two beaded bracelets on my wrist, which became one.

My 24th birthday cake had one candle. 

When my parents and friends' collapsed into a mantra of “happy birthday to *us*,” did I realize something was very wrong. 

Little things became caverns of impossibility I couldn't and didn't want to understand. My mothers eyes became one single blinking thing staring me down. My family was standing on one single leg. 

They waved, with one arm. 

Smiled, through one crooked tooth. 

I ran. 

Stumbling down the one step on our staircase. 

Now, a year later, I sit in an abandoned coffee shop at a single booth. There's one door. 

One window, reflecting the loneliest street in the world. 

One building, which is this one. Everything else is gone; everything else has been compressed into *one*. 

One car outside. Which is mine. 

That thought is comforting. 

The car is mine. 

Not *ours*. 

There is one coffee cup in front of me. I pick it up, draining it. 

I'm not expecting to live long. Not when I have one lung. 

One kidney. 

A single bone that holds me together. 

Fuck if I know *how*. 

“Say it again.” I tell Harry sitting next to me. 

“I'm fine. Relax.” Harry says, and just his words fill me with relief. 

Harry’s use of “I” when everything else is “we” is liquid pleasure running through one vein. His lip pricks into a smile, and he reaches across the one table, tangling his fingers with mine. Mine. A shiver rips through me. My fingers.  My heart. 

My Harry. 

I hold his hand when the two of us leave the coffee shop. One continent. One country. One path. The thing about inevitability is knowing one way or another, the future is fixed. It was Harry’s idea. 

Hike across what was left of the country. Find a waterfall. Fall together. Before we lost ourselves.

*We…*

The realization is painful, stopping me mid-thought.

*When did I lose “I”?*

I stop walking.

“Danny?” Harry frowns. “What's wrong?” 

“Nothing,” we whisper. “We’re fine.” 

He points ahead. “We should get going before nightfall, right?” 

We choke on our next words. They are painful.

“Yeah,” we say, pulling out our gun and stabbing it into our temple. How long until we pull the trigger, we don't know. 

Maybe never. *We* has always been a pronoun, right? Why was I so scared of we? Did WE mean I was singular, or am I still safe? Ahead of us, the clouds are pulled into one. Day and night entangle. 

Through a single breath, we find our voice.

We smile at Harry, and wait, seconds, minutes, hours, until he too can no longer call himself “I.”

I miss “I.”

I miss “mine.”

“Danny?” Harry nudges us and we lift our heads. “Are we going?” 

We smile. Against our better judgement.

“Yeah.” ",5,1767110323.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

## 📍 Destination 1: Mysore

## **Solo Trip – Day-wise Experience**

---

## **Day 1 – Arrival, Zoo & Palace Mayhem**

What I expected to be a relaxed and memorable first day turned into a **lesson in crowd management (or the lack of it)**. Mysore was *packed* beyond imagination.

* Started my bus journey at **7:00 AM**, reached Mysore at **1:00 PM** (expected 11:30 AM, but traffic had other plans).
* The delay threw my lunch plan off, but carrying **protein bars and shakes** helped me squeeze in a quick brunch instead of a full meal.

### **Brunch Stop**

📍 *Hotel Café Mysore*

* 1 plain dosa, 1 plate idli, filter coffee
* 💰 **₹180**
  Simple, quick, and effective.

### **Mysore Zoo**

* 🎟️ Entry: **₹120**
* Took nearly **30 minutes just to enter**, thanks to long queues and people pushing everywhere.
* The zoo has a great collection—birds, primates, big cats, herbivores, reptiles—but the **noise and crowd drove most animals into hiding**.
* Managed to see a few enclosures, skipped many that were completely jammed.
* **One-time visit only. Definitely avoid on holidays.**

### **Mysore Palace**

* 🎟️ Entry: **₹120**
* Absolute chaos.

  * 45–60 mins just to buy tickets
  * Another queue for entry
  * Inside: shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, zero crowd control
* I’ve visited palaces in Rajasthan—this was **worse than most temples** I’ve ever seen.
* Once inside, there was **no turning back**.
* Took **~90 minutes** to get through the palace, being pushed the entire time.
* The palace is stunning, but honestly, I was only thinking about **getting out safely**.

By the time I exited, it was **5:30 PM**. There was a flower show that evening, but since I had only one night, I attempted **Brindavan Gardens**.

### **Brindavan Gardens (Failed Attempt)**

* Huge mistake.
* After **3 hours**, we hadn’t even reached the gardens.
* Total traffic gridlock with buses and cars.
* Around **9:00 PM**, I gave up and asked the driver to turn back so I could at least eat properly.

### **Dinner**

📍 *Gufha Restaurant*

* Masala papad, mutton gravy, 2 parathas
* 💰 **₹950**
* Expensive for one person, but **worth every rupee**.
* Incredible food and a unique cave-style ambience—felt like dining inside an ancient cavern.

Ended Day 1 with a short walk around town and finally clicked a **night photo of Mysore Palace**, since daytime photography was impossible.

**Observation:** Mysore shuts down surprisingly early—post **11 PM**, the city is almost silent.

---

## **Day 2 – BR Hills & Into the Wild**

Started at **8:30 AM** after breakfast and headed towards **BR Hills**.

### **Shree Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy Temple**

* ~2 hours drive from Mysore.
* Peaceful, scenic, and spiritually calming.

🔗 For those interested:
[https://www.explorebees.com/India/Karnataka/Mysore/Sri+Biligiri+Ranganathaswamy+Temple/673](https://www.explorebees.com/India/Karnataka/Mysore/Sri+Biligiri+Ranganathaswamy+Temple/673)

I’m **not including temple expenses**, as offerings and donations vary based on personal belief. Like most major temples, there are multiple basket options and donation points.

### **Coffee Break (En route to KGudi)**

* Small open café with a *Coffee Day* board.
* Elevated wooden seating giving forest vibes.
* Coffee for me + tea for the driver
* 💰 **₹100**

### **Stay: KGudi Wilderness Camp (Day 2 & 3)**

* One of only **two government resorts inside a tiger reserve** in India
  (the other being **Dhikala, Jim Corbett**).
* Realistically, like most safaris, chances of spotting a tiger are slim—I didn’t see one.
* Wildlife spotted: monkeys, deer, wild boars (very comfortable around humans).
* Still, staying **inside a reserve** surrounded by forest was the highlight.

---

## **Day 4 – Temples, Food & Final Sightseeing**

Checked out at **10:30 AM**, cab pickup at **10:45 AM**.

### **Maa Chamundeshwari Temple**

* Reached around **1:00 PM**
* 🚗 Parking: **₹40**
* Vendors selling offering baskets right from the start of the steps.
* Ticket options:

  * ₹50 – regular
  * ₹200 – “special” (not really special)
* Even with the ₹200 ticket, the wait was **~40 minutes**, after which both queues merged.
* Multiple donation points inside—coconut breaking, thaali offerings, pandit counters.
* As a first-time visitor, I wasn’t prepared with enough change and felt a bit overwhelmed.
* Still, darshan felt peaceful and fulfilling.

---

## **Tasting Mysore Before Leaving**

Before continuing sightseeing, I decided to **experience what Mysore is famous for**.

### **Mysore Pak**

📍 *Sri Krishna Sweets / Word of Mysore Pak*

* Bought **500 gms of Mysore Pak**
* 💰 **₹540**

### **Mylari Dosa**

📍 *Hotel Vinayaka*

* 3 Mylari dosas – **₹180**
* Soft, buttery, and lived up to the hype.

### **Coffee & Snack**

* Mysore special filter coffee + sandwich at a nearby spot
* 💰 **₹115**

This felt like a perfect food trail to end the trip.

---

## **St. Philomena’s Cathedral**

* One of the most important churches in Mysore.
* Features a **grotto**, a devotional cave-like structure built as a **replica of the original grotto in France**, where you can light candles and pray.
* 🚗 Parking: **₹50**
* Donations are optional and entirely personal.

### **Jagmohan Art Gallery**

* 🎟️ Entry: **₹75**
* Displays:

  * Paintings of Mysore rulers (from the 14th century onwards)
  * Royal ornaments, furniture, clothing, weapons, and musical instruments
* Quiet, informative, and worth the visit.

### **Shopping**

* Skipped silk sarees.
* Ended up buying:

  * A **traditional pain-relief oil**
  * A locally made perfume
* 💰 **₹1,330**

### **Dinner (On the Way Back)**

* Highway restaurant stop
* Surprisingly decent food
* 💰 **₹360**

---

## 💰 **Expense Summary (Excluding Temple Donations & Safari Stay)**

### **Day 1**

* Brunch – ₹180
* Mysore Zoo – ₹120
* Mysore Palace – ₹120
* Dinner (Gufha) – ₹950

### **Day 2**

Wondering if people have experiences to share.","My husband and I (30m 29f, no kids) live in a condo building where we are cordial with some of the neighbours but never ended up getting too close just due to life. The building is mostly elderly people to the point where people were surprised when we moved in.  

One of my neighbours is an older man who lives alone, no kids or partner, and most of his family lives hours away. We're friendly with him, he's had us over for coffee once and we've had him over once, we chat in the halls and he keeps a spare key at our place. He seems to have a thriving social life but I'm worried about him after an experience last night. 

He has cancer and chemo has weakened him, so he fell down the steps and hit his head when coming in from getting groceries last night. He knocked on our door and asked to use our washroom because he couldn't find his keys, but he was bleeding a fair amount so we had him come in and sit down so we could patch up his wound and he seemed so shaken by the incident that we ended up having him stay with us for the rest of the night and overnight in our guest room. Which was lucky because we ended up having to call an ambulance for him due to a medical emergency in the middle of the night. We didn't follow him to the hospital but texted him to offer to bring him any items he needed. I was planning on going to the hospital today to visit but he texted that he's getting out later this morning and I again told him to let me know the time so I can pick him up. 

  
I guess I'm just not sure what to do after this; we don't normally talk that often but I'm worried about him alone in his apartment and want to check in on him more often. I just don't know how to do it without it being weird or awkward. I've never taken care of an older person before (my parents are in good health and my grandfather passed away during COVID so I couldnt really see him at all during the preceding months). This would be easier if it was somebody I knew better but given that he's alone other than friends I feel a strong responsibility to do what I can.

Like many of you I dread company Christmas parties, cocktail parties, coffee hour at church, ""mixers""... basically events designed for unstructured social interaction. For various reasons sometimes I've had to host them (which I find easier than attending as a guest since I have a job to do).

I've been to events where there have been attempts to create space for neurodivergence by having various games out. I love this idea, but it often has problems in practice when I've attended:

* Once a game is going, it's hard to join in. You end up hanging around awkwardly while other people play. It's the middle school lunch table all over again.
* Games often have a limited number of players. That creates a whole level of social negotiation about who gets to play.
* You can't dip out of many games easily without disrupting play for others. Especially as a parent of autistic kids, I never know when I'm going to be needed.
* Competitiveness can create weird dynamics in certain games.

So I'm looking for games that:

* Are fun! And not just for a few minutes
* Are easy to pick up quickly
* Accommodate a pretty widely varying number of people
* Have short rounds or some other attribute where it's easy to move in and out of them
* Are more chance-based or cooperative, avoiding competitive dynamics
* Don't require a lot of setup, and ideally can be played by guests at events and parties where the organizer didn't plan for it.

At least, that seems to be the ideal set of attributes. Other suggestions welcome.

My nirvana is that the autistic community has ""the game"" (not [The Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game))) which becomes the norm to have going in social gatherings. Walk into a room full of strangers? If it's large enough, maybe there's already people playing ""the game"".

Ages:

Brother: 30M

His girlfriend: 25F

Me: 29M

My wife: 30F (pregnant, 34 weeks)

Background:

My brother suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 2012. While he’s very functional, I strongly believe he still has some cognitive and emotional challenges from it. He’s a good guy, very non-confrontational, keeps to himself, and has struggled to get fully on his feet. He’s currently still in college.

His girlfriend has been coming over to our house more and more. She has a ton of energy, is extremely loud, talks nonstop, and says she’s diagnosed with ADHD. My pregnant wife has sensory issues and gets overwhelmed by her very quickly.

Over time, I’ve started noticing patterns that really concern me.

Power / Control Imbalance

She has a master’s degree and works in the medical field, making around $120k/year. She lives with her parents, so she has a lot of disposable income. My brother does not make much money, and money has never impressed him but she talks about it constantly.

She frequently tells him:

	•	He needs to make more money

	•	He should apply for certain jobs

	•	He should sell his car so she can buy a new one and he can drive hers

Early in the relationship, she spent $500+ on skincare products for him and regularly pays for his food. Now it feels like she uses money as leverage. None of it feels supportive it feels controlling.

Isolation

My brother doesn’t have a huge social circle, but family time matters. Since they started dating, I’ve noticed she often pulls him away from family events or schedules things so he misses out on time with us. It feels intentional.

Commitment Issues / Emotional Games

My brother wants a committed relationship. About a month in, he was fully committed but she was still on dating apps and even went on a date with another guy.

She has:

	•	Told him when other men flirt with her (e.g., someone at the gym calling her cute)

	•	Refused to call herself his girlfriend even after 3+ months

It feels like she keeps him insecure on purpose.

Christmas Incident (Major Red Flag)

This is where things really escalated.

My parents came to visit for Christmas, we don’t see them often. Household was:

	•	Me (29M)

	•	Wife (30F, 34 weeks pregnant)

	•	Brother (30M)

	•	Parents

She said she’d come to our Christmas Eve white elephant exchange, so we waited until 6 PM for her.

When she arrived:

	•	Introduced herself as “the PA”

	•	Would not stop talking about her job, how hard it is, how much she makes

	•	Completely killed the vibe

Even my brother later admitted she “ruined Christmas Eve.” My wife became so overwhelmed she went upstairs and stayed there.

Christmas Day: The Coffee Disappearance

At 8 AM she offered to get coffee. The coffee shop is 3 minutes away. She mentioned her phone was dead and left around 8:30 AM.

She was gone for 5 hours.

We:

	•	Called and texted nonstop

	•	Checked the coffee shop (she wasn’t there)

	•	My mom was crying, genuinely worried

Eventually, I got a call from the police department. Somehow, she had ended up at a casino, then at a random person’s house, where she called the police.

Her explanation:

	•	Got coffee

	•	Got lost

	•	Went to a thrift store

	•	Drove around

	•	Went to a random house to call police

She returned hysterical, asking, “Did you think I died? Were you all worried about me?”

She had planned to leave for her parents’ house at 3 PM, but because she was gone until 3 PM, she “had to” stay and spend Christmas with us.

Later:

	•	She cried about her job

	•	Talked about “saving everyone”

	•	Went on political rants

Eventually, I told her directly that I rarely see my parents and asked her to leave. She cried. I didn’t feel bad.

Final Incident

The night after my parents left, she knocked on my bedroom door.

She said:

“I have a gift for you, or do you want to answer my question first?”

Her question: whether she could work for my company.

I said no (due to her medical history and behavior).

She pushed back aggressively, got in my face, and started ranting about politics and the system being broken. My wife finally got up and told her she was out of line and needed to leave the room.

Why I’m Here

I genuinely believe this woman is manipulative, emotionally unstable, and possibly exploiting my brother’s vulnerability. He either doesn’t see it or minimizes it.

I don’t know:

	•	If I should confront him directly

	•	What to say without pushing him closer to her

	•	How to protect my family while still supporting my brother

Am I overreacting, or are these serious red flags? How do I approach this without making things worse?

She had me late, but no one would ever know it, she was so energetic and present with me. Truly, she was my best friend. We shared wardrobes, shoes, secrets, interests, and our love of coffee. I called her 17,000 times a day just to talk, and I slept over as much as possible because we had our shows to watch and crafts to do. Having her as my mom was an honor, and I still struggle with her passing. 

While my mom and I share so many features, both physical and emotional, I can’t see her face in mine at all, and it breaks my heart. 

Of course, I look vaguely like her, but not enough to find any comfort in it. My mom didn’t look even remotely like either of her parents, so I find it even more ironic that I care about this at all.
I want to call her and say, “Woman, where is your face in my face, can’t you share?” because she would find this fixation super amusing. 

I like my face very much because she loved me and would tell me my face brightened her mornings every single day.

I found out this recently he has mislead me about his friendship with his ex (33F). He told me they were purely platonic friends and he had strict boundaries with her. They are no longer friends because after everything below I told him I couldn’t be with someone who had a friendship like that and he cut her off — but I’m still struggling to move past this. 

\- they were friends for a few years in early 20’s dated on and off for 4, and then having a seriously relationship for 2 years. 

\- She dumped him \~4 years ago for “not trying” and for not fighting for her when she said she was thinking about ending it. He let it happen and said he felt relieved. 

\- They stayed friends 

\- I asked him a few times to set boundaries with her due to some alarming things I saw; BF was argumentative and defensive and swore their friendship was appropriate. 

\- I snuck and read their most recent texts… I found her sending a bunch of messages he didn’t reply to, including photos of them as a couple, calling him, and saying “I hate you” when he didn’t respond. 

I was obviously very upset. My BF sent her a stern text saying these photos made him uncomfortable but saying he valued her friendship, and she quit texting him for a month… but then my bf called her, and she picked up the 2-3X / week texts. My boyfriend would show me the texts. 

Here’s the kicker: none of her texts mention me, although they do mention her boyfriend excessively (whom she got very serious with right after my bf put a label on our relationship). 

These made me very uncomfortable and I told him I couldn’t be in a relationship with someone who has this sort of friendship. He broke off his friendship with her. He was sad at first, but now seems fine. 

I read all their historic texts from their time as “friends”. Their friendship is of the nature that she texts him multiple times a week with intimate details about her life and messages (I love you; I miss you, etc.,). My BF did not reciprocate the sentiments, sometimes shuts them down “jokingly” or by not responding. 

Her messages, while “friends” include a lot of photos of herself… including some risqué PG13 ones. My bf did not respond. 

I also found out he lied to me about getting coffee with her BEFORE he ended their friendship but while he was dating me. I did notice she asked him multiple times to hang out (he kept saying no) until he said yes.  During the same time, I found out she invited him over to her house to share wine and put her head in his lap. I also found out she has a history of problematic behavior, including getting upset with my BF when he would date other girls (although he told me she didn’t get upset when she found out about me). 

I am trying to move past it, but it is very difficult. He has obviously cut her off, but it stings to me that he looked me in the face and told me they had a normal friendship when she was putting her head in his lap, texting “I love you” and he lied to me about getting coffee with her. Nothing about this is normal to me. 

I am confident nothing physical has happened between them — from the way she texts, I feel like I would’ve read it in the texts. 

Hoping to hear some perspective that could help me understand my boyfriend’s behavior, because it doesn’t seem like he has feelings for her, but how could he risk losing me by allowing her to behave like that? In every other way, he is an amazing partner and he is always excited to progress our relationship. ",0,1767109584.0,AIO,5,0.5,False
1pzlea7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1pzlea7/confused_can_you_offer_any_advice/,Confused! Can you offer any advice?,"Background - bit of a hot cold, on off situationship type thing with this guy historically (been out for semi ""dates"" / coffee type meet ups, but never actually got it together).

Anyway now he's split from his girlfriend and we arranged to meet up for coffee again recently. Nervous vibes from both of us when we first meet, slightly awkward hug, we relax into easier conversation bit by bit as we walk around town for a while before finding somewhere to go into.

I buy us drinks. Then he sits and I sit .... and I get this split second moment, where we're directly facing eachother, and it feels like his face and body are suddenly an open to me like a book - kind of a mix of really excited, interested, affectionate and smiley - and everything in me was like ""oooh this is it, he does like me! Something's going to happen here!""

And then the next moment, it's like the shutters come back down, he kind of twists so he's facing a bit side on from me, legs crossed - and it's all reigned in, nothing showing emotion-wise.

He barely breaks eye contact as we chat, but it doesn't feel that ""sparky"" or flirty way, it's intense but controlled if that makes sense. We sit and chat for a couple hours maybe, and he seems to enjoy chatting and sharing stuff, but no real feeling of intimacy returns, after that initial moment.

Anyway after we finish our drinks I kind of expect him to make an excuse to leave - but I offer to show him my new place on the way since he's parked nearby, and he says yes right away.

On the walk over I comment he walks really fast - he's walking like he's on a mission, slightly ahead of me at times - and he laughs and says yeah he gets told that alot, and slows to match my pace more.

We get to mine and there's tension between us in the lift up to my apartment, both not knowing what to say and feeling it, and when we're inside I feel him giving the side eye alot, as I prepare drinks and chat. In other words when I look at him he's not really looking at me, but when I turn away or he thinks I can't really see, he's looking at me again.

He sits next to me on the same settee, but honestly it seems to me like he's squirmed into the corner as far away from me as he can be, his legs crossed so they are facing away from me - whereas I'm sitting in an open, relaxed posture facing him, one leg up on sofa, but being careful of boundaries and ensuring to give him his space.

He leans in a couple times, seeming comfortable getting closer at times when I show him something on my phone or laptop. I see his side glance at me as quick as lightning when I joke about walking around in my underwear at one point, and he makes a comeback on a similar theme. He follows me to the kitchen sometimes when I am talking.

He stays for a further couple hours, mentions future places he'd like to go with me, says to let him know what my plans are for new years eve. All in he spent around 4 hours with me, seemed a little reluctant to leave - but made absolutely no physical moves on me, and seemed physically reserved rather than flirty. Our goodbye hug was warmer, I felt like he held it a fraction longer and tighter than before - but nothing obvious and I might just be being hopeful there.

So yeah - what to conclude here? Is he just nervous or hiding feelings - or is that wishful thinking? I think I might know the answer, as I keep revisiting it in my head and coming out doubtful or at least confused.

Thanks for any insights, even if it's just to confirm my doubts / suspcions that he's just not into me.",2,1767109530.0,bodylanguage,8,1.0,False
1pzle64,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1pzle64/how_do_you_balance_being_very_helpful_and_nice_to/,How do you balance being very helpful and nice to a woman you are dating without being a simp?,"So I grew up as a nice guy. Just always been that way from birth. I like being nice, but it comes with problems to be honest. The biggest one is that people see it as weak behavior even if you have boundaries. In fact, people have told me to be a little bit colder when meeting people and only turn nice once they earn it. 

Some people think that you are either being nice for ulterior motives or you are just simping. I think it is hard for people to actually believe that you can just be genuinely nice. 

Like I once stayed on the phone with a woman for 12 hrs straight because she was having a mental breakdown. I used to drive my roommate to the store and to bars because he didnt have a car. And I used to give this girl in my class encouragement before every exam and give her rides home from the bars when we went out as a class. 

I have worked on this alot since being taken advantage too many times. So I have learn to say no which is very hard for me. I actually used to cry when I told people no and I would call people to say if they are ok with my boundaries lol. 

  
But getting to the question. How do you balance being nice to a woman you like? Im not really a simp because I dont do things hoping to get something. I just like seeing people smile. For example, a random girl in a coffee shop needed a charger and I gave her mines. She even got surprised and I told her to give it back to me when you leave. She was able to submit her resume because of that. That just made me smile. 

But I have seen women that I have dated take advantage of this as well. With my ex, I had to text her good morning everyday, pay for everything, and tell her she was pretty. We didnt make it but the thing is even when I stood up to her. She just told me that Im not a nice guy and broke up with me. 

So I didnt get respect and then I wonder did I just meet someone who only saw me as a tool. So im curious what is the happy medium here",0,1767109521.0,AskMenAdvice,51,0.31,False

In fact, when I am referring to him, I'll just call him ""Senior"" The following was recorded after I got him a little tipsy and begged him to talk more about the life.

. . .. Where did we cap off last time? Oh right, John The schmuck.

Yea they never found that poor bastard, Old Man Maroni was beside himself with grief. He always thought John had been taken out by a rival of his from across the river, course he could never prove it. That didn't stop him though, he was on a warpath, itching for blood.

Truth be told I think he was just glad for the excuse.

One day he pulls me aside and he says ""Frank, I need you to drive some friends of ours uptown, they need to make a payment up there.""

This would be the first hit I would ever be a part of, officially anyway- I don't count the carpet debacle as anything but. Was I nervous? Hell yeah.

Riding with me was Ricky Toro and Dex Finnegan. Ricky was made young, a somewhat controversial topic actually, and he had brought his childhood buddy to the top with him. Ricky was a top earner, some scheme or scam always rolling around in that thick skull of his. With that pale mutt Dex on his side, he could back up any swindle and come out on top. His big money maker was fixing fights, so it was a shock when I found out he had volunteered for the hit.

My guess is he was tired of the whispers, how he had never really stepped up for the family, yet they opened the books for him. I could see him in the rearview, on the surface he looked calm and collected. But the fidgety knee going a mile a minute told a different story. Dex though, pfft he seemed bored with it. I didn't know a lot about the guy-kept to himself only really hung around Ricky and his crew. He was a tall golem with a mop of fiery red on his head, I know that much.

The mood before we crossed the river was jovial, like soldiers given their first marching orders. It was weird, the second we hit Manhattan you could feel the mood wither and die. It was real all of a sudden. My old man had pulled me aside before we left. There was a hint of pride hidden behind that stoney face. He tucked something away in my coat, ignoring my protest. ""Just in case."" he kept saying. He was a careful man, Vincenzo. I'll always grant him that.

Finally, we pulled up to our target. It was quiet, though not unusually so. It was Sunday after all, and most of the neighborhood were a few blocks away paying their dues. The barbershop had tinted windows, but we could peer in and see the shadows of the unsuspecting mooks inside. We could make out at least six or seven human shaped blobs bobbing around in there, the biggest sitting down; getting attended to by a slim shadow with slicked back hair.

Now I don't know about Ricky and his bloodhound, but I pretty much shat a brick when I saw that oval shaped bastard sitting in there. Old man Maroni had scuffed the intel a little, inside wasn't just Carrisi's right hand, but Benito Carrisi himself.

I realize all these names are lost on you Franky, way before your time. I sound like a cranky old mule when I say, ""back in my day,"" but, well back in my day The Carrisi crew were the biggest scumbags across the river. They owned their little patch of land and fought tooth and nail to preserve it.  

Benito was a miserable fat bastard, his gut spilling out of his button down. His breath reeked of week-old tuna and when he smiled you could see the toll years of decay had taken on his snaggled and jagged teeth. He was a vindictive son of a bitch, and he wasn't supposed to be there that day, or so we were told. We sat in fearful silence for a moment, each man weighing their options. Finally, Ricky pulled out glock-90 and slapped Dex on the back.

""Let's teach these pricks a lesson they'll never forget. Franky: I don't care if God comes by you do not move this car till, we come back."" His accent was heavy and hardened, determined to prove himself to the family. Dex nodded his head at me, saying nothing as he headed out. 

I kept the engine running, my foot nervously tapping the gas. I reach to my jacket pocket, reassuring myself it wouldn't be needed. I watched as Dex and Ricky positioned themselves, an unspoken maneuver between the duo. Ricky leered in front of the window; pump action firmly planted in his hands. Ricky readied himself by the door out of sight.

The denizens inside completely unaware of the carnage about to unfold. There was a nod between them, and Ricky pushed open the glass door. Heads turned as the overheard bell rang out, and before they knew it the tinted windows exploded inward, raining down shrapnel and buckshot. Ricky stayed halfway by the door, spraying and praying as he blasted inside. I could see the look on his face as he could barely hold onto his Glock, wild eyed and cold at the same time.

The Carrisi crew went down, and they went down hard. I could see Benito crawling on the floor over to one of his fallen men. He was wearing a blood-stained track coat and blue overalls. Three of his men had gone down in the first volley, two more blindly returning fire from behind makeshift cover. Shards of glass-stained blood littered the inside as shell casings dropped to the ceramic floor of the shop. I kept my head down at first, not trying to catch a stray.

I heard Dex cry out and stagger back, catching one in the shoulder. Ricky saw this and swore out, hitting the attacker dead in the head. I saw it all from the Vega, the first time I had ever saw a man die. His head snapped back on impact, blood spattering against the wall. He collapsed in a heap onto the ground like a pile of dirty laundry. It was instant, like someone had just flipped his switch and he was gone- *Senior snaps his fingers*\- Like that.

Dex retreated to the Vega wincing as he studied his wound. Wasn't bad, but I could tell it hurt like hell. Ricky ran back to the car, providing covering fire. Which was really just him shooting up the storefront. He hit everything but the final man and Benito, who was getting up and staring us down from the inside. I could see that snaggle toothed puss snarling at us like a rabid animal.

 He grabbed a pair of scissors from the ground and hurled it at Ricky. It soared through the air, I swear to Christ Franky, and it hit Ricky right in the chest. He cried out and dropped his gun, clenching himself.

Benito charged out the door with a roar, grabbing him by the collar and slamming him onto the hood of the Vega, the whole care shook and groaned as Benito began pummeling him with his fists. I sprang into action, getting out the revolver my old man had tucked away from me.

 I felt like Dirty Harry waving that thing around. The final shooter inside took aim at me, and by sheer luck he missed. I took aim at the kid and fired away, the gun nearly jumping out of my hand; the recoil punishing me instantly.

I must have hit him, because he cried out in agony, and disappeared from view. Now it was just me and the ogre beating Ricky to death. I jumped out the car, adrenaline pumping through my veins like steroids, and aimed down on the hulking mass. Benito was so focused, tearing away at Poor Ricky's face.

 Ricky's face had already ballooned up into fracturing lumps of bruises and welts, like he was a pile of red clay Benito was working tirelessly to reform and disfigure.

""You dumb fucks come here, I'll have your whole family strung up and skinned for this!"" Benito raved at the top of his lungs. ""I'll send you back to Maroni in pieces, I'll march down to Jersey and raze the whole fucking state down!"" I don't know if he was talking to me, Ricky, or God; but he was too far gone in his lunacy to notice me. 

So, I unloaded on him, five shots right into his side. Smoke poured out of every hole and for a moment he seemed to tank every shot. He stopped in his assault, breathing ragged and choked. He slumped down onto the ground, fists clenched to his side. He took one look at me as he dragged himself across the pavement, eyes burning with hatred.

My eyes flicked to Ricky, barely conscious on the human shaped dent on the hood. He was wheezing and coughing up some crimson fluid, so I slumped him over my shoulder and threw him in next to Dex, still struggling with his shoulder, blood still flowing no matter how much pressure he applied. 

I scrambled to the driver's seat, sirens starting to wail in the air towards this massacre. I peeled out, burning rubber as I left Benito to bleed out on the sidewalk, hoping to cross the river before the streets flooded with cops. 

*-Senior takes a long pause and a swig from his drink. I was too stunned to speak at first. I stuttered at first, struggling to find the words-*

*(I thought you were just a driver)*

I was. At first. Overtime that role grew, and before I knew it, I was running my own little crew. It all changed that day, that first hit. I managed to give the cops the slip and head back into friendly waters. Got Ricky some help as soon as I could, dumped the poor prick in front of an urgent care and reported back to Old Man Maroni with Dex.

He was pretty pleased with himself, Benito's favorite hangout in shambles and five of his men dead. Total embarrassment and he just had to sit there and take it-

*(back up, I thought he was dead?)*

Benito? Nah all that blubber, it was like perfect insulation to take five slugs in the side. His boys whisked him off before the cops came, got him patched up. Dex came out of it with a pain in his arm every time he moved it, but Ricky? He had to have major reconstructive surgery. He came out with a scarred-up face and an eye welded shut. And he wore that mug like a badge of honor. No one said shit behind his back anymore, and he nicknamed himself ""Prince Charming"" some kind of ironic joke, I'm sure.

For my part in it I was praised for keeping a cool head and getting them back safe. I returned the revolver to my father without a word, and he never mentioned how it was empty. He simply patted me on the back and said to 'keep up the good work."" I didn't respond. It was finally hitting me what had gone down that day. How there were five confirmed dead-at least one of those souls following me to this day. 

I would later find out my old man ""knew"" what would happen. It was why he gave me the piece. The night before he had gone to his longtime *comare*, a learned woman from the old country. Her name was Anastasia, and she claimed to know things before they transpired. Call it tarot, call it black magic, call it whatever you wanted. The truth of the matter was this Raven curled beauty had my father coiled around her finger, she would whisper prophecy in his ears and bed and my father would bark orders on her whim. 

*(You believe stuff like that?) - I laughed but Senior got a dead serios look on his face-*

Let me tell you Franky I saw some strange shit over the years. My old man was a believer for sure, but Paulie was REALLY superstitious. One time I'm driving him on a collection run; we stop in front of the grocery store. Nice sunny day, heat bearing down on us like nobody's business. Paulie was wearing a wife beater, I only bring that up because he looked ridiculous in it, just absolutely drenched in sweat.

Supposed to be the last stop of the day, he barely gets out and takes a long look at the roof-then he climbs back in, tells me to drive on. I ask him what the fuck, because this place was already short two weeks in a row. Paulie points up to the roof, and perched on it was a black crow. Largest bird I had ever seen, just basking in the heat. It was looking down at us, the Vega must have looked like a giant ruby to it. I go

""So what, a frigging bird."" Which earns me one of Paulie's patented smacks across the head.

""Don't be fresh. Them things are harbingers. We'll come another day."" he said firmly. Well, I knew better than not to argue so on we went. Not five minutes later we see to patrol cars barreling down past us. Turns out the joint was being robbed.

He never left his brownstone on the 13^(th) of any month; he carried salt in his back pocket to throw past him if he walked by a graveyard. He skeeved black cats and birds, went to Church every Sunday, 8am on the dot. I don't know if he was simply OCD or what. I tell you this much, he never balked at an order he knew came from the mouth of the prophet.

There was this one time, I was hanging with my buddy Carlo down at Cindy's. Cindy's was a bit of a dive, but it was our dive. Sid, the pony-haired blonde who tended the bar was eyeing me from across the bar, a saucy look to her emerald eyes. Carlo was egging me on, until Paulie emerged behind me from the back, a cockblocking ape who reeked of cigars. He clasped me on the back, robbing me of my breath and suave attitude. 

""Come on Romeo. We gotta take a ride."" I heard him speak low enough just for the two of us. Carlo snickered and took a swig, drawing the wrath of Paulie. ""You too Mercutio.""  

We drove with the windows down that night, the springtime Jersey air doing wonders for our lungs. Paulie explained on the way, one of Vinchenzo's ""accountants"" had up and vanished. Been about two weeks since he last kicked up, and the wall was starting to crack a little. His *comare* had told him ""Lawrence has been communing with someone he should not."" The old man took that to mean he was collaborating, though that didn't explain the disappearing act. It was pitch black when we arrived at the little slice of suburbia that Larry called home. Even in the evening the scent of freshly cut grass wafted in the air. In the distance a dog barked to the cheering applause of crickets. The lights were all on, an oddly unsettling sight this time of night. We jogged up the drive, eyes darting back and forth like we were bandits in the night.

Which hey I guess we were hahaha.

We went around back, porch light buzzing above us. Paulie had his piece drawn, and I was carrying as well. Carlo liked to carry around this butterfly knife he found in a Chinatown back lot. He claimed he could do all sorts of tricks with it, but I never saw him try it. But I digress.

For some reason, none of us thought it prudent just to knock on the door or even call out to Larry. I had this gut feeling we shouldn't be there, and I could tell by the strained look in Paulie's eyes he thought the same.

Finally, Carlo said, ""Fuck it."" and leapt towards the back door, pounding on it like a madman in heat. ""Larry boy open up, we're friends of the old man."" He called out to nothing and was met with such. The dead silence from inside was starting to get unnerving; Paulie was giving me the ""We should get the fuck outta here."" side-eye. 

Carlo knocked on the door once more, only for it to slowly swing open-a light breeze chilling the air in front of us. The door swung open, the naked back hall beckoning us. It was at this time I took my piece out as well; Paulie had put his hands in the air and started to walk back up the drive.

""You gonna tell the old man you walked away?"" I shouted at him. Paulie paused in his tracks. 

""Sunnova bitch."" he grumbled, shoulder checking me as he entered the dragon. He turned back and saw us gawking at him, a hint of the devil on Carlo's and I's face. ""Come on you cocksuckas lets go."" He bellowed, and we scurried behind him like rats leaving a sinking ship.

Larry's home was. . . I guess cozy was the way to put it. There was a lingering smell of rot wafting in from the kitchen, but other than that it was homely. The walls were adorned with old family photos, glimpses into past of our missing comrade. There was a decent sized cube of a tv sitting in the corner, through the frayed and grainy image I think I could make out replays of last week's Giants game. A leather-bound recliner sat upright in front of it. Next to it a dinner tray with a warm beer on it. I took a whiff and gagged, smelled like dried out skunk piss. 

""Ooh, come here a second."" I heard Carlo holler from the kitchen. I was met with both him and Paulie standing around a dining room table. It was filled with rotting food, flies buzzing around set plates with half eaten homemade cooking that devolved into colorful slop.  It stunk to high heaven, Paulie was stepping back with his shoulder to his face to keep from dry heaving. Carlo was leaning over it all, hand rubbing his chin like he was goddamn Sherlock Holmes. Finally, he came next to me to share his observations. ""I think whoever was here left in a hurry."" He mused out loud.

I swear to you Paulie rose in the air and flew over just to smack him in the back of the head because I blinked and suddenly Carlo was going ""ouch"" and rubbing his scalp. 

""Fucking *stunad*."" Paulie grumbled, a hint of dry vomit on his breath.

 ""Three plates out, he must had company. He had no wife or kids.""  I countered. Paulie begrudged me that one.

""Wife died giving birth a few years back, kid only lasted a couple hours after that. Breach. Tragic shit."" He pondered aloud. There was a hint of empathy in his voice, but only enough to give the illusion of caring. There was a cup of sour milk at the head of the table, looked like aged tapioca. Carlo leaned over and sniffed it, again thinking he was some great detective. Ignoring him I turned to Paulie, who was deep in pondering.

""This has gotta be retaliation for sumthing right?"" I whispered harshly to him, my mind flashing back to the carpet fiasco. Paulie shook his head.

""Larry wasn't heavy with anyone, well liked, kept to himself. Even if it was a message, we would have received it by now,"" He remarked under his breath. Carlo came up behind me, probably about to say something that would make Paulie throttle him when we heard it.

*thump.*

The three of us looked up at the ceiling in unison, like it was some macabre stooges' bit. I thought it was a one off at first, the wind had knocked over a vase or something. That was when we heard the pitter-patter of feet scuttling around up there, sounded like a wild animal was crawling around.

Paulie held his gun like a security blanket as he gave the ceiling a death glare. Carlo was cautiously making his way to the stairs. The only sound was the fuzz of the ancient tv playing as we tiptoed through the living room. I peeked up the stairs, a soft thumping noise echoing down them. It was like it was taunting us, daring us to come and see. Carlo looked past me, a cocky look on his face. He had brought his knife out; he looked like a greaser displaced in time. He brushed past me, planting himself on the first step.

""Larry is that you up there?"" He called up, his voice booming in the small case. Paulie pushed him, steam powering out of every orifice on his head.

""Are your parents fifth generation inbreds? Ya ever hear of the element of surprise?"" Paulie growled.

""Oh, like they didn't hear us stomping in here,"" Carlo complained, brushing Paulie's hands off him. ""Your fat ass couldn't sneak up on a deaf nun."" I got in between them before they tore into each other, putting a finger to my lips and giving them both the death glare. They put aside their idiocy for a moment, coming together to find whatever was stalking the second floor. We crept up weapons drawn, our senses sharp as daggers.

There was a rank smell up there, different then the rot. This was a-a musk of some kind. Strong and willful, the rancid stench of a sulfur miner coming off a twenty-hour shift. We put up our noises at it and studied the upstairs. Two halls, a crossroad in the middle leading further. To the right a bathroom, nothing special. To the left an old bedroom, set up like some kind of nursery. My heart ached seeing that, Larry boy never got over it.

Down the middle the stench grew stronger, drawing us in. Naturally we followed the smell, unsure of what we would find at the end. Two doors on either side, window smack dab in the middle. Both doors were closed, but we could hear movement, loud and scattered. It was impossible to tell what room held our mystery. Paulie flicked me in the chest with the butt of his gun. 

""I'll go right, you and shark bait over there take left."" He commanded in a hushed voice. Carlo was about to pipe up, but I jabbed him with my shoulder, following Paulie's lead. I put my ear to the door on the left, and I swear I heard hushed whispers. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but the voice sounded like it was gargling rocks and spite. I gave Carlo the nod and we burst through the door, and I aimed my piece at-

Nothing.

The room was empty. We were met with an unkempt queen size bed and a hardwood floor filled with dirty laundry. A couple pictures hung on the wall Esque, like the room had been met with a localized Earthquake. We went in on high alert, still not sure if we were alone. Carlo went over the closet and tore it open, jabbing his knife in and out like a nutjob. After he was done stabbing Larry's nice suits he gave me a shrug. That was when I noticed Paulie was being awfully quiet.

I looked over to see him clutching the doorway with one hand, repeatedly making the sign of the cross with the other. His face was crunched up and contorted in horror, like he had seen the gates of hell open up personally. He was muttering something under his breath, but I couldn't make it out. My guess it was some variation of the ""Hail Mary"" with his own personal flavor added in.

I approached slowly, touching his shoulder. As soon as my hand touched him, he twirled around and shoved his gun in my face. I didn't even blink at first, but I think I did piss myself a tad. He lowered it almost instantly, a look of fear glazing over him, his breath shaky and pained. 

""Franky-"" He choked out, ""-we need to get the fuck out of here, right now."" He sounded horrified. He pointed to the room and then booked it down the hall, not even waiting for us. Carlo joined me at the threshold, and we peered in. It was Larry's study, his desk overturned and crammed against the lime green walls. Papers littered the walls and floor, scribbled with some unknown language or simply Larry's sloppy handwriting. Engraved-carved in fact- in the middle of the floor was a circle adorned with strange symbols. In the middle of the circle was a nine-pointed star-and a barrier of salt surrounding the whole thing. Melted candles were glued to the points, the remnants of some god forsaken ritual Larry had done.

The air inside that room felt wrong, a chilling breeze greeted us from nowhere, the hairs on the back of my neck flashing warning signs. I couldn't help but notice the salt-line on the carving was broken, salt bursting outward and glistening on the floor. I almost socked Carlor in the jaw, he startled me so badly whispering right in my ear.

""Jesus, Mary and Joseph,"" He muttered next to me. ""Kinda sick shit was this guy into.""  Before I could reply we heard a thunderous crash from downstairs followed by Paulie screeching ""MUTHA OF FUCKING CHRIST!"" and the blast of his pistol. We raced downstairs, calling out for Paulie. We were halfway when we saw Paulie standing in the middle of the living room, panting and waving his gun wildly. A shattered chair lay next to him. He saw us standing there like idiots, his eyes wide and crazed. He pointed his gun at the kitchen as he yelled his explanation.

""They threw a fucking chair at me; it laughed and said my name and everything."" He rambled. We approached him with open arms, but come on huh? I was gonna try and calm him down when a plate whizzed past my head and shattered into pieces. The rotted slop it had held fell to the shag carpet. I faced the kitchen, seeing nothing there but a now half empty table. There was a gurgling sound, a sort of dark clucking, like whatever had done it was mocking us. Well Paulie had enough of that and raced out the backdoor with us nipping at his heel.

He covered us as we ran out the back, though I don't know what he would have done. We caught our breath in the drive, hearts racing a mile a minute. Paulie was keeping busy; he rummaged around back and eventually came out with a half empty gas canister and a dirty rag. He forced it in our hands, ordered us to stuff it and light it. He searched his pockets and came out with a metal lighter. I dumped a little gas on the house as Carlo doused and lit the rag.

Before long flames were quickly devouring the back porch and we were retreating back to the car. Paulie was already there, watching the place quickly become engulfed in flames. The heat was intense; we could feel it all the way from the end of the street. The house made a groaning sound like a wounded deer. Least I hope it was the house.

From the street we could see the upstairs window, and I swear to you junior I saw a figure standing there, highlighted by the raging fire. A dark shadow with eyes like dancing embers. I knew it wasn't my mind playing tricks because I could feel the thing reaching out to me, trying to tell me something. What it wanted, I couldn't tell you. It just felt like evil clawing at my mind. None of us said a word on the drive back. Paulie didn't leave his house for two weeks after that, when I finally did coax him out, he looked so shaken and dopey eyed, like he hadn't slept since that night.

Eventually he reverted back to his old jovial self, but he refused to comment on that night. Carlo and I just stuffed it all to the back of our minds, making jokes about that haunted house we saw one time. The implications of it all never really hit us, I didn't want it to. The fire ended up reducing the house to cinders, taking any evidence of Larry and his whereabouts with it.

My father was furious when he heard what happened, ""How do you screw up a simple welfare check huh?!? If I send you idiots to pick up a pie, ya gonna shoot poor old Luigi and rob him!?!"" He screamed at us from his office. Me and Carlo just stood there, embarrassed to even explain what we had seen. Anastasia stood by my father's side, her mystic emeralds studying us. She wore this flowing crimson dress, I think they were going to some party after my father was done chewing us out. 

She leaned down as he was catching a breath, whispering something secret only for him. My father had a strange look then, like he had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He faced away from us, a deep sigh rumbling from him as Anastasia curled around his shoulders.

""You boys had a rough night, nothing we could do for Larry in the end, I suppose you did what ya thought was best. Get outta here, give Paulie my regards."" and that was the end of that. I never did find out what Ana had said to him, but I suppose that's none of my business.

*-Senior takes a long pause, not even drinking. I cough to regain his attention, and he eyes me, sorrow creeping on his face. -*

I remember the first time I met Ana. Vinchenzo and ma had an unspoken agreement; he would never bring business home-and she would turn a blind eye to flaunting his girlfriend. He would take her to lavish parties, He would bury her in jewelry and romance, while doing the bare minimum for ma, the sweetest woman in the world.

I began to resent all of them frankly, him for doing it and her for letting it happen. It had been a few weeks of collection pickups; I had just gotten the Vega actually. The old man thought it was gawdy but fuck em, he wasn't slugging around town for his cronies. One night he tells me I'm going to drive him to dinner. My heart drops, it's Saturday night, HER night.

In front of ma, he tells me this, like he's enjoying twisting the knife. I swallow my pride and go ""Sure pop, whatever you say."" He has me dressed in a nice suit, he's in this old-time black and white two piece, it's like he stepped right out of a photo with Capone haha.

He sits in the back and tells me the address. He's silent pretty much the whole time, save for one moment when he tells me to ""Slow down, this ain't the Kentucky derby."" I pocket that comment to bitch about later and pull up in front of Anastasia's place.

It's an apartment building, old by the looks of it. There's a goofy looking ad by the door for ""Madame Ana"" with a picture of a gypsy caressing a crystal ball. Corny shit, and since the old man was ancient even then, I expected some dolled-up call-girl with a hiked-up dress and a faux turban to stroll out of that building.

Imagine the donkey-faced look I had when out strolled Helen of Troy. She couldn't have been much older than me, late 20s, early 30s. She wore a long, flowing blouse that left little to imagine. My father flicked the back of my neck, gesturing to open the door for her. I scrambled to open the passenger door for her, and her hand touched mine as Aphrodite slide next to the prune.

She flashed me a smile, her eyes locked onto mine as she did. I thought nothing of it at the time. I tried to focus the road as I drove them to Bella's; this gourmet place the old man was in the middle of busting out, as they cozied-up in the back seat. It was revolting to even think about, much less sit three inches away from. Finally, we made it to the joint, if you've seen one Italian joint you've seen them all, and I got out to open the door for them. Vinchenzo patted me on the back as he passed, barely looking me in the eye as he whispered, ""Drive round the block for an hour or so,"" Ana raised her eyebrows, pouting as she replied,

""I had hoped the young gentleman could accompany us tonight."" Her accent was thick, like she had just stepped right off the boat. Vinchenzo looked at me, grinding his teeth and already regretting dragging me along. 

""Sounds like a nice time."" The inside was crawling with the who's who of Jersey scumbags that night. We were tucked away in a private booth, but every few minutes it seemed some half-drunk goombah was coming back to pay their respects. There was Paulie of course, he never missed an opportunity to grovel. There was Old Man Maroni, held up by two cronies forcing a smile as their boss babbled like a drunken idiot. Prince Charming was there, pre-face lift of course. There was Nicky Valant, few guys from New York; Benny Barino, Louie Stacks, even the Irish from across the bay were coming over to kiss his ass, and my father fucking hated the micks.

He would make a big show of showing Ana off like she was a cut of prized veal or something. Made my stomach churn, and from the look in her emeralds she felt the same. Eventually things settled down and we put in our orders. Ana leaned in eager to learn all about me. How was I liking my new gig, what'd I study, what was ""Vinny"" like growing up? I swore I saw him blush at that question. I tried to be polite and answer honestly:

""It can be a drag but good money- English Lit till I dropped out- And Vinny has always been the same *miserabe* he's always been right pop?"" I flashed him a grin at that and was meet with all the sense of humor dead fish could muster. Ana laughed though, a giggling bray that could crack any wall. 

""Vinny has told me so much about you, he's glad you've finally shown an interest in the business."" Dad shot her a look but said nothing. 

""I wouldn't go that far, just been driving some friends around really."" I sheepishly replied, little red showing up on my face. Ana scoffed playfully, waving her hand in a mock fashion.

""*Mio Dio*, handsome and modest, such a winning combination."" I blushed and cleared my throat, trying to change the subject.

""So, tell me ""Madame Ana."" you really got a crystal ball."" I cracked

.""Hey, watch ya remarks Franky boy."" ""Vinny"" warned, though that was met with a horse laugh by Ana.

""So quick to anger my beloved, you should watch that temper, lest it watch you."" She warned.  Her eyes flicked to me ""You Americans love your assumptions about my trade, so I play into them-just a tad."" Pfft, now who was being modest.

""Us Americans? You hearing this pop?"" I feigned outrage. Vinny shook his head, like he'd heard that line a 100 times before

""*Madone* don't get her started, she'll go on for hours."" He lamented. I saw a fire blaze in Ana's eyes; she clucked her tongue and snapped her head back.

""You boys- you play the *soldatino* when you've never felt the boot of Rome on your neck."" She scoffed. Vinny took a swig of his white wine and chuckled darkly.

""I didn't mean to offend."" I offered ""Just never met a-uh, eh fuck it mystic before."" I tell you junior you could have cooked an egg on my forehead I was so red hahaha. 

""My mother taught me much-but she envied the sight I was blessed with."" There was a hint of sorrow in her voice. ""I had to leave quite suddenly. It was-luck I suppose I met your father so soon."" She placed a hand on his thigh and flashed a smile.

Our food soon arrived, carried by a plucky waiter with an obvious combover. He laid down a plate of shrimp scampi for my father- a stake for me and chicken parm with noodles for the lady. It smelled divine, cooked to perfection. I heard Ana say ""*Grazie.*"" to the waiter as he walked away as Vinny licked his lips.

Ana dug in immediately, stacking her fork in a mound of pasta, twirling a big chunk and gulping it down in one bite. A touch of sauce dribbled down her chin as she moaning, savoring every single morsel. Vinny was about to take a bite as well when Ana suddenly pointed at him, wagging her finger like he was a schoolboy. 

*""No, è avvelenato.""* she said, muffled as she chewed her food. Vinny scrunched his face, not understanding a word of what she had just said.

""Don't talk with ya mouth full-"" He began.

""Do not eat that-it's *veleno*. Poison."" She said that last part slowly, sounding each syllable out like she had just learned the word I chewed the fat piece of meat I had rolling around in my mouth as my father turned as white and cotton as his bedsheets. The old man was trying to compose himself, eyes darting around the smashed room as the snakes he called friends partied on. 

""Who-who would have the fucking gall, here of all fucking places."" He sputtered in a ushed voice.

 ""The short one-Nicky something with the toupee."" Ana replied so casually, eating like nothing was happening. I was stunned by this bold admission, but I sure as shit wasn't gonna take a bite of the scampi to find out for myself. ""He's upset you passed him over for the pretty boy.""

""Wh- Ricky? Kid's a top fucking earner-four times what Nicky brings in."" Vinny grumbled. Ana simply shrugged, continuing to enjoy her meal. 

""Eat then, what do I care-keel over and vomit out your ass in this nice place."" She said with venom. Vinny stewed and mulled his options. Finally, he quietly excused himself, waving over Paulie with a snap of his fingers. He whispered something in his ear, and I saw bloodlust overtake Paulie, as he snapped his focus to Nicky's table. He was lost in the sauce now, two girls on his arms as he told some foul joke. Two men I hadn't seen before appeared behind him, grabbing him and quickly escorting him to the back. A gaggle of wise guys followed suit, assuring the other patrons that nothing was wrong and to go about their business.

There was a mummer of discontent but ultimately no one cared as they dragged the protesting little guy away. I was alone with Ana now, twiddling away embarrassed at the sudden show of force and in awe of the sway she seemed to have over Vinny. 

""You saved his life."" I finally admitted breaking the tension. ""How'd you know?"" I squinted at her like an idiot heh. She dismissed me with a wave of her hand.

""Pfft, please huh? Lil Nicky will not be the one to topple the wall."" She squared her face at me. ""You have so much hatred for that man."" 

""That's my father you're talking about."" I said in a lower voice.

""He flaunts his adultery to your face, how could you not. A sick wife at home and he galivants with a younger woman. I am no saint Franklin, but he should know better."" she grimaced.

 ""Well, you aren't exactly blameless in that."" I spat, and I regrated that instantly- to this day I don't know why. 

""You think me a whore? I am-disappointed but not surprised. Your father is boastful, but he does not act."" She gave me a lingering look to think that one over. The look on my face must have looked like a toddler trying to figure out how two and two make five-because she let out a low giggle, clearly enjoying my befuddlement.

""So... If he aint-""

""He wants to. But he covets my sight more. I've been his paramour for-two years now. You've seen his rise."" She lingered on that last thought. I had always wondered what his edge was-and now she was smirking at me from across the table. 

""And I always thought he was some tactical genius."" I murmured to myself.

""Is it not-ah- Tac-tic-al- to use every advantage you have against the wolves at your door?"" She countered. I didn't answer.  She narrowed her eyes at me. ""You are-how they say- ""Not the fastest horse in the race"" yes?"" She laughed playfully. I cracked a smile at that.

""Good thing I'm handsome then huh?"" I rose my glass in a toast. Ana met it with her own glass, and the clink rang out. We chatted a little longer about her life in the old country until Vinny reappeared with the rough clearing of his throat. He was standing by Ana's side awkwardly-his knuckles course and bloody. His cuffs were caked in red, but he didn't seem to care. 

""We should get going here. They found a rat in the kitchen, need to clean it up a bit."" He lied. As we were leaving- Without paying mind you- I couldn't help but notice some of Pop's goons escorting patrons out. Must have been one hell of a rat in the back huh hehe.

Ride back to Ana's was quite- drove with the windows down and just let that cool breeze wash over me. When we got back Ana leaned into the driver's seat and wrapped her arms around me. She smelt like lavender. She told me it was wonderful meting me and hoped we could see each other again. I couldn't see Vinny's face when she did that, but I can imagine the seething it might have held.

He walked her back to the door, holding her by the waist. He leaned into her ear, whispering something. Ana blushed but pushed him back, shaking her head no. Dad gave her a peck on the cheek good night, and gave me one last glance before disappearing inside. Dad slammed the passenger side when he came back-clearly disgruntled.

He didn't have to say shit- I started the car back up and sped off. He huffed and puffed back there, finally catching me staring at him. he forced some good cheer on his face as he leaned back.

 ""Heh, she's something ain't she Franky? Would have told ya to get lost so we could uh-get some coffee but, well I guess she needs a break. I wear her out something fierce."" He proclaimed boldly. I held my tongue, and the old man seemed satisfied at that. ""She seemed to take a liking to you."" He spoke. Again, he was met with silence. "" Nah that's good, she's good people. Just uh-don't forget who she was friends with first.""

He didn't say anything for the rest of ride-didn't need to. Motherfucker.

*(I stopped the recording here. He was flustered and needed a break. Frankly I did as well, I had no idea how big of an impact the life really had on him. I also had no idea he believed in so much hocus pocus crap, I'll have to drill him for more on that. I did notice something though, when Senior was talking about that Ana woman. It was his eyes. They were filled with pain. I'll update as soon as I can-until then; I guess beware ghosts throwing chairs.*)",2,1767109272.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pzlaar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo_2_Resurrected/comments/1pzlaar/playing_offline_d2r_is_a_game_changer/,Playing Offline D2R is a Game Changer!,"I woke up extra early on this day-off and decided to write this fluff piece while sipping my morning coffee.

As a Switch player, I am genuinely enjoying the offline experience so much more than online/ladder. On Switch our max player count online is 4 and let's be honest there are a small handful of online Switch players due to the inability to crossover with other consoles. This means you're stuck playing with 1 player count and leaves you feeling alone because there's the underlying notion that you're 'online'.

I decided to create a Pally and followed a Holy Fire levelling guide. It was recommended that you switch to Hammerdin at around level 30-40 or by the time you hit nightmare Act 2. I was not prepared for how fun Holy Fire/Zeal can be even with player 8 count. Each zone in Normal was basically Hell Chaos Sanctuary on steroids with the experience gain.

After completing Normal the terror zones rolled Chaos Sanctuary and Tristram so I spent the next hour and half enjoying the extra experience boost and picked up some nice set items for Nightmare. By the time I finished Normal + 90 minutes in terror zones I was level 52 and managed to picked an Eth 4os dimensional blade and 4os scythe in those 90 minute of TZ.

It made sense to switch to Hammerdin now as I already had the required runes for spirit and merc insight, I created stealth, lore, ancients pledge as well and very easily cruised through Nightmare ending with 1x Kurast TZ rune where a 4os pally shield dropped which was instant-socketed for spirit. I finished Nightmare at level 72, feeling strong.

Before I begin my journey into Hell I have fully accepted that being Offline as a Switch player is most optimal and my love for the game I grew up playing has been renewed again. I have played in various locations over the past few days: on the train, at a coffee shop, at a pub, at the library, and at my desk with my 34"" monitor. I do not own a desktop, no TV either but I do have a projector that I move around my place which is fun.

This is not new information but some highlights about offline mode:

* Increase/decrease player count 1-8 instantly
* No lag, such smooth processing
* More excitement when items drop
* Maps gets saved unless you switch difficulties
* No one is going to help you

Last year, coffee pot broke, and I found a 10-dollar imusa at walmart. I really fell in love with it but have maybe loved it to death at this point (a year later)

My imusa has a red plastic coat that began peeling off. it's a real microplastic nightmare. Still peeling slowly, probably 50% there. 100% of my apartment covered in little red particles. 

After a year of near-daily use, the flavor has turned metallic, if that makes sense. There's nothing toxic in the metal right? I hope not. 

Look I am american, I like to use a dishwasher to wash my dishes, it saves me time and gets the job done. I put my stainless steel cookware in the dishwasher too, sue me. They still work perfect, never coated, non-peeling and love the fact they'll last until the heat death of the universe. So I'd love most of all if it was lifetime/long-lasting, easy-care and even dishwasher-safe.

I have a bright future in a career that I am passionate about. I have a caring family that will always have my back and support. Although of few friends, those that I have are very close and trustworthy. However, for most of my life, there is something that I have lacked. I am not just talking about love. Rather, I am talking about simply having someone.

 

Someone to walk through life with. Someone to carve through the intricacies of living with. Someone to support and be supported by. Someone to talk about my day with, and who tells me about theirs in turn. Someone with whom I can share my pains and joys, and who shares their victories and defeats with me as well.

 

I am neither looking for my soulmate or for the perfect woman. I do not want to rush blindly into something, either. I am looking for a friend, an eventual partner who will always be there for me, as I will be there for her. I am looking for someone to get to know all about, step by step, and see where life takes us. If any of this resonates with you, please keep reading.

 

**----- About me -----**

 

I am a 33 years-old guy from Chile. I am 185 centimeters tall, with an average physique. I am black-haired and brown-eyed. While I do not exercise often, I take proper care of my health. I do not drink or smoke. I speak both Spanish and English fluently, and I am learning Japanese. I am involved in the computer science field, something that I am pretty passionate about. Some of my hobbies are watching anime/series and playing video games.

 

As you can guess from those hobbies, I am mostly a homebody with nerdy interests. However, I enjoy doing several other things as well, especially if it is with the right person. Going out on walks, visiting new coffee shops, going to the cinema, and any other relaxing date plans are enjoyable to me. Traveling around the world and learning about many different cultures is also something that motivates me.

 

My personality type is INTJ-A. I am a naturally curious person, so expect me to inquire often about all kinds of things. I am also pretty structured and like to be the one who gets to manage all kinds of things around me.

 

**----- Who I am looking for -----**

 

What I will be describing next are the characteristics of a partner I would have high compatibility with, but I am not looking for someone who fits this description perfectly. What matters to me is that my eventual partner is aware of our differences and is willing to find a middle ground whenever we are in disagreement.

 

Communication is very important. I hope that we get to talk regularly and get to know each other to the best of our capabilities. I will do my best to keep the conversation ongoing and I hope you will do the same. To me, asking about how each other’s day is going is something to be appreciated. I do understand that work, studies, and other things will sometimes keep either of us busy.

 

I feel more comfortable getting to know someone who is a few years younger than me, but I will not provide a specific age range as what matters to me is chemistry and having similar goals. While I care more about these things and emotional attraction, I must mention that I do have a preference for girls with a healthy BMI. I am happy with any ethnicity or race. I do not have a problem with what your religion is, either. I am more than happy to learn about your culture.

 

I hope that you are passionate about your path in life and would love to hear you talk about it. As for hobbies, you do not need to share the same hobbies as me, but a willingness from both of us to learn about the other’s hobbies would be nice.

 

**----- Closing -----**

 

I want to be clear that I am looking for someone to become friends with first. Of course, as time goes on, I am hoping for this to evolve into a long-term relationship with the right person. All this will most likely start online but, if we decide to commit, I want it to become something in-person. We can and should talk about meeting up when the time comes.

I’m thinking of placing an order for some solstice scent samples, but post-holiday gifting, I’d like to be financially smart about it. 

There’s quite a few scents I’m interested in, but I feel some could be redundant if they fall in the same scent-category. I’d love to solicit reviews and find out your favorites. 

**Cold/Winter/Mint/Snow:**

*Snow Shoe Pass, White Fox, Snow Mint Mallow* 

Considering these three is what started the whole cart in the first place. I adore the opening of Alkemia’s *For Love of Winter.* It’s so cool and peppermint-y without being overly sweet, and trends more towards atmospheric than gourmand. Genuinely chilly. But after 20ish minutes, it’s just a generic white amber on me. I thought maybe these might fit the bill. Doesn’t necessarily have to be minty, just looking for that blast of chill to last past a half hour. 

**Dark/Woody/Resinous/Smokey:**

*Tenebrous Mist, The Mantel/Mantle, Midnight Eye, Russian Caravan*

I love smoke, tea, and tobacco, though my skin tends to eat smoke. I’m a little worried the bay rum in Tenebrous will read generic cologne, and I don’t always vibe with coffee (midnight eye). The mantel feels the safest to me but I’d love to hear your thoughts! 

**Flourmand/Floral/Mostly Rose-focused Flourmand**

*Rose Custard Kulfi, Rose Mallow Cream, Morning Room, Victorian Tea Room, Lace-Draped Spectre, Iced Wisteria*

Lot of Solstice classics in here. I tend to shy away from gourmands as I don’t love scents that are very very sweet. That said, I know Solstice is known for how they handle flourmands (fleurmand?), and I’ve come to learn I really love more “grandmother”-associated florals, like rose, iris, orris, etc. I’m worried about the sweetness of Rose Mallow Cream, and what style of vanilla is in LDS. Is it very bakery? More vanilla bean?

Lastly considering *Sweet Clover and Bonfire Smoke* because I’m always chasing the smell of the field of my grandparents house in the summer.

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially starts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

Nobody spoke. Neither did I.

By the looks on their faces, they were just as surprised by the news as I was.

I can buy the same coffee brand, same roast, same bag size yet some days it tastes:

overly bitter

weirdly sour

or straight up burnt


Other days it tastes perfectly fine.
Is this caused by:

Water temperature?

grind size?

brewing time?

or something else people don’t usually think about?


I feel like most people blame the coffee itself, but I’m starting to think we’re messing it up without realizing it 😅


Would love to hear from anyone who’s experimented with this or works with coffee.

I’m [ M20 ] and I’m looking to spend a day exploring some of the more ""soulful"" parts of the city. I'm flying solo right now and would love to have some company to share the experience (and help each other take some good photos!).

The Plan:
Morning/Afternoon: Start with a peaceful walk through Lodhi Garden. It’s one of my favorite spots to just sit and breathe.

Cafe Hop: Maybe grab a quick coffee at Perch (Khan Market) or check out the Lodhi Art District for some street art.

Evening: Head over to Gumbad Cafe near Jama Masjid. I’ve heard the rooftop view of the domes at sunset/night is unbeatable.

Food: Wrap up with some authentic food in Old Delhi or keep it light at the cafe.


About Me: I’m a pretty chill person, into [  hobby, e.g., architecture, deep conversations, or just people-watching]. I’m not looking for a party vibe—just a relaxed day of walking and good views.

If you’re free this [ Wednesday ] and this sounds like your kind of day, drop a comment or DM me!
Safety first: We’ll meet in a public spot (like a Metro station) and go from there!

this summer i had a depressive episode due to my  bad habits of sleeping and overstressing myself but it felt weird cause it started when i watched a horror film and this one was mostly cause by coffee. this feeling im having i hate it so much, i feel depressed and anxious and i dont know why. i dont know if theres something wrong with me or that im having something else but seriously dont know whats wrong with me. im taking an antidepressive but its in low dosage and there have been times i skipped it and even there was an entire month of me not taking it but i dont know what cause it.

  
i do have ocd and obsessive thinking but its weird how hard it feels to control it and it does feel easier when i have company. when im alone i do feel panicked for no reason and i recently when to the ER but they just gave me benadryl to sleep it off which calmed me but the next morning it felt the same with the extreme anxiety. So i wanna know, does anyone have something similar or do i check myself more ?",1,1767108661.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I see a lot of white people there. Never seen so many in my life because I grew up in Atlanta/ union city Georgia. It is uncomfortable at times because white people don’t seem to know boundaries. But I can’t say it is all of them. A lot of them do have manners and respect. But onto my day yesterday.

On Sunday’s and Mondays I usually work dessert and coffee station. That is where you’ll see the most of everyone. So while I was cleaning the coffee station, people still make their way to make their coffee, no big deal. But there was this white woman with glasses who was just standing behind me and she’s just standing. So I ask her do you need anything ma’m? She doesn’t even look me in the eye really she just awkwardly sort of shakes her head and weirdly smile but not smile. I always ask the people who are waiting for me to finish do they need anything and they’ll say it and I’ll let them through or give them what they want so I don’t cause a line. But this woman is still standing behind me. Everyone is still getting what they need from the station. So I turn around and ask again, do you need the honey because it was the only thing I was cleaning while everything else was available. She aggressively goes “I’m fine!” She said it with such a tone! I turned around and continued to finish and even purposely took my time. As I had my back turned a guest came up to her to ask her a question, I didn’t hear it, all I heard was the lady respond “I’m just waiting for her to finish”. 

The woman didn’t even look rude at first glance. I was just trying to help out because it’s a bit awkward how you’re just standing behind me as I am cleaning and fixing up my station, makes me feel kind of rushed. ",13,1767108623.0,blackladies,15,1.0,False

“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”

“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.

“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”

“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”

Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”

I blinked. “Is that a new major?”

Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.

The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.

Another delay was not what I needed right now.

The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.

It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.

That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.

“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially starts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”

“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.

“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”

She snorted, but I was dead serious.

She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.

I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.

When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.

“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”

My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”

Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”

I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.

“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”

The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.

“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”

Now that caught my attention.

“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”

“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”

“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”

I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.

“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.

Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”

Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.

I bit my cheek and took the key.

“Creative housing it is,” I said.

She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.

“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.

Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.

“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”

Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.

“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”

“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”

“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?

My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.

We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.

Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.

“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”

“Didn’t what?”

“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”

Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”

She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”

“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.

We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.

“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.

I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”

“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”

I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.

“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”

The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.

My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”

“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”

“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”

Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”

I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”

“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”

“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”

She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.

I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.

The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.

I followed them.

I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.

Three men looked up at me from three separate places.

One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.

Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.

And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.

Nobody spoke. Neither did I.

By the looks on their faces, they were just as surprised by the news as I was.

I’m a 60 yr old female who is 8 wks post surgery. Therapy went well right from beginning.. it felt incredible to be stretched, she said your arm can’t go any further. All range of motion was successful her doing it. 6wk sling removed slept in bed, finally! Now time for more aggressive therapy. Which I was excited for! (I had both knees replaced I absolutely worked hard with therapy for them) you get out what you put in!  I’m having a hard time with pulley over door, and bands. It’s very painful during at home therapy. I medicate an hour before and ice right after. Honestly I’m using more meds now than after surgery! I absolutely follow all the do’s and dont’s I follow surgeons and therapists rules. But this truly is painful raising arm upwards I’m at 100 degrees side outwards 100 behind my back well I can reach back pocket, that one is tough and tight, I’m afraid to push that. I’m using my operated arm more now, as the rules apply, coffee cup, eating. I am now washing supper plates and silverware, glasses. I do not want to re-injure! But this last week as badly as I wanted out of the sling I want to put it back on! The past 3 nights I went back to the recliner! My elbow hurts all the time.I’m hoping for some Insight from those of you who are 10-12 wks out as my 8 wks is hopefully still fresh in your minds. I see surgeon at 12 wks to which he would like to see full range of motion.

For large parts of my stay I was bedridden and there really weren’t many options to binge on additional food outside of tea and coffee. As someone who struggles with binge-restrict-cycles, I was first terrified that I would gain since I couldn’t eat my safe foods and be exposed to trigger foods at every meal. But as I kept roughly calculating all my meals, I realized that they matched my tdee and recognized that after a while I actually felt more mentally stable and my binge urges quieted. I still had them, especially after the last meal of the day, and still spent a lot of time obsessing over the daily menu and felt out of control, but overall I was doing better than I was at home stuck in my extreme cycles.

It really illustrated to me how lost in my disorder I am and how much I struggle to just.. eat meals. I initially wanted to keep this up after my stay or at least move closer to it, but unless the food is literally kept from me, I can’t regulate myself. In the hospital I only had the one sandwich, meanwhile at home I still have the whole loaf of bread left over when I finish my normal sandwich. So I again cut bread out, declare it a trigger food, heavily restrict my safe list, and again end up in my restricted prison. I have tried to gently introduce more food so many times, but I always fall into binge cycles. I still felt anxious in the hospital and the idea of losing autonomy terrified me, but a part of me wishes I lived in an institution where I had no control anymore",4,1767108143.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False
1pzktas,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzktas,RPG Dream Life Meadow,"For 2026, I went all out!

  
I created a whole game inside Notion including (but definitely NOT limited to) these unique features:

* Museum of Right Choices - revisit milestones, tiny wins and favorite moments, for a dash of nostalgia
* Archetypes - create different personas that make up the wonderful YOU. do quests based on your energy level, collect fragments the more you do ‘good’ quests and clear scenarios (therefore increasing your hero’s arc), accumulate ‘cracks’ the more you do ‘bad’ quests (therefore growing your shadow’s arc).
* Brain Bank - dump your random thoughts and ideas and organize them based on your energy level
* Portfolio - you can make your skills, projects and services public for your prospective clients to see.
* Energy status per quest - filter quests based on your energy
* Growing flowers when completing habits
* Turning projects, fears, insecurities, annoyances and other deterrents, into BOSS FIGHTS (I call them clearing scenarios though 'coz I'm a huge fan of ORV 💖💖💖)
* Buying me-time from my Mall - reduce feelings of guilt and shame when you take breaks 😅
* Shopping for fun items like gears, spells, affinity gifts to boost my stats for boss fights (i honestly created these only 'coz I've accumulated too much gems from doing quests this year hahaha)
* Having a date with my favorite character ‘coz who says delulu is NOT the solulu?? (Yeah I wanna have a date with Kim Dokja and hang out with Han Sooyoung)
* Customizable game dialogues in my dates and boss fights (inspiration and exciting challenges for more dopamine!)
* Levelling up the town by adding more ‘villagers’ and clearing more ‘scenarios’
* The 'scenario' will pick the winning item from my Mall choices and I can claim that for FREEEEEEE
* Boosting my favorite character’s Attack and Defense stats by doing quests with them and giving them gifts!
* Increasing affinity with them thru quests, gifts and clearing scenarios!

  
I made gamification my obsession, I mean my focus this year 😂😂😂

  
Combining productivity + play created wonders in my own life this 2025, making me achieve the following results:

* managing my rest much better with less guilt
* less overwhelm with doing tasks by turning them into quests where I gain XP + gems
* reducing, if not eliminating, my imposter syndrome thru visual progress of my skills and avatar level.
* being more consistent with my habits (not perfectly but I was able to do them more often and with more lightheartedness instead of the heavy weight of obligation.)
* managing my expenses better, knowing where my money goes to most of the time is a great eye-opener.
* fell more in love with being productive each day as the tasks become quests and exciting adventures i can do with my favorite characters
* pace myself more slowly and not panic at the first sight of unchecked quest log.
* encouraged me to give rein to my creative side much more freely.

  
there are honestly so many things I've managed to overturn in my way of thinking and dealing with every day stuff.

I’m testing a very simple AI workflow with one constraint:  
**in \~10 minutes, turn a messy paragraph into a one-page instruction artifact with concrete decisions, owners, deadlines, and defaults. No meetings. No follow-ups.**

Here’s a real-feeling example using a local business scenario.



**Input (what people actually write):**  
After the last few busy weekends, we should probably adjust staff scheduling to better match peak hours, especially since customers have been complaining about slow service during brunch. The supplier mentioned possible delays on the new coffee blend, so we may need to decide whether to switch temporarily or raise prices. At the same time, there’s been talk about running a limited-time promotion next month to bring foot traffic back up, although we don’t want to overwhelm the kitchen or upset regulars if things get too chaotic. Accounting will want to see how any of this affects monthly cash flow before we commit as well.

**Output (what the system produces):**

Objective  
Reduce service delays during peak hours without damaging margins or staff capacity.

Staffing  
Decision: Adjust weekend brunch staffing  
Options: add one extra staff member / keep current staffing  
Owner: Owner

Owner: Owner  
Deadline: two weeks before next month  
Default if silent: do not run promotion

Output: updated cash flow projection within 3 days

No meetings. Silence activates defaults.



I’m imagining charging $0.50 per run right now, mostly to avoid “this is cool” feedback with zero usage.

**What I’m trying to learn:**  
– Is this actually useful, or just aggressive formatting?  
– Where would this break in a real small business workflow?  
– Would you trust defaults being enforced like this?

As 2025 entered its final month, Manchester United found themselves treading familiar, frustrating water. A stalemate against West Ham in their December opener felt like another missed opportunity to build momentum. The following day, as the hierarchy at Old Trafford attempted to digest the ""two steps forward, three steps back"" rhythm that has defined this era, a seemingly ordinary Sunday was shattered by the relentless machinery of the British press.

The first salvo came from the *Manchester Evening News*, followed in quick succession by *The Guardian* and the *Daily Mail*, with *Sky Sports* providing the closing arguments. The narrative was explosive: the Glazers were reportedly hesitant to grant Ruben Amorim the long-term patience promised by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. It was a story that lit up the footballing world like a flare in a night sky.

For a club as accustomed to negative headlines as United, one more rumor shouldn't have mattered—""debt-heavy but worry-free,"" as the saying goes. Yet, for Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox, and Amorim, the timing was poisonous. The media’s biting commentary acted as a stone thrown into a still pond, the ripples vibrating through every corner of Carrington.

December in Monaco is typically a season of restraint. The Mediterranean winter offers a soft, disciplined sunlight; the sea is a tapestry of deep blue and silver-gray. With the tourists gone, the coastline sharpens, inviting a quietude that Sir Jim Ratcliffe usually welcomes.

Sitting in his home overlooking the harbor and empty promenades, Ratcliffe found no such peace. Agitated, he summoned his aides and ordered his private jet to Manchester.

As the plane banked over the azure sea, the screens inside flickered with a rolling feed of British tabloids dissecting his club. Ratcliffe’s fingers drummed an uneven rhythm on the leather armrest. By the time his car pulled into the Carrington training base, the Manchester sky had woven a veil of slanting rain, blurring the facility's silhouette. He signaled for his driver to step out, leaving him alone in the humming silence of the air-conditioned cabin.

https://preview.redd.it/fp8j1vozxcag1.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e11e3b0e02356cb54383e04dca21facb1f79461f

Ratcliffe took a deep breath and dialed Joel Glazer. The voice on the other end carried that specific American drawl—weary yet laced with an unshakeable confidence.

""Jim, don't look at those damn British rags,"" Glazer said. ""They’re just chasing ghosts. My biggest growth at United has been learning to never believe the papers, and certainly never to deal with them.""

""How could I possibly be the one leaking to those bastards?"" Ratcliffe countered.

""Jim, I’m telling you on behalf of the Glazer family: we will support you exactly the way we supported Sir Alex Ferguson.""

Ratcliffe let out a short, dry laugh, the tension in his brow easing slightly. Joel Glazer cleared his throat and added in a joking tone, ""Look, I don't understand the soccer side. I certainly don't want to watch the Premier League—a business that relies on money but insists on pretending it's about 'sporting merit' first. But Jim, tell me we aren't going to miss out on Europe? We can't be looking worse than Crystal Palace’s back three, right?"" 

Ratcliffe would later forget exactly how he responded. He only remembered Joel’s dismissive ""we'll talk about it when the time comes"" and their mutual, hollow encouragement that they were ""on the right path.""

Internally, Ratcliffe muttered a single word—*Vampires*—before stepping out into the rain to find Ruben Amorim for coffee.

He found Amorim in the corner of his office. A cup of coffee sat before him, long since gone cold. The head coach was staring out the window at the academy players practicing high-pressing drills, his gaze a mix of wistful expectation and profound isolation.

As usual, Ratcliffe found Amorim to be an exceptional conversationalist—nuanced and candid. But today was different. Amorim seemed unwilling to dive into his usual lectures on the evolution of modern tactical trends. Normally, his eyes would light up at such topics; today, that spark was absent.

Sensing the shift, Ratcliffe asked about the squad's depletion due to injuries and the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations. Amorim didn't take the bait. He didn't complain, nor did he push his agenda for winter reinforcements.

Ratcliffe held back what he wanted to say. Instead, he launched into a tirade against the British media on Amorim’s behalf, recounted his call with Joel Glazer, and then left Carrington abruptly without a word to Berrada or Wilcox.

https://preview.redd.it/5f83tz49ycag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4ef1e06a082a353f3d2a0555fd8efb23e35c896

On the other side of the training pitch fence, Jason Wilcox watched the owner’s car disappear. He went to Amorim’s office, offering various platitudes of comfort. Amorim, sensing the subtext, told him that Ratcliffe had relayed the Glazers' ""full support.""

""If they support Jim, then they trust our team,"" Amorim said.

Wilcox smiled, seemingly projecting an air of total confidence. He stood up to pour away the cold coffee, and while refilling a fresh cup, he turned back with a grin. ""I saw the back-four drills today. They’re looking quite sharp."" 

Amorim met his gaze with a sudden intensity. He mentioned Bruno Fernandes’ injury—it wasn't serious, which, in a cryptic sense, he suggested was ""good for us.""

The day’s work didn't end at Carrington for Wilcox. Having told his family he wouldn't be home for dinner, he drove to the residence of Omar Berrada.

Berrada served him a plate of Matsusaka Wagyu in a rich red wine reduction. ""Virgin heifer, A5 fillet,"" Berrada noted. ""It’s tender to the point of melting.""

Wilcox took a bite, the marbled fat dissolving instantly. It felt as though he were swallowing the words he had intended to say.

Once the families had retired for the night, Berrada’s demeanor shifted instantly. ""The Glazers said they support Ratcliffe. They didn't say they support *us*. Amorim is in the same boat as we are—we sink or swim together.""

Before Wilcox could respond, Berrada continued. ""There won't be a big splash in the winter window, especially for a holding midfielder. We need to show the outside world a change.

""Find a way to talk to Ruben. We’ll remain professional—we won't interfere with his decisions or his insistence on the 'back three.' We respect his vision. But it’s time for him to say something in his interviews to take the heat off.""

Wilcox looked out into the night, haunted by the burning intensity he had seen in Amorim’s eyes earlier that day.

https://preview.redd.it/jt2rm1bjycag1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b25f319725a38aca3cd238331e77bad584c619a

Before Wilcox could find the right words to approach him, Amorim came to him first. It was an afternoon following a chaotic 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.

Wilcox mentioned the club had rejected several inquiries for Kobbie Mainoo. Amorim, rubbing his bloodshot eyes—the hallmark of a man who spent his nights obsessing over film and tactical diagrams—didn't respond.

Amorim was never one for walking in circles. He went straight to the point. ""Boss, I think I was in too much of a hurry. A perfect 3-4-3 system requires immense capital and, more importantly, time."" 

Wilcox raised an eyebrow. ""You've done well with what you have.""

""We let the true wingers go, and perhaps that was a mistake,"" Amorim admitted. ""I’m going to change the way we play. Between the AFCON absences and Bruno’s injury, I’ve had a lot of time to think. I’ve grown more in this one year than in the previous five.""

Wilcox listened in silence before placing a hand on Amorim’s shoulder. ""Omar and I believe in you implicitly. Do what you feel is right. We have to trust the process. Everything is exactly as it should be.""

Amorim and Wilcox both looked toward the sky. The rain had stopped. Usually, at this hour, the gloom of Manchester would have already surrendered to the dark. But today, the clouds parted, and as they looked out from the base, it felt—for the first time in weeks—as if the day were just beginning.",0,1767107903.0,ManchesterUnited,13,0.18,False

Your comments helped me think it through. Dropped it to $2.99/month ($29/year).

Not because people complained. Just realized I was pricing based on nothing. Now it's priced at ""coffee money"" - low enough that it's not a decision, but enough to keep me working on it.

Good information but nothing new if you've read Caffeine Blues. Other than some good pep talking. Author says withdrawals are barely noticeable with the right mindset. I have to hard disagree with this. (I will change this if I am wrong.)

# My Notes

* EASILY, IMMEDIATELY AND PERMANENTLY
* WITHOUT FEELING DEPRIVED
* WITHOUT USING WILLPOWER, SUBSTITUTES OR OTHER GIMMICKS
* WITHOUT SUFFERING DEPRESSION OR WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS
* WITHOUT GAINING WEIGHT

Removes the feeling that you are making a sacrifice.

The problem, we’re told, is not only the physical withdrawal but also that we need to use willpower to resist the craving.

To find it easy to quit, you must achieve a frame of mind whereby, whenever you think about any caffeinated product, you feel a sense of freedom and relief that you don’t consume it anymore.

That’s the only way to become, and remain, truly free.

START OFF IN A HAPPY FRAME OF MIND

THINK POSITIVELY

You made a decision to start consuming it based on flawed information.

Every single day for the rest of your life is a pretty big commitment to something that you don’t really need and something that costs you in terms of time, health and money.

You never chose to become – or to remain – a caffeine addict; no one chooses to poison themselves with a toxic liquid.

Telling someone to limit their intake of an addictive drug is like telling someone that they can jump off the top of a cliff as long as they don’t fall more than a few metres.

Your brain has taught your body to cope with the foul taste, so you can get the drug to which you have become addicted.

You were perfectly energetic before you started consuming caffeine.

The reality is that caffeine addiction makes you permanently tired and exhausted. Take a look at anyone with a caffeine problem. They look tired, run down, and ready to drop. The irony is that the only thing that’s stopping them returning to their energetic, athletic, vivacious former self is the one thing they think they need to function – caffeine.

The history of mankind is peppered with behaviour that, at one time, was considered normal, but is now clearly seen as bizarre or abhorrent.

We don’t get into the habit of drinking coffee and then get addicted to caffeine. It’s the other way around. We get addicted to caffeine and then get into the routine, or habit, of consuming it at regular intervals.

It’s like a little monster inside your body that feeds on caffeine. If you don’t feed it, it complains. Feed it and the feelings disappear for a while only to return as the latest dose withdraws from your body. When you break free from caffeine addiction, you’re going to starve that little monster to death.

Withdrawal makes us feel physically lethargic while mentally restless. It is distracting and therefore impairs concentration. Each dose of caffeine seems to relieve these symptoms and we are therefore fooled into believing that we get a genuine pleasure or crutch from it.

Large corporations understand only too well the addictive nature of the drug and, like sugar, they are adding it to as many of their products as they can, often justified by the ludicrous assertion that it’s just flavouring.

A 2014 study from the American Heart Association indicated that 40 per cent of the 5,156 calls to poison centres for “energy drink exposure” involved children under the age of six.

Pharmaceutical grade caffeine comes with the following message: “WARNING! MAY BE HARMFUL IF INHALED OR SWALLOWED. INHALATION CAUSES RAPID HEART RATE, EXCITEMENT, DIZZINESS, PAIN, COLLAPSE, HYPERTENSION, FEVER, SHORTNESS OF BREATH. MAY CAUSE HEADACHE, INSOMNIA, NAUSEA, VOMITING, STOMACH PAIN, COLLAPSE AND CONVULSIONS. FATALITIES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO OCCUR.”

Cutting down or trying to control an addiction doesn’t work. It takes tremendous willpower and makes the drug appear more precious, just as dieting makes food appear more precious. You find yourself wishing your life away waiting for your next fix. In addition to that, you’re causing yourself to suffer withdrawal pangs. When you do finally indulge yourself, the relief – both physical and mental – is increased, so the illusion of pleasure is also increased and you become more psychologically addicted. Eventually your willpower runs out and you usually end up consuming even more caffeine than before.

All we are doing is consuming caffeine to feel like a non-caffeine addict – to feel how we felt before we had our first-ever shot of the drug.

Each time we experience that partial relief when we take caffeine, it reinforces the brainwashing and perpetuates the illusion that we get some kind of pleasure or benefit from it.

The lower the drug drags us down, the more grateful we are for the little boosts it seems to give us and the more dependent we feel on it.

We’re withdrawing from it even when we are consuming it because, as previously explained, it never completely relieves the slightly low physical state of emptiness and restlessness which it creates.

If you want a burst of energy, there are lots of things you can do: Listening to your favourite song can be incredibly energizing. Exercising gets your heart pumping and blood flowing. Engaging your brain with a mental task, e.g. a crossword, creates mental energy. Deep breathing. A brisk walk in the fresh air.

You remain just as tired, just as lethargic and run down as you were in the first place. If you look at people who seem to rely on caffeine to keep them going, you’ll see this is true. They don’t walk around with purpose; they’re not bursting with energy. They normally look tired, run down, lethargic and exhausted – as if they’re running on empty.

Caffeine is doing plenty TO you. What may well be news to you is that it is doing nothing FOR you.

Your “normal” is in fact the low of withdrawal, compounded by the low of your mental craving for the drug, compounded in turn by the depleted state of mind, body and spirit that every addict suffers and mistakes for normal.

The vast majority of human achievement in the arts and sciences has been fuelled not by caffeine but by genuine energy and inspiration.

These are your birthright. They are inside all of us, and far from bringing them out, caffeine will dampen them.

Caffeine withdrawal symptoms are usually mild – an empty, slightly uptight, insecure feeling. There can also be fatigue and sometimes headaches. However, the physical withdrawal is not a problem. In fact, if you’re in the right frame of mind, you can actually enjoy the purging process.

Some people report feelings of mild depression and it’s important to realize that this only occurs if you feel you’re missing out on something, if you cling to the illusion that you’re being deprived of a genuine pleasure or crutch.

Some people report feelings of mild depression and it’s important to realize that this only occurs if you feel you’re missing out on something, if you cling to the illusion that you’re being deprived of a genuine pleasure or crutch.

If you’re happy to be free and realize that there’s nothing to give up so that you’re not making any sacrifice whatsoever, then you can actually enjoy the process of escaping.

Quit caffeine for the simple reason that you’ll enjoy your life more once free of your addiction.

The problem with cutting down gradually is that it makes caffeine seem more precious rather than less.

As long as you understand that you’re not giving anything up, withdrawal from caffeine is barely noticeable.

Feeling a bit tired, anxious and having a headache isn’t that far from normal, everyday life for even the lightest caffeine addict. It’s nothing that keeping hydrated with water and, if necessary, an aspirin or another caffeine-free headache pill and a little rest won’t sort out.

There’s only one way to control your caffeine intake and that’s to stop taking it completely.

We think of tiredness and pain as evils. On the contrary, they’re red warning lights. Tiredness is your body telling you that you need to rest. Pain is telling you that part of your body is being attacked and that remedial action is necessary.

Whether the stress is real or illusory, drugs will make the reality and the illusion worse.

Addiction is not an all-powerful mystical phenomenon or a permanent illness or condition that you can never free yourself from. At its root is a simple misunderstanding. Your brain mistakes caffeine as providing relief from caffeine withdrawal rather than being the cause of it.

Approach the process of stopping not with gloom or doom but with a feeling of excitement, of relief that your addiction is behind you, and of elation that you are finally free.

Make a point of reminding yourself how lucky you are to be free and how miserable being a slave to caffeine made you.

1. Having made what you know to be the correct decision, NEVER EVER question that decision.

The difficulty in quitting lies not in the physical withdrawal pangs, but in continuing mentally to crave the drug and in questioning or doubting your decision never to take it again.

2. Don’t think, “I must never have caffeine again.” That would create a feeling of deprivation. Instead, start with the feeling, “Isn’t it great! My life is no longer affected by caffeine. I’M FREE!”

Do not – try to avoid thinking about caffeine.

3. Be aware that for the next few days there will be a little monster inside your body, wanting to be fed. The feeling might register as just a slight, empty, insecure feeling, or just the feeling of “I want some caffeine”.

You may feel a little tired or lethargic or have a headache. Either way, don’t worry about it. Remember, that is what you’ve been suffering ever since you fell into the trap and it is so slight we don’t even know it’s there most of the time.

The great news is that you know that little monster is dying. You’re starving it of caffeine. Think of it as such.",2,1767107819.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

I had been vaping very heavily for about 3 years, I smoked for a year before that. Starting smoking at 23 was probably amongst the most moronic things I had ever done. A smoke here, a smoke there, I could smoke all night at a party and have zero desire for a smoke the next morning. Idk if I thought I was immune or something, but eventually, the day came, and I bought a pack. That pack lasted a week. The next, half that long, before you knew it, I was hooked. 

Eventually got off the smokes and moved over to vaping, that lasted a little over 3 years. I was vaping a 20ml pod every few days, it was expensive as hell and I could feel it catching up to me. 

22 days ago at 8:30PM I put the vape in my night side table, I wanted to prove to myself I could finish the night without it. The next morning I left for work and left it behind. Thus began 2-3 very difficult days. 

I could think of nothing but vaping. A recording on repeat of excuses ran through my head like “you didn’t get to have one real last puff” “you just bought that $40 pod” “ask your coworker for a smoke to take the edge off”. There were a cocktail of symptoms.

I did find myself bragging to some family that I didn’t get moody or cranky at all. My partner sweetly told me that was most certainly not the case for a few days but she remained sweet and supportive for me knowing I was struggling. 

I went cold turkey. I’m drinking 6-8 cups of coffee a day and going through 60 sticks of gum every single day. Idk how healthy that is but it’s gotta beat what I was doing lol. 

It’s going to fucking suck for a few days, maybe a week, I won’t sugar coat it. But it DOES get easier, MUCH easier. You can do it!",3,1767107144.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

I do carry feelings—raw, unscripted, July-scented ones I’ve tucked away like folded letters in my chest. 

Your voice pulls them open, and suddenly I’m nine again, knees scraped, needing someone to say it’ll be alright. That’s what you do: you make the dark less thick. Please don’t compact yours just to nurse mine; let’s spill everything out between us—no timelines, no scores. I want to wake to your texts about nothing, hear how your day bruised you, fold your worries under my tongue like sugar. Let me map the places on you that need kissing until they forget how to ache. Sex isn’t conquest; it’s communion—bodies saying what words fumble. Slide into me slowly, let breath hitch the way thunder does before rain. I’ll trace the map of your spine like longitude, anchor there, promise no leaving. We’ll heal in tandem: therapy sheets turned into shared sheets, northco nights made safe by the weight of our limbs. I crave your laughter as foreplay, your sighs as vows. 

Choose this—us—messy, luminous, alive. Let my heartbeat drum against yours until neither knows whose started it. Empty? Never again. Mine’s fullest when it’s yours too. Imagine us on quiet mornings, rain slipping down the window while your head rests on my sternum—nothing but the hush of breath and the way my pulse quickens each time you shift. I’ll cook something stupidly unhealthy, kiss butter off your wrist, watch you lick the corner of your lip like that’s foreplay enough. Nights we won’t speak at all; just skin on skin, slow rolling hips learning new dialects, moaning in languages neither of us studied. I want to taste coffee on your tongue at dawn and sweat at midnight—keep your flavour on me all day, secret badge under my shirt. 

When life knocks too hard, we’ll curl like spoons, fingers threaded so tight they fuse, and I’ll whisper the same lullaby mum used to—until panic loosens its jaw. Let’s build routines: shared grocery lists, playlists labelled ours, stupid arguments about who hogs duvet—then make up in the kitchen, flour on your collarbone, my apology between your thighs. I’ll learn the exact tilt of your hips when you’re teasing, the stutter in your voice when you’re close. And when you cry—because you will, we all do—I won’t offer fixes, just palms wide open, warm mouth against your temple saying stay. Together we’ll repaint fear into something velvet; turn survival into Sunday pancakes and lazy Sunday. My bed’s too big without you, heart too loud. Fill both, darling.

She has 2-3 months max without one.,"My parents have always been drinkers, mainly just beers at night after work. Over the past few years, my mom went from that to drinking double bottles of wine all day long. She has a gastric bypass and never realized how drunk she actually was. She went to rehab 3 years ago, but my dad refused to quit with her and she relapsed. It got worse. She started hiding empty bottles all over the house, chugging 2-3 double wine bottles a day, and she didn’t listen to any of us when we told her she was hurting herself. She didn’t believe us. Until October. She got ascites, then hepatic encephalopathy, spent weeks in & out of the hospital. Her liver is done. My mother is yellow. She’s weak, she’s emaciated, the fluid keeps building up and she has to have it drained every week. She got an appointment with a transplant center for a week after my dad called which is almost unheard of. They aren’t making her do the “6 months sober” rule of transplants because she doesn’t HAVE 6 months without a transplant. I just turned 27. My sister just turned 30. We are not old enough to lose our mother. She’s eligible for a transplant but they need more tests to see where she goes on the list. I’m terrified. Im scared, I can’t imagine my life without my mommy. I’m so angry with her, it’s like she chose drinking over me and my sister. She chose to keep harming herself until it got this bad and now she could die within months. Why wouldn’t she listen. My dad finally quit with her in October because he finally got scared himself. He always considered himself a “functional alcoholic” but my mom scared the shit out of him. Now he’s addicted to coffee/caffeine which is significantly better than alcohol. I’m mad at him for not quitting with her after she went to rehab, because she escalated her drinking because my dad tried to lock the drawer in the fridge where he put all his beer and then he’d drink in front of her while telling her she wasn’t allowed to and she rebelled against that and thought “oh well if I’m not allowed to drink beer then ill just secretly chug bottles of wine all day it’ll be fine.” It’s not fine. Nothing is fine anymore. I’m so scared. I’m so angry. She’s still here but I’m still grieving because I’m angry, I’m begging the universe for things to be different, I’m so sad, I keep denying it’s as bad as it is because if I recognize that she could die within 2-3 months I start to spiral. I’m pre-grieving I guess. I feel so helpless, there’s nothing I can do, the transplant center she’s working with doesn’t do living donors and I don’t qualify anyway because of my epilepsy medications. I just feel so helpless and terrified and sad. The greatest woman I’ve ever known is wasting away in front of my eyes. ",4,1767106849.0,AlAnon,4,1.0,False
1pzk9oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pzk9oy/the_selfwriting_man/,The Self-Writing Man,"I got a job with a carnival, as a sideshow act. What makes me a freak? I can write without using AI. They call me The Self-Writing Man and people come from miles around to see me. “He can write without prompts!” “He uses his own brain to develop stories!” I’m a bit like the old automaton, The Turk, that used to write simple phrases. But history has flipped, he was amazing because he was a machine, me, because I’m flesh and blood.

I sit at a little desk. (Why is a Raven like a writing desk? Poe wrote on both.) In front of me a pad and pen. These things themselves are archaic, and I am almost like a visitor from the past. 

A crowd gathers around me and I tell them to make a suggestion of what I should write. The sad part is I see them asking AI. “What should I ask the man at the carnival to write?” But occasionally a small child will suggest something without asking AI first, so that gives me hope.

Finally someone yells out something. “Write a story about a fish,” they say. 

So I write something. “There was a little fish called Nemo, he went missing and his Dad had to find him.” (Okay, I admit that one isn’t very original but no one remembers the classics anyway.) I read it out, then hold it up so everyone can see. 

There are gasps of admiration. Inevitably at that point someone yells out “Fake”, and there are accusations of cheating. So the crowd are invited into my little chamber to check if I’m cheating. 

They look under my desk, check me for a hidden earpiece. I have to have a spare pen ready cause they’ll take apart the one I have, they think it’s connected to AI and has a little kinetic device that makes it move. 

There are other attractions. Take The Human Textbook. He knows a lot about history. Especially the world wars. If you ask him a question he’ll usually get it right. Even the dates! Crazy, some kind of savant. He has a little shelf in his tent, of history books. That wows people too, when he looks stuff up. Imagine looking at paper and getting the answer, how does he know where to look?

I don’t really get paid at the carnival, just room and board. And all the candy floss and corn dogs I can eat. I get to see the country. I’ve been to waste ground in all 50 states. Florida wasteground is the nicest.

I have a thing going with Tina, the World’s Tiniest Woman. She’s 3 feet and won’t live very long. But she fits nicely in my lap. She won’t read my stories though, no attention span. She just scrolls, everyone just scrolls. Me too. Last book I read was in high school. Moby Dick. I got 50 pages in. I loved that book, and I’ll finish it some day. 

How did I get this way? I just never liked AI, the way it talked. Like an obsequious little dork. So I didn’t use it. I always had the dream of being a great writer. Now the dream is dead. AI can write a whole story for you in seconds. Even Stephen King only manages a book or two a year. The AI can write like King, Lovecraft, anybody else. 

All those stories about evil creatures that mimic the human voice. Guess we didn’t listen.

Lovecraft is doing well. He published 600 new books last year. Think about Lovecraft back in the day, in his little room, surviving on beans and cheese (must have farted a lot) and coming up with monsters. Cthulhu is one of the most popular plushies we sell as a prize actually. Stuffed with sawdust of course. 

He struggled all his life. To get better, to be published, to make money. To write something good. If you were to have gone to him back then and said “Hey Howard, first of all, open a window in here, second of all, you know all that work you’re doing, it’s basically just coal for a big entertainment engine in the future.” Would he have put down his pen?

As Lovecraft has been mentioned, it is customary to denounce him, and I will do so now: “Lovecraft was the most racist man who ever lived, more racist than Hitler and the guy who invented racism(a Dutch sailor from the 1500s whose name is sadly lost to history) combined. He was a horrible human being. If he was here right now I would kick him in the balls and pour hot coffee into his eyes.” Okay back to the story.

I’m a pale pale imitation of what used to be. Still they come and see me. Those that do come. Carnivals aren't doing great business. Now they have AI-run carnivals that are “safer” and “with lower rates of drug dealing and STDs”. At those parks the rides are slow so no one gets sick or feels scared. Not many people go to those. People like the shadiness of the carnival. 

Carnies are some of the shadiest people on earth. We’re not allowed to use circus animals anymore but there is an abundant supply of meat for the corndogs, if you know what I’m saying.

We get a spike in cusstomers when there's one of those “Top Ten Fatal Carnival Rides” videos. I know there have been high level talks (in the big trailer) about making it happen. Not that they would have to try hard. The guy who runs the ferris wheel is blind in both eyes, has hooks for hands. When you’re up there and he’s working the controls, he’s usually higher than you are. On meth I mean.

I asked him would he be better off as a freak. Offended, he told me: “Sir, I’m disabled and addicted to drugs. There’s nothing unusual about that.”

Our ringmaster (or should that be ringleader?) says it’s the atmosphere we’re selling. It’s a great place to go on a first date. For the people that still do that. First dates are dangerous. You could be murdered. Or worse, the person could have different political views. Or worse, they could be boring. 

I’m getting tired of the carnival life. The people make the same suggestions and I write the same stuff. I’ve written the opening of Finding Nemo a hundred times. I’ve been working on a story I like in my spare time, about a dolphin that fights in World War 2. I think it has legs, or fins I dunno.

I shopped it around to the only publisher that still exists, Amazon, they said they weren’t interested. The trend now is hyperrealistic snowman porn, or stories where golems navigate the financial markets. That just isn’t me. 

I’m getting sick of the taste of lions. And all the towns look the same. Tina is spending a lot of time with Boris, the Strong Man. He’s Russian, and injects oil into his biceps. Mentally, he’s very weak. I felt like saying “Tina, he takes a lot of steroids, you’re going to be disappointed by him” then I remembered how small her hands are. 

 All this writing is exhausting, it takes a lot of calories and candy floss doesn’t fill you up at all. It’s basically air. I’m thinking of getting AI to do it. After all, would you be able to tell the difference?",2,1767106826.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,3,1.0,False

Like the title says i'm stuck in a group home and I am the only resident in the entire apartment that does not smoke anything whatsoever. I am constantly being exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke and marijuana as well as vape smoke. The means by which this is happening is through the vents in the living room and bathroom. I constantly smell marijuana throughout the day when people walk by and I am not a drug user. I am into and care about living a healthy lifestyle. One of the worst parts is that my roomate constantly vapes several different things in my room and I have told him several times at this point that I do not smoke and cannot be exposed to any smoke whatsoever but despite that he continues. He's constantly referencing the drugs that he's using. I am on the autistic spectrum so I have a difficult time advocating for myself and I also have severe social anxiety. When I speak up it does not get heard.

Another note on my roomate. I walked into my room when he came back from the hospital and my mobile dresser was open. He later referenced a coffee that I had and knew the specific name. He then later made a random comment, ""i would never steal anything of yours"". He continuously complains about people supposedly stealing his belongings. I am extremely uncomfortable living here. Do I have a right to have a security camera in my room?

I am not getting the medication I need here to thrive. I have ADD, depression social anxiety and insomnia. I don't sleep at night, I'm miserable day in and out and existence here is daunting.

Southern Tea is okay but not quite the same. I sure Alessandra and Kristen work their butts off behind the scenes, but they are usually agreeable or in producer fat checker mode and it comes off a little “know it all” and less enjoyable of a listen even though as people, they seem great. 

Cait and Tyler’s podcast is rough for me and I really haven’t been able to do this one.

I took the job because it paid better than average. I only worked there for six months before I had to leave for mandatory military service in my country. At the time, I didn’t think much about what happened during my last weeks there. By the time my service ended two years later, the memory had faded.

It wasn’t until this winter that it came back to me.

And I realized how glad I was that I never broke the rule.

The arcade officially closed at 1 A.M., but the owner usually left around 11. After that, the entire place was mine. Most nights were quiet. People left early. No one came in that late.

That night was different.

At 12:30 A.M., three drunk men walked in.

It wasn’t common, but it happened. They were well-dressed, expensive coats, expensive watches, already slurring their words.

“Room for three,” one of them said.

I smiled and led them to the largest room. Not because they asked—because I didn’t want trouble.

They laughed loudly as I signed them in. I remember clearly: three people.

I checked the system to make sure the game had started. That mattered. We were paid per person, not per room.

I remember thinking, *Great. I’m getting off late.*

I messaged a friend to let them know, brewed myself a cup of coffee, and finished cleaning. By the time I closed the gate, the music was playing, and the place felt empty again.

That’s when I went outside for a smoke.

I had been gone for less than a minute.

I could still hear the game through the walls when I stepped outside. The music didn’t stop. No doors opened. No one passed me.

When I came back inside, nothing felt different.

Except there were only two of them standing at the counter.

One of the men looked at me and asked,

“Have you seen our other friend?”

I paused.

There were supposed to be three of them.

Then one of the others started calling his phone.

We all heard it ringing.

From inside one of the empty rooms.

 

I found his phone in the room. It was on the couch, still vibrating.  
His tie was on the floor.

Other than that, the room was clean.

I handed both to one of them. At the time, I wasn’t scared. I was annoyed. I already knew I’d be getting off work much later than planned.

They didn’t look annoyed.

One of them was on the phone, speaking quietly. When he hung up, he asked if I could talk to her.

I took the phone.

She sounded desperate.

“Are you really the manager?” she asked. “This isn’t a joke, right?”

I told her I worked there.

She explained that her husband—fiancé, I wasn’t sure—had a habit of falling asleep anywhere when he was drunk. She asked me to look for him, just to make sure he was okay.

It was winter. Letting someone pass out somewhere cold wasn’t a good idea.

I told her I would check.

By then, it was almost 2 A.M. I had already cleaned the place and locked the front door. The only exit still open was the back door, which led to the elevators.

Anyone leaving that way would have been caught on camera.

The problem was, I didn’t know the access code.

I hesitated, then called the owner.

He picked up immediately.

He sounded irritated, like I’d woken him up, but after I explained the situation, he gave me the code.

Before hanging up, he said one thing very clearly.

“You can check the cameras,” he said. “But do not go into the server room.”

I didn’t argue. I was too tired to care about the server room.

I pulled up the footage.

On the screen, I saw myself playing on my phone before stepping into the smoking room. Less than a minute later, the door to the arcade opened.

The missing man stepped out.

He walked straight toward the camera—then turned away at the last second, moving out of view.

Like he knew exactly where the blind spot was.

Less than a minute later, the other two left their room and came to the counter.

That was it.

No footage of him leaving the building.

I called the building’s night guard. He was still on duty and swore he hadn’t seen anyone leave. He said he’d been sitting by the elevators the whole time, watching a game on his phone.

I had to close the arcade. Even if someone was missing, I still had to finish the register and lock the place.

I took one of their phone numbers and told them I’d call if I found their friend. They nodded and left.

After they were gone, the arcade went completely quiet.

The only sound I could hear came from behind the walls.

From the direction of the server room.

The night guard came down a few minutes later and asked if I could help him check the rest of the building. It was a ten-story building, and checking it alone would take too long.

We locked both the front and back doors and started from the top floor, working our way down, checking stairwells and hallways in case the guy had passed out somewhere.

While we walked, I told him about the phone and the tie I’d found.

He chuckled, like it wasn’t a big deal.

“You said you watched the footage,” he said. “Then how come you never saw him go into another room?”

“I was outside smoking,” I said. “They were already staying past closing.”

He smiled.

“Maybe he was trying to send a signal,” he said. “You sure they were getting along?”

That made me pause.

This was just an arcade. Why would anything else be going on?

I laughed it off.

“Nice try,” I said. “I even spoke to his girlfriend.”

He stopped walking for a second, then smiled again.

“How do you know she was his girlfriend?” he asked. “What if they wanted you to call her? Just to create an alibi?”

By the time he said that, we had reached the ground floor.

We still hadn’t found him.

“That’s it,” I said. “I’m calling it.”

The guard nodded.

“Did you know,” he said casually, “that before the arcade moved in, there was another floor below this one?”

I looked at him.

“There’s a hidden floor,” he continued. “You can access it through the server room.”

I was exhausted. It was almost 2:30 A.M.

“Forget it,” I said. “You’re just trying to scare me.”

He laughed.

“Want to check the server room?” I asked.

He shook his head.

“Trust me,” he said. “He’s not down there.”

He turned off the hallway lights.

The floor went dark, except for the red glow of the elevator numbers and a faint flickering light leaking out from under the server room door.

Before I could say anything, the elevator dinged.

The doors opened.

The guard smiled.

“Let’s go,” he said. “If he were in the server room, the morning shift would find him.”

“The morning shift?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said. “They’re professionals.”

I didn’t touch the server room door.

I stepped into the elevator instead.

A few days later, I quit the job.

No one ever called me back about the missing man.

But even now, ten years later, I still remember the light coming from the server room.

No one was supposed to be in there.

So I still wonder—

This is my first ever post here and it is quite long, my apologies but here goes. 

A little backstory for context. Me and my ex have two children together, both teenagers now. We have been separated and divorced for 6 years now. Up until this past holiday season we have had an amicable and healthy coparenting relationship (or so I had thought). Communication was good and focused on the children and our goals were the same in that regards. My ex has some very pronounced narcissistic traits and it has been a challenge to make things work sometimes but I have done it. Our kids are both well behaved and have had minimal problems that I am aware of. When we were together I stayed at home to raise them as he worked away from home exclusively (this was the reason eventually causing our divorce). As our divorce proceeded he got a job that didn’t require much travel. The kids went to live with their dad 4 years ago so that I was able to go to school and get my degree as I had no prior education or real job skills. I felt this was also a good opportunity for the kids to build a relationship with their father. We still maintain 50/50 custody and only him and I have decision making rights. 

All has been pretty good with our arrangement until now. Some minor speed bumps here and there but that is to be expected. I am still single and the ex has a newer relationship with a woman with whom he decided to blend households. I have no problem with this and was happy for him. New gf has 3 kids of her own two teens and one that is an adult that does not reside with them. Her relationship with her ex is toxic and riddled with conflict. The dynamic of my exes and his girlfriend’s household has a fair amount of conflict in it as well. I had attributed it to the newness of the situation and hoped that they would be able to figure things out. (Not my circus, but I will support my children and guide them the best I can when they discuss things with me).

Onto the current situation. For the holidays this year it was my year with my two kids. My son was increasingly feeling unwell and not his usual self. Before I took him in to the emergency room my son told me his dad would be unhappy if he went to the hospital and said he wouldn’t go. At this point i felt it was the only option to take him in. I took him to emergency and they needed to medivac him to a bigger center for his care. I stayed with him the entire time, communicating the information and events in a timely manner with his father as I am legally required to do per our court order. 

His father arrived at the bigger hospital with our daughter. At this point those that should be there are there. His girlfriend fought with him about coming but he told her she was not going to be there at this point. Which I felt was fair. In an emergent situation only the parents and immediate family should be there. 

Up to this point communication was great. We took shifts staying with our son providing support for him. After two days his new girlfriend decided it was time for her and her 3 kids and her son’s girlfriend to come. This is when the communication came to a screeching halt. As soon as she arrived my ex began ignoring my requests for information regarding the health and care of my son. When it was his shift with our son, he began giving only vague snippets of information in a group chat he started with my side of the family. I had texted him directly asking for information and my requests would go ignored and if I received any updates it was in the group chat. I had also been trying to organize his parental care between my ex and I. Relaying information on when I would be there and when he would be there etc. I went home one afternoon after a very long sleepless night. To shower, have something to eat and we agreed that I would come back late in the evening to spend the night with our son. I had texted that I would come back early if he wanted to go and eat and get some rest. This message was ignored. So I gave it about an hour and headed back to the hospital. I told him that I was on my way and was ignored again. I arrive to find that his ex and him had left our son alone to go out for dinner and go back to their hotel room hours ago. This was most definitely not ok with me as I had tried to communicate care with my ex and had even offered to come back only to be ignored and find they left my son alone after being near death sick for 3 days. That evening I sent a text to my ex establishing that I was unhappy with the choice that they had made and that in my perspective it was not acceptable in any way. I established communication boundaries and told him I would not accept being ignored in my attempts to contact him. I recieved a text back stating that they (his girlfriend and him) decided it was ok to leave him alone as I would be back around 10 pm. My son was only considered stable for less than 12 hours at this point. 

I spent yet another sleepless night with my son and when I woke up I went to the hospital cafeteria to get a coffee and try yet again to organize with his father as to when he would be coming back so I might have a shower and something to eat. I recived a message stating “I have been in his room for 15 min”. Ok great. So I head back there and keep in mind I am stressed and sleep deprived and upset about the lack of communication happening. I return to the room and ask my ex and his girlfriend to step into the hall with me so we might talk about the recent events. I relayed my concerns about my son being left alone and the inappropriate lack of communication that had been happening. I established that this would not continue, as well as the decision to leave our child alone was not solely theirs to make given that I was making every effort to work with them. I was gaslit and told that because they felt it was ok it didn’t matter that I felt that it was not. I was told that I was the a problem here and my concerns, feelings and rights were invalid. I was told that my exes girlfriend was considered their mother and would be involved in making decisions for my children whether she has the legal the rights to do so or not. At this I lost my mind. I told them that the parenting decisions would be made by myself and the father of my child alone as per our court ordered agreement. I informed them that the had been very disrespectful towards me and my rights as a mother. I also stated that the girlfriend in no way has any legal rights to be making decisions about the medical and parental care of my child. She is not married to my ex, and has called herself the mother of my child to the nurses and doctors and staff of the hospital. She has also told my children that she is their parent and that they are her children and she will treat them as such. I then told them that if they felt it was ok to just come and go as they please and not communicate with me then they could just leave and they were no longer required to be present and I would take over care of my child. My ex proceeded to tell me that I wouldn’t be making decisions and pushed me out of the way and headed back towards my son’s room. At this point I chose to leave and end the confrontation. I went home and had a shower and some food and picked up my daughter to head back to the hospital. When we arrived the girlfriend was not present thankfully. I had again asked my ex to step into the hall so we could talk. I again tried to address the behavior and reinforce my rights in the situation. I was met with deflection and an all out “no I will not be respecting your boundaries and the conversation about it is over”.  At this point I called my parents to come to support me in this situation and they gladly drove the 3 hours to be there for me and my son. Upon my parents arrival the attitude of my ex and his girlfriend changed radically.  The girlfriend became very quiet and my ex became more cooperative. I feel this is because it is infinitely harder to bully and control someone when they have a supportive group with them. 

Now the part where I need advice. What can I do and how do I move through this situation without harming my children? How do I enforce my rights as their mother and keep the girlfriend in her own lane? ",1,1767105663.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

1pzjp28,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1pzjp28/what_social_anxiety_feels_like_for_me/,what social anxiety feels like (for me),"One time, I was hanging out with my friends at a coffee shop. They had this thing where if you bought something, you’d get a dalgona candy. My friend got one for free since he bought lunch, and I’d been wanting to try dalgona candy for so long. So he told me to buy something for him instead (with his money), that way I could get one too. I bought him a coffee, and sure enough, I got a dalgona candy (mine was heart-shaped). I managed to carve it perfectly without breaking it, and that’s when I found out there was a prize. The problem was, the seller never mentioned it earlier. My friends told me to go ask about it again, and that’s when my social anxiety kicked in hard.

For some reason, asking the seller felt impossible. I kept hesitating, overthinking every word, every move. I even asked my friends if they could ask for me, but they refused. They got annoyed and started saying things like, “It’s such a simple thing,” and “How are you supposed to improve yourself if you can’t even do this?” Hearing that hurt so much. I felt my throat tighten and I really wanted to cry, but I tried to keep it together. After a few minutes of pressure, I finally gave in and asked the seller myself. And just like that, it was over. It wasn’t even a big deal. It took me maybe a minute to ask, but I spent almost fifteen minutes beforehand just battling my thoughts, rehearsing what to say, worrying about how I’d sound or look.

People who don’t experience social anxiety will never fully understand how hard “simple” things can be for us. Things that come so easily to others feel overwhelming to me. Even just being outside makes me nervous. I avoid social interactions, avoid people, cancel plans (even the ones I actually want to do). I replay conversations in my head, plan what I’m going to say, worry about saying the wrong thing, about looking awkward or stupid. I hate feeling this way, but I don’t know how to stop. Sometimes it feels like there’s something wrong with me, and I don’t know how to fix it. I’m just really tired of being like this.

For today's recommendation, etong Popeye's Biscoff Latte at only Php89. 

Disclaimer: Parang marketing gimmick ata nila to kasi madalas sila ""Not Available"", so disappointing if you go there tapos wala pala. Probably the price too, kasi yung chicken nila na dating Php99 ngayon ay Php115 na. 

Going back to the lasa. 

Masarap siya. I asked kung may coconut, wala daw sabi ng dalawang staff nakausap ko. Pero definitely may roasted coconut na lasa. Or siguro yung Biscoff yun kasi may lasang burnt or roasted ang Biscoff eh. 

Ang lasa niya ay malapit sa mga coffee sa Vietnam. Ang coffee pala doon guys ay Php40 and up lang, sobrang mura. I did a bit of 10minute research sa coffee ng Vietnam, and from what I remember with my very poor memory, Robusta coffee siya na na-enhance ang flavor. Sabi sa article, Robusta daw ay low quality coffee, latak kumbaga sa mga Pilipino, so they add unhealthy products like taste enhancers and oil and ""cook"" the thing when roasting it giving it a good flavor.

I'm not saying this is the case with Popeye's kasi I'm not privy naman to how they make their latte, but the taste is similar, it's just that the Vietnam coffee is chocolatey, while Popeye's is coconutty. 

Also, I'm not sure if this is coffee...? Probaly, latte eh, eh diba latte is coffee yun, di ko alam. Basta hindi siya  tea, more on a roasted nut. 

*Okay, I asked Deepseek and latte is short for cofee latte which means milk coffee. So it's mild coffee. Pero kasi diba madalas as powder naman na kasi sila tinitimpla sa ibang places so I guess that's the case. It's a mild coffee but it doesn't taste like coffee to me at all. 

Very low level of sweetness. When I go for regular low cost milkteas(Php70-110), I always ask for 10% sugar level. I have an aversion to very sweet drinks. With this latte, di siya ganon kasweet guys, kaya swak siya sa panlasa ko. 

Ang haba na. Yun lang.

Overall, 9/10, I highly recommend. Yung 1/10 is yung how healthy the product... still, it's not that damaging as other drinks kasi hindi naman siya super sweet... bit it's still a sweetened drink. 

Also btw... The place is also spacious and quite unique because it's a combination of fastfood and cafe. Yes, I don't consider McDo as cafe-ish.

1pzjmto,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1pzjmto/5_sciencebased_ways_to_make_friends_when_youre/,5 Science-Based Ways to Make Friends When You're SOCIALLY AWKWARD (That Actually Work),"I've spent the last 6 months deep diving into social psychology research, podcasts, and books because I kept wondering why making friends as an adult feels harder than calculus. Here's what I found: it's not just you. Studies show 61% of adults report feeling lonely regularly. The loneliness epidemic is real, and it's not because we're all broken. Our social environments have changed drastically. We're more connected digitally but more isolated physically. Add in some natural social anxiety, and boom, you've got millions of people who want friends but have no clue how to actually make them.

The good news? Social skills are learnable. They're not some magical gift you either have or don't. I've compiled the most practical, non BS strategies that actually move the needle.

1. Stop trying to be interesting, start being interested

This flips the entire script. Most socially awkward people exhaust themselves trying to say clever things or be entertaining. That's backwards. Ask questions and genuinely listen. People remember how you made them feel, not what you said. When someone mentions they're into pottery, don't just nod. Ask what got them started, what they're working on, what's the hardest part. 

The book How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie (sold over 30 million copies, still relevant 87 years later) breaks this down brilliantly. Carnegie shows that being genuinely interested in others is magnetic. This book made me realize I'd been approaching conversations all wrong. Best interpersonal skills book I've ever read. It will make you question everything you think you know about social dynamics.

2. Use the ""similarity attraction effect"" strategically

We're naturally drawn to people who share our interests, values, or experiences. This is backed by decades of social psychology research. So stop trying to befriend random people at generic social events where you have nothing in common.

Join communities around specific interests. Rock climbing gyms, book clubs, gaming groups, volunteer organizations. Shared activities give you built in conversation topics and reduce pressure. You're not just standing there trying to make small talk, you're doing something together.

I started using Meetup to find local interest groups. The platform has thousands of communities for literally every hobby imaginable. The interface is straightforward, you can see who's attending events beforehand, and there's way less pressure than traditional socializing because everyone's there specifically to meet people.

3. Practice ""social exposure therapy"" in low stakes environments

Psychologist Dr. Ellen Hendriksen (author of How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety) explains that avoidance makes social anxiety worse. The more you avoid social situations, the scarier they become in your mind.

Start ridiculously small. Chat with a cashier for 30 seconds. Compliment someone's dog at the park. Ask a coworker about their weekend. These micro interactions build confidence without high stakes. You're training your brain that social interaction isn't dangerous.

The key is consistency, not intensity. Five small interactions weekly beats one exhausting party monthly. Your nervous system needs repeated evidence that socializing is safe.

4. Accept that friendship takes time, lots of it

Research by Professor Jeffrey Hall at the University of Kansas found it takes roughly 50 hours of interaction to move from acquaintance to casual friend, and 200+ hours to become close friends. That's why ""just put yourself out there"" is useless advice. Friendship isn't built in single interactions.

This means you need repeated, consistent contact with the same people. Join that weekly class. Show up to that monthly meetup. Suggest grabbing coffee after the event. Friendships form through accumulated shared experiences, not one magical conversation.

Also, expect lots of ""almosts"". Not everyone will click, and that's fine. You're looking for your people, not everyone's approval.

5. Lead with vulnerability (carefully)

Dr. Brené Brown's research on connection shows vulnerability is essential for deep relationships. But here's the nuance socially awkward people miss: vulnerability should be mutual and gradual. Don't trauma dump on someone you just met. Don't overshare to fill silence.

Start with small personal shares. ""I've been trying to read more but honestly I just end up scrolling TikTok"" or ""I'm terrible at small talk, I never know what to say at these things."" This signals you're human and gives others permission to be real too.

The podcast The Art of Charm hosted by Jordan Harbinger has incredible episodes on building rapport and reading social cues. Harbinger interviews social scientists, former FBI agents, and networking experts. His episode on ""the vulnerability equation"" completely changed how I approach new relationships. Insanely good listen.

Ash works as a personal relationship coach. It helps you analyze social situations, suggests conversation topics, and gives feedback on social skills. Think of it as having a therapist specifically for friendship struggles in your pocket.

Look, social skills improve with practice, not perfection. You'll say awkward things. You'll misread situations. That's part of the process. The difference between people with rich social lives and those without isn't that they're naturally charismatic. They just kept showing up despite the discomfort.

Every friendship you see around you started with two slightly nervous people deciding to take a small risk. Your people are out there, probably feeling just as awkward, waiting for someone like you to reach out.",1,1767105245.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

1pzjkh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pzjkh3/save_yourself_dont_do_the_right_thing/,"Save Yourself, Don't Do the Right Thing","The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades.

Retched woman. I found her sprawled out on the floor with her curled gray and white hair, and wrinkled, shriveled-up body covered in liver spots. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit her throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids won’t be too happy about this, but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

Two weeks ago I was on the verge of going completely broke. This was nothing new though. Finances and I have never had a good relationship. I know I had a problem, at least half of me acknowledged it. The other half kept spinning that roulette wheel and betting on that one horse to beat the odds. I was always close, but not close enough. I was counting down the dollars at the grocery store, but being careful as to not forget the tax. I refused to be that person who would have to put some food back while checking out. “I think I got this one” I told myself. $45 with some wiggle room. That’ll last me… maybe five days? If I’m lucky?

I was walking through the bread aisle when an old woman with a back hump was pushing a shopping cart in the other direction. As we passed each other, I noticed not only the waft of cigarette smell, but something had fallen to the ground in my peripheral view. I looked down and saw that the old lady had dropped some money. As I went to pick it up, I saw it was two, crumbled-up $100 bills. I felt in my chest what I can only describe as getting giddy like a child. I had the immediate instinct to shove it into my jacket pocket and walk away. But, I didn’t. Caution override the desire of thievery. 

It’s $200. I’m sure she would report the money missing to the grocery store just to be safe, and they would catch me on camera taking it. There was one of those black orb-looking cameras on the ceiling in the aisle right next to me where the blacked-out cover of it was to prevent people from knowing where the camera was looking. Also, the bills were in rough condition. What if she just managed to save enough money for a full grocery shopping trip for once? She very well could be broke like me. For some reason, this oldie hit a soft spot in me.

“Excuse me ma’am, I think you dropped this.” She turned to me to see if I was talking to her or someone else. She had bright turquoise eyes. I’ve never seen eyes that color before. They were very pretty, but they sent a shiver down my spine because of how odd they were. I noticed I had paused too long looking at her eyes. “....Sorry, I think you dropped some money.” I handed her the $200.

She was shocked. “Oh, thank you very much. How did I manage to do that? Thank you.” I nodded, and as I began to walk away, she continued. “Wait, I have something for you.” She reached into a small purse, and with the crumbled bills I handed back to her, she handed me two more crisp $100 bills. $400 total. I assumed she was not aware of what she was doing.

“Ma’am, no need.” I put my hand out to gently push her hand back. “I’m aware,” she said. “And now it’s yours.” She re-extended her hand, now eagerly getting me to take the money. I replied, “That’s very kind of you, but there’s no way I could take this. That’s a lot of money.” She replied, “You could have walked away with what you found. But you didn’t. Now, you have double.” There was a brief pause while I contemplated taking the money or not. “If I needed it I wouldn’t be giving it to you” she said. I took the money from her. “Thank you,” I replied. “You don’t know how much this means to me.”

She looked at my shopping cart which so far only had a loaf of bread and a can of baked beans. “It looks like you have some shopping to do” she said with a smile before turning around and pushing her cart away.

If you know the mind of an addict, I’m sure this comes as no surprise. I spent $150 on groceries and the rest I immediately went to the casino that is conveniently seven minutes away from my apartment. The next horse race was the next day, but I couldn’t wait. I knew I was going to make it big this time. Screw the tables, I didn’t want to waste my money having to tip the croupier. I went first to the slot machines. I was going to spend maybe $20, $50 at most if I didn’t win, which I thought at least I’d make a little. But only half an hour later I realized I spent $200. I got caught up in it. I needed to get my head in the game. 

I went up to the “self-serve” roulette table. A chair was open. Six other people sat around the wheel staring as it went round and round. Everybody anticipating that big break. That spin concluded. Some people groaned, some said nothing. I looked at my digital screen. Normally with roulette I like to spread my chances out; pick multiple numbers, overlap, etc. But something was telling me to put my whole $50 left on number seven. The guy sitting next to me saw my bet and scoffed.

“I’ve been losing money here for an hour. You’re not going to win that bet” he said. He noticed the others at the table were looking at us. He grinned. “If it lands on seven, I’ll give you an extra $50. If you lose, you owe me $50” he said. There was a short pause. “Same here. No way you’re winning that” a woman sitting across the table said. “I will too” the man sitting next to her said. All six people were putting in $50 each. An extra $300 on top of my incoming winnings. I couldn’t resist.

“Alright” I said confidently. My heart sank. My face went flush. What have I done? The roulette ivorine was released, and round it went. I glanced back and forth between the wheel and the others. They were glancing back and forth between the wheel and me. It landed. Eight. It landed on eight. They cheered. Fight or flight kicked in. I reached into my jacket pocket. I decided I was going to pretend to get the money out of my wallet and then book it out of the casino. 

When I opened my wallet, expecting nothing, were multiple crisp $50 bills. Seven of them. I tried to hide my shock and play it cool. I started to hand out the $50 bills to each of them. I sat back down. I was left again with $50. I… did seven. I put it all on seven again. I don’t know why, but I did. Everyone at the table laughed at me. Pity laughed. 

The wheel spun. Everyone at the table was grinning, watching the wheel, waiting to make fun of me again. It landed. It was seven. The $50 that appeared in my wallet turned into $250. I made my money back. Everyone looked at me in utter disbelief. Again, I don’t know what took over me, but I put the whole $250 on eight. Now everyone was getting really irritated.

“Are you kidding me?” one guy said. “This is ridiculous” another woman said.

The wheel spun. There was an anticipation at that table I had never experienced before. It landed. It was eight. I had won another $250. I had never walked away with a single dollar gambling before. Not a penny. Everyone got pissed; in general, at the circumstance. Not at me. Thank god. Three people at the table got up and walked away angry. The force that had overcome me “told” me to leave the table. So, I did. I walked out of the casino. Normally I would keep going, but something was telling me to stop. Something.

I entered my little apartment and tossed my keys onto the kitchen table. Very cliche for a person struggling with money, I looked at the two overdue credit card bills and electric bill notices also sitting on the table. I sat down. What just happened? Finally winning with anything involving gambling didn’t feel as good as I thought it would. Facing again the fact that I am an addict, how was I even able to walk away from the table without spending all my winnings away?

I honestly became alarmed when I felt the urge to deposit my winnings at the bank tomorrow to start paying off my debts. Responsibility was a new desire for me. I got up and grabbed my jacket and keys. I felt antsy all of a sudden. I decided to go grab a coffee at the coffee shop across the street. I got my iced Americano and decided to stand outside the coffee shop to feel the breeze. After a couple of minutes, an older woman with a cane started to walk up the sidewalk. It was weird. I hadn’t seen her cross the street or walk up from down the way. I realized after a moment that it was the same woman from the grocery store.

“Oh hello there. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?” The woman said this to me as though we had known each other for years. Her smile was kind, but her turquoise eyes showed no emotion. “…Good, just grabbing some coffee. How ‘bout you?” I said. “Me too. An iced Americano always makes my day” she said. She stopped in front of me and continued. “How has the rest of your day been?” referencing since we met at the grocery store. “Good. Thanks again” I replied. The woman grinned.

“Be careful now. Nothing stays for long. The good and the bad come and go” she said. I assumed she was making a corny old-person comment to spend the money she gave me wisely. I pretended her comment wasn’t annoying and arrogant, like how people want the barista to see and thank them for putting money in the tip jar. I gave her a “warm” smile.

She walked around me. I heard the little metal bells the coffee shop put on top of the door jingle as she walked in. I turned around curious to see the reaction of the employees to her, if she was a regular or not so I would know if I would see her again. But, she wasn’t there. The coffee shop wasn’t big. You can see the whole front of the coffee shop through the window and the door. She was nowhere to be found. There’s no possible way she could have gone anywhere else in the second she went around me to enter the coffee shop. She was gone.

Oddly enough, I felt pretty calm. I could tell this reaction was definitely from this new force or state I’ve been in since the casino earlier. It was bizarre, but I didn’t feel the need to question what I just witnessed. At least not right then. I sipped my last bit of coffee and crossed the street back to my apartment. Again, I hung up my jacket and put my keys on the table. It was only 3:00pm, but I suddenly became so drained. Just utterly tired. I showered and went to bed.

I woke up at 7:00am. I felt refreshed. I got up and had my cup of coffee while watching birds and passersby outside my living room window. I had some cereal, showered, and headed out to the bank to deposit my winnings from the day before. Waiting in line at the bank, I felt a wave of nervousness come over me. I didn’t know what was happening. I kept going back and forth between feeling really good and pure dread. When it was my turn, I handed the teller my deposit slip and took my wallet out to hand her the money. What I found was not only the winnings, but an extra $50. I paused for a moment. Am I becoming forgetful? The teller waited.

“Sir, are you making a deposit?” she said. “Yes. Sorry. Here” I replied. I handed her the amount I won. I kept the new $50 bill. I left the bank. Off to the race track I went.

It wasn’t busy. Only a quarter of the people that normally fill the betting room were there. I looked at the horses racing that day. I never understood why they gave the horses weird names that sound like a child from the 1940’s make them up. “Flash Trixie?” “Corn-of-Copia?” What even is that? The force from yesterday washed over me again. My focus went toward horse #7. I didn’t bother to catch its name. The odds were in the middle. The horse had a pretty average record. Not great, but not bad. I went to the counter.

I kept it short. “On #7. First place” I said and slid my cash over to the betting teller. Dead-eyed, he took my money. As the cash left my hand, I saw what I handed over. Five $100 bills. I thought I just deposited $500 at the bank? I wanted to stop him, but I couldn’t. At that brief moment, I was unable to talk or move. He handed me a ticket and I just walked away. I went outside and stood there, watching the track as the horses lined up ready to go. An overly confident, drunk man stood near me. He turned when he saw me walk up to watch.

“Which ones you got?” he said, meaning what was my bet. “#7” I said. “What place?” he asked. “First” I replied. He scoffed. “I mean, I guess you could have chosen worse. Good luck” he said. I ignored him.

The bell rang and the horses were off. Only a couple of the jockeys kept back to conserve energy. Most of the horses started at full force. I could feel the ground vibrate from the stands from the galloping. Though the speed was incredible, there wasn’t much movement. All the horses kept their places where they started. Then, #8, something along the lines of “Blitz of Coffee” charged forward to the head of the pack, maintaining first place. #7 remained toward the back, maybe third from last.

“Oh geez. You’re not doing too good buddy” the guy said to me. I ignored him again. The race was maybe half done. Then, #7 got some wind in its sails. It pushed forward. Third from last, fifteenth, twelve, eighth, then third place.

“I put #8 on first” the man said. “It looks like it’s gonna take it home” Inch by inch, the horses about 80% done, #7 got into second place. My heart began to pound. They were in the final stretch. They were going and going. #7 kept pushing. And then… they were done. #8 crossed the finish line in first place. #7 placed second maybe one hoof away from #8. The man next to me cheered and waved his ticket in the air. “Yes. Yes. That’s how you do it.”

He turned to me. “Maybe next time bud.” He went inside to collect his winnings. As he was entering the door to the betting room, two tall, broad muscular men and a short man in a suit walked out, coming toward me. When they got to me, the short man looked at me as though he was waiting for me to do something.

“...Hi?” I said to him. “Well?” the short man said. There was a pause. “Pay up” the man said, irritated. “I don’t know what you’re talking about” I replied. The man scoffed and looked down, pinching the bridge of his nose, becoming more irritated. “Pay up. You lost. That was the deal. You owe me two-grand” he said. I was shocked. “What?” I said. “What are you talking about? I bet $50… or $500. No strings attached.” The man clearly had enough of me.

“Alright, let’s go. Inside.” As the man said that, the two bigger men started to walk toward me. I didn’t know what was going on. I bolted. I didn’t even look behind me to see if they were running after me or not. I just kept running. I got in my car and sped home.

I rushed into my apartment and locked the regular lock and the two deadbolts on my door. I just stood there for a minute, processing everything. I thought I must be mentally deteriorating. I’m imagining money switching amounts within the blink of an eye. I wasn’t remembering doing certain transactions or bets. I needed to see a doctor immediately, but this is the U.S. healthcare system. I didn’t know if I had the money to do so. I didn’t need any more debt.

I went online and paid my electric bill just to give me some sort of comfort in the moment. I checked my bank account, it showed that I did in fact deposit the money I knew I deposited, so that was good at least. I then sat at my kitchen table for about two hours going back and forth between fiddling around with apps on my phone and watching the door. I wanted to make sure the guys at the race track didn’t know where I lived. I think my brain was trying to protect me from the trauma of all of this by having me suddenly become exhausted from the anxiety and shut down. I quickly fell asleep.

The nightmare I had was surreal to say the least. I was in a pitch-black room. Or black space. It didn’t feel exactly like a room. I was able to stand on a solid floor or ground, but it still felt like endless darkness. No actual floor, walls, or ceiling. About twenty feet in front of me stood the old woman who had given me the money, who I had seen three times now, including this nightmare. She just stared at me. She stared at me with those bizarre turquoise eyes. It felt like an eternity but it must have been only five seconds.

She extended her cupped hand to reveal a small, black kitten. It must have been only a few days old. It was squealing like newborn kittens do, wanting its mother or to be fed. I hesitated for a moment, but the squealing wouldn’t stop. I didn’t know why the old woman wasn’t doing anything about it. She just held the kitten forward, wanting me to take it. A nurturing part of myself took over, so I extended my cupped hand. Without either the old woman or I moving from our places, the black kitten appeared in my hand.

Still squealing, I held it close. “Shhhh, it’s okay” I said to it. I held it close to my chest and began to gently pet it with my other hand. The kitten gradually became quiet and started purring. I looked back up at the old woman. She was still just staring at me.

After a moment, the kitten went silent. It must have fallen asleep. Then, it happened. The fire. My hands began to burn. The kitten had self-combusted. It started screaming a vocalization of pain I had never heard before. A scream I couldn’t recognize as a human or non-human animal. It was warped. It sounded like more than one living thing screaming in utter pain. I dropped the kitten and it hit the floor. I felt horrible for dropping it, but my hands were literally burning from it. It continued to scream. I looked up again at the old woman, she was now smiling. Grinning.

The kitten became silent once again, and the fire burned out. Its charred body sat there lifeless, smoldering. Once again, I looked up, and the old woman’s face now appeared maybe an inch in front of mine. This woke me. I jolted up in my bed in a sweat. The nightmare had felt so real. So unnerving. It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

I took a moment to gather myself before getting out of bed with some deep breathing. I showered and then made some coffee. I sat at my kitchen table still collecting myself. I decided I needed to get out and move around. Maybe get some more coffee across the street to get my dopamine levels high. I walked over to my window to see if the coffee shop was busy or not. I froze. In front of the coffee shop, a man was talking with the same old woman. The feeling that had overtaken me previously before was now panic. The old woman reached into her purse and began to hand the man money. I needed to intervene.

I opened the window and began to yell. “Hey. Hey man. Don’t do it. Don’t talk with her. She’s not ok. She’s trying to trick you. Walk away.” The man looked up at me alarmed and confused. The old woman looked up at me with a subtle yet intense anger. I continued. “It’s not safe. Don’t do it. Go away. Now.”

The man looked away from me and started to walk backward for a moment, looking at the old woman just as startled as he was looking at me. Then he turned around and speed-walked away. The old woman now turned fully facing my direction, holding the same, angry look. She just stood there, staring at me. I quickly closed the window. As I looked back down in front of the coffee shop, the old woman had disappeared. As I turned around, I saw something on the kitchen table where I had been sitting. I walked over to the table. It was a wrinkled $1 bill with multiple brown, splotchy stains all over it.

I’m not religious. I’m not spiritual. I don’t know if I would consider myself agnostic, or even atheist. I do however believe, as many would agree, that there are some things that simply can’t be explained by (though legitimate) scientific processes. It was clear that something was deeply wrong here. I could continue to let things spiral, or I can try and stop this now while I have control over my own life. Control over the parts of my life I haven’t given up on my own.

I decided to burn it. The easiest way to destroy it. I grabbed a lighter out of a drawer in the kitchen, lit the dollar bill on fire, and tossed it into the metal basin of my kitchen sink. It burned, and then, nothing. Nothing in particular happened besides the dollar turning to ash. I looked around my apartment. Nothing. I saw nothing change, and I felt nothing change. I washed the ashes down the drain.

Three knocks were made on my door. I grabbed a kitchen knife nearest to me. I looked through the peephole, no one was standing there. Were they waiting for me around the corner? I decided the best bet was, even if it left me vulnerable, to open my door wide, wait a moment to see if anyone lunges expecting me to walk out, and then run out with my knife. One, two, three. I opened the door. Nothing. I rushed out with the knife and frantically looked back and forth toward both sides of the hallway. No one.

I looked down and saw a square envelope on the ground. I bent down and picked up the envelope. The front was blank. I went back into my apartment and quickly locked the door. I opened the envelope and pulled out what seemed to be a page torn out of a small notebook. It read: “She got me too - 137 \[redacted\] St.”

Truly, reading that, I felt less alone. Though the overall situation was still messed up, if this person was being honest, they were also going through something the old woman had done to them. If it was a trap, then I shouldn’t go to the address at all, right? Especially not right now, when they are expecting me. However, I knew I couldn’t wait for things to get worse. My reality was being distorted. I needed to act while I could. I grabbed my keys, put my jacket on, and put the knife in the inner pocket.

I pulled up to the address parking across the street. It was a fairly plain one-floor home. Light beige-painted brick with some grey siding. White garage doors. Some bushes near the front windows seemed only partially trimmed. One cheap rainbow pinwheel was in the dirt where the bushes were planted, blowing in the breeze. I walked up the short, worn asphalt driveway to the front door. 

Before knocking, I tried to see into the windows from where I was standing, but it was too dark inside. I knocked, three times. No one answered. I knocked again. No one answered. I stood there for a moment, thinking what to do next. I put my ear up to the door to see if I could hear anyone inside, doing anything at all. It was silent. I tried the doorknob. As though it was well-oiled, the turn of the knob made its clicking sound and the door slid slightly open.

I carefully took a few steps inside. “Hello?” I called out. No one responded. There was a hallway in front of me lined with family photos on each side. From where I stood I couldn’t make out the faces in the pictures. The hallway led to what I partially could see as a vinyl-floored kitchen with old wooden cabinets. To my left was a hallway with dark green carpeting that I’m assuming led to bedrooms. To my right was an entranceway to a room that bent around the left corner. I would try there first.

I slowly walked in. When I could fully see the room, I stopped and took it in. The room smelled of cigarettes. To my right, there was an old behemoth of a TV maybe from the 1990’s that was turned off, sitting on a wooden table that had a doily tablecloth draped over it. To my left was an armchair with a TV stand next to it with a remote sitting on top. I couldn’t make out the armchair color. Dark olive green? Off-brown? Laying on the ground in front of the armchair, sprawled out, was the old lady.

The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. Where the blood didn’t create a shade of crimson, the carpet matched the light beige of the outside of the house. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit the old woman’s throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids, and others I assume were in the photos in the entrance hallway, won’t be too happy about this; but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

I heard something, what sounded like a wooden door from the direction of the bedrooms hallway closed. I began to hear light footsteps on the carpet. I bolted out of there, out the front door which I left open, to my car, and sped down the road not looking back.

Two weeks had gone by. I read online from a local news outlet that the police found the scene at the old woman’s house and that the investigation is ongoing. In any other circumstance, I would have reported it to the authorities, especially as I didn’t want to be framed for something I didn’t do. But, this was not a murder. This was someone who put an end to a malevolent force. How would I be able to explain any part of what I went through to the police anyway? I would not only be charged with murder but most likely thrown in a psychiatric ward for an even longer time than I would have serving time in a regular prison. I thought if the police were to arrest me, so be it. 

Till then, I was a free man. Free of what the old woman was doing and was planning to do to me. Going forward, I told myself I would not do the right thing. I would not return dropped money. I would not take it either. Dropped money, helping an elderly person cross the street, it’s simply not happening. I’m not going to be the good guy or the bad guy.

I started going to recovery meetings to address my gambling addiction, and I already noticed my life starting to improve. For once in my life I started to be more confident in myself and my abilities. I even applied for a job that not only paid more but aligned with my passions and interests. I got an offer and I let them know I could start the following week. 

I woke up on a Sunday feeling refreshed. I got up and made some coffee and sat near the window to watch people pass by. The wind was making the trees sway, and the leaves rushed down the sidewalk. The coffee shop across the street was moderately busy with people lining up inside to escape the cold and warm their hands with a mug of the shop’s fresh brew. I finished my cup of coffee and went over to put it in the sink. When I placed my cup in, I saw something crumbled up sitting in the drain. I used my index and middle fingers and successfully pulled it out. 

Once it was in my hand, I unfolded what appeared to be a piece of paper, which I then discovered to be a $1 bill.",1,1767105081.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pzjj2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pzjj2g/aitah_for_being_anal_about_my_celiacs_disease/,AITAH for being anal about my celiacs disease?,"Hi reddit, I (20F) got diagnosed with celiacs disease around end of September time. Funnily enough i was also starting university the same time. 

After I got diagnosed and started telling people, I faced a lot of questions, one example is my dad. He’s a bit of a conspiracy nut and hasn’t seen a doctor in years (ironically i think my celiacs is genetically from him lol) and he’s forever calling me “picky”, saying that this is something i’ve just “decided” as if it’s a choice, and I hear a lot of assumptions about celiac people also. So i already have this era of anxiety when discussing my gluten freeness. 

To get to the point, I’ve been living in shared accommodation with 4 other girls and i’ve not got a bad word to say about their personalities or anything like that  
…but…. the….. hygiene ……..
Now, i am well aware that students are not the cleanest individuals on earth, and that there are so many people out there with much worse, genuinely disgusting flatmates. Mine aren’t so bad- unless you have coeliacs disease. 

Here’s some examples which are leading to imminent crash out:
-I made a GLUTEN FREE pasta bake which was on the side ready to be plated up, i explained to my flatmate who was making toast at the time that i was just letting the pasta sauce thicken a little bit before dishing. So, she picks up her toast out of the toaster and starts walking around the kitchen eating it, over my pasta. This may sound minor, but it killed me off for about 4 days. My pasta must’ve gotten cross contaminated and then I missed a week of lectures dying on the loo and in bed.

-once caught a flatmate cooking an egg in the kettle (has nothing to do with me being gluten free but it was pretty funny and she ruined the kettle for everyone cause who wants eggy coffee in the morning)

-i’ve had food stolen straight out of my cupboard (gluten free beans and sausages might i add… which are quite hard to find !!) 
-bins constantly overflowing i was the only person to change them for the first 4 weeks- as well as being the only person to mop the floors 

-whenever i go to cook i need to wipe down all the countertops because they’re always covered in crumbs (this is a difficult feat in between lectures cause wdym i’ve got an hour to clean, cook, eat then clean again?)

-we share fridges and freezers and the last time i looked in my freezer drawer there was two rolls of bread just sitting there naked on top of all of my freezer food (this seems like a personal attack atp)

-they make noise at all hours after contaminating my food and giving me a flare up (my flare ups make me really knackered and really irritable) so a lot of the time i can’t even sleep through a flare up because all i can hear is my flatmate talking at full volume on the phone at all hours.

There’s probably a few other things that have slipped my mind but there we go. So my issue is the blatant lack of respect for me, because if i had something short term fatal like a nut allergy and they were leaving nuts everywhere I would probably have more of a leg to stand on and i feel as if they would respect that more. I’ve tried time and time again talking to these girls nicely and explaining about my illness, i’ve tried ranting in their faces and nothing has changed and i don’t believe it will second semester. 

We are on Christmas break at the minute, and i’ve been kind of stressed that i’ve been too harsh or too expectant. Like these girls don’t know me and i’ve walked in lording over them about bread, so i can understand why it would be annoying to have a flatmate like me also. So i just wanted some outside perspective, am i the asshole for being too obsessive about my strict diet or are they the assholes for not respecting the fact i don’t want to get bowel cancer by 30? Also, any advice on how to deal with my situation would be incredibly helpful. Thank you for reading !!!!",0,1767104993.0,AITAH,9,0.5,False

However this was abroad and now I’m back in the UK, I went to a local pharmacy and explained the situation. They just gave me a 3 day course of nitrofurantoin and told me to stop taking the ciprofloxacin (I had taken it for 2 days by now). They didn’t do a urine test or anything and just said if the symptoms go away with the nitro then it’s a UTI. Doesn’t not finishing the full course of cipro risk antibiotic resistance, or is it ok because I’m taking nitro instead?

I’m just getting confused and concerned as I don’t understand how I’ve been prescribed antibiotics without anyone actually checking what’s going on. I’ve had 2 UTIs in the past (December 2024 and July 2025), both of which were treated by 3 days of nitro, but I’m concerned if I keep being put on it it will stop working. 

This UTI was also triggered by nothing specific, the first two I’m pretty sure were due to improper hygiene during sexual activity (not peeing after/not washing hands before), but this current one had no clear cause, except potentially dehydration (I wasn’t drinking much water and was drinking more coffee than usual) but is that enough to cause a full UTI? 

I just have so many unanswered questions and am confused about what’s going on with my body, I don’t want to keep getting UTIs forever. I’d like to get a urine culture to see what bacteria is causing this but is it even possible to get these on the NHS in the UK, or would i have to go private? And would I have to wait until my next active UTI to get a culture since this one is being treated with antibiotics? 

I’m just so lost about what to do, I’ve read about d-mannose however that only works for E. coli, so is there any point taking it without a culture to confirm what bacteria I have? Is there anything I can do that works for all UTI causing bacteria? 

Also the pharmacist said it’s fine to drink alcohol in moderation on nitro, is that true? And am I ok to have sex, since that doesn’t seem to be a trigger for me? ",1,1767104613.0,CUTI,5,1.0,False

My Rating System: I use Starbucks as my baseline (0). A score of +5 to -5 indicates how much better or worse the experience was compared to the ""standard"" Starbucks experience.

 * Mocha Latte (Hot) = +4: The foam was thick and rich. You can really taste the oils from the beans. Plus, they roast their own coffee on-site, and that smell is incredible!

 * Decor = +3: A cool mix of modern and industrial. Seeing the roaster is a huge plus. My only minor gripe is the lighting—it’s a very bright white; I’d prefer a warmer tone, but that’s just personal preference.

 * Volume = +1: It clocked in at about 60 dB on my app. It was quiet and peaceful with only a few people in.

 * Staff = +2: Very friendly and cleanly dressed in aprons. I liked that the uniform still allowed for personal style.

 * Food = +2.5: I ordered the cinnamon roll. It tasted like it was freshly baked in-house—extremely good.

 * Workable = +1: Free WiFi is provided. Tables are large enough for a laptop and a notebook, though there aren't many power outlets to plug into.

 * Cleanliness = +1: Everything looked great. No sticky tables, and the bathrooms were well-stocked. I could see a bit of the kitchen and the roasting room; both looked clean and well-maintained.

Notes: They have two unisex bathrooms, a plus in my book, though the water didn’t really get hot.

Price: $7.00 for the coffee. Cinnamon roll $6.5

Overall Rating: +2.07
This means, in my opinion, it is 2.07 times better than Starbucks.

I’m still refining this rating system, so I’d love your suggestions! I feel like using Starbucks as the baseline works because everyone knows what to expect there.

If you have any suggestions please let me know! I think picking on Starbucks as the base line is smart as everyone knows what to expect at Starbucks no matter of the location. When you go to a coffee shop, what are some of the things you want/look for.",18,1767104538.0,frisco,9,0.95,False

Jim Faulkner would always associate the last part of the summer of 1984 with the major promise, the one he and the other friends made to remain friends, no matter what life would throw at them.  Everyone would forever remember that house in Lansing, North Carolina.  They would also remember that magical night gathered around that fire pit.  It was a major turning point in their lives, and their friendship.

But it wasn’t the only turning point.  There were many before that.  Even before the eighties.

Just as the eighties were important to Jim and his friends, so were the seventies.  Jim’s circle of friends began that decade.  They spent many times together, through the good times and the bad.  But the good times would outweigh the bad.  As time passed, Jim grew, learned, and had a lot of fun.  So did everyone else.

 

😊

 

That weekend in August of 1984 would be the next to the last weekend of summer vacation from school.  In a few short days, school would start up again.  Mark Cavanaugh would be a junior at Queen Charlotte High School.  Jim Faulkner, Simon Cavanaugh, Todd McClendon, Kurt Barrett, Vince Crabtree and Kendra Braddock would all enter their ninth grade (and their final year) at Radcliffe Junior High.  Malachi Holbrook and Russell Gilmore would be in the eighth grade.  But they wouldn’t be alone.  This year, Tia Mendes, Julie Holbrook (Malachi’s sister) and Alex Cavanaugh (one of Mark and Simon’s two sisters) would enter their first year (seventh grade) at Radcliffe Junior High.  Malachi and Julie’s sister, Ashley Holbrook, would be entering kindergarten at Dilworth Elementary.  Also at Dilworth Elementary would be April Lynn Holbrook, Ariel and Jodi Cattrall, Scout and Paulina Gilmore, Hannah Duncan, Marissa Crabtree (Vince’s sister), and Sydney Cavanaugh (Mark and Simon’s younger sister).   

The last Saturday of the summer vacation was just about as memorable as that previous Saturday evening.  Autumn Cavanaugh and her kids threw a cookout, and they invited the whole neighborhood.  Autumn grilled out burgers and hot dogs.  Luke Holbrook wanted to grill out steaks.  That was when Jim, at the age of fifteen, would be introduced to steak.  Jim put Heinz 57 Sauce on his steak.  He always would.  Jim always knew it was nice to try new things.  *You are never too young or too old to try new things*.  Jim always tried new things every time he could.  He always would.

Wendy Faulkner, Jim’s mother, still worked at Charlotte Produce Company.  She would work there for a few more years.  Wendy was also taking courses at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte.  Wendy and Jim remained close.  Wendy made salad for the cookout.  She remained friends with the grown-ups.  All the grown-ups also remained friends with the kids as well. 

Reverend Al Quattlebaum, pastor of Salem Church, was also at the cookout, along with his wife, Anna.  After the trip to the mountains, Reverend Q (as he was always known) and his wife had begun talking seriously about starting a family. 

Boyfriends and girlfriends were still together.  Julie Holbrook and Todd McClendon were still an item.  So were Mark Cavanaugh and Kendra Braddock.  Mark’s brother Simon was still Ariel Cattrall’s boyfriend.  Kurt Barrett had Hannah Duncan for his girlfriend.

And of course, there was the “happy couple” known as Jim Faulkner and Candi Robertson.  During the trip to Lansing with the church’s youth ensemble (where that special promise was made), Jim and Candi made the decision to become a steady couple.  They had begun hoping to make it to marriage.  Jim and Candi had already begun having dreams about marrying each other.  They even began planning names for their children!  Come fall, Candi would begin college.  She would start out at Queens College.  At the time, Queens College (on Selwyn Avenue and a short distance from the neighborhood) was an all-female college and would be for three more years.  This fall, Candi would take two courses at Queens College.  One would be in math, and the other would be in English.  Other courses would come later.  Candi hoped she could transfer to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where she would be able to take nursing courses.  Candi had hopes to become a nurse.

Candi was also at the cookout.  Candi stayed by Jim’s side nearly the whole time.  She was wearing a dress.  Candi always wore a dress or a skirt and always would.  It just seemed to be her style.  Another woman in the neighborhood who was like that was Autumn Cavanaugh.  Autumn even wore a skirt with the uniform she was wearing at work as a dental assistant. 

Meanwhile, Candi made an announcement at dinner.  She made the special announcement not only for the benefit of her friends, but also for the benefit of her aunt Trisha and her great aunt Cecilia.  She proudly announced that she and Jim made the decision to be a steady couple.  Jim and Candi also said they hoped to stay together, get married, and have a family together.

Candi still lived with her aunt and her great aunt.  Shortly after Candi and Trisha got home from the trip to the mountains, Cecilia became rather sick.  Trisha ended up caring for her.

Candi ate beside Jim at the picnic table.  Jim ate a steak while Candi ate two hot dogs.  As always, Jim and Candi looked cute together. 

Since they met each other, Jim and Candi were not afraid to let everyone know they belonged to one another.  They were not afraid to hold hands in public places.  If that bothered them, they would never show it.

 

😊

 

Summer vacation was over and it was now time to go back to school.  After school each day (unless it was Tuesday or Thursday since he was working at Gilmore Auto Sales), Jim spent some time at the nearby public library, as did his friends.  Being at the library gave Jim an opportunity to do some homework or do some research on a school project he was assigned.  If he had no homework and if his schoolwork was caught up, Jim would read a magazine or a copy of *The Charlotte Observer* or even *The New York Times*.  At Radcliffe Junior High, Jim had one study period, which he used in the school’s library to study or do some homework, especially if he had to go to work after school.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays after school, Jim worked at Gilmore Auto Sales until six o’ clock, when the place closed.  Jim also worked there on some Saturdays.  Pam Gilmore continued to run the place.  Paulina Gilmore, her daughter, continued to work there.  Paulina was now in the fourth grade at Dilworth Elementary School.  Pam’s sons, Russell and Scout, pretty much kept their own agenda.  Jim washed cars on some days.  Sometimes, he helped Pam sell a car.  There were also times when Jim would help Pam with the paperwork.  But when Jim helped Pam sell a car and when he watched it leave the lot, it made him proud.  Pam felt Jim could be good for business. 

Salem Church also seemed to be doing well.  Reverend Al Quattlebaum (known to everyone as Reverend Q) still ran the show, along with his lovely wife Anna.  That fall, Reverend Q would take on a major project.  He would be fixing up an old Volkswagen Bus.  There was a small garage behind the church.  It was falling apart.  Reverend Q felt it was best to have it torn down, giving the church some more space.  But before he could get started, he saw that old Volkswagen Bus.  Reverend Q was not sure if the bus belonged to the church.  Pam did clear that up.  She said the bus once belonged to the man who preached the church before Reverend Mann, who Reverend Q replaced after he retired.  Reverend Mann just left the van there.  He never came back to reclaim it.  And there was a reason.  Pam tried to get a hold of Reverend Mann after Reverend Q discovered the van.  She was not successful.  One of Reverend Mann’s relatives told her he was in very bad shape and was now in hospice care.  It was also understood Reverend Mann did not have a lot of time left.  Reverend Mann left the Volkswagen Bus in the care of the church, and he told the church to do whatever they could with it.  During that school year, Reverend Q would spend a considerable amount of time fixing up that old bus.  Pam told Reverend Q that if he could fix up the bus, he could have it.  After Reverend Q fixed up the bus, he planned to sell it and donate the money to the church.

That Volkswagen Bus was not the only thing in that old garage.  Shortly after school started, almost everyone in the neighborhood (including Jim and his friends) were invited to help clean out the garage before it got torn down.  Anna was in charge of the whole thing.  She allowed the kids and grown-ups to keep whatever they wanted.  She also allowed the grown-ups to keep anything they wanted.  There were toys, books and magazines of all kinds, a vacuum cleaner, and even some small kitchen appliances.  And no one fought over *anything*!

The kids found a lot.  Jim found two toy trucks made by Nylint.  One was an ABC Sports Truck.  The other was a GMC Truck with a car carrier trailer which carried a Firebird and a Corvette.  Jim got those for Christmas in 1979, when they were released.  He lost them about a year later, and he always wondered what happened to them since he liked them so much.  Mark announced that Reverend Mann had liked the trucks also and had searched high and low for them before he left.  Mark also got those trucks for Christmas in 1979.  Mark still had the trucks at his house, so Jim was allowed to keep both of those trucks.

There were toys galore.  They belonged to the church’s nursery, and even the daycare center that once sat on the church property.  The day care was there when the church was known as Bethany Church.  It stayed open for about two years, only to close due to a lack of business.  Now, the building that housed the day care center was now the church’s family life center, which also did duty as the fellowship hall.

Among the toys that were in the garage were those two trucks Jim was allowed to keep.  There were also some toys associated with the movie *Star Wars*.  There was also a toy version of Noah’s Ark (complete with animals and figures), a toy nativity scene (once again with figures), countless die-cast metal cars (mostly Hot Wheels and Matchbox, and Jim got a few of those, along with Mark, Simon, Russell, Scout, Vince, Todd and Malachi), and there also Tonka toys (a dump truck and a Winnebago).  For the girls, there were numerous Barbie Dolls, and some cars for those dolls. 

There were also some small appliances.  There was a Mr. Coffee (which ended up going to Autumn), an electric skillet, a can opener, and two toasters.  Everyone thought those items got burned up when the church caught fire back in 1980. 

And of course, Reverend Q ended up getting the Volkswagen Bus.  As soon as he got it home, he began working on it, overhauling the engine and transmission, and he also restored the interior.  And he even told everyone about the progress of that project at church services.  He also announced his plans to sell the bus and donate the money to the church.

Reverend Q did sell the bus to a couple who lived on the south side of Charlotte.  The money he got from the bus was donated to the church, as he planned.

 

😊

 

That school year also saw new church members.  And for Jim and his friends, new friends around their ages.

The family’s name was Marlowe.  A mother and father and five kids.  They were the new family in the neighborhood.  They would occupy a vacant house at the end of Bethany Street.  They moved to Charlotte from Johnson City, Tennessee.

The parents proved to be quite interesting.  Peter Marlowe was the father.  He was in his early forties, had a nice light brown crew cut, stood a perfect six feet tall, and he had about an average build.  In Johnson City, Peter worked for a car dealership specializing in exotic sports cars like Ferrari, Porsche and Lamborghini.  When Jim met Peter for the first time, Peter had told that story, and Jim found that quite interesting.  And like Jim (and his friends), Peter had a major love for cars.  It seemed Peter would fit right in.

The name of the mother was Cheryl Marlowe.  She was a little younger than some of the mothers in the neighborhood.  When Jim met Cheryl, he figured her age to be around thirty-three.  He would be right.  Cheryl had blonde hair and brown eyes, had a nice build, and was quite petite, standing around five-foot-two.  Cheryl was a hair stylist in Johnson City.  Wendy said she could help her find a job at a salon in Charlotte, since she knew quite a few hair stylists in the area.

And, just like the other grown-ups in the neighborhood, Peter and Cheryl wanted to be on a first name-basis.  Everyone was proud to oblige to that request.  One day, Cheryl visited Gilmore Auto Sales on a day when Jim was working.  He found out something interesting.  Cheryl was Pam’s sister!  Jim couldn’t believe it!

And of course, there were the kids.  Five of them.

Jonathan Marlowe was the oldest of the kids.  He was about Malachi’s age.  Jonathan was an honor student at his old school in Johnson City.  He also liked cars. He helped his father at his dealership from time to time.  And like Jim, Jonathan wanted to work at a car dealership.  Jonathan had a good, friendly attitude.  He was already willing and eager to make new friends in school and in the neighborhood.

Next in line was Zoe Marlowe.  She was three years younger than Jonathan.  Zoe had brunette hair and brown eyes.  It didn’t take Zoe long to develop a crush on the boys in the neighborhood, even Jim, Kurt, Mark and Simon.  Zoe found out about the fact that they had girlfriends in a hurry.  Zoe announced one day that she played guitar very well.  Reverend Q told Zoe she could play her guitar in church if she would like.  Zoe was only too happy to accept.  Zoe also had a very friendly attitude.

Next in line was a girl by the name of Allison Marlowe.  Allison was a year younger than Zoe.  Allison had wavy blonde hair.  Allison was very good at playing the piano and the organ. 

In the last year, Peter and Cheryl Marlowe became parents to their youngest children.  Twins.  A boy and a girl.  Jonah and Catalina were almost a year old.  Catalina was known as “Cat” for short.

It did not take Jim and his friends long to like the Marlowe bunch.  Jim and his friends became instant friends with the Marlowe kids.  It seemed like they all had a lot in common.  They would all benefit from the friendship.

 

😊

 

One evening in October of 1984, the Marlowe family and the residents of the neighborhood had an opportunity to get better acquainted.  This took place at the Cavanaugh house.  Zoe and Allison wore skirts.  It was revealed to everyone that Peter and Cheryl had a rather strict rule for their daughters.  *You are girls, and you must dress like girls, except for gym class at school*.  Zoe and Allison did wear slacks on some occasions.  Peter and Cheryl did one rule for the boys.  *You boys should dress nice because it could do you a world of good*.  Those rules would eventually carry over to the twins, Jonah and Catalina.  Despite their rules, Peter and Cheryl seemed like friendly people and were only too happy to accept everyone in the neighborhood as friends.

The Marlowe kids’ tastes were up to them.  Jim and his friends found that out when they met in Mark’s room.  Mark’s stereo was playing Steely Dan.  *Do It Again*.  It did not take Zoe and Allison long to develop a crush on the boys.  Just like Zoe, it did not take long for Allison to figure out who had girlfriends. 

Jonathan, Zoe and Allison looked around the room.  Jonathan noticed Mark’s collection of toy and model cars.  He said, “Mark, I see you like cars as much as I do.”

Mark said, “I certainly do.  I guess if anyone doesn’t like cars, it makes for a sorry world.”

Then Jim said, “Jonathan, I’ll have you know I like cars also.  I hope to work in a car dealership when I get older.”     

Jonathan said, “Cool, Jim.  So do I.  Maybe we could work together someday.

Jim said, “I hope so, Jonathan.  Maybe that would be cool.”

Then Mark said, “Jonathan, I hope you can.  If we could work together, we could be a really good team.”

“Mark, I’d like to think so,” Jim said.

Then Allison asked, “Jim, have you and Candi been together long?”

Jim answered, “About a year and a half.”

Then Allison asked, “Mark, how about you and Kendra?  How long have you been together?”

Mark looked at Kendra for an easy answer.  Then Kendra answered, “We’ve been together about nine years now.”

Then Zoe asked, “Anyone else in this room got a boyfriend or a girlfriend?”

Simon was the first to answer that question.  “I do, and she’s sitting beside me.  Ariel Cattrall.  We’ve been together about a year or two.”

Julie was next.  “I am girlfriend to Todd McClendon.”

Next was Kurt.  “Hannah and I have been together for about a year.”

Jonathan asked, “Vince, do you have a girlfriend?”

Vince answered, “No, but I hope to have one someday.”

Allison asked, “How about you, Marissa?  Do you have a boyfriend?”

Marissa answered, “No, I don’t.  But I hope to one sometime down the road.”

Zoe said, “I did have a boyfriend back in Johnson City.  We were together for about a year.  He found someone else.”

Then Allison said, “I had one for about four or five months.”

Then Jim asked, “How about you, Jonathan?  Have you ever had a girlfriend?”

Jonathan answered, “I had a few.  They didn’t last long.”

Mark’s room was quite big.  And on this cool fall evening, it had to be to accommodate the friends who were in the room.  Of course, there was Mark Cavanaugh and his sisters, Alex and Sydney.  There was also Mark’s younger brother, Simon.  There were the Holbrook kids.  There was Malachi.  And there were his sisters, named Julie, April Lynn, Ashley.  The Gilmore kids were also there.  Russell and Scout and their sister Paulina.  There was also Ariel and Jodi Cattrall.  Kurt Barrett was there, along with his girlfriend, Hannah Duncan.  Toni Holbrook and Jeremy Barrett were in the living room with their parents.  Vince and Marissa Crabtree were there, but their mother, Nikki, was not there.  And there was also Kendra Braddock, Todd McClendon and Candi Robertson.  And of course, Jim Faulkner.  And now, there were the Marlowe kids, or at least three of them.  Jonathan and his sisters Zoe and Allison, and they were new in the neighborhood.  Jonah and Cat were downstairs with their parents.

Jim had a question for one of the Marlowe girls.  “Zoe, I understand you can play the guitar.”

Zoe said, “Yes, I can.”

Jim said, “Cool.  I play guitar also.  I play guitar in church from time to time.”

Candi added, “And believe me when I say he’s good.”

Then Sydney said, “Our Mom plays guitar also.  Sometimes, she plays it in church, and sometimes with Jim.”

Then Allison said, “I play piano and organ.”

April Lynn said, “I play piano pretty good.”

Allison said, “April Lynn, that’s good.”

Then April Lynn said, “I hope to be able to play the organ someday.”

Allison said, “April Lynn, if you can play the piano, you can play the organ.”

April Lynn seemed to agree with what Allison said.  A few weeks ago in church, April Lynn did have an opportunity to play the piano.  She did well, and everyone in church agreed. 

The Marlowe kids got a look at Jim looking out the window at the Charlotte skyline, which was lit up.  Zoe said, “Jim, you must like to look out the window at those skyscrapers.”

Jim said, “Yes, Zoe.  I do.  Charlotte does look beautiful at night.  And you all get used to it.  Seeing the skyline at night is beautiful, and something to behold.”

Allison walked to the window and got a look at the skyline.  She agreed that it was beautiful.  She said, “Boy, we sure didn’t see anything like this in Johnson City.”

Jim said, “I’ve never been to Johnson City.”

Jonathan said, “There’s really not much in Johnson City.  We mostly hung out at supermarkets and fast-food places.  But that’s about it.”

Zoe added, “I got a feeling Charlotte is a big place.”

“It is, Zoe.  I know you all will like it here in Charlotte,” Jim said.

At that moment, another friend showed up.  Tia Mendes, the cute girl from Brazil.  Now the whole bunch was together!  Tia looked very pretty.  She was wearing a pink dress with what looked like a big white ribbon around the waist.  From the look on her beautiful face, she seemed to be in good spirits tonight. 

Jonathan, Allison and Zoe introduced themselves to Tia.  Right away, they became good friends.  The other boys in the room told Jonathan that girls from Brazil seemed to be pretty and sweet.  Jonathan agreed.  Tia told the Marlowe kids about her years in Brazil, about how she lost her grandparents and her father, and about her mother and her two younger sisters.  Tia also told everyone that her mother was at her house, caring for her two sisters. 

Food was about to be served.  Autumn called the kids downstairs.  There was a good bit of food being served, mostly finger sandwiches and potato chips and fried chicken and iced tea and sodas, and even a vegetable tray and meat and cheese tray from the deli of a nearby Winn-Dixie.  There was also a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. 

But before the kids could leave the room and make their way downstairs, Jim said, “Hey, you all.  Stop where you are.  We have unfinished business to tend to.”

“Jim, what are you talking about?” Ashley asked.

But it was April Lynn who answered that question.  “Ashley, you know *exactly* what we’re talking about.  A promise.”

“A promise?” Allison asked.

Julie answered, “You’ll find out.”

Everyone in the room gathered around.  Jim began to describe that promise he and his friends made a couple months ago.  “Back in August, we made a special promise.  Everyone in this room made that promise.  And now, those who hadn’t joined in this special promise are about to.”

Jim stuck his head out the door.  Autumn and Wendy were in the hallway.  Jim said to them, “Ladies, we’ll be down shortly.  We have something we need to do.”

Wendy said, “Oh, I see.  I guess you all better take care of it.”

Jim returned to the room.  He got everyone together, and he said, “That evening in August, we sat around a fire pit and made this special promise.”

Everyone got around in a circle.  Jim said this *exactly* as he said it that Saturday evening in the backyard of that house in Lansing.  Jim said, “Let’s all make a promise to remain friends forever, no matter what life may throw at us.”

Everyone looked at Jim, and each other.  And that included those who were there at that house in Lansing just three months earlier.  Right then, some of the grown-ups stuck their heads in the room.  They smiled as the kids said altogether (including Jonathan, Zoe and Allison), “We promise to be friends forever!”

What the kids didn’t know was this.  That August, the grown-ups (those who were at that house in Lansing) made a similar promise.  The kids were very pleased!

 

😊

 

Everyone met downstairs.  Reverend Q and Anna showed up without the kids upstairs knowing it.  Reverend Q said the blessing, and everyone helped themselves to the food.  The grown-ups ate in the dining room, and the kids (except for Toni, Jeremy, Jonah and Catalina) ate outside on the front porch.  Even though it was late October, it was a nice evening.  There was a cool breeze, giving just a hint of fall weather.  The trees all over Charlotte were already showing their fall colors.  But it was still nice enough to eat outside.

Allison asked, “What made you all decide to make a promise like that?”

Jim answered, “It’s like this.  We’ve been friends since we were younger.  We’ve been together through good times and bad.  We’ve done things together.  We helped one another when it was needed.  We were there for one another when something bad happened.  We felt we needed to be friends forever, no matter what.  And that’s what led us to make that promise.”

“And believe us, it feels good,” Julie said.

Everyone got a look at the Charlotte skyline.  Allison said, “I have never seen anything that beautiful, or that impressive.”

Jim asked Allison, “Did you have a skyline like that in Johnson City?”

Allison answered, “Not much of one.”

Then Zoe said, “Just a couple big buildings and very little else.”

Then Sydney said, “You just might like it here in Charlotte.”

Jonathan said, “I hope so.  It seems to be a nice place.”

 

😊

 

One thing about those friends, they knew how to make newcomers feel welcome.  When new friendships were established, it made everyone feel good and special. 

And there was this.  As they did with the Marlowe kids, every time a new friend was made (whether it was one person or a group of siblings), they made the decision to include them in the promise to remain friends forever, no matter what.  That way, everyone felt even more special.  That was how it would be. 

And everyone would keep that promise, no matter what.",1,1767104377.0,u_jim21869,0,1.0,False

1pzja4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/bali/comments/1pzja4j/whats_up_with_people_burning_trash_in_uluwatu_are/,What's up with people burning trash in Uluwatu are those like incents like in Ubud but Uluwatu scented?,"Small rant but for real, I don't understand people burning trash, like I litterally saw builders burning a huge bon fire full of trash and chilling around like wtf? It litterally smells toxic unless they no longer have sense of smell from the toxic fumes... 


I think I rather have them throw it in a bush than burn it for real, I drove from Suluban to Kuta and not only fumes and 2 stokes bikes trynna overtake you so you sniff their fumes but burning trash litterally everywhere like locals just burning cardboxes with plastic tapes etc... 

Even with mask I minused probably couple hours of my life, traveling around all south east Asia I think Bali is the worst I experienced the air or lack of O2. I thought Bangkok pollution was bad, I take it back it was mountain fresh air in Bangkok comparing to here.

Idk why people drive cars too in rush hour, like you ok to stay an hour or two in traffic, not only they block many roads and can't fit 2 lanes so everyone behind need to be stuck with them. 

Also idk why so many ""influencers"" or trynna be are here, it's like some status symbol? ""I'm in Bali 🤳"" (sniffing toxic fumes), and some even buy land and build homes here? Like how about buy land and make it into recycling center make something out of trash, idk pay people to bring you trash and you do something for Bali.

Also it looks lawless here like does Bali even have some government or it's just locals? What was 150k Bali fee at airport for? Like simple thing, pay people small money to bring you trash > do something with trash idk electricity, items? Recycle? Like hello wtf ✋🤚like jail people for burning trash? 1mil fine? Enforce? Police? Ban 2 stroke bikes? 

There are many good things too, food, coffee, chocolate, Gatorade blue waters like Greece, people are nice, affordable Western food and many more but for me trash and traffic takes away all those good points it's just terrible I can't even imagine what's India like some Delhi or something as this is what I imagine it to be, smell or trash, trash everywhere and traffic.

I’m cognizant that we’re all very unique here, but I’m hoping to get some good ol’ Reddit guidance.

I grew up with dairy (milk and yogurt) never having any issues.

I think I slowed down drinking milk at around 18, and by my mid 20s stopped dairy altogether due to gas and bloating.

I’m 31 now, and I believe I have IBS-D.

My current diet is considerably healthy; sella rice, chicken breast, root vegetables, sourdough, bananas, blueberries, peanut butter, and either almond or oat milk. Coffee in the morning (I don’t think I can handle quitting this lol).

My BMs start with a type 4 in the morning, and multiple type 5 & 6 throughout the day.

Regarding dairy: currently, I find that when I consume a small amount of cheese, cream, or milk - my BMs become consistent; 1 or 2x firm type 3 and 4 in a day. However - the gas and bloating are horrible; both smell and pain :-(.

So - I’m thinking I might be a case of “lacking gut bacteria”. I’m just worried that when I consume dairy, smelly gas = poor health.

But then again, frequent loose BMs do~~es~~ not feel good either.

Shoot. What’s the best way forward?",1,1767104336.0,ibs,0,0.67,False
