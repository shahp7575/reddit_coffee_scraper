1qar6le,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qar6le/about_to_buy_a_profitec_drive_and_mazzer_philos/,About to buy a Profitec Drive and Mazzer Philos (sanity check) [no budget],"Hello - I wanted to do a general check in with this sub regarding my plans to get a new machine/grinder. There is no specific budget, but the items I’m eying up generally fit my criteria, but I could also move up/down a bit in price.

For the last few years I have had a Profitec Go and Niche Zero, but I recently sold both as I’m moving country and shipping costs wouldn’t be worth it. Once I settle in to my new place I want to get a higher end set up and I’ve got my eye on a Profitec Drive and Mazzer Philos.

I like single dosing and tend to go for medium/medium-dark roasts - more traditional espresso and also milk drinks Cortados/flat whites. I will usually stick with a bag of coffee until I finish it (usually 250g bags, but sometimes 500-1000g for tried and tested beans).

On weekdays I usually make at least 2 drinks for my wife and me (more if I work from home) and on weekends average about 4 a day for us.

In terms of grinder, the Mazzer Philos with the 189 burrs (for better body) seems to hit all the boxes I’m looking for - I’ve looked into the mini G too which would be available, but I think I’d miss the single dose aspect and do want the ability to change beans etc. easily.

For the machine - I really love the aesthetic of the black Profitec Drive. I know the Synk II exists and there are arguments for that, but I just like the look of the Drive in black better and the hardware seems broadly the same. I’ve also considered a LM micra and Mini but the Drive seems to hit all the boxes I would want for a lower price point whilst still being a top end machine (and even has some additional features).

Just want to get opinions - please let me know your thoughts and if there is anything I should consider before pulling the trigger! Thanks",1,1768212763.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

This is honestly like a last resort since I don’t want to message them before I get advice on it from you guys. 

But i (24F) have 3 friends that I’ve had since highschool. I’ve recently taken placement for my nursing degree and have been unable to hangout with any of them for a month. I did stay in touch with them by sending them pics here and there and texting the groupchat funny patient stories. 

My placement ended last week and I asked them if they’d want to meet up for a coffee or grab dinner. No reply… 

It feels like a slow breakup and it’s really fustrating me especially since I have no idea what I’ve done wrong. 

I need advice on whether i should confront them? I’ve been confrontational about the lack of replies once and it didn’t seem to work out well for me as they made me seem like I’m going crazy over nothing. 

They’re each really important to me and I want to understand what I did wrong.

1qar5wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1qar5wd/i_called_a_ranger_station_to_get_out_of_the_woods/,I Called a Ranger Station to Get Out of the Woods. Something Answered Me Instead.,"I’m writing this with my right ankle wrapped so tight my toes keep going numb. The urgent care doctor called it a “moderate sprain” like that phrase makes it feel smaller. My left forearm has bruises shaped like fingers, too long to look right. The nurse didn’t say that part out loud, but her eyes did.

I went camping to get away from people. I ended up begging one for directions over a radio, and by the end of the night I wasn’t sure the voice on the other end was a person at all.

I want to be clear about something up front: I wasn’t out there trying to test myself. I’m not a survival guy. I wasn’t hunting for creepy stories. I had a reservation and a map and enough food for one night. I picked a back loop because the main campground was full of headlights, barking dogs, and Bluetooth speakers.

The park brochure called my site “primitive.” That should have been a hint. It meant a fire ring, a flat patch of dirt, and a picnic table with initials carved into it so deep the wood looked chewed.

The evening was normal. That’s the part I keep coming back to, like if I replay it enough times I’ll find the exact moment I made the wrong choice.

I ate a lukewarm meal out of a foil tray. I rinsed my hands with a water bottle. I watched the sun drain out of the trees. A couple times I heard something moving in the brush and I did the usual mental math: squirrel, raccoon, deer. I told myself I’d be up early and out before the day hikers showed.

Around nine, when the air got cold and damp, I realized my headlamp wasn’t in my pack.

I’d left it in the car.

The car was parked at a small pull-off a couple miles back. I remembered the pull-off because there was a brown trail sign with the number on it and one of those map cases bolted to a post. The plastic cover on the map case was cracked and someone had stuffed wet paper inside like they’d tried to light it on fire and failed.

I told myself it was a quick walk. I had my phone light. The trail was straightforward. One main path, then a spur.

Fifteen minutes, in and out.

I took my keys, my phone, and without thinking much about it, the little handheld radio I’d brought “just in case.” It was a cheap black unit with a stubby antenna and a screen that glowed green. I’d bought it years ago and barely used it, but I’d programmed in the park’s “ranger frequency” from something I’d read when planning the trip. It made me feel responsible, like I had a backup plan.

The first part of the walk was fine. My phone light made the trail look like a tunnel, and everything beyond it was just shadow and bark. The air smelled like pine needles and cold soil. My footsteps sounded louder than they should have.

Ten minutes in, I passed a reflective trail marker nailed to a tree. It flashed back at me like an animal eye. I remember thinking, good, I’m still on something official.

Another ten minutes and I still hadn’t hit the pull-off.

No gate. No gravel. No sign.

I slowed down, then stopped.

It wasn’t the dramatic “the forest went silent” thing people say. There were still insects. Wind in the needles. Something small moving deeper in the brush. But the human layer was gone. No distant voices from the campground. No car doors. No far-off engine.

I swung my light down and saw something that made my stomach drop.

My own boot prints, faint in the dust, curving off the trail and back toward where I’d come from. Not a clean loop like a track. A sloppy arc.

I had been walking in a circle without realizing it.

My first instinct was to laugh at myself, because that’s what you do when you’re embarrassed and alone. I took out the paper map and held it up in the beam of my phone. The lines and symbols might as well have been a subway map for a city I’d never visited. Everything around me looked the same. Trees, roots, brush, darkness.

I checked the time. 10:18 p.m.

That was when I remembered the radio.

I turned it on. The screen lit up. Static hissed softly.

I pressed the transmit button.

“Ranger station, this is a camper on the back loop. I’m lost. I’m on Trail Six somewhere, I think. I’m trying to get back to the entrance. Do you copy?”

Static, then a click like someone keying a mic.

A voice came through, flattened by the speaker, calm enough to make my shoulders sag with relief.

“Copy. Stand by.”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding.

“Thank you,” I said. “I parked at a pull-off by a gated service road. Brown sign, map case. I walked out to grab my headlamp and I looped. I can’t find the spur back.”

Another pause. Behind the voice, I could hear a faint background sound like wind hitting a building, or maybe just the radio adding its own texture.

“Describe what you see,” the voice said.

It sounded like a man, middle-aged, the kind of voice you’d expect from someone who’s given directions for a living. Not hurried. Not annoyed. Like he’d rather talk you down than lecture you later.

“Evergreens,” I said. “Packed dirt trail. I’m at a fork. Left looks wider, right looks narrow and drops down.”

“Take the right,” he said.

I stared at the fork. The left side looked like the main trail. The right looked like an animal path that someone had convinced themselves was a trail.

“The right is smaller,” I said. “Are you sure?”

“Yes,” he said, immediate. “Right will put you on the access road.”

That didn’t match what my common sense was screaming, but I had a voice on the radio. A ranger. Someone official. I wanted badly for that to be true.

I turned right.

As I walked, I narrated what I could. A fallen limb. A patch of damp ground. The slope. I kept waiting for the trail to open up onto something recognizable.

The radio clicked again.

“Keep your light low,” the voice said.

“What?”

“Keep it low,” he repeated. “Do not swing it around.”

That made no sense. Every safety pamphlet I’d ever seen said the opposite: make yourself visible. Stay put. Conserve battery. Signal.

I should have stopped right there. I should have turned the radio off and started climbing toward higher ground, or stayed put and waited for morning.

Instead, I did what he said. I pointed the beam at my feet and tried not to move it.

A minute later, he asked, “Do you hear water?”

I stopped and listened.

Nothing I could pick out. Just the normal whispering of trees.

“No.”

“Do you hear anything else?” he asked.

The question was too open. Too curious. It didn’t sound like someone trying to locate me. It sounded like someone checking whether I was alone.

“Just… woods,” I said. “Why?”

Static. Then, softly, “Keep moving.”

My phone battery ticked down. Twenty percent. Eighteen. The cold was chewing through it faster than I expected.

I tried to keep my breathing steady. I kept walking.

That’s when I saw the reflective marker again.

Except it wasn’t on a tree.

It was on the ground.

A small rectangle of reflective tape in the dirt, like it had been torn off and dropped. The soil around it looked scraped, disturbed. Not clear footprints, more like something heavy had been dragged across the trail and then lifted.

I crouched without thinking and touched it with two fingers.

The tape was damp and cold.

The radio clicked.

“Don’t touch that,” the voice said.

I froze mid-crouch.

“How did you…” I started, then swallowed it. He couldn’t see me. He couldn’t.

I stood up slowly, heart thudding.

“Ranger,” I said, “what’s your name?”

A pause long enough for the static to fill my head.

“You don’t need that,” the voice said.

My skin prickled under my shirt.

Behind me, somewhere off the trail, something moved.

Not a squirrel. Not a deer. It was too measured. Too heavy.

Footsteps.

One slow step, then another, like something matching my stop and start.

I turned my head without lifting the light. The beam stayed low, because part of me still clung to the idea that following the instructions kept me safe.

“Ranger,” I said quietly, “there’s something behind me.”

The voice on the radio didn’t sound surprised.

“I know,” it said.

My mouth went dry.

I lifted the light anyway and swung it toward the sound.

The beam caught tree trunks, low brush, a tangle of branches. Nothing obvious.

And the moment my light moved, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there in my own shaky cone of light, listening so hard my ears felt strained.

“Who is this?” I said into the radio, and my voice cracked on the last word.

Static surged, then cut suddenly, cleanly, like someone had switched channels.

Then I heard my own voice come back at me through the speaker.

“Who is this?”

Same cadence. Same crack. Same tiny breath at the end.

It wasn’t a recording quality. It wasn’t muffled like a replay. It was like someone had taken my words and thrown them right back.

I jerked the radio away from my face like it had burned me.

The voice returned, calm again, but different now. Less like a person. More like someone wearing a person’s tone.

“Don’t raise your voice,” it said. “Keep moving.”

My chest tightened. I forced myself to turn and start walking, because standing still felt worse. The trail ahead looked narrower than before. Less maintained. The smell changed, too. A sourness under the pine, like wet fur and old meat.

My phone light flickered.

“Ranger,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “I’m going back to the fork. The left trail is wider.”

The radio clicked so fast it felt like an interruption.

“No,” the voice said, sharp. “Do not go back.”

At the same moment, the sound behind me changed.

It wasn’t footsteps anymore. It was a dry, rapid clicking, like someone trying to speak through a throat that didn’t work right.

I stopped walking. My hands shook. I could feel my pulse in my fingers.

I swung the light again.

This time the beam caught it.

Between two trees, half-hidden, a shape that was too tall to be a deer and too thin to be a bear. It was standing upright, but not like a person stands. Its posture was wrong, weight distributed like it wasn’t used to its own joints.

Its torso was narrow and too long. Its arms hung low, almost to its knees. The head was the worst part, because my brain kept trying to label it and failing. It wasn’t antlers like the stories. It wasn’t a clean skull. It looked like skin pulled tight over something sharp. The top had uneven ridges like bone pushing out from inside.

Two dull reflective points caught my light, not bright like animal eyes, but wet and heavy.

It tilted its head.

Then it took one step toward me.

Not loud. Not charging. Just a single, confident step that erased distance too quickly.

I ran.

I ran because I didn’t have a better idea.

The trail pitched down and twisted. My phone light bounced wildly. My breathing turned into ragged pulls. Behind me, I heard movement through brush that didn’t sound panicked. It sounded like it knew exactly where it was going.

The radio in my fist hissed.

“Don’t run,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound worried. It sounded irritated, like I’d stopped playing the game correctly.

My phone light died in the middle of a step.

One second I had a cone of visibility, the next I was in full dark.

I nearly faceplanted. My arms flailed. My foot caught a root. I stumbled, recovered, and kept moving with only the green glow of the radio screen.

The creature’s clicking breath stayed with me. Sometimes louder, sometimes fainter, like it was pacing me from the side.

I tried to slow down to save my ankle, but the moment I did, the clicking got closer.

I ran again.

The trail dipped hard. My foot hit something slick. I went down on my hands and knees. Pain shot up my right wrist like a spark. My knee slammed a root. I bit my tongue and tasted blood.

I pushed up fast, panicked, and my right ankle rolled on loose needles.

A clean, sharp pain climbed my leg and almost took me down again. I had to catch myself against a tree trunk.

I couldn’t put my full weight on that foot anymore.

Behind me, the clicking stopped.

For one breathless second, I thought maybe it had paused. Maybe it had decided I wasn’t worth it.

Then I felt it behind me. Not in a mystical way. In the way you feel a person standing too close in an elevator. Air pressure. Heat. Presence.

I turned, lifting the radio screen like a useless flashlight.

The green glow caught a piece of its face and shoulder.

Up close it wasn’t just thin. It looked damaged. Skin torn and healed wrong, like something had ripped it and it had closed back up without care. The mouth was pulled too wide, lips stretched tight, teeth crowded and uneven like they’d grown in wrong.

It reached toward me with those long, jointed fingers.

I swung the radio at it as hard as I could. Plastic cracked against something solid. The radio flew out of my hand and skittered into the dark.

The creature didn’t flinch.

It grabbed my left forearm.

The grip wasn’t wet or slimy like horror movies. It was cold and dry, like grabbing a dead branch. The pressure was immediate, crushing. Pain bloomed so fast it turned my vision white.

I screamed.

I yanked back, twisting. It dragged me a step like I weighed nothing. Its fingers tightened and I felt something in my arm give in a way that made me nauseous.

My free hand fumbled in my jacket pocket and found the one thing I’d thrown in there without thinking: a cheap road flare. I’d packed it because it was small and because I’d told myself, “It can’t hurt.”

My fingers shook so badly I almost dropped it.

I popped the cap, scraped the tip, and for half a second nothing happened and I thought I’d just died doing something stupid.

Then it lit.

A violent red flame, hissing, bright enough to turn the trees into hard-edged black silhouettes.

The creature jerked back like the light hit it physically. Its grip loosened. Not a full release, but enough.

I ripped my arm free and stumbled backward, holding the flare out between us like a spear.

In the red light I saw more of it. Legs too long. Knees bending in a way that looked half backwards. Skin mottled like bruises under thin flesh. Dark stains around its mouth that weren’t fresh but weren’t old enough to be nothing.

It didn’t charge.

It watched the flare with the same tilted-head curiosity, clicking softly.

Then it did something that snapped the situation into a new, colder shape.

It looked past the flare.

Down at the ground.

Toward where the radio had slid.

It took a slow step toward it, careful, like it didn’t want to get close to the flare.

Another step.

It wasn’t focused on me. It wanted the radio.

My throat tightened. I backed away, flare held out, and realized the “ranger” voice hadn’t been trying to save me. It had been trying to keep me moving, keep me talking, keep me transmitting.

Like a lure.

Like a line it could follow.

The creature crouched, long limbs folding wrong, and picked up the radio with those stick-like fingers. It turned it over as if it understood what it was holding.

Then the radio clicked.

And from the speaker, not from my hand now but from the thing’s hand, came the voice again.

Calm. Patient.

“Describe what you see.”

The creature lifted its head, still holding the radio, and the dull reflective points of its eyes turned to me.

I felt my stomach drop through the floor.

I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. I turned and limped away as fast as my ankle would let me, flare burning down in my hand, my left arm throbbing and numb where it had grabbed me.

The clicking breath moved with me, not rushing, not fading. Just staying close enough to remind me it could.

The flare shortened quickly, heat biting my palm. Red sparks spat into the dark.

I forced myself to follow the trail because stepping off into the trees felt like stepping off a dock at night. You don’t know what you’ll hit until you do.

Ahead, through the trees, I saw something angular and straight. Not a branch. Not a trunk.

A signpost.

I limped toward it and almost cried when I saw the reflective letters catch the flare light.

TRAIL 6

SERVICE ROAD 0.4

RANGER STATION 1.2

My brain snagged on that last line.

RANGER STATION.

Deeper.

Not out.

The flare hissed lower. The light dimmed.

From off to my right, through the trees, I heard the radio again.

A little burst of static.

A click.

Then my own voice, thin and distant, as if someone had learned the shape of it and was practicing.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I froze.

The sound didn’t come from behind. It came from the side, like it was trying to draw my attention off the trail. Toward the trees. Toward the direction that sign said “RANGER STATION.”

My chest tightened hard enough to hurt.

I turned my face away from the sound and forced my feet to move toward “SERVICE ROAD 0.4.”

Every step on that ankle was a bright spike of pain. My left arm felt heavy and wrong. I could feel bruising spreading under my skin.

The flare died with a wet sputter.

Darkness swallowed everything.

I stood still for a second because my eyes were useless and my panic was loud. Then I heard it again. The clicking breath, closer, patient.

I moved.

I walked by feel, hands out, fingertips catching branches, following the faint line of packed dirt underfoot. I slipped once on loose gravel and almost went down. I caught myself against a tree and felt bark dig into my scraped palm.

The radio crackled in the trees.

Sometimes it was static. Sometimes it was my voice repeating the same few words. Sometimes it was that calm “ranger” voice saying, “You’re almost there.”

After what felt like an hour but was probably ten minutes, the ground changed under my boots.

Gravel.

Then flat, hard-packed gravel.

A road.

I stepped forward and the tree line opened just enough that I could make out a darker shape ahead.

A metal gate.

I stumbled to it and grabbed it with both hands like it was a lifeline. The metal was cold. I pressed my forehead to it and pulled in air that tasted like rust and sap.

Behind me, the radio static swelled.

Close.

I turned slowly.

I couldn’t see it in the dark, but I could hear it. The clicking breath, a soft scrape of something moving through brush just off the road, staying in the cover of trees.

The radio clicked.

“Open the gate,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound like a ranger anymore. It sounded strained, like the words were being forced out through a mouth that didn’t fit them.

“I can’t,” I whispered, because my brain was still treating it like a conversation.

“Open it,” the voice repeated.

And under the words, the clicking breath accelerated, excited.

I backed away from the gate, then stopped, because backing away meant stepping closer to the sound.

I stood in the middle of the service road, gravel under my boots, and tried to think.

Cars used service roads. Rangers used service roads. If I followed it long enough, I’d hit something. A lot. A building. A sign. Anything.

Staying still felt like waiting to be taken.

I chose movement.

I limped down the road, faster than my ankle wanted, gravel crunching underfoot. To my right, in the tree line, something moved with me, quiet and effortless.

Every few seconds, the radio voice tried a new angle.

“Turn back.”

“You’re going the wrong way.”

“Your car is not there.”

Then, softer, using my voice again, like it was trying to sound concerned.

“Hey… hey… where are you?”

I didn’t answer. I bit down on my tongue and kept moving.

The road curved. The trees thinned.

And then, ahead, I saw the faint outline of a vehicle.

My car.

The pull-off.

I almost fell from relief. My hands shook so badly I dropped my keys once, then found them by feel and hit the unlock button.

The beep sounded like the best noise I’ve ever heard.

I got the driver’s door open and folded into the seat, dragging my bad ankle in like it didn’t belong to me. Pain flashed up my leg. I slammed the door and locked it.

For a second, I sat there in the dark, breathing hard, staring straight ahead like that would keep me safe.

Then I looked at my side mirror.

At the edge of the pull-off, where gravel met trees, something stood half-hidden in the brush.

Tall. Too thin. Motionless.

In one hand, a small green glow.

My radio.

It lifted the radio slightly, as if showing it to me.

Then the speaker crackled.

And the voice that came out was mine, careful and patient, exactly the way I’d sounded when I thought help was real.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I turned the key.

The engine coughed, then caught. The dashboard lit up.

The headlights snapped on, bright white, flooding the pull-off.

The brush at the edge of the trees was empty.

No movement. No shape. No glowing radio.

Just branches and shadow.

I didn’t wait. I threw the car into reverse, gravel spraying, and drove like I was late for my own funeral.

I didn’t stop until I hit pavement. I didn’t stop until I saw another vehicle’s taillights. I didn’t stop until I found the park office, a dark building with a big sign and an emergency phone mounted on the wall.

I called.

I told the person on the other end that I was injured, lost, and something had chased me. I didn’t say “wendigo.” I didn’t say “monster.” I said “an animal” because I needed them to send someone and I didn’t want to sound insane.

They told me to stay in my car with the doors locked until a ranger arrived.

A ranger truck rolled in twenty minutes later. Light bar flashing, tires crunching. The ranger was young, maybe late twenties, and he had the exhausted posture of someone who’d already worked a full day and then got pulled into someone else’s mistake.

He walked up to my window and I rolled it down an inch. I didn’t mean to, but the second I saw a uniform my throat tightened and my eyes burned.

He took one look at my hands and my ankle and swore under his breath.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “Okay. Okay. You did the right thing coming here.”

He helped me into his truck. The heater blew air that smelled like coffee and old vinyl. My body started shaking now that the danger was gone enough for my nerves to catch up.

On the drive to the clinic in the nearest town, he asked me what happened.

I told him the clean version first. Lost the trail. Radioed for help. Got turned around. Something grabbed me.

I didn’t talk about the voice using my voice until the words fell out by accident.

“It repeated me,” I said, staring at my bruised arm. “Like… like it was throwing my words back.”

The ranger’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.

“What channel were you on?” he asked.

“Seven,” I said. “The ranger frequency.”

His eyes flicked to me, quick.

“That’s not ranger dispatch,” he said.

My mouth went dry. “Then who answered me?”

He didn’t answer right away. He watched the road ahead like he was reading it.

Finally he said, “Nobody should have.”

The clinic wrapped my ankle, checked my wrist, cleaned the scrapes on my palms. The bruises on my forearm had started to bloom dark purple by then, finger-shaped, too long. The nurse asked if I’d gotten caught in wire.

I nodded because it was easier than explaining I’d been grabbed by something that didn’t move like a person.

When I came out, the ranger was still there. He stood by his truck with his hands in his jacket pockets like he didn’t want to leave me alone to walk to my car.

“Did you find my radio?” I asked, and I hated how small my voice sounded.

He shook his head. “No.”

I swallowed. “Is there… is there an old ranger station out there? Like an actual tower?”

He hesitated, then sighed like he’d made a decision.

“There’s a decommissioned lookout,” he said. “Old structure. Not staffed. We don’t use it.”

“So the voice could’ve been someone messing with me,” I said, trying to find a normal explanation to cling to.

He looked tired, and for a second he looked older than he was.

“It’s possible,” he said. “But listen to me. If you ever camp again, you do not call for help on random channels. You call the emergency number. You stay put. You don’t let a voice tell you to walk deeper. You understand?”

I nodded.

He leaned closer, lowering his voice like the night could hear us.

“And if you hear your own voice come back at you,” he added, “you stop transmitting.”

I stared at him.

“You’ve heard that?” I asked.

He didn’t answer directly. He just said, “Dispatch got weird traffic tonight. On that channel. We thought it was interference at first.”

“What kind of traffic?”

He rubbed his jaw like he didn’t want to say it.

“A man asking for help,” he said finally. “Saying he was lost. Saying he was on Trail Six.”

My stomach dropped.

“That was me,” I whispered.

He shook his head once.

“No,” he said. “It started before you called. And it kept going after you stopped.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Not really. I lay in my apartment with my ankle propped up and my forearm throbbing and I kept hearing that clicking breath in the back of my head, like my brain had recorded it and didn’t know how to delete it.

Two days later, in daylight, I went back to the park office. I told myself I was going to file a report about the radio. I told myself I wanted closure.

The woman behind the counter was older, hair pulled back, eyes sharp in the way people get after years of dealing with strangers who don’t read rules.

I gave her my name and the date. She typed into her computer. Her nails clicked against the keys.

“No lost property matching that,” she said.

I nodded like I expected it.

Then I asked, carefully, “Do you get… strange radio calls? People using the wrong channel?”

Her eyes shifted, just a fraction, to a binder on the desk behind her. A plain three-ring binder with a white label strip.

She didn’t reach for it. She didn’t have to.

“There are signs in the brochure kiosk,” she said, voice neutral. “About emergency procedures.”

“I saw those,” I said. “They don’t mention radio channels.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her tone did. It got flatter.

“We don’t provide radio channels,” she said. “Not anymore.”

“Why?”

She stared at me for a moment like she was deciding how much truth a stranger deserved.

Then she slid a piece of laminated paper across the counter. Not a brochure. Not a map. Something that looked like it had been printed in-house and updated a hundred times.

It had one line in bold at the top:

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

Below that were three bullet points. Short. Clinical.

	•	If you are lost, stay on trail and stay put.

	•	Use emergency phones or call 911 if service is available.

	•	If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

My mouth went dry.

“That’s a weird thing to have to print,” I said.

She didn’t smile.

“It became necessary,” she said.

I tried to speak. My throat felt tight.

“Has anyone… been hurt?” I asked.

She paused long enough that my stomach sank again, then said, “People get found. People don’t get found. Same as any park.”

She reached under the counter and pulled out a small plastic bag.

Inside was a handheld radio. Not mine. Different brand. Same cheap shape. Mud dried into the grooves.

She set it on the counter like evidence.

“We find these sometimes,” she said. “Not often. Usually they’re dead. Sometimes they’re still on.”

I stared at it.

“What do you do when they’re still on?” I asked.

Her eyes met mine.

“We turn them off,” she said. “And we don’t stand there listening.”

I left after that. I didn’t argue. I didn’t ask for the location of the decommissioned lookout. I didn’t ask about the binder. I didn’t want to.

I drove home with both hands tight on the wheel and the irrational feeling that if I relaxed my grip, the car would drift into the trees.

Here’s the last thing I’ll say, because it’s the part I can’t explain away.

Last night, I was cleaning out my pack. Shaking dirt out of the seams. Counting what I’d lost.

I found the flare wrapper in a side pocket and the edge of the paper map, folded wrong from when I’d yanked it out. I found a smear of dried blood on the strap where my wrist scraped it when I fell.

And tucked into the smallest inside pocket, the one I never use, I found a strip of reflective tape.

The same kind that had been on the ground.

Damp. Cold, even though it had been inside my apartment for days.

When I held it up to the light, I saw something stuck to the adhesive.

A single dark hair, coarse and stiff, like it didn’t belong to any animal I know.

I threw the tape away. I took the trash out immediately. I washed my hands until my skin was raw.

And later, lying in bed with my ankle throbbing and my arm bruised and my phone charging on the nightstand, I heard a sound that made my whole body lock up.

A soft burst of static.

A click.

Not from outside. Not from the woods.

From somewhere in my apartment, close enough that I could hear the tiny speaker distortion.

Then, very quietly, my own voice, patient and calm, asking the same question it asked the night I thought help was real.

1qar3yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1qar3yv/your_gut_could_be_fueling_your_anxiety/,Your Gut Could Be Fueling Your Anxiety,"Anxiety can feel like it comes out of nowhere. You’re living your life, managing work, relationships, errands, and then suddenly, your heart races. Your thoughts spiral. Your stomach flips. You can’t sleep, can’t focus, and sometimes you can’t even explain why you’re so overwhelmed.

If you’ve tried therapy, meditation, or even medication, and you still feel like you’re stuck in an anxious loop, it might be time to look somewhere totally unexpected: Your gut.

We’re not just talking about that “gut feeling” you get when something’s off. We’re talking about your digestive health, and how it could be silently running the show when it comes to your mental state.



The Gut-Brain Connection Is Real

Science now confirms what ancient wisdom has long suspected: your brain and your gut are in constant communication. In fact, your gut has its own nervous system. Named the enteric nervous system, it talks to your brain through a pathway known as the gut-brain axis.

 The information doesn’t just flow one way. Your thoughts and emotions influence your digestion, yes, but what’s happening in your gut can directly influence your mood, stress levels, and anxiety.

One of the most fascinating discoveries in recent years is that over 90% of your body’s serotonin (that feel-good, mood-stabilizing chemical) is produced in the gut. That’s not a typo. 90%.

So if your gut is inflamed, imbalanced, or not functioning optimally, it can throw your serotonin levels and your emotional equilibrium into chaos.



How Your Gut Could Be Contributing to Your Anxiety

Let’s say you’ve been dealing with anxiety for years. Maybe it flares up before big events, during your cycle, or out of nowhere when you’re already tired and stretched thin. You may have blamed hormones, stress, lack of sleep, or yourself.

But behind the scenes, your gut may be struggling.

Here’s how:

Dysbiosis (Gut Imbalance): When the balance between good and bad bacteria in your gut is off, it can increase inflammation and disrupt neurotransmitter production fueling anxiety and mood swings.

Leaky Gut: If your gut lining is compromised, tiny particles from food or bacteria can escape into your bloodstream. Your immune system goes into overdrive, creating low-grade inflammation that impacts your brain chemistry.

Blood Sugar Imbalances: A gut that’s out of balance struggles to regulate blood sugar effectively, which can lead to anxiety-inducing crashes, irritability, and foggy thinking.

Poor Nutrient Absorption: Even if you’re eating well, a compromised gut may not absorb the nutrients (like B-vitamins, magnesium, and zinc) that your brain needs to feel calm and grounded.



Anxiety That Starts in the Gut Feels a Little Different

You might notice:

Anxiety that feels physical; a tight chest, shallow breathing, a knot in your stomach.

Random waves of dread, even when life feels “fine.”

Trouble falling or staying asleep.

A sense of agitation that no amount of deep breathing seems to fix.

Digestive issues that flare up around the same time—bloating, cramping, or unpredictable bowels.

If this sounds familiar, it’s a sign that your gut is asking for support.



So What Can You Do to Calm Your Gut and Your Mind?

Anxiety can’t always be “cured” overnight. But when you focus on healing your gut, you create the conditions for a calmer, more resilient nervous system. And that changes everything.

Here’s where to start:

Stop Ignoring Your Digestion

If your stomach feels off, even subtly, it matters. Bloating, constipation, heartburn, or even just sluggishness after meals are all signals that your gut might need help.

Pay attention. Track symptoms. You don’t need to obsess over every bite, but bringing gentle awareness to how you feel after you eat can uncover patterns worth addressing.

Feed Your Good Bacteria

Fermented foods like sauerkraut, kefir, cultured vegetables, and unpasteurized miso are rich in beneficial bacteria that support a balanced gut microbiome. If fermented foods aren’t your thing (yet), consider a high-quality probiotic supplement, especially one that supports mood and gut balance.

Equally important: feed those good bacteria with prebiotic fiber, things like oats, asparagus, onions, and flaxseeds.

Balance Your Blood Sugar

One of the most effective ways to calm anxious energy is to keep your blood sugar stable. Every time your blood sugar spikes and crashes, whether from skipping meals, loading up on sugar, or drinking coffee on an empty stomach, your body releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline.

These hormones can mimic the very symptoms of anxiety: a racing heart, irritability, panic, and fatigue. A few simple shifts can make a big difference. Start your day with a nourishing breakfast that includes protein and healthy fats. Add a little avocado or nut butter to your toast, or pair your fruit with a boiled egg. Avoid sugary snacks that give a quick high followed by a crash, and always aim to eat regularly throughout the day to keep your system steady.

Support Your Nervous System Daily

You don’t need an hour of meditation or a week-long retreat to feel calmer, you just need small, consistent moments of regulation. Supporting your nervous system is less about intensity and more about regularity. A few minutes of deep breathing in the morning can signal safety to your body before the day begins. A short walk after lunch helps reset both digestion and mental clarity. Turning off screens 30 minutes before bed gives your brain a chance to wind down. And perhaps most importantly, learning to say “no” to things that drain your energy creates space for what actually helps you feel grounded. These small rituals add up, and over time, they create a foundation your nervous system can rely on.

Regulating your nervous system is like strengthening a muscle. It gets easier with practice.

Ask for Help

There’s no shame in feeling anxious. And there’s no need to go it alone. A qualified functional nutritionist or holistic practitioner can help you map out your symptoms and create a plan that supports both gut healing and emotional wellness.  Anxiety can feel so personal, like it’s a flaw in your character or something you should be able to push through.

But the truth is, your body may be sending you signals that it needs support, not judgment.

When you begin to understand the link between your gut and your emotions, everything changes. You stop blaming yourself and start listening. You start trusting your body’s wisdom again.

You start to heal.



Ready to feel clear, calm, and connected again? 

If you suspect your anxiety may be rooted in your gut, you're not alone. And you don’t have to navigate it on your own. At The Gut Health Specialists, we take a compassionate, whole-body approach to healing, helping you uncover the root causes of your symptoms and create a personalized plan that truly supports your mind and body.

I use them a lot, they are great PPE and you won't find me on forums discussing how to keep the shape, clean them etc etc. I'm Bush Tucker practicality all the way.

I need a new one and when I went to purchase, I could see two previous times I had bought since June 2022.

What I would like your 2c worth on is the movement in the cost (or investment) over that time.

* I didn't add freight this time - so the total would be $425.

Am I:

* Overreacting to the price increase?
* A complete tight arse?
* Not cool because I am not in the Instagram model direction they are going in?

Self Justification:

* There is no better work hat. Ever.
* Costs more than the ABC per day, but less than a daily coffee at Manly Beach
* Comfortable and durable
* Durable
* Very comfortable
* I like it!

Roofing:

* Makes be look like a roofing screw 🤠

**Conclusion:**

I bought it anyway, because its a great wear. Lots of sun protection, and I have a big nose.

Akubra are a great Aussie brand. I'm happy they are still in business, and making great product with the new owners. I've bought beers at the airport so, I know what robbery feels like, and still buy.

Something Answered Me Instead.,"I’m writing this with my right ankle wrapped so tight my toes keep going numb. The urgent care doctor called it a “moderate sprain” like that phrase makes it feel smaller. My left forearm has bruises shaped like fingers, too long to look right. The nurse didn’t say that part out loud, but her eyes did.

I went camping to get away from people. I ended up begging one for directions over a radio, and by the end of the night I wasn’t sure the voice on the other end was a person at all.

I want to be clear about something up front: I wasn’t out there trying to test myself. I’m not a survival guy. I wasn’t hunting for creepy stories. I had a reservation and a map and enough food for one night. I picked a back loop because the main campground was full of headlights, barking dogs, and Bluetooth speakers.

The park brochure called my site “primitive.” That should have been a hint. It meant a fire ring, a flat patch of dirt, and a picnic table with initials carved into it so deep the wood looked chewed.

The evening was normal. That’s the part I keep coming back to, like if I replay it enough times I’ll find the exact moment I made the wrong choice.

I ate a lukewarm meal out of a foil tray. I rinsed my hands with a water bottle. I watched the sun drain out of the trees. A couple times I heard something moving in the brush and I did the usual mental math: squirrel, raccoon, deer. I told myself I’d be up early and out before the day hikers showed.

Around nine, when the air got cold and damp, I realized my headlamp wasn’t in my pack.

I’d left it in the car.

The car was parked at a small pull-off a couple miles back. I remembered the pull-off because there was a brown trail sign with the number on it and one of those map cases bolted to a post. The plastic cover on the map case was cracked and someone had stuffed wet paper inside like they’d tried to light it on fire and failed.

I told myself it was a quick walk. I had my phone light. The trail was straightforward. One main path, then a spur.

Fifteen minutes, in and out.

I took my keys, my phone, and without thinking much about it, the little handheld radio I’d brought “just in case.” It was a cheap black unit with a stubby antenna and a screen that glowed green. I’d bought it years ago and barely used it, but I’d programmed in the park’s “ranger frequency” from something I’d read when planning the trip. It made me feel responsible, like I had a backup plan.

The first part of the walk was fine. My phone light made the trail look like a tunnel, and everything beyond it was just shadow and bark. The air smelled like pine needles and cold soil. My footsteps sounded louder than they should have.

Ten minutes in, I passed a reflective trail marker nailed to a tree. It flashed back at me like an animal eye. I remember thinking, good, I’m still on something official.

Another ten minutes and I still hadn’t hit the pull-off.

No gate. No gravel. No sign.

I slowed down, then stopped.

It wasn’t the dramatic “the forest went silent” thing people say. There were still insects. Wind in the needles. Something small moving deeper in the brush. But the human layer was gone. No distant voices from the campground. No car doors. No far-off engine.

I swung my light down and saw something that made my stomach drop.

My own boot prints, faint in the dust, curving off the trail and back toward where I’d come from. Not a clean loop like a track. A sloppy arc.

I had been walking in a circle without realizing it.

My first instinct was to laugh at myself, because that’s what you do when you’re embarrassed and alone. I took out the paper map and held it up in the beam of my phone. The lines and symbols might as well have been a subway map for a city I’d never visited. Everything around me looked the same. Trees, roots, brush, darkness.

I checked the time. 10:18 p.m.

That was when I remembered the radio.

I turned it on. The screen lit up. Static hissed softly.

I pressed the transmit button.

“Ranger station, this is a camper on the back loop. I’m lost. I’m on Trail Six somewhere, I think. I’m trying to get back to the entrance. Do you copy?”

Static, then a click like someone keying a mic.

A voice came through, flattened by the speaker, calm enough to make my shoulders sag with relief.

“Copy. Stand by.”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding.

“Thank you,” I said. “I parked at a pull-off by a gated service road. Brown sign, map case. I walked out to grab my headlamp and I looped. I can’t find the spur back.”

Another pause. Behind the voice, I could hear a faint background sound like wind hitting a building, or maybe just the radio adding its own texture.

“Describe what you see,” the voice said.

It sounded like a man, middle-aged, the kind of voice you’d expect from someone who’s given directions for a living. Not hurried. Not annoyed. Like he’d rather talk you down than lecture you later.

“Evergreens,” I said. “Packed dirt trail. I’m at a fork. Left looks wider, right looks narrow and drops down.”

“Take the right,” he said.

I stared at the fork. The left side looked like the main trail. The right looked like an animal path that someone had convinced themselves was a trail.

“The right is smaller,” I said. “Are you sure?”

“Yes,” he said, immediate. “Right will put you on the access road.”

That didn’t match what my common sense was screaming, but I had a voice on the radio. A ranger. Someone official. I wanted badly for that to be true.

I turned right.

As I walked, I narrated what I could. A fallen limb. A patch of damp ground. The slope. I kept waiting for the trail to open up onto something recognizable.

The radio clicked again.

“Keep your light low,” the voice said.

“What?”

“Keep it low,” he repeated. “Do not swing it around.”

That made no sense. Every safety pamphlet I’d ever seen said the opposite: make yourself visible. Stay put. Conserve battery. Signal.

I should have stopped right there. I should have turned the radio off and started climbing toward higher ground, or stayed put and waited for morning.

Instead, I did what he said. I pointed the beam at my feet and tried not to move it.

A minute later, he asked, “Do you hear water?”

I stopped and listened.

Nothing I could pick out. Just the normal whispering of trees.

“No.”

“Do you hear anything else?” he asked.

The question was too open. Too curious. It didn’t sound like someone trying to locate me. It sounded like someone checking whether I was alone.

“Just… woods,” I said. “Why?”

Static. Then, softly, “Keep moving.”

My phone battery ticked down. Twenty percent. Eighteen. The cold was chewing through it faster than I expected.

I tried to keep my breathing steady. I kept walking.

That’s when I saw the reflective marker again.

Except it wasn’t on a tree.

It was on the ground.

A small rectangle of reflective tape in the dirt, like it had been torn off and dropped. The soil around it looked scraped, disturbed. Not clear footprints, more like something heavy had been dragged across the trail and then lifted.

I crouched without thinking and touched it with two fingers.

The tape was damp and cold.

The radio clicked.

“Don’t touch that,” the voice said.

I froze mid-crouch.

“How did you…” I started, then swallowed it. He couldn’t see me. He couldn’t.

I stood up slowly, heart thudding.

“Ranger,” I said, “what’s your name?”

A pause long enough for the static to fill my head.

“You don’t need that,” the voice said.

My skin prickled under my shirt.

Behind me, somewhere off the trail, something moved.

Not a squirrel. Not a deer. It was too measured. Too heavy.

Footsteps.

One slow step, then another, like something matching my stop and start.

I turned my head without lifting the light. The beam stayed low, because part of me still clung to the idea that following the instructions kept me safe.

“Ranger,” I said quietly, “there’s something behind me.”

The voice on the radio didn’t sound surprised.

“I know,” it said.

My mouth went dry.

I lifted the light anyway and swung it toward the sound.

The beam caught tree trunks, low brush, a tangle of branches. Nothing obvious.

And the moment my light moved, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there in my own shaky cone of light, listening so hard my ears felt strained.

“Who is this?” I said into the radio, and my voice cracked on the last word.

Static surged, then cut suddenly, cleanly, like someone had switched channels.

Then I heard my own voice come back at me through the speaker.

“Who is this?”

Same cadence. Same crack. Same tiny breath at the end.

It wasn’t a recording quality. It wasn’t muffled like a replay. It was like someone had taken my words and thrown them right back.

I jerked the radio away from my face like it had burned me.

The voice returned, calm again, but different now. Less like a person. More like someone wearing a person’s tone.

“Don’t raise your voice,” it said. “Keep moving.”

My chest tightened. I forced myself to turn and start walking, because standing still felt worse. The trail ahead looked narrower than before. Less maintained. The smell changed, too. A sourness under the pine, like wet fur and old meat.

My phone light flickered.

“Ranger,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “I’m going back to the fork. The left trail is wider.”

The radio clicked so fast it felt like an interruption.

“No,” the voice said, sharp. “Do not go back.”

At the same moment, the sound behind me changed.

It wasn’t footsteps anymore. It was a dry, rapid clicking, like someone trying to speak through a throat that didn’t work right.

I stopped walking. My hands shook. I could feel my pulse in my fingers.

I swung the light again.

This time the beam caught it.

Between two trees, half-hidden, a shape that was too tall to be a deer and too thin to be a bear. It was standing upright, but not like a person stands. Its posture was wrong, weight distributed like it wasn’t used to its own joints.

Its torso was narrow and too long. Its arms hung low, almost to its knees. The head was the worst part, because my brain kept trying to label it and failing. It wasn’t antlers like the stories. It wasn’t a clean skull. It looked like skin pulled tight over something sharp. The top had uneven ridges like bone pushing out from inside.

Two dull reflective points caught my light, not bright like animal eyes, but wet and heavy.

It tilted its head.

Then it took one step toward me.

Not loud. Not charging. Just a single, confident step that erased distance too quickly.

I ran.

I ran because I didn’t have a better idea.

The trail pitched down and twisted. My phone light bounced wildly. My breathing turned into ragged pulls. Behind me, I heard movement through brush that didn’t sound panicked. It sounded like it knew exactly where it was going.

The radio in my fist hissed.

“Don’t run,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound worried. It sounded irritated, like I’d stopped playing the game correctly.

My phone light died in the middle of a step.

One second I had a cone of visibility, the next I was in full dark.

I nearly faceplanted. My arms flailed. My foot caught a root. I stumbled, recovered, and kept moving with only the green glow of the radio screen.

The creature’s clicking breath stayed with me. Sometimes louder, sometimes fainter, like it was pacing me from the side.

I tried to slow down to save my ankle, but the moment I did, the clicking got closer.

I ran again.

The trail dipped hard. My foot hit something slick. I went down on my hands and knees. Pain shot up my right wrist like a spark. My knee slammed a root. I bit my tongue and tasted blood.

I pushed up fast, panicked, and my right ankle rolled on loose needles.

A clean, sharp pain climbed my leg and almost took me down again. I had to catch myself against a tree trunk.

I couldn’t put my full weight on that foot anymore.

Behind me, the clicking stopped.

For one breathless second, I thought maybe it had paused. Maybe it had decided I wasn’t worth it.

Then I felt it behind me. Not in a mystical way. In the way you feel a person standing too close in an elevator. Air pressure. Heat. Presence.

I turned, lifting the radio screen like a useless flashlight.

The green glow caught a piece of its face and shoulder.

Up close it wasn’t just thin. It looked damaged. Skin torn and healed wrong, like something had ripped it and it had closed back up without care. The mouth was pulled too wide, lips stretched tight, teeth crowded and uneven like they’d grown in wrong.

It reached toward me with those long, jointed fingers.

I swung the radio at it as hard as I could. Plastic cracked against something solid. The radio flew out of my hand and skittered into the dark.

The creature didn’t flinch.

It grabbed my left forearm.

The grip wasn’t wet or slimy like horror movies. It was cold and dry, like grabbing a dead branch. The pressure was immediate, crushing. Pain bloomed so fast it turned my vision white.

I screamed.

I yanked back, twisting. It dragged me a step like I weighed nothing. Its fingers tightened and I felt something in my arm give in a way that made me nauseous.

My free hand fumbled in my jacket pocket and found the one thing I’d thrown in there without thinking: a cheap road flare. I’d packed it because it was small and because I’d told myself, “It can’t hurt.”

My fingers shook so badly I almost dropped it.

I popped the cap, scraped the tip, and for half a second nothing happened and I thought I’d just died doing something stupid.

Then it lit.

A violent red flame, hissing, bright enough to turn the trees into hard-edged black silhouettes.

The creature jerked back like the light hit it physically. Its grip loosened. Not a full release, but enough.

I ripped my arm free and stumbled backward, holding the flare out between us like a spear.

In the red light I saw more of it. Legs too long. Knees bending in a way that looked half backwards. Skin mottled like bruises under thin flesh. Dark stains around its mouth that weren’t fresh but weren’t old enough to be nothing.

It didn’t charge.

It watched the flare with the same tilted-head curiosity, clicking softly.

Then it did something that snapped the situation into a new, colder shape.

It looked past the flare.

Down at the ground.

Toward where the radio had slid.

It took a slow step toward it, careful, like it didn’t want to get close to the flare.

Another step.

It wasn’t focused on me. It wanted the radio.

My throat tightened. I backed away, flare held out, and realized the “ranger” voice hadn’t been trying to save me. It had been trying to keep me moving, keep me talking, keep me transmitting.

Like a lure.

Like a line it could follow.

The creature crouched, long limbs folding wrong, and picked up the radio with those stick-like fingers. It turned it over as if it understood what it was holding.

Then the radio clicked.

And from the speaker, not from my hand now but from the thing’s hand, came the voice again.

Calm. Patient.

“Describe what you see.”

The creature lifted its head, still holding the radio, and the dull reflective points of its eyes turned to me.

I felt my stomach drop through the floor.

I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. I turned and limped away as fast as my ankle would let me, flare burning down in my hand, my left arm throbbing and numb where it had grabbed me.

The clicking breath moved with me, not rushing, not fading. Just staying close enough to remind me it could.

The flare shortened quickly, heat biting my palm. Red sparks spat into the dark.

I forced myself to follow the trail because stepping off into the trees felt like stepping off a dock at night. You don’t know what you’ll hit until you do.

Ahead, through the trees, I saw something angular and straight. Not a branch. Not a trunk.

A signpost.

I limped toward it and almost cried when I saw the reflective letters catch the flare light.

TRAIL 6

SERVICE ROAD 0.4

RANGER STATION 1.2

My brain snagged on that last line.

RANGER STATION.

Deeper.

Not out.

The flare hissed lower. The light dimmed.

From off to my right, through the trees, I heard the radio again.

A little burst of static.

A click.

Then my own voice, thin and distant, as if someone had learned the shape of it and was practicing.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I froze.

The sound didn’t come from behind. It came from the side, like it was trying to draw my attention off the trail. Toward the trees. Toward the direction that sign said “RANGER STATION.”

My chest tightened hard enough to hurt.

I turned my face away from the sound and forced my feet to move toward “SERVICE ROAD 0.4.”

Every step on that ankle was a bright spike of pain. My left arm felt heavy and wrong. I could feel bruising spreading under my skin.

The flare died with a wet sputter.

Darkness swallowed everything.

I stood still for a second because my eyes were useless and my panic was loud. Then I heard it again. The clicking breath, closer, patient.

I moved.

I walked by feel, hands out, fingertips catching branches, following the faint line of packed dirt underfoot. I slipped once on loose gravel and almost went down. I caught myself against a tree and felt bark dig into my scraped palm.

The radio crackled in the trees.

Sometimes it was static. Sometimes it was my voice repeating the same few words. Sometimes it was that calm “ranger” voice saying, “You’re almost there.”

After what felt like an hour but was probably ten minutes, the ground changed under my boots.

Gravel.

Then flat, hard-packed gravel.

A road.

I stepped forward and the tree line opened just enough that I could make out a darker shape ahead.

A metal gate.

I stumbled to it and grabbed it with both hands like it was a lifeline. The metal was cold. I pressed my forehead to it and pulled in air that tasted like rust and sap.

Behind me, the radio static swelled.

Close.

I turned slowly.

I couldn’t see it in the dark, but I could hear it. The clicking breath, a soft scrape of something moving through brush just off the road, staying in the cover of trees.

The radio clicked.

“Open the gate,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound like a ranger anymore. It sounded strained, like the words were being forced out through a mouth that didn’t fit them.

“I can’t,” I whispered, because my brain was still treating it like a conversation.

“Open it,” the voice repeated.

And under the words, the clicking breath accelerated, excited.

I backed away from the gate, then stopped, because backing away meant stepping closer to the sound.

I stood in the middle of the service road, gravel under my boots, and tried to think.

Cars used service roads. Rangers used service roads. If I followed it long enough, I’d hit something. A lot. A building. A sign. Anything.

Staying still felt like waiting to be taken.

I chose movement.

I limped down the road, faster than my ankle wanted, gravel crunching underfoot. To my right, in the tree line, something moved with me, quiet and effortless.

Every few seconds, the radio voice tried a new angle.

“Turn back.”

“You’re going the wrong way.”

“Your car is not there.”

Then, softer, using my voice again, like it was trying to sound concerned.

“Hey… hey… where are you?”

I didn’t answer. I bit down on my tongue and kept moving.

The road curved. The trees thinned.

And then, ahead, I saw the faint outline of a vehicle.

My car.

The pull-off.

I almost fell from relief. My hands shook so badly I dropped my keys once, then found them by feel and hit the unlock button.

The beep sounded like the best noise I’ve ever heard.

I got the driver’s door open and folded into the seat, dragging my bad ankle in like it didn’t belong to me. Pain flashed up my leg. I slammed the door and locked it.

For a second, I sat there in the dark, breathing hard, staring straight ahead like that would keep me safe.

Then I looked at my side mirror.

At the edge of the pull-off, where gravel met trees, something stood half-hidden in the brush.

Tall. Too thin. Motionless.

In one hand, a small green glow.

My radio.

It lifted the radio slightly, as if showing it to me.

Then the speaker crackled.

And the voice that came out was mine, careful and patient, exactly the way I’d sounded when I thought help was real.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I turned the key.

The engine coughed, then caught. The dashboard lit up.

The headlights snapped on, bright white, flooding the pull-off.

The brush at the edge of the trees was empty.

No movement. No shape. No glowing radio.

Just branches and shadow.

I didn’t wait. I threw the car into reverse, gravel spraying, and drove like I was late for my own funeral.

I didn’t stop until I hit pavement. I didn’t stop until I saw another vehicle’s taillights. I didn’t stop until I found the park office, a dark building with a big sign and an emergency phone mounted on the wall.

I called.

I told the person on the other end that I was injured, lost, and something had chased me. I didn’t say “wendigo.” I didn’t say “monster.” I said “an animal” because I needed them to send someone and I didn’t want to sound insane.

They told me to stay in my car with the doors locked until a ranger arrived.

A ranger truck rolled in twenty minutes later. Light bar flashing, tires crunching. The ranger was young, maybe late twenties, and he had the exhausted posture of someone who’d already worked a full day and then got pulled into someone else’s mistake.

He walked up to my window and I rolled it down an inch. I didn’t mean to, but the second I saw a uniform my throat tightened and my eyes burned.

He took one look at my hands and my ankle and swore under his breath.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “Okay. Okay. You did the right thing coming here.”

He helped me into his truck. The heater blew air that smelled like coffee and old vinyl. My body started shaking now that the danger was gone enough for my nerves to catch up.

On the drive to the clinic in the nearest town, he asked me what happened.

I told him the clean version first. Lost the trail. Radioed for help. Got turned around. Something grabbed me.

I didn’t talk about the voice using my voice until the words fell out by accident.

“It repeated me,” I said, staring at my bruised arm. “Like… like it was throwing my words back.”

The ranger’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.

“What channel were you on?” he asked.

“Seven,” I said. “The ranger frequency.”

His eyes flicked to me, quick.

“That’s not ranger dispatch,” he said.

My mouth went dry. “Then who answered me?”

He didn’t answer right away. He watched the road ahead like he was reading it.

Finally he said, “Nobody should have.”

The clinic wrapped my ankle, checked my wrist, cleaned the scrapes on my palms. The bruises on my forearm had started to bloom dark purple by then, finger-shaped, too long. The nurse asked if I’d gotten caught in wire.

I nodded because it was easier than explaining I’d been grabbed by something that didn’t move like a person.

When I came out, the ranger was still there. He stood by his truck with his hands in his jacket pockets like he didn’t want to leave me alone to walk to my car.

“Did you find my radio?” I asked, and I hated how small my voice sounded.

He shook his head. “No.”

I swallowed. “Is there… is there an old ranger station out there? Like an actual tower?”

He hesitated, then sighed like he’d made a decision.

“There’s a decommissioned lookout,” he said. “Old structure. Not staffed. We don’t use it.”

“So the voice could’ve been someone messing with me,” I said, trying to find a normal explanation to cling to.

He looked tired, and for a second he looked older than he was.

“It’s possible,” he said. “But listen to me. If you ever camp again, you do not call for help on random channels. You call the emergency number. You stay put. You don’t let a voice tell you to walk deeper. You understand?”

I nodded.

He leaned closer, lowering his voice like the night could hear us.

“And if you hear your own voice come back at you,” he added, “you stop transmitting.”

I stared at him.

“You’ve heard that?” I asked.

He didn’t answer directly. He just said, “Dispatch got weird traffic tonight. On that channel. We thought it was interference at first.”

“What kind of traffic?”

He rubbed his jaw like he didn’t want to say it.

“A man asking for help,” he said finally. “Saying he was lost. Saying he was on Trail Six.”

My stomach dropped.

“That was me,” I whispered.

He shook his head once.

“No,” he said. “It started before you called. And it kept going after you stopped.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Not really. I lay in my apartment with my ankle propped up and my forearm throbbing and I kept hearing that clicking breath in the back of my head, like my brain had recorded it and didn’t know how to delete it.

Two days later, in daylight, I went back to the park office. I told myself I was going to file a report about the radio. I told myself I wanted closure.

The woman behind the counter was older, hair pulled back, eyes sharp in the way people get after years of dealing with strangers who don’t read rules.

I gave her my name and the date. She typed into her computer. Her nails clicked against the keys.

“No lost property matching that,” she said.

I nodded like I expected it.

Then I asked, carefully, “Do you get… strange radio calls? People using the wrong channel?”

Her eyes shifted, just a fraction, to a binder on the desk behind her. A plain three-ring binder with a white label strip.

She didn’t reach for it. She didn’t have to.

“There are signs in the brochure kiosk,” she said, voice neutral. “About emergency procedures.”

“I saw those,” I said. “They don’t mention radio channels.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her tone did. It got flatter.

“We don’t provide radio channels,” she said. “Not anymore.”

“Why?”

She stared at me for a moment like she was deciding how much truth a stranger deserved.

Then she slid a piece of laminated paper across the counter. Not a brochure. Not a map. Something that looked like it had been printed in-house and updated a hundred times.

It had one line in bold at the top:

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

Below that were three bullet points. Short. Clinical.

	•	If you are lost, stay on trail and stay put.

	•	Use emergency phones or call 911 if service is available.

	•	If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

My mouth went dry.

“That’s a weird thing to have to print,” I said.

She didn’t smile.

“It became necessary,” she said.

I tried to speak. My throat felt tight.

“Has anyone… been hurt?” I asked.

She paused long enough that my stomach sank again, then said, “People get found. People don’t get found. Same as any park.”

She reached under the counter and pulled out a small plastic bag.

Inside was a handheld radio. Not mine. Different brand. Same cheap shape. Mud dried into the grooves.

She set it on the counter like evidence.

“We find these sometimes,” she said. “Not often. Usually they’re dead. Sometimes they’re still on.”

I stared at it.

“What do you do when they’re still on?” I asked.

Her eyes met mine.

“We turn them off,” she said. “And we don’t stand there listening.”

I left after that. I didn’t argue. I didn’t ask for the location of the decommissioned lookout. I didn’t ask about the binder. I didn’t want to.

I drove home with both hands tight on the wheel and the irrational feeling that if I relaxed my grip, the car would drift into the trees.

Here’s the last thing I’ll say, because it’s the part I can’t explain away.

Last night, I was cleaning out my pack. Shaking dirt out of the seams. Counting what I’d lost.

I found the flare wrapper in a side pocket and the edge of the paper map, folded wrong from when I’d yanked it out. I found a smear of dried blood on the strap where my wrist scraped it when I fell.

And tucked into the smallest inside pocket, the one I never use, I found a strip of reflective tape.

The same kind that had been on the ground.

Damp. Cold, even though it had been inside my apartment for days.

When I held it up to the light, I saw something stuck to the adhesive.

A single dark hair, coarse and stiff, like it didn’t belong to any animal I know.

I threw the tape away. I took the trash out immediately. I washed my hands until my skin was raw.

And later, lying in bed with my ankle throbbing and my arm bruised and my phone charging on the nightstand, I heard a sound that made my whole body lock up.

A soft burst of static.

A click.

Not from outside. Not from the woods.

From somewhere in my apartment, close enough that I could hear the tiny speaker distortion.

Then, very quietly, my own voice, patient and calm, asking the same question it asked the night I thought help was real.

At my shop, we get the occasional drink voucher or small gift card from reps, but it’s never anything huge and it’s usually tied to pushing a specific product. I’ve been wondering:

* Do any of your stores ever do bigger gift‑card incentives (like “hit X sales goal, enter to win a big Starbucks card” or similar)?
* Does that actually motivate baristas, or does it feel like corporate dangling a carrot instead of just paying more per hour?
* If you had control, what kind of coffee‑related rewards or perks would actually feel fair and appreciated?

Curious to hear what different chains and independents are doing.

1qaqwtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirTravelIndia/comments/1qaqwtx/indigo_nightmare_at_ahmedabad_yesterday/,Indigo Nightmare at Ahmedabad yesterday,"Indigo needs a management overhaul. The level of mismanagement is something else nowadays. I was booked on the 8.30 pm flight to Mumbai from Ahmedabad yesterday and around 5 pm the saga started. First message - flight delayed to 9.15 pm at 6 pm, the second message that flight is delayed to 10.15 pm, I waited at a hotel till 7.30 pm and since there was no other message, I left for the airport at 8 pm.  After the security cheque, the departure time had shifted again to 11 pm ... finally the flight took off around 12.45 am and landed around 2 am. Indigo did provide snack boxes and free water but the level of communication was so poor. The aircraft is on runway in Mumbai, it is just taking off from Mumbai, it is just landing in Ahmedabad.. these answers were given at various times over the evening much to the frustration of people. Similar scenes were being played out at the other Indigo gates with a long delayed Delhi flight at the next gate and other flights with shorter delays. The aircraft itself was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have been in. the legroom was so poor and the seat back angle was 90 degrees, just no way you could find a comfortable position to be in even for the short hop to Mumbai. There were lot of people screaming at the ground crew but I really think its pointless it is not in their hands, the poor guys are struggling just like us with bad information and a shitty evening. 

  
The best part was that I did not have a printed boarding card and had checked in on the app and used that boarding card with Digiyatra. The flight stopped showing on the Indigo app after its originally scheduled departure of 8.30 pm, the app did not update the revised times at all, so if I did not have a printed boarding card (which i did not) or Digiyatra, I would be sitting without a boarding card after completing security and before boarding and would have to run around to figure that out. There is no option on the app to retain the boarding card or access it once the flight has departed. This was also my mistake since i did not email it to myself or take a screenshot in advance. Note for the future - always print out the boarding card. 

I am old enough to remember the amazing brand that Indigo was at launch with the iconic commercial of On-time is a wonderful thing, a no frills but not a low cost carrier with great marketing, good crew and comfortable enough seats. It its sad to see it being reduced to this. I can only blame the management and the current CEO. Air India thankfully is getting rid of Campbell Wilson, what will it take to get rid of Peter Elbers and get a decent leader, the likes of those who conceptualised and built the original Indigo. There are good aviation hands in India like Sanjiv Kapoor who built Vistara or even the someone from the pre-Elbers Indigo management.  The 2 'Global CEOs' have done a fantastic job of destroying the brands they were supposed to steward, isn't it time for some fresh faces who know India and the business. 

Finally, why can't Ahmedabad get a decent airport, I remember the awful airport it used to be when I used to fly there regularly till about 2018. This was my first trip in 5 years and I feel that the new domestic terminal is at best a marginal improvement. Uncomfortable seats, crowded af, hardly any convenient charging sockets, not too many spaces to relax or even decent coffee shops and restaurants with seating areas. Ahmedabad is an emerging metropolis of India and the home of one of India's richest states. Perhaps if we stop handing over every airport to Adani, who has no expertise in building or managing airports we might again see some nice airports being built in this country. So far all I see of Adani built airports is bland, boring designs without character and usurious pricing - Compare the shit show that is NMIA to the original CSMIA (though Adani seems to be doing their best to make CSMIA also into a crowded hellhole by plonking retail outlets wherever there is an empty space), Mangaluru airport is not much different, the only good thing is that Mangaluru is a small town to its not crowded and neither is Trivandrum any better. 

I know this is a long rant, but shouldn't the Civil Aviation Ministry mandate compensation beyond a 100-200 rupee snack box for a 4-5 hour delay of a flight? If we are late even by 10 min, we lose all our money and an airline has to pay for a 4-5 hour delay with a box containing a sad cheese sandwich, a samosa and a mazaa tetrapak. Indigo was not mandated to provide an alternate flight for this delay, which made a short 1.5 hour flight into a 8 hour plus nightmare. Shouldn't Indigo or any other airline be mandated to compensate for long delays. E.g if a flight is delayed beyond 2 hours, a Rs. 1000 airline voucher to all affected passengers and an additional 500 rupee per added hour of delay capped at say Rs. 3000.  . Isn't the Ministry of Civil Aviation responsible for equitable passenger's rights? Delays upto 2 hours can happen which is understandable but why should passengers be penalised for airline's and airports inefficiencies without compensation for longer delays ?

1qaqwbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1qaqwbn/avoidant_exes_and_their_rebounds/,Avoidant exes and their rebounds,"So I got discarded by my FA ex 6 months ago.   We were together for 3 years, shared pets and a home and were engaged. (She actually pushed the proposal and moving in together) I got discarded and told she is too unwell to be a partner and she needs to heal her trauma etc. 

She then rebounded back to her ex 2 weeks after the discard. After telling me for 3 years how there were no romantic feelings left between them and the sex was so bad and he has no ambition and bores her. 

Anyway she declared her undying love to him 2 weeks after discarding me and talking to me like I am a piece of trash, plastered photos of him all over the home we used to share and told everyone that this is her new boyfriend.

He was not her new boyfriend, this guy is the doormat and the regulator. She also never posts him on her instagram, because deep down she knows this. 

Before we met they were together for 2 months then she dumped him, tried with another guy (who saw her red flags and ran) She then went back to this ex and this time moved in with him and discarded him again after 4 months together, she moved out the same day. Then she love bombed me about 5 months after discarding him. Ruined me for 3 years. Discarded me and went back to him AGAIN. 

And then dumped him for the 3rd time. They crashed and burned really quickly, as usual, it lasted 3 months. 

The triangulation and constant push-pull was such a mind fuck. She pushed for contact with her 2 exes early on in the relationship and I was not comfortable with that at all. Slowly she eroded my boundaries and I remember the waves of discomfort and the arguments we had because I pushed back. She gaslit me into feeling like it is immature to have boundaries around exes. I was uncomfortable with the guy, it felt like he was just hanging around, being her lapdog and waiting for more scraps and another chance to crawl into her bed. When we just started dating, he would text, begging her for a coffee. Then she would show me her response, even though I didn't ask, telling him she thinks it is not fair to me because we are not established as a couple yet. Her apparent transparency was a clever way of getting me to drop my guard and question my discomfort. It was mental gymnastics. Later on she started to bread crumb him more frequently to keep him in her orbit. Check-ins about his cat etc.

And in the end she proved me right. So trust your gut and stick to your boundaries. 

 These rebounds don’t last, and if they do, it’s built on dysfunction and distance. It soothed her and then it becomes empty and bores her. Eventually he irritates her and she dumps him. This guy is so compliant and just does whatever she says and wants so he gets these quick 3 month love bombs and stays in her orbit, but he never turns into a priority or something deep and intimate, and if you hit that intimacy fear of hers you get discarded, cast as the villain and then off she goes into the enabling arms of her parents. He’s in his 40s and she’s 38. And I can’t fathom how they still waste their time on games like this. It’s attractive to look at your shit and work on yourself. Heal and be the best version of you. But this just looks sad now. Happy, intimate, quality relationships that expand you, challenge you and help you grow and meet new versions of yourself, that’s beautiful. But when adults play these games it gets sad, empty and messy. It’s not a good look. It’s a sad one.

Worst of all is that I was engaged to someone who told me how trustworthy she was, how kind and gentle she was and this person had this cold inner world that she hid from me. I understood her anxiety and fear, but she was not just someone scared and looking for love. Her actions were cruel, calculated and all just about her ego and comfort. She opted for cruelty and her image over accountability and empathy. In the end she made a series of choices every time and had more control than I wanted to admit. 

At least we’re out of their storm. The clock is ticking and Instagram likes won’t keep her warm at night. I never ever want to go back to the horror of dating the real version of her but I still miss the idea I had of her and the promises she made. ",1,1768211697.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1qaqvrp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qaqvrp,Oily skin photo review - my fave Australian sunscreen v two Japanese sunscreens after 11+ hours of wear,"This is for my fellow oily skin people interested in Japanese sunscreens :)

Over the years I have tried a bunch of Australian sunscreens and come to accept that sunscreen will look shiny and greasy unless I blot throughout the day (reducing SPF effectiveness) or dust on a no-sebum powder (still not truly matte by the end of the day).

My favourite daily Australian sunscreen to date is the La Roche Posay Anthelios XL Dry Touch.

This picture review is how my fave Aus sunscreen survived 11 hours on my oily face (from application to me arriving home at the end of my work day), compared to two Japanese sunscreens commonly recommended for oily skin in the Aus skincare & AB subs.

**Japanese sunscreens worn:**

1. OMI Sun Bears Active Protect Milk UV Sunscreen - [Ratzilla entry](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/sun-bears-active-protect-milk/)
2. Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk (2024) - [Ratzilla entry](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-2024/)

From my lurking on these subreddits it was suggested Japanese 'milk' sunscreens would be \* Jake Peralta \* noice on oily skin, as they stand up to the humid climate in Japan.

I think the photos speak for themselves, however these were my general impressions of the Japanese sunscreens:

* **Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk (2024)**

This is the nicest sunscreen I have ever used. Comes out milky and runs down your finger so you have to slap it on quick. Dries down super quick. Rub resistant - feels durable on forehead under the rim of my hat, I can touch my face and feel hardly any residue/sebum picked up by my finger. Has an inoffensive faint scent that goes away after half an hour or so. Needs an oil cleanse to remove. I am seriously impressed by this product's shine control, and Anessa dethroned LRP as my new favourite sunscreen.

Eye sting with sweating? None.

Cast? Slight cast. Nothing that bothered me. 

* **OMI Sun Bears Active Protect Milk UV Sunscreen**

This is the second nicest sunscreen I have ever used. It is so cheap! To save a buck, I would be perfectly happy with the Sun Bears instead of Anessa.

Applies and feels very similar to Anessa, the differences being: dries down fast but not quite as quickly, less rub resistance (more residue left on my finger when touching my face), no noticeable fragrance to me although apparently it has a grapefruit scent, is very slightly more shiny in appearance. Excellent shine control. Needs an oil cleanse to remove.

Eye sting with sweating? None.

Cast? Slight cast. Nothing that bothered me.

**General notes:**

* I did not blot my face, or use a no sebum powder, or do anything to tone down the shine for the entire day before I took these photos.
* I tried to take photos avoiding the top half of my forehead. I wear a hat while commuting and the band does wear off some oil/sunscreen from the top of my forehead.",6,1768211639.0,AusSunscreen,0,0.88,False
1qaqvbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1qaqvbi/bf6_capture_point_design_discourages_ptfo_ruining/,BF6 capture point design discourages PTFO ruining the gameplay loop. Constructive feedback.,"A very short time after the game launched, I theorized that capture points might be the worst part of BF6's design, causing a lot of the frustration players have with the game and how chaotic it feels, particularly in conquest. 

Now I do think that on almost all conquest maps, current objective design leads to almost full collapse of the traditional conquest gameplay loop. 

Issues I diagnosed with the current design are as follows:

**1. Size and location.** 

**2. Almost mandatory single level placement without much verticality on the majority of the maps.** 

**3. Lack of large flanking paths to and from objectives, on tight, infantry focused maps(all of them)**

**4. Huge focus on maps having 5 objectives across the board. Even though their size does not support it.** 

**5. Objectives are often exposed from all sides, very noticeable on Blackwell fields, where just staying on the objective is impossible because of sniper fire.** 

Why do I think there was a conscious decision to make objectives as they are now? Well, their current design lowers time to engagement, and its clear that is what devs went after.

But the unintended consequence of this design is the fact that in most cases objectives that are being contested will change hands. Defensive play on objectives is almost nonexistent because it's pointless; by the time you spawn and again try to put yourself in small contested area where you are at a huge disadvantage, you might as well spawn elsewhere and take another objective that is less contested and that is allowed by general oversaturation of objectives.

**What this leads to is that instead of going after objectives to engage other people, players stay away from them**; fighting for objectives often happens outside of objective area, and taking an objective often is a game of throwing smoke, going prone in a corner, and praying nobody notices you. 

The map that does not have a single objective with this issue is Operation: Firestorm. 

You can quickly test what I am speaking about: join a conquest match on Iberian Offensive, notice what is average time of capturing an objective is, notice how long the objective is contested, how much player to player engagement there is on the objective, and then join Firestorm and look for the same parameters. You will notice a stark contrast. 

I had moments on Operation Firestorm where one single objective was contested and neutral for multiple minutes, where this constant tug of war between a few squads trying to capture it, was so noticeable. People often have enough time to take cover, and allow their squad to spawn on them. 

So there is an example of how to do it in the game today. 

Solutions: 

Every constructive feedback should present some solutions, so here are mine: 

**1. Iberian Offensive, Empire State, Siege of Cairo, New Sobek City could benefit from fewer objectives, Empire State and Iberian, are 3- or 4-objective linear maps in their design, like Metro and Locker.** Yes, they are open spaces and you can see the sky, but they are corridor-based. They basically play the same, like Metro or Locker. Make them linear with one large flanking route; there is no need to forcefully spread the fighting. Make fewer high-quality objectives. 

 **2. Make objectives vertical and extend their size.** I do understand smaller maps are an issue in BF6, and I do understand as a product of that capture zones had to be smaller, but there is no excuse for them being so small, without any verticality. Some of them are in multistore buildings, yet the objective is only contested on one level. Iberian ""B"" and ""C"" is perfect examples of how illogical that feels. If you are in the building of Objective ""C"", you have to jump from the 2nd floor, in a hell to defend it, instead of attackers being forced to flush you out from the 2nd floor, makes no sense from an immersion or gameplay standpoint. Just think, you are literally in the building; you should count as a defender. The same goes for objectives on New Sobek, and Mirak Valley

**3. Move objectives away from HQ**; ideally, with a reduction in the number of objectives, you remove the closest ones to HQ. The exception might be New Sobek. I think  objective ""C"" there is unnecessary.

**4. Make objectives logical strategic zones**, not some random points on the map like parking lots or a coffee table. Include structures, so there is option for CQB fighting inside objectives, yet enough cover for objectives to feel like safer zones for defending. Most objectives could just be extended to include surrounding buildings.  I mean, BF2042, after reworks to maps, did this very well.

That is it from me. As always, try to engage in conversation; you never know who might be reading.

When I was around 18-19 I got awfully sick and since then have had an autoimmune disorder (Lyme's) that just wonders around. Now, is it bad? Not at all. Is it horrible when my OCD wants it to be? Yes.

The issue I have now is that with Prozac, my anxiety is at bay. And when I consider who I was before Prozac, in terms of passion, zeal for life, and achievements, I miss that person. My biggest issue now is always being sleepy, not having too much going on, and not having something (perhaps anxiety) to propel me forward. I am quite Type A and very driven (middle child syndrome), and people have been telling me (since I started Prozac) I seem Type B... hell no. 

Anyways, all of this to say, I would like to start quitting but would also appreciate advice from those who stopped after years of taking Prozac or other meds for anxiety/OCD. I also have recently quit alcohol and coffee for the year, so that should help.

At the end of 2023 I bought a proper machine (profitec pro 400 + eureka mignon single grinder). We count every doppio/cappuccino that we make to keep track of the “coffee per cup”

Last week we made the 2600th cup of coffee, let me break down the numbers for you.

The total investment in hardware is approximately €2200. We buy our beans at a local roaster at €0.44 per cup. The milk for the cappuccino is approximately €0.36 per cup. The cappuccino vs doppio ratio is 1:2, bringing our average coffee/milk cost per cup to €0.56.

After 2600 cups (\~26 months, orange graph) we’ve spent a total of €3620(blue graph) on hardware+coffee+milk, decreasing the cost per cup to €1.40. (Brown graph)

If we had bought all the cups at our local coffee shop (€4), it would’ve set us back €10.400 (green graph).

Disclaimer: of course, with a proper espresso machine at home you drink more coffee that you’d buy at a cafe,  but the price per cup from the home setup is €1.39 vs €4 at the coffee shop is astonishing ;)

* **Pho with rice noodles** and a very hearty home made broth that can probably cure any cold and fever
* **Tonkotsu Ramen** \- made in the classic japanese ramen style with hand cut noodles and freshly made Chashu (and so much more! Don't want this to look like a food menu)

I’ll happily share recipes and the three ways I ruined them before they worked.

I’ve attempted sourdough starters five times. The 6th attempt is currently living on top of my fridge like a tiny, judgmental pet and I'll probably move it to the fridge for safe keeping if it does do the 100% rise. Best case scenario - If it survives, I may share a piece like it’s a family heirloom.

**2) Plants & hydroponic experiments (a slow‑motion saga)**

My balcony is basically: random plants, an assortment of seeds that may or may not become anything, and me cheering at new leaves like it’s the World Cup.

I love nursery runs. I love repotting. I love swapping cuttings. I cheer for new leaves like it’s the World Cup. I’m also trying hydroponics because I enjoy hobbies that come with a learning curve and mild chaos.

**3) Music & media (playlists are my love language, platonically)**

Music is a big part of my life and I listen to almost everything… except punk metal (we can still be friends, I’ll just step away respectfully).

I mostly listen to a lot of Indie, Indie Pop, Folk, and recently gotten into Japanese rock too!

Classical + jazz: I’m still exploring jazz like a polite guest who doesn’t want to touch anything fragile.

I also keep too many playlists: rainy day ones, road trip ones, late‑night “why am I awake?” ones, the whole thing. If we click, I will 100% make one named after you.

Headphones lore (for the fellow nerds): WH‑1000XM3 for travel, AirPods day‑to‑day.

**Shows I’ve enjoyed:** This is a very long list so I won't call it out but I really adore Sci-Fi shows, British Comedy, just old comedy shows, and a lot of really really terrible reality tv shows.

**4) Podcasts (road trips, chores, and “I need background noise to exist”)**

True crime for road trips, plus a mix of finance/books/movies/music pods for daily life.

I’m the guy who can do a long drive and somehow make it feel like we’re in a documentary… except we’re just looking for snacks and taking wrong turns.

**5) Books & writing (soft hours + occasional emotional damage)**

Lit fic to whatever steals my heart.

Ocean Vuong, Elif Shafak, Proust when I’m feeling brave… and yes, I still love the comfort of classics too.

I write letters to my future self, to friends, sometimes to the versions of people I miss. If you write, I’m your most enthusiastic reader. (hint: I've written one for you too!)

Also: I attempt crosswords. I get frustrated. I abandon them. I return later like nothing happened. This is my cycle. Please respect my journey.

**6) Games & tech (PS5 co‑op friends, please)**

I’m on PS5 and actively looking for co‑op buddies.

Loved God of War: Ragnarok

Big on story‑heavy/open worlds (RDR2, Horizon)

Currently playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

I’m chill on voice, zero toxicity, happy to learn. I’m here for laughs, not for turning gaming into unpaid stress.

**7) Outdoorsy… ish (with strong “ish” energy)**

I love road trips, easy hikes, and the dream of doing a lot of really super hard treks I keep threatening to do.

I also like lakes, can’t swim well, and still end up fishing (catch‑and‑release mostly). Yes, it’s ironic. No, I will not be taking feedback at this time.

**8) Creativity & collections**

I’m learning digital art on Procreate on the iPad I spent a month’s salary on and sometimes regret not using enough (accountability buddies welcome).

I also hoard stamps and boarding passes like tiny anchors to memory.

**9) The vibe / the fine print**

Mostly golden‑retriever energy (I will hype you up). Occasionally I need quiet to recharge (introvert reboot). I’ve had brushes with anxiety and the blues; I try to be the friend I needed then: consistent, kind, honest.

I don’t disappear forever but if I go quiet, I return and pick up right where we left off.

**What I’m looking for (and what I’m not)**

* **Friends.** Friendship‑friendship. The kind that grows and sticks.
* **Adults (18+)** of any age, gender, sexuality or anything. No age cap. You just have to be a good human.
* **Effortful conversation.** Not essays. just… more than “hey” and “wyd.”
* **Nearby (Bangalore)?** Let’s actually meet: public, easy, low‑pressure hangs.
* **Not nearby?** Still yes: consistent chats + a weekly/biweekly voice call works great but if you're here, I'd love to meet in person and catch up often!
* **Boundaries:** I don’t judge your choices; just don’t push them on me or anyone else. Kindness over coolness.

**Things we could actually do (menu of small beginnings)**

Pick one. Or pitch your own.

* Chai/coffee + walk + playlist swap (you judge my taste; I pretend I don’t care).
* Co‑working session (mics off, lo‑fi on, meme breaks + colleague rants allowed).
* PS5 co‑op (friendly, chill, “we laugh even when we lose” energy).
* Bookshop crawl + café reading + “pick a book for each other.”
* Plant‑swap + nursery visit + trying not to adopt twelve new pots (we will fail with dignity).
* Potluck where one dish is “nailed it?” in the truest sense.
* Plan a trek/drive we actually do (bonus points if snacks are elite and jokes are terrible).

**Why you might like being friends with me**

* I show up. I keep my word. I don’t ghost.
* I’m a great vent‑listener and a decent advice‑giver (only if you want it).
* I’ll celebrate your tiny wins like they’re grand finales.
* If you’re having a 4am wobble, I’m more likely to be awake than asleep.
* I write little notes for people I care about. (Consent first. Nobody needs a surprise novella.)
* If we share a city, I’m the “I’ll be there in 20” friend… minus the shovel joke. (…unless you think it’s funny. Then, kidding.)

**How to message me (so we skip the awkward opener)**

Send me a DM with:

1. **Where you are** (Bangalore neighborhood / city / country / time zone)
2. **One thing you’re obsessed with lately** (song/book/game/recipe/plant/weird fact)
3. **One tiny plan for the next 2 weeks** you’d do with me (from the menu above)
4. **Where you prefer to chat** (we start on Reddit; move elsewhere if both comfy)

Optional cheat code: work the word **“cinnamon”** into your message so I know you actually read this and aren’t a “hey wyd” drive‑by.

**And as promised - A small letter to the friend I haven’t met yet**

I don’t know you yet, but I have this quiet belief that you exist somewhere between a half‑finished playlist and a “seen at 2:13am” message you meant to reply to.

Maybe you’re in Bangalore too, walking past cafés like you’re browsing a menu you’re too tired to choose from. Maybe you’re far away, collecting your days in a different time zone, wondering why it’s so hard to build something steady when everyone’s rushing.

Here’s what I do know: I’m good at the small things. I’m good at showing up. I’m good at turning ordinary days into something a little less heavy: not by pretending life is easy, but by being the kind of person who makes room at the table when grief sits beside joy. I’m the friend who’ll send you a song because the lyrics reminded me of your sentence from earlier. The one who’ll ask “reached?” and mean it. The one who’ll hype your tiny wins like they’re grand finales.

If we do this right, it won’t be dramatic. It’ll be consistent. It’ll be:  
*chai walks where we talk about nothing and everything,*  
*co‑working in comfortable silence,*  
*swapping recipes and laughing at my fifth failed starter,*  
*me pointing at a tiny green tomato like it’s a miracle (because it is),*  
*you telling me the last time you laughed so hard you snorted,*  
*and both of us making Tuesdays feel a little less like Tuesdays.*

So send me the message you’ve been drafting in your head. The one with the real details. The one that sounds like you.

I’ll bring cinnamon (the spice), memes, and a playlist with your name on it.

**TL;DR:** Bangalore guy with food/plant/music/books/games/outdoors energy, **seeking long‑term friends** (nearby or online). Kindness + effortful conversation + no ghosting. DM with a real intro and a small plan.",1,1768210913.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1qaqnfj,https://youtu.be/xa-4IAR_9Yw?si=OaJ-c7hpieYvdWSe,Is she into you?,"I know a lot of guys have trouble picking up on the signs of whether or not a girl is into them. So, today I want to do a little quiz so you can see if she actually does like you, or even just how good you are at recognizing signals that you might be getting.  

Let's say you're in a bar and you look across the length of the counter and you see a cute girl who glances at you briefly, does a quick hair flip, and then turns back to her friends. Is she into you? Uh, eye contact is obviously a good sign, but you really can't tell from this example. She could just be adjusting her hair and maybe she was looking at someone behind you.  

So, let's say you're at the office and your cute co-worker is waiting behind you to make some copies of whatever people make copies of and she says, ""Wow, do you think you could go any slower?"" And then playfully punches your arm. Is she into you? Uh, again, you can't really tell from this example either. She might like you, but she might just be giggling and punching your arm as a sarcastic middle school throwback. So, really no way to tell. 

Okay, so let's say you're at the gym on the elliptical for some reason and Cutie McBooty comes in and gets on the exercise bike in front of you. Uh, and then after five minutes, she looks back and says, ""Wow, I'm so sweaty already. If only there were a way to get the same workout at home riding something else."" Then gives you a wink. She into you? Yeah, I still can't tell without one. Um, exercise equipment is pretty expensive and maybe she lives in a small apartment and just doesn't have space. So maybe you find a good deal on rowing machine somewhere, you can show her the flyer.  

Okay, so let's say you meet up with a friend that you've had coffee and drinks with a couple times and she says, ""I had a lot of fun on the last few dates we went on."" That's a good sign because she thought those hangouts were actually dates. So suppose then she says, ""How'd you like to come back to my place and watch Netflix tonight?"" That's another good sign. Uh it's usually a pretty good indicator when a girl invites you to do something, especially at her place. So then let's say later at her house, you guys are watching Wall-E or something like that and she says, ""I'm getting pretty bored. Why don't you come upstairs with me?"" That's another great sign. She probably has something pretty interesting to do upstairs if it's better than watching Wall-E. So then after you go up there, all of a sudden, she pushes you onto her bed, dims the lights, rips off her clothes, and you start having sex. Is she into you? Yeah. Again, you really can't be too sure. It's pretty dark in the room, so she can't really see you properly. Maybe she's from Canada and was just being polite. Anyway, best bet is to just keep your wits about you and continue to look for signs.",12,1768210763.0,bodylanguage,0,0.93,False
1qaqn4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qaqn4d/questions_you_will_never_answer/,"Questions, you will never answer","How are you these days?

Are you still drowning in deadlines and workloads your boss keeps throwing at you?

Is your to do list still endless, your inbox still full of unread emails?

Do you still struggle to sleep at night still take a drink after work just to quiet your thoughts? Do you still drink your coffee scalding hot and finish it in less than five minutes because you always said you wanted it that way?

Do you still eat chicken like there’s no other choice in the world?

And does your back still itch whenever stress gets the best of you?

I ask these questions in my diary every night. But I write them here now because I can’t ask you anymore. You’ve left me on delivered for so long… maybe even blocked me already. So this is the only place my words can still reach you.

I’m still the same person you met at that club.

But I don’t party anymore.

Because every loud song feels like your voice, every crowded room feels like the chance I might see you and I’m scared I’d run straight back into your arms if I did.

I avoid everything that reminds me of you.

And yet here I am… still asking how you’ve been.

Funny how love leaves, but the questions stay.

Always,

We had an extension built with the request to have an electrical radiator, 8 internal sockets for powering items like lights, kettle, coffee machine and two external garden sockets for a garden shredder and corded lawn mower.

We were having issues that the room being very cold and we discovered the radiator installed by the electrician was too small at 330w and we wanted to upgrade to a 1.5kw heater based on three separate BTU calculators and the opinion of the manufacturer of the radiators but were advised by the electrician he wouldn't advise it as he hadn't wired it to accept amps of that level. 

He says he came off the existing supply which is the Type B MCBs 32A which powers the first floor sockets. So he spurred off that to have 13amps for the electrical radiator, 8 internal sockets for powering items like lights, kettle, coffee machine and two external garden sockets for garden shredder and corded lawn mower and another spur down to 5amps for the lighting. 

I am not an expert but trying to read through BS 7671 guidance it seems he should have at least put the heater on a seperate new circuit?",1,1768210620.0,DIYUK,7,1.0,False

I mentioned my plan to my gf and she said she thinks it's weird that I want to go away on my own when I'm in a relationship.

I pointed out being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to do everything together. She asked what it would mean for our trips and I said it'll just mean we only have one holiday this year

She said our trips shouldn't be reduced just because I decide to go away but I just reminded her we haven't even got anything planned for this year so it's not like I'm cancelling already made plans and I mentioned we usually only have one holiday anyway.

She just said I shouldn't be doing it and that going away on my own isn't something I should be considering when I'm in a relationship.

1qaqeg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1qaqeg1/sharing_my_understanding_about_2025_vietnam/,Sharing my understanding about 2025 Vietnam Economic,"Hi guys. Recently Vietnam officially released its 2025 economic data, and it is pretty interesting to look at. If you’re running a factory in Vietnam like we do, living in Vietnam, or just curious about Vietnam country, this might be relevant to you!

# Vietnam’s overall economy in 2025

GDP growth rate: 8.02%

GDP per capita: about USD 5,026, passing the USD 5,000 mark for the first time

Total trade value: about USD 930 billion, with imports and exports up around 18% compared with last year

My understanding:

Breaking through USD 5,000 per capita GDP is a meaningful milestone. For example, the local auto industry, like VinFast, may benefit a lot from this. In economics, once per capita GDP reaches around USD 5,000, demand for cars and home appliances usually grows much faster, and these industries tend to take off.

# Regional differences in Vietnam’s manufacturing development

Right now, manufacturing is growing faster in the north than in the south.

Northern region (Red River Delta): growth reached about 10.5%–11.2% in 2025. Quang Ninh (11.89%), Hai Phong (11.81%), and Bac Ninh (10.27%) are among the top performers nationwide.

Southern region (Southeast): growth was around 7.2%–7.9%. Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong are still major hubs, but their growth is clearly below the national average.

Why this is happening:

One major reason is geography. Northern Vietnam borders China, making it a prime location for the “China + 1” strategy. Electronic components and raw materials for manufacturing can enter northern Vietnam through land border gates at lower logistics costs, and land transport is simpler and cheaper than seaports for many goods. People also say in the north have better road networks, but I don’t have a factory in the north of Vietnam, so I don’t know much details about it.

My understanding:

What many people don’t realize is how big this land-transport advantage actually is. I run a factory in Binh Duong in southern Vietnam, so I feel this very directly. Our manufacturing still relies heavily on components imported from China(Especially the machines and machine parts). Every month we ship at least one container from China to Vietnam. If you look only at transport cost and delivery time, the northern provinces definitely have the advantage.

# 2025 Sources of New Foreign Investment in Vietnam

Among investors from 90 countries and regions with newly licensed projects in 2025:

Singapore was the largest, with about USD 4.84 billion, accounting for 27.9 percent of newly registered capital.

China Mainland ranked second with USD 3.64 billion, or 21 percent.

Hong Kong ranked third with USD 1.73 billion, or 10 percent.

Japan invested USD 1.62 billion (9.4 percent).

Sweden invested USD 1.0 billion (5.8 percent).

Taiwan invested USD 965.8 million (5.6 percent).

This part confused me a bit. I understand that most investment from mainland China goes into factories. But what about the other countries and regions? What exactly are they investing in? So I dug into it one by one.

# Singapore:

1. Industrial parks. This makes perfect sense. For example, in Binh Duong there are two well-known parks: VSIP 1 and VSIP 2 (often called “Singapore 1” and “Singapore 2”).
2. Real estate. Large Singaporean developers are also active in Vietnam’s property market.

# Hong Kong:

Mainly ports and terminals, such as investments in Quang Ninh, plus industrial parks. In short: infrastructure and logistics.

# Japan:

Mostly manufacturing. For example, SMC, a big manufacturer of automatic control equipment, produces valves used in semiconductor manufacturing. Since setting up in Vietnam in 2014, its total investment is expected to reach USD 1 billion. Generally speaking, Japanese investment tends to be driven by large corporations.

# Sweden:

In the first seven months of 2025, Sweden’s registered investment in Vietnam exceeded USD 1.02 billion, compared with only USD 168,000 in the same period of 2024. That’s a huge jump. It made Sweden the biggest Nordic investor in Vietnam, ahead of Denmark (USD 83.91 million) and Norway , and eighth among all foreign investors.

This was quite surprising. Why did Sweden suddenly increase its investment in Vietnam?

Swedish investment is mainly in manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, ICT, and renewable and green energy.

Vietnam mainly exports electronics to Sweden, such as phones, machinery, and garments. Vietnam mainly imports advanced medical equipment and pharmaceuticals from Sweden. So the cooperation pattern looks quite traditional: Vietnam sends electronics and light manufacturing; Sweden sends high-end medical technology and products.

# Taiwan:

Mostly manufacturing, especially contract manufacturing represented by Foxconn. There is also some investment in healthcare and real estate, but on a smaller scale.

# How is Vietnam’s trade surplus?

Total trade was about USD 930 billion, with a trade surplus of roughly USD 20 billion.

That basically means imports of USD 455 billion and exports of USD 475 billion.

Does this mean Vietnam’s value added is relatively low? In many cases, yes. Exports are large, but imported raw materials account for a big share, so the actual manufacturing margin is thin. Vietnam is still in an industrial upgrading phase, so heavy imports are normal. If the country reduces reliance on imported inputs later, the surplus may grow further.

One thing to note: about 70 percent of Vietnam’s exports come from foreign-invested companies. In the first quarter of 2025, domestic firms exported USD 29.02 billion, while foreign-invested firms exported USD 73.82 billion.

My understanding:

I am not entirely sure what Vietnam’s long-term industrial strategy is. From my point of view, most of the current trade is handled by foreign-invested enterprises, so the share left for local Vietnamese companies is not very large. The big question is whether local Vietnamese factories can grow with many potential foreign-invested factories orders, and if the local Vietnamese factories could win their potential competiters in China? If not, the factory might still prefer to import from China.

# How is Vietnam’s local supply chain developing?

Based on China’s experience, it is very common to see foreign companies dominate in the early stages of development. But those foreign companies usually need a whole ecosystem of supporting suppliers. Entry barriers for these supply chain industries are normally lower, which should, in theory, create opportunities for domestic Vietnamese factories to grow.

So how are local supporting industries in Vietnam doing right now?

From what I have seen, the progress is not very smooth. Many foreign-invested factories in Vietnam are still relying on regional or cross-border supply chains. Earlier I mentioned that a lot of factories in Vietnam still import components from China. As Chinese investors running factories in southern Vietnam, we feel this very directly. It is not that we do not want to buy locally. The problem is that, in many cases, the product simply does not exist in the local market. Even when there is a supplier, the price, quality, or product range often does not match our needs. I do not fully understand why this is the case; maybe Vietnam still needs more time?

For example, conveyor rollers are something almost every factory needs. Yet I have had a hard time finding reliable local Vietnamese suppliers for them, and in the end i still import from China.

From what I read in local reports, Vietnam’s domestic supporting industries are mainly concentrated in metalworking and basic parts, and mostly serve very large multinational corporations. But from my own experience as a medium-sized foreign manufacturer, there is still a lot of room for improvement. For companies like ours, it is still difficult to find suitable domestic suppliers in Vietnam. Maybe in a few years the situation will look different.

# Vietnamese Consumer

Domestic consumption in Vietnam has been quite strong. In 2025, around 170,000 Vinfast cars were sold in the local market, almost double compared with the previous year. This shows that local purchasing power is rising quite fast.

At first, I thought this was mainly because VinFast did very aggressive marketing. But after looking into it more, it seems VinFast is basically the only major domestic EV brand in Vietnam. So i assume its sales numbers more or less reflect the total market demand for locally produced electric cars.

But…..VinFast is still a controversial brand in two main ways.

First, its stock price. When VinFast listed in the US, its share price once hit USD 68.77 on August 25, 2023. Later, it fell sharply. As of January 8, 2026, it was about USD 3.42 per share.

Personally, I think the initial price surge was largely speculation. USD 68.77 was not reasonable. But VinFast is doing quite well in its Vietnam home market. It enjoys strong domestic support, and its presence on the streets is very visible. The newer small models are cheaper and easier to buy, and you can see them everywhere. Vietnamese consumers are very supportive of local brands, and VinFast benefits from that. So I think there is still some room for the stock to rise again, just probably not to those extremely high speculative levels.

The second controversy is product quality. Many foreign reviewers, especially English-language YouTube channels, criticize the quality and reliability of VinFast cars.

As for my own experience: I feel the seats are not very comfortable, too firm, and the infotainment screen can be laggy. I tried in VinFast taxis several times, and my biggest complaint is still seat comfort.

At the same time, wages in Vietnam have clearly risen. When I first started my factory in 2018, a monthly salary of 6 million VND for a worker was already attractive. By 2025, you usually need to offer around 12 million VND per month to be competitive. This shows how foreign investment and industrial growth are pushing up incomes.

On top of that, Vietnam is currently in an “economic upswing” period. People are confident about the future and willing to spend. Combined with Vietnam’s strong coffee culture and social lifestyle, this has boosted demand for better living standards. From what I see, people here are generally quite happy and very willing to consume.

# So, how is Vietnam really doing?

From the perspective of running a factory here, I would say things look pretty good. Wages have gone up and are relatively stable. You see more and more new VinFast cars on the road. In parks and nice public spaces, there are more people doing livestreams or content creation than before. All of this gives the feeling of a society that is moving upward and becoming more confident.

There are clearly a lot of economic opportunities in Vietnam right now. The real question for people like us, as foreign investors working and living here, is whether we can also take a share of that growth while contributing to it. Personally, I think the answer is yes.

I just want to share what I've been going through with some other people and see what folks have to say about it!  Hopefully find some like-minded people to chat with while I try to stay up all night to reset my sleep schedule.

So, I haven't considered myself a religious person for a very long time.  My family was not exactly on the compassionate and understanding side of the Christian spectrum, and so they naturally raised a daughter who rebelled hard against all kind of religious thought from the moment her age ended with -teen.  Now, I'm twenty-five, and for a while, I've been feeling a bit disconnected from the world.  I'm self-employed and don't really have anything tying me to society as a whole.  I rarely leave the house, don't participate in any holidays, and always hang out with the same small group of friends.  I don't feel like a part of any kind of culture.  I don't feel any link to people in the past or the future like I would like to.  I just feel like myself, cloistered in my little office, doing my little editing job, drinking my little cups of coffee.  And some days, that's totally fine with me, but other days, I really wish I felt like I was part of something bigger than myself.

Seemingly unrelated, I've been working with my therapist on ways to manage my particular brand of ADHD/autism.  Things I can do to tell my brain that it's time to focus on *this* thing, and that it will be time to focus on other things later.  She suggested doing some kind of ritual before starting an activity, even if it's as simple saying what the task is out loud.  Just something to specifically make it seem like the time I'm about to spend is set aside for the task I'm about to do.  My friends and I have been going through a bit of a Greek mythology kick, since we just got around to listening to Epic the Musical and the new season of the Percy Jackson show just came out.  So I thought, what the hell.  I'll give praying a shot.  Sounds like fun.

And honestly?  It's been great for me!  Just taking a second to clasp my hands together and give a heads up to Athena that I'd like her help noticing grammatical errors for the next hour or so, or honoring Hephaestus before working on some craft project, or asking Apollo to help me write something that my friends will like to read.  Even though I'm still definitely an atheist and especially don't believe in these particular gods, I've found that taking the time to *specifically* dedicate the next hour to this particular god helps keep me on task *and* helps the things I'm doing feel more important.

I still wouldn't call myself a ""neopagan"" or even a ""religious person,"" but adding this one little bit of ritual to my life has been fun and helpful.  I get a little spark of giddiness whenever I have friends coming over and I get to ask Dionysus to bless our gathering.

Earlier, I had invited Sophie to share my table in a busy café at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport, as there were no seats left.

‘Scared?’ I stroke my jaw for a moment. ‘No. I used to be scared, but it vanished five months ago, when I entered the first plane. What about you?’

‘You know,’ I continued, ‘It’s my second “big” trip. I did something similar almost a decade ago, for a couple of months, like you, and then went back to “real life”. I worked my way up the employment ladder, met a girl, got married, and thought this was what life was supposed to be.’  
A middle-aged woman wearing a long black dress and sunglasses huffed and puffed across the terminal, winding through the dense crowd to the sound of her flapping flip-flops and two heavy rolling suitcases.   
‘But, sitting at my desk, I would gaze at the window, wondering what was out there, faraway beneath the clouds were people I hadn’t met, places I hadn’t seen, adventures waiting.  
‘This feeling chewed on my soul harder every day; a voice was yelling at me: “What are you doing here? Go!” until I couldn’t focus on my work any more. But I kept pushing. I thought I had responsibilities and needed to focus on “real life”. In the meantime, my wife changed from the chill, life-before-work young woman I fell in love with to a money-obsessed, career-focused businesswoman. Everything became about saving for a house, a car, and eventually children. And the voice didn’t stop. The more I pushed, the louder it yelled. Until one day, a Saturday morning.’  
An airport announcement for a delayed flight to Jakarta repeated in three different languages. The elderly couple next to us rolled their eyes and laughed.  
‘She woke me up with a grave, estranged expression. Apparently, things got serious between her and her boss.’  
Sophie winced. ‘Oh no! I am sorry. This must have been terrible.’  
I looked down at my cappuccino. A lonely island of foam floated in the tawny beverage.  
‘I was mad, but not at her. At myself.’  
‘But she cheated on you.’  
‘Yes, but… I gave up my agency, the direction of my life.’  
‘What do you mean?’ The young woman goggled at me, puzzled.  
‘When she confessed, I realised I should have left a long time ago. I knew I wanted to quit a career that wasn’t for me, a relationship that wasn’t for me, a life that wasn’t me. But I kept pushing it down because I was scared. It was easier to cede this responsibility to her and my job than to stand for myself. I realised the inner voice wasn’t yelling. It was crying. And, though it was a violent slap in the face, I am grateful.’  
I took a sip of my now tepid coffee. Sophie glanced at her empty bubble tea.  
‘So what now? Do you know what you’ll do with your life? Any epiphany or love affair with a mysterious stranger?’  
‘Not yet.’ We laughed.  
‘For now, I enjoy the journey, and especially the friends made along the way. Will I find a purpose or direction? Perhaps. But I am sure as hell I wouldn’t have found them in my past life.’  
Another flight announcement echoed, this one for Denpasar. She gazed up, searching for the floating voice. Her hand instinctively grabbed her handbag.  
‘Time to go?’ I asked.  
‘Yeah. That one’s for me!’ she beamed. ‘Any last-minute airport-uncle advice?’  
‘Airport-uncle?’ I guffawed, ‘Let me think… Don’t give up agency over your life, especially out of fear. Any decision you take, even the worst ones, will always be better than the one you surrender to.’ I paused. ‘And more importantly, enjoy your trip.’",1,1768209000.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

Around the same time, I’d already been thinking about getting an AeroPress. I usually brew V60 at home, but I wanted to see how a brew using AeroPress actually tastes in comparison before buying one.

I went back today just to try the AeroPress. Asked for the same Blue Tokai beans and explained how I'd had the V60 earlier, so we could keep things as close as possible instead of changing too many variables.

It wasn’t a dramatic difference, but it was noticeable. Same coffee, different feel. Enough to make me pause and think about what I’d actually reach for on a regular morning. That was pretty much the reason I went back. I wasn't trying to decide anything that morning, just wanted a clearer sense of it beyond YouTube and Reddit threads. It helped.

1qaq52r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qaq52r/how_to_express_unpopular_opinions_without_getting/,How to Express Unpopular Opinions Without Getting DESTROYED: The Psychology Behind It,"Most people avoid saying what they actually think. They nod along, stay quiet, or sugarcoat everything into oblivion. I get it. I used to do the same thing. The fear of backlash, being misunderstood, or losing relationships kept me silent on topics I cared deeply about.

But here's what I learned after diving deep into communication research, psychology podcasts, and books on persuasion: staying silent doesn't protect you. It just makes you resentful. And when you finally DO speak up, you often do it badly because you never practiced.

The good news? There are actual techniques for sharing controversial views that reduce hostility and increase understanding. I've spent the past year studying this (books, YouTube deep dives, podcast binges) and testing these strategies in real conversations. Here's what actually works.

## understand the psychology first

Before you open your mouth, you need to grasp why people react so strongly to opinions that differ from theirs.

* **Confirmation bias is real.** Our brains are wired to seek information that confirms what we already believe. When you challenge someone's view, you're not just disagreeing with an idea. You're threatening their identity. Jonathan Haidt's book **""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion""** breaks this down brilliantly. Haidt is a social psychologist at NYU who spent decades studying moral psychology. This book changed how I approach difficult conversations entirely. The core insight? People don't form opinions through logic, they form them through emotion and then justify with logic. Insanely good read if you want to understand why debates get so heated.

* **Status threat matters more than truth.** Nobody wants to feel stupid or wrong in front of others. Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, talks about this in his masterclass and book **""Never Split the Difference""**. The techniques he used to negotiate with kidnappers work shockingly well in everyday disagreements. When you make someone feel heard before disagreeing, they're way less defensive. The ""tactical empathy"" concept alone is worth the read.

## timing and context are everything

* **Pick your battles.** Not every moment needs your hot take. Ask yourself: is this the right time, place, and audience? Dropping a controversial opinion at Thanksgiving dinner when everyone's had three drinks is different from a one on one coffee chat with a friend who's open minded.

* **Check your energy.** If you're angry, exhausted, or looking for a fight, wait. The podcast **""We Can Do Hard Things"" with Glennon Doyle** has an episode on ""arguing to win vs. arguing to connect"" that really stuck with me. When your goal is to WIN rather than to share perspective, you've already lost.

* **Start private, not public.** Social media amplifies everything. Testing out a controversial opinion with one trusted person first lets you refine your message before the masses tear it apart.

## how to actually say it

* **Lead with curiosity, not certainty.** Instead of ""You're wrong about X,"" try ""I've been thinking about X differently lately, curious what you think."" This isn't weakness. It's strategy. You're inviting dialogue instead of triggering defense mechanisms.

* **Use ""I"" statements.** Say ""I feel uncomfortable with this approach because..."" instead of ""This approach is terrible."" Ownership of your perspective makes it harder to attack.

* **Acknowledge the other side first.** This is straight from **""How to Win Friends and Influence People""** by Dale Carnegie. Yeah, it's old (1936), but it's a classic for a reason. Carnegie was a pioneer in interpersonal skills training. The book has sold 30 million copies because the principles work. When you show you understand the opposing view BEFORE stating yours, people are exponentially more receptive. ""I see why people believe X, and that makes sense given Y. Here's where I land differently...""

* **Separate the person from the idea.** Make it clear you're critiquing the concept, not attacking them personally. ""I respect you a lot, AND I see this situation through a different lens.""

## tools that help

* **The app Perspectives** (not super well known but worth it) helps you practice seeing issues from multiple angles before you voice your stance. It's like a gym for intellectual humility. You input a topic and it generates different viewpoints to consider.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts with adaptive learning plans. 

What makes it different is the hyper-personalization. You can tell its virtual coach Freedia about your specific struggles with communication or debate skills, and it'll pull from science-backed sources to create a tailored learning path just for you. You control the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context when something really resonates. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, I usually go with a calm, conversational tone that makes complex psychology concepts way easier to absorb during commutes. It actually covers all the books mentioned here plus way more, and the adaptive plan evolves as you learn. Worth checking out if you're serious about improving communication skills without the typical book summary fluff.

* **""Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most""** by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen. These authors are from Harvard Negotiation Project. The book gives you scripts for navigating high stakes conversations without imploding relationships. The ""Third Story"" framework they teach (stepping outside your perspective AND theirs to see the situation objectively) is a game changer.

* **ConversationSpace on YouTube** has videos breaking down real world examples of people handling disagreements well or terribly. Watching others mess up or succeed is educational as hell.

## manage the aftermath

* **Don't chase validation.** You said your piece. You don't need everyone to agree or even understand. Some people will think you're an idiot. That's fine. You're not responsible for managing their emotions.

* **Stay open to being wrong.** If you express an opinion and someone brings compelling counter evidence, be willing to shift. Flexibility isn't flip flopping, it's growth. The podcast **""You Are Not So Smart""** by David McRaney explores cognitive biases and why we cling to bad ideas. It'll humble you fast.

* **Set boundaries with bad faith actors.** Some people don't want dialogue, they want a punching bag. Recognize when someone's not engaging sincerely and walk away. Your mental health isn't worth a pointless argument.

## reality check

Expressing unpopular opinions is uncomfortable. It'll cost you some relationships, at least temporarily. But silence has a cost too. Resentment builds. You start feeling fake. And the opinions you never voice become heavier over time.

The goal isn't to be controversial for controversy's sake. It's to communicate your authentic thoughts in a way that preserves dignity, yours and theirs. Most people are terrible at this because they've never been taught. You can be different. These tools work if you actually use them. It takes practice, awkward moments, and some failures. But the alternative, living as a muted version of yourself, is worse.",2,1768208789.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

I’ve been thinking of starting a new business of a cafe here, around manning. Anyone here, would you think this is a great idea and would you come here? Most are a 15+ minute drive, especially to the south side.


It would be a cozy environment that’s modern yet has a feel of back home. The signature rugs, middle eastern music in the background, art hung up on the wall, etc.


The food would consist of sweets such as baklava, milk cakes (pistachio and caramel), cheesecakes (strawberry, chocolate, dubai chocolate, caramel), kunafa, fruit with chocolate drizzled, cookies (banana, chocolate chip), creamy mahalabia, zerde, and daheen. perhaps some kleicha served with the tea on the side (or a plate if needed). 

The drinks would be iced and hot beverages (caramel macchiatos, pistachio, chocolate), different types of tea but especially a large kettle of black tea (a favourite in iraq), arabic coffee, tamarind juice, jugs of lemon water with cucumber, and we’d want a special drink that’s displayed. Maybe a special tamarind or a qamar-al-din drink. 

I know it’s not easy since it’s a headache and a half, but i’m so determined to make it happen. My eyes light up when I think of making this a reality. Please give me tips and advice if you have any!! Thank you.",1,1768208660.0,cafe,0,1.0,False

Shortest prep time I have ever had but somehow it went really well. Here is what I did in those 2 hours.

First, I wrote out my self-introduction. I used to just walk through my resume which never left a strong impression. This time I tried something different. I have been slowly building up a bank of stories with tags like ""challenge"" or ""leadership"" from previous interviews. I wrote out three classic questions: why this company, why this role, and how would you describe yourself. Then I pulled three keywords from the job description, then structured my intro as ""I believe I have three qualities that fit this role"" and went through each one with a specific example. I also use chatgpt and beyz interview assistant to polish my answers.  Finally I filled in 1-3 stories underneath the questions as bullet points so I could pull from them during the interview.

During the interview I just had my outline and resume in front of me. They did not start with self-introduction, but those three qualifications I prepared basically became my answer for ""why you"" later. I went through all three points smoothly and I could tell the interviewer was impressed.Then they started asking about specific technical experiences from my resume. I used the examples under each qualification to tell stories. I am still not great at STAR format but I at least covered the situation, task, and action parts.They also asked about my favorite class in my program. I had talked about project finance in a coffee chat the day before, so I explained what made it challenging and how I handled it. 

 For why this company, I made sure to show I had actually researched the industry. I mentioned recent policy changes and how the company positions itself in the market. I also talked about the company culture and how it matched what I was looking for. For why this role, I combined it with why this company and my future career goals. I broke it into three points again which seemed to help the interviewer follow along. When they asked about time management, I talked about balancing six classes, a TA position, and an internship last semester. I showed that I stay organized with to-do lists, communicate early when I need extensions, prioritize tasks by importance, and focus on quality over just getting things done. At the end they asked what I like to do outside of work. I said I am someone who loves being outdoors. 

The best sign that it went well was that the interviewer started giving me tips for the next round. She told me they might ask about Power BI and suggested I brush up on it before talking to one of the managers who uses it a lot. Before we finished they said on the spot that I fit what they were looking for and would schedule follow-up interviews with two managers soon.",3,1768207883.0,interviews,2,1.0,False

I'm seeing a lot of posts at the moment where students are panicking about not having revised so well up until now, or thinking they've ruined their chances of doing well at GCSE. As a tutor, I've had many, many a new student come to me in January saying exactly the same thing. As such, here are some tips to help yopu on your way so that you can make the most of the next few months before exams. SPOILER: There's more than enough time to do as well as you'd like to if you're prepared to put the effort in.

  
Tips for improving your concentration:

1. If you would like to improve your grades, you need to be committed to that. Whilst I'm not against social media at all generally, I am very, very aware of how short-form videos (TikTok, Insta reels, etc) can impact students' ability to concentrate. Therefore, if you really are committed to working fairly hard, I recommend temporarily deleting Tiktok from your phone. This decision is entirely up to you. However, revision will be a lot harder if you don't do what you can to improve your concentration as your brain will be constantly fighting you to have a break or to have a look at your phone and \*just five more minutes\* of scrolling. Redownload tiktok in June by all means. But for now, it might be best to have a break.

2. Move a little every day. A lot of you will walk to school or have PE during the day. Otherwise, consider doing 5 minutes of stretching or walking at some point in the day, perhaps as part of a study break. Even a little movement can improve your focus and your sleep (which in turn improves your focus).

3. Sleep as well as you can. A lot of you will be stressed or anxious, which is totally understandable. As such, it may not always be possible to get the sleep you would ideally be getting. However, always try to give yourself the opportunity for 8 hours of rest. It makes far more difference to your ability to memorise information to get enough sleep than it does to revise an extra hour or two each night when you should be in bed. I realise this is annoying advice - you'll have busy days and not a whole lot of free time some days, and so when you're done working you just want some quiet time to do what you want or to go out with friends. But again, if you are serious about improving your grades, prioritising sleep may be a sacrifice that needs to be made.

  
Practical revision tips:

1. Never just sit and read notes and never believe yourself if you find yourself thinking 'yes that's just common sense, I'll definitely remember that in the exam'. Neither of these techniques will help you to remember all that you need to, but they can take a lot of time out of your day.

2. Have a clear focus to every revision session. Choose a specific topic (e.g. the perfect tense, osmosis, short term consequences of tsunamis in Indonesia) and then decide if your first goal is to UNDERSTAND, APPLY or MEMORISE the information

a) If you are aiming to 'understand', that means you may currently find the topic confusing or unclear. As such, spending time using class notes, your textbook and online resources to make new notes that present the information in a way you understand will be crucial to the learning process. During this stage, you can also make a list of any questions you have for your teacher, which you can go and ask them about at school.

b) if you are aiming to 'apply' the information, that means you undersand the topic and may or may not have already memorised the content. If you know you have not memorised the content, you may choose to use your notes to help you writye answers to example questions to practice presenting the information in a way that will get you marks. Use the mark schemes to mark your work and rewrite answers with any mistakes corrected and additional information added. 

If you have memorised the content, you may choose to do past paper questions without your notes and to then mark them to get a sense of how well you know the topic, and what work you need to do in the future to help yourself get more marks.

  
c) If you are aiming to memorise content, that means you already understand the topic fairly well and you are aiming to commit key details (key dates, Physics formuli, specific conjugations of verbs, quotes) to memory. You may choose to use flashcards (online or paper), mindmaps, blurting, or anything else to help with this. Everyone is different and so everyone has different methods. The key is that this will not work unless you put effort in, and as such your brain will likely fight against doing it on occasion, especially if you're tired or if you're not so keen on the subjct. As such, remembere that it's better to do 15 minutes of active revision that takes effort and energy than an hour of passive revision that does not take effort. Quality over quantity, do what you can do and don't panic about what you can't do. 

  
Otherwise

\- Work where you are comfortable... floor... desk, coffee shop, library... it doesn't matter. I'd be cautious about working from bed if you have a choice, as this can impact some people's ability to sleep if they associate bed with work. But it is your choice in the end.

\- Drink water, eat foods that support your mental and physical health.

\- Don't completely give up on seeing friends and doing fun things! You don't need to be giving 10 hours per day to revision, whatever people online seem to be doing. It can be nice to do the revision you can during the day and to reward yourself with time out with friends in the evening. In fact, doing this can help you reset ready for another day of work the next day. Remember: quality over quantity, better 2 hours or even 45 minutes of efficient revision on a given Saturday than 8 hours reading the textbook as if it were a novel.

  
There is still a lot of time before most GCSE exams. Do what you can and look after yourself through this period and there's no reason you shouldn't come on leaps and bounds. All is not lost just because you didn't start revising at the beginning of year 10!",2,1768207420.0,GCSE,0,1.0,False
1qaps2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/handpickedberlin/comments/1qaps2b/181_the_newsletter_is_baaack/,#181 - the newsletter is baaack,"Also, german startups are apparently “back”.   
Insolvencies at a 20-year high. **Both can be true.**

It makes me wonder about the correlation - hopefully the startups are the leading indicator?

anyways, new Handpicked Berlin issue is out atfer a two-week break, and it’s one of those weeks where the contrast is… loud

On one side: Germany had 17k corporate insolvencies in 2025: more than during the financial crisis (!). Manufacturing got hit hard, 170k jobs affected. Not great. (for sure a big China impact? and it will probably get worse before it can get better! or will it never get better?)

On the other side: startup activity is picking up again. New companies, new rounds, actual momentum. I’ve called the bottom before, and I’m sticking with it. At least in tech.

A few things that stood out while curating this one:

Berlin: Langdock crossed $15M ARR, GetYourGuide turned profitable and is exploring a secondary sale, Factory Berlin wants to incubate 800 AI startups (ambitious is one word). 

Career-wise, a Reddit survey showed 46% of hires still come from referrals and recruiters. Boring? Yes. True? Also yes. Networks still beat perfectly polished CVs.

Funding roundup:

Berlin:  
Vivanta – €2.5M Seed (digital property management)

Germany:  
CertHub – €6.2M (medtech compliance)  
United Manufacturing Hub (Cologne) – €5M Seed  
Mercura (Munich) – $2.1M Seed  
Pluvion (Freiburg) – €1M+ Seed

Plus: Burgermeister plans 30 new locations (i find it funny nobody complains about that the same way as for LAP Coffee), Berlin real estate prices are still… wild, and Markthalle Pfefferberg is finally back (hibiscus margaritas included).

1-Barthélémy was the terrible police chief appointed by the French. In cafes and gatherings, Egyptians called him 'Fart el-Roman'; they used this alias because uttering his real name was considered a provocation that might cause him to attack or oppress them.

End March I’m visiting family in HK and will do a week trip to Kyushu Japan. And obviously I’m looking into where I can get good coffee.

In HK we’re staying in Sheng Shui and typically like to go to Let it be, they tend to have very nice pour overs. I would love to try some good cups in central as well though. Also I’d like to bring some nice beans home as well. Especially some more bodied filter beans for my wife.

Also in Japan I would like to experience the pour over scene. Last time we were in Japan I wasn’t into pour over yet (3 years ago?) so didn’t drink much. Now I want to change that. Online it’s easy to find nice coffee places from Tokyo etc. But I’m unsure about Kyushu. I would like to try both prepared pour over and beans to take home.

Hope anyone can help 😀

(Avoid These Rookie Mistakes 😅)","# 

So you’ve finally landed in Spain. Sun shining, coffee in hand, life feels like a movie.  
Before you get *too* comfortable… here are a few classic newbie mistakes we’ve all made (yes, including me).

**1. Thinking “mañana” means tomorrow**  
It doesn’t. It means *not right now*. If someone says “mañana,” relax, it’ll happen… eventually. Breathe.

**2. Expecting shops to be open all day**  
You will, at some point, stand outside a closed shop at 3pm wondering if it’s a public holiday.  
It’s not. It’s just Spain. Siesta is real.

**3. Booking appointments without paperwork**  
Spain loves documents. Originals, copies, extra copies you didn’t know you needed.  
Pro tip: bring everything, even things you think are irrelevant. Somehow, they’re not.

**4. Assuming everyone speaks English**  
Many do, many don’t and that’s okay. A few words of Spanish go a long way.  
Even badly pronounced Spanish is better than none (bonus points for confidence).

**5. Underestimating Spanish bureaucracy**  
If you think you can “just pop in and sort it out”… think again.  
Appointments, stamps, waiting, more waiting and sometimes a surprise form at the end.

**6. Forgetting healthcare works differently here**  
Spain’s healthcare system is great, but it’s *not* like back home.  
Knowing how it works before you need it = future you will be very grateful.

**7. Thinking life will feel settled in a week**  
It won’t. And that’s normal. The first month can feel chaotic, confusing, and overwhelming.  
Then one day… it clicks. And you’ll wonder why you didn’t move sooner.

I spent 3 weeks building LocalLence  a tool that organizes TikTok travel videos by city and maps them on Google Maps.



Why I built it:



I was planning a Tokyo trip. Found 30 spots on TikTok. Screenshotted everything.



Got to Tokyo. Couldn't find half the screenshots. Missed the spots.



That broke me. So I built a tool to fix it.



The MVP:

\- Browse TikTok travel videos by city (Tokyo, Bangkok, Paris)

\- Filter by vibe (coffee shops, quiet spots, adventure)

\- Click location → Google Maps opens

\- Save spots → build itinerary



Tech stack:  React + Supabase + Google Maps API



Total cost: $0/month (free tiers)



Launch date: Jan 31, 2026



The problem:



I set up the waitlist 3 days ago.



Signups: 0.



(Okay, my roommate signed up. So... 1.)



What I've tried:

\- Posted on Reddit (r/solotravel) → 12 upvotes, 3 comments, 0 signups

\- Tweeted about it → 5 likes, 0 signups

\- DM'd 10 travel TikTok creators → 0 replies



What I'm doing wrong (I think):



1. Maybe the problem isn't painful enough?

2. Maybe my landing page sucks?

3. Maybe I'm solving a fake problem?

4. Maybe I should just launch NOW instead of building a waitlist?



My daily routine:

\- 6 AM: Code for 1 hour

\- 8 AM: Database Management class

\- 12 PM: Lunch + check Reddit/Discord

\- 1 PM: Python lab

\- 4 PM: Back to dorm, code until 2 AM

\- 2 AM: Sleep



Repeat.



Professors keep asking why I'm tired. I can't tell them I'm building a startup lol.



Questions for entrepreneurs:



1. Is this a real problem? Or am I solving something nobody cares about?

2. Should I pivot now? Or keep building and launching on Jan 31?

3. What would YOU do if you were at 0 signups 20 days before launch?



Be brutally honest.

Days 1-15: Wake at 6 AM daily (no snooze), 20-minute workout, cold shower, 10-minute journal, coffee, 60-minute deep work session.  
Days 16-30: Refine routine timing, add gratitude practice to journal, optimize breakfast prep, protect deep work time (no email/Slack).  
Days 31-45: Maintain consistency on weekends too, track productivity metrics (tasks completed), notice energy level improvements.  
Days 46-60: Perfect the system, document benefits, create backup plan for travel/disruptions, commit to 90-day extension.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Daily check-in photos — timestamped selfies at 6:05 AM showing wakeup time for all 60 days (can be compiled into video).
2. Workout app screenshots — Strava/Apple Fitness showing 60 morning workouts logged.
3. Journal entries — photos of handwritten journal (or digital screenshots) showing 60 daily entries.

They fired everyone and told them to reapply for their own jobs. It's backfiring spectacularly.,"My brother-in-law worked at a successful, privately-owned tech components firm. Really profitable place. Last Wednesday, they get called into an all-hands meeting and are told that, effective immediately, they're all terminated. The company had been bought out by a big investment group.



Apparently, the new owners structured the deal to acquire the assets, not the staff, so all the employees were just a liability to be shed. The kicker? They offered everyone the ""opportunity"" to reapply for their old jobs, but the new terms were a joke. The pay was cut, vacation days were slashed, and they basically combined two roles into one for each position.



Everyone was just stunned. You never think something like that is going to happen. But here's the thing: not a single person has bothered to reapply. The job market around here is actually pretty good, and people have options. The new owners sent in some HR guy from corporate who set up a little booth in the breakroom to take applications. He even brought a sad tray of bagels and some lukewarm coffee. Nobody went near it. The application forms are still sitting there in a neat pile.



The real headache for the new owners is this: the company makes a very specific, niche product. They run on proprietary software and custom hardware that the employees developed and maintained themselves in-house over the years. All that institutional knowledge just got up and walked out the door. The idea of them offshoring production or anything like that is a non-starter; the whole operation is unique.



The average tenure there was about 15 years, with a bunch of folks who had been there for over 30 years. Most of that older crew just took it as a sign and decided to retire on the spot. Even the department heads in engineering and finance are bailing.



As for my brother-in-law, he's already got two interviews lined up for better-paying jobs. He's actually looking forward to a real vacation for the first time in years. Honestly, watching this unfold from the sidelines, it's hard not to feel a little smug for both the old owner who cashed out and the new ones who completely miscalculated.

Between his travel vlogs, love for filming locations, retro items, and an eye for overlooked details, we were quick to subscribe.

Last year, I often caught up with Adam's vlogs during coffee breaks. In one episode, he visited Old Towne Orange, California - one of our favorite spots, searching for the original Orange Plaza Fountain. The fountain by City Hall was nice, but it wasn’t the original. The area has at least 3 of them! I had recently purchased a screen-printed T-shirt featuring the OG fountain at a little shop in the area.

I left a YouTube comment explaining that the original town fountain was now located by the Orange Library. A few days later, Adam returned with Tom Wilson, found the fountain at the library, and also visited the Huell Howser exhibit! I was thrilled to see that he was following up on the matter haha.

On another visit, he stopped into the shop in Old Towne Orange and bought the same fountain T-shirt I had, which made me smile whenever I saw him wearing it in a thumbnail.  
Here are a few videos featuring the tee but there's several more, I believe:

The shop where he bought the shirt is The Squeeze in Orange. They still sell it if you’d like to support a small business. I am not connected to them in any way but this random story will always make me smile.

I don’t know if trust can be rebuilt (32M, 32F, 30F)","My S/O of almost a decade cheated on me with a friend. And I don't know what's worse: the betrayal, or the years of empty promises?

For the purposes of this story, let’s call him Fred and the “friend” Becky - not their real names. I’ll also keep the details vague to avoid revealing anything too identifiable. For context, all involved are in their early-mid 30s.

Fred and I got together after a friends-with-benefits situation developed into feelings. We met in his country  and, with me heading back to my own country about a year on from that, we had agreed to the arrangement with the caveat that neither of us become attached to the other.

We were neighbors after all, then when we became friends, the whole thing was very convenient. Fast forward to today where we have now lived in another (third) country together for around 7 years.

 Of course, over the years Fred and I have talked a lot about our future - the party we’ll have to celebrate our marriage, the names we’ll give our future children, how we’ll decorate the beach house we one day hope to own, our families have even vacationed together.... All that’s missing is him popping the big question, a question which he has been promising to ask for about 3 years now. It’s always “coming” but hasn’t appeared.

 There’s so much backstory and nuance to this whole tale, but I’ll try and cut straight to the point.

This past March, we moved from one end of the country to another as I got a new job. Just before Christmas, my best friend (let’s call her Megan) back in the previous city we lived in revealed that she was pregnant but, for a range of reasons, was going through with it

Wanting to be there for her, we immediately booked the end of the week off work and hopped on long flight to be by her side fully expecting a quiet weekend supporting her through things.

 Megan likes to socialize, and surprisingly, after her medical procedure, a chilled night was not on her mind. Nope, we were going out! At this point it was kind of starting to feel a bit like it was her world and we were just living in it, we were exhausted from our 5am flight, but who are we to judge how people should or should deal with tough situations.

For context, Megan has been through a few tough situations in our 6 year friendship - she feels deeply but lacks self-awareness. She is, however, my soft spot. She can be 100% in the wrong and I will still fight her corner, no matter what – friend soulmates are a real thing.

 Anyway! The night goes on and it is truly great to spend time with Megan and many of our old friends who we hadn’t seen since we left back in March. Enter Becky.

She was introduced to us about 2 or 3 years ago through Megan. These two fall out and make up basically every other day. We — my partner and I — were, for a while, somewhat close with Becky, even looking after her cat when she goes on vacation, or going on a random 6h round roundtrip on a weeknight to fetch her things from her ex, taking her out to cheer her up when she was sad. I even didn’t take sides in her regular fallouts with Megan! After we moved away, we didn’t really keep in touch with Becky, aside from the odd message every few weeks.

The night goes on, drinks are flowing, and it’s gets to that time where people should head for home. Megan had already taken herself to the taxi rank and was soon to be followed by Becky. Fred accompanied her just to make sure the girls got on their way safely.

I’m left with an acquaintance (Paul, not his real name) who, after some time, points out how strange it is that Fred hasn’t returned.

He’s basically telling me to wake up and smell the coffee while I’m dismissing him, assuming there’s some delay with the taxis. It’s around this time that Paul suggests I might need better friends.

Eventually Paul and I go in search of Fred but can’t find him, Becky, or Megan. I’m trying to call all of them to ask what’s going on and nobody is answering me.

The next hour or so is honestly a blur but after getting ahold of Megan and asking what’s happening and where everyone is, I start to understand that something has happened between Fred and Becky. But when pressed, Megan tells me she’s “too tired to talk” and to “roll the tapes” (yes, like a reject from a trashy reality TV show) and says “why don’t you ask your man”…. Um, maybe because I’m asking you, my best friend?

At this point, I’m acutely aware that whatever they have done is not her responsibility, but I do feel that Megan could be… nicer to me?

I make my way back to the hotel and find Fred passed out, but alone  - thankfully. Panic over.

But Paul is like “nope. Something is 100% off here. Wake him up and ask him.” I do so and Fred apparently can’t remember anything, he claims he just walked Becky to the taxi that was it.

Becky eventually answers the phone and after much pressing from me and attempted diversions from her, I discover that yes, Fred and her at the very least kissed. 

And this is where it gets me, dear readers, because it seems so unserious. By the time you’re reading this, I’m now to understand that they “made out, twice” and that “hands wandered” — whatever that really means?!?! I know this betrayal isn’t an affair, and objectively speaking it’s not that *big* of a betrayal, is it, but it still really hurts.

After this revelation, Paul immediately had me pack my things and got me out of the hotel room. Took care of me until I could get in touch with close friends to stay with, he even checked up on me every day for about a week following.

 Megan, on the other hand, sent me 44 (yes, forty four) consecutive messages the following day, along with 6 missed calls. Not once did she ask if I was okay, her biggest concern was if we were still meeting for dinner that day.

Becky sent me several messages too, complaining about her hangover, hoping “this doesn’t ruin our friendship,” and generally just being completely off tune. 

When I eventually returned to my hotel room, I swear I could smell her perfume though Fred swears she wasn’t in our room. Does that mean they were all up on each other enough for it to linger on his clothes? Idk. But I spent the day in the dark literally crying and throwing up just thinking about it all.

So where does that leave me now? My s/o, well… he’s sorry. Still doesn’t remember much, and still can’t give me a “why.”

We had my parents stay with us for the holidays and, as messed up as it sounds, I made him pretend like everything was A-ok. He might have ruined my Christmas, but there was no way he was gonna ruin it for my folks too after they had traveled all that way.

We’re now post-holidays and really facing reality.

I’m staying in our spare room, attending therapy (as is he), and really want to work through this - if we can. The thing that gets me is all his empty promises went without action. What hurts most isn’t just the physical boundary crossing - it’s that after years of deferred commitment, the one decisive action he did take shattered my trust.

If you’re still reading this, thank you. I don’t know what I hope to achieve by posting here. Validation. Sympathy. Ideas on what to do next or how to heal from this. Anything at all, really!

It’s such a tangled web and feels so messy, but it’s hit me so hard and I really appreciate you taking the time to hear my story even if it doesn’t yet have a resolve.

I’m not looking for ‘leave him immediately’ comments - it’s too complex for that to help me right now. I’m trying to understand whether rebuilding trust is realistic here. I’m open to all perspectives, even hard truths.

**TL;DR:** My partner of nearly a decade crossed boundaries with a mutual friend on a drunken night out - making out and inappropriate touching. While it wasn’t full sex, it happened after years of broken promises about proposing and committing.

I’m struggling less with *what* happened and more with *what it represents*: delayed commitment, damaged trust, and the fact that the one decisive action he took ended up hurting me.

I got close to this girl from college. When it was just us, it felt intense. She’d ask about my day, my emotions, talk for hours, call randomly, share everything. It felt personal. It felt like I mattered. But the moment we were in a group, I basically disappeared. She’d be laughing, talking to other guys, and I’d just… exist there. I kept telling myself I was overthinking, but it hurt every single time.
One day we spent hours together in the evening, Coffee, mall, clothes shopping, jokes, just walking around. During all this, casually, she told me she’d spent the entire day with another guy she’s been hanging out with a lot lately. I just nodded and listened even though it felt like something was sinking in my chest. Later that night, during dinner, I finally said it , that I was attached to her. She calmly told me she doesn’t feel the same way and that she talks to many male friends like this. The silence after that was awful.
Then she posted a story with another guy. I don’t know why that hit me so hard, but it did. Way harder than I expected.
Few days later, I was venting to my ex (we are good friends but things didnt work out thus we broke up).  And then during that time, she admitted she cheated on me when we were together(which she had always wanted to clear to me bout) I swear that moment rewired my brain. Everything I thought I had with her suddenly felt fake.
So in the span of days, the girl I’d been emotionally leaning on didn’t want me the way I wanted her, and the one person I thought was a safe emotional place turned out to have betrayed me in the past. Both of them gone. Just like that.
After that, I started feeling weird everywhere. I just have to get this off my chest. Its like im good for comfort but not enough exclusivity.",1,1768206331.0,TeenIndia,2,1.0,False

1qaphfa,https://i.redd.it/2xvrlpzxovcg1.jpeg,Anyone know the title or where to read?,"It didn’t have a title and was £40 a week to subscribe 😱 noveilax was the title of the domain (but didn’t click to an app) 

For twelve years, I was the shame of the Silver Moon Pack. A Luna who never shifted, a barren wife who couldn't give Alpha Ivan an heir.

I thought my body was broken. But on my thirtieth birthday, I learned I wasn't sick. I was being murdered.

Tracking Ivan to a downtown gallery, I expected to catch him in a lie about work. Instead, I saw him playing father to a child that wasn't mine, while his mistress looked on with a smirk.

Then, I heard my own father’s voice booming through the thin glass.

""If that White Wolf blood of hers ever woke up, she'd destroy us all. Better she dies a sickly Omega.""

My husband, my Fated Mate, didn't defend me. He just checked his watch.

""She smells of death already. The Wolfsbane in her tea will finish her off during the fireworks tonight. Then we can finally replace the mule.""

My knees hit the floor. For five years, the ""medicine"" they forced down my throat wasn't a cure. It was poison designed to suppress my Supreme rank.

They didn't hate me because I was weak; they were killing me because I was stronger than all of them combined.

I drove back to the mansion, my sadness hardening into cold rage.

I poured the lethal tea down the sink and picked up the microphone for the Pack Gathering.

They were expecting a funeral tonight.

I was about to give them a public execution.

…

…

Aliana POV:

\*Thirty. That was the number of cracks in the plaster above the bed. It was also the age I turned today.\*

In our world, the first Shift \*usually hits like a freight train\* at eighteen. The pain of bones breaking and rearranging is supposed to be a rite of passage, a welcome into adulthood. But for me, that day came and went with nothing but a \*low-grade\* fever.

Twelve years later, I was still just Aliana. The Wolf-less Luna. The embarrassment of the Silver Moon Pack.

The heavy oak door creaked open. I sat up, pulling the silk sheets against my chest.

Alpha Ivan walked in. He was already dressed in his charcoal suit, \*looking like a million dollars and smelling like trouble.\*

He was my Fated Mate. The Moon Goddess had decreed it. But without my wolf, the bond felt one-sided. \*Like shouting into a canyon and waiting for an echo that never comes.\*

""Happy birthday, Aliana,"" he said. \*Tone flat. Professional.\*

He leaned down to kiss my cheek. I closed my eyes, desperate for the spark, the electric current that books said mates shared.

Instead, I felt nothing but \*damp skin.\*

And then, it hit me.

The Scent.

Usually, Ivan smelled of crisp pine and rain. But today, beneath the expensive cologne, there was something else.

\*Peaches. Rotting in the heat.\*

""You're leaving?"" I asked, my voice small. ""I thought... I thought we might go to the Moon Stone today. To pray for my wolf?""

Ivan straightened his tie in the mirror, not looking at me.

""Pack business, Aliana. The border negotiations with the Northern packs are intense. I can't hold their hands and pray to a silent Goddess.""

He turned, his eyes sweeping over me \*with the kind of look you give a dog that needs to be put down.\*

""Maybe if you focused less on fairy tales and more on your duties as a hostess, the Pack wouldn't be so restless.""

""I do my best, Ivan,"" I whispered.

""Your best isn't an heir, is it?"" he shot back.

He checked his watch. ""I'll be late tonight. Don't wait up.""

He walked out. The door clicked shut, leaving me in the silence of the massive, empty house.

My stomach churned. \*It wasn't just heartbreak. It was physical. For years, I'd been waking up dry-heaving, my joints aching like I was eighty instead of thirty.\* The Pack doctors said it was my body rejecting my dormant wolf.

I dragged myself out of bed. I needed coffee. I needed to feel like a person.

As I drove into town, my phone buzzed. It was Debi, my lawyer and the only friend I had left who didn't look at me like a charity case.

""Happy Birthday, Ali,"" her voice crackled over the car's Bluetooth.

""Thanks, Debi.""

""Let me guess. The Alpha is 'working'?""

""Border negotiations,"" I said, gripping the steering wheel.

""\*Bullshit,\*"" Debi said. ""\*I was at the courthouse filing permits this morning. The Northern delegates aren't even in the state until next week. Ivan isn't at the border.\*""

""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying you should go to his office. Surprise him.""

I hung up, my heart pounding a frantic rhythm against my ribs.

I drove to the Hughes Corporation tower. \*The security guards barely glanced at me. Why would they? I was the invisible wife.\*

When I reached the top floor, Ivan's secretary, a Beta female named Sarah, turned pale.

""Luna Aliana! We... we weren't expecting you.""

""Where is my husband, Sarah?"" I asked.

""He's... he's in a meeting. Off-site. Very private.""

Her eyes darted to the side. \*I caught the distinctive glaze over her eyes-she was Mind-Linking.\*

\*The Luna is here. She knows.\*

I saw a sticky note on her desk, half-covered by a file. \*Reese Gallery - 10 AM.\*

Reese.

The name sent a shiver down my spine. Kiera Reese. The Rogue who had tried to kill me five years ago. My parents swore she had been exiled to the Wastelands.

I turned on my heel and ran back to the elevator.

The Reese Gallery was in the arts district. I parked down the street, my hands shaking.

That's when I saw it. A black armored SUV with the crest of the Blood River Pack.

My father's car.

I got out, pulling my hood up. I crept toward the gallery's massive glass front.

The gallery was closed. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw them.

Ivan. My father. My mother, Luna Eleanor.

And Kiera.

She looked radiant. \*She didn't look like an exiled Rogue; she looked like she owned the place.\*

But it was what was happening in the center of the room that stopped my heart.

A little boy, maybe five years old, was running around a sculpture. He had Ivan's dark hair.

Ivan crouched down, opening his arms. The boy ran into them, giggling.

""Up! Up, Alpha Daddy!"" the boy squealed.

Ivan lifted him effortlessly. The look on Ivan's face... it was pure adoration.

I pressed closer to the glass. \*Adrenaline spiked through me, sharpening my senses in a way I hadn't felt in years.\*

""He's strong, Ivan,"" my father's voice boomed. ""A true Alpha heir.""

""He has your eyes, Richard,"" Kiera purred, linking her arm through Ivan's. ""And Ivan's strength.""

""When will you announce it?"" my mother asked, sipping champagne. ""We can't keep pretending Aliana is useful for much longer. The Pack needs a future.""

Ivan laughed. It was a cold, cruel sound.

""Tonight. After her pathetic little birthday dinner. I'll tell the elders that my sperm count is low, a tragic side effect of stress. We'll 'adopt' Leo. No one needs to know he's Kiera's.""

""And the girl?"" Kiera asked. ""She smells of death already. That Wolfsbane cocktail you've been feeding her is working slow, though.""

""Patience, my love,"" Ivan murmured.

""Five years of suppression,"" my father grunted. ""If that White Wolf blood of hers ever woke up, she'd destroy us all. Better she dies a sickly Omega than lives to take my territory.""

My knees gave out. I slid down the rough brick of the pillar.

\*They weren't just cheating. They were murdering me by inches.\*

Wolfsbane. The deadliest herb to our kind. They had been feeding it to me for five years.

I looked at my phone. A text message from Ivan popped up.

\*My dear, Pack business is dragging on. I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you tonight. Happy Birthday.\*

I looked through the glass. Ivan was kissing Kiera.

Something inside me snapped.

\*It felt like a rusty lock breaking deep in my gut.\*

\*Kill them.\*

The voice was ancient. Angry.

I scrambled back to my car. I drove.

As the gallery faded in the rearview mirror, my eyes caught my reflection.

For a split second, my irises weren't their usual hazel.

1qapfck,https://i.redd.it/gsri2zfylvcg1.jpeg,A cool guide to Flash Brew Iced Coffee vs Cold Brew — bright & fast vs smooth & slow (which do you prefer?),"I keep seeing “cold brew” used as a catch-all for any iced coffee, but **flash brew and cold brew are genuinely different** even though they’re both served cold.

**Flash brew (hot coffee brewed directly over ice):** brighter, more aromatic, “coffee-forward,” and you’re drinking it in minutes.  
**Cold brew (steeped cold for hours):** smoother, mellower, often *lower perceived acidity*, and easy to batch for the fridge.

A couple things I’m curious about (and would love to hear how you all do it):

* Do you prefer **bright/crisp** iced coffee, or **smooth/mellow**?
* If you’ve tried flash brew, do you tweak **grind finer** or just adjust the **ice ratio**?
* Anyone notice a big difference in how these taste with **milk** (or oat milk)?

*Note:* caffeine can vary a lot depending on ratio/grind/serving size—this is more about **brewing method + flavor profile** than “which is stronger.”

If people want it, I can drop a single link to a full iced-coffee recipe roundup (flash brew, cold brew concentrate, iced latte, etc.) in a comment—don’t want to clutter the post.",7,1768206008.0,coolguides,1,0.82,False
