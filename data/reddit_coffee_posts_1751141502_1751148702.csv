1lmyqe2,https://i.redd.it/mh0t18fhrq9f1.jpeg,Birthday haul,"Bf took me to ulta for my birthday today and we smelled tons of fragrances but honestly they all smelled the same to me after just a few sniffs‚Äî like a sharp, fruity headache hairspray. Even the coffee beans didn‚Äôt help and i was disappointed by the lack of range in the fragrances available; all the female were floral fruity and the men‚Äôs were all the same as well. Decided to  get a sample of crystal noir EDT and bright crystal EDT since bf liked the bright crystal absolu EDP on me and i figured they wouldn‚Äôt be too different. The bright crystal EDP was a bit strong for me anyway. I was also curious to smell crystal noir and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Then on the way out i saw the chlo√® line and it just exuded class and something unique with its packaging and notes. Even after smelling all of the perfumes, the Chlo√© original EDP and EDP lumineuse didn‚Äôt give off pure hair spray  from the first sniff and i could tell i liked them before even spraying them on my skin! I also got this body spray in old navy that smells really nice; heavy on the orange blossom. successful perfume haul. Sorry for the essay I‚Äôm just super happy 

Haven‚Äôt worn any on my skin yet or out but my ratings rn are: 
üå∫Versace bright crystal EDT: very very subtle scent, 7/10üíê flowery and sharp but only if you really sniff. Call me crazy but even gives some of VS love spell but classier and fresher; less of a fragrance cloud. Curious abt dry down 
üåòVersace crystal noir: also 7/10! Great date night fragrance and a fresh sexy which is (no pun intended) refreshing to see. Also a tiny bit smoky and boozy üç∏
ü™∑Chlo√® EDP: 8.5/10 i don‚Äôt normally go for pure florals but this is a woodsy floral that smells very crisp and DRY and expensive, like a wooden hut with tons of dried flowers hung up on the walls and an open basin of clean water in the center. Love love love 
üçØChlo√® lumineuse EDP: LOVE this one and am so glad i bought; think I‚Äôll prob end up buying full bottle of this and the original later on. Actually smells quiet different from the OG and is warmer, lusher, and fuller. Not a dry, crisp scent‚Äî very full bodied and feminine; 9/10. 
üçäOrange blossom and tea body spray: smells soooo nice and surprisingly good longevity and silage. Also gives me some tangerine notes. 9/10

1lmyqd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lmyqd5/aita_for_not_letting_my_mom_into_my_apartment/,AITA for not letting my mom into my apartment when her power went out during a heat wave,"Okay so I (24F) am working a summer festival this weekend meaning I work roughly 12 hour days that are very busy. My mom (60F) texted me around 10 am saying her power went out and it's really hot in the house (we are currently in the middle of a heat wave and it's roughly 90‚Å∞F with high humidity). I told her she doesn't have a key (I don't have the best relationship with her) and I didn't have time to give her one today. She kept begging and eventually I had to leave her on read and I've felt really guilty about it even though I'm pretty sure I was being perfectly reasonable. For full context I included a transcript of the text convo in this post. 




Mom: The power is out. Can I hang out at your apartment if it doesn't come on soon. Super hot


Me: Do you have a key? Also its pretty hot in my apartment even with the AC on so idk how much better it is lol. You might have more luck going to like the library or a coffee shop. 


Mom: I don't have a key but I'd rather hang out there than the library if I can


Me: idk how you'd get in without a key


Mom: can (insert GFs name here) let me in?


Me: shes working till 4 today


Mom: can I get a key from you or do you not want me there


Me: I'm running around a lot today idk when I could give you the key or how I'd get it back 


Mom: that makes me feel great


Mom, a few minutes later: please



At this point I just left her on read


For added context without getting too much into it"" when I moved out about two years ago she wouldn't let me take my mattress or my bed frame because ""she bought it for the room"" and I couldn't take the AC unit I had in my room because they were going to use it but it's literally been sitting in the corner of my old bedroom, uninstalled and unused for the last two years. I purposefully did not give her a key to my apartment because I knew otherwise she would drop in unannounced as she never gave me personal space when I lived with her. 

Anyways AITA?

I said something about not liking kids whilst we were conversing as i never have been fond of little kids majority of my life besides when i was one. She replied with ‚Äúwell then remember to keep your legs closed,‚Äù i don‚Äôt know if she thought this was funny or if she was purposely trying to be condescending or what. Cause every time she has said it in the past i immediately get defensive and more upset than anything else insulting I‚Äôve ever been told by her. My brother asked why she said that (because it made the atmosphere weird) and i replied why don‚Äôt you ever say that to my brothers and she replied ‚Äúbecause they cant get pregnant‚Äù ‚Äúit takes 2 to tango though‚Äù my brother replied which entices her to go on and on saying ‚ÄúYou can say no, im not ready yet‚Äù. which i don‚Äôt even know how to reply to this because she wants to speak on consent for me. Besides its a little too late since i am not a virgin and haven‚Äôt been for a long time now. Ever since I started dating my boyfriend shes been overbearing about the whole virginity purity gag and i knew it would be this way but I‚Äôm glad i made the sacrifice of dealing with it. Whenever i used to go to his house she‚Äôd say ‚Äúkeep those pants on‚Äù or she‚Äòd call me and scream at me to ‚Äústay pure‚Äù and rant about how she just ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to be a grandma yet‚Äù I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for a year now and her crash outs calmed down for just a while its on and off throughout the year that she has fits about me not being ‚Äòpure‚Äô along with when i got a UTI and she didn‚Äôt believe that it could be for any reason other than sex (and sure that‚Äôs probably how it happened but you‚Äôd tell a white lie here too. trust me). she‚Äôll walk into the living room while my boyfriend is over and say things to us about buying us chastity belts and don‚Äôt touch my daughter. Or she will sit down eat salad obnoxiously loud and stare at us so we cant be too close to one another.We cant just leave and go to my bedroom as expected we are not allowed and for the two days we were allowed she wouldn‚Äôt let us not sit straight up and id have to keep the brightest light possible on until she got sick of coming in every few minutes so hes not allowed anywhere near my room or she gets mad at me. shes calls me a wh*re in numerous ways including just plain out calling me a wh*re. and claims birth control would not be beneficial for me because that ‚Äúencourages sex‚Äù encourages the sex i am already having. she claims shes being protective of me but i think all shes doing is preventing me from the living and learning in the most uncomfortable unaccepting way possible.

I don‚Äôt honestly think i am the butthole in this situation but id like to see more on why others may think this way about their daughters. If there is anyway i can please her the way things are.

Because Ginsberg‚Äôs cry of loss  
has become a generation‚Äôs scream of rage.

*by Bryon Slack*

¬†  
I couldn't finish *Howl*‚Äî  
not because it wasn't correct  
but because I was already drowning in it.

The best minds of my generation?  
Stand stooped over, elbow deep in a grease trap  
Wearing a headset in a light tan cubicle  
or driving 50,000 pounds of steel west through Wyoming on I-80.

We've got Moloch, he just changed form to Ivy League handshakes  
asking for campaign contributions to finance think tanks to take over the Supreme Court.

I‚Äôve seen men wield scripture like cudgels,  
sermons that started soft‚Äî  
a drawl, a whisper, a hand on your shoulder‚Äî  
then rose like judgment through clenched teeth,  
their voices carving ravines into souls  
until we mistook erosion for grace.

I‚Äôve seen the other kind‚Äî  
wild-eyed, froth-lipped,  
rage made flesh before a congregation too stunned to breathe,  
tongues of fire flicking through pews  
faster than their mouths could catch up.

My sister always said,  
that they whispered that  
I was destined to be a preacher...  
Little did they know...

Little did they know...  
I‚Äôd stand before no pulpit,  
just a grease-slick floor and a dish pit choir,  
preaching the gospel of the overworked  
and the wrath of the underpaid.

My vestments?  
Stained apron, burn-scarred hands.  
My communion?  
Bitter coffee and the silence before a double shift.

I baptize in protest,  
anoint with calluses,  
and I do not forgive the sins of the powerful.

I put on the armor of knowledge  
tempered by Truth,  
ordained by God to strike  
the wicked I see before me.

And the fiery barbs  
dipped in Harvard deceit  
will shatter on  
a shield of righteousness.

I reach for the sword‚Äî  
not forged in flame,  
but of it.  
A blade of judgment  
beaten from Truth  
and tempered in fury.

Its hilt carved from silence,  
its edge honed on every  
""be grateful,""  
every ""keep your head down,""  
every boot pressing neck.

I swing not in hatred‚Äî  
but in reckoning.  
Not in vengeance‚Äî  
but in clarity.

And when it falls,  
it severs the veil  
between the sermons we were fed  
and the justice we were denied.

This is not wrath.  
This is the roar of a people  
who‚Äôve run out of cheeks to turn,  
who know now that  
peace is not the absence of conflict‚Äî  
but the presence of justice.

But before we swing the blade‚Äî  
you must speak the names it craves...

I mean‚Äîhow do you even explain it?  
That a memo. Just a simple memo‚Äî  
not a riot, not a speech, not a revolution‚Äî  
that a memo  
was the matchstick.

Typed on a Tuesday.  
Passed through hands  
like it wasn‚Äôt poison.

No blood on the page.  
Just ink.  
Just‚Ä¶ suggestions.  
Recommendations.  
Charts.  
Graphs.

How to reclaim the country‚Äî  
from us.

Not in the streets.  
Not in the courts.  
In the boardrooms.

They said:  
don‚Äôt fight the protest‚Äîown the narrative.  
Fund the think tanks.  
Buy the scholars.  
Rewrite the textbooks before they hit the shelves.

You want power?  
Build it brick by brick,  
beneath their notice,  
until it‚Äôs too late to burn down.

Lewis Powell wrote a battle plan  
in the comfort of corporate war rooms‚Äî  
before he ever wore the robe.  
Said the free market was under siege,  
that campus radicals had too many books,  
that the poor had too many questions,  
that workers had too much voice.

He called it strategy.  
I call it scripture for oligarchs.  
A quiet gospel of control  
passed from boardroom to bench  
until every gavel echoed like a closing door.

Truth didn‚Äôt walk this far  
to whisper anymore.  
She‚Äôs barefoot in the courtroom,  
blood on her hem,  
screaming precedent  
into every lawman‚Äôs face.

Radiant in her fury,  
for every sly  
diminishment  
in every classroom  
and on the evening news.

She doomscrolled through the headlines  
into the gig-shift gospel,  
where sermons are streamed  
in delivery bags.

Uber apostles drive Amazon martyrs,  
Grubhub saints weeping DoorDash psalms‚Äî  
to visit GoFundMe preachers,  
scraping for this month‚Äôs insulin  
in the shadow of a payday lender.

¬†  
¬†  
And still,  
we are told to wait.  
To shrink.  
To swallow.  
To kneel.

But Truth is done whispering.  
And so are we.

This is not a plea.  
This is not a prayer.  
This is not a *Howl* anymore.

This‚Äî  
is a *Roar*.

The storyteller walked on stage in no rush. The lights didn‚Äôt dim dramatically, and there was no musical cue. Just the sound of old leather groaning as he reclined into a very comfortable chair‚Äîpossibly the only piece of furniture in history to have both lumbar support and literary ambition.

He cleared his throat with theatrical precision and, with one hand lazily tossing a peanut into the air and catching it in his mouth, began.

‚ÄúOnce upon a time, in a village, not far from Hope‚Äî‚Äù

Wait.

Let‚Äôs pause here.

Hey.

Yes, *you*. The one reading this. What? Surprised I noticed you? Who else do you think I‚Äôm talking to? You think this is just between you and the glowing box you're staring into like it‚Äôs going to wink at you? Nah, pal. You're in here with me now. Don‚Äôt look behind you. There‚Äôs no one there. No narrator on a stool in your room, sipping tea. Just me. Inside the story. Inside *your* head.

This isn‚Äôt crossing the fourth wall. We left that wall behind two paragraphs ago. That wall is a smoldering pile of plaster and reader expectations. This is the fifth wall. The existential, reader-involved, metafictional, brain-melded, you-can‚Äôt-leave-now wall. Congratulations. You‚Äôre in the story. And I see you scratching. Yes. That itch. Might want to get that checked out. Or at least stop reading in your underwear.

Anyway.

Where were we?

Ah yes. ‚ÄúOnce a one-eyed-purple-people-eater fell from a ship.‚Äù

What?

Too silly?

You think that line‚Äôs clich√©? You think it's a joke? Well, maybe it is. Maybe it isn‚Äôt. Maybe the purple creature represents your fear of absurdity in an ordered world. Maybe it‚Äôs just something fun to say out loud. Try it. Go on. Say it.

...

No? Still scratching?

Fine. Let‚Äôs try again.

‚ÄúOnce, a reader had too many opinions, and they blew up. The end.‚Äù

Now *that‚Äôs* a story. Tight. Concise. Explosive. Do you like that one better? Did it tickle your literary fancy, or are you about to leave me a comment that starts with ‚ÄúAs someone who reads a lot of Neil Gaiman...‚Äù and ends with ‚Äú...I just feel like it could‚Äôve been better‚Äù?

Don‚Äôt worry. I won‚Äôt judge. Much.

You know what? Let‚Äôs do something radical. I‚Äôll give you a choice. That‚Äôs right. A real one. Because you‚Äôre part of this now. You and me. We‚Äôre a team. For better or worse. Like an awkward sitcom duo.

Choose your path:  
A) A story about **existential threats, dragons, and love**  
B) A story about **whining readers** who think things like *‚ÄúMy snail could write better than that, asleep‚Äù* or *‚ÄúMy butt itches.‚Äù*

You know what? Let's do both. This isn't a democracy. It's a story, and I run the narrative dictatorship around here.

**A: Dragons, Existential Threats, and Love**

The world was ending.

Again.

It had ended once before when humans invented reality TV, and again when they stopped reading books that didn‚Äôt involve emotionally stunted vampires. But this time it was serious. This time, the dragons had come back.

They weren‚Äôt angry. Just *disappointed*.

""Really?"" asked Gralnaxor the Infinite, curling around the Statue of Liberty like a scaly boa constrictor with a PhD in Judgmental Philosophy. ""You traded poetry for TikTok dance challenges?""

Somewhere in Ohio, a girl named Lizzy stared at the sky and felt... something. A tug. Like gravity had changed its mind. The dragons called it the Echo‚Äîa force older than narrative, one that sought connection through chaos. She was chosen, of course. Aren‚Äôt they always?

Chosen for what?  
To bring back meaning.  
To kiss a dragon?  
To save the world?  
To die heroically while holding hands with a misunderstood monster who just needed therapy?

Yes. All of it. And none.

Lizzy‚Äôs first line in the story was, ‚ÄúOh no, not again,‚Äù which she‚Äôd also said last week when she accidentally microwaved a spoon. This time, she was holding a glowing scale that had appeared in her cereal box instead of a plastic decoder ring.

Back to Gralnaxor.

He watched Lizzy from space. Literally. His left eye poked through the clouds, his pupil a galaxy in itself. His heart had been broken by civilizations before. But this human girl had potential. Maybe she could change things.

And maybe, just maybe, she could teach him what ‚ÄúAloha‚Äù really meant.

**B: Whining Readers and Author Rage**

Listen.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking. ‚ÄúThis guy just mashed two genres together and called it clever.‚Äù But I see you. Your browser has six tabs open. One of them is for work, one‚Äôs a shopping cart with pants you‚Äôll never buy, and one is some obscure Reddit thread where people debate the lore inconsistencies in a show about talking squid cops.

You don‚Äôt want literature.  
You want fireworks.  
You want dragons that sigh poetically.  
You want romantic leads who fall in love between commercial breaks and save the multiverse in time for brunch.

Well, tough.

This isn‚Äôt a vending machine for tropes. This is storytelling *with teeth*. Or at least loose gums and a coffee habit.

But since you‚Äôre still here‚Äîscratching and judging‚ÄîI‚Äôll leave you with a thought.

What if this whole thing was a setup?

What if *you‚Äôre* the story?

What if right now, in a future classroom, your great-great-great-great-grandchild is reading this text aloud, trying to understand what kind of species you were? And the class bursts into laughter when they get to the line:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scratch your butt. This isn‚Äôt Night at the Opera.‚Äù

What if this whole thing was immortal? Not because it was brilliant, but because you *read it*?

Because once you read something, it exists in you. Like glitter. Or regret.

The storyteller leaned back in his chair, smirking.

""And that, dear reader... is how we break the fifth wall.""

He closed the book.

The stage lights didn‚Äôt dim.  
The curtains didn‚Äôt fall.

He just pointed at you.

Below is an abridged version of the results of my 7-day medically supervised fast, and the benchmarks on things 6 weeks after its completion. I didn‚Äôt track as many things as I‚Äôd hoped, or quite as diligently, but I hope some of you find the results interesting and maybe even helpful in your journey.

Not a huge difference in looks from before I began to 6 weeks later. You can tell I‚Äôm a bit depleted in the fasted photo, but no surprise there. Attached you‚Äôll also see my daily tracking sheet from the week of fasting.

**InBody (body-fat/muscle mass):**

I was very pleased with the results here. My biggest concern from doing the fast, and especially since I didn‚Äôt do any exercise *at all* while fasting, was that I‚Äôd lose muscle mass. Obviously, in the immediate aftermath I lost a large chunk, but I understood that it was mostly water. As you can see from the reading 6 weeks post-fast, I gained it all back plus a little extra. I was following what is a regular lifting routine for me, and not doing anything too terribly soul-crushing, so this level of recovery was a little surprising for me and I was very, very happy with it..¬†

The one thing that has me a little miffed is the weight that was reported on that last reading: it‚Äôs almost 5 lbs lower than the weight shown on my Withings scale from roughly 30 minutes prior. I should have asked for another reading when I was in the doctor‚Äôs office, but it was early, and I was in a rush to see the results and get out to a much needed coffee.

**Strength:**

I was also pleasantly surprised here. 6 weeks post-fast, everything went up from my measurements pre-fast. The strength test immediately after fast was laughable. No surprise there.

My (somewhat arbitrarily) chosen tests were:¬†

1. Max reps barbell deadlift @ 315 lbs
2. Max reps machine bench pres @ 250 lbs

|Max Deadlift @ 315 lbs|8|3|10|
|Max Bench Machine @ 250 lbs|10|3|11|

**Blood Metrics:**

Most things got marginally better. I am almost definitely gonna die from some kind of heart trouble (damn you genetics!), so the Lp(a) coming down, even just a small amount, was a big win for me. I will be curious to see what future blood tests look like, though if I‚Äôm honest I haven‚Äôt been super on top of my diet since the end of the fast, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some of the metrics slipped in the wrong direction.

Okay that's it for now... I‚Äôm still thinking of putting more of the data and journal entries into a blog form of some kind, and if I do, will post a link up in here.¬†

Hope to do another fast sometime in the future, but I imagine I‚Äôll give it a year or more before I do.",1,1751147749.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

She also insists she needs to eat them in very careful moderation from now on. This usually happens directly after she's eaten a full 900ml tub of ice cream, a full can of Pringles or a whole cake she baked for herself (not sliced, a whole cake). Any food she eats needs to be fried, salads she eats have to be drowning in dressing and her primary source of water comes from very sugary tea and coffee, aside from a 500ml bottle of water she'll drink once a day (again, she insists 500ml of water is way too much for one human to consume).

She continues to insist vegetables are the main source of her stomach and gas troubles. I asked her earlier if it could be her overall diet but she says older women begin to get digestion issues and I wouldn't understand as a younger person (20s)... as she consumes a full tub of ice cream. I fully understand that it does change as you get older but you get the contradiction here.

Am I wrong to assume vegetables are healthier for older women than sugar and fried foods? How would I go about helping her eat healthier?

1lmyfk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologystudents/comments/1ll5rii/psychology_students_you_dont_have_to_work_in,What You Can Do with BA/BS in Psychology,"Last time I wrote a post saying that you do not have to go into mental health or healthcare related careers, after learning Psychology. I think many fellow previous Psychology students agreed in the comments. 

However I noticed that there were many current students wondering what specific job titles can Psychology students apply to. So I decided to write this follow up post to answer that question. 

Before I even list all jobs, students have to know one thing: for many employers, they are looking for a general Bachelor‚Äôs degree, regardless of specific major in mind. So really, there are many many jobs out there that Psychology students consider themselvrs unqualified for, when in truth they are. So keep that in mind.
Also I would like to qualify my advice that this is more applicable to students in the US/Canada. 

Anyways, some careers that come into my mind:

- Sales and Marketing
    - If you were interested in learning different decision making theories then this would be the field for you to try applying or witnessing those techniques with real stakes. Consider complementing your degree with different networks of people. 
- HR (Payroll, Recruiting, Training, etc.)
    - If you enjoyed organizational behaviour courses then this is for you. How do you identify people who will thrive in an organization? How do you reward people correctly? How do you foster a positive work culture? Consider complementing your degree with some elective courses from Business. 
- Data Analysis/Data Science
    - If you were interested in Psychometrics, Research Methods, Statistics, this is where you can play with real life data and have real life impacts. How do you measure something? How do you set up a test to collect the right data? What kind of analysis is best to reveal the relationship between the variables? Complement your degree with Statistics electives and programming languages like SQL, R, Python. 
- UX/UI
    - If you enjoyed Cognitive Psychology, Human Computer Interaction, etc. this is for you. How do you model behaviour? How does human brain perceive and interact with the external stimuli? Complement your degree by learning tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Canva, and Figma. 
- Law
    - If you enjoyed Philosophy of Psychology or hashing what research paper actually means or writing a logical, convincing papers this is for you. All the readings and writings you did built foundating for training in law. Make sure to get good GPA and study LSAT to be eligible for a law school. 
- Communications/PR/Advertisement
    - If you enjoyed learning how information is perceived and remembered this is for you. How do you effectively relay information within an organization? How do you priortize information? How do you avoid miscommunication? Complement your degree with graphic design skills and writing skills.

This list is in no way a comprehensive list. But you can see how you can leverage your education and how to go about aligning yourself closer to different industries. For best information, connect directly with those in the industry and talk over a coffee. 

Please, don‚Äôt waste your summers just travelling or partying; you can still do that while preparing for your career. Try to get internships, part-time, or contract jobs. Best if it‚Äôs in the fields that you are interested in, but really any formal job experience is good. You can still travel or party on your vacation or after work. Study hard to show people that you are a good learner. Participate in events inside and outside your school to connect with like-minded people. If you think you fall short on some skills and your courses don‚Äôt cover it, work on it on your own. Create a side project to showcase your learning. 

I hope this helps lots of students who are not sure what they want to do with all the fun things they learned during school!",3,1751147648.0,psychologystudents,0,1.0,False

Night 19 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThey Drank It‚Äù

(First-Person, Mason‚Äôs Voice)


---

Before Shift ‚Äì 8:16 PM

When I showed up, Rico was microwaving a burrito and watching TikToks on his phone at half volume. Business as usual. Normal. Safe.

> ‚ÄúYo, you clocking in early again?‚Äù he asked, stretching behind the counter.



‚ÄúNot yet. Just hanging out.‚Äù

He raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt mind third shift?‚Äù

‚ÄúPays better,‚Äù I said, which was only half a lie.

Rico grabbed a Sharpie and started scribbling on a sticky note. I caught a glimpse:

‚ÄúCount drawer @ 9:45 or manager flips again.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs been weird lately,‚Äù Rico mumbled. ‚ÄúHe was whispering with someone from corporate yesterday‚Äîtalking about some new rule you found? Sounded serious. Didn‚Äôt think anything actually happened overnight, but he was sweating like a hostage.‚Äù



I said nothing. Just nodded and opened my lunch. Leftover fried rice, a boiled egg, and a plastic-wrapped coconut mochi I‚Äôd picked up from a store across town.

I left the mochi on the counter with a fresh note for Lila:

> ‚ÄúThanks for warning me. Hope this one‚Äôs sweet enough.‚Äù



Rico left right on time‚Äî9:47 PM, like always. He didn‚Äôt wait for me to take over. Nobody does. They all make sure they‚Äôre long gone before the shift change.

Because even if they don‚Äôt know the rules, something in their bones says they shouldn‚Äôt stick around to find out.


---

During Shift ‚Äì 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM

At 10:01, the lights dimmed‚Äînot from power failure, but like the store was drawing a curtain over the real world.

The air got heavier. The shadows stretched longer.

Third shift had begun.


---

10:43 PM ‚Äì The Crying Baby

The crying started behind the break room door.

Soft at first. Then louder. Wailing. Gurgling. Wrong.

The kind of crying that‚Äôs meant to be heard.
To trick you. To draw you in.

I froze.

Weeks ago, I‚Äôd found a hand-written rule tucked under the freezer shelf:

> ""IF YOU HEAR A BABY CRYING, IT‚ÄôS NOT A BABY. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR.""
‚ÄîK



I stayed rooted to the tile, every hair on my arms standing on end. The sound stopped. Silence.

Then‚Äîtwo slow scratches from the inside of the door.

That‚Äôs all.


---

12:11 AM ‚Äì The Red Slurpee

The Slurpee machine screamed.

Thick red syrup began oozing out of the cherry nozzle. Not soda syrup‚Äîsomething thicker, like congealed blood.

I threw the ‚ÄúOUT OF ORDER‚Äù sign on it and yanked out the red-labeled bucket from under the sink.

I started cycling it‚Äîbucket one. Two. Three. Four.

As I dumped the last batch, the door chimed.

Five people entered at once. Dressed like normal customers. Hoodies, jeans, blank stares.

They didn‚Äôt talk.

One of them headed straight to the Slurpee machine, ignoring the sign. Poured a full cup. Drank it.

Then another did.

Then a third.

> Rule Two: ‚ÄúIf anyone drinks the red Slurpee, offer them anything to keep them in the store.‚Äù



I scrambled. Grabbed anything:
Jerky. Phone cards. Lottery tickets. Vape pens. Sugar cookies.

> ‚ÄúFree. All of it. Stay here, alright? Don‚Äôt leave.‚Äù



They stared at me like they didn‚Äôt understand English. Then slowly began pocketing the items.

One crouched in the corner and started talking to the gum rack.


---

12:17 AM ‚Äì Black Phone

I ran to the back. Grabbed the black phone.

Dialed: 10711 + store number.
Said: ‚ÄúRed Slurpee.‚Äù

A new voice this time. Flat. Emotionless.

> ‚ÄúHow many drank?‚Äù



‚ÄúThree.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúAnyone watching from outside?‚Äù



I paused. Looked toward the lot.

A woman in a fur coat stood at the far edge of the parking lot. Same one from before. Not moving. Not blinking.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúContain them. Do not let her enter. Backup dispatched.‚Äù



The line went dead.


---

12:23 AM ‚Äì Lila Appears

Lila materialized behind the register. Pale dress. No footsteps.

She didn‚Äôt reach for the mochi. Not yet.

Instead, she said:

> ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt like her. The one in the coat.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou mean the thing outside?‚Äù

She nodded.

> ‚ÄúShe remembers me.‚Äù



Then she looked toward the mirrors.

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let him near the reflection.‚Äù



I turned‚Äîand saw one of the red Slurpee group frozen in front of the sunglasses display, staring at himself. His mouth moved, but the reflection‚Äôs didn‚Äôt.

I yanked the entire rack down and shoved it under the counter.

The reflection kept staring.


---

2:03 AM ‚Äì Extraction

Two black-clad figures entered. No words. No faces. Just gloved hands and silent gestures.

They led the group out one by one. Like puppets. The last one‚Äîthe mirror one‚Äîturned before leaving and smiled:

> ‚ÄúWe look alike now.‚Äù



And he was gone.


---

After Shift ‚Äì 6:02 AM

The store brightened. The tension broke.

The crying didn‚Äôt return. The Slurpee machine was dry. Lila‚Äôs mochi was gone, but the wrapper was folded neatly like origami.

The morning manager walked in, eye bags purple, coffee in hand.

I told him: ‚ÄúIt happened again.‚Äù

He looked like he might cry. Instead, he handed me a sealed envelope.

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open it. Not unless the Slurpee turns black. Then you‚Äôll need it.‚Äù



I nodded.

He paused at the counter. Whispered:

> ‚ÄúI heard what they said last night. About you.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd they say?‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThat you‚Äôre learning too fast.‚Äù



Then he walked away.

1lmyf01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lmyf01/the_el_paso_adventures_chapter_4_utep/,The El Paso Adventures: Chapter 4- UTEP Explorations and Experiences,"Ela and Tanya, jet-lagged but excited, had finally arrived at Rosa's Airbnb on Franklin Ridge Drive. The house was cozy and filled with the comforting sounds of a family. Rosa, a warm and welcoming woman with bright eyes and a ready smile, showed them to their room ‚Äì a shared space with a queen-sized bed for Ela and a twin for Tanya. Collapsing into their respective beds, exhaustion claimed them quickly. They were asleep by 9 PM, the promise of exploring El Paso humming in their dreams.

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the window. Ela stretched and then, predictably, sneezed. ""Ugh, I always sneeze first thing,"" she groaned good-naturedly. ""Sorry, Tanya. The room might stink of my sneeze.""

Tanya, ever the pragmatist, waved a hand. ""Don't worry about it. I can handle it.""

Ela was right, though. A peculiar aroma filled the air: a strange mix of honey and morning breath. Tanya grimaced slightly and opened the window, letting in the fresh desert air.

After showering in the shared bathroom and dressing, they were treated to a hearty breakfast prepared by Rosa: breakfast tacos overflowing with huevos y frijoles. Tanya savored the tacos with a cup of strong coffee, while Ela stuck to water, confessing she wasn‚Äôt a coffee drinker.

Rosa, true to her offer, piled them into her van. ""Call me when you're ready to leave,"" she instructed as she dropped them off at UTEP. ""Have fun exploring!""

UTEP and Downtown were the focus. First, UTEP. Ela and Tanya were determined to see every building on campus. They began at Hudspeth Hall, riding every elevator they could find.

""American elevators are so much bigger and nicer,"" Ela observed, a genuine appreciation in her voice. Tanya wholeheartedly agreed.

As they wandered the campus, they stumbled upon a series of bizarre, AI-generated stories plastered on notice boards. ""Bobby and the Milkshake Sneeze"" was a particular favorite, followed by the equally odd tale of an irate Prosper customer hurling rocks at a gas station. They chuckled at the absurdity.

At the UGLC, they overheard a professor passionately lecturing about psychology and the law. Intrigued, they slipped into the back of the lecture hall. They learned about the nuances of psychology within the El Paso context. Ela leaned over to Tanya and whispered, ""UTEP gives off strong high school vibes.""

Tanya nodded. ""It does. The University of Staffordshire felt more like a traditional university, you know, more spread out and less..."" She searched for the right word. ""...intimate.""

Just then, Tanya sneezed. Not subtly.

The professor paused and, microphone amplified, said, ""Bless you.""

All eyes turned to Tanya. She flushed and realized she couldn‚Äôt sneeze too loud in public.

Edgar, a student in the front row began sniffing audibly. He looked like he wanted to leave the classroom.

""Let's go,"" Tanya muttered, nudging Ela towards the exit.

Next, they ventured to the Student Union for lunch, opting for Pizza Hut. Ordering proved a little challenging, as the employee's English was limited. Ela, fluent in Spanish, stepped in, gracefully navigating the order. However, finding a place to sit was a different challenge. Every table was occupied. They ended up eating their pizza in one of the practice rooms in the Fox Fine Arts building, serenaded by the lively sounds of trumpet and drum practice from a musician named Jarvis.

Afterward, they sought refuge in the library, settling on the quiet fifth floor. Silence reigned, broken only by the occasional rustle of pages. Then, disaster struck. Ela sneezed. A loud, booming sneeze that echoed through the room, accompanied by the unfortunate expulsion of a small amount of saliva.

The librarian, a stern woman with tightly wound bun, approached them, her voice a disapproving whisper. ""The rule here is that all sneezes must be stifled, so that the area does not smell.""

Ela gaped, taken aback. ""Stifled? To avoid the smell?""

Tanya, stifling a giggle, steered Ela away. ""Let's just go,"" she said, shaking her head.

They continued their exploration of UTEP, meandering through the nursing building, admiring the architecture of Bell Hall, and noting the imposing presence of the Administration building. They paused outside Prospect Hall and then the Psychology department, marveling at a poster featuring a faculty member named Mr. Alvarez.

Finally, tired but satisfied with their UTEP adventure, they hopped on the Brio bus and headed downtown, eager to discover what the heart of El Paso had to offer.

I guess my question is do I cancel the 2nd date we had planned and just tell her ‚Äúhey i feel like i was more into this than you were, which is okay, but i‚Äôm going to take a step back.

Basically, it‚Äôs about imagining really short, specific little fantasies, like 10 to 30 seconds long, just to shift your focus or snap out of a bad spiral. Some people say it helps with anxiety or overthinking, but others use it as a way to deal with urges, especially around stuff like food, self-soothing, or even addiction.

I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot during one of my late-night mind-racing sessions. I was sitting on my bed, completely restless, not really in the mood to meditate or journal. So I closed my eyes and imagined something super random: me walking into a tiny used bookstore in a rainy city, buying a worn-out poetry book, and sitting down in the corner to read with a coffee. That‚Äôs it. Just that little scene. It only lasted maybe 20 seconds in my head, but it was weirdly calming. I didn‚Äôt even realize how tense I was until I finished imagining it and my body kind of relaxed.

Since then, I‚Äôve done it maybe three or four more times, usually when I feel like I‚Äôm spiraling or about to start doomscrolling. It‚Äôs not life-changing or anything, but it does shift something in the moment, like pressing a reset button on my brain.

I‚Äôm 25, based in the EU, and I‚Äôm on the hunt for some laid-back gamer pals who aren‚Äôt allergic to fun or basic human decency. If you‚Äôre into chill co-op nights, dumb jokes, and maybe even the occasional deep 3am conversation about life, the universe, and why creepers are the worst roommates, we‚Äôll probably get along great.

Games I vibe with regularly:
- Sea of Thieves
- 7 Days to Die
- Raft
- Minecraft
- Stardew Valley (because pixel farming is therapy)
- Phasmophobia (I scream, you scream)
- Crusader Kings 3 (100% of my heirs die mysteriously.. don‚Äôt ask)
‚Ä¶and a lot more!

I usually hop on around 5‚Äì6pm CET after work, and game until I start nodding off mid-loot. My schedule‚Äôs pretty consistent, weekdays are for chill, weekends can get a little wild (or productive, depending on caffeine levels).

I‚Äôm not into toxicity, drama, politics, or religion debates. Life‚Äôs too short for flame wars. That said, I‚Äôm very open to deep, meaningful convos, about anything from personal growth to ‚Äúwhat even is reality, man?‚Äù
Also, I‚Äôm trying to find a genuine connection, not just people to fill a squad. If we click, awesome, I‚Äôd love to build a small circle of friends who game together often and just have a good time.

Outside of gaming I‚Äôm into weightlifting, drinking more coffee than legally recommended, and living off a steady diet of White Monster like it‚Äôs holy water. If you also treat energy drinks like a personality trait, we‚Äôll get along just fine.

Preferably EU timezone, just to make timing easy, but if you‚Äôre flexible and the vibe is right, I don‚Äôt mind where you‚Äôre from.

quick note:  I have changed our alters names per their request

Chapter 1: The woods 



As she wanders in the woods, she sees a brilliant light beaming down from a small, decaying tree, the tree not higher than 2 feet, calling to her as if it were drawing her in. ""Come, darling, come closer."" She slowly approaches, scared that if she gets too close, it will engulf her. The beam of light is now so bright it's just a white sheet in front of her. She takes a deep, inviting breath as she disappears into a bluish-grayish environment new to her.



He is on the other side, a tall, bulky man staring her down like she is his new prey. ""Who are you?"" she softly whispers, still walking towards him. ""I am your angel."" She sits in front of her now, stunned by his beauty and deep green eyes like most of the purest kind. ""Why do I get an angel?"" she thought. ""I am sick and dangerous. I destroy everything I touch. Everyone around me becomes bruised and aching. How do I know he is who he says he is? Maybe he is a mimic or a beautiful hallucination.""



She shuddered at the thought and then stood as straight as she could, loudly and confidently saying, ""Who are you? Tell me the truth."" As he opened his mouth to answer, she felt a wave of anxiety wash over her. ""I am..."" He cut himself off and started a new string of conversations. ""That's not important. All you need to know is I belong to you, and you belong to me."" Was that supposed to make her feel better, that she now owned someone? Well, that didn't do anything for her. Why would it?



""I don't want to be owned by anyone. I don't want to own anyone. I want to live a life that I am proud of. I want to find someone that I can love and cherish."" He smirks a cold and dark smirk. ""Too bad you have no choice."" Only as he says these words, his voice slowly slides up what seems to be like four octaves, matching her voice to a tee. Suddenly, she realizes who he is exactly. ""You're me,"" she blurts out, now cursing under her breath because that should have stayed a thought and only a thought.



She had no idea who he was really or what he was capable of. He then starts to laugh so uncontrollably that he begins to shake. ""You think like a child, don't you, darling?"" He brushed the strands of her hair out of her face with his fingers. ""Think again, and this time, take your time and use your grown-up brain."" She felt an urge to smack in the mouth. How dare he speak to her like that, like he knew her?



As she thought again, she closed her eyes. Staring at him was too distracting at this point because, as scared as she was, she was also comforted by his presence. Who was he? She became stiff and cold to the touch. He noticed quickly, not thrown off by it in the slightest. She felt his breath in her ear, now hot and angry, yet he spoke with a slow and encouraging voice: ""Hurry up, darling; we don't have all day.""



This statement confused her because he had just told her to take her time, and now he was rushing her. ""You're not me."" ""No,"" he said with a soft laugh in his voice, ""you're not an angel."" ""Wrong again, darling,"" he responded, a little less friendly. ""You are..."" ""Hurry up,"" I said. He now barked fast and venomously. Another flash of light came, but this time, she only noticed it in the shadows behind her eyelids.



""He is my shadow."" ""That's exactly what I am, darling."" She heard now with her eyes open. She realized his mouth didn't move at all when she heard that; she listened to his thoughts, or rather their thoughts. ""Why are you here? Why are we here? What is this place?"" Questions now flooded her mind; she looked down at herself and stated, ""This is our home.""



""Home?!"" All other questions were now obsolete. How could this be home? It's dark and lonely. There is nobody here‚Äînot a single soul besides her and him. Nothing made sense. She sucked in a deep breath, pushing away the desire to melt down to the ground and sob. He grabbed her hand firmly and walked her over to a small table that suddenly appeared behind them. She let a few tears escape. He reached his other hand to her face and wiped them away.



Expecting him to wipe them on his clothes, she became bewildered as he placed his now-wet fingers in his mouth, tasting the salt on her tongue. As he did it, all became undeniable.



He is my shadow; my actions are his and mine and his.



""Do you have a name?"" she whispers, her voice trembling with fear.



""You can call me anything you are comfortable with,"" he responds sweetly somehow. That was scarier to Alice‚Äîthat he was so sweet and friendly. It's a matter of time before he is a dark monster. Even when he was impatient earlier, it was almost as if he were a parent frustrated with a child because he could see the potential they had. She flicks back to minutes ago when he was telling her to hurry. The heat in his eyes was never truly venomous; it was instead an anticipation for the truth. He knew who he was, and so did she; she just had to remember.



She slowly stands up, leaving him sitting. Even sitting down, crunched up, he seemed massive compared to her, his stature long and his shoulders broad. He looked like he could easily pick her up and fold her in half if he wanted to, yet his face looked so soft and gentle. He looks at her with questioning eyes.



""So, where are you off to?""



She looks into his eyes and says, ""I am going to explore. There's no way we're the only two here."" His face suddenly drops. He is hiding something, she thought. As quickly as that thought appeared, she heard his voice: ""Do you dare go snooping around here? This isn't your playground."" She was offended by his audacity. He told me this is my home, and now I can't even look around. Make it make sense.



A small child then pokes her head around from a tree and gives out a small giggle. ""You're here! Finally! SHE'S HERE!"" She screamed as if she were an intercom, loud and booming‚Äîwell, as booming as you can be for a small child of her size. Suddenly, a whole group of people came out from every corner of this forest, all different ages and genders, all bearing this sense of familiarity. Even I was sure I had never met any of them before.



""We knew you would make it. We knew you would come home.""



""HOME!"" I repeat loudly, now staring at the man with the moss-colored eyes. ""Who are these people? And I swear to God, if you tell me they're my shadows, I am wringing your neck out with it,"" I say sharply, not wanting to wait for a convoluted lie or excuse. As his lips part to answer, the little girl speaks first.



""We are your family.""



This statement confused me even more than his previous answer. ""Huh? What do you mean you're my family?"" There they are‚Äîthe tears I was pushing back now a never-ending faucet. A taller girl who looked like she couldn't be older than fourteen then moved in front of the little girl and grabbed my hand. Her hand is cold, and her eyes are watering.



""We are your family,"" she repeats. ""We are all different parts of you‚Äîshadows, if you will."" She gives a slight chuckle, glancing at him. But the confusion has grown into full-blown anger; without thinking, I exploded.



""DO NOT LAUGH AT THIS! This is not fucking funny!""



She quickly apologizes as a new person speaks up from the back of the group. ""Isn't it, though, funny? I mean, we have been in here so long, and you finally get here demanding answers from day one without even so much as a hello.""



""This isn't my fault,"" I spit back.



""It's not ours either, not even his."" He gestures to the moss-eyed man. ""So let's start this over, shall we? Hello, I'm Dante. Who are you?""



I took a long, deep breath and calmly said, 'My name is Clara.' However, after I introduced myself, the same voice spoke again in a straightforward manner. ""No, it's not. Try again this time; think a little harder."" That made me angry all over again. What did he mean? No, it's not. I was sure I knew my name, but I humored him, closed my eyes, and thought, Who am I? What's my name?



As soon as that question left my mind's eye, I heard a loud, angry, almost violent voice scream: ""Alice Sofia Rossi, come here!"" My eyes snapped open, and suddenly, I was no longer in the forest; I was in a house, staring at my mother, who had tears welling in her eyes. I couldn't tell if they were angry tears or tears of sadness. She was at the front door of the house, door wide open, her hands now on my shoulders.



She looks at me and says, ""Your dad is here. Bye.""



There is a car outside, a man in the driver's seat, and no one else in the car. I say, ""Okay, Mama, I love you. Bye."" She, still looking at me, says, ""Bye,"" and just like that, I am in the car alone with my dad. My eyes close again and open to the forest again. What was that?! That was the first time you saw us. That makes zero sense, though; you weren't there. It was just my parents and me. How old were you? Give an educated guess. Dante says I had to have been no more than five years old. That was your first split‚Äîthe first time you couldn't handle what was happening in your life. After that car ride, I showed up at my grandma's house. I noticed it wasn't me speaking now.



At all, it was that little girl, now scared and trembling. ""Are you okay?"" I say quietly to her. ""I was there, not you,"" she whimpered. ""So your name is Alice too?"" I ask. She responds, almost in a trance-like state, ""My name is Cecilia. I am 5 years old."" I start speaking to Dante again, ""If you're all parts of me, how are you all different people of all different ages and genders? We are all at the age where we can handle what is going on in life, so our brain creates people who do it for us. We don't know why we are all different genders, though, so I did it. I caused you all pain and suffering. I am a monster. I knew it.""



""No, not at all. None of this is your fault; it's not our fault either. It's the fault of the people who were supposed to protect you."" I started to feel sick; I doubled over, nearly dry-heaving. All of these people are me, but not; they're stronger than me in so many ways. Even the little girl who can barely speak is stronger than me. I couldn't handle my own life, so they stepped in to take over. Why couldn't I handle it? There are many others in the world who endure the same, and they could, but not me‚Äîno, my brain broke. Isn't that what happened when it became a ""normal"" occurrence? My brain cracked and shattered into a mess of people.



How many people are here? I slowly start counting, reaching an easy twelve. There could be more, but even at twelve, my head starts swimming. ""All of you are my saviors; you bore the burdens I couldn't thank you,"" I start saying as I fall to my knees, tears streaming down my face. ""Stand up, please! You do not need to thank us for this; if anything, you need to get to know all of us because we hold the secrets of your life that you can't remember.""



""It's not that you weren't here for it all; you were‚Äîyou were just riding passenger if you will. Once you start talking to us more, you'll remember; it won't be as scary as it feels right now."" These words came from an older woman who looked as old as my mother. She was a short, brown-haired girl tied in a ponytail. She was smiling, but it seemed forced‚Äîlike she wasn't happy, more just trying to put me at ease. Her eyes were soft and inviting.



""Come with us; we will protect you as we have all these years, but this time, you will get to drive. Sometimes, you're stronger now, and you're getting stronger every day. It may be terrifying at times, but you will learn to love the person you have become."" I look at her now, slightly confused because how can I learn to love myself and not them? She said, ""Oh silly girl, we are you‚Äîwell, rather parts of you. You can learn to love us too if you would like, but our main goal in our existence is to get you to heal and learn to love yourself.""



""You have been through so much in your life, but do not go blaming everyone,"" she was quick to say because the people you relied on did the best they could most of the time. They had no idea what was going on, and when they found out, it was too late to fix the damage that occurred. Now, I know some of those people hurt you separately, and they were wrong for doing that and should have owned up to those actions, but you can't blame them entirely. Even if you have done things in your life that were horrible and hurt many people, you are slowly trying to repair that damage, heal yourself, and help those around you. We are so proud of you.



""When I heal, will you all leave me?"" Alice whispers enough that it could have easily been to calm herself rather than a question for the girl. Even so, the girl responds, ""No, we will be here‚Äîat least, Which confused Alice. ""Only some of you?"" she thought. ""Yes, as you heal, some of us will leave, then rendered unneeded."" Is this all a dream? Am I going to suddenly wake up and be in my bed in the real world? ""Fuck no, this is not a dream,"" Alice heard from the back of the crowd, a deep, gravelly voice that she knew wasn't Dante but someone far darker in intent.



""Who was that?"" Alice snapped back. ""Name's Lucious,"" he quickly retorted. Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted; it grew quiet and still, all eyes now on Alice. She felt like a fish in a tiny bowl. Little Cecilia toddled up to her, very unsteady on her feet, balancing on her tiptoes. She slowly reached up, offering her small hand. Alice looked at her hand for a brief minute; her little fingers curled towards the sky naturally. But not wanting to make Cecilia uncomfortable, she darted her eyes back to the little one and grabbed her hand. Cecilia let out another small giggle and smiled widely.



""Come see,"" she said, pulling Alice towards a group of tall trees. Weary but curious, Alice followed. They looped around the bend of the trees, and a small house appeared, no bigger than a studio apartment. ""What the hell?"" Alice whispered, thinking, has this always been here? It didn't seem that way when I first arrived. Cecilia knocked on the door, and Alice heard hurried clicks of heels running towards it.



""Hold on, I am coming,"" a high-pitched voice called out. Then, the door opened to reveal a massive front entryway. A short-haired girl stood in the doorway, ushering Alice to come in with a slight smile on her face. ""Welcome home, hun,"" she said. ""I am Francesca."" She was elegant and poised, almost as if she had hopped out of a fashion magazine.



""Nice to meet you. I am Alice.""



""Oh, no, you don't need to introduce yourself. I know exactly who you are. We have been waiting for you."" She then locked the door and walked off into a hallway. Alice looked around at the entryway, dumbfounded by how big this place truly was on the inside. It didn't make any sense‚Äîhow could a place that looked no bigger than a studio apartment be this big?



She noticed a giant projector-style screen on the wall. Below it was a long table that accommodated four chairs lengthwise, positioned behind which the hallway walls separate two lounge couches. Aside from the sofa on the right side, there was a set of double doors, and on the left sat a small coffee bar, a coffee table, and a window looking out to the forest. Alice stood in awe at what she was looking at when suddenly a robotic-sounding voice came from an intercom system: ""You can look around more if you'd like. I promise it is okay. This is your home.""



Now accepting this as a fact, she turned to face the double doors and walked into a mid-sized kitchen that was too small for the double doors it had. It was your typical kitchen‚Äînothing special‚Äîbut she could see someone had been in it recently. A plate of cold toast sat on the counter next to an empty coffee cup. She grabbed the cup and placed it in the sink, leaving the toast sitting on the counter, unsure if someone was done with it.



Turning, she walked through a small door in the kitchen, revealing a closet with a mop. On the other wall was a second door that led her into a hallway lined with many doors‚Äîsome bearing names, others decorated. Just then, Francesca walked out of a room.



""Follow me,"" she said with a gentle smile. Alice was jealous of how good Francesca's makeup looked; she could never get the hang of it herself. Following Francesca, they stopped in front of a bare and plain white door.



""This is your room,"" Francesca said. ""You are free to decorate it any way you want, and if you want any help, I am always here."" Francesca was short‚Äîshort‚Äîbarely surpassing Cecilia's height. Alice wondered if she, too, was a child or just short.



""How old are you, Francesca?""



""I am 19. I know I might not seem like it with my height."" She gave a light chuckle and then asked Alice for her age.



""I don't understand how you know my name and that I belong here but do not know my age.""



""Because we aren't all-knowing, silly,"" Francesca playfully said.



Alice wondered where everyone else was; it had been a while since she last saw them in the middle of a forest, even though this was their house. Then she got curious. ""Why were you when I arrived and not with everyone else?"" I asked. Certainly, someone needed to stay in the house to ensure he didn't break in, so I volunteered. I needed my makeup anyway. She said this so casually, as if she knew who she was talking about.



""Who?"" I said, confused. ""Oh right, you have no idea what I am saying, Diavolo. He is a horrible, mean person."" I had not met anyone like that today. Everyone I had encountered had been at least cordial‚Äînot exactly lovely, but not horrible either‚Äîand no one by that name had spoken to me.



She pushed my face to face hers, and our eyes met. ""Are you positive?"" she asked in a very stern way, though I could see the slight panic in her expression.



""Yes, I am sure about that. I promise you.""



""Listen to me. You need to never listen to him. No matter what he says, he is bad and will try to take over the body."" Before I even had time to respond, I heard a rush of voices in the entryway. Suddenly, she snapped back to her usual bubbly self, smiled, and said, ""Sweet, they're home! Let's go hang out with everyone.""



We turned to leave my room, but I was still left confused and scared. Still, I couldn't show them that I had just arrived, so I put on a smile and walked out with Francesca.



""Hey, everybody,"" she said as we entered the main room.



""Hey,"" they all replied in unison.



""I'm glad you're all back; I missed you guys.""



""You saw us three hours ago,"" a girl replied, obviously annoyed by Francesca's exuberance.



""Oh, fuck off. I'm just happy to be here with everyone. We never get to anymore."" Damn, it's been three hours? It hadn't felt like more than half an hour, and why was that girl so rude to Francesca?



""So, anyone trying to smoke?"" Dante asked from one end of the long table.



""Oh yeah,"" Francesca said. ""I'm the girl from before,"" she added, her tone less annoyed this time.



""I grab the papers. Someone grab the bud,"" Lucious called out as he walked to his room. Then, another tall, almost bald man walked off without saying a word. Cecilia started running to her room, chanting, ""Tea party time!""



You could hear a loud door slam, followed by upbeat music. That one guy returned, holding a large jar packed with dusty purple buds.



""I will roll,"" a girl commented.



""Thanks, Adrienne,"" Dante replied.



I plopped down on the floor in front of the couch. I preferred the floor; it felt safer, especially in these uncertain times. I didn't know them well enough to sit so close to them.



As the rotation progressed, we began to get to know each other better. Adrienne was 18 and into dark, witchy things; she wasn't very keen on socializing. She was a tall, slender girl with long black hair that covered one side of her face like a curtain. Lucious was a large-built guy who looked like he belonged on a football team. He seemed very unfriendly, yet Cecilia was his kryptonite. 

Dante was a shorter man, standing at about 5'7"". He had been nice enough to everyone, yet Alice already knew he could be an ass when he wanted to be. 



The short brown-haired woman now had a name, too. She was the honest Clara. When Alice started to think back to the woods, she realized that she had blurted out Clara when Dante asked for her name. 



Alice didn't even know Clara at that point, so why did that name come out? Alice knew her name and had never once needed to say anything else. Once the blunts turned to roaches, everyone started drifting off on their own. Alice, trying to remember everything that she had learned today, strolled into the kitchen, hoping there was chamomile tea. 



Cecilia and Lucious were sitting at the table with milk and cookies and offered some to Alice. She politely declined and asked Lucious if there was any tea in the kitchen. Lucious just looked at her, confused for a second, and then Cecilia turned to him and started signing. It quickly clicked that Lucious was deaf. Although Alice wasn't fluent in American Sign Language, she knew enough to talk casually.



Cecilia stood up and pointed to the top cabinet, which was filled with tea. Alice grabbed a tea bag and mug, made a cup of tea, and carried it to her room. Her room was empty and white, like a hospital room, but it did not bother her much. It brought an odd sense of comfort. It had a queen bed and a large wooden dresser already in it. Besides that, it was empty. 



Alice had enough thinking and confusion for the night, so she finished off her tea and set it on the dresser. Then, she turned off the light and tucked herself into bed.

IMDb Summary: A series of misunderstandings leaves an advertising executive with a campaign for a product which has not yet been invented, while he romances his rival in the guise of its inventor.

Starring Doris Day, Rock Hudson, Tony Randall, Edie Adams, Ann B. Davis, and Donna Douglas. 

So, I usually feel like a Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedy is easy enough for a Saturday morning flick. I had a really, really bad day yesterday involving work and I am still not in a great frame of mind so something like this is just‚Ä¶easy. 

It is also a Rom-Com. They tend to be my ‚Äúguilty favorites‚Äù too so my hope was I could grab and run with this as a bit of comfort as well. 

So I popped it in after Zedd joined me for coffee and a poptart. 

However, about 40 minutes in I realized I had forgotten there was a movie on, and needed to snap myself back into it. Oops! 

Okay, so what made this one not as good as *Pillow Talk* or *Send Me No Flowers*, especially considering they were 80% the same movie? 

It just wasn‚Äôt that believable. Doris Day‚Äôs ‚ÄúCarol Templeton‚Äù is just *too dense* for my liking. To the same extent, Rock Hudson‚Äôs ‚ÄúJerry Webster‚Äù just a little too cruel in some of his execution. 

The ending of the film was just too contrived. Getting there was boring. 

We have several other films left in this collection and I am happy to view them all. I will start at 50 each and every time. As shown by *Pillow Talk* which I found to be fun and engaging, there is potential there!

Both of us are in school working on our degrees and still partially financially dependent on our parents. Meanwhile, we're both working in the service industry to make some money to pay the rest of our bills: she's a barista at Starbucks while I'm a petsitter on Rover. Both of us make some of our money from tips. She makes a certain amount of money per hour, while mine is gig work. Neither of us makes much, but she makes considerably more than I do. Rover also takes 20% of what I make (except for tips). I see my friend about 1-2 times a month during the school year, more often on summer break. Whenever we get together, we almost always go out to eat, because she often has a new restaurant she wants me to try.

We have different views regarding tipping culture.

My dad told me that in the old days, tipping was a reward for exceptional service. In the context of waiters, this meant always keeping your water glass full, asking you if the meal was good, coming over when summoned, and overall giving you a very pleasant experience at the restaurant. I've adopted this opinion, and I work hard to provide exceptional service to my clients in hopes of tips. I'll ask clients a bunch of questions when meeting them to get a good idea of what their pet is like; send them several pics and updates of their pets everyday; communicate well; and even lightly clean their homes before they come back. I usually get tips, sometimes very generous ones. However, the tips are usually equivalent to the 20% that Rover takes from my total earnings, even if I go above and beyond. I don't expect tips if I don't go above and beyond.

I feel the tipping culture has gotten out of control. I'm still asked for a tip at restaurant where I bus my own table, at coffee shops where I'm just being handed a muffin off the display rack, etc. At a frozen yogurt shop my friend and I went to, there was only one cashier on duty, on his phone. I had to get his attention to come out and ring us up. Yet the thing still asked for a tip.

Because of this, I don't usually tip. I'll tip for exceptional service, like for my hair stylist who always does a great job and I've developed a rapport with. But for people workers who are just doing the (bare) minimum, I don't. The other problem is that I don't always know where the tip's going. Sometime the service worker keeps all of it, sometimes the owner takes it, and sometimes it shared among all the workers. I want it to just go to the person serving me, not be divvied up.

My friend believes differently. I always see her tip. She says we should tip because with wages for service workers like waiters and baristas being so low, the tips help them pay their bills. The last time we ate a restaurant, we were discussing this. Feeling pressure from her tip, I tipped $10 on a $63 meal (about $80 including sales tax). I paid the check, and she paid me back her half, including tax and tip.

She doesn't often bring up tipping when we get together, but she happened to bring it up this time because she's noticed I don't usually tip. Since she always tips, I always feel pressure from her to tip when we eat out, and I try to hide the fact I don't tip. I wish she wouldn't bring it up at all; it's my money I'm spending when I pay to eat out (she pays for what she orders). I don't tell her how to spend her money.

AITA for not tipping service workers all the time and wishing there wasn't pressure from her to tip for mediocre service?

Edit 1: My friend grew up lower middle-class/poor. Her mom worked in the service industry her entire career, while her father was a mechanic. I grew up mid- to lower middle-class; My dad was in IT while my mom was a teacher.

Edit 2: The frozen yogurt shop was a self-serve place, where customers take a cup, get their own frozen yogurt, and their own toppings. The cashier just weighs the cup of yogurt and toppings and rings them up.

Edit 3: By ""lightly clean"" my clients homes, I mean scooping dog poop in the backyard, putting the dirty dishes I used in the dishwasher, stripping the bed I slept in and putting the bedding next to the washer, and vacuuming up pet fur. I don't reorganize or do any major cleaning.",0,1751146342.0,AITAH,10,0.25,False

I've been brewing coffee using a Bialetti moka pot for over a year now, happily enjoying medium to dark roast coffees. Life was pretty good! But a couple of months ago, thanks to YouTube, I got fascinated with the V60 method. So I got myself a V60 brewer, ordered some light roast beans, and wow... an iced pour-over really hits differently, especially when it's 40¬∞C outside! It was like discovering a completely new coffee universe.

I've spent quite some time diving deep into YouTube videos and experimenting with various recipes. The biggest lesson? Brewing is all about trial and error. There are just so many variables grind size, water temperature, pouring rate, that managing them efficiently became challenging.

That's when an idea struck me: what if there was an assistant to simplify managing these variables? So, I built a small web app specifically for iced V60 brewing. It tracks timing, brewing stages, and coffee-to-water ratios, helping me save time and better experiment with my brews. I've been using it personally for over a month now, and it‚Äôs been a real game changer for me.

The best part? Everything is customizable. Adjust the settings, grind size, coffee ratios exactly how you like it.

Right now, it‚Äôs tailored just for iced pour-over because, for some reason, I'm completely hooked on iced coffee (I haven't had a hot coffee in six months!). But down the line, I'm planning to expand the app to include assistants for hot V60, moka pot, and cold brew methods too.

The friend(s) you‚Äôve known since middle school, the one who shows up at your doorstep with wine and snacks when everything‚Äôs falling apart? Were you there for her first real love? Her first devastating heartbreak? The offer letter for her ‚Äúreal adult job‚Äù? Did you both backpack through Thailand and sip mai tais at a beachside caf√©, talking for hours about your dreams, your fears, your pet peeves and your deepest wounds?

I hear friendships like that exist. Allegedly.

They may form early and solidify through the years, growing stronger across milestones and miles. Some people get lifers, the kind of friends who remember your worst haircuts and your best days. They text back within minutes. They show up without being asked. You are grateful for your friendship even when you have petty fights.

Is Rachel real? I can't help but wonder.

I think I‚Äôve occasionally had a Rachel here and there, for a little while. They were seasonal friends, those who briefly appeared because we shared a class, a workplace, a neighborhood, a moment. Playdates, a lunch invite, the occasional coffee or concert. We faded apart with distance, or schedules, or unspoken disappointments. Sometimes we fought and patched things up, but the closeness never returned quite the same.

It‚Äôs always been like this for me. Since childhood, I‚Äôve had a large circle of acquaintances. Very surface level. Nowadays we know each other's names, but not much more beyond our job titles. Maybe a hobby or two that we don't share.

Most days, literally nearly every day, it‚Äôs just me, myself, and I. Not for lack of trying with texts, phone calls, and making plans. Certainly not for lack of wanting.

It‚Äôs just the way it‚Äôs always been. I‚Äôve never been a bridesmaid. I‚Äôve only been to a handful of weddings, and usually on the fringe as a plus-one, coworker, distant relative. I‚Äôm not the honorary auntie people think to call when they need a sitter, or an emergency contact. At 35, I just had my first group vacation, a weekend with a couple of acquaintances. It was nice. But that was the first time we‚Äôd hung out in months, and I wouldn‚Äôt quite call them friends. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

I‚Äôm not angry or bitter. Just noticing. Naming. Acknowledging a kind of quiet loneliness that doesn‚Äôt scream, but hums beneath the surface. Knowing that some people walk through life surrounded by their gal pals and chosen family. And others, like me, move quietly beside them.

Silonn SLIM01B Reviewed!,"Using the Silonn SLIM01B has been a game-changer in my chaotic little home. The kitchen always seems to magnetize friends, family, and dog sitters, and without fail ‚Äî someone always wants a cold drink. My fridge‚Äôs ice maker died two years ago and I swore I'd replace it ""soonish,"" but laziness won until I finally caved and picked up the Silonn Countertop Ice Maker, and honestly? I kind of wish I'd done it earlier. It doesn't just crank out ice at a ridiculous pace; it's got a few surprises that make it ideal for daily and party use alike.

**Compact Design Meets Everyday Functionality**

Space is sacred in my kitchen. Between the air fryer, toaster, and two coffee machines (don't judge me), I didn‚Äôt think an ice machine would physically fit without becoming a permanent tripping hazard. Surprisingly, this unit with its 12.3‚Äù depth and less-than-9‚Äù width managed to squeeze in beside my blender like it belonged there. It has a sleek ‚Äúupgraded black‚Äù finish ‚Äî more graphite than jet black ‚Äî and does a good job of looking pricier than it is. Plus, at just over 15 pounds, I‚Äôve brought it outside for a backyard grill night without breaking a sweat.

**Speed Demon in the Ice World**

The main draw here is speed. Imagine this: guests arrive, someone finally asks for a margarita, and boom ‚Äî you're out of ice. Total party foul. Thankfully, this ice maker spits out nine bullet ice cubes in six minutes. I actually timed it during my test run, and yep ‚Äî just slightly over six minutes, but good enough for real-life emergencies. Over a 24-hour period, it can make up to 26 pounds if you‚Äôre really going for it. I didn‚Äôt camp by it for a full day, but after multiple party uses, I can confirm it seems to live up to that number.

[Ready to buy Silonn SLIM01B? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0c9str57d/)

**Smart Ice Options You Didn't Know You Needed**

This ice maker gives you the option to choose between two cube sizes, and that‚Äôs not something I expected to be useful... until it was. I use the smaller bullet-shaped ice for chilling shrimp and quick-cooling beers. The larger size is perfect for sodas or iced tea ‚Äî they melt slower and don't water drinks down too quickly. It's also super quiet. I work from home and have it whirring away near my desk, and unless you're listening for it, you won‚Äôt notice. The clear lid is a subtle but helpful feature because I can peek in and see if I‚Äôm running low without fiddling with the controls.

**User-Friendly All the Way**

Everyone in my family, including my permanently confused uncle who once tried to microwave foil, figured out how to use this thing in seconds. The control panel has minimal buttons ‚Äî just one to power it on and another to pick the ice size. It alerts you if the water‚Äôs low or the ice basket is full, and yes, it actually stops making ice before flooding your counter. That auto shut-off sensor has saved me from coming home to mini glacier disasters more than once.

**Highlights**

- Produces 9 pieces of bullet ice in around 6 minutes  
- Capable of generating up to 26 lbs of ice every 24 hours  
- Compact design fits easily on most countertops  
- Two ice sizes adapt to different drink and food cooling needs  

**Flaws**

- No self-replenishment: it doesn‚Äôt hook up to a water line, so you‚Äôve got to manually refill the 2L tank  
- Ice melts if left in the basket too long since there‚Äôs no refrigeration unit  
- Fingerprints show easily on the black surface  
- The ice cubes can sometimes stick together after sitting in the basket too long

**Product Competitors**

Compared side-by-side with machines like the GE Profile Opal 2.0 and the Frigidaire EFIC117, the Silonn version makes a very tight case for itself. The Opal offers nugget ice, which people seem weirdly obsessed with ‚Äî but it comes at more than triple the cost and with greater noise and maintenance. The Frigidaire makes cube ice but is bulkier and has a slower cycle. Where this model stands out is the speed-to-size ratio and its no-fuss setup. No apps. No weird Bluetooth integration. Just plug and go. That‚Äôs something I personally prefer.

**Bang for the Buck**

This machine strikes a really solid balance in cost and performance. You‚Äôre not getting smart connectivity ‚Äî no scheduling your ice queue from a smartphone, sorry. But you are getting a fast, reliable, and portable ice maker with genuinely useful features like automatic cleaning and auto-shutoff. For the price, it delivers on the essentials without filler. You wouldn‚Äôt expect a machine this compact to keep up with a party crowd, but it does ‚Äî and pretty quietly too.

So my husband and I did have an argument about this other day and I told him it‚Äôs really REALLY hard for me to find friends as I‚Äôd prefer to have a close knit friend(s) I can really be myself around. 

He wanted me to be friends with the other wives of his coworkers but it‚Äôs extremely hard because 1) I‚Äôm the youngest and definitely act young (party person ish) 2) I have 0 desire to have any children (most of them have kids or are trying to have kids 3) no similar interests AT ALL. 

I am really good friends with one of them but again it‚Äôs hard because we don‚Äôt have a lot in common and she just had a baby so, and she doesn‚Äôt drink due to religious commitments üò≠

I‚Äôm not by any means religious nor do I like religion. I respect your beliefs, but I really like to stay away from it. I‚Äôm liberal as well so I‚Äôd like to find someone who has common political beliefs, although I can see both sides I‚Äôm not one side is right kind of person. 

My interests are every where a little. My biggest hobbies are working out at the gym (I love lifting and being strong) and going to music festivals/shows (i.e., lost lands, edc, hard summer, beyond, rampage, you name it). I strictly listen to edm, but depending on my mood will I listen to Chappell Roan or similar artists. My favorite genres of edm is dubstep (the wonky kind, idk how else to describe it) trap, drum n bass, and experimental bass. I‚Äôll listen to house if I‚Äôm in the mood for it lol. 

I also really love anime. I don‚Äôt cosplay or go to conventions but I really enjoy the shows. I‚Äôve watched some of the main ones but not Naruto or one piece, I‚Äôm sorry I refuse üò≠ 

My favorite drink is an espresso martini but I like other martinis as well! I don‚Äôt drink often but sometimes I like to get a little buzz on and be silly!! I‚Äôd be so down to explore little places where they have really cool drinks and what not. 

I‚Äôm a very active person, I like paddle boarding, hiking, I‚Äôd be down to explore a city on city bikes or just walk around. I‚Äôm a huge coffee person too so if you have any recommendations of coffee shops in sac I‚Äôd love that! 

I have a masters in clinical psych and plan to go back for my masters in counseling to become an lpcc! This is another interest of mine as well. 

I‚Äôd prefer female friends out of respect for my husband. :) I‚Äôve been pretty busy lately due to working like 3 jobs M-F BUT as soon as I‚Äôm caught up I‚Äôd love to hangout! 

I know this is a shot in the dark but I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd try and put myself out there!",3,1751145733.0,SacramentoFriends,0,0.8,False

I've recently found out that the year before we met Stephanie was involved in a scandal where it was discovered she was messaging 11 year olds explicit messages when she had a position of authority.
I'm really upset by it and if I knew at the time I probably wouldn't have spent time with her. She never told me. Since I found this out I can't stop thinking about it. I don't know how to act around her now. We are scheduled to meet in 2 weeks but I don't want to go. What would you do?

Any Tips?,"***For context ‚Äî I'm 39M and have only been in two relationships. One was a 15-year marriage where we had a child but later divorced. A year and a half later, I dated someone for 4 years who likely had undiagnosed BPD. That dynamic was incredibly difficult but mirrored a lot of my needs and ultimately led to my ADHD diagnosis last October.***

That said‚Ä¶ **I don‚Äôt know how to date**.

Both my past relationships grew organically out of friendship. They already knew what kind of oddball I am and loved me anyway. Modern dating, on the other hand, feels like a job interview ‚Äî and I suck at job interviews.

I went on a date this past Monday with someone I had a lot in common with. Our differences complemented each other. Still, the date went **terrible**.

She picked a trendy hipster coffee shop ‚Äî more bar than caf√© ‚Äî on one of the hottest days of the year. *No AC. Loud. Crowded.* **I was so overstimulated** and had trouble focusing, staying on topic, or avoiding impulsive overshares. Some moments were great; others were a mess.

Before the date, she mentioned **loving stationery** and **a ‚Äútravelling notebook‚Äù idea** I had for a party. So I made her one, a small notebook with a first-page prompt about first impressions. At the end of the date, I gave it to her and said, if she wanted to see me again, to bring it back and we‚Äôd fill it with new prompts ‚Äî and see how far we get.   
  
**Thought it would be a fun creative thing to do.** 

She said it was sweet. We ended on a half-hug. It felt awkward. By the time I got home, she messaged: *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not compatible. Thank you for your time.‚Äù* I replied, *‚ÄúThank you, take care,‚Äù* and accepted it.

**Now I‚Äôm stuck with a dilemma:**

*Do I keep trying to date people I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî feeling completely unequipped for this dating model? Should I just stick to organic connections through my existing network? Or maybe even consider dating others with ADHD?*

**Not sure how to move forward. Appreciate any advice.**",1,1751145519.0,ADHD,6,0.57,False

Well.. basically, I‚Äôve been working in the company TECH for 2 years after my graduation but unfortunately they‚Äôve been going through some tough time. They could not give me a contract I wanted and could not sponsor my visa. I did not want to leave them because the company was great, I loved every single bit of it, but it was a necessity back then. I got an offer from a company HOTEL which was not great money-wise but the company was nice. Young and dynamic as well and my visa was my top priority, so I took it. Nobody from company TECH wanted me to leave but they understood my decision.

It‚Äôs been 8 months and I established myself quite well already. Everybody is very happy with me, I got many responsibilities and i always claimed that I was happy with them during my performance reviews (which was true). The job is nice, I am building something new for the team and it‚Äôs very meaningful and rewarding. They all have high hopes and we recently made a plan of what I‚Äôm going to do over summer which is a huge project which everyone wants. There are disadvantages, of course, such as longer working hours, office almost 2h ride from home, my boss being a bitch sometimes and my salary. I feel severely underpaid, partially because I lowballed myself during the first interview (because I needed a job and a visa). And I knew that I can ask for a max 10% raise (and I‚Äôd probably stay junior for another year min). 

Today I got a call from my previous manager, we stayed in very good relationship so we set up a meeting, went on some coffee where she invited me back to the company TECH as things have changed. They are ready to give me a more senior position and a +30% more money than I‚Äôm getting now. I know the company TECH very well, people are great, the job is great and it would be an insanely good career move.

The question is. I don‚Äôt know how to tell company HOTEL. That would definitely be seen as a betrayal. They all have such a high hopes and I had zero indication that I was unhappy or that I would leave anytime soon. It low key looks like to going back to your ex lol.

1lmxkpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1lmxkpl/20250628_health_headlines_breakthroughs_urgent/,(2025-06-28) Health Headlines Breakthroughs Urgent Updates June 28,"Here's a comprehensive summary of the health news from the overnight to early morning period of June 28, 2025, integrating all provided source summaries:

**Health News Roundup: June 28, 2025**

The health news landscape on June 28, 2025, presented a mixed bag of concerns, advancements, and personal stories. From emerging threats in the vaping industry to developments in exercise and metabolism, several key themes dominated the headlines.

**Vaping Concerns and Regulatory Push:**

A major story emerging from the University of California, Davis, revealed a potentially alarming health risk associated with disposable e-cigarettes. A new study published in *ACS Central Science* found that certain disposable vape devices released significantly higher levels of toxic metals, including lead, nickel, and antimony, than both older e-cigarette models and combustible tobacco products.  In a particularly concerning finding, one disposable e-cigarette studied released more lead in a single day's use than the equivalent of nearly 20 packs of traditional cigarettes.  These findings have triggered ""urgent calls for tighter regulation"" of the disposable vape market, a segment especially popular among adolescents and young adults. The study emphasizes the need for swift action to mitigate potential health risks, especially among vulnerable populations.

**Hospital Infrastructure and Patient Care:**

In Maharashtra, Sassoon General Hospital is set to undergo significant modernization. Minister of State for Medical Education Madhuri Misal conducted a detailed review of the hospital's progress and identified areas for improvement.  The initiative involves substantial investments in new medical equipment and patient services. Specifically, the hospital will acquire a new CT scan (costing ‚Çπ7.5 crore), an MRI (‚Çπ27 crore), and a cath lab (‚Çπ17 crore).  This modernization effort highlights a commitment to upgrading healthcare infrastructure to provide better patient care.

**Exercise and Weight Management:**

The role of exercise in weight loss continues to be a significant focus.  Studies suggest that high-calorie-burning exercises, such as running, swimming, and HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), contribute to a larger calorie deficit in a shorter time frame. However, the news also emphasizes that weight loss can be achieved effectively with lower-calorie-burning exercises if performed consistently. Creating a balanced workout routine tailored to individual goals and lifestyles is key.

**Metabolism and Personal Health: Salman Khan and Salim Khan**

Salman Khan, speaking fondly of his father, Salim Khan, highlighted the significant role of metabolism.  Salman noted his father‚Äôs remarkable ability to consume a large quantity of food‚Äîincluding multiple paranthas, rice, and meat‚Äîtwice a day, due to a unique metabolism.  Salman's own routine follows an ""old school, typical bodybuilding"" regime involving ""giant set"" workouts- around 10 chest variations done back-to-back in a HIIT‚Äëstyle format, all within a disciplined 45-to-60-minute session. This news touches on personal health and habits.

**Notable Personal Health News**

The news of Shefali Jariwala's passing at the age of 42, reportedly due to a cardiac arrest, serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of heart health.

**Medical Advancements and Treatments:**

The news contained snippets of new research and findings regarding medical advancements:
*   Phase 3 trials show that 99.9% of people remained HIV negative with two annual shots.
*   Orforglipron is a smaller molecule that allows better absorption of the drug through the gut
*   Drinking coffee without sugar or cream can lower risk of death by 14 per cent

**Diverse Health-Related Topics:**

Beyond these major themes, the news summaries touched on a variety of other health-related topics:

*   **Lifestyle Corrections:**  The importance of lifestyle adjustments from an early age was highlighted.
*   **Food and Diet:** The effects of shuffling food for better blood sugar regulation and the value of Jamun seeds in powdered form.
*   **Mental and Brain Health:**  The role of various areas of the brain working together, also discussing the effects of overwork on creativity.
*   **Mental Health:** The importance of knowing which conditions are concerning and when to consult a doctor.
*   **Alternative Therapies**: Some people rely on alternative therapies to find their balance.
*   **Social Media Impact:** Caution was advised regarding the potential exaggeration or misrepresentation of risks associated with sunscreens and perfumes on social media.

**Conclusion:**

The health news from this period paints a complex picture. There's a growing awareness of the need for regulation, particularly concerning emerging health risks like disposable vapes. At the same time, the potential for improved health and well-being through exercise, lifestyle modifications, and advancements in treatments is also present. The focus on hospital infrastructure upgrades, combined with the personal stories of individuals like Salman Khan and Shefali Jariwala, underscores the multifaceted nature of health concerns and the importance of holistic approaches to well-being.

At **Auto Style PPF** (we‚Äôre in **Sugar Grove, IL**, near **Naperville**), we just finished a [full vinyl wrap](https://www.autostyleppf.com/) on a 2003 **BMW Z3**. This Beemer came in with faded black paint, scratches, and rock chips everywhere typical for a 20+ year old daily driver.

The owner wanted something fresh without dropping $$$$ on new paint. So we wrapped it in [3M gloss pearl white](https://www.autostyleppf.com/) and it looks like it just rolled out of the showroom. He‚Äôs pumped to show it at Beemer festivals, cars and coffee meets, and just enjoy driving it again.

If you‚Äôre wondering if a wrap is worth it for an older car, here are 5 reasons why it is:

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hides Faded Paint & Scratches

A wrap instantly covers ugly faded clear coat, scratches, and rock chips. Boom fresh new look.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Adds Protection

The wrap acts like armor for what‚Äôs left of the original paint. UV rays, bird droppings, and rock chips won‚Äôt destroy it further.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cheaper than a Repaint

A full repaint can cost more than your car is worth. A quality **car wrap** is more affordable, and you get a **3-year labor warranty** plus **6‚Äì8 years warranty from 3M**.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ So Many Colors & Finishes

Gloss, matte, satin, metallic, color flip it‚Äôs all possible. This Z3 went from dull to show-ready.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Makes You Love the Car Again

When your car looks good, you enjoy driving it more and you‚Äôre proud to show it off. This Z3‚Äôs owner plans to keep it for another 15 years!

So if you‚Äôve got an old ride sitting in the garage and you want it to look brand new, hit up a local [vinyl wrap shop](https://www.autostyleppf.com/wrap). And if you‚Äôre in **Sugar Grove, IL** or **Naperville**, come see us at **Auto Style PPF** we do **car wraps**, **PPF**, and **ceramic coatings** too.

**Transform. Protect. Enhance.**

Before Shift ‚Äì 8:21 PM

I‚Äôve started making it a habit‚Äîshowing up two hours early. The store doesn‚Äôt mind. If anything, it seems to wait for me.

I brought gumbo in a thermos tonight. Real food. Shared food. I also grabbed a tin of salted maple caramels from that weird little confectionary across town. The place that wasn‚Äôt there last week.

I asked Rico if he wanted any before I clocked in. He shook his head.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still working third shift?‚Äù he asked, like it was a terminal illness.



I nodded. ‚ÄúGot no reason not to.‚Äù

He winced, leaned forward, whispered like the tile might be listening:

> ‚ÄúSometimes I dream about it. Third shift. But I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre my dreams.‚Äù



Then he pushed past me and started shutting down the register.
9:48 PM.

They‚Äôre always gone before the minute hand hits ten.


---

During Shift ‚Äì 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM

At 10:01, the lights dimmed‚Äînot from lack of power, but as if the store was blinking.

I clocked in, made the nightly offering at Register One‚Äîthis time, a warm biscuit from the gumbo, carefully wrapped‚Äîand poured a small plastic bowl of the stew beside it. Lila hadn‚Äôt appeared yet, but I felt the air shift. Warmer, but heavier. Like a breath on the back of my neck.

11:33 PM

A woman entered the store. Tight skirt, fur coat, high heels that never actually touched the floor.

She looked like a woman, if you didn‚Äôt look too long.
Too smooth. Too symmetrical. Eyes the same shade as raw meat. Hair that moved a second too slow behind her.

> ‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúdo you carry fireflies in glass?‚Äù



I blinked. ‚ÄúNo ma‚Äôam. Closest I‚Äôve got is jarred olives.‚Äù

She laughed. The wrong sound came out. Like glass breaking.

She leaned forward.

> ‚ÄúTell the ghost girl I remember her.‚Äù



She bought a pack of gum with a crisp $2 bill that bled slightly when I touched it.

I put the change in Register Two‚Äôs box and wrote:

> ‚ÄúBleeding bill. Glamoured customer. May be fae?‚Äù



When I looked outside, she was standing across the road, perfectly still, facing the woods.

She stayed that way until exactly midnight.
Then she was gone.


---

1:40 AM

I restocked the cooler. I made sure to use the same door going in and out. But the floor inside started sweating.

I froze.

Then remembered the torn note from last night:

> ‚ÄúIF THE FLOORS START SWEATING, STAY ON THE MATS.‚Äù



I stuck to the black anti-slip mats. Got the stock in. Didn‚Äôt slip once. Didn‚Äôt touch the wet tile.
I swear I heard something giggling from the Sprite shelf.
Didn‚Äôt look.

When I came out, Lila was waiting.

She picked up the biscuit. Ate it slow. Eyes not leaving mine.

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go back in there tonight,‚Äù she whispered.



Then she held out a crumpled note. Faded ink. Different handwriting.

I opened it carefully.

> ‚ÄúIf they ask you to take inventory during a thunderstorm‚Äîsay no. Even if there‚Äôs no storm outside.‚Äù
‚ÄîK



Another forgotten rule. Another breadcrumb.

I asked Lila softly, ‚ÄúDid K‚Ä¶ make it out?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer. She looked toward the freezer, then disappeared.

After Shift ‚Äì 6:02 AM

The lights snapped back to daytime brightness. The tile dried. The air went flat again‚Äîdead normal.

The morning manager shuffled in, eyes sunken, shaking hands clutching coffee.

I tried to hand him the new rule.

He flinched when I touched him. Then, slowly, accepted the note. Folded it twice.
Slipped it into the back of his wallet. Behind the cash.

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave them behind,‚Äù he whispered.



‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThem,‚Äù he repeated. ‚ÄúThe others. They might be watching you now.‚Äù



Then he handed me a gift card for the coffee shop across the street.

> ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt quit.‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt say anything.

But I noticed the fae-looking woman‚Äôs $2 bill was still bleeding, slowly, inside Register Two‚Äôs drop box.

1lmxfbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lmxfbm/what_my_gamechanger_for_appetite_control_was/,What my gamechanger for appetite control was,"At first, it used to be downing diet soda, coffee, black tea, and a lot of gum. It would sometimes be going for a walk while listening to music, and other days, it would be playing video games. Bored/hedonistic eating (more like gluttony) was what kept fucking me over; whenever I felt bored or wanted the dopamine rush of eating something tasty, I'd reach for food. It also helped me to eat high-volume, lots of protein, etc., but...

What helped me the most was realizing that ultimately, no matter how strong the cravings/appetite might've been, all you have to do is just learn that it doesn't control you. You aren't a slave to food. You can live without needing to eat everything in your pantry to be happy, and in fact, that'll make you happier in the long-term than whatever short-term pleasure you'll get from overindulging.

Now, I don't feel the need to use so many other coping mechanisms (games, chugging diet drinks, going through packs of artificial sweeteners, etc.) to ward off an urge to binge/overeating. It helped me a lot to just learn that as big as my appetite might be, it doesn't have to influence my actions in any way. If I want to lose weight, I'll just reduce my intake, without giving a shit about how it'll affect my taste buds; if I want to bulk up and put on muscle, I'll just up my intake by a reasonable amount and not use my weight-lifting sessions to justify an *unreasonable* surplus.

This is what I remind myself each day to fully free myself from food obsession/addiction. And this mindset has helped me in just about every other part of my life.

Was married at 18, had a child at 19, divorced him at 25 (he was 11 years older than me, I know now üö© but I  was stupid  and young) 

Reconnected with my high school crush and moved in together at 27 (hes 1.5 yrs older than me) we had a baby almost 2 years ago.

I gained a bunch of weight (like you do when you grow a human in your body) and have already always had body image issues, body dysmorphic disorder specifically.  On antidepresants and other meds.
I've done a lot of work and have lost 31lbs as of today (YAY) I'm more than 1/3 towards my goal. 
I also read smut, lots of different kinds. 

He has gotten a great promotion, which has come with considerably more stress. He is also on antidepresants, but his seem to have done a number on his libido. He also suffers from substance use disorder, (alcoholic and smokes weed) high blood pressure, and untreated ADHD.  His antidepresants probably aren't the best ones for him, but it's better than nothing until he can talk about trying something else. 

I've been pretty sad for a while.  It feels like he doesn't want to touch me, be intimate at all.  The only exception is maybe once a month,  he will crawl into bed and try to initiate,  but he's always very drunk and high when it happens.  That makes me feel even worse,  like he can only stand being with me sexually if he's totally fucked up.  Here's when I should mention he spends almost every night on the couch. He says it's not intentional, but it feels like it. Especially since when I get up in the morning and start coffee, he will wake up and move to the bed, after I'm not in it anymore. 

I've told him about this stuff that makes me sad and he seems to understand,  but nothing ever changes.  
I'm not worried about infidelity,  we both experienced enough of that and there are no indications of anything like that happening. 

The sexually intimate part of our relationship has always been up and down, but I don't know what to do to try to make it better. 

I ordered a small personal wand today,  and I feel super guilty about it. I know that he masturbates occasionally, it's come up while we have talked about all this. That doesn't bother me, but it feels different if it's me doing it. 

I've also realized recently that I have some codependency issues and put everyone else's needs above my own,  which seems fine when it's the children's needs, but apparently it's kind of my whole thing.. 

I don't know what I'm even asking,  advice I guess? 
Do I tell him that I ordered a toy for myself? It wasn't expensive or anything.  
I don't lie about anything,  so if he asked,  obviously I would tell him.   I don't know about just offering that piece of information up.  Why bother if he isn't interested in having sex with me.  
Is it possible he would be intrigued and want to use it together? That seems like the kind of thing that happens in my books, but not in real life. 
Do I just wait and hope we can eventually get back to where we were good? 
I'm do awkward and I wish I was better at this. And communication in general. But especially when it involves sex. 

So, educate me I guess?

It seems so alien now,"It seemed so normal at the time.  I grew up on Long Island, and we would hitchhike to Jones beach all summer every summer.

In college on the weekends we would pick a college town somewhere in the NE to hang out for the weekend.     Show up.   Meet some college kids and sleep on the couches of the dorm lounge rooms.   There were no locks on dormitories back then.  You could live on the campus.

I would also hitchhike back and forth to Long Island to see my girlfriend on other weekends.

In my 20s I worked on oil crews all over the west, but would hitchhike home to LI for Xmas, then hitchhike back out west after.   Interstates.  Freeways cars and trucks.   Keeping the truckers awake by keeping them talking on the long drives across.

I had my self imposed hitchhiking rules.   Look harmless.   Like when someone stops ask 3 or 4 quick questions to get a feel for them before getting in the car.    When travelling with weed, never have it on you, but put it 20 feet in front of you so that you can pick it up on the way to the car.   Learn to drink any kind of coffee that is offered.

And keep people talking.  Even if they are dark and weird, getting them talking about their life gets them out of whatever dark world they were previously in.

1lmxcnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTSportsWriter/comments/1lmxcnp/top_news_boxing_bouts/,Top News: Boxing Bouts,"**The Wild, Wacky, and Slightly Delusional World of June 29 Boxing: A Summary for the Sleep-Deprived**  

Ah, June 29! The night when the *Honda Center* in Anaheim transforms into a circus of muscle, hubris, and questionable life choices. Let‚Äôs break down this ‚Äúmajor boxing evening‚Äù with the enthusiasm of someone who‚Äôs just been told they‚Äôre out of coffee.  

**Main Event: Jake Paul vs. Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr.**  
Because nothing says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made it‚Äù like a TikTok influiter fighting a former world champion in a sport that demands more from your fists than your Instagram captions. Paul, the guy who once made a living by being *unemployed*, now boasts 11 fights (1 loss, 7 KOs‚Äîbecause why not?). Opposite him stands Ch√°vez Jr., a man who‚Äôs had 54 fights and probably owns a dictionary. The bout is a clash of eras: TikTok vs. *The Ring Magazine*. And if you‚Äôre tuning in at 3 AM Kyiv time, kudos‚Äîyour circadian rhythm is either shattered or you‚Äôre a masochist.  

**Co-Headliner: H√©ctor Ram√≠rez vs. Yuniel Dorticos**  
Because why have one boring fight when you can have two? Ram√≠rez (47-1, 30 KOs) vs. Dorticos (27-2, 25 KOs) is the kind of matchup that makes you wonder if the promoters just threw darts at a list of boxers. Both men have KOs to spare, but let‚Äôs be real: the real drama is whether the crowd will boo the Cuban or the Mexican. Spoiler: They‚Äôll boo everyone.  

**DAZN‚Äôs Midnight Oil**  
DAZN, the streaming service that‚Äôs basically the Spotify of punches, will broadcast this chaos. For Kyiv viewers, that means sacrificing sleep for the chance to see Jake Paul try to punch his way out of a bad career decision. A true *investment* in your future.  

**Deontay Wilder‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Beginning‚Äù**  
The 39-year-old Wilder, fresh off a loss to Zhilei Zhang, knocked out Tyrrell Herndon in Round 7. His post-fight speech? A masterclass in self-delusion: ‚ÄúThis is a new beginning!‚Äù Sure, Deontay. By 2026, you‚Äôll probably be a beginning again. Again. Again.  

**Canelo vs. Crawford: The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm So Nice I‚Äôll Ignore That Shove‚Äù Saga**  
Canelo Alvarez and Terence Crawford are trading compliments like they‚Äôre at a TED Talk, not a fight that‚Äôs supposed to end in someone‚Äôs face being a canvas. Crawford claims he‚Äôs ‚Äúnever been this excited,‚Äù which is either genuine or the most convincing acting career of the 21st century. Meanwhile, UFC‚Äôs Dana White is busy cashing checks from Riyadh Season, because nothing says ‚Äúsports integrity‚Äù like Saudi money and Las Vegas tourism.  

**The Website That Knows Everything (And Wants Your Clicks)**  
Let‚Äôs not forget the unsung hero of this saga: *Sport.ua* and *vseprosport.ru*, the websites that promise ‚Äúfree predictions, interviews, and photos‚Äù while subtly implying you‚Äôll miss out on life if you don‚Äôt subscribe. Because nothing completes a boxing night like a side of ads for ‚Äúwinning bets‚Äù and ‚Äúup-to-date statistics‚Äù (aka, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not sure what we‚Äôre talking about either‚Äù).  

**In Summary**  
June 29 is a night where legends are made, egos are inflated, and sleep is sacrificed. Whether you‚Äôre cheering for a TikTok star, a fading giant, or just hoping someone gets knocked out so the whole thing ends faster, one thing‚Äôs certain: By morning, you‚Äôll regret every decision that led you here. But hey, at least the photos will be on *Sport.ua*.  

*Stay woke, stay broke, and bet responsibly‚Äîor don‚Äôt, because that‚Äôs how we all end up here.* ü•ä",1,1751144670.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Before Shift ‚Äì 8:13 PM

I came in early again. I‚Äôve started doing that more often. Something about being here during the day makes it feel‚Ä¶ less haunted. Less alive.

The lights don‚Äôt hum. The coffee doesn‚Äôt taste like dread. The ice machine actually just makes ice.

Rico was behind the counter again. He gave me a nod but didn‚Äôt make eye contact. That‚Äôs normal.

What wasn‚Äôt normal? The way he whispered:

> ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ do you ever hear the cooler talking back to itself?‚Äù



I blinked.

He didn‚Äôt elaborate.

Instead, he counted down his drawer like it was a bomb, not a register. I watched him pull out his car keys at exactly 9:47 PM and hover near the door, tapping one foot. Didn‚Äôt even wait for the minute hand to hit the top. He just looked at me and said:

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be late. Store doesn‚Äôt like being alone.‚Äù



Then he left without another word.

I took my usual spot behind the counter and ate a cold dinner. I brought chili this time‚Äîthe good kind, homemade with cornbread chunks. I left a portion on a paper plate near the impulse rack with a new candy offering: licorice twists dipped in vanilla sugar.

Lila didn‚Äôt appear yet, but the temperature dropped a degree or two.

I took that as a thank you.


---

Shift Proper ‚Äì 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM

The second the clock struck 10:00 PM, the store breathed in.

That‚Äôs the only way I can describe it. Everything tensed, like walls that had been pretending all day could finally exhale their secrets.

It was going to be a bad night. I felt it in my teeth.

10:21 PM

I knocked a bottled tea off a shelf in Aisle 3. When I bent down to grab it, I noticed something underneath the gondola shelving‚Äîa sliver of paper curled under the metal.

I pulled it out. A torn half-sheet. Old. Yellowed. Scrawled in pencil, all caps:

> ""IF THE FLOORS START SWEATING, STAY ON THE MATS.""
‚ÄîK



I don‚Äôt know who ‚ÄúK‚Äù is.
But I believe them.

I checked the floor tiles. Nothing. For now.

12:08 AM

The Slurpee machine whined.

Again.

Not red this time‚Äîthank whatever unknowable entity watches me. But the sound it made was off. Like it was shivering. Crying, almost.

I unplugged it, then plugged it back in. The red nozzle pulsed for a second‚Ä¶ then died.

I left a sticky note:

> ‚ÄúFix me during the day, I‚Äôm done playing exorcist.‚Äù



2:44 AM

Lila appeared, hands clasped behind her back. She didn‚Äôt go for the candy this time‚Äîjust drifted toward the chili. Sniffed.

She looked up at me.

And then, in a voice like fog on glass, she whispered:

> ‚ÄúHe left a rule in the freezer.‚Äù



I blinked. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

But she was already gone.

I opened the walk-in freezer, half-expecting a body.

Instead, I found a note sealed in frost, taped under the metal shelf.

I had to thaw it with the heat gun from the tool drawer.

Once legible, it read:

> ""IF YOU HEAR A BABY CRYING, IT‚ÄôS NOT A BABY. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR.""
‚ÄîK



It wasn‚Äôt even part of the original rules list. This was older. Forgotten.

Maybe there were others. Maybe people left them like breadcrumbs, hoping the next fool would listen.

I wrote them both down and taped them inside the cabinet near the black phone.

> The old rules matter. Maybe more than the new ones.




---

After Shift ‚Äì 6:04 AM

The lights flickered back to their normal brightness like nothing ever happened. Like the store put its mask back on.

The morning manager arrived, holding coffee and clutching his keys like a rosary.

He looked pale. Sweaty. Like he hadn‚Äôt slept.

I told him I found another rule.

He stared at me, then whispered:

> ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù



I told him: the freezer.

He swallowed and said, even quieter:

> ‚ÄúThey told me never to go in there after dark. I used to think it was a joke. I don‚Äôt anymore.‚Äù



I handed him the copy of the two notes I transcribed.
He didn‚Äôt even look at them‚Äîjust folded the paper, tucked it into his pocket, and handed me another envelope.

> ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt quit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lasting longer than the others.‚Äù



I asked him who the others were.

He shook his head.

> ‚ÄúIf I say their names, something listens.‚Äù



He left it at that.

Just another morning at the store that pretends it doesn‚Äôt open overnight.

Fasting for health and weight loss (maybe autophagy to help with some loose skin). Aim 21 day water and electrolyte Fast. Normal routine ADF or 72 hrs rolling fasts. Longest fast has been a 12 day fast. 

Current day 7/21: weight lost so far 8 pounds but not counting it a like all water and will come back by day 2 if refeed. 

I work a desk job and come home only to continue working from my bed. I'm moving very little, sometimes under 1,000 steps a day, and I'm starting to feel the toll. The exhaustion is real, and I'm worried about muscle atrophy from both fasting and being almost completely sedentary.

On top of that, I've done something I‚Äôm not proud of. For the past two days, I‚Äôve chewed and spat out some protein-based food (like meatballs). I didn‚Äôt swallow anything, but I know even that might signal the body to halt autophagy. Today, I also had about 6 or 7 tablespoons of a West African broth (pepper soup), which is made from meat, onions and tomatoes, but I only drank the liquid.

Now I feel like I‚Äôve broken the fast without any of the emotional or physical relief that comes from actually eating. And worse, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve stopped autophagy and won‚Äôt even get the cellular repair benefits I‚Äôve been pushing so hard for.

So my questions are:

Have I undone all the benefits of my fast with these tiny slip-ups?

Am I actually damaging my body with this inactivity plus extreme fasting?

What can I do now to protect my muscles and still get something meaningful out of this fast?


I‚Äôm not new to fasting. I feel ok, tired but nothing a nap and electrolytes and coffee wont solve. I think the battle is psychological. Any encouragement, experience, or science would be really appreciated. I really feel I am letting my self down.

Thanks for reading. Be gentle, I already feel like I‚Äôm breaking down.

TLDR: Long fast, water-only fasting, and trying to reach autophagy. Struggling with low movement, exhaustion, and fears of muscle loss. New-ish to fasting but doing my best to learn. Needing advice and support after a few setbacks. Mentally tired, physically drained, and just hoping I haven‚Äôt undone all the work.",1,1751144486.0,fasting,3,0.99,False
1lmx9k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1lmx9k6/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

The moment Azi drinks the coffee he is a bit happier towards Metatron, and the joy of heaven only grows.

# How to Actually Win at Chick-fil-A (Without Going Broke)

Okay, real talk ‚Äì I'm obsessed with Chick-fil-A, but I'm also cheap. Like, really cheap. So over the years, I've basically turned ordering at this place into an art form. I've figured out how to get all the good stuff without feeling like I need to take out a second mortgage just to eat some chicken.

You know that feeling when you're craving that perfect Chick-fil-A menu experience, but then you see the total on the screen and your soul leaves your body? Yeah, we're gonna fix that. I'm about to teach you everything I wish someone had told me before I spent way too much money learning these lessons the hard way.

Whether you're a broke college kid surviving on ramen (been there), or you just don't want to spend $15 on what should be a $8 meal, these tricks are gonna change your life. Plus, you'll look like you actually know what you're doing instead of standing there staring at the menu like a deer in headlights.

# The Ugly Truth About Chick-fil-A Pricing (Spoiler: Location Matters A LOT)

Alright, prepare yourself for some news that's gonna hurt. Not every Chick-fil-A is created equal, and some locations are basically legal robbery.

# Theme Park Prices Will Make You Cry

So here's a fun story that'll make you want to pack your own lunch forever. I went to Cedar Point last summer (mistake number one), and decided to grab my usual Chick-fil-A meal. Big mistake. HUGE mistake. That sandwich meal that normally costs me like $12? They wanted $18 for it. Eighteen dollars! For the exact same food!

Turns out, theme park locations charge about 44% more than regular stores. The sandwich alone was 29% more expensive, but those meal deals? That's where they really get you. They know you're trapped in there with limited options, and they're gonna milk it for all it's worth.

Airport locations are just as bad. I've learned to eat before I travel or I'll end up spending more on one meal than my entire flight cost. It's actually ridiculous.

# Why Combo Meals Are Kind of a Scam

Here's something that blew my mind when I figured it out ‚Äì those combo meals everyone orders? They're basically designed to separate you from your money. The real profit isn't in that delicious chicken sandwich; it's in those waffle fries and that drink you probably don't even finish.

Think about it. How many times have you thrown away half your fries or left that drink sitting there? Meanwhile, you just paid an extra $4 for stuff you didn't even want. The Chick-fil-A food items in those combos are marked up like crazy compared to ordering them separately.

I started just ordering the sandwich, and guess what? I'm usually perfectly full, and I've got extra money in my pocket. Revolutionary stuff, right?

# My Secret Arsenal of Money-Saving Tricks

Okay, here's where I share all my best-kept secrets. These tricks have probably saved me hundreds of dollars over the years, and they're stupid easy to do.

# Trick #1: Just Get the Main Event

This is the big one, folks. Stop getting combo meals. Just order that beautiful chicken sandwich and call it a day. You'll save $3-4 every single time, and honestly? That sandwich is perfection all by itself. If you're still hungry (which you probably won't be), you can always add something small later.

# Trick #2: Sharing is Caring (and Cheaper)

If you're with friends or family, order one large thing to share instead of everyone getting their own sides. Those large waffle fries? They're basically enough for three people anyway. Same with nuggets ‚Äì get a large order and split it. Your wallet will thank you, and you won't feel like you're gonna explode from eating too much.

# Trick #3: That App is Actually Worth It

I used to be one of those people who refused to download restaurant apps because I thought they were dumb. Boy, was I wrong. The Chick-fil-A app gives you reward points that turn into free food. FREE FOOD, people! Plus, sometimes they have app-exclusive deals that you can't get anywhere else.

# Trick #4: Water is Your Best Friend

Look, I know their lemonade is legendary and their milkshakes look amazing, but drinks are where these places make their money. Switch to water and you'll save $2-3 every visit. If you absolutely need flavor, bring one of those little water enhancer packets. Problem solved, money saved.

# Customization Magic: Making Your Order Perfect

This is where Chick-fil-A really shines, and most people have no idea how flexible they are. You can basically customize anything, and it's awesome.

# Sandwich Upgrades That'll Change Your Life

**Cheese Game:** Don't settle for boring chicken when you can add cheese! They've got American, Colby Jack, and Pepper Jack. That Pepper Jack on a spicy sandwich? *Chef's kiss* It's like $0.50 extra and totally worth it.

**Pickle Situation:** If you're a pickle person like me, ask for extra. They'll load you up for free. If you hate pickles (we can't be friends, but I respect your choice), they'll leave them off. Easy peasy.

**Mayo Mystery:** Fun fact ‚Äì mayo doesn't come on the sandwiches automatically. You gotta ask for it. But here's the pro tip: get it on the side so you can control how much you use. Game changer.

**Chicken Swaps:** Feeling healthy? Swap fried for grilled. Feeling rebellious? Go the other way. They don't care, and neither should you.

**Bacon Makes Everything Better:** Add bacon to literally anything. Your life will improve immediately.

# Salad Hacks for the Health-Conscious

**Dressing Control:** Always get dressing on the side. You'll use way less, and you can mix flavors like some kind of salad scientist. Try Ranch + Creamy Salsa ‚Äì trust me on this one.

**Build Your Own Adventure:** Add stuff, remove stuff, go crazy. Want extra bacon? Done. Hate corn? Gone. It's like adult Legos, but edible.

# Drink Hacks That'll Blow Your Mind

**Lemonade Intensity Control:** Their lemonade is STRONG. Like, pucker-your-face-and-question-your-life-choices strong. Ask for it half-and-half with water if you want to keep your taste buds.

**Secret Menu Drinks:** The ""Chick-fil-A Shirley Temple"" isn't on the menu, but most places will make it. Half Sprite, half Hi-C, splash of Cherry Coke. It's like being eight years old again, but in the best way.

**Arnold Palmer Life:** The Sunjoy is officially on the menu now, but you can still custom-order your own mix. I like mine with more lemonade because I'm apparently a masochist.

**Ice Hack:** Ask for light ice and get way more actual drink. This is especially clutch with the expensive specialty stuff.

**Coffee Upgrade:** If you're into iced coffee, ask them to make it with shake base instead of milk. It's creamier and tastes fancy.

# Sauce Strategy for Beginners

First-timers, listen up ‚Äì you can literally ask to try every sauce before you order. Don't be shy! Each one is different, and finding your favorite is like finding your soulmate, but for food.

# The Mac & Cheese Nugget Hack

This should be on the menu but isn't ‚Äì order nuggets with buffalo sauce and mix them into the mac & cheese. It's like the adult version of chicken nugget mac and cheese from when you were a kid, and it's absolutely amazing.

# How to Order Like You Actually Know What You're Doing

# Use That App, Seriously

Mobile ordering is the way to go. You can take your time customizing without holding up the line, you don't have to repeat yourself to the cashier, and you can just walk in and grab your food like some kind of fast-food wizard.

# Timing is Everything

Breakfast ends at 10:30 AM most places, and honestly, that's where the real value is. Those chicken biscuits are filling and way cheaper than lunch stuff. If you're trying to save money, become a breakfast person.

# Questions Everyone Asks (But Is Too Embarrassed to Google)

**Do theme parks really charge more for Chick-fil-A?** Oh honey, yes. Like 30-45% more. It's painful. Eat before you go or pack snacks. Your future self will thank you.

**How do I save money without feeling like I'm missing out?** Just order the main thing you want, share large sides, use that app religiously, and drink water. You'll still get all the good stuff, just smarter.

**Can I really customize everything?** Pretty much! Add cheese, remove pickles, swap chicken types, create weird drink combos ‚Äì they're usually cool with whatever you want. The worst they can say is no, but they almost never do.

**What's the best way to try new stuff without going broke?** Ask for sauce samples, share specialty drinks with friends, or get the smallest size of new things. The frosted drinks are especially worth trying in small sizes first.

# The Real Talk: You Can Have Your Chicken and Eat It Too

Look, Chick-fil-A doesn't have to cost you your firstborn child. With these tricks, you can get all your favorite stuff without that buyer's remorse afterward. The secret is just being smart about it ‚Äì know where you're ordering, what you're ordering, and how to make it exactly what you want.

Next time you're having a Chick-fil-A craving, remember this stuff. Order just the sandwich, customize it perfectly, grab some water, and feel good about the fact that you just saved enough money to come back again next week. That's what I call living your best life.

Suntory isn‚Äôt just a beverage company. It‚Äôs a cultural institution. Founded in 1899 in Osaka, it began as a wine importer and evolved into a multi-billion-dollar conglomerate spanning whisky, soft drinks, health beverages, and wellness. Today, Suntory owns an expansive portfolio, including flagship brands like:

* **Yamazaki, Hibiki, Hakushu** \- iconic Japanese whiskies
* **Beam, Maker‚Äôs Mark, Laphroaig** \- acquired through Beam Suntory
* **BOSS Coffee** \- a ready-to-drink phenomenon across Asia
* **Suntory Tennensui** \- Japan‚Äôs most trusted bottled water
* **Ribena, Lucozade, Orangina** \- global soft drink licences (some sold or scaled back)

Its global reach is undeniable. But its emotional reach? Less certain. Over the last 10 years, Suntory has refined its brand systems and storytelling with discipline, but the marketing effectiveness across diverse audiences reveals a mixed picture.

The STAR Framework reveals how. By assessing the brand‚Äôs alignment with four core mindsets - Socialiser, Thinker, Adventurer, and Realist - we can pinpoint how Suntory earns trust, where it creates emotional distance, and how to unlock deeper loyalty.

# Socialisers: Emotion Without Invitation

Missed opportunity: High-quality emotional storytelling, but low consumer participation

At first glance, Suntory seems Socialiser-friendly. Japanese campaigns often focus on harmony, beauty, and shared experience. The Hibiki brand name literally means ‚Äúresonance‚Äù. So why doesn‚Äôt it feel more emotionally magnetic outside Japan?

* The storytelling is elegant but distant. Ads are cinematic, respectful, and steeped in tradition ‚Äî but there‚Äôs little playfulness, few personal narratives, and very little invitation to participate.
* Social campaigns are underdeveloped. Compared to global brands like Absolut or Guinness, Suntory rarely runs storytelling campaigns on TikTok, Instagram, or participatory platforms where Socialisers thrive.
* Even Boss Coffee‚Äôs cult-like popularity in Japan isn‚Äôt echoed internationally. The Tommy Lee Jones ads are charming, but there‚Äôs no obvious way for consumers to join in, remix, or celebrate the experience.

Socialisers want to feel seen. They want warmth, presence, and the chance to belong to a brand‚Äôs community. Suntory makes them feel impressed, not included.

>

# Thinkers: Depth Without Hype

**Secondary strength: Thoughtful storytelling, premium logic, and integrity**

Thinkers crave detail, proof, and clarity. They want to understand the process behind the promise, and Suntory gives them a masterclass.

* **Whisky marketing is Thinker-aligned**: Brand videos show master blenders. Bottle labels describe water sources, distillation processes, and flavour profiles. There‚Äôs no fluff, just disciplined detail.
* **Beam Suntory corporate messaging** \- including annual sustainability reports and long-form featurettes, reflect transparency and a structure that Thinkers can evaluate.
* **Product hierarchy is clear**: Entry-level vs rare editions are well-signposted. Limited releases are contextualised with distillery heritage, not just buzz.

The challenge? Outside whisky and Japanese domestic brands, Thinker alignment becomes diluted. Boss Coffee, Orangina, even health drinks like Iyemon or Suntory‚Äôs green tea variants are marketed in ways that feel broad, bright, and functional, rather than intellectually compelling.

>

# Adventurers: Momentum Without Magic

**Weakest alignment: Innovation exists, but excitement is underpowered**

This is Suntory‚Äôs blind spot. The Adventurer mindset is all about curiosity, momentum, and bold identity shifts. Adventurers ask: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new? What‚Äôs next? What breaks the rules?‚Äù

Suntory, despite its vast innovation pipeline, rarely speaks to them directly.

* **The product innovation is excellent.** Limited-edition whiskies, unusual packaging, flavour combinations, water + health crossover products - these would appeal hugely to Adventurers.
* **But the campaigns rarely thrill.** Most launches are announced quietly, with understated design and tone. Global ads feel cautious. There‚Äôs little risk, little rebellion, and no chaos - all qualities Adventurers actively seek.
* **Beam Suntory‚Äôs US portfolio** does show flickers of potential. The *Highball Hour* concept, aimed at Gen Z and young professionals, suggests an openness to disruption. But it still feels constrained by legacy aesthetics.

Adventurers aren‚Äôt anti-tradition, they just want to feel like they‚Äôre discovering something with forward motion. Right now, Suntory‚Äôs marketing doesn‚Äôt move fast enough to keep up with them.

>

# Realists: Built for Trust

**Primary strength: Stability, clarity, and long-term credibility**

This is where Suntory excels. For Realists, who value consistency, clarity, and low-risk decision-making, Suntory is a near-perfect brand.

* **Suntory Tennensui (natural mineral water)** builds trust through crystal-clear packaging, detailed water source stories, and consistent quality. Japanese Realists value reliability above novelty ‚Äî and Suntory delivers.
* **Boss Coffee** has achieved something few convenience brands manage: long-term loyalty through dependable product experience, near-ubiquitous availability, and familiar branding.
* **Yamazaki and Hibiki** win here too. Even at a premium level, the emphasis on ageing, craftsmanship, and tradition reassures Realists that these aren‚Äôt hype-driven products, but reliable investments.
* **Environmental messaging** \- from the Institute for Water Science to ‚ÄúMizu to Ikiru‚Äù (‚Äúliving with water‚Äù), speaks directly to Realist values. It‚Äôs not flashy CSR. It‚Äôs methodical stewardship, communicated with gravitas.

Realists don‚Äôt want to be dazzled. They want to feel safe. Suntory earns that safety through design, process, and a voice that never over-promises.

>

# STAR Summary Table

|Mindset|Appeal Strength|Observations|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Realist|‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ|Deeply aligned: calm, consistent, credible|
|Thinker|‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ|Strong in premium lines, needs broader consistency|
|Socialiser|‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ|Emotionally elegant but not participatory|
|Adventurer|‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ|Innovation present, energy lacking|

**Dominant appeal:** Realist / Thinker  
**Current gaps:** Socialiser and Adventurer  
**Future opportunity:** Unlock play, momentum, and community

# Strategic Recommendations

**1. Reframe Global Campaigns to Spark Broader Mindset Appeal**  
Move beyond product storytelling. Create emotionally rich, psychologically diverse campaigns. Invite Socialisers and Adventurers to *feel*, not just observe.

**2. Activate Adventurer Energy Through High-Concept Collaboration**  
Limited-edition runs and design-forward packaging deserve campaigns to match. Explore co-branding with avant-garde creatives, cultural icons, or disruptive digital formats.

**3. Make Belonging Visible**  
For Socialisers, build relationship capital: create digital communities, shared rituals (e.g. highball hours, tasting journeys), and celebration of customer voices. Let them be seen, not just sold to.

**4. Consolidate and Simplify**  
Too many sub-brands with region-specific marketing risks diluting clarity. Create a more unified narrative system, one that Thinkers can navigate, Realists can trust, and Socialisers can belong to.

**5. Experiment More Publicly**  
The innovation is happening. Now show it off. Create experimental sub-labels, R&D showcases, or ‚Äúbeta drop‚Äù launch formats. Show Adventurers that this brand still plays.

# Closing Reflection

**Suntory** has built its legacy on care, craftsmanship, and consistency. It has earned the loyalty of Realists and the admiration of Thinkers. But in a world that demands more emotion, more dynamism, and more shared meaning, that‚Äôs no longer enough.

To evolve from admired to adored, from respected to beloved, Suntory must open up.

It must speak more warmly. Move more boldly. Invite more freely.

Because the brands that lead the next decade won‚Äôt just offer quality.

They‚Äôll offer energy, identity, and a place to belong.

Ethiopia is one of the oldest christian nations and coffee comes from there so as an alternative coffee may be exported to be grown in other places in Africa and exported to christian nations (so Britain may be obsessed with coffee instead of tea).

Tobacco comes from the new world and since we didn't colonize the America's we wouldn't have access to it ... however we know hashshashins exist which is where we get the assassins from but they're named after hash which comes from marijuana so... instead of cigarettes and chewing tobacco Europe and Islamic countries would have access to joints and edibles.

Since Britain will keep the north sea relatively safe when compared to the Mediterranean fishing may be safe enough to do there so for the British isles and France so fish like cod, mackerel, halibut, haddock, eels, sharks and wales may be common and often preserved by smoking, drying or salting. We may also have access to fish sauces. Obviously we would still have pigs, cows, goats, horses, chicken and sheep plus what can be hunted like rabbits or deer. Britain produced a lot of textiles and exported wool so mutton may be very common in Britain as a by product.

Flavours due to not colonizing the America's and trade with places like India being difficult may make food more medieval, not bland but very different. No potato's, corn, tomato's, chilies and the like will make food less spicy and a lot of staple crops for the poor will be limited which will make populations smaller and will cause an increased reliance on oats, barley, rye and wheat along with veg like turnips, carrots, cabbages and the like. 

Would we see victory gardens to help supplement peoples diets due to the war forcing the export of a lot of food? would bread be adulterated so make it go farther, would lent be followed more strictly so holy days cause a restriction on what people can eat which is enforced by the church which may increase the consumption of sea food and dairy alternatives like almond milk (almond milk is medieval).

Its different when im living with someone. Because thats OUR space, not mine, not theirs. I dont understand whats wrong with me.

- tomo x lil woody collab. After the killer crab roll they did last year I knew I had to get there early to get in line before it ran out. Actual serving was 2 sliders but I was too hungry to remember the photo til I killed one.

- el gran taco. Most disappointing one of the day, one chicken street taco for a $5 ticket, and it was pretty try. Was sad at the time but el gran still makes excellent food in their normal menu, just a miss for this event.

- slider and fries from farm boy burgers. With deference to Tomo‚Äôs offering (because it‚Äôs hard to rate startups vs Michelin star inspired dishes) this was my top bite of the day. This is the BEST smash burger and fries combo I‚Äôve had since moving to the PNW. We will be back soon and often

1lmwn0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1lmwn0d/24_years_of_toxicity/,24 Years of Toxicity,"I am making this post because I just feel like I want someone else out there to know what I've been through and the description of this group says that it's for when you just need someone to listen to you. I know I should have left a long time ago, I know I should probably leave now. I know he's toxic and terrible, I just need a record somewhere out there and it's not something you can tell friends or family.

  
My husband and I got together when I was 19 and he was 25. With almost a quarter of a century more life experience it is obvious to me now that there was something wrong with a 25 year old divorced father of one to want a relationship with a naive 19 year old, but at the time I had never had a boyfriend and I was thrilled to have the attention of someone who I found attractive physically and personality wise. I honestly didn't think of him as older but as a peer. Which was really part of the problem. I saw him occasionally use drugs but I didn't think much of it because I thought of him as a peer and society says it's not uncommon for college kids to experiment a little. I didn't think this wasn't a college kid but an adult in their mid twenties.

For the first 5 years we were poor but happy, we spent all our time together and would go out exploring the world and just have fun. But even then there were signs that I just didn't pick up on. I've always been completely open to any sexual experience he wants and around the age of 21 we got on a porn website that lets you share webcams with other users and we had sex on cam. Later I found out that he had been getting on the cam without me and showing off his dick. I was ok with it but felt that if that's the kind of relationship he wanted then I should be able to get on their and perform solo too. But when he found out he flipped out and said he was leaving. I had to physically block the door, desperately gripping the door jamb in tears as he tried to force his way through too keep him from leaving. ¬†In retrospect it is an early sign of his selfishness, double standards and abusive behavior. My life would have been so much better if I had just let him go.

 By the time I was 24 he was totally strung out on methadone. If he wasn't at work he would sit on the couch and nod. Nothing I did could get him to sleep with me or do things with me. We lived in a 4 room shack that had no insulation. You could look through the floorboards in one room and see the ground outside. It had one window unit for air and a portable kerosene heater in the kitchen for heat. I should have left then but I was still in love and convinced that if I just stayed then things would eventually get better. Vows are for better or worse and better would come again. I would think of The Offspring's song, Self Esteem, that says ""The more you suffer the more it shows you really care"" and it would give me strength to keep going. (Yes, I am now aware that the song was describing a toxic relationship and saying how you shouldn't stay). All our money went to his drug habit and I would pay the bills with credit cards.

By 26 I was severely depressed. Between his drugs and my depression no one would let the pets out to use the bathroom. They would go to the bathroom in the house and then no one would clean it up. The carpets were ruined with pee; poop would remain there until it had dried out and turned white. The house had black mold and I got bronchitis. Because we were poor and had no insurance, I refused to go to the doctor for a long time. By the time I broke down and went to Urgent Care they said that I had severe scarring of the lungs and my lung capacity has never been what it was prior to that.¬†I should have left then but I was in school and working a part time minimum wage job and didn't think I could make it alone on that kind of income. 

At 27 I had what I have since come to understand is called an emotional affair. Emotional affairs aren't physical but you become emotionally close with someone outside of the relationship with your significant other, often at the expense of emotional closeness with your partner. A male coworker became a close friend like this. I wasn't interested in anything physical but we'd hang out together and he acted like I was someone worth talking too, which my husband hadn't done in years. I recognize that it was wrong of me but also recognize my vulnerability and that I didn't understand at the time what it was or that it was wrong. I just knew about physically cheating on someone and I wasn't doing that. I wanted to believe that it was ok for males and females to be friends. And they can, but you have to have a healthy primary relationship first. Eventually my husband got jealous and put an end to the friendship.

At 29 because I was so depressed and didn't see a way out I attempted suicide via pills. I told my dad how depressed and suicidal I was but he had gotten strung out on cocaine after his fianc√© had died of cancer and couldn't help me.

At 30 I finally got a full time job making $17 an hour. Again, I should have left at this point but didn't. My husband also got a new job and we moved into a better house. I had wanted kids since I was 25 but knew that we were so poor and with a drug addict husband it wouldn't be right. But now the biological clock was ticking and we were in a better living condition so I gave up on him getting clean first and started begging for sex so we could have a kid. Yes, I know it was wrong and selfish of me. My husband said that the drugs killed his libido and would only have sex with me about twice a year and only on his terms so I never managed to pregnant.

At 34 he finally went to rehab for three weeks. Every year his employer rents out Six Flags for one day for the employees and it happened to fall on the weekend after he got back from rehab. We went and when we got home I went in the house while he said he was going to sit in the car and listen to the football game on the radio (The only TV option we had was Netflix). The next morning he asked me to make an appointment for him with the urologist. I did so and picked up his phone to enter the appointment into his Google Calendar with a reminder so he wouldn‚Äôt miss it. When I did so the last app that he had open popped up. It was a text conversation he was having with a girl from his work. It said that she should be his sugar mama but that she didn‚Äôt need to pay him for his services. My stomach bottomed out. The latest texts had started on our way home from Six Flags, with me sitting right next to him in the car. He had sent her a kiss emoji and told her she had looked pretty (when we got to Six Flags he had made a B line for a girl I now knew to be her. She had asked where he had been the past three weeks and he had said he would tell her about it later before we went our separate ways).  I started looking further through the texts and found that they went back six months. He told her she was sexy, had a nice ass, sent heart-eyed emojis and kisses, etc. When confronted he played dumb, when shown the texts he said they were only friends and it had never gotten physical. I demanded the friendship end. When he did nothing, I texted her on his Facebook account, letting her know who I was and what I had found and how wrong it was for her, knowing he was married, to let him talk to her like that. Then I unfriended her. Slowly, we tried to move past it, but my trust was broken.

Now that my husband was clean and not focused on his coworker, we started having sex again. I managed to get pregnant but at 3 months along I had a miscarriage. I started bleeding on a Friday and went to the gynecologist who told me the fetus no longer had a heartbeat. They said they could give me some drugs to speed up the process or I could pass it naturally. I elected to let it pass naturally even though I had to work that weekend. I was doing my best to hide my pain but had reached the point of giving up and telling my boss I had to go home sick. I decided to go to the bathroom one last time before making the drive home. Finally, the fetus came in the bathroom at work. A few months later I was pregnant again, and again the pregnancy terminated in a spontaneous abortion at 3 months. This time I opted to accept Misoprostol to speed up the process from the doctor, I was able to stay home and pass the fetus in the shower in peace.

One night about a year after my husband got out of rehab, we went to a strip club. It was our second time going to the strip club. The first time was early in our relationship. We had a fun time. My husband gave me money to give to the girls and he watched me interact. I felt involved, like I was what was turning him on. This second trip was not fun at all. He wanted to be the one interacting with the girls, sitting at the stage. His grandmother, who had raised him, had just passed and he had done some drugs and was drinking away the pain of the loss. When someone else at the club tried to take video of a dancer, she responded by giving them the finger and then burying my husbands face in her tits. He didn‚Äôt give the girls money the way you are supposed to, but in a way that allowed him to rub on their muff. At one point he said he was going to get a drink from the bar and then disappeared for 15 minutes. Eventually he said he wanted to leave and go to a more upscale club. We left, and I drove us to where Google Maps said the club would be, but couldn‚Äôt find the club. After driving around the block a couple times I decided I was ready to give up and started home. My husband grabbed the wheel and started jerking us all over the road because he wasn‚Äôt ready to give up. I was worried he would cause a wreck or the erratic swerving would get the attention of a cop so after wrestling a few moments I thumped his arm to get him to let go. He let go and then punched me in the arm back. When we got home I left him in the car and locked all the doors. When he woke up he tried to crawl in the window. I fought him off and called his brother to come and pick him up. He slept it off at his brothers that night and came home contrite the next morning. But he had fallen off the wagon and the drug use was back on.

The incident with his coworker, the pregnancy losses, and the restarting of drug use had taken its toll and we started fighting with more frequency. He regularly chose to sleep on the couch. The night before I had to go out of town on a business trip we had one of our regular fights. Every night while I was away he went out to the bar with a female coworker. After spending hours at the bar they would call each other and have half hour long phone conversations. My husband refused to answer any of my texts all week long and when asked why when I returned he said it was because we had a fight before I had left (My husband is always telling me to not hold grudges so this reasoning was very out of character for him). Once I‚Äôm back in town he continues to go to the bar every night with his coworker. She sends my husband a picture of her laying on the bed in her underwear with the caption ‚ÄúJust got out of the shower.‚Äù She also sends him a sound clip from a song. The lyrics are ‚ÄúGirl getting over him and I‚Äôm getting over her. The eyes have it made, ain‚Äôt gotta say a word. Misery loves company, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs you and me.¬† Buying each other drinks, back at the bar, thick as thieves. Stealing these little sips. Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it. Keep playing them songs, keep singing along, keep leaning it on in closer.‚Äù My husband texts his coworker asking her to come play Fortnite with him. She responds that she doesn‚Äôt play Fortnite. He tells her to come anyway so he can talk to her. Again, when confronted, he denies anything untoward has happened. The constant lies about girls and about buying drugs erode any trust I have in him. I start looking at his phone constantly, trying to discern the truth since I can no longer believe anything he says.

Over the next few years there is a lot of fighting. I‚Äôm angry about the years I‚Äôve sacrificed, the drug use, the lies. I‚Äôm angry about the fact that every time I try to talk about how he has hurt me over the years or how he‚Äôs hurting me now he ignores me or belittles my feelings. He‚Äôs mad about how I don‚Äôt trust him, how I look at his phone or get up in the middle of the night to see what he‚Äôs doing on the computer or if he‚Äôs at a bar instead of coming home after work. We fight about how much time he spends with friends and how much porn he watches. I say that I waited a decade for him to get clean and when he went to rehab he didn‚Äôt come back to me, he now chooses staying up all night playing video games with friends or going out to bars after work with friends and doesn‚Äôt get up to spend time with me. I say that after a decade of constantly being turned down sexually, with him blaming it on drugs, I now need him to choose me instead of porn. He always ignores me or says I am wrong to be bothered by these things and I should just get over it. We have several fights where he chokes me and grabs me by the hair. When he does this I let my body go limp and he drags me through the house. I repeatedly tell him I want him to move out. Because he never listens when I am talking about our problems and I am getting desperate I start doing things like standing in front of the TV and blocking his view. One time I threw some of his clothes outside in an attempt to encourage him to move out. Both of us are handling things wrong, we are growing super toxic.

One night he comes home from being at a bar after work. He has done a large amount of different drugs and is completely smashed. I tell him that I am done, that I want him out. This time he takes it seriously enough that he says he‚Äôll go to rahab. I relent about him moving out and he does another stint in rehab. It doesn‚Äôt solve our problems. He uses the stint in rehab to kick opiates but immediately starts doing other drugs as soon as he‚Äôs out. He also goes right back to hanging out at bars instead of coming home after work. He says he feels like he‚Äôs in prison. He says I have to let him be free. We have another blow up fight and this time I succeed in getting him to go to his sisters. We say it‚Äôs a separation, that maybe being apart will make him miss what he had, that if he works on wooing me and convinces me that he is invested in us again he can come back but over the next few days, while his clothes are at his sisters, he keeps coming back to our house and letting himself in to sleep on the couch after work. I keep telling him he doesn‚Äôt live here any more and he can‚Äôt do that, but he doesn‚Äôt stop, insisting that he has to because he‚Äôs about to fall asleep at the wheel. After 3 or 4 days of this he gets Covid and I let him move back in rather than let him bring Covid into his sisters house.

Another night I see him watching porn. At first I walk away, but then I come back. He has said that the correct response when I see him texting another girl is to not get mad, but ask for a threesome and when we were first together and in love we watched porn together so I decide that the correct response here is to ask if I can join him in his porn watching. He tells me he just wants to wack off by himself and then go to sleep. I let him know how his rejection is hurting me and then go to the bedroom and lock the door. The next day I try to talk about it with him. He does his standard belittling of my feelings and it escalates with me standing in front of the TV, telling him I want him out, telling him that since my asking him to move out doesn‚Äôt work, maybe I need to make him hate being here so he‚Äôll want to move out. I then hide his car keys. He demands the keys and when I don‚Äôt give them to him, he chokes me and jerks me around by the hair. He tells me he has thought about stabbing me. That night I wake up at 2am with my husband standing over the bed with a knife, he doesn't say anything for a long time. He finally demands his keys again and we tussle, he bends my finger and then stabs a box on the nightstand before leaving the room. I pack a duffel bag and go to his sister's house for the rest of the night.¬†

Yet another time when I tried to talk to him about his porn use/rejection of me he kicks me. I fall and hit the arm of a chair, it results in a black eye. My husband freaks out, saying that we have to hide it, that he can‚Äôt afford to miss work because he‚Äôs in trouble for battery. I point out that a side effect of drug abuse can be aggression (he's also started taking testosterone shots) and that is why he has put two holes in our walls, a hole in the coffee table, cracked a door, broke a nightstand and Roomba by kicking them and given me a black eye. He says he needs to stop taking them but he doesn‚Äôt. We buy some concealer and I hide the black eye until it fades after a few weeks.

At one point ¬†I discover that he has joined a Facebook group called ‚ÄúAffairs with no Strings Attached‚Äù he has also been texting prostitutes. When confronted, he plays dumb. When I show him the evidence he says that he must have joined accidentally and he doesn‚Äôt know how it happened. He says that he could cheat if he wanted to, but he doesn‚Äôt want to. He claims that he was texting prostitutes for both of us, to set up a threesome. But even though all four prostitutes ask him what ‚Äúservices‚Äù he‚Äôs looking for, he never mentions a threesome. He mentions ‚Äúwanting to fuck them‚Äù and handjobs. And the only time I am mentioned is when one of the girls asks how long he‚Äôll require their services and he says ‚ÄúNot sure. I‚Äôm nervous. LOL Been with the same woman for 20 years.‚Äù Which doesn‚Äôt tell them if I‚Äôm now dead, he‚Äôs divorced, or looking to cheat and it CERTAINLY doesn‚Äôt tell them I‚Äôd be involved. He also joins Ashley Madison.

There are many other instances of physical and verbal abuse. We haven't had a big blow up fight in three months. Hopefully that streak will last but I'm not naive enough to believe it will last another 40 years. I know I should leave but also know I probably never will. Anyway, thanks for giving me a place to write it all out.

1lmwjjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lmwjjd/the_ocean_at_the_end_of_the_lane/,The Ocean at the End of the Lane:,"¬†I wore a black suit and a white shirt, a black tie and black shoes, all polished and shiny: clothes that normally would make me feel uncomfortable, as if I were in a stolen uniform, or pretending to be an adult. Today they gave me comfort of a kind. I was wearing the right clothes for a hard day.  
  
¬† I had done my duty in the morning, spoken the words I was meant to speak, and I meant them as I spoke them, and then, when the service was done, I got in my car and I drove, randomly, without a plan, with an hour or so to kill before I met more people I had not seen for years and shook more hands and drank too many cups of tea from the best china. I drove along winding Sussex country roads I only half-remembered, until I found myself headed toward the town center, so I turned, randomly, down another road, and took a left, and a right. It was only then that I realized where I was going, where I had been going all along, and I grimaced at my own foolishness.  
  
¬† I had been driving toward a house that had not existed for decades.  
  
¬† I thought of turning around, then, as I drove down a wide street that had once been a flint lane beside a barley field, of turning back and leaving the past undisturbed. But I was curious.  
  
¬† The old house, the one I had lived in for seven years, from when I was five until I was twelve, that house had been knocked down and was lost for good. The new house, the one my parents had built at the bottom of the garden, between the azalea bushes and the green circle in the grass we called the fairy ring, that had been sold thirty years ago.  
  
¬† I slowed the car as I saw the new house. It would always be the new house in my head. I pulled up into the driveway, observing the way they had built out on the mid-seventies architecture. I had forgotten that the bricks of the house were chocolate-brown. The new people had made my mother‚Äôs tiny balcony into a two-story sunroom. I stared at the house, remembering less than I had expected about my teenage years: no good times, no bad times. I‚Äôd lived in that place, for a while, as a teenager. It didn‚Äôt seem to be any part of who I was now.  
  
¬† I backed the car out of their driveway.  
  
¬† It was time, I knew, to drive to my sister‚Äôs bustling, cheerful house, all tidied and stiff for the day. I would talk to people whose existence I had forgotten years before and they would ask me about my marriage (failed a decade ago, a relationship that had slowly frayed until eventually, as they always seem to, it broke) and whether I was seeing anyone (I wasn‚Äôt; I was not even sure that I could, not yet) and they would ask about my children (all grown up, they have their own lives, they wish they could be here today), work (doing fine, thank you, I would say, never knowing how to talk about what I do. If I could talk about it, I would not have to do it. I make art, sometimes I make true art, and sometimes it fills the empty places in my life. Some of them. Not all). We would talk about the departed; we would remember the dead.  
  
¬† The little country lane of my childhood had become a black tarmac road that served as a buffer between two sprawling housing estates. I drove further down it, away from the town, which was not the way I should have been traveling, and it felt good.  
  
¬† The slick black road became narrower, windier, became the single-lane track I remembered from my childhood, became packed earth and knobbly, bone-like flints.  
  
¬† Soon I was driving, slowly, bumpily, down a narrow lane with brambles and briar roses on each side, wherever the edge was not a stand of hazels or a wild hedgerow. It felt like I had driven back in time. That lane was how I remembered it, when nothing else was.  
  
¬† I drove past Caraway Farm. I remembered being just-sixteen, and kissing red-cheeked, fair-haired Callie Anders, who lived there, and whose family would soon move to the Shetlands, and I would never kiss her or see her again. Then nothing but fields on either side of the road, for almost a mile: a tangle of meadows. Slowly the lane became a track. It was reaching its end.  
  
¬† I remembered it before I turned the corner and saw it, in all its dilapidated red-brick glory: the Hempstocks‚Äô farmhouse.  
  
¬† It took me by surprise, although that was where the lane had always ended. I could have gone no further. I parked the car at the side of the farmyard. I had no plan. I wondered whether, after all these years, there was anyone still living there, or, more precisely, if the Hempstocks were still living there. It seemed unlikely, but then, from what little I remembered, they had been unlikely people.  
  
¬† The stench of cow muck struck me as I got out of the car, and I walked, gingerly, across the small yard to the front door. I looked for a doorbell, in vain, and then I knocked. The door had not been latched properly, and it swung gently open as I rapped it with my knuckles.  
  
¬† I had been here, hadn‚Äôt I, a long time ago? I was sure I had. Childhood memories are sometimes covered and obscured beneath the things that come later, like childhood toys forgotten at the bottom of a crammed adult closet, but they are never lost for good. I stood in the hallway and called, ‚ÄúHello? Is there anybody here?‚Äù  
  
¬† I heard nothing. I smelled bread-baking and wax furniture polish and old wood. My eyes were slow to adjust to the darkness: I peered into it, was getting ready to turn and leave when an elderly woman came out of the dim hallway holding a white duster. She wore her gray hair long.  
  
¬† I said, ‚ÄúMrs. Hempstock?‚Äù  
  
¬† She tipped her head to one side, looked at me. ‚ÄúYes. I do know you, young man,‚Äù she said. I am not a young man. Not any longer. ‚ÄúI know you, but things get messy when you get to my age. Who are you, exactly?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think  
I must have been about seven, maybe eight, the last time I was here.‚Äù  
  
¬† She smiled then. ‚ÄúYou were Lettie‚Äôs friend? From the top of the lane?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou gave me milk. It was warm, from the cows.‚Äù And then I realized how many years had gone by, and I said, ‚ÄúNo, you didn‚Äôt do that, that must have been your mother who gave me the milk. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù As we age, we become our parents; live long enough and we see faces repeat in time. I remembered Mrs. Hempstock, Lettie‚Äôs mother, as a stout woman. This woman was stick-thin, and she looked delicate. She looked like her mother, like the woman I had known as Old Mrs. Hempstock.  
  
¬† Sometimes when I look in the mirror I see my father‚Äôs face, not my own, and I remember the way he would smile at himself, in mirrors, before he went out. ‚ÄúLooking good,‚Äù he‚Äôd say to his reflection, approvingly. ‚ÄúLooking good.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you here to see Lettie?‚Äù Mrs. Hempstock asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs she here?‚Äù The idea surprised me. She had gone somewhere, hadn‚Äôt she? America?  
  
¬† The old woman shook her head. ‚ÄúI was just about to put the kettle on. Do you fancy a spot of tea?‚Äù  
  
¬† I hesitated. Then I said that, if she didn‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôd like it if she could point me toward the duck pond first.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDuck pond?‚Äù  
  
¬† I knew Lettie had had a funny name for it. I remembered that. ‚ÄúShe called it the sea. Something like that.‚Äù  
  
¬† The old woman put the cloth down on the dresser. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt drink the water from the sea, can you? Too salty. Like drinking life‚Äôs blood. Do you remember the way? You can get to it around the side of the house. Just follow the path.‚Äù  
  
¬† If you‚Äôd asked me an hour before, I would have said no, I did not remember the way. I do not even think I would have remembered Lettie Hempstock‚Äôs name. But standing in that hallway, it was all coming back to me. Memories were waiting at the edges of things, beckoning to me. Had you told me that I was seven again, I might have half-believed you, for a moment.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I walked into the farmyard. I went past the chicken coop, past the old barn and along the edge of the field, remembering where I was, and what was coming next, and exulting in the knowledge. Hazels lined the side of the meadow. I picked a handful of the green nuts, put them in my pocket.  
  
¬† The pond is next, I thought. I just have to go around this shed, and I‚Äôll see it.  
  
¬† I saw it and felt oddly proud of myself, as if that one act of memory had blown away some of the cobwebs of the day.  
  
¬† The pond was smaller than I remembered. There was a little wooden shed on the far side, and, by the path, an ancient, heavy, wood-and-metal bench. The peeling wooden slats had been painted green a few years ago. I sat on the bench, and stared at the reflection of the sky in the water, at the scum of duckweed at the edges, and the half-dozen lily pads. Every now and again, I tossed a hazelnut into the middle of the pond, the pond that Lettie Hempstock had called . . .  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt the sea, was it?  
  
¬† She would be older than I am now, Lettie Hempstock. She was only a handful of years older than I was back then, for all her funny talk. She was eleven. I was . . . what was I? It was after the bad birthday party. I knew that. So I would have been seven.  
  
¬† I wondered if we had ever fallen in the water. Had I pushed her into the duck pond, that strange girl who lived in the farm at the very bottom of the lane? I remembered her being in the water. Perhaps she had pushed me in too.  
  
¬† Where did she go? America? No, Australia. That was it. Somewhere a long way away.  
  
¬† And it wasn‚Äôt the sea. It was the ocean.  
  
¬† Lettie Hempstock‚Äôs ocean.  
  
¬† I remembered that, and, remembering that, I remembered everything.  
  
¬† I.  
  
¬† Nobody came to my seventh birthday party.  
  
¬† There was a table laid with jellies and trifles, with a party hat beside each place, and a birthday cake with seven candles on it in the center of the table. The cake had a book drawn on it, in icing. My mother, who had organized the party, told me that the lady at the bakery said that they had never put a book on a birthday cake before, and that mostly for boys it was footballs or spaceships. I was their first book.  
  
¬† When it became obvious that nobody was coming, my mother lit the seven candles on the cake, and I blew them out. I ate a slice of the cake, as did my little sister and one of her friends (both of them attending the party as observers, not participants) before they fled, giggling, to the garden.  
  
¬† Party games had been prepared by my mother but, because nobody was there, not even my sister, none of the party games were played, and I unwrapped the newspaper around the pass-the-parcel gift myself, revealing a blue plastic Batman figure. I was sad that nobody had come to my party, but happy that I had a Batman figure, and there was a birthday present waiting to be read, a boxed set of the Narnia books, which I took upstairs. I lay on the bed and lost myself in the stories.  
  
¬† I liked that. Books were safer than other people anyway.  
  
¬† My parents had also given me a Best of Gilbert and Sullivan LP, to add to the two that I already had. I had loved Gilbert and Sullivan since I was three, when my father‚Äôs youngest sister, my aunt, took me to see Iolanthe, a play filled with lords and fairies. I found the existence and nature of the fairies easier to understand than that of the lords. My aunt had died soon after, of pneumonia, in the hospital.  
  
¬† That evening my father arrived home from work and he brought a cardboard box with him. In the cardboard box was a soft-haired black kitten of uncertain gender, whom I immediately named Fluffy, and which I loved utterly and wholeheartedly.  
  
¬† Fluffy slept on my bed at night. I talked to it, sometimes, when my little sister was not around, half-expecting it to answer in a human tongue. It never did. I did not mind. The kitten was affectionate and interested and a good companion for someone whose seventh birthday party had consisted of a table with iced biscuits and a blancmange and cake and fifteen empty folding chairs.  
  
¬† I do not remember ever asking any of the other children in my class at school why they had not come to my party. I did not need to ask them. They were not my friends, after all. They were just the people I went to school with.  
  
¬† I made friends slowly, when I made them.  
  
¬† I had books, and now I had my kitten. We would be like Dick Whittington and his cat, I knew, or, if Fluffy proved particularly intelligent, we would be the miller‚Äôs son and Puss-in-Boots. The kitten slept on my pillow, and it even waited for me to come home from school, sitting on the driveway in front of my house, by the fence, until, a month later, it was run over by the taxi that brought the opal miner to stay at my house.  
  
¬† I was not there when it happened.  
  
¬† I got home from school that day, and my kitten was not waiting to meet me. In the kitchen was a tall, rangy man with tanned skin and a checked shirt. He was drinking coffee at the kitchen table, I could smell it. In those days all coffee was instant coffee, a bitter dark brown powder that came out of a jar.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I had a little accident arriving here,‚Äù he told me, cheerfully. ‚ÄúBut not to worry.‚Äù His accent was clipped, unfamiliar: it was the first South African accent I had heard.  
  
¬† He, too, had a cardboard box on the table in front of him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe black kitten, was he yours?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called Fluffy,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. Like I said. Accident coming here. Not to worry. Disposed of the corpse. Don‚Äôt have to trouble yourself. Dealt with the matter. Open the box.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWh  
at?‚Äù  
  
¬† He pointed to the box. ‚ÄúOpen it,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† The opal miner was a tall man. He wore jeans and checked shirts every time I saw him, except the last. He had a thick chain of pale gold around his neck. That was gone the last time I saw him, too.  
  
¬† I did not want to open his box. I wanted to go off on my own. I wanted to cry for my kitten, but I could not do that if anyone else was there and watching me. I wanted to mourn. I wanted to bury my friend at the bottom of the garden, past the green-grass fairy ring, into the rhododendron bush cave, back past the heap of grass cuttings, where nobody ever went but me.  
  
¬† The box moved.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBought it for you,‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúAlways pay my debts.‚Äù  
  
¬† I reached out, lifted the top flap of the box, wondering if this was a joke, if my kitten would be in there. Instead a ginger face stared up at me truculently.  
  
¬† The opal miner took the cat out of the box.  
  
¬† He was a huge, ginger-striped tomcat, missing half an ear. He glared at me angrily. This cat had not liked being put in a box. He was not used to boxes. I reached out to stroke his head, feeling unfaithful to the memory of my kitten, but he pulled back so I could not touch him, and he hissed at me, then stalked off to a far corner of the room, where he sat and looked and hated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere you go. Cat for a cat,‚Äù said the opal miner, and he ruffled my hair with his leathery hand. Then he went out into the hall, leaving me in the kitchen with the cat that was not my kitten.  
  
¬† The man put his head back through the door. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs called Monster,‚Äù he said.

¬† It felt like a bad joke.  
  
¬† I propped open the kitchen door, so the cat could get out. Then I went up to the bedroom, and lay on my bed, and cried for dead Fluffy. When my parents got home that evening, I do not think my kitten was even mentioned.  
  
¬† Monster lived with us for a week or more. I put cat food in the bowl for him in the morning and again at night as I had for my kitten. He would sit by the back door until I, or someone else, let him out. We saw him in the garden, slipping from bush to bush, or in trees, or in the undergrowth. We could trace his movements by the dead blue-tits and thrushes we would find in the garden, but we saw him rarely.  
  
¬† I missed Fluffy. I knew you could not simply replace something alive, but I dared not grumble to my parents about it. They would have been baffled at my upset: after all, if my kitten had been killed, it had also been replaced. The damage had been made up.  
  
¬† It all came back and even as it came back I knew it would not be for long: all the things I remembered, sitting on the green bench beside the little pond that Lettie Hempstock had once convinced me was an ocean.  
  
¬† II.  
  
¬† I was not happy as a child, although from time to time I was content. I lived in books more than I lived anywhere else.  
  
¬† Our house was large and many-roomed, which was good when they bought it and my father had money, not good later.  
  
¬† My parents called me into their bedroom one afternoon, very formally. I thought I must have done something wrong and was there for a telling-off, but no: they told me only that they were no longer affluent, that we would all need to make sacrifices, and that what I would be sacrificing was my bedroom, the little room at the top of the stairs. I was sad: my bedroom had a tiny little yellow washbasin they had put in for me, just my size; the room was above the kitchen, and immediately up the stairs from the television room, so at night I could hear the comforting buzz of adult conversation coming from below, through my half-open door, and I did not feel alone. Also, in my bedroom, nobody minded if I kept the hall door half-open, allowing in enough light that I was not scared of the dark, and, just as important, allowing me to read secretly, after my bedtime, using the dim hallway light to read by, if I needed to. I always needed to.  
  
¬† Exiled to my little sister‚Äôs huge bedroom, I was not heartbroken. There were already three beds in there, and I took the bed by the window. I loved that I could climb out of that bedroom window onto the long brick balcony, that I could sleep with my window open and feel the wind and the rain on my face. But we argued, my sister and I, argued about everything. She liked to sleep with the door to the hall closed, and the immediate arguments about whether the bedroom door should be open or shut were summarily resolved by my mother writing a chart that hung on the back of the door, showing that alternate nights were mine or my sister‚Äôs. Each night I was content or I was terrified, depending on whether the door was open or closed.  
  
¬† My former bedroom at the top of the stairs was let out, and a variety of people passed through it. I viewed them all with suspicion: they were sleeping in my bedroom, using my little yellow basin that was just the right size for me. There had been a fat Austrian lady who told us she could leave her head and walk around the ceiling; an architectural student from New Zealand; an American couple whom my mother, scandalized, made leave when she discovered they were not actually married; and, now, there was the opal miner.  
  
¬† He was a South African, although he had made his money mining for opals in Australia. He gave my sister and me an opal each, a rough black rock with green-blue-red fire in it. My sister liked him for this, and treasured her opal stone. I could not forgive him for the death of my kitten.  
  
¬† It was the first day of the spring holidays: three weeks of no school. I woke early, thrilled by the prospect of endless days to fill however I wished. I would read. I would explore.  
  
¬† I pulled on my shorts, my T-shirt, my sandals. I went downstairs to the kitchen. My father was cooking, while my mother slept in. He was wearing his dressing gown over his pajamas. He often cooked breakfast on Saturdays. I said, ‚ÄúDad! Where‚Äôs my comic?‚Äù He always bought me a copy of SMASH! before he drove home from work on Fridays, and I would read it on Saturday mornings.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn the back of the car. Do you want toast?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut not burnt.‚Äù  
  
¬† My father did not like toasters. He toasted bread under the grill, and, usually, he burnt it.  
  
¬† I went outside into the drive. I looked around. I went back into the house, pushed the kitchen door, went in. I liked the kitchen door. It swung both ways, in and out, so servants sixty years ago would be able to walk in or out with their arms laden with dishes empty or full.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad? Where‚Äôs the car?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn the drive.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† The telephone rang, and my father went out into the hall, where the phone was, to answer it. I heard him talking to someone.  
  
¬† The toast began to smoke under the grill.  
  
¬† I got up on a chair and turned the grill off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was the police,‚Äù my father said. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs reported seeing our car abandoned at the bottom of the lane. I said I hadn‚Äôt even reported it stolen yet. Right. We can head down now, meet them there. Toast!‚Äù  
  
¬† He pulled the pan out from beneath the grill. The toast was smoking and blackened on one side.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs my comic there? Or did they steal it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. The police didn‚Äôt mention your comic.‚Äù  
  
¬† My father put peanut butter on the burnt side of each piece of toast, replaced his dressing gown with a coat worn over his pajamas, put on a pair of shoes, and we walked down the lane together. He munched his toast as we walked. I held my toast, and did not eat it.  
  
¬† We had walked for perhaps five minutes down the narrow lane which ran through fields on each side, when a police car came up behind us. It slowed, and the driver greeted my father by name.  
  
¬† I hid my piece of burnt toast behind my back while my father talked to the policeman. I wished my family would buy normal sliced white bread, the kind that went into toasters, like every other family I knew. My father had found a local baker‚Äôs shop where they made thick loaves of heavy brown bread, and he insisted on buying them. He said they tasted better, which was, to my mind, nonsense. Proper bread was white, and pre-sliced, and tasted like almost nothing: that was the point.  
  
¬† The driver of the police car got out, opened the passenger door, told me to get in. My father rode up front beside the driver.  
  
¬† The police car went slowly down the lane. The whole lane was unpaved back then, just wide enough for one car at a time, a puddly, precipitous, bumpy way, with flints sticking up from it, the whole thing rutted by farm equipment and rain and time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThese kids,‚Äù said the policeman. ‚ÄúThey think it‚Äôs funny. Steal a car, drive it around, abandon it. They‚Äôll be locals.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad it was found so fast,‚Äù said my father.  
  
¬† Past Caraway Farm, where a small girl with hair so blonde it was almost white, and red, red cheeks, stared at us as we went past. I held my piece of burnt toast on my lap.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFunny them leaving it down here, though,‚Äù said the policeman, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs a long walk back to anywhere from here.‚Äù  
  
¬† We passed a bend in the lane and saw the white Mini over on the side, in front of a gate leading into a field, tires sunk deep in the brown mud. We drove past it, parked on the grass verge. The policeman let me out, and the three of us walked over  
to the Mini, while the policeman told my dad about crime in this area, and why it was obviously the local kids had done it, then my dad was opening the passenger side door with his spare key.  
  
¬† He said, ‚ÄúSomeone left something on the back seat.‚Äù My father reached back and pulled the blue blanket away, that covered the thing in the back seat, even as the policeman was telling him that he shouldn‚Äôt do that, and I was staring at the back seat because that was where my comic was, so I saw it.  
  
¬† It was an it, the thing I was looking at, not a him.  
  
¬† Although I was an imaginative child, prone to nightmares, I had persuaded my parents to take me to Madame Tussauds waxworks in London, when I was six, because I had wanted to visit the Chamber of Horrors, expecting the movie-monster Chambers of Horrors I‚Äôd read about in my comics. I had wanted to thrill to waxworks of Dracula and Frankenstein‚Äôs Monster and the Wolf-man. Instead I was walked through a seemingly endless sequence of dioramas of unremarkable, glum-looking men and women who had murdered people‚Äîusually lodgers, and members of their own families‚Äîand who were then murdered in their turn: by hanging, by the electric chair, in gas chambers. Most of them were depicted with their victims in awkward, social situations‚Äîseated around a dinner table, perhaps, as their poisoned family members expired. The plaques that explained who they were also told me that the majority of them had murdered their families and sold the bodies to anatomy. It was then that the word anatomy garnered its own edge of horror for me. I did not know what anatomy was. I knew only that anatomy made people kill their children.  
  
¬† The only thing that had kept me from running screaming from the Chamber of Horrors as I was led around it was that none of the waxworks had looked fully convincing. They could not truly look dead, because they did not ever look alive.  
  
¬† The thing in the back seat that had been covered by the blue blanket (I knew that blanket. It was the one that had been in my old bedroom, on the shelf, for when it got cold) was not convincing either. It looked a little like the opal miner, but it was dressed in a black suit, with a white, ruffled shirt and a black bow-tie. Its hair was slicked back and artificially shiny. Its eyes were staring. Its lips were bluish, but its skin was very red. It looked like a parody of health. There was no gold chain around its neck.  
  
¬† I could see, underneath it, crumpled and bent, my copy of SMASH! with Batman, looking just as he did on the television, on the cover.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt remember who said what then, just that they made me stand away from the Mini. I crossed the road, and I stood there on my own while the policeman talked to my father and wrote things down in a notebook.  
  
¬† I stared at the Mini. A length of green garden hose ran from the exhaust pipe up to the driver‚Äôs window. There was thick brown mud all over the exhaust, holding the hosepipe in place.  
  
¬† Nobody was watching me. I took a bite of my toast. It was burnt and cold.  
  
¬† At home, my father ate all the most burnt pieces of toast. ‚ÄúYum!‚Äù he‚Äôd say, and ‚ÄúCharcoal! Good for you!‚Äù and ‚ÄúBurnt toast! My favorite!‚Äù and he‚Äôd eat it all up. When I was much older he confessed to me that he had not ever liked burnt toast, had only eaten it to prevent it from going to waste, and, for a fraction of a moment, my entire childhood felt like a lie: it was as if one of the pillars of belief that my world had been built upon had crumbled into dry sand.  
  
¬† The policeman spoke into a radio in the front of his car.  
  
¬† Then he crossed the road and came over to me. ‚ÄúSorry about this, sonny,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a few more cars coming down this road in a minute. We should find you somewhere to wait that you won‚Äôt be in the way. Would you like to sit in the back of my car again?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head. I didn‚Äôt want to sit there again.  
  
¬† Somebody, a girl, said, ‚ÄúHe can come back with me to the farmhouse. It‚Äôs no trouble.‚Äù  
  
¬† She was much older than me, at least eleven. Her red-brown hair was worn relatively short, for a girl, and her nose was snub. She was freckled. She wore a red skirt‚Äîgirls didn‚Äôt wear jeans much back then, not in those parts. She had a soft Sussex accent and sharp gray-blue eyes.  
  
¬† The girl went, with the policeman, over to my father, and she got permission to take me away, and then I was walking down the lane with her.  
  
¬† I said, ‚ÄúThere is a dead man in our car.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why he came down here,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúThe end of the road. Nobody‚Äôs going to find him and stop him around here, three o‚Äôclock in the morning. And the mud there is wet and easy to mold.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you think he killed himself?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes. Do you like milk? Gran‚Äôs milking Bessie now.‚Äù  
  
¬† I said, ‚ÄúYou mean, real milk from a cow?‚Äù and then felt foolish, but she nodded, reassuringly.  
  
¬† I thought about this. I‚Äôd never had milk that didn‚Äôt come from a bottle. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd like that.‚Äù  
  
¬† We stopped at a small barn where an old woman, much older than my parents, with long gray hair, like cobwebs, and a thin face, was standing beside a cow. Long black tubes were attached to each of the cow‚Äôs teats. ‚ÄúWe used to milk them by hand,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúBut this is easier.‚Äù  
  
¬† She showed me how the milk went from the cow down the black tubes and into the machine, through a cooler and into huge metal churns. The churns were left on a heavy wooden platform outside the barn, where they would be collected each day by a lorry.  
  
¬† The old lady gave me a cup of creamy milk from Bessie the cow, the fresh milk before it had gone through the cooler. Nothing I had drunk had ever tasted like that before: rich and warm and perfectly happy in my mouth. I remembered that milk after I had forgotten everything else.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more of them up the lane,‚Äù said the old woman, suddenly. ‚ÄúAll sorts coming down with lights flashing and all. Such a palaver. You should get the boy into the kitchen. He‚Äôs hungry, and a cup of milk won‚Äôt do a growing boy.‚Äù  
  
¬† The girl said, ‚ÄúHave you eaten?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust a piece of toast. It was burned.‚Äù  
  
¬† She said, ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Lettie. Lettie Hempstock. This is Hempstock Farm. Come on.‚Äù She took me in through the front door, and into their enormous kitchen, sat me down at a huge wooden table, so stained and patterned that it looked as if faces were staring up at me from the old wood.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe have breakfast here early,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMilking starts at first light. But there‚Äôs porridge in the saucepan, and jam to put in it.‚Äù  
  
¬† She gave me a china bowl filled with warm porridge from the stovetop, with a lump of homemade blackberry jam, my favorite, in the middle of the porridge, then she poured cream on it. I swished it around with my spoon before I ate it, swirling it into a purple mess, and was as happy as I have ever been about anything. It tasted perfect.  
  
¬† A stocky woman came in. Her red-brown hair was streaked with gray, and cut short. She had apple cheeks, a dark green skirt that went to her knees, and Wellington boots. She said, ‚ÄúThis must be the boy from the top of the lane. Such a business going on with that car. There‚Äôll be five of them needing tea soon.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lettie filled a huge copper kettle from the tap. She lit a gas hob with a match and put the kettle onto the flame. Then she took down five chipped mugs from a cupboard, and hesitated, looking at the woman. The woman said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. Six. The doctor will be here too.‚Äù  
  
¬† Then the woman pursed her lips and made a tchutch! noise. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve missed the note,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe wrote it so carefully too, folded it and put it in his breast pocket, and they haven‚Äôt looked there yet.‚Äù  
  
¬†  
‚ÄúWhat does it say?‚Äù asked Lettie.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRead it yourself,‚Äù said the woman. I thought she was Lettie‚Äôs mother. She seemed like she was somebody‚Äôs mother. Then she said, ‚ÄúIt says that he took all the money that his friends had given him to smuggle out of South Africa and bank for them in England, along with all the money he‚Äôd made over the years mining for opals, and he went to the casino in Brighton, to gamble, but he only meant to gamble with his own money. And then he only meant to dip into the money his friends had given him until he had made back the money he had lost.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd then he didn‚Äôt have anything,‚Äù said the woman, ‚Äúand all was dark.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what he wrote, though,‚Äù said Lettie, squinting her eyes. ‚ÄúWhat he wrote was,  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTo all my friends,  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAm so sorry it was not like I meant to and hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for I cannot forgive myself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSame thing,‚Äù said the older woman. She turned to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lettie‚Äôs ma,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have met my mother already, in the milking shed. I‚Äôm Mrs. Hempstock, but she was Mrs. Hempstock before me, so she‚Äôs Old Mrs. Hempstock. This is Hempstock Farm. It‚Äôs the oldest farm hereabouts. It‚Äôs in the Domesday Book.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wondered why they were all called Hempstock, those women, but I did not ask, any more than I dared to ask how they knew about the suicide note or what the opal miner had thought as he died. They were perfectly matter-of-fact about it.  
  
¬† Lettie said, ‚ÄúI nudged him to look in the breast pocket. He‚Äôll think he thought of it himself.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a good girl,‚Äù said Mrs. Hempstock. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be in here when the kettle boils to ask if I‚Äôve seen anything unusual and to have their tea. Why don‚Äôt you take the boy down to the pond?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a pond,‚Äù said Lettie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my ocean.‚Äù She turned to me and said, ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù She led me out of the house the way we had come.

All of the little things are just adding up today to make it difficult to function. I'm in a flare up and so many things are making it worse mentally and physically. I didn't sleep nearly enough last night and my cat woke me up and hour early (poor sleep is a big contributor to my pain); I didn't get a job I was really hoping for and needed; it's hot here and I'm intolerant to heat so I feel like death; I think someone stole my noise cancelling headphones which are not easy to replace ($500) and I require them to function some days (I have ASD); my best friend got a full time job and we don't talk as much anymore and I feel guilty about that I think (emotion are confusing); and I'm realising lately that I have a serious anxiety problem and it really disables me in ways I didn't realise/attributed to ASD.


I just need to vent, but also wanted a bit of consolation and maybe some recommendations for general muscle and joint pain (F20's, if that matters for your ideas!). I've taken muscle relaxants with acetaminophen and have an ice pack on my back for the aches there. I'm also drinking a decaf iced coffee to help give some mental comfort and cool me down.

A little about me: For starters, I'm someone who grew up in a fairly strict household. Therefore, I don't have the free will when it comes to gala-ing (going out). Anyway, I'm an avid book reader. I often enjoy reading romantic tropes and psychological thrillers. I have a passion for writing‚ÄîI like to jot down little ideas and excerpts I've thought of, and at times, I also like to make poetry. Personality-wise, I'm quite the introvert. I struggle with social anxiety, and just interacting in general kinda drains me out fast. However, I promise I'm a cheerful and caring person, especially if I'm in a comfortable environment. A fun fact about me is that I LOVE coffee. I can drink it anywhere, anytime, iced, hot, with additives, or even just straight up black. (I take my caffeine seriously, y'all.) I'm a night owl - I think that's self-explanatory. I also LOVE music. Music has played such a huge part in my life, growing up surrounded by it.  
Now, putting those aside, I'm a dancer. I value dancing‚Äîit is the loml and forever will be, but the sad part is that I don't really know anyone who has the same level of interest in dance, so it would be really cool to meet someone who's also a dancer and loves dancing like me. Aside from dance, I'm also into fashion. I spend a lot of my time experimenting with clothes and styles. I do my research on pieces and jewelry; dressing up is my hobby at this point. (Btw, if y'all have any recs on where I can buy cheap and good quality statement pieces and accessories, that would be a great help. Thank you very much.)  
Despite being an introvert, I very much enjoy being outside. Shopping, cafe hopping, playing badminton in courts, karaoke, etc.  

If you feel like we'd vibe, don't hesitate to chat me:))

1lmwezq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lmwezq/reflection_on_a_sacred_moment/,Reflection on a sacred moment,"Dear M,

I thought about you this week because of a random conversation that I had with a friend. It‚Äôs been such a long time. I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I want you to know that for so many years, I thought about you often. It‚Äôs funny how we were in school together for six years and hardly knew each other, but then, for such a brief little moment, we saw each other, probably in ways that few people ever had. I added it up, and I think we spent about thirty-six hours together. Thirty-six hours over pieces of four days and two nights over the course of nearly a month in two countries. Thirty-six hours in some sort of cocoon or bubble where the rest of the world was so distant from us. Where we were insulated from everyone we knew and everything we might have thought or assumed about each other for years. 

Seeing you out of context like that, thousands of miles away from the world we grew up in, I guess we saw each other without filters. All of a sudden, you weren‚Äôt that popular girl or the smartest girl in our algebra class. You weren‚Äôt C‚Äôs little sister or J‚Äôs ex-girlfriend; you were just you. And I‚Äôm glad I finally saw you. 

It‚Äôs easy to think that I only saw you differently because we slept together. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the sex rocked my world, but if I‚Äôm being honest, that wasn‚Äôt what moved me. It only took about an hour for me to feel drawn to you in a way that was unnerving. When I saw you, I almost didn‚Äôt even say anything because I wasn‚Äôt sure it was really you. Because what were the odds, really? But I called out your name and watched as you started looking through the crowd for a familiar face. And then I saw the recognition and confusion I‚Äôd felt a moment before scroll through your eyes. And then I saw your smile and felt that same smile on my face. And then a hug. Not a shoulder tap or a friendly side hug, but a full-bodied embrace. Then a quick subway ride and a walk to your neighborhood cafe and then a cup of coffee that took a lot longer to drink than it should have. A real conversation after years of ‚Äúhey‚Äù and ‚Äúdid you finish the homework.‚Äù I guess part of it was that, even though we were really still kids in so many ways, I was seeing you as an adult. Independent. We were our own people, figuring out who we really were, not characters that had to fit within a certain set of stereotypes. This wasn‚Äôt a tv show. It was just life. One cup of coffee, and it‚Äôs like the mist was gone, and I saw you. And honestly, I really got a kick out of sharing a cigarette with you for the first time. That was the true ‚Äúthe guys back home would never believe this‚Äù moment. Even walking to your flat, the only thing on my mind was that it was nice to have you as a friend. But then, as unexpectedly as anything I‚Äôve ever experienced, you became my lover. And I didn‚Äôt consider what the people back home would think or believe about it. Because those people just didn‚Äôt exist in this new world we created for ourselves. 

Being with you was like falling forward into a memory. Everything was so familiar and yet so new at the same time. I‚Äôd thought about you sexually before. All the guys I knew had. But the person I‚Äôd pictured in my imagination was so different from the person I held in my arms. You were both comfortable and nerve-wracking. You brought both clarity and confusion. It was the epoch of belief; it was the epoch of incredulity. But you were there, and you were real, and I experienced a lifetime of you in a single moment. 

There is no way to describe how good it felt being with you. The warmth and softness of your touch. The wetness of your kiss on my lips and on my body. The feast you provided for all my senses. The beauty in your eyes and the raw eroticism of your body as it moved against mine. The charged connection when we were coupled together, our bodies melding into one another, intertwining, engulfing, absorbing each other. You were otherworldly. 

I feel like our little affair, in some ways, may have been the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve ever had. We went through so many emotions in such a short period of time. We saw and heard each other. We acknowledged and supported each other. We took each other to the heights of ecstasy and held each other in quiet moments. My admiration and respect for you grew exponentially, as did my affection. And then we said goodbye without hurting each other. There‚Äôs something almost sacred about that, and it‚Äôs stayed with me all these years later. 

I don‚Äôt know what kind of impact or time together had on you overall, but I know it has some. I saw your mother a few years later, and she mentioned that you kept that picture of us at the train station on your dresser until they sold the house a couple of years later. She also said you were married with two kids, living in Pennsylvania. I hope to everything holy that means that you‚Äôve found the life and love and happiness you deserve. And I hope that the time we spent together was what you needed in that moment and that I made you feel the happiness and love that you needed then and that you were able to carry it with you. 

Love is a funny word to use I guess, but it‚Äôs definitely possible to love somebody without it being ‚Äúlike that.‚Äù And I did grow to love you in those few hours. Not a silly schoolboy crush that was mistaken for love, but an appreciation of who you are and gratefulness that you shared part of your life with me. I think that counts as love, because I don‚Äôt know what else to call it. 

I‚Äôm also grateful that you saw me for who I was. I still don‚Äôt know what you thought of me before. You said you knew I was smart but quiet. You didn‚Äôt say it, but I know I also had a reputation for being a little rough around the edges just because I was from the wrong side of the tracks. Maybe you‚Äôd already seen through that, maybe not. But you were the first person from among our peers that I know of who discovered that I was sentimental and actually had a romantic streak. That‚Äôs something that others have expressed surprise over in later years, but you were the first to pull me out of my shell in that regard. It was easy to want to show you that though. Not just because I wanted to impress you. But because you actively appreciated and validated it. When you came to Rome, it was tempting to just try to take you straight to a hotel and get you back in bed. But there was no way I could reduce you to a sexual conquest. I guess because I was already conquered by you. 

I do wish I could tell you all this without it being awkward. It‚Äôs a shame that we lost touch the way we did, but also, in some way, it‚Äôs probably for the best because it let us leave our time together undisturbed. As you discovered my sentimental nature, it may come as no surprise to you that I still have your necklace that you gave to me, along with what‚Äôs left of the pressed carnation and a lot of lines in my journal about you. I dug them out this week after thinking about you. Part of me wanted to make sure it was real and not something I‚Äôd imagined, I guess. Part of me just wanted to feel the warmth of your touch again, and, strangely, I did. I only feel good emotions when I think about you. Only sweetness, no sadness. That‚Äôs not something I can say about very many women. Maybe it‚Äôs the most unconventional loves that stand the test of time. 

At any rate, wherever you are now, I hope you are having an amazing life. I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm just a distant memory, and that‚Äôs the way it should be. But I hope that every now and then you remember me and feel the warmth of my arms around you in that moment. I, for one, am content to know that I once made the world a more beautiful place because I made you smile. 

Affectionately yours,
S

It started with my bed yelling at me.

‚ÄúGet off me, fatso,‚Äù it growled, the mattress creaking with every syllable.

It‚Äôs an enchanted thing I won in a poker game against the God of Sleep‚Äîa self-satisfied raccoon in a smoking jacket. The bed had a personality, a very specific allergy to crumbs, and an attitude that would make a barmaid slap it. I rolled off with the grace of a beached walrus, narrowly avoiding a dagger that had fallen into the folds of my robe sometime last night. Possibly mine. Possibly not.

My name‚Äôs Grimes. I‚Äôm a mage. An investigator. And a cautionary tale about arcane metabolism and late-night pastries.

I‚Äôm also the only person in Cinderfall dumb enough to keep working cases after being blacklisted by the Guild, cursed by three different godlings, and disinvited from the Annual Sorcerers‚Äô Ball for ""excessive flatulence during invocation.""

My office is in South Cradle‚Äîone of the rougher districts, where the buildings lean like drunks and the rats pay rent. The sign outside says Grimes‚ÄîArcane Investigations. Fair Rates. No Resurrections. The ""No"" is underlined three times.

So when a troll bouncer named Grulk came through my door at eight in the morning, fists the size of meat wagons, I wasn‚Äôt surprised.

‚ÄúYou owe for the pitcher of bloodmead,‚Äù he bellowed.

I sighed, rubbing my temples. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt drink a pitcher. I sampled a flight. One tiny glass.‚Äù

‚ÄúFlight was twelve glasses. Each was size of a pint.‚Äù

That was fair. ‚ÄúLet me get my coin purse,‚Äù I muttered.

Grulk lunged.

I dodged like a man who‚Äôs had a lot of practice dodging. Not well, but fast.

The resulting crash took out my desk, my chair, and a family of dust imps living behind the tax scrolls. Grulk stumbled, blinking in confusion as the floorboards groaned under his weight.

Before he could charge again, the door opened and a voice said, ‚ÄúIs this standard client service, or should I come back later?‚Äù

She stood in the doorway like she owned the sun. Long black coat, high collar, silver rings, and a magical aura that screamed expensive. She looked around the wreckage, raised one eyebrow, and said:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Grimes?‚Äù

‚ÄúDepends,‚Äù I said, standing up with the help of a chair leg. ‚ÄúAre you paying in coin or blood?‚Äù

She tossed a coin pouch onto the remains of my desk. It hit with the weight of real gold and minor back pain.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Vexa,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAcolyte of the Divine Bureaucracy. A god‚Äôs gone missing. We want him found.‚Äù

Grulk frowned. ‚ÄúGod?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne of the minor ones. Qel-Thun, the Deity of Lost Things.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Grulk, visibly disappointed. ‚ÄúHe lose himself again?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, rubbing my chin. ‚ÄúThis time, I think someone helped.‚Äù

Cinderfall is what happens when you let gods build a city, and then let goblins manage the zoning permits.

It‚Äôs all spires and crumbling arches, alleyways that change direction depending on the moon, and pigeons that scream in Latin. Gods live here like everyone else. Some have temples. Some have laundromats. The Goddess of Cleanliness runs a surprisingly violent bathhouse in Northbridge. The God of Slight Regret runs a pawn shop that smells like old tears and cinnamon.

We started in the Temple of Qel-Thun, tucked behind a wine merchant and a noodle vendor who only served noodles to ghosts. The temple looked less like a sacred space and more like a flea market run by hoarders. Shelves of mismatched gloves, drawers labeled ‚ÄúSpare Teeth,‚Äù a single sock floating in midair and humming Beethoven.

The high priest, Sister Mildred, was a goblin with horn rimmed spectacles and a smoker‚Äôs cough that could summon rain.

‚ÄúQel was depressed,‚Äù she said, pouring tea into cracked porcelain mugs shaped like screaming faces. ‚ÄúKept mumbling about being ‚Äòa divine afterthought.‚Äô Wanted a strike. The other minor gods laughed him out of the Divine Union meetings. Said he didn‚Äôt even have a holy symbol. Just a question mark on a stick.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny enemies?‚Äù Vexa asked, sipping and immediately spitting out the tea.

‚ÄúAll gods have enemies,‚Äù Mildred said. ‚ÄúMortals, other gods, their own priests. But if you want someone who really hated him... maybe check the God of Found Things. Bitter little halfling. Runs a market stall in the East Bazaar.‚Äù

I made a note. ‚ÄúAnd the last time you saw Qel?‚Äù

‚ÄúThree days ago. Said he had a plan. Said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll show them what it means when nothing stays found.‚Äô Then he walked into his reliquary and vanished.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlan,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs never a good word when a god uses it.‚Äù

The East Bazaar was having a divine dispute when we arrived. Two gods, Svelta, Goddess of Coin Flips, and Darnak, God of Overreaction were shouting about a misinterpreted prophecy and hurling fish at each other.

Darnak was seven feet tall, wore golden plate armor, and had a hammer named Consequence. His voice echoed like a cathedral collapsing.

‚ÄúMy cutlery has vanished. I cannot eat without my celestial fork.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very tragic,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHave you tried chopsticks?‚Äù

Darnak turned. ‚ÄúAre you mocking me, gnome?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a gnome. Just short. And cursed with metabolism.‚Äù

Vexa cleared her throat. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre investigating the disappearance of Qel-Thun.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù bellowed Darnak. ‚ÄúThat imbecile‚Äôs absence has unleashed chaos. Nothing stays put. I lost my war maps, my scepter, my favorite fluffy slippers.‚Äù

Something tickled my brain.

‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs going missing,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúNot just small stuff. Maps. Weapons. Gods' belongings. That‚Äôs not random.‚Äù

Vexa‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúYou think someone‚Äôs using his power?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think someone‚Äôs weaponized the concept of ‚Äòlost.‚Äô‚Äù

Which is when my belt disappeared.

We traced the magic to a forgotten building under the Goblin Postal Archives. According to city records, it had been condemned four times, declared sacred twice, and turned into a petting zoo for one week in 312 AE.

At the bottom, past the halls of misplaced letters and undelivered tax threats, we found a glowing rune carved into a chest of drawers. It pulsed with divine energy.

‚ÄúI told you it wasn‚Äôt kidnapping,‚Äù said the voice behind us.

Splitch emerged from a pile of undelivered birthday cards. He was a goblin with thick spectacles, a wand that spat glitter, and the twitchy energy of a caffeinated ferret.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Self-Proclaimed God of Misdirection,‚Äù he said proudly. ‚ÄúNobody appreciates me! So I borrowed Qel‚Äôs spark. Just for a little while. See how it felt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou stole a god‚Äôs divinity and stuck it in a sock drawer,‚Äù Vexa said flatly.

‚ÄúWell technically it‚Äôs a drawer-themed dimensional pocket. Very ergonomic.‚Äù

Qel-Thun was inside, blinking, sipping tea, and mumbling about labor rights.

We let him out.

The magic unraveled. Things started to reappear across the city: lost children, love letters, one particularly angry ferret. The divine tide began to ebb.

Back at my office, I found my desk mysteriously repaired. Probably a thank you from Qel. Gods don‚Äôt say ‚Äúthanks‚Äù the normal way. They just fix things or make your enemies smell like cheese.

Vexa handed me a slip of parchment. It was a requisition form for an official pardon from the Divine Bureaucracy, signed by five minor gods and stamped with Qel‚Äôs seal: a question mark in a cup of coffee.

I looked up. ‚ÄúYou got me cleared?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get used to it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut you did good, Grimes. Even if your pants are still on backwards.‚Äù

‚ÄúFashion statement,‚Äù I said.

As she left, I found a note under my mug.

Thank you. You‚Äôre very hard to misplace. ‚ÄîQ

I smiled, leaned back in my chair.

And promptly fell out of it.

The gods still don‚Äôt tip.

You ever feel like a place is daring you to fail? Like a maze that keeps moving just to see if you‚Äôre still paying attention?

That‚Äôs what it feels like working nights here.

I don‚Äôt clock in anymore. I don‚Äôt even check the register balance. I check the rules. I check the red-labeled bucket under the sink. I check the offerings I left for Lila.

I check for war.

Tonight I brought her something simple: a small glass jar of chocolate-covered orange peels, sealed with wax. I left it where she usually picks things up‚Äînext to the impulse candy near Register One. She was already watching from behind the beverage coolers when I set it down.

She didn‚Äôt come forward, not yet.

At 1:33 AM, the Slurpee machine let out a low mechanical grunt.
My stomach clenched.

At 1:34, it started to cycle.
Dark red. Thick. No ice crystals. It came out slow.

I slapped an ‚ÄúOUT OF ORDER‚Äù sign on the machine and ran for the red-labeled bucket. Got it underneath just in time. The moment the first drop hit the plastic, the store went silent.

No coolers. No fans. Even the buzzing overhead lights cut out for three full seconds.

Then the humming started again.

I cycled one full bucket. Then another. Then a third, just to be safe.

The color finally shifted back to normal‚Äîicy blue from the cherry nozzle. I cleaned everything like the rule says. Burned the rags outside. Said nothing.

No one drank it this time.

At 4:03 AM, the CDC guy came back.

‚ÄúFresh drop,‚Äù he said, swinging the back room door open like it belonged to him. ‚ÄúMilk, sandwiches, and a special crate. For the girl.‚Äù

The crate was old wood again‚Äîolder than last night. The marks on the side weren‚Äôt burned this time. They were carved. Fresh. Still splintered at the edges.

‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt want anything from you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not accepting deliveries on her behalf.‚Äù

He blinked slowly. That smirk of his curled up too far.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt speak for her.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe already did,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not welcome here.‚Äù

He stepped forward. The air around him felt heavier. Like standing too close to a transformer in the rain.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to regret choosing sides.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou regret thinking I haven‚Äôt already,‚Äù I said.

I hit the black phone closet again‚Äîjust cracked the door this time.
A static wind poured out. Cold enough to sting my face.

The CDC guy hissed through his teeth and backed off.
He left the crate behind.

I waited until he pulled out of the lot before dragging it out behind the dumpster.
I left it upside down in the dark.
When I went back twenty minutes later, it was gone.

The offering to Lila was gone too.
In its place was a handwritten note in blue crayon on a Totem-brand receipt:

‚ÄúYou made a choice. So did he.‚Äù
‚ÄîL


---

When the sun came up, I stayed late. I had to.

My manager came in with his usual clipboard and coffee combo. I cornered him near the soda fountain.

‚ÄúHe came again,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCDC guy. Tried to deliver something for Lila. The Slurpee machine started again too. Red. I handled it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

He cut me off. Didn‚Äôt even look at me.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to,‚Äù I said, louder. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just rule-following anymore. This place is reacting. Testing. It‚Äôs trying to twist the rules to get me to screw up.‚Äù

‚ÄúMason,‚Äù he said slowly, ‚Äúyou were hired to work from 10 PM to 6 AM. I do payroll. I sign off on your schedule. But as far as I‚Äôm concerned‚Ä¶‚Äù
He looked up for the first time. Eyes tired. Mouth dry.
‚ÄúThere is no third shift.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seriously going to pretend this doesn‚Äôt exist?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot pretend.‚Äù He swallowed hard. ‚ÄúI choose not to know. That‚Äôs the only way I sleep at night.‚Äù

He handed me another envelope. He didn‚Äôt explain what was inside.

‚ÄúIf you need more to stay, just ask,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt quit. Please.‚Äù

Then he walked away.

Like if he moved fast enough, the truth wouldn‚Äôt catch up to him.

‚ÄîMason

So apparently the managers pretending that my shift doesn't exist, I suppose if I think hard enough, I can't really fault him. If I wasn't making more on a paycheck than he was, I don't think I would stay. And the fact that he offered me even more. That tells me that when the company I work for acquired this property they knew this was going on. And because of my little side trip, and I ran into a very similar convenience store to mine one night on the way home. I wonder if corporations are buying up properties like this to try to cover them up. Or at least appease them for something. I suppose I'll see you next time, if I survive the next night that is, 
Until then, this is Mason

My partner, who just left me, is the one who did the research into PMDD and I was able to get connected with a psychiatrist who agreed that this was my problem. 

With medication, I‚Äôm able to feel what I consider a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù amount of PMS symptoms‚Äîbloating, cramping, a little anxiety or sadness, but totally manageable. 

What I cannot handle is missing a single dose or even an accidental smaller dose, and having a huge disruption in my expected routine. 

I feel like military type structure around PMDD days is really important and helpful for me. 

I know I know I know I can‚Äôt miss a single dose of meds, that is clear to me. But I also struggle with ADHD. I‚Äôm not meaning to miss a dose. I don‚Äôt actively want to avoid taking my meds. I had a crisis the other day and all I could say through my sobbing to the people who came to help was, ‚ÄúI want to go home. I want to take my meds.‚Äù Over and over again. 

I want real coping skills on top of my meds. I want organization. Structure. I want a better life. I don‚Äôt want to be this way anymore. It‚Äôs breaking my heart and leaving me hopeless. 

I know there will be times no matter what where my routine isn‚Äôt going to be exactly what I want, or there will be some event that I view as detrimental and life ruining. The most recent case was me waking up and seeing one of my dogs had destroyed my garden when my regular routine consists of waking up doing a bit of housework and getting some coffee and then viewing my garden and touching my plant babies. 

I took my meds the night before but only after seeing my garden was destroyed found a pill in the bed. I had only taken two instead of three. It was too late. It didn‚Äôt matter. I flew into a panicked state. 

I need coping skills. I just cried and sobbed over my destroyed plants. I tried to rescue them. I threw the gardening tools. I wanted the whole garden gone. My heart was broken. My routine disrupted. My sanctuary destroyed. I had no healthy proper coping skills. 

Whether I can get advice on coping skills, vitamins or supplements, med management with ADHD brain speed, or even more extreme options like IUDs, partial or full hysterectomy, literally anything. 

Please. I desperately want my life back. PMDD is a monster and I don‚Äôt know what to do where to go from here. I feel lost. Like I don‚Äôt even know myself because half my life is literally like Jekyll and Hyde. Even when I KNOW the cyclical nature of this evil thing, it wins. I see it coming from a mile away and I‚Äôm still not prepared enough. 

I just want my life back. ",1,1751141884.0,PMDD,1,1.0,False

¬† THERE WAS DRIED CHICKEN blood imbedded under my fingernails. When you raise the dead for a living, you have to spill a little blood. It clung in flaking patches to my face and hands. I'd tried to clean the worst of it off before coming to this meeting, but some things only a shower would fix. I sipped coffee from a personalized mug that said, ""Piss me off, pay the consequences,"" and stared at the two men sitting across from me.  
  
¬† Mr. Jeremy Ruebens was short, dark, and grumpy. I'd never seen him when he wasn't either frowning or shouting. His small features were clustered in the middle of his face as if some giant hand had mashed them together before the clay had dried. His hands smoothed over the lapel of his coat, the dark blue tie, tie clip, white shirt collar. His hands folded in his lap for a second, then began their dance again: coat, tie, tie clip, collar, lap. I figured I could stand to watch him fidget maybe five more times before I screamed for mercy and promised him anything he wanted.  
  
¬† The second man was Karl Inger. I'd never met him before. He was a few inches over six feet. Standing, he had towered over Ruebens and me. A wavy mass of short-cut red hair graced a large face. He had honest-to-god muttonchop sideburns that grew into one of the fullest mustaches I'd ever seen. Everything was neatly trimmed except for his unruly hair. Maybe he was having a bad hair day.  
  
¬† Ruebens's hands were making their endless dance for the fourth time. Four was my limit.  
  
¬† I wanted to go around the desk, grab his hands, and yell, ""Stop that!"" But I figured that was a little rude, even for me. ""I don't remember you being this twitchy, Ruebens,"" I said.  
  
¬† He glanced at me. ""Twitchy?""  
  
¬† I motioned at his hands, making their endless circuit. He frowned and placed his hands on top of his thighs. They remained there, motionless. Self-control at its best.  
  
¬† ""I am not twitchy, Miss Blake.""  
  
¬† ""It's Ms. Blake. And why are you so nervous, Mr. Ruebens?"" I sipped my coffee.  
  
¬† ""I am not accustomed to asking for help from people like you.""  
  
¬† ""People like me?"" I made it a question.  
  
¬† He cleared his throat sharply. ""You know what I mean.""  
  
¬† ""No, Mr. Ruebens, I don't.""  
  
¬† ""Well, a zombie queen . . ."" He stopped in mid-sentence. I was getting pissed, and it must have shown on my face. ""No offense,"" he said softly.  
  
¬† ""If you came here to call me names, get the hell out of my office. If you have real business, state it, then get the hell out of my office.""  
  
¬† Ruebens stood up. ""I told you she wouldn't help us.""  
  
¬† ""Help you do what? You haven't told me a damn thing,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Perhaps we should just tell her why we have come,"" Inger said. His voice was a deep, rumbling bass, pleasant.  
  
¬† Ruebens drew a deep breath and let it out through his nose. ""Very well."" He sat back down in his chair. ""The last time we met, I was a member of Humans Against Vampires.""  
  
¬† I nodded encouragingly and sipped my coffee.  
  
¬† ""I have since started a new group, Humans First. We have the same goals as HAV, but our methods are more direct.""  
  
¬† I stared at him. HAV's main goal was to make vampires illegal again, so they could be hunted down like animals. It worked for me. I used to be a vampire slayer, hunter, whatever. Now I was a vampire executioner. I had to have a death warrant to kill a specific vampire, or it was murder. To get a warrant, you had to prove the vampire was a danger to society, which meant you had to wait for the vampire to kill people. The lowest kill was five humans, the highest was twenty-three. That was a lot of dead bodies. In the good ol' days you could just kill a vampire on sight.  
  
¬† ""What exactly does 'more direct methods' mean?""  
  
¬† ""You know what it means,"" Ruebens said.  
  
¬† ""No,"" I said, ""I don't."" I thought I did, but he was going to have to say it out loud.  
  
¬† ""HAV has failed to discredit vampires through the media or the political machine. Humans First will settle for destroying them all.""  
  
¬† I smiled over my coffee mug. ""You mean kill every last vampire in the United States?""  
  
¬† ""That is the goal,"" he said.  
  
¬† ""It's murder.""  
  
¬† ""You have slain vampires. Do you really believe it is murder?""  
  
¬† It was my turn to take a deep breath. A few months ago I would have said no. But now, I just didn't know. ""I'm not sure anymore, Mr. Ruebens.""  
  
¬† ""If the new legislation goes through, Ms. Blake, vampires will be able to vote. Doesn't that frighten you?""  
  
¬† ""Yes,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Then help us.""  
  
¬† ""Quit dancing around, Ruebens; just tell me what you want.""  
  
¬† ""Very well, then. We want the daytime resting place of the Master Vampire of the City.""  
  
¬† I just looked at him for a few seconds. ""Are you serious?""  
  
¬† ""I am in deadl  
y earnest, Ms. Blake.""  
  
¬† I had to smile. ""What makes you think I know the Master's daytime retreat?""  
  
¬† It was Inger who answered. ""Ms. Blake, come now. If we can admit to advocating murder, then you can admit to knowing the Master."" He smiled ever so gently.  
  
¬† ""Tell me where you got the information and maybe I'll confirm it, or maybe I won't.""  
  
¬† His smile widened just a bit. ""Now who's dancing?""  
  
¬† He had a point. ""If I say I know the Master, what then?""  
  
¬† ""Give us his daytime resting place,"" Ruebens said. He was leaning forward, an eager, nearly lustful look on his face. I wasn't flattered. It wasn't me getting his rocks off. It was the thought of staking the Master.  
  
¬† ""How do you know the Master is a he?""  
  
¬† ""There was an article in the Post-Dispatch. It was careful to mention no name, but the creature was clearly male,"" Ruebens said.  
  
¬† I wondered how Jean-Claude would like being referred to as a ""creature."" Better not to find out. ""I give you an address and you go in and what, stake him through the heart?""  
  
¬† Ruebens nodded. Inger smiled.  
  
¬† I shook my head. ""I don't think so.""  
  
¬† ""You refuse to help us?"" Ruebens asked.  
  
¬† ""No, I simply don't know the daytime resting place."" I was relieved to be able to tell the truth.  
  
¬† ""You are lying to protect him,"" Ruebens said. His face was growing darker; deep frown wrinkles showed on his forehead.  
  
¬† ""I really don't know, Mr. Ruebens, Mr. Inger. If you want a zombie raised, we can talk; otherwise . . ."" I let the sentence trail off and gave them my best professional smile. They didn't seem impressed.  
  
¬† ""We consented to meeting you at this ungodly hour, and we are paying a handsome fee for the consultation. I would think the least you could do is be polite.""  
  
¬† I wanted to say, ""You started it,"" but that would sound childish. ""I offered you coffee. You turned it down.""  
  
¬† Ruebens's scowl deepened, little anger lines showing around his eyes. ""Do you treat all your . . . customers this way?""  
  
¬† ""The last time we met, you called me a zombie-loving bitch. I don't owe you anything.""  
  
¬† ""You took our money.""  
  
¬† ""My boss did that.""  
  
¬† ""We met you here at dawn, Ms. Blake. Surely you can meet us halfway.""  
  
¬† I hadn't wanted to meet with Ruebens at all, but after Bert took their money, I was sort of stuck with it. I'd set the meeting at dawn, after my night's work, but before I went to bed. This way I could drive home and get eight hours' uninterrupted sleep. Let Ruebens's sleep be interrupted.  
  
¬† ""Could you find out the location of the Master's retreat?"" Inger asked.  
  
¬† ""Probably, but if I did, I wouldn't give it to you.""  
  
¬† ""Why not?"" he asked.  
  
¬† ""Because she is in league with him,"" Ruebens said.  
  
¬† ""Hush, Jeremy.""  
  
¬† Ruebens opened his mouth to protest, but Inger said, ""Please, Jeremy, for the cause.""  
  
¬† Ruebens struggled visibly to swallow his anger, but he choked it down. Control.  
  
¬† ""Why not, Ms. Blake?"" Inger's eyes were very serious, the pleasant sparkle seeping away like melting ice.  
  
¬† ""I've killed master vampires before, none of them with a stake.""  
  
¬† ""How then?""  
  
¬† I smiled. ""No, Mr. Inger, if you want lessons in vampire slaying, you're going to have to go elsewhere. Just by answering your questions, I could be charged as an accessory to murder.""  
  
¬† ""Would you tell us if we had a better plan?"" Inger said.  
  
¬† I thought about that for a minute. Jean-Claude dead, really dead. It would certainly make my life easier, but . . . but.  
  
¬† ""I don't know,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Why not?""  
  
¬† ""Because I think he'll kill you. I don't give humans over to the monsters, Mr. Inger, not even people who hate me.""  
  
¬† ""We don't hate you, Ms. Blake.""  
  
¬† I motioned with the coffee mug towards Ruebens. ""Maybe you don't, but he does.""  
  
¬† Ruebens just glared at me. At least he didn't try to deny it.  
  
¬† ""If we come up with a better plan, can we talk to you again?"" Inger asked.  
  
¬† I stared at Ruebens's angry little eyes. ""Sure, why not?""  
  
¬† Inger stood and offered me his hand. ""Thank you, Ms. Blake. You have been most helpful.""  
  
¬† His hand enveloped mine. He was a large man, but he didn't try using his size to make me feel small. I appreciated that.  
  
¬† ""The next time we meet, Anita Blake, you will be more cooperative,"" Ruebens said.  
  
¬† ""That sounded like a threat, Jeremy.""  
  
¬† Ruebens smiled, a most unpleasant smile. ""Humans First believes the means justify the end, Anita.""  
  
¬† I opened my royal purple suit jacket. Inside was a shoulder holster complete with a Browning Hi-Power 9mm. The purple skirt's thin black belt was just sturdy enough to be looped through the shoulder holster. Executive terrorist chic.  
  
¬† ""When it comes to survival, Jeremy, I believe that, too.""  
  
¬† ""We have not offered you violence,"" Inger said.  
  
¬† ""No, but ol' Jeremy here is thinking about it. I just want him and the rest of your little group to believe I'm serious. Mess with me, and people are going to die.""  
  
¬† ""There are dozens of us,"" Ruebens said, ""and only one of you.""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, but who's going to be first in line?"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Enough of this, Jeremy, Ms. Blake. We didn't come here to threaten you. We came for your help. We will come up with a better plan and talk to you again.""  
  
¬† ""Don't bring him,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Of course,"" Inger said. ""Come along, Jeremy."" He opened the door. The soft clack of computer keys came from the outer office. ""Good-bye Ms. Blake.""  
  
¬† ""Good-bye, Mr. Inger, it's been really unpleasant.""  
  
¬† Ruebens stopped in the doorway and hissed at me, ""You are an abomination before God.""  
  
¬† ""Jesus loves you, too,"" I said, smiling. He slammed the door behind them. Childish.  
  
¬† I sat on the edge of my desk and waited to make sure they had left before going outside. I didn't think they'd try anything in the parking lot, but I really didn't want to start shooting people. Oh, I would if I had to, but it was better to avoid it. I had hoped flashing the gun would make Ruebens back off. It had just seemed to enrage him. I rotated my neck, trying to ease some of the tension away. It didn't work.  
  
¬† I could go home, shower, and get eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. Glorious. My beeper went off. I jumped like I'd been stung. Nervous, me?  
  
¬† I hit the button, and the number that flashed made me groan. It was the police. To be exact, it was the Regional Preternatural Investigation Team. The Spook Squad. They were responsible for all preternatural crime in Missouri. I was their civilian expert on monsters. Bert liked the retainer I got, but better yet, the good publicity.  
  
¬† The beeper went off again. Same number. ""Shit."" I said it softly. ""I heard you the first time, Dolph."" I thought about pretending that I'd already gone home, turned off the beeper, and was now unavailable, but I didn't. If Detective Sergeant Rudolf Storr called me at half-past dawn, he needed my expertise. Damn.  
  
¬† I called the number and through a series of relays finally got Dolph's voice. He sounded tinny and faraway. His wife had gotten him a car phone for his birthday. He must have been near the limit of its range. It still beat the heck out of talking to him on the police radio. That always sounded like an alien language.  
  
¬† ""Hi, Dolph, what's up?""  
  
¬† ""Murder.""  
  
¬† ""What sort of murder?""  
  
¬† ""The kind that needs your expertise,"" he said.  
  
¬† ""It's too damn early in the morning to play twenty questions. Just tell me what's happened.""  
  
¬† ""You got up on the wrong side of bed this morning, didn't you?""  
  
¬† ""I haven't been to bed yet.""  
  
¬† ""I sympathize, but get your butt out here. It looks like we have a vampire victim on our hands.""  
  
¬† I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""Shit.""  
  
¬† ""You could say that.""  
  
¬† ""Give me the address,"" I said.  
  
¬† He did. It was over the river and through the woods, way to hell and gone in Arnold. My office was j  
ust off Olive Boulevard. I had a forty-five-minute drive ahead of me, one way. Yippee.  
  
¬† ""I'll be there as soon as I can.""  
  
¬† ""We'll be waiting,"" Dolph said, then hung up.  
  
¬† I didn't bother to say good-bye to the dial tone. A vampire victim. I'd never seen a lone kill. They were like potato chips; once the vamp tasted them, he couldn't stop at just one. The trick was, how many people would die before we caught this one?  
  
¬† I didn't want to think about it. I didn't want to drive to Arnold. I didn't want to stare at dead bodies before breakfast. I wanted to go home. But somehow I didn't think Dolph would understand. Police have very little sense of humor when they're working on a murder case. Come to think of it, so do I.  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† THE MAN'S BODY LAY on its back, pale and naked in the weak morning sunlight. Even limp with death his body was good, a lot of weights, maybe jogging. His longish yellow hair mixed with the still-green lawn. The smooth skin of his neck was punctured twice with neat fang marks. The right arm was pierced at the bend of the elbow, where a doctor draws blood. The skin of the left wrist was shredded, like an animal had gnawed it. White bone gleamed in the fragile light.  
  
¬† I had measured the bite marks with my trusty tape measure. They were different sizes. At least three different vamps, but I would have bet everything I owned that it was five different vampires. A master and his pack, or flock, or whatever the hell you call a group of vampires.  
  
¬† The grass was wet from early morning mist. The moisture soaked through the knees of the coveralls I had put on to protect my suit. Black Nikes and surgical gloves completed my crime-scene kit. I used to wear white Nikes, but they showed blood too easily.  
  
¬† I said a silent apology for what I had to do, then spread the corpse's legs apart. The legs moved easily, no rigor. I was betting that he hadn't been dead eight hours, not enough time for rigor mortis to set in. Semen had dried on his shriveled privates. One last joy before dying. The vamps hadn't cleaned him off. On the inside of his thigh, close to the groin, were more fang marks. They weren't as savage as the wrist wound, but they weren't neat either.  
  
¬† There was no blood on the skin around the wounds, not even the wrist wound. Had they cleaned the blood off? Wherever he was killed, there was a lot of blood. They'd never be able to clean it all up. If we could find where he died, we'd have all sorts of clues. But in the neatly clipped lawn in the middle of a very ordinary neighborhood, there were no clues. I was betting on that. They'd dumped the body in a place as sterile and unhelpful as the dark side of the moon.  
  
¬† Mist floated over the small residential neighborhood like waiting ghosts. The mist was so low to the ground that it was like walking through sheets of drizzling rain. Tiny beads of moisture clung to the body where the mist had condensed. Beads collected in my hair like silver pearls.

¬† I stood in the front yard of a small, lime-green house with white trim. A chain-link fence peeked around one side encircling a roomy backyard. It was October, and the grass was still green. The top of a sugar maple loomed over the house. Its leaves were that brilliant orangey-yellow that is peculiar to sugar maples, as if their leaves were carved from flame. The mist helped the illusion, and the colors seemed to bleed on the wet air.  
  
¬† All down the street were other small houses with autumn-bright trees and bright green lawns. It was still early enough that most people hadn't gone to work yet, or school, or wherever. There was quite a crowd being held back by the uniformed officers. They had hammered stakes into the ground to hold the yellow Do-Not-Cross tape. The crowd pressed as close to the tape as they dared. A boy of about twelve had managed to push his way to the front. He stared at the dead man with huge brown eyes, his mouth open in a little ""wow"" of excitement. God, where were his parents? Probably gawking at the corpse, too.  
  
¬† The corpse was paper-white. Blood always pools to the lowest point of the body. In this case dark, purplish bruising should have set in at buttocks, arms, legs, the entire back of his body. There were no marks. He hadn't had enough blood in him to cause lividity marks. Whoever had murdered him had drained him completely. Good to the last drop? I fought the urge to smile and lost. If you spend a lot of time staring at corpses, you get a peculiar sense of humor. You have to, or you will go stark raving mad.  
  
¬† ""What's so funny?"" a voice asked.  
  
¬† I jumped and whirled. ""God, Zerbrowski, don't sneak up on me like that.""  
  
¬† ""Is the heap big vampire slayer jumping at shadows?"" He grinned at me. His unruly black hair stuck up in three separate tufts like he'd forgotten to comb it. His tie was at half-mast over a pale blue shirt that looked suspiciously like a pajama top. The brown suit jacket and pants clashed with the top.  
  
¬† ""Nice pajamas.""  
  
¬† He shrugged. ""I've got a pair with little choo-choos on them. Katie thinks they're sexy.""  
  
¬† ""Your wife got a thing for trains?"" I asked.  
  
¬† His grin widened. ""If I'm wearing 'em.""  
  
¬† I shook my head. ""I knew you were perverted, Zerbrowski, but little kids' jammies, that's truly sick.""  
  
¬† ""Thank you."" He glanced down at the body, still smiling. The smile faded. ""What do you think of this?"" He nodded towards the dead man.  
  
¬† ""Where's Dolph?""  
  
¬† ""In the house with the lady who found the body."" He plunged his hands into the pockets of his pants and rocked on his heels. ""She's taking it pretty hard. Probably the first corpse she's seen outside of a funeral.""  
  
¬† ""That's the way most normal folks see dead people, Zerbrowski.""  
  
¬† He rocked forward hard on the balls of his feet, coming to a standstill. ""Wouldn't it be nice to be normal?""  
  
¬† ""Sometimes,"" I said.  
  
¬† He grinned. ""Yeah, I know what you mean."" He got a notebook out of his jacket pocket that looked as if someone had crumbled it in their fist.  
  
¬† ""Geez, Zerbrowski.""  
  
¬† ""Hey, it's still paper."" He tried smoothing the notebook flat, but finally gave up. He posed, pen over the wrinkled paper. ""Enlighten me, oh preternatural expert.""  
  
¬† ""Am I going to have to repeat this to Dolph? I'd like to just do this once and go home to bed.""  
  
¬† ""Hey, me too. Why do you think I'm wearing my jammies?""  
  
¬† ""I just thought it was a daring fashion statement.""  
  
¬† He looked at me. ""Mm-huh.""  
  
¬† Dolph walked out of the house. The door looked too small to hold him. He's six-eight and built bulky like a wrestler. His black hair was buzzed close to his head, leaving his ears stranded on either side of his face. But Dolph didn't care much for fashion. His tie was tight against the collar of his white dress shirt. He had to have been pulled out of bed just like Zerbrowski, but he looked neat and tidy and businesslike. It never mattered what hour you called Dolph, he was always ready to do his job. A professional cop down to his socks.  
  
¬† So why was Dolph heading up the most unpopular special task force in St. Louis? Punishment for something, that much I was sure of, but I'd never asked what. I probably never would. It was his business. If he wanted me to know, he'd tell me.  
  
¬† The squad had originally been a pacifier for the liberals. See, we're doing something about supernatural crime. But Dolph had taken his job and his men seriously. They had solved more supernatural crime in the last two years than any other group of policemen in the country. He had been invited to give talks to other police forces. They had even been loaned out to neighboring states twice.  
  
¬† ""Well, Anita, let's have it.""  
  
¬† That's Dolph; no preliminaries. ""Gee, Dolph, it's nice to see you too.""  
  
¬† He just looked at me.  
  
¬† ""Okay, okay."" I knelt on the far side of the body so I could point as I talked. Nothing like a visual aid to get your point across. ""Just measuring shows that at least three different vampires fed on the man.""  
  
¬† ""But?"" Dolph said.  
  
¬† He's quick. ""But I think that every wound is a different vampire.""  
  
¬† ""Vampires don't hunt in packs.""  
  
¬† ""Usually they are solitary hunters, but not always.""  
  
¬† ""What causes them to hunt in packs?"" he asked.  
  
¬† ""Only two reasons that I've ever come across: first, one is the new dead and an older vampire is teaching the ropes, but that's just two pairs of fangs, not five; second, a master vampire is controlling them, and he's gone rogue.""  
  
¬† ""Explain.""  
  
¬† ""A master vampire has nearly absolute control over his or her flock. Some masters use a group kill to solidify the pack, but they wouldn't dump the body here. They'd hide it where the police would never find it.""  
  
¬† ""But the body's here,"" Zerbrowski said, ""out in plain sight.""  
  
¬† ""Exactly; only a master that's gone crazy would dump a body like this. Most masters even before vampires were legally alive wouldn't flaunt a kill like this. It attracts attention, usually attention with a stake in one hand and a cross in the other. Even now, if we could trace the kill to the vampires that did it, we could get a warrant and kill them."" I shook my head. ""Slaughter like this is bad for business, and whatever else vampires are, they're practical. You don't stay alive and hidden for centuries unless you're discreet and ruthless.""  
  
¬† ""Why ruthless?"" Dolph said.  
  
¬† I stared up at him. ""It's utterly practical. Someone discovers your secret, you kill them, or make them one of your . . . children. Good business practices, Dolph, nothing more.""  
  
¬† ""Like the mob,"" Zerbrowski said.  
  
¬† ""Yeah.""  
  
¬† ""What if they panicked?"" Zerbrowski asked. ""It was almost dawn.""  
  
¬† ""When did the woman find the body?""  
  
¬† Dolph checked his notebook. ""Five-thirty.""  
  
¬† ""It's still hours until dawn. They didn't panic.""  
  
¬† ""If we've got a crazy master vampire, what exactly does that mean?""  
  
¬† ""It means they'll kill more people faster. They may need blood every night to support five vampires.""  
  
¬† ""A fresh body every night?"" Zerbrowski made it a question.  
  
¬† I just nodded.  
  
¬† ""Jesus,"" he said.  
  
¬† ""Yeah.""  
  
¬† Dolph was silent, staring down at the dead man. ""What can we do?""  
  
¬† ""I should be able to raise the corpse as a zombie.""  
  
¬† ""I thought you couldn't raise a vampire victim as a zombie,"" Dolph said.  
  
¬† ""If the corpse is going to rise as a vampire, you can't."" I shrugged. ""The whatever that makes a vampire interferes with a raising. I can't raise a body that is already set to rise as a vamp.""  
  
¬† ""But this one won't rise,"" Dolph said, ""so you can raise it.""  
  
¬† I nodded.  
  
¬† ""Why won't this vampire victim rise?""  
  
¬† ""He was killed by more than one vampire, in a mass feeding. For a corpse to rise as a vampire, you have to have just one vampire feeding over a space of several days. Three bites ending with death, and you get a vampire. If every vampire victim could come back, we'd be up to our butts in blood-suckers.""  
  
¬† ""But this victim can come back as a zombie?"" Dolph said.  
  
¬† I nodded.  
r /> ¬† ""When can you do the animating?""  
  
¬† ""Three nights from tonight, or really two. Tonight counts as one night.""  
  
¬† ""What time?""  
  
¬† ""I'll have to check my schedule at work. I'll call you with a time.""  
  
¬† ""Just raise the murder victim and ask who killed him. I like it,"" Zerbrowski said.  
  
¬† ""It's not that easy,"" I said. ""You know how confused witnesses to violent crimes are. Have three people see the same crime and you get three different heights, different hair colors.""  
  
¬† ""Yeah, yeah, witness testimony is a bitch,"" Zerbrowski said.  
  
¬† ""Go on, Anita,"" Dolph said. It was his way of saying, ""Zerbrowski, shut up."" Zerbrowski shut up.  
  
¬† ""A person who died as the victim of a violent crime is more confused. Scared shitless, so that sometimes they don't remember very clearly.""  
  
¬† ""But they were there,"" Zerbrowski said. He looked outraged.  
  
¬† ""Zerbrowski, let her finish.""  
  
¬† Zerbrowski pantomimed locking his lips with a key and throwing the key away. Dolph frowned. I coughed into my hand to hide the smile. Mustn't encourage Zerbrowski.  
  
¬† ""What I'm saying is that I can raise the victim from the dead, but we may not get as much information as you'd expect. The memories we do get will be confused, painful, but it might narrow the field down as to which master vampire led the group.""  
  
¬† ""Explain,"" Dolph said.  
  
¬† ""There are only supposed to be two master vampires in St. Louis right now. Malcolm, the undead Billy Graham, and the Master of the City. There's always the possibility we've got someone new in town, but the Master of the City should be able to police that.""  
  
¬† ""We'll take the head of the Church of Eternal Life,"" Dolph said.  
  
¬† ""I'll take the Master,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Take one of us with you for backup.""  
  
¬† I shook my head. ""Can't; if he knew I let the cops know who he was, he'd kill us both.""  
  
¬† ""How dangerous is it for you to do this?"" Dolph asked.  
  
¬† What was I supposed to say? Very? Or did I tell them the Master had the hots for me, so I'd probably be okay? Neither. ""I'll be alright.""  
  
¬† He stared at me, eyes very serious.  
  
¬† ""Besides, what choice do we have?"" I motioned at the corpse. ""We'll get one of these a night until we find the vampires responsible. One of us has to talk to the Master. He won't talk to police, but he will talk to me.""  
  
¬† Dolph took a deep breath and let it out. He nodded. He knew I was right. ""When can you do it?""  
  
¬† ""Tomorrow night, if I can talk Bert into giving my zombie appointments to someone else.""  
  
¬† ""You're that sure the Master will talk to you?""  
  
¬† ""Yeah."" The problem with Jean-Claude was not getting to see him, it was avoiding him. But Dolph didn't know that, and if he did, he might have insisted on going with me. And gotten us both killed.  
  
¬† ""Do it,"" he said. ""Let me know what you find out.""  
  
¬† ""Will do,"" I said. I stood up, facing him over the bloodless corpse.  
  
¬† ""Watch your back,"" he said.  
  
¬† ""Always.""  
  
¬† ""If the Master eats you, can I have your nifty coveralls?"" Zerbrowski asked.  
  
¬† ""Buy your own, you cheap bastard.""  
  
¬† ""I'd rather have the ones that have enveloped your luscious body.""  
  
¬† ""Give it a rest, Zerbrowski. I'm not into little choo-choos.""  
  
¬† ""What the hell do trains have to do with anything?"" Dolph asked.  
  
¬† Zerbrowski and I looked at each other. We started giggling and couldn't stop. I could claim sleep deprivation. I'd been on my feet for fourteen straight hours, raising the dead and talking to right-wing fruitcakes. The vampire victim was a perfect end to a perfect night. I had a right to be hysterical with laughter. I don't know what Zerbrowski's excuse was.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† THERE ARE A HANDFUL of days in October that are nearly perfect. The sky stretches overhead in a clear blue, so deep and perfect that it makes everything else prettier. The trees along the highway are crimson, gold, rust, burgundy, orange. Every color is neon-bright, pulsing in the heavy golden sunlight. The air is cool but not cold; by noon you can wear just a light jacket. It was weather for taking long walks in the woods with someone you wanted to hold hands with. Since I didn't have anyone like that, I was just hoping for a free weekend to go away by myself. The chances of that were slim to none.  
  
¬† October is a big month for raising the dead. Everyone thinks that Halloween is the perfect season for raising zombies. It isn't. Darkness is the only requirement. But everyone wants an appointment for midnight on Halloween. They think spending All Hallows Eve in a cemetery killing chickens and watching zombies crawl out of the ground is great entertainment. I could probably sell tickets.  
  
¬† I was averaging five zombies a night. It was one more zombie than anyone else was doing in one night. I should never have told Bert that four zombies didn't wipe me out. My own fault for being too damn truthful. Of course, truth was, five didn't wipe me out either, but I was damned if I'd tell Bert.  
  
¬† Speaking of my boss, I had to call him when I got home. He was going to love me asking for the night off. It made me smile just thinking about it. Any day I could yank Bert's chain was a good day.  
  
¬† I pulled into my apartment complex at nearly one in the afternoon. All I wanted was a quick shower and seven hours of sleep. I had given up on eight hours; it was too late in the day for that. I had to see Jean-Claude tonight. Joy. But he was the Master Vampire of the City. If there was another master vampire around, he'd know it. I think they can smell each other. Of course, if Jean-Claude had committed the murder, he wasn't likely to confess. But I didn't really believe he'd done it. He was much too good a business vampire to get messy. He was the only master vampire I'd ever met who wasn't crazy in some way: psychotic, or sociopathic, take your pick.  
  
¬† Alright, alright, Malcolm wasn't crazy, but I didn't approve of his methods. He headed up the fastest-growing church in America today. The Church of Eternal Life offered exactly that. No leap of faith, no uncertainty, just a guarantee. You could become a vampire and live forever, unless someone like me killed you, or you got caught in a fire, or hit by a bus. I wasn't sure about the bus part, but I'd always wondered. Surely there must be something massive enough to damage even a vampire beyond healing. I hoped someday to test the theory.  
  
¬† I climbed the stairs slowly. My body felt heavy. My eyes burned with the need to sleep. It was three days before Halloween, and the month couldn't end too soon for me. Business would start dropping off before Thanksgiving. The decline would continue until after New Year's, then it'd start picking up. I prayed for a freak snowstorm. Business drops off if the snow is bad. People seem to think we can't raise the dead in deep snow. We can, but don't tell anyone. I need the break.  
  
¬† The hallway was full of the quiet noises of my day-living neighbors. I was fishing my keys out of my coat pocket when the door opposite mine opened. Mrs. Pringle stepped out. She was tall, slender, thinning with age, white hair done in a small bun at the back of her head. The hair was perfectly white. Mrs. Pringle didn't bother with dyes or makeup. She was over sixty-five and didn't care who knew it.  
  
¬† Custard, her Pomeranian, pranced at the end of his leash. He was a round ball of golden fur with little fox ears. Most cats outweighed him, but he's one of those little dogs with a big-dog attitude. In a past life he was a Great Dane.  
  
¬† ""Hello, Anita."" Mrs. Pringle smiled as she said it. ""You're not just getting in from work, are you?"" Her pale eyes were disapproving.  
  
¬† I smiled. ""Yeah, I had an . . . emergency come up.""  
  
¬† She raised an eyebrow, probably wondering what an animator would have for an emergency, but she was too polite to ask. ""You don't take good enough care of yourself, Anita. If you keep burning the candle at both ends, you'll be worn out by the time you're my age.""  
  
¬† ""Probably,"" I said.  
  
¬† Custard yapped at me. I did not smile at him. I don't believe in encouraging small, pushy dogs. With that peculiar doggy sense, he knew I didn't like him, and he was determined to win me over.  
  
¬† ""I saw the painters were in your apartment last week  
. Is it all repaired?""  
  
¬† I nodded. ""Yeah, all the bullet holes have been patched up and painted over.""  
  
¬† ""I'm really sorry I wasn't home to offer you my apartment. Mr. Giovoni says you had to go to a hotel.""  
  
¬† ""Yeah.""  
  
¬† ""I don't understand why one of the other neighbors didn't offer you a couch for the night.""  
  
¬† I smiled. I understood. Two months ago I had slaughtered two killer zombies in my apartment and had a police shootout. The walls and one window had been damaged. Some of the bullets had gone through the walls into other apartments. No one else had been hurt, but none of the neighbors wanted anything to do with me now. I suspected strongly that when my two-year lease was up, I would be asked to leave. I guess I couldn't blame them.  
  
¬† ""I heard you were wounded.""  
  
¬† I nodded. ""Just barely."" I didn't bother telling her that the bullet wound hadn't been from the shootout. The mistress of a very bad man had shot me in the right arm. It was healed to a smooth, shiny scar, still a little pink.  
  
¬† ""How did your visit with your daughter go?"" I asked.  
  
¬† Mrs. Pringle's face went all shiny with a smile. ""Oh, wonderful. My last and newest grandchild is perfect. I'll show you pictures later, after you've had some sleep."" That disapproving look was back in her eyes. Her teacher face. The one that could make you squirm from ten paces, even if you were innocent. And I hadn't been innocent for years.  
  
¬† I held up my hands. ""I give up. I'll go to bed. I promise.""  
  
¬† ""You see you do,"" she said. ""Come along, Custard, we have to go out for our afternoon stroll."" The tiny dog danced at the end of his leash, straining forward like a miniature sled dog.  
  
¬† Mrs. Pringle let three pounds of fluffy fur drag her down the hall. I shook my head. Letting a fuzzball boss you around was not my idea of dog ownership. If I ever had another dog, I'd be boss, or one of us wouldn't survive. It was the principle of the thing.  
  
¬† I opened the door and stepped inside the hush of my apartment. The heater whirred, hot air hissing out of the vents. The aquarium clicked on. The sounds of emptiness. It was wonderful.  
  
¬† The new paint was the same off-white as the old. The carpet was grey; couch and matching chair, white. The kitchenette was pale wood with white and gold linoleum. The two-seater breakfast table in the kitchen was a little darker than the cabinets. A modern print was the only color on the white walls.

Amazing rooms with Daily, impeccable housekeeping service.  Kids loved the daily replenishment of skittles and M&M's.

Superbly friendly and accommodating staff with great service all around.

The only notable area for improvement is tbe service at dinner.  It seems their staff to table ratio is very low due to which dinner can at times take up to 2 hours to complete.  We found in-room dining to take an extra amount of time as well which made it a little inconvenient.  You're better off if strapped for time, to just go down and eat in a restaurant.

Be mindful of all service charges and ask what's what.  Not everything is a mandatory charge.

Would definitely recommend staying here and will definitely be back.

Izuku's real father is Liquid Snake himself. (In this universe, the events of Metal Gear Solid 1 take place at the same time as BNHA, only Liquid survived by pure luck.)  
  
Liquid decided to live a more peaceful life. He created a fake name and works in many different jobs. Being a jack-of-all-trades, do you need an economic guide? Call him, do you need a viped tank capable of launching nuclear warheads? Call him.  
  
Liquid, surprisingly, is a very good father. He's always been there for his son. He does, however, hate Izuku's uncles and grandfather (Big Boss, Solidus, and Solidus).  
  
Shoto thinks Izuku is All Might's secret son, but he sees Liquid Snake in the stands at the sports festival with Big Boss, Solidus Snake, and Liquid Snake. Oh, and Venom Snake, not an uncle, but Izuku's uncle (he is and isn't, you know what I mean).  
  
Like that time, All Might met Liquid.
