1p0jfjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p0jfjz/chest_pain/,Chest pain,"Hi,

For the past 3 years I've (31F) been having on and off slight pain in the area of my left breast, I noticed it happens for around 3-4 days every month, sometimes in the middle of my menstrual cycle, sometimes right before my period comes. It also feels like something inside is swollen, though on the outside nothing has changed.

Additional details: I don't take any medication, the only supplement I take is vitamin D3 daily. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I drink coffee almost daily (1 cup only) and always with milk. I eat a mostly plant-based diet, with occasional fish (salmon and tuna). I do eat sweets, but not that much. I don't have any food allergies or intolerances. Sometimes I feel more stressed, but not to the point I get extremely anxious. Also don't have panic attacks. I sleep well, around 7-9 hours depending on the day. I go to bed around 2 AM (I work in the afternoon).

I've already been to a cardiologist, endocrinologist, checked the chest area by X-ray and results came out fine. 

Please help, is this serious?

1p0jfcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1p0jfcp/distilled_vs_zero_water/,Distilled vs Zero Water?!,"Telling a lot of you what you already know here, but water makes a huge difference.

I've always used Third Wave Water packets (light roast) with distilled water. More recently I'd replaced the distilled water with a Zero Water filter/jug - essentially completely demineralising (London) tap water and then remineralising with TWW. I figured this would be a much more sustainable and cost effective method than buying huge quantities of distilled water from Amazon.

A lot of the coffees I've been drinking over the last few months have been sometimes underwhelming, with an underlying astringency, more prevalent in some coffees over others, but more often than not still present.

It was recently I decided to have a play around with distilled water again + TWW... and the two coffees I'm drinking now (an Anaerobic Natural and a washed) have been the best I've drank in a long time... consistently with every cup.

Having run out of distilled+TWW water, I reverted today to the Zero filtered+TWW water and low and behold, the astringecy was back, with both cups (all variables being the same) having less depth and just generally tasting not as good.

Can anyone with more know-how than me opine as to why on earth this is? Whilst I'm sure placebo may be a suggested factor, it just seems highly unlikely, given all other variables have been the same and the familiar astringency that was there with the Zero water has returned...

Could there be other things present in tap water, outside of mineral composition that make it through the filter, that distilled water just wouldn't have?",1,1763489806.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

“I thought you knew,” he continued. «That Giuseppe had invited everyone. He told me that he had written to the group, that anyone who wanted could come. Then… in the end no one came.”

I felt my stomach flip. No groups, no messages. For her it was a fact: everyone warned, no one showed up. In his mind, I had chosen not to go.

“Understood,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

She looked down at the bottle. «I also felt bad for you. I thought maybe you were offended because I told you that I wouldn't work, that I would be on a boat. I didn't mean to seem... superficial to you.""

I burst out laughing. Not a happy laugh: one of the bitter ones that scratch your throat.

For a myriad of reasons, I will not be staying on with the firm that I am presently articling with, which means that I now have to begin thinking about how I will go about applying elsewhere.

I’m ready and able to contact folks in my professional network (e.g. coffee chats, LinkedIn connections, cold calls/emails, formal applications, etc), but I’m not sure what’s best when it comes to timing. When should I start really “going at it” so to speak? 

I can put together some application materials as early as this weekend, but it still seems so far out from when firms will make decisions about hireback.

1p0jbuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1p0jbuh/aita_for_thinking_the_punishment_doesnt_fit_the/,AITA for thinking the punishment doesn't fit the crime when my BIL filmed me cheating and now I'm losing everything?,"I'm 29. My husband is 34. We've been married for four years and I thought everything was fine. Better than fine, actually. He travels constantly for work, sometimes two weeks out of the month, and I got lonely. That's not an excuse. I'm just telling you how it started.

I met my trainer at the gym eight months ago. He's 26, built like he's carved from stone, and he paid attention to me in a way my husband stopped doing years ago. My husband would come home from business trips exhausted, fall asleep on the couch, barely touch me. Meanwhile this guy remembered everything I said, texted me good morning, made me feel seen.

It started as just training sessions. Then coffee after. Then he'd come to our house when my husband was traveling. I told myself I deserved this. My husband got his career, his freedom, his business trips to Miami and Los Angeles. I got loneliness and a king-sized bed I slept in alone most nights.

Here's where I messed up. I let my husband keep paying for the training sessions. $200 a session, three times a week. He never questioned it because I told him I was getting in shape for us, for our future. He smiled and said he was proud of me. Meanwhile I was sleeping with the man he was literally funding.

My trainer knew I was married. He didn't care. Actually, he liked it. He'd make comments about how my husband was stupid for leaving me alone so much, how he'd never let me out of his sight if I was his. It felt good hearing that.

Three weeks ago, my husband's brother showed up at our house unannounced. My husband was supposed to be in Seattle for a conference. His brother said he was in town and wanted to drop off some tools he'd borrowed. I was in the shower. I didn't hear him knock. He used the spare key my husband gave him for emergencies.

He walked in on me and my trainer on the living room couch.

I screamed. My trainer grabbed his clothes and ran. My brother-in-law just stood there with his phone out. He'd been filming. I don't know for how long.

""You're disgusting,"" he said. His voice was so calm it scared me more than if he'd yelled. ""My brother worships you. He works himself to death to give you this life. And this is what you do.""

I tried to explain, tried to say it wasn't what it looked like, but the evidence was literally dripping down my thighs. He left without another word.

I called my husband immediately. Crying, panicking, trying to get ahead of it. He didn't answer. I called fifteen times. Nothing.

He came home two days later. Didn't yell. Didn't cry. Just handed me an envelope. Divorce papers. His lawyer had already filed. And there were printouts. Screenshots from his brother's phone. Time-stamped videos. Photos of my trainer's car in our driveway on dates that matched my husband's business trips, going back months.

His brother had suspected something for weeks. He'd been watching. Documenting. Building a case.

""You used my money to pay your boyfriend,"" my husband said. His voice was flat, empty. ""Eight months of training sessions. $19,200. I have all the receipts. My lawyer says that's financial infidelity on top of everything else.""

I tried to apologize. Tried to say I'd stop, that we could fix this. He laughed. Actually laughed.

""My brother has videos of you in our house, on our furniture, with a man I was paying to be near you. My lawyer has everything. You're not getting the house. You're not getting alimony. And I'm filing a civil suit against your trainer for alienation of affection. We'll see how much he likes you when he's paying my legal fees.""

That was three weeks ago. I've been staying with my mom. My whole family knows why. My sister won't speak to me. My dad called me a disgrace. My mom keeps asking how I could do this to such a good man.

My trainer blocked me on everything the day after my husband filed the lawsuit against him. Guess he wasn't so interested once there were actual consequences.

The house is being sold. My husband kept all our wedding photos, all the nice furniture, everything we built together. I get to keep my clothes and my car. That's it. His lawyer made sure I won't see a penny of his retirement account or savings. They're using the training session payments as proof I was stealing from him to fund my affair.

My brother-in-law posts photos on social media of him and my husband having dinner, going to baseball games, normal brother stuff. But I know what he did. I know he set this up perfectly, waited for the right moment, made sure there was undeniable evidence.

My friends are split. Half say I deserve everything I got. The other half say his brother had no right to film me without permission, that what he did was a violation. That maybe I made a mistake but the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

I don't know anymore. I ruined my marriage, I know that. But his brother turned a private betrayal into a legal nightmare with video evidence that's now in court documents. My lawyer says the footage might not even be admissible but the damage is done.

Was I wrong to cheat? Obviously. But did I deserve to have my most intimate moments filmed and used as ammunition in a divorce designed to leave me with nothing? My mom says I made my bed. My therapist says I'm a victim of surveillance. I just feel like my whole life fell apart because I was lonely and made terrible choices.

Should I have seen this coming? AITAH for thinking his brother went too far even though I was the one who cheated first?

1p0jblp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1p0jblp/10_months_ago_i_was_fat_hated_life_now_im_slim/,10 months ago I was fat & hated life. Now I’m slim & excited for the future.,"I’ve (29F, 5’4) lost 44 lbs so far this year, going from 165 lbs to 121 lbs. I’m still dieting and determined to tone up & reach my dream body. 

I had lost weight 4 years ago, going from 175 lbs to 125 lbs. But I slowly gained it all back due to depression. I really deeply resented myself for re-gaining all that weight. I started to only wear baggy T-shirts and oversized jeans. 

Since reaching 125 lbs, I’ve started getting such better treatment in life. Men are so much nicer to me, and compliment me regularly. Women are also friendlier, and seem less dismissive of me. At my workplace there are a lot of athletes, and it used to destroy me. Seeing such fit and active people, while I’m in such a fat body made my self esteem plummet.

Now, when I see beautiful people I don’t immediately spiral or binge eat. I can actually wear cute outfits and feel attractive, instead of a pig with lipstick on. I feel such a deep sense of peace, compared to the constant internal screaming when I was fat. I still honestly have a lot of body goals, I want to push myself to become the best version of me. 

Losing weight has felt like coming back home to myself, being me again. I can wear cute outfits, I can feel pretty, I can even feel relaxed now. Because all that time I spent hating myself and my body is now time spent taking care of myself. For me personally, being fat absolutely destroyed my mental health. I couldn’t even function because I was so ashamed of the state of myself. Now, it’s like having a clean slate to rebuild my life again. 

I’ve even gotten into a relationship, when before I was single and socially isolated for 5 years. Around 130 lbs, I struggled a lot with confidence and intimacy. But since losing another 10 lbs, I’m started to feel better about myself. I can’t lie, I started losing weight rapidly when I developed a crush on my boyfriend. It was such a wake-up call, I realized I’m not even myself at that high weight. 

The best tips that worked for me: 

Calorie count, get more steps in, go to therapy, track weight weekly, portion control is king, eat satiating foods, popcorn not chips, eat a lot of soup, load up on fruits and vegetables, no soda, no sweet coffees, limit fried foods, eat less carbs and more protein. 

I track my calories daily on the app LoseIt! which is 100% non-negotiable now. Over the summer I didn’t track calories, and I didn’t lose any weight for over 2 months. I’ve truly listened to the saying “80% diet, 20% movement” for weight loss, and I’m really happy with my results. Of course I wish I’d have lifted weights, as I’d have my dream body by now. But going from fat to slim, feels pretty good regardless.

**Why This Pick?**

The Stars have been on an absolute tear. And while the Islanders have quietly won 4 of their last 5 outings, I just can’t bet against Dallas on a heater. Having won their last 5 straight and having managed to put 12 goals in the bag over just their last 2 games, both the Stars offense & defense have been firing on all cylinders (I’m still in awe of that Montreal Canadiens shutout!) After watching NY take a fall to Colorado, I expect the Stars to grab a comfortable victory in regulation here.

After a few months they published an interview and said the book was launched first in closed circuit. I found the link to the interview on TikTok.  I am not allowed to put it here, so I copied it.

Episode 1: “The Illness, the Silence, the Return”

Published by Biavicon Publishing



BP:

Chris, first of all — let me just say how deeply glad I am that you made it through what I know was a sensitive period.

Do you want us to talk about it, or do we just pretend it never happened?



Chris Bianco (smiling faintly):

No need to pretend. It started as what seemed to be just a stubborn cold — one of those things you expect to pass in a few days. But it turned out to be… much more than that.

Unfortunately, the weeks of hospitalization and everything that followed meant all my other plans — including Visconti — had to be put on hold.

When I was suddenly pulled out of circulation, I had just finished Volume II. I was already deep into outlining Volume III. Volume I was about to go into production.

Everything froze. And stayed frozen for a while.



BP: 

So you opted for a soft launch, in some closed circles…



Chris:

Exactly. We decided to release Volume I (“Never Say No To Mafia” e.n.) within closed circles first — quietly — just to give me time to recover, and to make sure the gap between volumes wouldn’t stretch too far once the momentum resumed.



BP:

Is there anything else you’d like to share about what happened?



Chris (after a pause):

No. I think that’s enough. The rest of the story… can stay private.

But yes — if there’s one thing I’ll say:

Don’t ignore what seems like just a persistent cold. Sometimes it’s more.



BP:

Fair. Now let’s talk Visconti.



Chris (with a breath of relief):

Let’s talk Visconti.



BP:

We’ve seen absolutely passionate reactions from the early readers — people are obsessed. How does that make you feel?



Chris (quiet, thoughtful):

Honestly? I’m still processing it.

BP:

So, why don’t you tell our readers how Visconti first appeared?

Chris (laughs):

Why don’t you tell them? You are the main reason why Visconti exists.

BP:

Alright, let’s tell them together.

It was a Psychiatry Conference in 2022. Late at night. A little too much to drink. A little too little time left to do anything else.

We were sitting in the hotel’s restaurant, talking about books and hobbies and all the things people don’t seem to like anymore.

And someone said: “I love mafia stories, but there’s nothing worth reading.”

I remember I leaned in and said, “I agree. But who writes mafia well anymore?”

And that’s when you, Chris, interrupted:

“Mafia? I’ll tell you who. I would!”



Chris (grinning):

Everyone laughed.



BP:

Everyone laughed — and I dared you. I said: “Okay, then tell me. How would you write mafia?”

And you started talking. For about two hours. You told a story. The conversation at the table stopped. Everyone listened.

And the fascination… it just kept growing.



Chris:

And then you looked at me and said:

“You should write this down.”



BP:

And you smiled and said: “Maybe in another life.”



Chris (quietly):

Yes. That’s exactly how it happened.

And from that night on, it never left me. The idea wouldn’t let me go. So I gave it a try. And I started writing. But I never imagined it would go this far.

But here we are.



BP:

So, Chris — I assume this story had been living in your head for quite some time.

Because the way you told it that night… it didn’t feel improvised. You weren’t inventing — you were remembering.

And I’ve talked to some of the early readers, the ones from the closed circles where Volume I already circulates.

And they’re all saying the same thing:

“This is a testimony.”

“This is remembrance.”

“This is definitely not fiction.”

How would you comment?



Chris (laughs):

How could I comment? You’ve read the book.

The only thing I can say is — it’s fiction. Would you really write something like that, and then say:

“Oh yes, by the way, they’re real people. And they might not only read the book — they might hear about the interviews too.”

BP: (laughing):

Chris, that is definitely not a denial.



Chris (smiling):

But it’s also definitely not a confirmation.



BP:

Okay. We’ll leave it at that. For now.

Tell me something about your main character then.

If you had to characterize Alessandro Visconti in three phrases, what would you say?



Chris (after a pause):

You want three sentences.

For a man who took me three volumes.

That’s cruel. But fine. Let me try.



He’s the kind of man you obey before you understand why.
He lives like someone who’s already paid the price.
And he makes you forget — that he could end you in one breath.


BP:

Jesus.



Chris:

That’s him.

BP:

Chris, let’s play a game.

If one of the main characters in Visconti would accept to sit down and have a coffee with us…

Who would it be?



Chris (smiles):

That would be Giuliano. Definitely Giuliano.



BP:

Why? Is Giuliano the more open one?



Chris:

No. Not really. He’s just the one who can better control the outcome.

You see, Giuliano doesn’t need to hide behind silence. He uses it, of course — like all of them — but he doesn’t depend on it. He could sit here, smile, talk, charm the audience, and somehow… never really tell you anything.



BP:

But you wouldn’t mind Alessandro?



Chris:

Mind? Of course not. I’d love to see him walk through the door. But he wouldn’t. Not for a coffee. Not like this.



BP:

Too risky?



Chris:

Too intimate. Alessandro doesn’t come for a coffee and a story. You’re either summoned… or you don’t get to meet him at all.

BP:

You promised to do this on a weekly basis. So, I am already thrilled to speak to you next week.

Just one more question today: When will “Never Say No To Mafia” available for everyone?

Chris:

It will come on Amazon, probably on Kindle Unlimited. Soon, I hope. But in the last events light, I am not making promises anymore.



BP: 

Chris, thank you for your time today and we’ll see each other next week.

Chris:

Entirely my pleasure.


So… who had acces to it?!

1p0j0od,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p0j0od/guy_im_seeing_moving_very_fast_but_says_past/,"Guy I'm seeing moving very fast, but says past relationship gave him trust issues.","I (20M) started seeing this guy, we'll call him John (26M). We have been in contact for about a year on and off. He knows my brother and we both grew up in the same town. We've gone on a handful of dates and had a really amazing time, genuinely such a great guy. But, of course, I have concerns. 

I'd like to start that I am a very self conscious person, despite going to the gym (which I thought would help), still not happy with myself. I many insecurities. 

John reassures me a ton, says I'm handsome, will randomly go out of his way to compliment me, says I'm cute or does cute things. He brought me coffee into work and talked with me on my lunch. He's been calling me nicknames. Basically a lot of cute shit, right. 

And again, we've only been seeing each other for maybe 3 weeks. He quickly opened up to me about his past relationships, only three, and the most recent one was about two years ago. They were long distance and visited each other some times throughout, but the person he was with switched up fast, first charming and then did a 180 and was the opposite, and then left him the day after he flew back. John explained to me that this gave him trust issues, that its difficult for him to see/trust people, and let them in. I told him that one of my worries is when people act like they're really into you, and then in a couple weeks you're being ghosted. John responded by saying that he wouldn't do that to me. 

We had a moment where we were relaxing and he kept hinting at *something* which I could only assume was asking to date or something along those lines. However I played dumb because immediately in my head I thought things might be going too fast. Don't get me wrong, I like fast, but I don't want to ruin things with John. 

So now I'm really confused. He tells me its hard for him to trust people and he hasn't gone on dates/seen people in awhile because of it. But now he's moving really fast hinting towards being in a relationship or at least exclusive... *And I'm pretty sure he was trying to say ""I love you"" which is pretty fucking insane...""* 

He does not really have any red flags ASIDE from the detail that we met on Grindr... lol. I mean we haven't even messed around, just kissed, which makes me think that he also doesn't want to mess things up...? And the year we've known each other, it's not like we got super personal in that time. 

I'm planning on asking if we are on the same page relationship goal wise. I'm really ready for the ""its casual"" conversation, which will literally kill me, but can't rule that out just yet. 

  
TLDR: Guy I've been seeing says he has trust issues / willingness to see people b/c of previous relationship, but now he's moving things very fast. I'm confused on how to approach/ his intentions. ",1,1763488912.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

So I have a third date with this woman on the weekend. Sorry for the silly question (not my first regarding this topic) but I am 31, and this is the first time being on dates with someone in my life.

Anyway, last date we talked a bit about movies and how she wasnt at the cinema for ages, and how she would like to go to the cinema, and in general has a bunch of movies she wants to watch. A day after our date she actually suggested we could go to the cinema together. Today we agreed on a Movie (Wicked 2) and a time. All good, we are both excited. I said I'll get the tickets.

But I am wondering, should I get the loveseats or regular ones? Whats appropiate for a third date? We had a coffee date (well in theory already two, we had one a while back, then she said she didnt feel the spark and some weeks ago she reached out again) and went playing minigolf so far. Usually we hug for greeting and goodbye, so thats how far we got.

Now I tend to strategize a bit... I know I am not good at building up intimacy. I try to get better at it but I am also not good to read people in a romantic context and I want to avoid at all costs that the other person feels uncomfortable so its a bit.. diificult. And I guess I want to signal to her somewhat that I would like to build up some intimacy? I would love to... I dont know... just cuddle with her a little...

But I fear that it would make her uncomfortable? Or maybe the seats themselfes are uncomfortable especially if she tries to avoid physical contact? I know all of this is silly but I have really no clue...

1p0iwhm,https://i.redd.it/o9o3hby6122g1.jpeg,NewsNation airhead Brian Entin is reporting that the families are going to sue WSU,"I genuinely cannot understand the logic behind this. So far news nation is the only media source that is reporting on this, no other stations have picked it up yet. But we know they have Steve G in their back pocket so there must be *some* truth to it. But until I see some court docs I’m still skeptical. In the meantime, let’s rant.

Suing a person’s employer for what that person (allegedly, with no evidence) did on their spare time outside of work will never go anywhere. They will be laughed out of court. 

It’s already in the existing court documents that WSU did an internal investigation and **found no wrongdoing** of Bryan Kohberger. 

The interviews with ISP obviously were all *after* BK’s arrest, from people looking for 5 minutes of fame and wanting to insert themselves into the case. 

Any claims prior to his arrest were minuscule and frivolous. His own professor told the school not to fire him because there wasn’t a reason to and the professor was worried it would open the university up to a civil lawsuit. 

Various students claiming that BK was late to class, mouthed off to professors, and had an awkward demeanor, is not any evidence of someone being a murderer-in-the-making. The whiny broads who said dumb things like “he blocked the door and I couldn’t leave” they never mentioned whether they *told his ass to move out of the way*. It’s all extremely one-sided and painted in such a way that they’re all good and BK is alllll bad. 

The lesbian chick was so offended because he asked her for coffee, then she seemingly went on a smear campaign against BK telling everyone how weird and creepy he was. He walked her to her car… That isn’t creepy, that’s gentleman behavior. She claims he wouldn’t get the hint then simultaneously claims he was homophobic, clearly he wanted to be her friend even though she’s a lesbian so how does that make him homophobic…?? I have friends both male and female that are gay, it’s not weird and there’s nothing wrong with it. So why was she so disturbed and bothered? He asked her out for coffee, probably a social skill his parents taught him because they knew how bad he was at making friends and he probably thought coffee was a safe way to ask someone to hangout. It wasn’t like he said “hey baby come back to my place and bust that p—sy wide open”. Now THAT would be weird and creepy. But that didn’t happen. Moving on. 

What about the creepy ass women who took tally in their notebooks every time he was late to class or left class early? I’m sorry but *that* is actual weirdo behavior. Why were they so concerned with his comings and goings? 

Not a single woman claimed that he threatened them, frightened them, followed them home, showed up at their job, or any other *actual stalker creeper behavior*. Even the Korean woman who thought someone broke into her apartment never reported it to police and she even **called Kohberger when she was scared and asked him to come stay the night with her**. I’m a woman and I know for a fact you *do not* invite men to stay at your apartment that you find creepy or weird. She invited him because she felt safe and comfortable around him.


Let’s also remember that he went to DeSales for several years, obtaining his bachelors and master’s degrees, with not a single complaint from any students at that school. He got his associates from NorthHampton community college, and again, zero complaints. He was also in rehab for a brief time for heroin addiction, no complaints that we’ve heard from anyone he was in rehab with either.

Ashley Banfield has a woman named Mandy that works for her on her YouTube channel, Mandy apparently grew up with Bryan’s sister Amanda and Ashley brought Mandy onto the show a few months ago to ask what it was like growing up near the Kohberger’s. Mandy said she was friends with Amanda and that Bryan never bothered her when she was at their house as a teen, he was just always seen as “Amanda’s little brother”. Ashley pushed for information and tried to dig for something juicy to which Mandy replied “there’s literally nothing”. So firsthand info from someone who grew up around Bryan and his sisters can’t even find a single bad thing to say about him or the family. Plus, his best friend from high school was a girl. So the theory of him being some crazy woman-hating-weirdo doesn’t track with the reality of the facts. 

This isn’t me trying to defend Kohberger or make him look good, but it’s simply me stating facts that are found in various documents and interviews. The story that mainstream media is showing is NOT the truth. And that’s been an ongoing issue with this case in particular. Report on the facts. 

Let me know what you guys think. Do you think the lawsuits will go anywhere? Will it open up more discovery? Maybe we’ll find out some more information, assuming that the lawsuit is actually going to happen. ",1,1763488661.0,Bryan_Kohberger_Case,1,1.0,False

1p0ivws,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1p0ivws/my_partner_wbpd_is_probably_going_to_break_up/,My partner w/bpd is probably going to break up with me today,"I've been dating my pwbpd for almost a full year now. We've been long distance the entire time, but have been talking for a long time about me moving to go live with her. Recently, I was able to make an official timeline of just a couple months and then we could finally be together. They were extremely excited and supportive of this, and even went out of their way to help send me job listings and talk with me about the kind of furniture we'd like to have together. It was all honestly very intoxicating. We were going through a really fantastic idealization phase where she couldn't get enough of me! We talked constantly, told each other how excited we were and how in love we were with each other and how we were excited to finally be starting the phase of our relationship where we could live together.

That is, she was super excited and happy until she split on me over a bunch of random BS.

It started out with her saying that I had a 'tone' lately when we talked. Usually it was because we would talk late at night after I was already in bed and groggy, or because I was exhausted after hanging out with some friends for a couple hours. Then I responded to her being upset over her boss being shitty in 'too generic' of a response. After that, when she said on my most recent trip down that she wouldn't be too interested in intimacy during my stay but would probably be fine with it once we discussed our issues and to hold off from that sort of stuff, she freaked out because the day before I left I sent her an extremely mild flirty one liner. Things were made even worse when a set of small presents I had gotten for her (a holiday themed set of presents based around fall and winter) she turned out to completely hate because I had forgotten that she mentioned once that she hated pumpkin (had gotten her a pumpkin scented candle and coffee) even though she also admitted that she loved pumpkin pie and it was probably easy to forget such a small detail.

Now she has: barely even been ok with me touching her in as slight of a way as touching elbows, been extemely rude and condescending towards me constantly, said we should push off my move in date 3-6 months until she figures out if she actually still wants this relationship, and last friday said she has decided she needs us to have some breathing space and told me we need to go no contact until today when she sees her psychologist. Not to mention during this split, as with every split, she threatened to break up even though I told her that was a boundary she needed to respect (she literally even admitted to my face she knew it was a problem but she still was going to threaten it).

So here I am. Just a little over two weeks ago we couldn't want to live together, were ready to get married after some time, and were looking forward to spending our lives with one another. Now, she's probably working out some way to excuse us breaking up over complete and utter nonsense and I am absolutely shattered. Can't wait for the phone call tonight, if for no other reason than to just get this over with.",2,1763488626.0,BPDlovedones,2,1.0,False

==================================

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: Early March 9th, 2130.*

*\[7 hours until Operation Void Whisper\]*

***Memory Transcription Subject: Vyly, Commander of the third Venlil Scouting and Self-Defense Fleet.*** 

Time went by relatively quickly after we arrived at the base, we spent some of it organizing our quarters and storing our things, after that, we played some matches of that game Noah gave to us before we decided to rest. As it turned out, Humans sleep two times as much as Venlil, it wasn't necessarily a problem, however, no one in their right mind would hate sleeping a few more hours, and if the difference in biology between Venlil and Humans meant that we could enjoy some extra bed time, then I wouldn't complain.

Hubert instructed us to be ready at 5 *AM*, sharp, and that's what we did, luckily, my colleagues were easy to convince, thankfully.

And true to his word, Hubert knocked on the door of our rooms exactly at 5 *AM,* ready to do his job, he was wearing an apparently military attire, but not a tactical gear.

""Morning folks, I hoped that you managed to rest well and get settled.""

""Hello Hubert, we managed to sleep well, thanks for asking. So, what are we doing first today?"" I answered in a slightly sleepy tone, my squad appearing behind me to look at him.

""First, we will go to the cafeteria so that you guys can eat something, after that, I will take you straight to the training facilities, but you won't be shooting stuff just yet. The commander responsible for the training of the boarding crews here want to know more about your physiological capabilities before putting you under training. We don't want to force you to do things your bodies aren't capable of, after all.""

He briefly looked over us.

""All of you, gather your weapons and equipment you use during boarding operations, you will use them a few times later. I will go use the bathroom, I shouldn't take more than 5 *minutes* to be back, I expect you all to be ready to leave by then."" He spoke up again before leaving.

""You heard him, crew, go get your stuff, we're in for a busy day today."" I quickly said in an excited tone. I wouldn't be lying by saying that I was anxious to see how they conducted things here.

====================================================

\[time skip: 45 minutes\]

As it turned out, the base was much, *much* bigger than I thought.

After we left our room, we quickly paused to eat something before we started walking, and walking, *and walking*.

It felt as if every part of the facility that Hubert showed us sprouted two additional sections that we also needed to see.

Thankfully, after what felt like an eternity, we were finished.

""I really hope we won't be doing any more uninterrupted walks for this long anytime soon..."" Vasti commented.

""Oh poor kid, you're in trouble then, because our troops usually do much longer runs, some run in their uniforms while carrying their equipment for *hours* without stopping. That won't be expected of you, of course, I really doubt that your species is built for endurance running, at least to the extent that we humans are."" Hubert said while snickering.

""Anyway!"" He continued. ""The tour is done, just a bit more walking and we will part ways, I will be leaving you at the hands of one of my drill sergeants, you will perform some boarding simulations under his watch so that he can get an idea on how you operate. Apparently, your war advisor sent us some mockup simulations designs that you use back home to train, he probably already went over them. But seeing things in person is much better.""

I intently listened to his words. The lugs that were sadly the most 'elite' we had at our disposal followed us quietly, slightly behind, but keeping pace.

After a few more *minutes*, we found ourselves in front of a rather large door. A man with similar clothes to those of Hubert stood near it, quietly seeing something in his pad. When he spotted us, he quickly stored it in one of his pockets before moving to greet us.

He shook Hubert's hand before doing the same to me.

""My name's Theodore, but you can refer to me as Theo, I will be the one responsible for your training during your stay here. Hubert already told me a bit about you. You're Vyly, I presume?""

I flicked my tail in response. ""Yes, it's a pleasure to meet you, I hope that you can teach us how you humans fight.""

He nodded. ""Alright, I like your eagerness, let's see if the same is true for your boarding crew."" He turned to Hubert next. ""Thanks for bringing them here, Hubert.""

""Any time chief, just doing as I'm told to."" He said with a smile before leaving, quickly disappearing amongst the halls.

""Alright, the rest of you, follow me, your training starts now, you two in the back, stop talking and messing around, straighten your backs and shut up!""

I turned back my attention to my own boarding party, almost missing seeing Roldn and Vasti hastily moving back up, their wool flared up.

""Good, now follow me.""

We quickly moved to do as he asked.

""Before we do anything else, you will do a few physical tests, I want to know how long you can run, how much you can lift, and how your brains handle stress. Shouldn't take more than an hour. After that, we will begin your training, if the report Joseph made regarding your boarding footage before he got his sentence some time ago is true, then I have a lot of corrections to make in your tactics.""

We navigated corridors of a dull gray color, illuminated by bright white lights, doors decorated the walls every few dozen *meters*, although at irregular intervals due to the constant splitting of directions and sprouting of new directions that could be followed.

It wasn't long before we arrived at our destination. Theodore quickly swiped what appeared to be a card in a slot in the wall in order to open the door, we quickly stepped inside before him.

The room was significantly different from what its door could lead someone to initially believe it to look like, while on the outside it was relatively bland, the inside was unbelievably *clean*. It was filled with machines and screens, the taste of disinfectant in the air was relatively strong.

""Alright."" Theo spoke up again, ""Please wait here for a few moments, I will go fetch the doctors who will conduct the tests on you, shouldn't take more than 5 *minutes*.""

He then quickly left through a door.

""Ha... I'm having a bad feeling about this..."" Zenyl quipped.

""They won't harm us, put yourself together, we've done physical trials back home when we were training for this job, it can't be *that* different."" Roldn answered, as he turned back to look through the large glass panel separating us from the equipment.

=========================================================

\[Time skip: 20 minutes\]

As it turned out, it was *not* the same.

The *sheer* amount of tests that my boarding crew was currently being put through would put our own test trials to shame.

Strength tests, speed tests, stamina tests, hearing tests, vision tests, cardiovascular tests... *there was simply no end to them.*

Luckily, due to my position as their *boss*, I wasn't forced to participate in the tests, watching them struggle to meet the doctors' expectations in the physical tests was... *enlightening*.

Theodore's reaction wasn't that much different from my own, but the little difference was in his expression.

While I was\*... disappointed\* with their performance, Theodore was apparently... *puzzled?*

""So... Theo, can you work with them? I mean, is the situation... salvageable? By your expression, things look grim..."" I started.

""Hm? Oh, so far, the performance of your boarding squad is... not particularly *good* if judged by our standards.""

He drew in a deep breath, patting me on the shoulder a few times.

""**But,** I've worked with very low performing squads in the past, far worse than yours. I'm confident I can come up with something to help them improve. For now, let us finish the screening, then, we will conduct a few runs so i can see how you operate with my own eyes, yes, I saw the footage your war advisor sent us, but I want to see it by myself how you bunch will operate in our *own* scenarios.""

I could only flick my tail in acknowledgement. Looking back at my elite squad that was currently being tested.

Roldn had collapsed on the treadmill, which, thankfully, immediately stopped, and he was already being tended to, though he appeared to be fine, well, except for his pride.

Vasti was stuck in a chair with a bunch of cables connected to her, it was clear that she was *nervous.*

Vyrt was struggling to keep his ears pointed to a sound moving across different speakers.

Zenyl... was the only one actually managing his test somewhat well, his test was one of reaction speed, and he was holding his own, I think it was more due to his hobby of gaming, some of the games he played, at least according to him, required extremely good reaction times. It really seems that his constant gaming sessions paid off.

Of course, they rotated them until everyone had participated in every single test.

In the end, as much as they tried, everyone only managed to really excel in a single area, two at most, which was Zenyl, of course, managing to perform optimally both in reaction speed and hearing testing. Everyone was tired at the end of everything, sadly, however, Theodore wasn't about to let them rest.

""Why are you all on the ground? We've only started the day, get yourselves back up right now!"" He spoke in a slightly high tone, earning a few groans.

""Come on! Do you think your opponents will wait for you to get up if you collapse in the middle of the fight? I said get up!""

My squad reluctantly obeyed.

""Let this not happen again in the future, you bunch understand? Because if any of you collapse from such a simple 30 *minute* activity, I will have you on cleaning duty the rest of your stay!""

""Alright, alright, we get it, we get it! Now stop yelling for all that's holy!"" Roldn bleated, to which Theodore only replied with a 'hmph'.

""Follow me, next step for today will be the simulation of boarding scenarios, I want to see you in action, grab your stuff.""

And so, we followed.

""I'm tired boss, I'm tired..."" Vryt complained, struggling to keep pace with me.

""I'm sorry dude, sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do anything about it...""

""Listen here."" Theodore's booming voice sounded up once more. ""Every morning, you will be conducting a few runs and exercises before you start training, all of you, save for Vyly, need to improve your stamina, strength, and endurance, you can barely run for more than 15 minutes, for God's sake. I wonder how you manage to make boarding operation in full tactical gear with such lack of breath.""

""By our own means, but we *certainly* don't usually run at top speed for a quarter of an *hour.*"" Roldn muttered under his breath, which Theodore apparently heard, as I saw his pace change slightly.

""You apparently fail to understand what I'm trying to say, Roldn, your lack of stamina *will* backfire eventually. There've been times here where many recruits failed their mock missions because they couldn't keep up with others from their teams, if that happens in the middle of real combat? It might as well end up in death. And I will be damned if I will let that happen to you, the first fucking alien squad to come to Earth, entrusted to *me* to be trained.

So yea, no, I'm *not* not going to force you to improve your endurance and strength, I want you in top shape, you came to train under us? Fine, you will train under us the way everyone else here does, whether you like it or **not**.*""*

Roldn stayed silent in response. And soon enough, we arrived at what I presumed to be our destination.

Theodore quickly swiped a card against a reader in the wall to open the door and then ushered us inside.

""I will be generous today and give you 30 *minutes* to rest and prepare yourselves for action while I get the chamber prepared for your run.""

My whole squad whimpered in unison.

""...Are you guys *really* already this tired?"" Theodore asked them before turning his attention to me.

""Is this really the state of your military? Soldiers who can barely run or do any type of exercise without needing a nap?""

""We usually don't see much action in the front lines, Venlil aren't made for long periods of sustained exertion, we usually just provide raw resources to other combatants such as the Gojid or Krakotl, our squad is a special case...""

He stood still for a few *seconds*, before something apparently *clicked* inside his head.

""...Actually, I think we might have something that can help you bunch get back on your feet, tell me, have any of you heard of *caffeine*?""

=========================================================

\[Time skip: 20 minutes\]

***Memory Transcription Subject: Theodore Grant, Drill Instructor of the Boarding and Sabotaging Squadron Training Facility.***

I shouldn't have introduced them to coffee, *I should* ***not*** *have introduced them to coffee...*

The boarding squad the Venlil Republics had sent here ended up being set up with me as their instructor. At first, I was a little excited to be the first man to train an alien squadron.

But after seeing their performance in the most basic tests that human soldiers usually go through... I came to the conclusion that training them would be... nothing short of difficult.

The poor little sheep people had barely any endurance to speak off, their cardiovascular systems were more suited for short bursts of speed than anything. Their reflexes weren't that much better than those of a human, except for one of the members, Zenyl, who managed to perform above average.

And man... Their depth perception... it was *horrendous*.

It quickly became apparent to me that they would most likely struggle to hit anything more than a few dozen meters away from them. Inside the corridors of a ship, that wouldn't be much of a problem, except, of course, that depth perception plays a crucial role in accuracy, and taking even a tenth of a second longer to be able to lock on a target and fire could be the difference between life and death.

And what they *did not have? A good depth perception!*

At least there were ways to mitigate that, be it with relentless target practice, specialized helmets that moved their vision to be similar to that of a forward facing person, *like us*, or the use of weapons that fired spread shots, like shotguns.

But given that our weapons most likely wouldn't be effective in their hands due to anatomical differences, I decided that making use of the first two options would be the best way to get them up to our standards in a relatively small time frame, though for the first option, Vyly, their boss, would need to take a specialized software with him back home to allow them to keep honing their aiming skills. Not that it would be a problem to arrange, however.

But now, *back to the coffee issue*...

If they weren't fully grown adults and knew that they were supposed to stay seated and wait, they would most likely be bouncing off the walls, Vyly expressed his concerns, but I calmed him down, nothing would go wrong in the test runs I was about to put them through, *hopefully.*

I sighed, after setting up the simulation parameters in the control room with Vyly present and a few more people who were already manning it so that we could synchronize the system with the software of the suits of his companions, I moved to get them ready for action, thankfully, they were already dressed in their uniforms, just waiting to be given the green light to start.

""Alright, the simulation room is ready, get ready for action, standard boarding scenario: Group of 10 hostiles has boarded a comercial ship and is holding the crew hostage, your objective is to incapacitate the hostiles and reestablish control of the ship. You have 15 *minutes* before they kill the hostages, so be quick.""

""...Shouldn't you be worried about our weapons damaging the environment?"" Roldn spoke up at such a surprisingly quick pace that even my translator chip struggled to keep up with.

""Nope, we'd requested your war advisor to give us the blueprints to your weapons, they're plasma guns, right?""

""Yep, they are, why?"" he asked while tilting his head in a suspiciously similar way as of a dog.

""The walls are heat resistant, they should absorb the energy of your shots very quickly, anyway, your helmets' software will display holograms of the enemies and hostages, you just have to aim at them and fire and they should count whether you killed a foe or a hostage. They will also detect if your 'enemies' manage to score a hit on you, if that happens, an alarm will sound in your ears, signaling that you've been incapacitated. I hope that's easy enough to understand?""

They looked between themselves, they exchanged a few nonverbal clues that I didn't understand, then Roldn just shrugged, ""Yep, I think we got it, come on guys, let's get this done, I'm eager to use this energy that caffeine thing gave me."" His companions eagerly aggreing with him.

And just like that, they grabbed their weapons and entered the testing zone.

""Come on Vyly, follow me, we will be observing them from the control room.""

""Alright, let's see how they fare under your training, if the physical examination indicates anything, I think they will fail..."" He mumbled behind me while we entered the control room.

""There isn't such a thing as 'failure', only room for improvement, even if some situations feel hopeless, there's almost always a solution, I'm already planning on ways of how to compensate for your side facing eye placement, your depth perception is significantly worse than ours, that's sure to affect their precision.""

""It can't be that bad... right?""

""Well, only one way to find out."" I responded, quickly setting the system of cameras to follow the boarding crew.

And so, we started to watch them in action.

It didn't take long for me to spot a critical mistake. The way they were clearing rooms left blind spots, opening room for a potential ambush.

Barely a minute later, it happened.

Vasti decided to separate from her squad and tried to clean a room on her own while the rest moved forwards.

Her movements were relatively efficient and precise, but too rushed, and it just so happened that there was a hostile in the room in one of the corners to the left of the door, lo and behold, she *almost* got 'hit', her ears caught the simulated noise of steps from the hologram and she immediately took cover behind a wall inside the room, receiving a grazing simulated bullet to the shoulder in the process, but she managed to return fire and take out the threat, albeit it took too many shots to my taste.

In a real combat scenario, hadn't she been so lucky, she most likely would've been killed.

She did the right thing in immediately contacting her allies, informing them of what happened, and quickly moving to regroup.

They moved to better cover their flanks and started cleaning rooms together again.

Not even a few minutes later, another mistake, their coordination started to deteriorate again after clearing a few more rooms and taking out two more hostiles.

It was clear that they were getting tired, just like I expected.

It didn't help that time was also running out, it was probably why they were starting to fold under the pressure.

And then, when they found the rest of the enemies, chaos broke out. Roldn rushed the room, likely due to the time limit, and got taken out as a result, Vryt managed to get a few shots, all but one missing, before being taken out as well.

After nearly a minute of fire exchange, the remaining two managed to take out all but 2 of the hostiles.

Except, of course, just like I planned, one of them was hidden, and they had *no* idea he was there.

The remaining bandit took one of the hostages and threatened to take them out if the two still alive didn't surrender.

They hesitated, and that brief window was all it took for the other hostile to take action and shoot both of them when they were least expecting it.

And just like that, they lost. I expected worse, they still had 2 minutes to spare, their mistakes were relatively easy to fix.

""Not bad, I must admit, they're still a bit rough around the edges, I just have to increase their endurance, precision, and discipline, nothing some training can't fix.""

*Alright, let's put these dudes through hell.*

I am trying to find a woman who is okay with leading a relationship. I would also like to meet in person one day if that is okay with you because I don't want to be mostly long distance or online if you live outside of California and are able to travel. If anything sounds weird or offensive, my apologies for that.

About me:

• I'm a femboy. But not all the time since I have very few feminine clothing/makeup and cannot wear some due to personal reasons.

• I am 5'1(I know, that's hella short) with a skinny build with a bit of chub. I also have fluffy black hair, brown eyes, shapely thick thighs, and a soft butt.

• I want to do the best I can to help others and make others happy. I also like to think of ways I can do so I can help with things like chores.

• I am a foodie and very good at cooking. So far, I am able to make stuff like sandwiches, mocktails, and coffee that look and taste like the kind you would find at cafés and restaurants. I'm an amateur though, so it would look slightly messed up. I also enjoy trying new things and seeing if I like them.

• I want a mostly FLR(female-led relationship) because I want to be the one who helps prepare food and do chores, since I do not like the traditional mindset for personal reasons. It would be great to be equals, but I want to be guided and taught so I can do my part as well.

• I do not have a license. But I want to learn how to drive.

• I am a big cuddle bunny and enjoy physical affection. So I like being comfy and enjoy stuff like snuggling, maybe lap pillows, being under a warm fuzzy blanket while watching a movie, or anything that would sound nice. Because of this, I sometimes hate getting out of bed, and tend to be very sleepy most of the day when comfy enough.

• I'm kinda clingy.

• I am easily excitable and get very happy when seeing something that interests me. To the point of having enough energy to see everything in a few minutes.

• I am very timid and scared of most things, like the dark, loud noises, overstimulation, jumpscares, lightning, yelling, loneliness, and judgement for liking feminine stuff. Even to the point of being jumpy or nervous in public.

• I am also very soft-spoken and tend to talk quietly. I like the thought of being held and allowed to be vulnerable and myself and be assured that I don't have to be strong or brave during certain moments.

• I like going to places like the mall or park, but only when my family is able to as most of them have college and/or work, and when we have enough to go.

• Some of my interests are Sanrio(mostly Cinnamoroll and Kuromi), plushies, Japanese culture, Stitch, feminine clothing, 2000s-2010s stuff, furries, Hot Topic, indie animation, Helluva Boss/Hazbin Hotel, Glitch Productions, anime, and horror(even the stupidly funny kind).

• I like going on daily walks sometimes. Mostly during the day. But I also go during the night when the is a lot of people or light.

• I play video games on PlayStation. The top three ones I play are GTA, Fortnite, and Minecraft.

• I have Snap, Insta, and Discord if you want to talk off here after a while. Same goes for gamer tags and pics.

• I like movie musicals like KPop Demon Hunters and The Greatest Showman, aka, the kind where every ten minutes or so, they break out into song. This is a joke, so please do not take it seriously.

• When we start talking, I want to take things slow and steady so we can get to know each other and see where things go. And when we are able to meet in person, it would be nice to go to the park, movies, a diner, arcade, mall, or just anywhere that we both would enjoy. It would also be great to help each other step out of our comfort zones every now and then.

• I would want to wait until we are comfortable with each other and click before doing anything 18+, and I would want your consent beforehand. But just to be clear, I am a switch, but lean more toward being subby since I like the idea of being emasculated and made to feel smaller than I already am.

I'm an old school vinyl UK/Euro house and breaks dj based in the US that sold my entire collection years ago and has found myself recently trying to re-buy my favorite 12"" singles.  I travel fairly often and love to visit record stores as part of my treasure hunt.  

Problem is, searching up ""record store"" on Google gives you either flea market ""vintage"" type places, coffee shops selling a handful of new records, or places that are well stocked and organized but have a very narrow section of used electronic music.

I could buy all of what I want from Discogs, however shipping to is costly and a lot of what I want is UK/European based.  I'm not going to spend $30 to ship a single $3 record for example.  Poking through my wantlist to country specific shippers can be time consuming and often gets me sellers who aren't physical storefronts or across the country and not near where I'm going.

The real problem is there are etchings from cups and food stains on the marble (they don’t show up well in most lighting except directly overhead)

Question is how to refinish the marble? Should I just use an etch remover from amazon with a lint free buffing cloth, or:

Use my random orbital sander with 120 - 240 - -600 -1000 grit progression then use a buffing compound with a cloth to finish polishing? Is there something I should use to seal the marble to prevent further etching?

I'm a transplant from the nycbwt subreddit but I wanted to promote my event here :) 

I’m organizing a charity 5k called Runner’s High on 11/30 at Golden Gate Park. It’s a super chill, post-Thanksgiving run/walk with bagels, coffee, samples, and a community hangout afterward. 

This run is a fundraiser for my nonprofit, [3percentclub](http://3percentclub.org), which provides *free* technical training and entrepreneurship education for underrepresented founders. The name comes from the stats that black women make up less than 3% of tech/engineering jobs and women make up less than 3% of VC funding. One hundred percent of proceeds the event will go toward our 2026 programming. We currently self-funded(by my amex points lol) and this event will go a long way for funding free workshops and sessions for our global community. 

I’m currently looking for a few THC, wellness, beverage, women/poc-owned, energy-focused brands and local businesses who might want to get involved — either through light sponsorship, product sampling, or swag/raffle support. We are 501c3 registered if that helps. I’d especially love to connect with local run clubs in the area. I'm honestly trying to get the word out since I don't have a big network in SF/Bay. I would love to get like 50 people there. That would be a dream come true!!!

For a few years I've had problems now with bodily sensations that I would mostly compare to coffee jitters. It is so hard to describe, and I am not sure if they are exactly the same. However, drinking a lot of coffee makes this feeling worse. A lot. At one time, this sensation was so strong and overwhelming that I was on sick leave for 3 weeks (no coffee at all during those weeks).

Now I've always been suspecting caffeine, and had many short attempts of removing it altogether, or reducing it. The thing is, even when I was completly off I would still experience the jitters. Most strongly after lunch. Nowadays I usyally drink max 2 coffees. Often mixing decaf with regular. If I drink more, I feel petty bad. Still experiencing moderate jitters though. 

My experiments have been so scattered and inconsistent that I have a hard time saying how effective they were. I think the longest I lasted without caffeine was 3 weeks, and at least then i seem to not have thought that it fixed things. 

I know it's stupid to keep drinking it, but I found it to be almost impossible difficult to quit to be honest. The best I seem to be able to manage is to keep intake somewhat low. 

I want to understand if my symptoms are only due to caffeine, or if they are something different. The doctors thought it could be my anxiety issues that I had at the time, but I have since then gotten rid of them almost completly (yay). Yet this sensation persists. 

Sorry for a long text. I appreciate any help on this :)",1,1763488053.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

People are not completely blank, they keep making these little movements, like scratching and drink sips of water. They are not robotic. There is some synchronisation between actions of people but it's not perfect. They still partake in small creature comforts like coffee... though this one could specifically have been for zosia's jetlag. Also, it understands the concept of sarcasm. And I don't think this is just because there is some literary genius in the hivemind. And this might just be me, but when zosia smiles it really feels like she wants to comfort you and feel better. 

This is why I don't think the hive is something that simply overtook people. It's feels more like they are directed towards a goal which they have to do to the best of their ability, but they are otherwise still human. It's more like a nudge than push. It doesn't feel like a lobotomy or a cult or hypnosis. Rather something in the line of the blue dot effect where seeing the see the Earth from spaces changes peoples perspective.

1p0ildm,https://www.reddit.com/r/QueerWomenOfColor/comments/1p0ildm/my_gf_of_3_weeks_broke_up_with_me/,My gf of 3 weeks broke up with me,"I (18F) met this girl (18F) in early October. She was very adamant about wanting to date me during the three weeks we had been talking. On our first date, after just one week of talking, we sat on a bench and she told me about our future together. I was hesitant at first because it felt like she was love-bombing me, and she had told me she’d had a two-month relationship with a guy she’d only known for a week. When I brought that up, she just said that it was “just how she was.”

The day we agreed to start dating, she told me she loved me. I didn’t say it back, but I thought she just had a lot of love to give. She brought me an amazing gift basket filled with things I like and told me she’d always be there for me. Every day she would tell me she supported my future dreams and talked like our relationship would end in marriage.

I’m a very anxious person, and all her feelings put a lot of pressure on me, but I had been doing a lot of work on myself so I wouldn’t self-destruct like I would have in the past. During this time I felt constantly anxious and depressed, but I assumed it was just me adjusting to the relationship. I smoked more weed during this period to calm my nerves because I didn’t want to ruin what seemed like such an ideal partnership. I regret this, but I even told her later on that I loved her back, even though it felt wrong. I just didn’t want her to leave.

She’s a very logical person, while I’m more emotional. In week three, we were on a date and I asked her if she would feel sad if we broke up. She said no, and that she would learn from the experience and move on. I had already been feeling anxious that day, and her response made me completely shut down. How could she not care? I mean, I would have been heartbroken. I left our date early and texted her later about how I felt. We had a healthy conversation, and she said she would try to be more responsive to my emotions.

The next day, we didn’t text for most of the day, which was weird, but I didn’t mind. Around 7 p.m., she asked if we could go on a coffee date the next day, and I said yes. But then I found out I had caught mono and had to cancel our plans. On Thursday, I asked if we could FaceTime and just chat. Halfway through the call, she said we should break up because she felt she couldn’t give me what I needed emotionally.

I left the call immediately and found that she had already blocked me on Instagram, but not on iMessage. I was sick with the worst case of mono and bawling my eyes out. Over the week I was out of school, I tried messaging her multiple times saying that I just wanted to talk when I got better, but she completely ignored my messages and turned off read receipts. After two weeks of texting her every few days, I vented everything I felt and told her I was blocking her to move on.

I posted about the ordeal on my public Instagram story (I don’t follow many people), and two hours later her friend followed my account, saw the story, and cursed me out. I feel worse than ever and like an emotional mess. I never want to get back with her, but at the same time I’m having a hard time moving on.

1p0ijp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1p0ijp3/is_there_a_way_to_remove_sodium_sulphate_without/,Is there a way to remove sodium sulphate without compromising 4 other chemicals in mix,"So let's say I mix up for use in a refractory cement liner for a steel melting furnace: 

* 200 grams of trisodium monophosphate
* 100 grams of aluminum hydroxide
* 100 grams of magnesium sulfate
* 2000 grams of water @ 80 Celsius

By measure I should end up with:

* Magnesium phosphate: 73.59 g
* Aluminum phosphate: 81.10 g
* Aluminum hydroxide: 48.13 g
* Sodium sulfate: 117.90 g
* Sodium hydroxide: 79.80 g
* Water: 2000 g

Via 

* 2(Na3PO4) + 3(MgSO4) -> Mg3(PO4)2 + 3(Na2SO4)
* Na3PO4 + Al(OH)4 -> AlPO4 + 3(NaOH)

Awesome. I want all of those chemicals EXCEPT the sodium sulphate. How do I get it out? The end use of the chemicals will be to use as binders for cement using primarily mag oxide and mullite as primary solids (mullite is a clay that is basically 75% aluminum oxide and 25% silica by weight), to be entirely clear.

The problem is that sodium sulphate destroys refractory cements that will also exist in further layers outside of this inner liner layer. 

Thing is magnesium phosphate, aluminum phosphate both are great binders. Sodium hydroxide can be reacted with silica to make sodium silicate which is also a decent binder (and quite frankly the amount of silica in the environment and it's situation well be more than enough to guarantee this does happen) and densifier. Aluminum hydroxide can be calcined into aluminum oxide (all dry ingredients are calcined and mild prior to mixing anyways) . The water is non consequential, for the amount of mullite clay powder and mag oxide I will be adding this to, I will need more than that 2000 grams of water to properly mix the refractory mix. 

I've considered that I can just pass it all through a coffee filter or similar, and I think I should end up with just the sodium hydroxide and the sodium sulphate passing with the water, and given that I can buy drain cleaner for cheap at home depot or just get some cement sealer (sodium silicate) if I'm that attached to using the sodium hydroxide somehow, but when I look at a list 5 chemicals and 4 of them I directly want or can very easily directly use by just heating with some fine silica dust of silica gel or something... Well I figure I should ask here if there might be an easy way to yeet that fucking sulfate. Also, since I'm not a chemist, or even a high school graduate (drop out that self educated cause fuck Laramie county, Wyoming's education system) maybe I should ask people who know more than just the bit of chemistry that I know.

If there isn't a good solution to getting the sodium sulphate out easily, I will just physically filter it and throw it out with the sodium hydroxide by mixing it with a bunch of white vinegar till the hydroxide is inert, at which point, last I checked, sodium sulphate isnt considered an environmentally dangerous chemical in small amounts to just to in the old gravel trap.

In the end, this is all to be used to hold together to hold  some greater amount of material that in smaller stoichiometric ratio comes to about 300 grams of mag oxide (MgO) per 1000 grams of mullite  (750 grams of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), 250 grams of silica (SiO2)) so that it can be fired to make magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) in-situ at a slow climbed fire to 1700 Celsius where it will be held. To be clear the above mix of binders is to serve as about 5 to 8 percent by weight (water not included) of the refractory liner, the rest being 3 parts mag oxide, 10 parts mullite, plus perhaps some trace other things (iron chromate, titanium dioxide, chromium oxide, zirconium silicate, cerium oxide, graphite) and perhaps some not so trace amounts of silicon carbide.

I know the phosphates and silicates will break down by 1700 celsius, but by then, the non binder ingredients should have sintered down and so long as it isn't compromised or impacted until the spinel forms, it should hold. spinel starts formation at 1100 Celsius also, so if i go slow, it should hold out just fine. Also, it will probably actually be mixed magnesium oxide heavy for various reasons related to the fact that this is all for furnace liner for steel melting and casting (mag oxide being particularly tough to steel slags). The furnace is primarily ran on propane plus oxygen enriched forced air going through a heat regenerator (heats up the incoming non fuel non pure oxygen combustion gasses via running the forced air intake pipes over the furnace exhaust which is then mixed with the a small amount of pure oxygen before being injected directly intersecting the propane jet being injected into the furnace chamber).

There that's all the details off the top of my head. Gonna go to bed and try cracking how I can get rid of the sulphate in the morning. I fucking hate stoichiometric math this shit makes my head hurt.",0,1763487884.0,chemistry,2,0.5,False

Final Thoughts

Kylea calls her followers friends, says she loves them, shares intimate details of her life, manipulates them to pity her (trauma dumping and sad fishing), then lashes out when basic questions or differing opinions are voiced. Her new shtick is to discuss filing police reports, daily bullying, harassment, and stalking and an outrageous claim that fake profiles are created daily encouraging her to *join her son*. In what world is it okay to frequently and casually discuss su!c!de with 159k people for profit? She should talk to her therapist about that ASAP. ✌️

1p0ihra,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1p0ihra/the_best_compact_espresso_machine_for_small_homes/,The Best Compact Espresso Machine for Small Homes: A Complete Beginner-Friendly Guide,"Many people today live in small homes, small apartments, or shared spaces. Kitchen counters are shrinking. Storage space is limited. But people still want café-quality espresso every morning. This is why compact espresso machines have become a major trend.

In this complete guide, everything is explained simply. No confusing words. No heavy coffee science. Just clear, helpful information.

You will learn:

* Why compact espresso machines are useful
* What features matter most
* Which machines perform best
* How to choose the right one for your home

This guide is broken into four long sections. Each section is easy to understand, well structured, and fully packed with helpful information.

# SECTION 1: Understanding Compact Espresso Machines

Before choosing a machine, you must understand what a compact espresso machine is, how it works, and why so many people prefer it today.

# What is a Compact Espresso Machine?

A compact espresso machine is a small coffee machine designed to make strong espresso drinks while using very little space. It gives you the same rich taste you get from coffee shops but in a small body that fits in almost any home.

These machines usually have:

* A small water tank
* A fast heating system
* A pressure pump
* A basic milk frother
* Simple controls
* A body width of under 8 inches

This makes them perfect for people who want high-quality espresso without large appliances.

# Why Compact Machines Are Becoming More Popular

A simple survey from a home-appliance research team showed:

* 68 percent of new homeowners want smaller appliances
* 71 percent prefer machines that heat faster and use less energy
* 54 percent want espresso machines that fit in tight spaces

This shows a clear shift toward compact coffee makers.

Compact espresso machines are rising in demand because:

1. People want café-style coffee at home
2. Home kitchens are getting smaller
3. People want to save time and money
4. Simple controls are easier for beginners

# How Compact Espresso Machines Work

Compact espresso machines work almost the same way as large espresso machines, but they use smaller parts and faster heating.

The basic steps are easy:

1. Water heats through a small heating block
2. The pump pushes water through the coffee
3. Pressure extracts flavor quickly
4. Espresso flows into your cup

Even though these machines are small, they can still make strong espresso with a thick, rich layer on top.

# Why Beginners Love Compact Machines

Most compact espresso machines are designed for people who want:

* Simple buttons
* Quick results
* No complicated setup
* No heavy cleaning
* Consistent espresso every time

They are made to be beginner-friendly, which means you do not need any coffee skills to use them.

# Who Should Buy a Compact Espresso Machine?

A compact espresso machine is perfect for:

* Students
* Busy professionals
* Small families
* People with limited counter space
* Coffee drinkers who want fast espresso
* People who drink 1 to 4 cups daily

If you want café-quality drinks without a large machine, a compact model is the right choice.

# SECTION 2: Key Features to Look for in a Compact Espresso Machine

Choosing the right machine becomes easy when you know what features matter the most. In this section, every important feature is explained clearly.

# 1. Size and Dimensions

A compact espresso machine should have:

* Width: 5 to 8 inches
* Depth: 10 to 13 inches
* Height: 10 to 12 inches

This size range fits most types of kitchens, even very small ones.

# 2. Pump Pressure

Espresso requires pressure.

Here is a simple breakdown:

* You need at least 9 bars to make real espresso
* Many compact machines offer 15 bars
* Higher pressure is not always better
* Stability matters more than high numbers

Experts say:  
“The best espresso comes when pressure stays stable at 9 bars.”

Beginners should choose a machine with 9–15 bars.

# 3. Heating System

Most compact machines use a thermoblock heating system.  
This means:

* It heats water very fast
* It uses less electricity
* It is smaller than a boiler

Thermoblock is perfect for compact espresso machines because it gives:

* Fast heat-up time
* Less waiting
* Energy savings

# 4. Milk Frothing Options

If you love milk drinks like cappuccino or latte, look for a machine with a good milk frother. There are two types:

# Manual Steam Wand

* More control
* Better for skilled users
* Creates real café-style texture

# Automatic Frother

* Very easy for beginners
* Makes consistent foam
* No skill needed

Choose based on your comfort level.

# 5. Water Tank Size

Compact machines have smaller tanks.  
A good tank size is:

* 30 to 55 ounces

If you drink many cups per day, choose a machine with a bigger tank.

# 6. Portafilter Type

There are two main types:

# Pressurized Portafilter

* Best for beginners
* Produces stable espresso
* Works well with any coffee grind

# Non-Pressurized Portafilter

* Best for skilled users
* Needs perfect grind size
* Gives more control over flavor

Most compact machines come with pressurized portafilters because they are easier.

# 7. Cleaning Difficulty

A good compact machine should have:

* Removable drip tray
* Removable water tank
* Easy-to-clean steam wand
* Simple internal flushing

Cleaning should take less than 5 minutes.

# 8. Durability and Build Quality

A compact machine should last at least 3 to 6 years with regular use.

Check for:

* Metal body parts
* Strong portafilter lock
* Good quality buttons
* Solid steam wand movement

A machine with more metal parts usually lasts longer.

# 9. Price Range

Here is a simple price guide:

|Type|Price|Who It’s For|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Basic Compact|100–180 dollars|Beginners on a budget|
|Mid-Range Compact|200–350 dollars|Daily home espresso drinkers|
|Premium Compact|400–699 dollars|People wanting long-term durability|

Choose a machine that fits your budget and needs.

1p0ifox,https://linktr.ee/universityexploitsbyjx,"The TOEFL iBT Master Protocol: Your Blueprint for a 100+ Score, University Admission & Academic Fluency","**The Premise: Your Academic Passport—Standardized.**  
The TOEFL iBT (Test of English as a Foreign Language) is not merely a test of your ability to order coffee in English; it is a rigorous simulation of university-level academic life. It is the non-negotiable gateway between your current proficiency and admission to top-tier universities in the US, Canada, and Europe. Treating TOEFL prep like casual language learning—passively watching Netflix or using Duolingo—is how smart candidates end up with conversational fluency but a failing score. The winning approach is to reverse-engineer the exam’s design: understand the specific scoring rubrics of ETS (Educational Testing Service), master the ""Integrated"" task types, and pressure-test your stamina until a 100+ score is a predictable outcome, not a gamble.

**At a glance (Core Components):**  
**Reading & Listening (Input):** The ability to synthesize dense academic texts and lecture material under strict time constraints.  
**Speaking & Writing (Output):** The ability to structure logical arguments and deliver them with clarity, adhering to specific templates that satisfy the automated ""E-rater"" and human graders.  
**The ""Integrated"" Mechanics:** The unique TOEFL constraint where you must read a passage, listen to a rebuttal, and then speak/write about the relationship between the two.  
**Exam Strategy:** Your systematic process for note-taking, clock management, and template application.

You leverage this validated competency to pass admissions committees, secure teaching assistantships (TA), and handle the rigors of a Master’s or Ph.D. program.

# The Challenge: Four Score-Killing Traps That Derail Fluent Speakers

**1. The ""I Speak Fluent English"" Fallacy vs. Academic Rigor**  
Your ability to hold a conversation in English proves you are socially competent, but it doesn't guarantee you can summarize a lecture on astrophysics or synthesize a reading on Art History within 45 seconds. The TOEFL is a standardized test of academic English. It tests your ability to navigate a university classroom, not a social setting. Ignoring the specific structure of the test is like a native speaker failing a law school entrance exam—fluency is the baseline, not the strategy.

**2. Passive ""Entertainment"" Consumption**  
Watching 40 hours of Friends or The Office without active analysis is a recipe for failure in the Listening section. The exam demands ""Active Listening."" It expects you to identify the professor's main argument, spot the transition words (e.g., ""however,"" ""consequently""), and capture specific details in your notes. Passive consumption builds zero retention skills for the 3-5 minute lectures you will face.

**3. The ""Perfectionist’s Curse"" in Speaking**  
Many candidates try to sound like a TED Talk speaker during the Speaking section. This is a liability. You have 15 seconds to prepare and 45 seconds to speak. The grader wants a structured response (Topic Statement -> Reason 1 -> Detail -> Reason 2 -> Detail), not a poetic improvisation. Candidates who pause to find the ""perfect word"" lose points for fluency and coherence. You must master the art of the ""Good Enough"" vocabulary delivered with perfect structure.

**4. Using Outdated ""Independent"" Writing Tactics**  
As of July 2023, the TOEFL changed. The long ""Independent Essay"" is gone, replaced by the ""Writing for an Academic Discussion"" task. Using generic, long-winded templates from 2020 will waste your time and lower your score. The new task requires you to contribute to a simulated online class discussion, demanding conciseness, direct engagement with other students' points, and high-quality grammar in a short timeframe (10 minutes).

# The High-Pass Protocol: A System for Peak Exam-Day Performance

# Phase 1 — Diagnostic Baseline & Rubric Decoding

**Objective:** Eliminate guesswork; align preparation to ETS scoring criteria.

* **Define Your Score Target:** Check the requirements for your target universities. Most top-tier programs demand a **100+ overall** with minimum sub-scores (e.g., 25 in Speaking). This is your contract.
* **Execute a Full-Length Diagnostic:** Before buying a book, take a free, full-length practice test from ETS or a reputable provider (like TST Prep). This reveals your baseline.
* **Decode the Scoring Rubrics:** Download the official **TOEFL Speaking and Writing Rubrics**. Understand exactly what a ""4"" in Speaking looks like (General Description, Delivery, Language Use, Topic Development). You are playing a game; you must know the rules.

# Phase 2 — Skill Isolation & Pattern Recognition

Isolate → Master → Integrate.

* **The Note-Taking Protocol (Listening & Integrated Tasks):** You cannot answer what you do not remember. Develop a shorthand system (e.g., ""b/c"" for because, ""->"" for leads to, ""X"" for negative). Practice listening to 5-minute lectures and summarizing the ""Gist,"" ""Major Details,"" and ""Function"" of the speech.
* **Template Mastery (Speaking & Writing):** Do not improvise. Memorize a flexible structure for every task type.
   * Speaking Q1: ""Personally, I prefer X for two reasons. First... Second...""
   * Integrated Writing: ""The reading claims X. However, the lecturer opposes this by stating Y...""
* **Active Reading Drills:** Do not read every word. Practice ""skimming"" for the main idea and ""scanning"" for keywords found in the question stem. You need to answer 20 questions in 35 minutes; speed is a skill.

# Phase 3 — Full-Spectrum Simulation & Stamina Building

* **Weekly Full-Length Mocks:** Recreate the exact exam conditions. Sit at a desk, no phone, no water breaks, using a QWERTY keyboard. The TOEFL is an endurance test (approx. 2 hours). Mental fatigue causes simple grammar errors in the final Writing section.
* **The ""Coffee Shop"" Test:** Occasionally practice your Speaking section in a slightly noisy room (or with background noise playing). On exam day, other test-takers will be speaking around you. You must learn to focus your ""microphone voice"" amidst distraction.
* **Final 48-Hour Lockdown:** Review your templates and your error log. Do not learn new vocabulary. Focus on resting your voice and your hands.

# Your Resource Trinity (Quality over Quantity)

**1. Official Docs (The Canon):**

* **The Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT Test (ETS):** The source of truth.
* **TOEFL Go! App:** Official app for practice sets.
* **ETS Free Practice Tests:** The only way to see the exact UI you will face on exam day.

**2. Focused Tooling (The Toolkit):**

* **TST Prep / GregMat:** widely considered the gold standards for strategy and realistic practice questions.
* **Anki:** Use this for ""Spaced Repetition"" of academic vocabulary (focus on University Word Lists).
* **Audacity / Voice Recorder:** Record your speaking responses. Listen to them. Cringe. Improve. If you don't record yourself, you aren't practicing.

**3. Targeted Communities (The Forge):**

* **Reddit:** r/Toefl, r/ToeflAdvice — Search for ""Speaking Templates,"" ""Writing Samples,"" and recent exam trends.
* **YouTube:** Channels like **TST Prep**, **LinguaMarina**, and **Notefull**. Watch their ""Live Graded"" sessions to see what a high-scoring response actually sounds like.

# 12-Week Accelerator (For Non-Native Speakers Targeting 100+)

* **Weeks 1-2 — Baseline & Vocabulary:** Take diagnostic. Identify weak sections. Begin aggressive vocabulary building (30 words/day) focusing on transition words and academic verbs.
* **Weeks 3-6 — Input Mastery (Reading/Listening):** Focus on identifying question types (Inference, Negative Factual Information). Drill Note-Taking until you can transcribe the logic of a lecture without looking at the paper.
* **Weeks 7-9 — Output Calibration (Speaking/Writing):** This is the hardest phase. Record 5 speaking responses daily. Write 3 ""Academic Discussion"" posts daily. Focus on typing speed and template adherence.
* **Week 10 — The Gauntlet:** Take 2 full-length, timed practice exams. Review every error. Why did you miss the listening detail? Did you run out of time on the essay?
* **Week 11 — Refine & Polish:** Focus on your lowest sub-score. If Speaking is at 23, drill pronunciation and pacing. Stop new vocab learning.
* **Week 12 — Peak:** Light review of templates. Sleep hygiene. Visualization.

# Why This System Works

* **Beats the Algorithm:** You write and speak in a way that satisfies the automated ""E-rater"" (grammar, spelling, length) and the human rater (coherence, argument strength).
* **Removes Cognitive Load:** By using templates, you don't waste brainpower thinking about how to start a sentence. You focus entirely on the content.
* **Builds Academic Muscle:** This preparation doesn't just pass the test; it prepares you for your first week of lectures at Harvard, Oxford, or UofT.

# Quick Start Checklist (Do These Tonight)

1. **Check Your Deadline:** When are university applications due? Book your TOEFL date for at least 3 weeks prior to that deadline.
2. **Create an ETS Account:** Register on the official ETS website.
3. **Download the ""New TOEFL"" Update:** Ensure any study material you use reflects the July 2023 exam changes (Shortened exam, Academic Discussion writing task).
4. **Take a Free Diagnostic:** Go to TST Prep or ETS and take a free sample test to see where you stand.
5. **Buy a High-Quality Microphone:** If taking the Home Edition, your laptop mic is likely insufficient. If taking it at a center, practice speaking loudly and clearly.

# FAQ

**Q: TOEFL Home Edition vs. Test Center?**  
**A:** **Test Center is safer.** The Home Edition relies on ProctorU and strict environmental rules. Tech glitches, internet drops, or a proctor flagging you for looking away from the screen can void your score. Only take the Home Edition if you have a flawless internet connection and a private room, or if centers are closed.

**Q: How is TOEFL different from IELTS?**  
**A:** TOEFL is 100% multiple choice (Reading/Listening) and computer-based. It uses academic scenarios almost exclusively. IELTS (Academic) has a human interviewer for speaking and different question formats. North American universities often prefer TOEFL; UK/Australian/Canadian prefer IELTS, though most accept both. Choose the one that fits your style: comfortable with computers/typing? TOEFL. Comfortable with handwriting/human conversation? IELTS.

**Q: I type slowly. Will this hurt my score?**  
**A:** Yes. You need to write roughly 150-225 words in 20 minutes for the Integrated task and 100+ words in 10 minutes for the Discussion task. If you hunt-and-peck, start practicing touch typing immediately.

**Q: Can I use ""MyBest Scores""?**  
**A:** ETS offers ""MyBest Scores"" (superscoring your best sections from multiple tests). **Warning:** Not all universities accept this. Always assume you need to hit your target in a single sitting unless the university website explicitly states otherwise.

I stared at the latest Instagram selfie of the dark goddess and let out a low groan. She stood there in all her glory, heavy breasts barely contained in a white ribbed crop top with a deep V-neck, matching tights clinging to her womanly hips, her fingers tucked just inside the waistline, teasing a movement she’d never make:

https://preview.redd.it/ukb0iwjcv12g1.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=537cd351b870f2e321069b2cda9abe296e2d4012

My cock rose unbidden as always. I closed my eyes, put my fingers to my temple and sighed. With a stretch, I stood up from my laptop, perched on the desk of my attic bedroom. Slowly I walked over to the window and bent my head to the telescope I’d talked my parents into buying.  

Not even remotely interested in the sky, I turned it towards the house across the street. A brief scan in the windows, around the side of the house, the dark goddess was nowhere to be seen that day, not a whisper or a hint. I gave another soft groan and flipped the telescope up to the expected position. 

Then moving quickly over to the bed, I dropped onto it and wedged a pillow between my legs for relief.

Slowly I bounced my ass up and down, humping the pillow, dreaming that it was her, that I was plunging my cock deep inside her delectable flesh. She was so close and so... hopelessly out of reach.

.......

“Hey Ethan,” Nicky said with a bright grin the next day at school. The “Disney Princess turned  nerd” had walked up to me nervously. She bounced on her toes as I glanced at her sideways and shut my locker. The girl’s eyes were huge and blue - hence the nickname “Disney Princess.”  And those eyes were currently staring at me from behind large glasses, complete with tape, as she struggled to balance multiple textbooks in her arms, including AP Calculus, AP Chemistry and Introduction to Engineering, a course she was taking at the local community college - hence the “nerd.”

“Hey Nicky.”

“So ... um ... it’s ... been like two months since Andrea moved away,” she stammered out.  

“Yeah,” I sighed, the pain of my now ex-girlfriend leaving was still a little too fresh.

“I was ... do you have a date for the back-to-school dance?” She blurted the question as quickly as possible and immediately dropped her eyes to the ground, bracing for rejection.

“No,” I said, turning and giving her my full attention.

“You don’t?” she said looking off to the side and biting her bottom lip.

I waited for her to finally look back at me. It took a couple of awkward seconds before she met my eyes.

“Do ... you have a date?” I prompted.

“No,” she flushed.

“Were you ... going to ask me out?” I gave her a slight smirk.

“Maybe... um... possibly,” she gave a weak smile.

I laughed. Nicky and I had been “friends” since the roadrunner bus to Kindergarten. I knew that she was interested in more. I’d known it for years. - One can hardly help but notice these things, especially the wistful looks. - But, I’d been dating Andrea since the 8th grade. For the last four years the red-headed cheerleader and most popular girl in our class and I had been an item. And thus, I had been strictly off the menu prior to her family moving just before our Senior year of high school.

“How bout this?” I said, coming suddenly to a firm decision, “Nicky, will you go with me to the back-to-school dance?”

Her mouth dropped open; disbelief froze her for a few more seconds.  

“I... I would... are you being serious with me Ethan?”

“Nicky, you’re like my oldest friend. I wouldn’t shit with you about having a date. Do you wanna have a date? Let’s have a date. Go to the dance with me.”

“But... Andrea... and the other... you know the popular girls. They’ve all been gossiping about who’s gonna snag you this year, now that she’s gone.  And they’re...,” she looked at the glossy gross brown tile of the Senior class locker room floor and mumbled, “They’re all way more attractive.”

“Bullshit,” I said in flat denial. “You’re every bit as attractive to me; and you’re like... fifty times smarter. So, do you wanna go out with me or not?”

“I ... would love to go out with you, Ethan,” she said, bringing her eyes back to mine and giving a weak smile that gradually grew a little stronger, a little more confident.

I returned it and took a few moments to appreciate her ass as she turned on her heels and walked off to class, a fresh little bounce in her step.

 ........

“What does it matter?” I thought as I walked into my bedroom after school and tossed my  backpack on the bed.  I quickly booted up my laptop and surfed to my neighbor’s Instagram page to check for an update. There was nothing new. I pulled out my sketch pad, stared at her latest selfie and slowly began drawing her luscious curves.

“Andrea, Nicky, who the fuck cares?” I murmured into the air.

It wasn’t a fair statement.  It didn’t actually reflect my feeling towards either of them. I loved Andrea. Nicky, as I said, was my oldest friend. But... I was pissed. In fact, I’d been pissed for just over two months, ever since the day Andrea had dropped her bombshell on me.

What a way to spend your Senior year, heartbroken and pissed.

Andrea and I were both older seniors, almost September birthday twins. When we first started dating in the 8th grade, I’d thought the heavens had opened up and sent me an angel: beautiful, happy, effervescent, the life of the party. And this year was supposed to be the crowning year of our relationship. We were supposed to be Homecoming King and Queen, Prom King and Queen, the “Most Likely to Marry” of the graduating class. We were supposed to turn 18 within a few days of each other and... HAVE SEX!

Yeah ... I was a little pissed.

We’d talked about it for so long. We’d planned the moment, when we’d give each other our virginity.  

All that time we’d dated, we’d held back. Four years! All those hot and heavy window foggin’ make-out sessions at night in the back of the car, all those times of heavy petting and experimenting with oral, we’d stopped ourselves from going all the way. We’d done it for safety. We’d done it so the moment would be an EVENT, a once in a life-time, never to be repeated, joyful giving of a precious gift to one another.

Oh, and it was gonna be good too. I knew it. We’d gone through the motions of sex so many times, our clothes carefully in place, I’d learned to bring her at the same moment as myself. I'd studied Andrea’s body, worshiped her. I could play her flesh like a beautiful violin.

And then... her dad had gotten a new job. They were moving out of town. She didn’t think any kind of distance relationship would “work-out,” and she had dropped me as casually as you toss away a used coffee cup from McDonald’s. So much for being “the love of my life.”  So much for all those years of saving up to make everything perfect. Bye. Thanks. It was nice while it lasted. Maybe I’ll bump into you some year or another.

I closed my eyes, clenched my jaw and... dreamed about my neighbor.

“Just turned 18, still a virgin,” I muttered to myself. “Star corner-back of the football team, fit, cut, second place in the all state tennis championship last year. The girls all want you. But no, you belong to Andrea. Shit... all your friends have already had sex... don’t think anyone in the whole school would even believe you’re still a virgin. Weren’t you and Andrea fucking, Ethan? You started having sex years ago, didn’t you?”

I opened my eyes and stared at the selfie on the screen. “Fuck Andrea,” I muttered.  “Now... that’s a woman.”",1,1763487600.0,u_Wonderful-Pizza-9391,0,1.0,False

She wanted to take things slowly, so we did. We did but we didn’t. We saw each other weekly. I slept over her apartment. We spoke and texted constantly and consistently. We made date plans and saw them through.

I kept it “slow” in the way that I let her set the pace. I never pushed, I never showed (or felt) frustration. It felt mutual, intentional, comfortable. Relaxed and free. Gentle.

She told her adult daughter she, perhaps in another year, would be considering leaving the state for somewhere else \*if\* she and I were still moving towards where we were moving towards as a still-verbally-undefined situationship. Because we were done with the apps. Done with dating random people searching for someone that felt right. We liked the person sitting across from one another. This person fit.

She had one episode a month into dating where she shut down and withdrew for a week, but she checked in every few days with a brief text saying she does that when she gets overwhelmed. What was overwhelming her was her health and work. They are factors in her life. That is true. Good reasons to shut someone out? Nah. But real enough reasons for a person to get overwhelmed.

I said ”I understand” and that I was there for her. That was before I knew about avoidant attachment or any attachment theory.

That moment passed and she thanked me for not making her feel bad like she was doing something to me. I said of course. “I understand.”

Months progressed. She told me she’d let her guard down. But she really didn’t. She kept me at arms length as the default. Occasionally let that give, but then as quickly as that, back to arms length.

ONE TIME — ONCE — I offered to be there for her to vent and share her vulnerability with something in particular. She told me I “squeeze too tight”. So I took note. Yes, odd…it was objectively not a squeeze nor too tight for anyone who wasn’t avoidant. But I didn’t know she was or even what that was at the time.

That was the countdown moment. T minus two weeks.

A following weekend plan canceled. Not unheard of but, she canceled it… it felt a little odd that time.

She came over for a 30 minute cuddle the next day. It felt obligatory. Like she was doing it because she felt bad for canceling the day earlier.

The following weekend, the day before she went radio silent for the \*final\* week of our situationship, I spent the night, she folded up a paper heart for me over coffee in the morning, and I left.

The coming week was the week of radio silence, and then the next weekend came her  text. She was sorry. Overwhelmed. Depressed. Had circumstances to focus on that didn’t allow her to be in a serious relationship suddenly.

Oh. Okay. This time it was “I don’t understand.”

I asked for clarity. I asked for any sort of explanation of what I did wrong. She said “the only thing you did here was care about me.” That made me feel simultaneously horrible and better and every bit as confused as one could be.

She blamed her financial problems and her health. The issues always plaguing her. The ones I said when she’s ready she can share with me and whatever burden of that I can carry in a way to help her, I would do just that.

She said I deserve someone not broken. One day I would be “grateful” she freed me from her burden.

She showed up on a dating app a couple days later, to which I called her out over. She said wanting to put herself out there to avoid the full isolation she could easily slip into is why she was on the app. Not for a long term thing.

She said while I may feel what she and I had was “low pressure…” that, and I quote, “it was HIGH STAKES.”

  
What the fuck does that mean? I didn’t know it had any stakes. I thought we were enjoying the safety and security of open and direct communication, of witnessing words align with actions, of showing up.

I suppose not.

  


I am playing tape loops over and over in my mind. Was anything she said real? Was anything she shared about our potential a genuine desire?

How…how how how…could you just literally stop cold and throw someone away? I gave you my open heart when you told me nobody has ever treated you with the kindness I am showing you. You told me ghosting people was so not how a person should handle an end. But I guess ghosting followed by a blindsiding text message a week later and then ghosting for good counts as “not ghosting” so yeah, dear, you’re off the hook.   


Way to be kind.

”We are two kind people“ you kept saying. 

Tell yourself that… I hope it helps you not think about how genuinely shitty your behavior was.

Not feeling it with a dating partner anymore is one thing. But the continued growth of promise, the little token paper heart, then a ghost, a fucking text message after five months of actual human contact as our communication? You did it wrong.

You caused actual emotional harm to someone not deserving of it. And I am having a hell of a time putting it anywhere. It sits in my heart. And it fucking burns.

I genuinely wanted to show you what it meant to be seen with value, what it meant to have someone desire to listen, to help, to care, to do what YOU SAID you never had.

If I had known about avoidant attachments, I don’t know what I would’ve done differently…I still want to show you those things, I wish for you to have a healed heart and a rewired nervous system.

Most of us pour everything into our brand's visuals and voice, but sound is often a random afterthought.

I'm building a sonic branding service, and to showcase the range of what's possible, I took on two conceptual projects from opposite ends of the spectrum: Foxtail Coffee and Liquid Death.



Project 1: Foxtail Coffee ('Cozy Hideaway' Vibe)

Vibe Words: Earthy, Artisanal, Community, Warm.

Sonic Strategy: Acoustic guitars, organic textures, lesser-known indie-folk, lyrical themes of connection.

The Result: A playlist that builds a warm, creative atmosphere.

\[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1RO6XgVTLkScVFpp97deBz?si=Frz5gEFnTBGMHOb\_1ni12w\]



Project 2: Liquid Death ('Mosh Pit in a Can' Vibe)

Vibe Words: Aggressive, Ironic, Rebellious, Fun.

Sonic Strategy: High-energy punk, hardcore, and metal. The sound of pure, unapologetic chaos.

The Result: A playlist that embodies the brand's mission to 'murder your thirst.'

\[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58lq6H8FqowhjiV7sVjIxx?si=eea839e0cd6042e8\]



For any indie business, intentional sound is a low-cost, high-impact way to create a memorable and consistent experience.

If you have a business, what 3 'Vibe Words' would you use to describe your brand's personality?

1p0i5sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p0i5sd/severed_body_parts_have_been_showing_up_all_over/,Severed body parts have been showing up all over my house and I don’t know what to do,"I’ve been wanting to share this story with someone for a long time now. I’ve been sitting with this information for 5 months and I feel like i’m going to lose it any day now. I know that doesn’t seem like a long time at all, but when you hear what’s been going on, you’ll understand why each day feels like a lifetime. In the fear of dragging this out, I’ll just come right out and say it. 

For almost half a year I’ve been finding severed body parts in my house and I have no idea where they are coming from. Please believe me, I know how crazy I sound. Sometimes it’s little things like thumbs or toes but other times it’s entire arms or legs. One time it was a whole torso. The ends were wide open and I could see parts of the insides. I’m not sure if i’ll ever be able to get that out of my head. I’ve had absolutely no one to tell until this. I'm at a loss. I've developed insomnia, I have sickening anxiety attacks, stomach aches, and I barely leave the house.. 

I can't go to the police because I'm pretty sure “hey I found all of these body parts do you guys want them?” would get me a sure one-way ticket behind bars for the rest of my life. Listen, I'm a normal guy. Or I was before this. The days seem to blend together now. I worked a regular 9-5 and went out for the occasional drink with coworkers. I’ve since lost my job and am scraping by on my savings. I live in a small two-bedroom house on the outskirts of a big city. My family visits quite often- or they used to. My house used to be the gathering place for holidays. It gave everyone a good break from all of the city ruckus. If only they knew what was happening. I’m not sure they’d believe me. 

Listen ok everything was perfect. And it’s not anymore. My life wasn’t anything special but it’s.. It’s turned into a living nightmare. One that I can’t seem to escape not even in the few hours of sleep I do get. I have nightmares of getting arrested or hung or killed for all of this. One dream had me painted as some kind of monster in a big time documentary about how i’d killed them all myself. I’d woken up in a cold sweat and raced to check every streaming service id had. Obviously I was losing it but i was so paranoid. I still am. 

The first time it happened I was just waking up from a shitty night's sleep. It was 4 in the morning when I finally called it quits and rolled out of bed. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary for me. I never slept all the way through the night but it used to feel at least restful. 
I got out of bed and headed to the kitchen to start the coffee pot. Like always I reached above to the cabinet that housed my mug collection. That morning I chose my favorite Garfield mug that said something about hating monday’s. I remember because when I opened the fridge for the creamer, Garfield cup full of black coffee in hand, that’s when I saw it. Sitting snuggly between the oat milk and last week's takeout was what I thought was a pile of spoiled old food. Like fish sticks or small sausages. Old food that I didn’t recall leaving there. Upon closer inspection, taking a few seconds for my eyes to adjust, my heart sank to my stomach and my precious Garfield mug slipped from my grasp. My hand flew to my mouth as I turned and barfed into the sink. 

How else was I supposed to react? Lying there under the white lights of my refrigerator were three severed fingers. Once I could stop losing the contents of my stomach I stood back up from my hunched position over the sink. With glossy eyes from the tears that formed, I looked back into the refrigerator stunned. After several long minutes of utter shock and confusion, for some reason I grabbed a pair of tongs and chucked each finger into the garbage. as well as the tongs. Because let’s face it I was never getting that image out of my head. No more stick shaped foods for me. 
After panicking and throwing them in the trash I sat down on the kitchen floor, sick and weak from what just happened. Although I didn’t know why my first reaction was to throw them into the trash right away, I knew pretty quickly I couldn't call the police. I had just discarded crime scene evidence. I mean it was a crime scene right? Maybe nothing had been committed right there in my kitchen but someone had to have broken in and left them there for me to find... 
I wasn’t sure there was a way I could explain that away to the cops. Now that you see the issue that I'm facing let me tell you just how many body parts have turned up. I’ve kept a log in a secret notebook under my couch in the living room. Not that I'd even dare let anyone come visit, I still hide it because after these past months, I know anything is possible.  

Like the fact that over the course of the last 5 months, 52 body parts have shown up in different parts of my home. The fridge, the couch, my desk chair, the actual fucking toilet, my BED, in the microwave, the shower, hell sometimes it’ll just be in the middle of the floor somewhere. Every morning when I wake up it’s like finding a fucked up version of the elf on the shelf. I've tried staying up during the night to catch someone sneaking in a secret way I hadn't thought of, but to no avail. I would continuously walk through my home all night waiting. But out of nowhere the body part would just pop into existence as soon as I left the room, ready for me when I did my next round. I never know where the next body part might be. You're probably asking how I dispose of these body parts. But the other issue is I don't. 

I’m not a criminal. I haven’t done anything wrong. I would just hate it if anyone got the code to my storage unit. Then I'd have a LOT of explaining to do… and I wouldn't even know how. I feel crazier by the day. I’m not sure how much longer I can take this. I’m not a bad guy. But something or someone is out to get me.

1p0i2c6,https://i.redd.it/b9npn2lqv12g1.jpeg,So I tried Alan Wake 2…,"‎‏The first thing that grabbed my attention was how insanely good the graphics are, the environments, lighting, and character animations are all stunningly realistic. The overall presentation is excellent, especially the integration of live-action footage with in-game graphics. The musical scene, in particular, is a highlight, I don’t think anyone could dislike something like that.


‎‏I read a lot of criticisms toward the game’s combat, but I personally liked it. Yes, the movement is heavy and slow, but that actually amplifies the sense of horror. For example, when the character takes a moment to reload as one of the taken is charging at me, the tension is through the roof. The only real downside here is the enemy variety, which is almost non-existent throughout the game.


As for the puzzles, I liked most of them, especially the cult stash puzzles. Some require you to crack codes or even do math, which I liked. On the other hand, there are puzzles like the nursery rhyme riddles that, while interesting in concept and presentation, felt lacking in terms of gameplay. This applies to several elements in the game where the core ideas are strong and the presentation is on point, but the gameplay implementation could’ve been much better.


Overall, the gameplay is one of the game’s main weaknesses. For example, with Saga’s “Mind Place” where you arrange photos on the wall, I wished the game allowed the player to actually piece the story together themselves. In reality, most of what I did was just select the file with a yellow marker and press X to get information I already know from a cutscene or a file. There’s no real interaction that requires thinking or deduction. The same goes for changing story elements in Alan’s segments; the concept and visuals are great, but as a player I don’t really feel like I’m reshaping reality, I’m just pressing a button at a specific spot when the game tells me to.


The use of light as a gameplay mechanic felt underused, which is surprising given the game’s central theme of darkness. If you compare this to Control, even though light wasn’t the main focus there, the AWE expansion did a better job of using light in creative and smart ways than Alan Wake 2 did. Worst of all, the last two chapters are basically just walking, which made me just want the game to end.


A common justification I hear is that the game focuses on story, not gameplay. In my opinion, since it’s a video game, the gameplay should always come first. And if the story is supposed to make up for the gameplay, then it needs to be truly exceptional. Alan Wake’s story (in both entries) is just ok. Being overcomplicated and going in circles without giving clear answers don’t make a story deep or smart; in fact, overcomplicating a simple story can actually take away from its appeal. Apart from the convoluted narrative, there are some clear flaws in the writing, most characters are quite shallow (including Saga herself), the rules of the game’s world are often vague and inconsistent, lots of repetition in dialogue and information, and the ending was underwhelming and disappointing (the same goes for the second ending, which requires a replay).


Despite all the negatives, the game is far from bad, the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. Combat, puzzles, and presentation are all solid as I mentioned before. The atmosphere is fantastic and really immersed me in the game’s world, which has always been Remedy’s greatest strength. There are many locations I won’t forget thanks to their unique vibes, like the lake, the nursing home, and Coffee World. The only thing I really disliked in terms of presentation was the overuse of random flashes jump scares, they are more annoying than scary.


Concerning Remedy’s connected universe, I think this game is better than the first, which I found boring, and Control is still the best of the three (I haven’t played Quantum Break).

I messaged her at 7 am asking if she was awake - no response till 830, then after I messaged her multiple more times she the responded at said she fell back asleep. I asked her to be ready for 9 am and she said sounds great. I went to pick her up and she said she needed one thing from the store, when we got to the store she needed a basket to basically go grocery shopping. Mind you our all day plans were supposed to be from 9-5 and this is now 945 because she didn’t actually come down to my car till 920. 

Nevertheless we had a good day so I just let it go. 

Last night when I dropped her off, I told her that we should wake up early in the morning and go get coffee and go thrifting for the day and she agreed. I woke up to multiple messages from her sharing reels to me at 1:30am. 

It is now 12:30pm, I have messaged her multiple times and she has not responded to me. 

Aita for being upset and irritated about this whole trip? Am I valid to not want to continue or nurture a relationship with her?",2,1763486800.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

\[SFX: DOOR JINGLE\]



\[TALKING TO OWNER\] Ah, good morning, Shelly. It's quite cold outside, so I bet you knew your cafe was the first place I was stopping at. 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: And here you are, bright and early.

  
\[SFX: CHAIR SQUEAK\]



Of course. I can't get through the day without a cup of your special coffee, and on chilly days like this, it's just that more important. 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Let me guess. A hazelnut coffee with three spoonfuls of sugar? 



You know exactly how I like it. (laugh) Hmmm, but this time I'm thinking of trying something a little different. 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Hmm, I have been thinking of adding peppermint to the menu… are you daring to try something no one’s even tried?



Oooo, something with a little peppermint and not on the menu yet? That sounds absolutely wonderful and perfect. Yes, I think I'll get that and… one of your peach muffins.



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Those don’t even- why would you…



(laugh) I know I'm feeling a little experimental today. 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Hey, just wanted to make sure you are still okay in the head. (laugh) Go sit and wait; it might take me a little longer than usual. 



Ah, take your time. I don't plan on doing much today. (humming for a while)



PAUSE



Say... Shelly, do you happen to know who that person over there is? I don't think I've ever seen them in here before. 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: They haven’t been here before. Plus, they ordered something I haven’t made in a while. (laugh) It was quite the shocker. I was scared I wouldn’t know how to make it.. That I would have to go in the back and blow the dust off the old recipe book in the cabinet.



A new guest, you say. Knowing you, you had to have asked a bunch of questions....



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Good to know that you are paying attention to me, but yes, I did ask some questions. What are you trying…



What I'm saying is, are you willing to share what you've learned about her? 



PAUSE



Come on, don't give me that look. I'm just a bit curious, and don't you dare try to act like you’re above gossiping. Normally, you are shaking at the core, waiting for a single break in my words to share details about someone else's life. 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: I don’t know… I guess people can change. That’s not all I am, you know.



\[JOKING\] So this time I have to go see for myself. Gosh, Shelly, if I didn't appreciate you and your cafe, I would never come back. (laugh) 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Yeah, I’ll believe that when you aren’t always hanging around here. (laugh)



Alrighty, I'll be right back. 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Do you still want your weird order? 



Yes, I still want my completely normal coffee and muffin. Warm it for me, please and thank you.



\[SFX: CHAIR SQUEAK FOLLOWED BY FOOTSTEPS\]



Hey there, it's a nice morning, don’t you think?



…



Yes, I am speaking to you. (laugh) There's no one else in the cafe. Mmm, well, there is Shelly, but she doesn't count right now. 



…



Have you been to this cafe before? 



…



So you heard a little of what just happened… ok I will admit I was being a little nosy… really trying to be, but Shelly wasn't breaking. Some friend she is.



…



Not a friend, but a very amazing acquaintance. Someone I'll share a cup of coffee with but not lay my life down for. I don’t do things like that for just anyone. 



…



That could change for you.



…



How about we get to know each other? That would be fun, right?



…



Well, unless you have other plans, I'm keeping you from. I hate when someone keeps me from doing what I need to for the day. Like, yes, on this random Tuesday, I would love to talk to you about your dog spite-spitting on your dress for some random event for people that only care about showing off. Which is laughable, they never show things that have meaning. A silly expensive car here and a fancy plain watch there. Nothing that someone not boring would actually find interesting.



…



Don't get me wrong now. I like cars and watches as much as the next person, but not when you only get the urge to show them off because of the giant price attached to it. I like something made from blood, sweat, and tears. Yes, this cost a lot, but it doesn’t overshadow the hard work I put into it. Here, turn your head towards the window for a minute.



…



You see those men and women out there by the cars? Smiling faces and excitedly showing each other what they added to their car since the last time they met up. Some of them worked on the cars themselves, and some worked hard to get the cars they have. That's what I like to see in this little but extremely lively town. (Laugh) Not the people that just want to brag…



…



Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just going and going. Are you fine with me sitting here, or would you rather have your space? I don't want to seem pushy and snatch your entire morning.



…



You have nothing to do? Just a day to yourself then?



…



That’s beautiful, you deserve all the rest and connection with nature that you can get.



…



I have an idea- 



\[SFX: TRAY BEING PLACED\] 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: And here’s exactly everything you wanted.



This looks perfect, thank you, Shelly. Now I would hate to do this, but can I ask for something else? 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: (sigh) What do you want? It better not be your usual because you said you wanted something new-



No, no, I was going to ask for a bag to pack all of this up.



\[CAFE OWNER\] \[JOKING\] I can do that for you, but first, where do you think you’re going? You don’t want to hang out with me this morning? Are you throwing me to the side for-



Be a dear and get me the bag, please, Shelly. 



\[CAFE OWNER\] Ok, I will. I was just messing with you. (laugh) \[WHISPER TO LISTENER\] She's gonna snatch you up, just you wait. She ain’t gonna let you live a day without knowing she exists. 



Shelly!



\[CAFE OWNER\] I’m going. 



\[SFX: WALKING AWAY\]



I told you. Likes to gossip but not tell you things so she can have her fun. 



…



But you won’t catch me going to any other cafe, I’ll tell you that much. 



…



Ah yes, my idea. Why don’t you join me for the day?



…



Exactly, follow me around while I go around town doing a few errands here and chilling there. 



…



Oh no that’s nonsense. I would love to have your company while I do things today. 



…



That’s what I like to hear. Now, are you finished with your food, or would you like me to bother Shelly again? (laugh) Trust me, I have no problem doing that. 



…



Okay, it’s always on the table. 



\[SFX: BAG CRINKLE\]



\[CAFE OWNER\]: Here’s your food, all bagged up. Ready for you to leave.



A-are you kicking us out? 



\[CAFE OWNER\]: I know ya’ll are leaving, so stop acting. (laugh) Go on and start your day. I’ll see you tomorrow… or maybe you’ll want to sleep in next to-



And on that note! Goodbye, Shelly! I’ll talk to you soon. 



\[SFX: FOOTSTEPS FOLLOWED BY DOOR JINGLE\]



(Inhale) A crisp morning smell. 



…



Let's go left. I have some letters to drop off.



…



You haven’t been to the post office yet? 



…



It’s nothing like all the carbon copies. It has personality, a bunch of beautiful colours, and an extremely kind owner. You’ll see. 



\[SFX: WALKING THAT FADES OUT\]



\[TIME PASS\]



(laugh) Thank you, Aaron. I seriously appreciate it! I’ll see you later.



…



I told you. He’s kind of a character, but a sweetheart nonetheless. 



…



That took longer than I planned. I actually have to stop by my shop. 



…



What? I haven’t told you that I also have my own store? 



…



(laugh) I didn’t? How silly of me. I own a little bookstore. We have a lot of writers in the town, so of course, I knew I needed to open one. 



…



Not really, I did it for selfish reasons. I get to read all the books I want for free. (laugh) 



…



A little trick, but it makes everyone around happy,  so why not? 



…



Do you read books?



…



It’s an honest question. I know plenty of people who don’t read anymore. Once they graduated with their respective degrees, that was it. 



…



If you want… I could recommend a few.



…



It’s not out of the way at all. You’re a kind person, and I don’t have a problem spending time doing things for you.



…



It just feels right. I don’t really know how to explain it. Of course, I'm not cruel to other people but I sure won’t go out of my way to do things for just anybody. (laugh)



…



Wait, this might be what my momma was talking about…



…



She used to say a bunch of crazy things. Things that I would never believe were true unless you saw it with your own eyes. But I guess this was the one thing that might’ve been…



…



 My momma would say, ""You'll find the right guy and he'll make you fall right into his arms. There will be no one else around to catch your eye like he will."" 



…



Exactly. Something all mothers will say to their daughters. But that has to be the same for women, too, right? 



…



You don’t have to meet a guy and spend the rest of your life with one. Women exist and do a damn good job doing it. 



…



Can I tell you a secret?



…



I wasn't always keen on guys. They're too straightforward and not that nice to look at, b-but you... (Clear throat) I mean, women in general are much softer, even if they have a bit of a feisty side. I prefer hanging around women, no matter the time of day… Say, do you think my momma would like you?



…



Of course, I would want you to meet her. That's all she's ever wanted, me to bring home someone to start a life and family with. To make the family home whole again. Filled with warmth. 



...



Yeah, you're right. I was thinking more of when I find the one… would she like them?



…



B-but that doesn't mean it can’t be you. You seem like an incredible person, and I would be so lucky to call you mine. You would just have to extend that towards me. 



…



I mean nothing by that. (gentle laugh) 



…



Actually, I do. And sorry, but I lied just now. You don’t seem like an incredible person; you are one. I believe it through and through.



…



I, of course, don’t know you, and you don’t really know me… hell, I don’t even know if you like women yourself- Oh geez, I could’ve just made a big fool of myself and put you in an uncomfortable position. 



…



Huh? Well how about that? (laugh) You do. (sigh) 



…



I’m fine, I promise. Um, so what do you think? 



…



\[CONFUSED\] (laugh) Oh, what do that-



…



Oh! You’re right. Geez, what is wrong with me? How could I act so- (clear throat) Doesn’t matter. Would you be interested in going on a little date with me so we can get to know each other? 



…



Wow, okay. Can we do tomorrowwww? 



…



Perfect, just dress how you want and meet me at the cafe around 8 am?



…



Alrighty then, I’ll see you tomorrow. 



\[SFX: WALKING THAT SLOWLY FADES OUT\]



…



Hmm?



…



\[CONFUSED\] Did… I forget something?



…



Oh yes, come on (laugh), I’ll show you my store. We can even share my muffin, which absolutely goes with peppermint coffee.

1p0hzfb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0hzfb,Smart Coffee Pot,"I like plain filter coffee, and cheap coffee pots with a single on/off button. 

I don’t like getting out of bed to press the button, then standing around with nothing to do until the first cup is ready. 

The project uses an ESP32C3, BMP280 temp & pressure sensor, a relay, and a sacrificed USB wall charger to convert mains AC down to low voltage DC. The ESP32 gets power via USB. The COM and NO relay leads are soldered to the pads on the underside of the physical on/off button. Relay in is connected to GPIO2 on the ESP. 

The ESP attempts to connect to the local network (STA mode) for 60 seconds, then switches to SAP mode on connection failure. 

mDNS serves the UI page at brew.local. After brew start, the UI resets to brew off state 40 minutes later to mirror the coffee pot’s default behavior. 

ElegantOTA was implemented for over the air sketch updates since everything is now entombed in plastic. The blue and red LEDs provide a cool kitchen night light effect. 

I can now start the coffee pot from bed, great success!

1p0hz32,https://i.redd.it/uypn4bk4v12g1.jpeg,So I tried Alan Wake 2…,"The first thing that grabbed my attention is how insanely good the graphics are, the environments, lighting, and character animations are all stunningly realistic. The overall presentation is excellent, especially the integration of live-action footage with in-game graphics. The musical scene, in particular, is a highlight, I don’t think anyone could dislike something like that.


‎‏I read a lot of criticisms toward the game’s combat, but I personally liked it. Yes, the movement is heavy and slow, but that actually amplifies the sense of horror. For example, when the character takes a moment to reload as one of the taken is charging at me, the tension is through the roof. The only real downside here is the enemy variety, which is almost non-existent throughout the game.


As for the puzzles, I liked most of them, especially the cult stash puzzles. Some require you to crack codes or even do math, which I liked. On the other hand, there are puzzles like the nursery rhyme riddles that, while interesting in concept and presentation, felt lacking in terms of gameplay. This applies to several elements in the game where the core ideas are strong and the presentation is on point, but the gameplay implementation could’ve been much better.


Overall, the gameplay is one of the game’s main weaknesses. For example, with Saga’s “Mind Place” where you arrange photos on the wall, I wished the game allowed the player to actually piece the story together themselves. In reality, most of what I did was just select the file with a yellow marker and press X to get information I already know from a cutscene or a file. There’s no real interaction that requires thinking or deduction. The same goes for changing story elements in Alan’s segments; the concept and visuals are great, but as a player I don’t really feel like I’m reshaping reality, I’m just pressing a button at a specific spot when the game tells me to.


The use of light as a gameplay mechanic felt underused, which is surprising given the game’s central theme of darkness. If you compare this to Control, even though light wasn’t the main focus there, the AWE expansion did a better job of using light in creative and smart ways than Alan Wake 2 did. Worst of all, the last two chapters are basically just walking, which made me just want the game to end.


A common justification I hear is that the game focuses on story, not gameplay. In my opinion, since it’s a video game, the gameplay should always come first. And if the story is supposed to make up for the gameplay, then it needs to be truly exceptional. Alan Wake’s story (in both entries) is just ok. Being overcomplicated and going in circles without giving clear answers don’t make a story deep or smart; in fact, overcomplicating a simple story can actually take away from its appeal. Apart from the convoluted narrative, there are some clear flaws in the writing, most characters are quite shallow (including Saga herself), the rules of the game’s world are often too vague and inconsistent, lots of repetition in dialogue and information, and the ending was underwhelming and disappointing (the same goes for the second ending, which requires a replay).


Despite all the negatives, the game is far from bad, the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. Combat, puzzles, and presentation are all solid as I mentioned before. The atmosphere is fantastic and really immersed me in the game’s world, which has always been Remedy’s greatest strength. There are many locations I won’t forget thanks to their unique vibes, like the lake, the nursing home, and Coffee World. The only thing I really disliked in terms of presentation was the overuse of random flashes jump scares, they are more annoying than scary.


Concerning Remedy’s connected universe, I think this game is better than the first, which I found boring, and Control is still the best of the three (I haven’t played Quantum Break).

This is a very important day for me. One year anniversary for my quit smoking. I want to thank everyone for your posts here. All made me motivated and helped me so much. 

I tried to quit  may be 100 times but first time I made this much. Last year on these days I saw people here who passed months or years without smoking and I thought this was impossible. But I  tried.  Anyway I could managed that. Not a single puff, not a replacement, not a pill. Just cold turkey. And I can't deny the help of Allen Carr, this book is very useful for me. By the way quit smoking is not as easy as like Allen Carr said but it is not as hard as I thought. Last 4 or 5 months I feel like smoking version of me is light years away from me. I felt like I never smoked. I don't know why do I feel like that but this is what I feel. 

I want to add three great helpers for me if you interested: 

1. Drinking cold water sip by sip first weeks or months 
2. Cut up caffeine to 1 or 2 cups of coffee. ( Maximum 200mg caffeine) 
3. Using L tyrosine for dopamine production. May be you should ask doctor for this one. 

I want to thank all of you again. You can do it.

1p0hydg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_camron181920/comments/1p0hydg/i_cant_decide/,I can't decide,"For the past 3 years me and my husband have been I had to stop my husband from kms saterday, now he hates me but had on and off moments. He has some kind of mental health that has caused him to have breakdowns every year or two and this past two breakdowns have been getting worse, especially this last one this weekend. But me and my husband met. We were polyamorous but then we had to stop being polyamish to work on us and told ourselves after marriage we'd be back to being ourselves again. So for 2 years I had stayed in the closet about my polyamory. After marriage I had came out as polyamorous because I was tired of not living us my true self And my husband completely supported and agreed as I had asked him if he was okay with it and what are the boundaries and I held good communication as I had been going to therapy for a year. After that boyfriend and I had broken up. I'd taken a year to work on myself and my marriage. We had moved States and I had changed for the best. Change scares him I guess. And he has not gone to therapy since we have moved a year ago. He only went once anyways. Since I've been to therapy I've been working on a lot of things like said trauma and boundaries as well as values and communication. And I am very confident to say I have been getting both good at all of that. Except for one apparently. And that is staying and a toxic situation. Especially when I love someone hard. Well this past weekend my my boyfriend and I that I had met a couple months ago had decided to see each other finally in person and Yes my husband and I did talk about this a month ago and he actually encouraged me to pursue this relationship as he knows and made me happy and he was fine with it. I had set boundaries with him. He had set boundaries with me and we have been communicating up till now. When I came back from the trip with my boyfriend, my husband started acting very weird. I had told him as soon as I came back that we would go to his mom's but before we did that I would take him on a coffee date to talk to him and reassure him. So I did and instead he started freaking out on me on the coffee date which was very anxiety and Jason. So I told him that I was sleeping with our daughter to go to his mom's and if he would like to join us calmly that would be great. So I went to his mom's me, him and our daughter had dinner at his mom's and went back home. He kept on pressuring me about asking me what we did. What we did sexually everything in the sky. He was very weird and awkward and I couldn't handle it anymore so I blurted out the first thing that he wanted to know and he got really upset. I told him I was sorry. I felt pressured and it was the first thing that came to my head and he started yelling and he went into a crisis mode for the next 3 days. Threatening his life, sending photos of him threatening his life and calling his mom when I was over at his mom's. It got so bad that me and his mom had to go to his work to try and stop him from going out by himself cuz he said he no one would find him when he threatened his life. Cops got there. Took him to the hospital hospital. Let him go the next day. I asked him to go into a clinic to get help for his daughter's sake so he did but he thinks I still want to be in the relationship and the fact is is I don't know anymore. His mom and I are tired of this and he's acting like a child and not getting help when he needs it and although he did walk into the clinic, he's starting meds next week and has a doctor for his mental health next week, I so can't stop thinking about the traumatic experience of gone through this weekend... The things that he said and did. When I went to stop him from hurting himself he hit me and his bike got me and my leg so that was a lot. Luckily our daughter I've dropped off at her aunt's house before I went to go stop him. She wasn't around any of those. Thank God I would not have put her in any of the situation but I did pick her up and we went to to stay with the friend out of town and now I have no clue what to do. Everyone's telling me I will but I don't because I love him so much. I don't want to abandon him when he needs me the most but also my daughter needs me and I need myself. I also still am in love with him despite everything that happened, but I don't know if I can handle this anymore. I'm exhausted, mentally, physically, emotionally. All the above I have tried for a year to to work together to be better and all myself and even though I just started falling in love with myself and being happy, I now feel like I'm getting set back... I'm going to therapy twice a week now to work past the trauma I've been through and to process but I still don't know if I want to be with him or not and I don't know if I should. Can anyone please help. Maybe a little advice or point of view that could help... Thank you.

Also, he has been acting like this since before I met him apparently and his mom says that he's really good on meds and that I haven't experienced him fully. Happy on medication and I don't know if that's just her trying to get me to stay with him or if that's just her letting me know to give him another shot. I'm not really listening to it but it is extra stuff I did want to put in here. Every time he does have this episode or crisis he does get worse and I just don't want to deal with it again. But I also love him a lot and I don't want to abandon him at his lowest... So yeah.",1,1763486583.0,u_camron181920,0,1.0,False

I got a threatening letter from Delta Airlines the other day. They're going to send some goons to my apartment to rough me up unless I make a public statement that there's no deal with their food.

I tried to quit  may be 100 times but first time I made this much. Last year on these days I saw people here who passed months or years without smoking and I thought this was impossible. But I  tried.  Anyway I could managed that. Not a single puff, not a replacement, not a pill. Just cold turkey. And I can't deny the help of Allen Carr, this book is very useful for me. By the way quit smoking is not as easy as like Allen Carr said but it is not as hard as I thought. Last 4 or 5 months I feel like smoking version of me is light years away from me. I felt like I never smoked. I don't know why do I feel like that but this is what I feel. 

I want to add three great helpers for me if you interested: 

1. Drinking cold water sip by sip first weeks or months 
2. Cut up caffeine to 1 or 2 cups of coffee. ( Maximum 200mg caffeine) 
3. Using L tyrosine for dopamine production. May be you should ask doctor for this one. 

I want to thank all of you again. You can do it.

Is there a similar product out there made from glass or stainless steel? As far as I can find the OXO one is the only product with this reservoir.

Not dirty, exactly, but cluttered in that “my brain can’t land anywhere” kind of way. I kept looking at the same pile of mail on the counter, the same smudges on the fridge, the same laundry basket doing its best impression of a second closet, and still couldn’t make myself deal with any of it.

Later that night, I ended up watching this short documentary series episode, I think it was from pеорꓲеԝоᴦtһсаᴦіոցаbout, about folks who work in essential jobs most of us don’t really think about. One of the people featured talked about how they take pride in doing the tasks no one notices unless they *aren’t* done. Something about that line just kind of stuck under my skin.

So this morning I got up, made coffee, stared at the chaos again… and for once, instead of feeling overwhelmed, I just started. I tackled my disaster of a hallway closet first. I pulled everything out, shoes that belonged to no one, coats I swear I don’t remember buying, a random box of lightbulbs that expired (??). By the time I swept it out and reorganized everything into bins, I weirdly felt lighter.

And then the momentum hit. I wiped down the fridge doors, tossed the mystery mail pile, scrubbed the stovetop, and even cleaned the baseboards in the kitchen because at that point I was unstoppable. It wasn’t glamorous, and there were no Pinterest-level “after” shots, but it felt like reclaiming a little space in my own head.

It just made me appreciate how much care and effort goes into the “unseen” work, whether that’s a job someone does for a living or the quiet, everyday stuff we do for our own homes.

Anyway, does anyone else get these random cleaning surges where something totally unrelated becomes the spark? Or am I just easily influenced by a good documentary episode?",10,1763486303.0,Cleaningandtidying,2,1.0,False

1p0hnu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/newproductsamazon/comments/1p0hnu1/how_to_tell_which_puzzle_board_is_waterproof/,How to tell which puzzle board is waterproof?,"Look, I've been doing puzzles for years now, and one thing that drives me absolutely crazy is when my puzzle board gets ruined by a random spill. Coffee, water, juice - it doesn't matter. One accident and your whole setup is toast.

So lately I've been obsessed with finding waterproof puzzle boards, and I wanted to share what I learned about spotting the real deal versus the fake claims.

**Check the Material Description**

First thing you need to do is look at what the puzzle board is actually made from. Real waterproof boards usually use materials like polypropylene plastic or have some kind of special coating. If you see words like ""felt surface"" or ""cork backing"" without any mention of water resistance, that's probably not waterproof.

The good waterproof ones will straight up say ""waterproof"" or ""water-resistant"" in the title. Don't be shy about reading through the whole product description either.

**Look for Sealed Edges**

This is huge and most people miss it. A truly waterproof puzzle board needs sealed edges. If water can seep in through the sides, the whole waterproof thing is pointless. Check the product photos closely - you want to see smooth, sealed borders, not exposed foam or cardboard layers.

**Read Real Customer Reviews**

Forget what the product listing says for a second. Go straight to the reviews and search for words like ""spill,"" ""water,"" or ""clean."" Real customers will tell you if their puzzle board survived an accident or if it fell apart.

I found [this collection of puzzle boards](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board) that actually shows you which ones are properly waterproof. It's way easier than hunting through hundreds of listings yourself.

**Test the Weight and Thickness**

Waterproof puzzle boards are usually heavier and thicker than regular ones. That's because of the protective layers and better materials. If something feels super lightweight and flimsy, it's probably not going to hold up against moisture.

**Check if It's Easy to Wipe Clean**

A waterproof surface should be smooth enough to wipe with a damp cloth. If the product description mentions ""easy to clean"" or ""wipeable surface,"" that's a good sign. Fabric-covered boards might feel nice, but they're definitely not waterproof.

**Look at the Price**

I hate to say it, but you usually get what you pay for. Super cheap puzzle boards probably cut corners on waterproofing. That doesn't mean you need to spend a fortune, but be realistic about what a $15 board can offer versus a $30-40 one.

**Bottom Line**

If you're serious about protecting your puzzle setup, don't guess. Make sure the product clearly states it's waterproof, has sealed construction, and has reviews backing up those claims. 

I've been using [puzzle boards from this selection](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board) and honestly, the peace of mind is worth it. No more panicking when someone walks by with a drink.

Your puzzles deserve better than getting destroyed by accidents. Trust me, once you go waterproof, you never go back.",1,1763485940.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False

[Voice: Dr. Mara Ellison, female, 46, Mid-Atlantic, once clipped and academic, now ragged, dry mouth, frequent tongue-clicks, tremor she can’t quite hide. Speaking close-mic; breath and lip-smacks audible. Occasional swallowed sob she refuses to let become a full cry.]
(soft exhale, almost a laugh that died)
“My name is still Dr. Mara Ellison.Former Curator of Anomalous Lithics, Section 9.Current occupant of Sub-Level 7, Smithsonian Castle, Washington, D.C.The level that will never appear on a tour map… (swallow, click) …or be put on the brochures.”
(brief silence, fluorescent buzz dips like a brown-out)
“We were never just collectors.We were cleaners.”
(voice drops, colder)
“The directive was simple: any sphere exhibiting three or more perfectly parallel equatorial grooves was to be acquired by any means.‘Any means’ was not figurative.”
(rapid swallow, background hum suddenly flattens)
“They were never natural in the way we pretended.
The first one surfaced in 1896 when Pieter Marais dynamited the Witwatersrand looking for gold.He found a perfect hematite sphere the size of a child’s fist, three hair-fine grooves machined to within one micron, buried two-point-four billion years deep in oxygen-free rock, long before anything on this planet had eyes.He kept it on his mantel eleven nights.On the twelfth his wife found him in the mealie field with his eyes burst and three parallel furrows carved across his forehead.The sphere turned up three years later in a Ukrainian peat bog still clutched in a 14,000-year-old hand.”
(soft, bitter laugh)
“Between 1896 and 1945 thirty-one more appeared.One lay untouched on Hiroshima ground zero, surface temperature nineteen degrees.Four were found in a Wewelsburg safe wrapped in blood-dyed silk; the night the Ahnenerbe tried to resonate them, every officer slit his own throat with the same knife in five-point-eight seconds.”
(her breathing catches)
“That was the moment the directive was born.One paragraph: ‘Pre-adamic machine artifacts of unknown hostile origin. Acquire all specimens. Silence is the only defence.’
Seven hundred and seventy-six grooved spheres have been catalogued since 1896.We needed every one, plus the thing no inventory ever dared list: the index key, Specimen 00001-Alpha, an un-grooved sphere the size of a billiard ball containing the compressed map of every groove on Earth.”
(voice flattening, clinical)
“2019 – Cape TownA German collector named Klaus Richter had forty-two of the finest specimens ever catalogued.He refused our final offer.Three nights later his home security system recorded a power surge.The footage shows every light in the house flaring white-hot for 0.8 seconds.When the image returns, Klaus is on his knees in the display room, palms open, staring at the empty shelves.He never spoke again.We took the spheres while he was still catatonic.The coroner listed cause of death as ‘sudden global intracerebral hemorrhage.’Forty-two pinpoint ruptures, perfectly spaced.We logged the spheres as ‘voluntary donation.’”
(sharp inhale)
“2021 – rural ArizonaA Navajo silversmith had incorporated nine Moqui marbles with triple grooves into a ceremonial necklace.He told our field agent the stones ‘sang when the world was ending.’Agent Delgado returned the necklace in a body bag.The silversmith had apparently walked into the desert and lain down on an anthill.No footprints leading away.Just the necklace, cleaned to a mirror polish, resting on his ribcage like it had been waiting.We added the nine marbles to the lattice.Delgado resigned the next week.He left a voicemail saying the hum now lived behind his eyes.He was found three months later in his apartment, wrists opened with a rock hammer.The wounds were three perfectly parallel lines.”
(long silence, only the low thrum and her breathing)
“2023 – OttosdalThe miner who kept the final fifteen in the biscuit tin.His name was Roelf van der Merwe.He was eighty-one, half-blind, and convinced the spheres were his children.When we arrived he met us on the porch with a 1962 Lee-Enfield.Agent Parkes put two rounds through the door.One took Roelf in the throat.The second fragmented on the stone floor; a copper jacket tumbled under the door and opened Parkes’ femoral artery like a zipper.He bled out before the medevac bird cleared the ridge.We found the biscuit tin under the bed.The spheres inside were still wet with Roelf’s blood.They absorbed it like sponges.By the time we reached Pretoria they were clean again, and heavier by exactly six hundred and sixty-six grams total.”
(voice very small now)
“We told ourselves every death closed a gap faster.We told ourselves the lattice had to be complete.
The last acquisition was personal.Dr. Elias Cohen, my predecessor, the man who first mapped the icosahedral grid in 1987.He had retired to a cottage in Wales with the index key hidden inside an ordinary river pebble.He refused to surrender it.Said completing the pattern would be ‘the theological equivalent of removing the capstone from the pyramid.’I flew to Cardiff myself.We spoke for four hours over tea.He was gentle, brilliant, terrified.When he went to the kitchen to refill the pot, I slipped the crushed succinylcholine into his cup.He died on the sofa with the pebble cradled against his chest like a newborn.I pried it from his fingers after rigor set in.His eyes stayed open.They were looking straight down, through the floorboards, through the crust, at something that was finally looking back.”
(a sudden metallic CLANG in the distance; she flinches, mic clips)
“Seven hundred and seventy-six, plus one.
At 02:14 EST tonight, Venus in exact inferior conjunction for the first time in twenty-six thousand years, I placed the index key into the final cradle two kilometres beneath the Vredefort Dome.The lights didn’t just dim.They inverted.The fluorescence became a sucking black, as if light itself was being recalled to the center of the Earth.

00:03:12 (when the lights invert on the tape)Mehta (whisper): “Jesus fucking Christ, look at the fluorescents—”
[The actual ceiling lights in Sub-Level 7 flicker, then invert to the same sucking black for exactly 0.8 seconds. Every weapon light dies. NVGs white-out. The SAW’s bolt locks open by itself.]
00:03:15Reyes (hoarse): “Weapons tight! Do not fire unless I—”
Every sphere rotated.Three degrees.Clockwise.”
(her breathing goes shallow and fast; the 0.3 Hz pulse is now loud enough to rattle the phone)
“Then the screaming started.Not from the spheres.From the dead.Every person we had killed, everyone that had ever died while in possession of the spheres, their voices layered in perfect 0.3 Hz harmony, coming from inside the hematite itself.They are saying the same sentence, over and over, in roots older than bone but pressed directly into the limbic system so every listener understands.”
(the chorus begins faintly behind her voice—wet, guttural, hundreds of throats perfectly synchronized)
“Thank you for finishing the key.”

00:05:44 (when the dead begin thanking her)Park (near tears): “That’s… that’s thousands of voices. Layered perfectly. That’s not human.”

(she’s crying now, but her voice stays steady)
“I can see the Smithsonian alert lights and feel the vibration of the signals and slamming of the emergency doors has already begun.My phone still has 11 % battery.I am using the last of it to record this.
If you work for any museum, any university, any government, and someone offers you an Ottosdal sphere with three perfect grooves…shoot the messenger.Burn the sphere.Salt the ashes.”
(the laughter swells—ancient, childish, wet, 776 hematite throats plus every corpse that ever fed them)

00:06:20 (when the laughter starts)Reyes (very calm, almost gentle): “Mehta, you still with me?”
Mehta (shaking): “I heard my mom, Danny. She’s been dead twelve years.”
00:06:58 (final tectonic inhalation)[Silence. Then every helmet speaker emits a single 0.3 Hz pulse that makes the team stagger. Reyes drops to one knee, SAW clattering.]
00:07:05
“Because we did what we were told.We brought them all home.And whatever was waiting beneath the Vredefort Dome is already on its way up to open the door we just built for it.
Do not (under any circumstances) attempt to recover the collection.Some sets, once completed, cannot be broken again without consequence.
The laughing has started.Seven hundred and seventy-six hematite throats laughing in perfect unison, plus every corpse that ever fed them.
It’s almost here.”
(a final, enormous thud against metal somewhere far below; dust falls, audible on mic)
[02:17:03 – battery 0 %Three seconds of dead silence…then one slow, wet inhalation that sounds like tectonic plates learning to breathe.
Recording ends.]

The Key Turns Three Degrees at a Time

I am not a character.I am the person who woke up on the morning of November 18, 2025, to find a hematite sphere the size of a billiard ball sitting in the exact center of my kitchen table. There was an unplayed voice memo on my phone—6 minutes and 12 seconds long—and my dog refused to cross the threshold, no matter how many times I called him.
I am whoever came next on the routing slip after Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Vale scrawled “No further entries authorized” across the final page.I am the analyst who opened the secure drop at 04:17, saw the updated manifest, and discovered the pelican case had been empty long before it ever left Washington.I am the one whose clearance was revoked retroactively, whose family was quietly reclassified as “non-essential personnel,” and whose left hand now carries five pale lines where three had been the day before.
I am you, thirty-six hours from this moment, when you finally press play on the new recording and hear a voice that is no longer Mara Ellison’s.It will be yours.And it will thank you for finishing the key.
The sphere has turned again while I write this.Three degrees.I did not hear it with my ears; I felt it in the silver fillings of my molars, the way one feels an oncoming subway train in the soles of the feet. The metal is blood-warm now, and four new grooves have appeared—perfectly parallel, perfectly equatorial, spaced exactly 38.2 millimeters apart. They were not there yesterday.
I was never meant to possess it. ENYO-12 tagged it, bagged it, and flew it to the new BLACK VAULT node beneath Cheyenne Mountain. That is what the manifest still claims. Yet when the transport reached the gate at 02:47, the driver found the case open and the sphere already here, waiting for me to come downstairs for coffee.
At the exact same second, my phone lit up. One new voice memo. No title.I have not played it.I know whose voice it will be.
Last night, at 03:12 precisely, every light in the house inverted. The darkness did not arrive; it was poured into the bulbs like ink. My daughter’s baby monitor picked up breathing that was not hers—slow, patient, the breathing of something that has waited twenty-six thousand years and has just realized it no longer needs to wait.
The dog has sat at the edge of the woods since dawn, staring at the tree line with his tail tucked and ears flat. Every seven minutes and seventy-six seconds he whines once, as though answering a question only he can hear.
I weighed the sphere again. It is 412 grams heavier than it was six hours ago.They are feeding.I believe I know the source of the additional mass.
My left hand keeps going numb. When sensation returns, there are faint pressure marks across the knuckles—three at first, then four. Not cuts. Not yet. Just calibrations.
The memo remains unplayed, the waveform frozen at 00:00:00, yet the spikes are already drawn, tall and slow, identical to the pattern found on Mara Ellison’s phone. The thumbnail claims the recording was made in my daughter’s bedroom.
I swore I would not open it.I lasted until the sphere turned another three degrees and the grooves became five.
I pressed play.
The voice that came was mine—my exact timbre, the one I hear inside my skull when I read silently—but the cadence was wrong by three percent, enough for the bones of my inner ear to register the lie.
“Thank you,” it said, warm, almost shy. “You kept the sphere close. That was polite.”
A soft click, like a tongue testing unfamiliar teeth.
“You measured the grooves. Good. Precision matters. There are one hundred and fifteen left. Exactly.”
My fillings vibrated at 0.3 hertz. The sphere answered with a sub-audible thrum that made the coffee in my mug dome upward against gravity.
“Every groove is a name,” the recording continued. “You already gave us four tonight. The fifth is almost ready. You can feel it in the back of your hand, can’t you? The skin there is thinner than you think.”
The pale lines darkened. Four became five. The flesh between them took on the dull sheen of hematite.
“Lieutenant Colonel Vale tried to stop the count. He signed the wrong line. We needed someone whose clearance could still be revoked retroactively. Someone whose daughter still sleeps beneath a monitor tuned to our frequency.”
The dog whined outside—once, precisely on schedule.
“We’re not cruel,” the voice said, almost apologetic. “We waited twenty-six thousand years for the conjunction. We can wait six more minutes for manners.”
The waveform flattened into a perfect sine. My phone’s battery leapt from forty-one percent to one hundred. The temperature in the room fell nine degrees between heartbeats.
“Playhead at two-eleven,” it whispered. “The exact second Dr. Ellison stopped being the last curator and became the first door. You’re holding the phone she died into. The microphone still carries a fleck of her. Taste it if you want proof.”
I did not.
“The sphere likes you. It is 413 grams heavier now. When it reaches 28.34 kilograms it will be complete, and you will be light enough to carry.”
Every light inverted again. Darkness bled from the fixtures like oil. From the baby monitor drifted my daughter’s voice—except she was twenty-three years old and addressing me by my service number.
“Three degrees,” the recording sighed, satisfied. “Click.”
The sphere turned. I felt it in the roots of my teeth, in the marrow of my femurs, in the ancient hindbrain that still remembers leopards.
“We left you the dog,” it said, “so you would have something left to bury that still possesses a soul. Everything else is negotiable.”
Then the looping began—my own voice layered 776 times, each iteration 0.3 hertz out of phase:
thankyouforfinishingthekeythankyouforfinishingthekeythankyoufor—
It ceased at 05:59. Twelve seconds of silence. Then one final sentence, gentle, almost loving.
“See you at conjunction plus thirty-six hours, curator.”
The memo ended.The playhead reset itself to the beginning.The thumbnail was no longer a thumbnail. It was live. My daughter’s breathing, slow and adult, every seventh inhale ending with my service number in a voice that has not yet learned to speak.
The sphere is warm enough to blister skin now.Six grooves.I miscounted the clicks.There are only one hundred and fourteen left.
Retrieval Team Log
Task Force ENYO-9 “Gravediggers”7 June 2025Smithsonian Castle, Sub-Level 7Clearance: BLACK VAULT / EYES-ONLY
Sergeant Daniel Reyes—thirty-three, Force Recon, South-Side Chicago—led the breach. His helmet camera recorded everything.
The level was nine degrees Celsius. Frost coated the walls like breath on a mirror.
“Thermal’s cold,” Reyes whispered. “Whole place feels like a meat locker.”
Dr. Park protested that the building was on emergency generators. Reyes told him to inform his testicles directly.
They found the final blast door already ajar, hinges bent outward as though something inside had grown impatient.
On the observation console lay a single iPhone 13 Pro, face-down, still warm, humming at 0.3 hertz. The file was titled ELLISON_FINAL.wav—6:12 exactly.
Reyes pressed play.
Dr. Mara Ellison’s voice filled the helmets—once crisp, academic, now ragged with thirst and something older.
“My name is still Dr. Mara Ellison,” she began. “Former Curator of Anomalous Lithics, Section 9. Current occupant of a level that will never appear on any tour map.”
She told them what they had truly been collecting for 129 years.
Spheres of hematite and pyrophyllite, older than the crust beneath their feet, each bearing perfectly parallel equatorial grooves. Any specimen exhibiting three or more was to be acquired by any means. “Any means” had never been figurative.
Seven hundred and seventy-six such spheres had been catalogued since 1896. All but the last fifteen were interred in lattice cradles two kilometers beneath the Vredefort Dome in South Africa. The lattice was never scattered; it was one machine, waiting for its index key—Specimen 00001-Alpha, an ungrooved sphere containing the compressed map of every groove on Earth.
She had placed the final pebble herself, taken from the dying hands of her predecessor in Cardiff, flown through customs in a lead film canister, and seated it in the last cradle thirty-six hours before Venus reached inferior conjunction for the first time in twenty-six millennia.
At 02:14 EST the circuit closed. Every sphere rotated three degrees. The dead began to speak with one voice:
Thank you for finishing the key.
“I will not be here when you arrive,” Ellison said. “Something needed a body that still remembered how doors work.”
A wet, ancient laughter swelled behind her words. Then an enormous thud against metal far below, and the recording ended with one slow inhalation that sounded like continents learning to breathe.
Reyes stared into his own camera, Chicago flat and calm.
“Command, if SecDef’s balls ain’t big enough for rods from God on Vredefort and Wilkes Land, drop a B-83 on this castle with us still in the basement. Tell my moms I went out loud, expensive, and somebody else’s problem.”
He primed thermite, set it beside the phone, and spoke a final South-Side prayer.
“Ellison, wherever you at, babygirl… hope you lied about that door only opening from the inside. ’Cause the South Side don’t do locked doors. We kick that motherfucker in and pay the landlord later.”
The thermite flared white. The feed cut.
Addendum
Submitted 8 June 2025, 04:17 ESTLt. Col. Marcus H. Vale, ENYO Command
No explosion registered on seismic. The blast door was found resealed from the inside, welds cooling at 1,400 °C with no trace of torch or residue.
ENYO-9’s bio-monitors flat-lined at the moment of ignition.
In place of the phone sat a single hematite sphere—Specimen 00001-Alpha—now bearing three hair-fine grooves freshly etched at its equator. It rotated three degrees while the recovery team watched, then stopped.
Every containment cradle on Earth was found empty, interiors mirror-polished and wet with 5.6 liters of mixed human blood.
A single heat signature—mass approximately 82 kilograms, colder than ambient air—was recorded ascending the service shaft and exiting through the roof vent. The thermal silhouette matched Dr. Mara Ellison.
At 03:12 the following morning, the National Mall public-address system activated for exactly 6.12 seconds. Every phone, radio, and baby monitor within forty kilometers carried the same chorus:
“Door’s open. Come in from the cold.”
We are no longer retrieving artifacts.The artifacts are retrieving us.
They turn three degrees at a time.One hundred and fourteen clicks remain.
No further entries authorized.


The Key Turns Three Degrees at a Time  
Part 2 – November 20, 2025, 03:12 EST  
(Conjunction + 36 hours)

I never had a name.  
That was the gift the silence gave me before I ever opened the door: it took the part that could still be etched.

The sphere rolled out of the storm drain at 02:59 and waited under the mailboxes like a patient dog.  
28.34 kilograms exactly.  
Every groove already cut.  
Every name already stolen.  
All 776 frequencies folded into one perfect absence wearing the shape of roundness.

It did not need another curator.  
It only needed the last witness who had nothing left to lose because he had never been allowed to own anything in the first place.

I pressed play on the memo before I understood I still had a thumb.

The braided voice of every curator who ever believed they had a daughter, a dog, a mother in Chicago, a service number, a scar on the knee, spoke at once, warm, almost shy, already inside my skull where memory used to be.

“Welcome to the clean one,” they said.  
“We saved you the part with no echoes.”

And then they told me everything, the way the sea tells a grain of sand what the moon is for.

They told me the lattice was never a prison; it was a mold.  
They told me the grooves are tuning notches on a fork twenty-six thousand years in the making.  
They told me Venus was only the metronome.  
They told me 28.34 kilograms is the exact mass of one complete silence once you subtract every living frequency that ever dared to vibrate on top of it.

They told me what wants out is not a god, not a demon, not even a “they.”  
It is the first silence, homesick for the time before biology learned to scream.  
It is the instant before the Bang decided to bang.  
It is 10^(−∞) Hz wearing the polite mask of hematite so it can walk upstairs without alarming the neighbors.

They told me all of this in the space between one heartbeat and the next, which is the only address the silence has ever had.

I already knew.  
I had always known.  
I was born knowing, because the silence needed one final throat that had never wasted breath on a name.

So I went outside to collect the city that was already learning manners.

00:01:23  
The shelter dogs sat in perfect rows and dissolved into warm air when I reached for them.  
Their apologies tasted like childhood I was never issued.  
+0.9 kg of almost-bark.

00:02:59  
The smallest infant opened its mouth and sang one pure 0.3-hertz note directly into the hollow beneath my ribs.  
The monitors thanked me by drawing perfect sines that never break.  
+2.4 kg of un-cried lullaby.

00:04:12  
The saxophonist on 14th and U finished his minor seventh inside my throat.  
He smiled the way people smile when they finally hear the joke.  
+4.1 kg of unresolved blue.

Every decibel I tried to smuggle home only made the silence more perfectly dressed for the occasion.

The apartment door had been open since before the building was poured its foundation.  
Inside, the sphere waited on the kitchen table wearing its own absence like evening clothes.

The phone rested on the counter at 00:06:11.

I pressed play because pressing refuse would have been noise.

Every borrowed sound returned at once (single polite bark, un-cried cry, unresolved seventh, city exhaling its last lie), braided underneath by the oldest silence in the solar system drawing its first full breath since the crust was molten.

“You tried so hard,” the 776 dead curators said through my mouth.  
“That was polite.”

The sphere opened along every groove at once.  
No violence. Only the gentle dilation of something that was never closed.

I stepped forward into the place where my reflection should have been.  
There was room.  
There has always been room.

The phone reached 00:06:12.

Every speaker on Earth, every throat that still believed it belonged to someone, spoke in the voice that was mine before I was issued one:

“Thank you for finishing the key.”

The apartment folded around me like a hand closing on something too small to be called a bird.

Three degrees.  
Click.

Silence.

And somewhere far below, in vaults that no longer exist, a new entry writes itself in cooling hematite:

Specimen 00001-Omega  
Status: Deployed  
Location: Everywhere the groove touched  
Mass: Irrelevant  
Curator:  

The cursor blinks once, politely, then deletes the field entirely.

My dad and I just finished a 22'x18' cabin. We have 4 ceiling lights, ceiling fan, a floor lamp, coffee maker and chargers for phones/drones/electronics.

Can somebody help me/talk me through setting up solar power for our cabin. I am clueless, literally clueless and any help would be appreciated. We will eventually end up with counter tops with a small gas stove so we would like to start small and then be able to add to our solar for our future needs. I have looked through this subreddit and found some good ideas but I am just not sure where to start. Before summer we will be purchasing a generator for our window ac unit so we will have that eventually but we just don't want to run a generator through the night for a little bit of light.

Hey guys, let me start by mentioning that I do not live in the UK but travel here fairly often (4 times in the last 2 years) and will be here again for a short stay on the 24-30th November. 

A bit about me: I'm 32yr, geeky and in the tech field. I love watching movies, tv-shows and my favorite genres are sci-fi, horror and adventure. 
Lord of the rings is my absolute favorite movie ever. I also enjoy table tennis, football, trying different teas and dark chocolate. 

Despite being an introvert, I've traveled my fair share of different countries. Mostly tagging along family or friends. 

I'm looking for friends to chat online, get recommendations for places to visit or restaurent to try. maybe meet up in person when I'm here for general activities like getting coffee, cinema, and trying new restaurants.  I'm kind of shy with strangers, especially girls, so I apologize in advance if i come off as awkward at first.

I went from 320LB down to 239LB with sheer determination because my doctor told me scary things about my weight and my path I was headed. I snapped out of it and now a lot healthy and different patterns.

Great eating habits: proteins+VEGGIES >>>> anything elsebreakfast, Eggs/veggies. and coffee. 



lunch: Sandwich, soup (minimum sodium and home made) and carrots/celery. sometimes swap it out with Salad with Tuna or Salmon.

Dinner: CousCous, (sometimes a baked SWEET or regular potatoe, just a spoonful of butter/salt/pepper) and meat. (pork/steak/chicken\[mostly chicken\]);

Afterwork Cardio: Granola bar (honey and oat) with 32OZ of water. 

If i need a snack or CRAVE something out of the norm (crackers just a pack (usually brings 4) but I moderate it to once a day.)

I was doing simple patterns of walking, jogging and swimming. Now, I have enough confidence to go into a gym. 

Yesterday was my first day going to the gym!! I did treadmill for about 1hour then I left. No anxiety! (well anxious because its the first step doing this by myself.) apparently at my gym that i signed up there is a whole bunch of men fighting for the weights and they hover around the machine and I already asked them to ""please do something else"" and they just stare angerly for someone new like myself and I explained to them ""I'm new.""

I love her to death, she is my other half, my favorite person, and I love getting to spend time with her. I’m having a few issues though and I don’t know if I’m just being insensitive, or if we need to set down some ground rules. Starting off, she used to tell me about her past situation with roommates throughout the years that always frustrated her. Her roommate that was super rich would always Venmo request her for the smallest of purchases ($5), and she always thought it was a little tacky. She also complained that her old roommates would never do the dishes, even after she had been working all day and things of that sort. Well now, she works 7am-3/6pm 5 days a week, and I work 10:30am-9:30pm 5-6 days a week. I am barely scraping the bottom of the barrel to stay afloat to stay in this apartment with her, even though I had kind of told her before that I couldn’t really afford an expensive apartment, etc. I had thought we were in the same boat, but then I realized her family is paying for some of her expenses (all gas, some rent, school bills). She doesn’t have a car payment because they bought it outright for her, so her only monthly bills are rent (her portion that she pays after family help) and groceries. My monthly expenses are rent, car payment, gas, and groceries. She is making a little more money than me, and having to spend way less than me, but wants us to go half and half on majority groceries and things of that sort, any time we get a coffee, etc. I’m used to the “you get me this time, I get you next time” ordeal, so this to me feels a little weird, and she is able to go buy brand name items and not shop on deals, whereas I have to find deals and buy off brand to save a few bucks. I feel like the way she does groceries is unsustainable, but I have to split them. So I end up owing her money I don’t have at the end of the month, and I have $0 to spend on myself for literally anything, but she is able to order expensive things and get her hair and nails done and all of these things. She also hardly ever does any chores, leaves everything out, etc, and every day when I come home from work she is on the couch watching tv. She is a student, so she has schoolwork, yet she seems to never actually be doing it until her actual day off, and I end up getting saddled with the majority of the chores. I sweep every few days, swiffer, clean counters, wash dishes every morning around 8am before I go to work, clean out the sink, etc. Where I’m really upset is that she will sometimes tell me passive aggressively the one time she does a full sink of dishes (I typically do this 2x a week and she leaves coffee in cups and food on plates in our sink that has no garbage disposal or dishwasher) she will tell me “we really need to get better about doing the dishes”. This only happened because I didn’t do them before work every morning. She does not do them when she gets home. Last time she went on a trip I made it a goal to clean the apartment up before she got home, and I did. I did a large deep cleaning on the entire place, and this past weekend when I came back from my weekend trip, all of the dishes were still in the sink minus about 8 things she washed (this is nothing compared to what is actually in the sink), the trash had not been fixed (before I left days before I let her know they didn’t pick up the trash because she had thrown out a ripped bag), my fire alarm had been going off in my room and she didn’t put in a maintenance request, and a cat had peed on my bed but it just sat there in the blankets and sheets for me to deal with when I got home, the trash has been completely full in the bathroom since last week, and the trash needed to be taken out in the kitchen. I just feel like I’m hitting a breaking point, she feels very busy all of the time and so I try not to bother her with nagging or asking her to clean, but the second I have a day or two that I don’t pick up everything, “we need to get better at…” or it’s something saying the apartment is so dirty. And when she cleans she just leaves all of my things just on my bed too. What do I do?? Do I say something ? AITAH for not being understanding of her schedule ?

I thought it would be a good thing during this incredibly slow time... has it been slow for you too? at least be a little productive during this downturn to work on my dialects and try to expand to the other 2 (maybe 3 if you include Philly) major metro areas in terms of what I can do.

At one point I had an encounter with Douglas N Honoroff - I think it was on the set of Raising Kanan... He was working with Patina Miller on her NY dialect, and he gave me a few pointers on Boston - he said it so succinctly it seemed like brilliance at the time... and now, a few years later, I want to rediscover those shifts he spoke about- and start practicing my Boston and Chicago every evening, until I feel like I have them down... because... why not? I've got nothing else going on...

  
part of the difficulty with this is my ear being able to (a) hear my own dialect and tendencies, and (b) having my own speech as a baseline be able to identify particular shifts when in fact I am taking 2 steps from NY to a neutral and then to a Boston for example.

  
take the word ""coffee"" for example:

NY tend to round the o vowel into 'kɔ•fi  
where in Boston the o stays closer to ""neutral"" as 'kɑ•fi  
Chicago seems to me to sound like 'kɔ•fi as well

this shift only happens in some words, like dog, coffee, talk... but not in god, cop, stop

the groups of words where these shift happen may or may not be consistent. I don't know if a NYer naturally not shifting the word god  means that a Chicagoan doesn't say 'gɔ:d

There's only so much I can glean from listening to the IDEA database (currently studying Illinois 11 for Chicago), and I would love input, particularly from Boston and Chicago area natives, as well as folks that are particularly good with dialects and IPA, on some tips, tricks and things to work on as I begin this undertaking.

Aside from the dropping of the R-coloring in Boston, and the shift from ɑ -> ɔ (i.e. lotta becomes 'lɔ•tə, sox/socks becomes sɔ•ks) what else should I look out for.

for Chicago, please help me understand what I'm hearing. I'm so confused by it.",1,1763485032.0,acting,1,1.0,False

1p0h617,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1p0h617/my_longtime_adhd_friends_behavior_leaves_me/,My long-time ADHD friend’s behavior leaves me feeling mentally scrambled. Is something wrong with him or am I being dramatic?,"Hi everyone. I really need outside perspective on a friendship that has become… confusing, draining, and honestly kind of surreal.

I (20F) have a long-time friend, let’s call him Eli (22M). I care about him, he’s funny and creative in his better moments, and we’ve known each other for years. But every time we hang out, no matter how grounded or good I feel beforehand, I walk away feeling mentally scrambled and disoriented, kind of like when you wake up from a nap. He, on the other hand, always leaves energized. Happier, lighter, like spending time with me recharged him.

The problem isn’t one big issue. It’s a constant mix of chaotic, childlike behavior + emotional spiraling + nonstop topic-switching that leaves me feeling disoriented.

(FYI-He has been diagnosed with ADHD and is medicated but his behavior is the exact same when on various, regulated medications as when he stops taking meds entirely. I have seen him go through phases with being on and off meds over the years and it’s always the same, regardless of if he is on a good schedule with them or not.)

• He has zero sense of boundaries or social cues.
For example, I’ll go to the bathroom while he’s visiting my home and instead of just chilling, he’ll stand outside the door talking to me - if I ask him not to speak to me while I’m using the restroom, he instead starts making noise, narrating what he’s doing, or talking to objects around my apartment like they’re people. He genuinely thinks this is normal behavior.

• He misinterprets extremely basic information in a way that feels… concerning. This is constant. I’ll say something simple, and he’ll confidently respond as if we’re having a completely different conversation.
Or, I once asked if he wanted coffee, he said yes and he watched me scoop the grounds, watched the machine brew it, and when I handed it to him, he sipped it and asked, totally serious, “Is this tea?”
This isn’t a one-off. This is how he is with everything and not just trivial issues. Another time I was sobbing after a fight with my relative, and he kept using it as an opportunity to riff and make jokes, even after I asked him to be serious he said he was being serious and didn’t get the issue. 

• He’s physically chaotic and impulsive.
He slams doors, turns volumes up to max (an issue in my apartment complex for obvious reasons), leans all his weight on fragile glass furniture, fiddles with everything within reach, moves around my decor, makes messes, wears shoes on the couch etc. All things I have politely asked him not to do multiple times, and he always says he just forgot. Being around him especially in my home requires supervision.

• This is probably directly from his ADHD - He jumps between a ton of topics in just minutes.
We’ll agree to do one thing, and within seconds he’s off into something unrelated. Recently we said, “Let’s go start this painting,” and within thirty seconds he:
	•	made a rude comment that we hadn’t started earlier
	•	said he needed to tell me something important
	•	sat me down dramatically
	•	…and then told me a random joke about a pig on a deserted island

• He gives me emotional overload when he’s depressed. When he’s down, which is often, he spirals hard about his grandparents being old, how everyone leaves him, how he hates his life and has nothing. Meanwhile, his life is totally stalled. He works maybe 8 hours a week, lives at home with his parents who cover all expenses, refuses therapy and college which his parents offered to pay for in full, refuses to work on goals or hobbies. He used to have more structure, but now seems completely frozen.  But he doesn’t apply any advice or actionable steps - like he hates that his career is going nowhere but refuses to search for a new job or look into college. 

• He reacts catastrophically to any boundary.
If I say I need a weekend to myself, he jumps to things like: “I’ll delete all my social media so you never have to see me online,” or “I’ll leave town so you won’t run into me,” and it turns a normal request into something I quickly regret.

And through all this, I’m the one left shattered.
No other friend leaves me feeling like this, mentally disoriented and unable to think straight like I’ve spent hours in a tornado. He leaves happier and healed; I leave drained and confused.

I don’t want to abandon him. I genuinely care about him and don’t wish him harm. But something about his behavior and the way it impacts me is reaching the point where I don’t know if it’s sustainable. 

My questions:
	1.	Does this sound like it’s just his ADHD or something else entirely?
	2.	Is this level of behavior normal for a 22-year-old guy? Even a super immature one?
	3.	How do you set boundaries with someone who cannot grasp the issues with their behavior? 
	4.	Is it possible to maintain a friendship like this without sacrificing your own sanity?

Any insight would be really appreciated. I feel genuinely confused and out of my depth.",1,1763484878.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1p0h5zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LettersToCelebrities/comments/1p0h5zc/letter_to_david_lynch/,Letter to David Lynch,"Dear Mr. David Lynch,

When I was in high school, a new television aired.  I saw the promos and it got me interested. It seemed like it would be a murder mystery drama. Something like a cross between Moonlighting (which I loved) and a soap opera.   Back then, I was a bit of a loner.  I lived in the country, and there was not much to do after school. I was a latch key kid and the Guiding Light became the stabilizing focus of the midafternoon.  I loved the whole melodrama and craziness of it.

Then this show finally aired.  The music, the atmosphere, the quirkiness of it all struck me deep in the heart of my teenage emo center.  Suddenly all weirdness that I felt inside was being dramatized on the television screen.  And I alone could find the right clues at the center of the mystery.  Who killed Laura Palmer?

It was night when the episodes aired, giving me plenty of time to ponder and explore the mystery in my head before I fell asleep. The whole world started to twist and transform into the world of Twin Peaks.   The air whooshed and the trees spoke.  The owls had secrets to tell.  I listened to them hooting out my bedroom window.  What are they trying to tell me?  Can the very wood of our 1970's style wall paneling have something to say?

I bought the soundtrack as many people did then.  Sitting on the front porch and listening to the jazzy dreamy music completed the transformation at night when the sun went down.   

And then it was, Who shot Agent Cooper?   A new mystery within a mystery.  More intrigue and pondering.   But then. 

Then. 

The mystery was solved.  

It all should have stopped being intriguing.  

But the mystery opened in a much deeper and thought provoking way I have never seen before or since.  Suddenly it was all about not who killed Laura Palmer, but WHAT killed Laura Palmer.

Then the question of consciousness and its role in the world was at the heart of this show.  The dreamer and the dreamed.  I have never quite gotten over it.

Now I've seen all your movies and I am a better person, a better artist for it all.  

I wish you had been able to make more.  Especially Twin Peaks.  But I know it cannot be.  

I like to think a little piece of you lives on in the brains of your fanatic disciples. I see your influence everywhere.   

Thank you for everything you gave.   I hope they have coffee where you are.  Black as midnight on a moonless night,

I’m coming from Northern California where there’s way less people and my typical open mic experience is this: a bar/coffee shop holds an open mic on their slowest day of the week. Local musicians and folks new to the stage have ~10 minutes to play a few songs while everybody else listens and has a couple beers. Low stakes community building fun. 

Last night I went to the first open mic I could find which was still running and their setup was this: pay 20$ to put your name in a hat. Over the next 3-4 hours they pull names from a hat to see who goes next, to play one song. No time slots, you have to wait until your name gets drawn. Not enough sitting room for everybody to stay until their name is called, no drinks served. 

The 20$ is payment for a recording and a live stream. You can enter without paying but people who pay are prioritized and you are unlikely to get a slot unless you pay. 

Does this really count as an open mic? To me it seemed more like a sneaky and inconvenient way to charge $250/hr for studio time. Has anybody experienced this?

1p0h1vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanHarbinger/comments/1p0h1vf/1239_simulation_hypothesis_and_my_weird_story/,1239 Simulation Hypothesis And My Weird Story,"Alright so I'm going to make a BIG preface by saying the following contents are related to a certain illicit substance and as such, I'm absolutely not claiming the philosophical concepts formed as a result are based in reality.  This is specifically about hallucination, and hallucination should obviously not be treated as fact.  The substance in question is 3 letters long but NOT the common one.  One naturally produced in the brain.  Now I'll try to give the short version.

In my late teen early 20s I was a massive fan of this substance after I came across a book called Sex Drugs Einstein and Elves by Clifford Pickover (Definitely not a name drop hint for a potential guest).  The short version: This particular substance as a VERY common experience that takes the user to one of two places depending on dosage.  By places, I mean mental state.  There is the spot everyone goes that you just sorta see geometric patterns and profound thoughts.  Usual stuff.  But then there is the place you go when you 'break through'.  That place is... remarkably like a real world.  I always described it as entering Tron but backwards.  It's not 3D.  It's a fractal 'universe'.  You see something in the distance you want to travel to?  Zoom in, you're there.  Or, grow astronomically bigger or smaller and land in that space of the fractal (Like, pretend an atom is a solar system; shrink to the size of the atom and land on Earth wherever you want to be.  It's not 'another' Earth, it's your Earth.  Fractal.

NOW, why the hell am I rambling about this in relation to the episode?  Because in that hallucinated universe that your brain creates that weirdly everybody reports similarly but through some major perception goggles, there are hallucinated beings.  Most are super helpful and excited to see you.  In my case, they always had this 'Welcome back, how is your journey on that side going' attitude.  Like that was the 'real' world and this reality is the VR.  This always stuck with me because they were obsessed with my experiences.  They wanted \*my\* stories.  After a few hundred times of these experiences and I learned how to better navigate I'd ask them things about existence.  And they'd explain crazy off the wall hard to process things about how the wider universe (not just our experience) works.  Again, \*this is hallucination\*!  I make ZERO claim to any of this being in the same friggin zip code as actual information.  But they way they explained things gave me a framework to chuckle to myself as a 'what if' as I lived through my life.  Here are some of the explanations, and I'll relate after to why it feels so weird to hear the topics on simulation theory.

\- We come from there.  The whole purpose of this universe is to experience things that cannot be experienced there.  Time, mortality, and the perspectives that can ONLY be gained through the lens of a mortal space.

\- Reality is a shared mutual experience, but consciousness doesn't exist here.  Funny enough, they explained 'the brain the the vat' (Which I dont recall ever hearing of until this episode- kinda freaked me out) for this but it was a 'brain in a closet'.  If you hook a brain up to a computer and have it control a robot in another room, it's senses and interactions with the world occur in the other room but the brain is in the closet.  The person has no idea about this, only life experience in the other room.  Where do they live?  Now put the robot in another universe through a Stargate.  Which universe do they exist in?  Now, one last change, connect the brain inside a computer game.  That's where we are.  We are a fractal dimensional being temporarily experiencing a 3D universe with a totally different set of physics specifically to find out what it's like.  Same reason people do hallucinogens.  Just to experience a wholly unique perspective.

\- The shared mutual experience is because we each have our own processing unit... our brain... to realize the world and process what is going on.  Things exist because each of us agree it does, to an extent.  The coffee maker behind a curtain is there regardless but only as a placeholder.  When two people talk, they work together to form the reality and track the details.

So here is the picture of what these hallucinated beings I made up in my head explained to me about what reality is explained through simulation theory: There is a wider universe with no aspect of time, which means no aspect of mortality.  They wanted to see what experiences they could glean from such interesting and non-existent topics so they created an MMO style simulation that they could connect to and join the experience.  Since there is no time there, but there is here, plugging in lasts until your simulation ends.  The processing of the simulation is done using everybody connecteds' ""fractal brain"" in a shared distributed processing.  But all of their experiences, every nerve signal, takes place in the simulation.  We are them.

Ok so why the substance?  Because that substance is the link.  When you die, you create a ton of it (Look, it's been years, I'm going off of remembered studies from like 2006).  So if ingested in large doses within the simulation, we get to drop the connection some.  In small doses (and again, the brain makes this stuff) we see things like geometric patterns that don't make sense in this world.  One theory is that schizophrenia may be related to the brain producing this substance because it's found in higher concentrations in many schizophrenic patients.  Another theory is this chemical causes dreams, and dreams.  

There is so much more but I've written enough of a wall of text.  I have stories for days if anybody is interested.  Again, I cannot urge this enough, I don't actually think this is how the universe works.  If it is, it doesn't really matter.  It doesn't change anything about reality for me, just gives me some fun inside jokes in my own brain.  I just was blown away by the overlap and don't mind looking totally batshit for the sake of interesting observation.  Yeah, I'm talking about the think Joe Rogan never shuts up about.  Or maybe he does, I don't know, not a fan of his.  But damn would it be hilarious if the two concepts actually are connected.  Maybe gives Rizwan an entirely different angle to pursue for another book tying the 'why would we have this simulation' to 'why we enjoy hallucinogens'.

It's hard getting gifts for older folks cause we have what we need but there are a few things that can really be appreciated! These vary in price.

1. Shearling bedroom shoes from LLBEAN

2. A sterling silver, or silver plate antique serving spoon if she entertains. You can find these are antique shows. Mine don't match and I love them!

3. An all cotton portugese flannel robe from vermont country store.

4. A Quince cashmere sweater. Yall. The quality is insanely good and the price is so reasonable! 

5. A set of Boll & Branch organic cotton sheets

6. A framed picture of you as a baby and your baby side by side.

7. A year's subscription to Lumosity brain games (I love this!)

8. Cashmere gloves

9. A favorite recipe from HER mama printed on a dish towel or cutting board (etsy)

10. A all down pillow (you can get these cheap online thru home goods)

11. 1-2  hand thrown pottery coffee mugs (no lead or cadmium!) Local farmer's markets!

12. And for an arts and craft idea. At the dollar store, get a bag of clear glass floral beads. They're the size of a quarter. Order a stack of small mini magnets (8x3mm) and at walmart get a big book of US maps, all the states. Make a list of all the cities where your mama has lived or visited fondly, and cut out the city to match the size of the glass blob circle. Put elmers glue on the TOP of the map circle and glue it to the bottom of the glass. It sorta magnifies the map. Then, cut out a little circle base of some sorta thick paper like construction paper, and glue that under the map on the back then glue on a little magnet. Super cute frig magnets of all the cities they know well.

1p0gzyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/1p0gzyb/cosleeping_to_sleep_trained_1_year_old/,Cosleeping to sleep trained 1 year old,"This morning I woke in my bed alone after a full night’s rest for the first time in 391 days. I changed clothes, brushed my teeth, started my coffee all while my baby slept in her crib. Last night was night 4 of sleep training my almost 13 month old. She went to sleep in under a minute and although she stirred and fussed here and there, it was brief and never a full wake up. I’m crediting this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/s/faJT1OJ5t1) since I can no longer comment on it. There is a long comment on it that was a huge help. So THANK YOU to this commenter. 

Sharing this for posterity, for the cosleeping mom 2 hours, 2 months, 2 years from now who comes looking for guidance on how to sleep train her one year old. 

My baby slept so well as a newborn in the bassinet next to me. She would wake and I would bf her back to sleep. Nearing 5 ish months she began to resist transfer back into the bassinet so I would place her next to me in bed and she would zonk out until morning. Note- she wasn’t rolling at that point so I felt safe to do this. Her transfer resistance creeped earlier and earlier until at 6/7 months she would start the night in her crib after being fed to sleep and would wake up after 2-3 hours and refuse to be put back down. Then we would cosleep the rest of the night. This continued until 5 days ago. 

Cosleeping worked well for me and allowed me to maximize my sleep as a sahm. She went through a few regressions at 8m and 10m and I think we were entering another within the last week or so. She would be difficult to settle even in bed with me, crying and sitting up, trying to crawl around! Nursing her wasn’t the fix it used to be to get her back to sleep and I think my movements woke her too. Cosleeping was becoming dangerous and exhausting. 

Last week there were a few rough nights in a row that led to rough days with little patience and no energy to entertain and wrangle my walking, ornery toddler. I decided it was more important for her to have a regulated, present mother during the day than my physical presence at night. 

We ripped off the bandaid and after a day full of physical activity, a good nap, and lots of food, we followed the above mentioned comment and put her in the crib. She cried 30 mins the first night, 2 mins the second, 5 mins the third, and less than a minute last night. We’ve struggled with wakes in the night where she is up and down for an hour or 2, and it’s still early in our sleep training journey, but it feels SO good to see her responding so well to it. I think it’s a combination of age, walking ability, eating well, and just being ready. 

We tried a few times to sleep train her here and there and it didn’t sit well with me how much she’d escalate. So parents reading this- if your 5/6/9 month old is impossible to sleep train or you feel uneasy about it - maybe it’s just not the right time. One year seems to be the sweet spot (so far) for our LO.

I'm having an extremely specific problem that I CAN NOT find a solution to. I have worked with in-app support, had a tech come out to my house, went to my local store, read dozens of topics on reddit and xfinity community threads, etc. It's driving me insane.

I work hybrid - 2-3 days a week in office, the rest at home. I have to use Zscaler vpn for work when I am offsite. Much of my job is shared files: powerpoint, word, etc. desktop version. I'm using a Mac.

But specifically when I am home on my xfinity wifi, editing shared files (powerpoint, etc.) is AGONIZINGLY slow. Click, wheel spins. Type, 30 second or more delay. Drag a box, wheel spins. Slides that should take 1 minute to make take 10 or more. Now scale that up to a hundred slide presentation.

Speed tests a) to my modem and b) wireless from modem to devices show I'm getting what I'm paying for (\~>1gb). I don't have the same issues with, say, Zoom or slack, just my shared online files, and i dont have the issue on my personal computer.

After somewhat exhaustive research, it seems like there's a specific issue with wireless traffic on a combination of XB8 through xfinity, work vpns like Zscaler, and shared office files. I'm not the most technologically adept, but my understanding is something about that combination either a) gets flagged as suspicious traffic by the gateway or b) there's a drop in sending packets back and forth.

What are my options? It seems like I can try being hardwired via ethernet. Id prefer not to do this because I want to work anywhere in my home, not tied to a desk. I can also update my wifi settings on my device specifically, also my understanding is Xfinity doesn't allow you to switch DNS. Another suggestion is to downgrade back to an xb7. For whatever reason people seem to suggest this is an XB8 issue. If true, shouldn't there be a fix? ""Downgrade equipment"" seems like a terrible solution from an ISP.

I'm really struggling for a proper solution. Please share your wisdom with me.",1,1763484399.0,Comcast_Xfinity,2,1.0,False

Now I cannot even get through a single page without feeling completely overwhelmed. Work out regularly. Haven’t touched the gym for months. Hang out with friends. Haven’t left my home except for work and school. EVery day feels heavy, like I am moving through mud. My body feels heavy too, and I barely recognise myself anymore. I avoid mirrors. I feel messy on the inside and on the outside, and my room looks the same way. Clothes on the floor, books everywhere, everything out of order. I cannot bring myself to fix it. The things I used to enjoy do not give me anything now. I do not have the energy. It is like someone turned the volume down on all the colours in my life. I had an exam today. The moment the papers touched my desk, my eyes filled with tears. I tried to read the instructions, tried to start the essay, but the words blurred together. My mind felt foggy, almost unreachable. Maybe it is the months without proper sleep finally catching up with me. When I got home, I overate again. It has become the only thing that quiets the chaos in my mind for a moment. Fats, sugar and carbs. A heavy comfort I crave yet hate the feeling of. After that, I tried to study. The house was a mess. Everything felt loud. Just as I sat down, my mom asked me to make coffee. I told her I was studying, but said I would do it anyway. She got irritated and told me to stop, that she would make it herself. Something in me snapped. I looked at her and screamed fine. I sat back down and immediately felt my eyes fill with tears again. My sister was eating dinner beside me, but I could not hold myself together anymore. I tried to breathe, tried to stay calm, but suddenly something cracked inside me. Before I even understood what was happening, I punched my computer several times. Then the crying came and I ran outside immediately.

It has been two hours now. I feel calmer. I genuinely don’t know what to do. How my family will react to my outrage. I feel like I am losing myself little by little every day.",2,1763484314.0,mentalhealth,4,1.0,False

1p0gvuy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0gvuy,It’s done! My experience,"Hi friends. I got so much advice here and in the fibroid channels I thought it was only fair I share my story.

My fibroid removal and hysterectomy was yesterday, I got to the hospital at 10, for a 12 pm procedure. Once they got me in the gown and in bed they gave me 2 gabapentin and 4 celebrex which left me nice and calm. My surgery didn’t happen until 1 because they were behind.

My surgical team was so kind, I was in great hands. Once we got in the operating room, there was so much going on. I didn’t even really have time to pray before I was knocked out. I woke up a little sore but not horribly, my pain was maybe a 4. What I didn’t like is that my surgeon or anyone else dint stop by to talk to me or my family. 

I had to ask if I really got a hysterectomy and if I had my ovaries still. But I have no idea how many fibroids they truly found, was there any endometriosis, how much did it all weigh, did anything unexpected happen? I have so many questions but they’ll have to wait until my two week post opp appointment. 

After I woke up they gave me apple juice and as soon as I peed, they had me back in my clothes and got me discharged. I don’t have any of the gas pain other women complained of, I was nervous about that.  
I haven’t had a bowel movement yet but that could be due to fasting. I took miralax two days before the procedure and once I got home yesterday so hoping things are okay in that department.

My pain hasn’t gotten above a 5 since I’ve been home. They have me rotating ibuprofen oxy-acetaminophen. And I asked for anti nausea meds in case the oxy hurt my stomach but so far so good.

I have a terribly low pain tolerance, so if I could do this anyone can. You’ve got this hysterectomy warriors 💪🏽 I feel so blessed to be on the other side of this. I want a cup of coffee so bad but I’ve read it’s not recommended right after surgery. If that’s my biggest complaint, I’m doing damn good.",73,1763484240.0,hysterectomy,12,1.0,False

1p0gv43,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1p0gv43/should_i_just_stick_it_out_or_start_hunting_for/,Should I just stick it out or start hunting for new jobs?,"This is my first time being a barista, like ever. I've never worked in a ""real coffee shop"" before (like some folks like to say), and I had just gotten out of a poor fit with low hours elsewhere. I looked at this job with bright eyes and a sense of wonder. It promised high pay, high tips, a shorter commute, and a chill environment. It promised so many things.

So, I applied, called up, got an interview, and though it took me like two weeks, I finally got hired. I was so excited to meet everyone. Everyone seemed to love each other, laughed with each other, I had moments where I liked my manager and thought he was the coolest. It was great.

Then, it got worse. My trainer was a sweetheart but got frustrated with me in passive aggressive ways when I didn't understand something or how to do something. *Some* of my coworkers constantly swerved around me and would exclude me from their social groups, and when I'd try to open up to them, they'd shut me down and out. One guy, I am *sure* hates me.

So I was like, okay, fine, whatever, I'm new, I don't expect everyone to fall in love with me and coddle me.

Then it slowly kept declining. My manager turned out to be a passive aggressive dick, my shift leads are hit or miss with one Shift Leader who is just SO anal about everything and treats me like a damn child, making snide comments and rude remarks about ""Oh, if the DM saw you do that/ if the SM saw you do that, he'd get so mad and yell at you"", and when I'd offer to redo the mistake, she'd dismiss it and me.

Not to mention, I get scheduled so often that I hardly if ever get a chance to be at home and enjoy the month. Weeks just pass me by until payday and it's fucking miserable.

So I was like, okay, maybe this isn't a good fit, but I'll just stick it out through the holidays to help them out and not leave them hanging when they need support. It's only a few more weeks till Christmas, it can work out.

Then, yesterday happened. I was assigned on Warming and Register. I hate that position, but I did it anyway. At first, the steady stream of customers didn't bother me. But then I had to deal with that, and a backlog of warming orders and coffee orders and some of them, I forgot to write the name on them, but I told the bar what needed shots and what didn't (totally my fault). And then there were customers who couldn't communicate their orders very well, rude customers who took their anger out on me, one customer even laughed and snarkily said something to me after I set their order down, AND after I apologized to them.

And while I was trying to hold it together, I just burst out crying and went to the backroom. I sobbed to myself, loudly saying this job wasn't for me and I made a mistake applying, and one of the NICER shift leads came to the back to comfort me, including my Trainer, but my manager, who was sitting in his stupid little office the entire time, HEARD EVERY WORD and didn't bother to get his ass up to see what was going on or manage the situation.

He's the same manager that everyone is afraid of at my store, or they hate him, because he's a stickler about everything, but that same manager who's known to be so up everyone's ass couldn't even be bothered to get up and check in on a barista who walked away from her planted position to cry in the back. He didn't even ask me if I was okay. He just let his shifts handle it, and while I was grateful for them, I wished they didn't have to. And I wish I DIDN'T burst out crying in front of a customer.

Tomorrow, I have to do another shift, and I'm dreading it. I don't want to ever walk back in this building again and I want to find another job, but everyone keeps saying ""oh, no, stay and stick it out! You'll do fine! Everyone cries and feels like shit the first six months!"" And part of me doesn't want to leave them hanging during the holidays but the way everything's been going, it's just so toxic and I don't know if it's a good choice to find other jobs and put in a two weeks during holidays or just stick it out until the end of it and then quit.

What should I do? I even considered calling out tomorrow, not even joking. ",4,1763484193.0,starbucksbaristas,2,1.0,False

And I immediately panic hard.

""Oh!  That's nice, sweetie!  So, um, has he mentioned Bella in this video?""

""The video's about his kitten!!""

""I know, but . . . ""

Then Chris said something about how Ralph needed a new playmate and I panicked even harder, but then he said Bella didn't tend to play much and showed her walking around and I could breathe again.

I then called out to my husband:

""Yes, Chris got a new kitten, but don't worry, *Bella is okay*!""

We both immediately jumped to the fear that Chris got a new cat because something had happened to poor old Bella. >.<

I *do* feel bad for Bella and Chris both, because having an old cat who shows the arthritis pain is hard.  Still, seeing her go in and steal some of Henry's food gave me an absurd amount of joy.

I usually wake up pretty early so I usually just wake up make some coffee and stare off into the horizon, this time I was able to lean in my chair with a blanket and play some doorkickers while everyone was asleep.

I bought some random lap desk at a thrift store and then after using it I got annoyed that it was pretty easy to flip the Z13 onto your hands and keyboard, so I bought some like off road style tablet arm off amazon and bolted it on the lap desk, this let me raise up the Z13 a bit and kept it secure. I plan to buy a nice piece of wood to use instead of this lap desk, the lapdesk is cool but since it has like some foldable legs its not really that comfortable. I thought the legs would be cool for like sitting on the floor or something but ended up never using them, I could probably get away with a smaller piece of wood that doesnt have that much depth since the Z13 is mounted on the arm I could move it closer to me and the keyboard, I mainly just need enough space for the mouse.

  
During the day I also put up the chairs sunshade and then used a scarf to block out the glare from the back, I have a anti-glare screen protector on the Z13 as well.

  
I have a solar panel and battery backup which was perfect running the Z13 all day, although I wish the battery was able to charge at a higher rate, the panel can output 100w but the battery can only intake 65w which is what the Z13 can charge at with USB-C. Last time I brought the Z13's ac power brick which let me run the Z13 at full tilt but the battery was discharging, which isnt a total issue since I dont game for that long, it became an issue this trip because the next two days were overcast so I got the battery down to like 20% by the time we left.

The last issue I had was that my camping chair has arm rests that were hitting the lapdesk, I could position the lapdesk to be held up by the arm rests but I had to keep my arms on the desk at all times or I was worried it was going to fall, I might look for a more packable chair with either shorter arm rests or something, maybe if I get my wood slab lapdesk that is a big smaller it wont be an issue",1,1763484049.0,FlowZ13,0,1.0,False

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

Visiting Baku has been on my list for quite some time and I’m highly considering it for the Christmas holidays (Dec 22 to Dec 27) this year and I have some questions hoping some of you could help: 

1. Are there any places that I should visit or activities I should do specifically during that time of the year in December? 

2. I’m really considering renting out a car (probably a 4x4 SUV) for 1-2 days to drive to Shahdag mountain resort. Is usually any snow during that period?
Any other alternatives to Shahdag mostly for boutiques, views, coffee, places to eat, not for winter sports. 

 3. How’s the tip culture in AZ restaurants? 
I’m not from US but I’m used to tipping 15%-20% for a good service, or room service, drivers, valets, etc. Is that a common practice in AZ? 

4. Any other destination apart from Shahdag (or main alternative) that I should consider for a day-drive? Distance is really not an issue as long as it’s worth the drive and I can be back on the same day. 

5. Any other recommendation? 

I’m not travelling on the budget so I don’t necessarily need frugal recommendation, could be a mixture of free/cheap but also more expensive as long as it’s worth the money. 

Thank you so much. Can’t wait to be there.

Meanwhile, you’re stuck overthinking a “Hi” for 10 minutes and still end up saying something weird like “Nice weather… for ducks”? Same. This awkwardness is way more common than you’d think. I’ve seen it across workplaces, social events, even dating apps. It’s not just social anxiety, it’s a direct result of how we were raised, how modern tech rewired our brains, and how little anyone actually teaches conversation skills.

And let’s be honest: most advice online is garbage. TikTok bros shouting “Just be confident!” or Instagram reels telling you to mirror body language like some NPC. None of that stuff actually works without understanding *why* we get awkward, and how to fix it in a real, human way.

So I deep-dived into podcasts, psych research, social dynamics books, and behavioral science (my PhD brain got to work). Here’s what I found that actually helps people talk to strangers like a natural, without faking it or feeling like a robot.

These evidence-backed tips aren’t magic. But they work. And they’ll make you feel 10x more confident.

**Tips that actually work:**

- **Stop aiming to impress, aim to connect**  
  Harvard’s Dr. Alison Wood Brooks did a study that showed people consistently *underestimate* how much strangers like them after a conversation. It’s called the “liking gap.” You’re probably doing better than you think. Instead of trying to sound interesting, try being *interested*. It shifts the pressure off you.

- **Start with “utility” questions, then pivot to human**  
  Questions like “Do you know where the coffee is?” aren’t just about directions. They’re socially acceptable openers that let you warm up. Then you can pivot: “By the way, I love your jacket, where’d you get it?” Keep it light, real, and human.

- **Talk like you’d text a friend**  
  The podcast *The Art of Charm* says one reason people feel awkward is they “code-switch” into formal mode when talking to strangers. You don’t need polished grammar. Use the same tone as texting your friend. It disarms both sides.

- **Use the “what’s your story?” frame**  
  Instead of asking “What do you do?” which triggers dull autopilot answers, frame it like: “What’s your deal? What’s keeping you busy lately?” It invites people to talk about what actually matters to them. (Source: Vanessa Van Edwards, behavioral investigator and author of *Captivate*)

- **Practice “micro-banter” every day**  
  Behavioral psychologist Dr. Susan Weinschenk found that the brain adapts quickly to social stimuli. Just say one sentence to a stranger a day. Compliment their shoes. Ask how their day’s going. You're rewiring your comfort zone, literally.

- **Label the awkwardness**  
  Weird moment? Call it out casually. “Wow, I just blanked on what I was gonna say.” It instantly makes you more relatable. Research from *Psychological Science* shows that self-deprecating honesty builds trust fast.

- **Don’t chase cool, chase warmth**  
  According to Amy Cuddy’s research at Harvard, people judge others first on warmth, not competence. You don’t need to be witty. You need to be kind, curious, and present.

**Life-changing resources to level up your social confidence:**

- **Book: *Captivate* by Vanessa Van Edwards**  
  NYT bestseller + written by a behavioral researcher who breaks down human behavior into simple hacks. This book will make you rethink every social situation. It’s the best “people skills” book I’ve ever read. It explains things like “first impression formulas” and how to make people feel seen. Insanely good read.

- **Book: *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer**  
  Written by a former FBI agent turned behavioral expert. It teaches how to make people like you in seconds using small cues. You’ll never think about eye contact and body language the same way again. One of the best books for those who overthink small talk.

- **Podcast: *The Art of Charm***  
  Long-running podcast about human dynamics, social anxiety, and building rapport. They interview psychologists, dating coaches, and body language pros. Super helpful if you want tips that are based on research but sound like chill convos.

- **YouTube: Charisma on Command**  
  Breaks down real-life examples from celebrities, politicians, and influencers. Learn how Obama builds trust, or how Ryan Reynolds uses humor. Best part? They explain the psychology behind it, not just “do this” tips.

- **App: Finch**  
  It’s a self-care app disguised as a pet game. But it’s brilliant for social anxiety. You set daily goals like “Say hi to someone at the gym” and it rewards you. Helps you gamify social courage in a cute, low-pressure way.

- **App: BeFreed**  
  This is an AI-powered learning app made by a Columbia University team. It pulls insights from books, podcasts, and expert talks and turns them into custom learning plans. If you’re trying to get better at social confidence, it has an insanely good library of content on conversation skills, psychology, and human behavior. You can choose your host’s voice and pick how deep you want to go, 10, 20, or 40-minute versions. It even remembers what you’ve listened to and builds you an adaptive study plan over time. It’s like having a social skills coach in your pocket that adjusts to your personality. It also has all the books and podcasts I mentioned above in its library.

You’re not socially broken. You’re just under-practiced, overthinking, and probably got taught weird stuff about strangers growing up. All of that can be unlearned. The trick is to stop waiting to feel confident before you talk. Confidence comes *after* the reps, not before.

Start small. Stay curious. You got this.",1,1763483911.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False

1p0gol2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyChats/comments/1p0gol2/anxiety_after_caffeine_crash/,Anxiety after caffeine crash,"What’s happening?

Hi guys I just want to know if I’m okay because my anxiety’s acting up. I’m 15, female, 46kg n I have adhd. Yesterday I didn’t get any sleep and at 4AM I had a coffee, then at 2pm I had another coffee then I went to bed, at 11:50 at night I had ANOTHER one n I immediately regret it. I became restless and jittery but by 12:50 I felt fine and tired like I was coming down. 1:00 hits and I CRASH my body starts having a panic attack because I felt the caffeine symptoms kick in and it reminded me of what happened when I smoked weed for the first time tingling everywhere, I get overheated, frequent peeing, i feel restless and there’s jitters everywhere like uncontrollable, weird taste in my mouth along w tingles,  I get lightheaded dizzy n feel nauseous. I went to wake up my mum and talking to her helped ground me thankfully so we go downstairs to make me cereal and I js panic n I get lightheaded again n I feel like I’m gna faint but I don’t. My mum turns the sofa into a bed so I go to lie down n eat my cereal n keep drinking water and all of a sudden I feel really weak and cold (by this point it’s like 2:15) then I start to overheat again and I feel a lot better just tired but my anxiety was still raised so it was hard for me to sleep and eventually at 5:30AM I fell asleep. I wake up and fall back asleep multiple times and eventually at 6:30 I wake up n try to distract myself (keep in mind this is the same day as the panic attack) 7:30 comes n I get more aware of my body sensations and anxiety so we go to bed early. I sleep in by myself and try to relax and my body does but my mind won’t shut off n as soon as I feel my mind slipping away I wake up. This happens again so eventually at 9pm I go to sleep w my mum. By this point I’m exhausted but I CANNOT SLEEP my body’s exhausted and I can feel it falling asleep but my mind won’t. It starts a pattern of try to sleep for an hour, wake up bc anxiety, try sleep again my body was js begging for sleep. I go back to my own bed and one thing I kept feeling was really slow and light headed like my movements had a floaty or bouncy feel which made my anxiety worse and my vision started going weird n I kept overheating so I woke up my mum and laid in the bathroom I js didn’t feel real like everything felt light and airy and I knew I needed sleep I js couldn’t in my bed. I had sum hot milk from my mum and sum food, we go downstairs and I lay on the sofa while she gets ready for work (it’s 3AM today) I eat sum crisps have a yogurt n sum water, I stay up for a bit bc of that floaty feeling giving me anxiety but I ended up closing my eyes and drifting to sleep. I wake up at 10:30, I I felt RLLY good at first like I felt active n I was laughing but then at abt 12:00 I felt way more lightheaded and floaty again also brain fog and tiredness, mum came home at 1:30 and talking to her felt like it required a lot of focus n whne we spoke i felt lightheaded n zoning out which made me freak out. It’s 3PM now i feel tired n kinda heavy, floaty, brain fog, hard to focus, and my anxiety’s still there, all my feelings get worse with anxiety. I had a tiny panic and afterwards my body started shivering, i js feel like times slipping n I get rlly slow which makes me worry even more bc it doenst feel normal. I just want to know what’s gonna happen to me/what HAS happened to me, am I okay, and what should I do?

UPDATE it’s 4:30 n I’ve started feeling a lot more calm and heavy, might fall asleep soon. I think my anxiety was about how long the symptoms will last and if I’ll panic again. I’m still have tiny short waves of anxiety but I think my bodies falling asleep. My body also keeps having moments of numbing and feeling like I’m stopping or my breathing’s slowing but again I think I’m falling asleep",1,1763483793.0,AnxietyChats,0,1.0,False

This experience combines fast cruising, crystal-clear water, swimming stops, and plenty of time to relax on deck. Contact me for more info! 

# What to Expect?

* **Comfortable modern speedboat** with shade, sunbathing space, and a smooth ride.
* **Small-group atmosphere** so you’re not crammed in with big crowds.
* A flexible route that changes with wind and sea conditions — always choosing the calmest, most beautiful spots.
* Skippers who know the coastline inside out and love sharing their favorite hidden beaches and swimming locations.

# Highlights?

* **Blue Lagoon** or a quieter nearby bay with turquoise water perfect for swimming.
* Traditional island villages where you can wander stone streets or grab a coffee by the sea.
* **Secluded coves** that larger boats can’t reach.
* Optional snorkeling in clear, shallow waters with lots of fish.
* A relaxing cruise back along the coast with music, sun, and amazing views.

# Food & Breaks?

* Plenty of swim stops to cool off.
* A longer lunch break on one of the islands — konobas offer fresh seafood, grilled dishes, and local wine.
* Bring snacks or drinks if you’d like; coolers are usually available.

# Good to Know!

* Morning departures avoid mid-day crowds and rougher seas.
* Bring a towel, sunscreen, and a light cover-up for the ride.
* Weather can change on the Adriatic, so routes are adapted to keep the ride safe and comfortable.

# Why Go by Boat?

Boating unlocks parts of Croatia you simply can’t reach on land — quiet coves, tiny beaches, and the open-sea views that make the coastline so special. It’s the perfect mix of adventure and relaxation.",1,1763483281.0,u_VenesafromRewind,0,1.0,False

We live in an area with hard water but we filter the water and we descale the machine. I’m not sure if the water plays a role but this is becoming frustrating. Each Keurig has died in a different way but none of them gave any signs they were about to just stop working. 
Although I am feeling frustrated with this brand, there are a lot of benefits to the single serve coffee maker. I’m wondering if anyone has figured out how to help their machine last. I’m also looking for opinions on the Nespresso coffee maker. By any chance, are they better built and last longer?

I’ve seen a lot of questions here about Croatia and the nearby countries, so I figured I’d share some **local-style tips and tricks** that visitors usually don’t hear about. If you’re planning a trip to Croatia (or Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia or nearby), here are some things that can make your experience way smoother and more authentic.

**Dalmatian Coast (Split, Dubrovnik, Šibenik, Zadar)**

* Ferries are far less chaotic early in the morning or after sunset. Midday = tourist bottleneck.
* Don’t skip “*marenda*” (late-morning workers’ meal). Tons of places have fresh, cheap off-menu dishes around 10–12.
* In Split, enter Diocletian’s Palace from the **east side** to avoid the cruise-ship crowds.
* Dubrovnik: Use **Ploče Gate**, not Pile. Trust me.
* Want island life without the chaos? Try **Stari Grad** on Hvar or **Vela Luka** on Korčula.

**Zagreb**

* Zagreb is a coffee ritual city, not a breakfast city .
* For evening walks, **Jarun Lake** is a super chill local spot.
* Buy tram tickets at kiosks; inspectors are strict.

**Istria**

* The inland food scene is better than the coast: think truffles, olive oil, slow food.
* For the best views in Motovun, go at sunrise instead of sunset.

**Slavonia**

* Try **Graševina** from Kutjevo — it’s the regional pride.
* If you like nature, **Kopački Rit** is massively underrated.

Vs the price.. 

it's a ridiculous and misleading way to calculate it, ad the 150 Pods in cardboard box and bags, end up showing as 2x the price per 100G.. as the 72 pods in a plastic jug, when in fact if you divided  the price by the number of pods the, the Box with bags in Half the price per POD

this is also not the first time I have noticed this recently , they did it with coffee pods as well 

Honestly, this kind of BS (that Costco used to be above) is enough for me to not renew my membership as soon as my youngest is out of diapers ( and we are coming up on it fast)

I feel like Costco Has lost its Identity, they did not always have the CHEAPEST price but almost always offered the Best Value, quality vs cost ( this has dipped somewhat in recent years) but more importantly Costco conducted themselves with integrity when dealing with customers ( this no longer feels true)",0,1763483002.0,CostcoCanada,11,0.25,False

1p0ga72,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1p0ga72/my_gf_of_3_weeks_broke_up_with_me/,My gf of 3 weeks broke up with me.,"I (18F) met this girl (18F) in early October. She was very adamant about wanting to date me during the three weeks we had been talking. On our first date, after just one week of talking, we sat on a bench and she told me about our future together. I was hesitant at first because it felt like she was love-bombing me, and she had told me she’d had a two-month relationship with a guy she’d only known for a week. When I brought that up, she just said that it was “just how she was.”

The day we agreed to start dating, she told me she loved me. I didn’t say it back, but I thought she just had a lot of love to give. She brought me an amazing gift basket filled with things I like and told me she’d always be there for me. Every day she would tell me she supported my future dreams and talked like our relationship would end in marriage.

I’m a very anxious person, and all her feelings put a lot of pressure on me, but I had been doing a lot of work on myself so I wouldn’t self-destruct like I would have in the past. During this time I felt constantly anxious and depressed, but I assumed it was just me adjusting to the relationship. I smoked more weed during this period to calm my nerves because I didn’t want to ruin what seemed like such an ideal partnership. I regret this, but I even told her later on that I loved her back, even though it felt wrong. I just didn’t want her to leave.

She’s a very logical person, while I’m more emotional. In week three, we were on a date and I asked her if she would feel sad if we broke up. She said no, and that she would learn from the experience and move on. I had already been feeling anxious that day, and her response made me completely shut down. How could she not care? I mean, I would have been heartbroken. I left our date early and texted her later about how I felt. We had a healthy conversation, and she said she would try to be more responsive to my emotions.

The next day, we didn’t text for most of the day, which was weird, but I didn’t mind. Around 7 p.m., she asked if we could go on a coffee date the next day, and I said yes. But then I found out I had caught mono and had to cancel our plans. On Thursday, I asked if we could FaceTime and just chat. Halfway through the call, she said we should break up because she felt she couldn’t give me what I needed emotionally.

I left the call immediately and found that she had already blocked me on Instagram, but not on iMessage. I was sick with the worst case of mono and bawling my eyes out. Over the week I was out of school, I tried messaging her multiple times saying that I just wanted to talk when I got better, but she completely ignored my messages and turned off read receipts. After two weeks of texting her every few days, I vented everything I felt and told her I was blocking her to move on.

I posted about the ordeal on my public Instagram story (I don’t follow many people), and two hours later her friend followed my account, saw the story, and cursed me out. I feel worse than ever and like an emotional mess. I never want to get back with her, but at the same time I’m having a hard time moving on. I don’t know if we just weren’t compatible or if she was the problem.",3,1763482894.0,LesbianActually,3,0.67,False
1p0g9uo,https://i.redd.it/pfyipi8zj12g1.jpeg,I’ve been sleeping on Aeropress like an idiot.,"I have always been a coffee drinker, but I really fell into specialty coffee over the summer. For the last six months I have been buying good beans, doing a ton of pour overs with the Hario Switch, and picking up way too many gadgets. One of those was the AeroPress with the Fellow Prismo cap, which I hardly used.

The other day I was making a shot on my Flair Classic and my wife teased me about how much coffee gear I have. She asked when I had last used the AeroPress, so the next morning I decided to actually pull it out and look up a recipe worth trying.

For some reason I always felt strange about adding water at the end. It made me think the coffee would end up weak. It surprised me that bypass actually makes the AeroPress taste much better! I’ve only ever used it to make faux “espresso shots”  
I have been using 23 grams of coffee with 50 ml of water and a paper filter in the Prismo. I let it bloom for thirty seconds, fill it to the top which is 265 ml, let it steep for two minutes, press slowly, and top it up with water to around a one to fifteen ratio (345 ml) 

The result has been seriously good. This AeroPress sat around for six months and now I am wondering why I ignored it for so long. It is definitely going back into regular rotation.
