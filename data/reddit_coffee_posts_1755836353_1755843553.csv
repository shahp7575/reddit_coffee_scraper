1mwytx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1mwytx4/hyperfocus_on_small_misfortunes/,hyperfocus on small misfortunes,"hiyaa,

I realized that often if something small goes wrong (like the coffee tasting bad, my laptop running out of battery when I'm out, missing something I need for that specific dinner I wanted to cook, ...) I have a tendency to feel like the whole day is ruined. I then tend to hyperfocus on that problem and can't do anything until it is fixed or even have meltdowns. 
I dislike this about myself. I want to change this.
I understand that this is something that makes a lot of sense from what I understand about my autism (mostly I think its the change in plans & having to adapt).
Also even when something like this happens, I can understand rationally that it really isn't a big unsolveable thing.

does anyone experience something similar? do you have any strategies for dealing with this?

thanks in advance :)

1mwytbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1mwytbc/i_filled_out_the_template/,I filled out the template!,"• How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

- I’m 19F, college sophomore. I’m filling this out for fun. 

• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

- MDD, BPD, ADHD, ASD, OCD, CPTSD  (I KNOW it looks like a 2020 nightmare but I swear I’m formally diagnosed with all of these) 

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

- I grew up Christian, but I just don’t mess with religion. It doesn’t make sense to me, it doesn’t sparkle with me. But I do like to study religions that I don’t have experience with. I am not religious myself. 

• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

- My major is Psychology. I do not want to be a therapist because I am not very good socially, but I’ve been thinking about becoming a psychiatrist. And if I did become a therapist, I’d want to specialize in DBT. Or doing research studies. Not completely figured out yet lol. 

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

- I’m a very solitary person, so I spend a lot of time alone anyways. But if I was locked in my house I would go crazy. I need something to do, like get coffee or go shopping. But not all day out - not enough energy for that. I would feel refreshed. 

• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

- I’m a cosplayer and put a lot of work into my cosplays. I don’t like sports unless I am playing them myself. And most of the time I won’t. I do enjoy working out. 

• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

- I’m very curious. I have so many ideas but no time/resources to pull them off. Most of my ideas are about perfecting my cosplays/cosplay ideas. I am also very interested in any system that explains how the brain works or how people’s personalities form. 

• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

- if it’s something I’m not scared I’ll mess up/freeze up/get overwhelmed with, sure. For example, I’d happily take a leadership role in the cosplay club, but no major roles in my sorority.  I am currently brainstorming ideas for the cosplay club, such as a TikTok to gain more traction to the club, more workshops (such as sewing, wig styling, etc), and more direct communication with scheduling. With the sorority, I would like to take more of a creative role as that’s what I’m good at. 

• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

- girl, no! I try to be, making to-do lists to keep up, but I can be forgetful. I do enjoy working on crafts and projects. 

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

- Cosplay is my art. But otherwise no. I do love music as it distracts me from life. 

• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

- I am more future oriented than past oriented, but considering mental health, the past is something I struggle with but I usually don’t focus too hard on it. It’s more of a subconscious struggle. I usually think about problems going on at the moment, but I do think a lot about future ideas. 

• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

- As long as it’s not dependency, I’ll help. I admit I’m self focused, so I don’t usually go out my way to help others. And I don’t expect others to help me. I help others because they’re close to me, or just to be nice. 

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

- I’d like if everything was consistent. I hate change. In my head, I already have everything placed where it needs to be, and I have to work everything around if something changes. 

• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

- I think of the end goal (for example, getting my degree.) If I have a good reason to be efficient and productive, I’ll do it, but I don’t like overworking myself at all :( it stresses out my brain!!! 

• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

- I don’t think so. More people have control over me, as I’m only 19 and rely on most for everything. So I’m the one being controlled. But I can be bossy sometimes. 

• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

- Too redundant to say cosplay LOL. I like thrifting because finding a good item is like finding a needle in a haystack. I love going out every single day to get coffee. I like watching TV and playing video games. I like going out partying with friends (even though it drains me for the next week). does “gardening” count as a hobby? I like these hobbies because they’re fun or calming. 

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

- I take notes to memorize info. I’m not a good auditory learner. My attention span is not good in lectures. Great visual learner though. 

• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

- I’m decent. And both. I’ve learned over time to break down projects into tasks, but I usually wing most stuff as I trust it’ll work out. 

• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

- I want to make a good amount of money so I can support myself. I want to have a career I care about, not a dead end job I hate. I want to travel. Eventually get married. 

• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

- I’m scared of becoming a 30 year old living in my mom’s basement. I’m scared of my mental illnesses ruining my life. I’m scared of being worthless. I’m scared of everyone leaving me or hating me (woah, vulnerable). I’m scared of never having a stable sense of mind or self. 

• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

- having something that I am passionate about to live for!! going outside, living like a normal? human 

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

- self destructive behaviors (excessive substance use, excessive partying, excessive sexual activity to FEEL SOMETHING!!!) isolation (to the point I completely forget how to socialize at all and have to re-teach myself to be able to walk into a walmart without freaking out). detaching from my feelings and letting them fester until they explode. or feeling ALL THE TIME, to the point it leads to me being really dramatic and sensitive (only in private though). 

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

- I do like spending time with my ideas/daydreams as they’re fun. I’m aware of my surroundings. I don’t have any issues with it - it’s a healthy amount. I pay a lot of attention to my surroundings, especially other people. I love people watching. I notice a LOT of things other people don’t, which is why I’m really good at directions. 

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

- I think about how I can get out of the room!!!! Or what I would do when I get out of the room. Think about banging my head on the wall 

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

- A LOTTTT of time. I have to think about it over and over again and what benefits me most (example: my major). I have changed my major three times. I trust myself making decisions, the other two majors were just not as interesting as I thought they would be. 

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

- Give me a day and a good car ride. But if it’s mental illness related or something extreme, it may take a while. They’re pretty important as I have to mange them day by day. 

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

- If it really goes against my morals, I will not agree with them. How much I vocalize my disagreement matters on how much power they have over me. If it’s something like facts, I will pull out the reciepts. But if they blow up over slight disagreement I’ll just keep my mouth quiet because I don’t want to be labeled as a “Well actually🤓” know-it-all.

• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

- If the rules are stupid, yes I break them. They have to make some sort of sense. But if I respect you enough, there’s no good reason to break them, or it would only hurt me to break them, then I’ll follow them.

1mwyr2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1mwyr2z/a_quantum_basketball_entropy_and_mwi/,"A quantum basketball, entropy, and MWI.","In quantum physics, I hear that while particles have a statistical distribution of indeterminate positions, when amassed into a macro object a basketball behaves as we expect because other bizarre results have vanishingly small probabilities.  
The basketball could be somewhere else, but it never is.  

In thermodynamics, I hear that while a reversal of entropy might be possible, its probability is so vanishingly small that only the most probable direction of constant increase remains in reality.  
The closed system could reverse its entropy, but it never does.  

In the many world interpretation I hear that there is a universal wave function that infinitely branches into realities, never collapsing.  
But, in that last case I do not hear ""and yet all paths but our reality are of such vanishingly small probability, and increasingly so, that  only our reality remains.  

The ball hits the hoop, the coffee and milk don't un-mix, and the only universe is the one we find ourselves in.  
&nbsp;  
And thus I ask:  
Could there be a lower limit in all matters of reality that rely on probability such as anything that falls below ceases to exist? Something like a ""minimum probability"" that fully cuts every vanishingly improbable path out of existence. Paths like the ones that reverse entropy, alter the behavior basketballs, and keep improbable universes in the MWI global wave alive?  

In other words. Could it be that entropy, macro objects behavior, and our branch of the universe are not just the immensely most probable but instead the only one, by every other option not overcoming that ""minimum probability"" threshold?",1,1755843112.0,AskPhysics,0,1.0,False
1mwyqqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mwyqqr/aitah_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_bedroom_for_my/,AITAH for refusing to give up my bedroom for my injured friend?,"I’m on a skiing holiday in NZ with a group of 6 mates and we all booked a luxury Airbnb for the trip (the group is me, my girlfriend, my mate and his girlfriend, my brother and another single friend).

On the second day, my mate’s partner had a bad crash on the slopes while attempting a green run and tore both her MCLs, rendering her wheelchair-bound for the next 6-8 weeks. It was her first time skiing which I think is negligent because I think she was overconfident - if you can’t control your skis don’t be on the slopes. 

After he got ski patrol to help them down off the mountain he went with her to hospital to get pain relief (she’s on morphine to sleep and codeine during the day) and fitted for dual knee braces before she can fly home, which meant we had to wait an extra 15 minutes at the end of the shuttle down the mountain for him to come back and pick the rest of us up to take us out to the bar. 

The next morning we got him to drive us to the shuttle again because he needed the car to take her to medical appointments that day, and then he paid for another rental car so we wouldn’t be disrupted after that. 

We went to the slopes and he says he was driving her between the physio, doctor, hospital, and pharmacy all day while managing comms with her family. He also says that during this the doctor said that she needed to stay in flat ground accommodation and needed a business class flight home because her knees can’t be bent, and she can’t fly for 5 days because of the clotting risk. 

Now here’s the kicker - on the first day, they arrived first to stock the fridge and open the house, claimed the downstairs bedroom (they left the master w/ ensuite to us as the booking was under our name - common courtesy). NOW he’s asking to swap into the master bedroom of our booking, because it’s the only room on flat ground with direct access to a toilet and we all paid equal amounts.

This might sound like a reasonable request, but since her injury, they have been acting in a very inconsiderate way:

- my mate didn’t clean up after himself when he cooked dinner on the night of the injury, leaving us to clean the kitchen for him

- he has been asking to use our ensuite to shower her and has repeatedly left the plastic chair in the shower, as well as her toothbrush and toothpaste, and even a Q tip on the coffee table

- we have come home twice to find items of her clothing on our bed from when she’s undressing to shower, and even found a knee compression sock between our unmade sheets - disgusting…

Despite all this, I’ve been cutting him slack based on their situation. I think I’ve been more than fair. 

Late last night when we got back from the bar I asked what his plans were and he said he had two options - use the master room or find alternative accommodation. But rather than snap at him, I asked to speak to him outside and set a firm boundary about their behaviour - it is mine and my partners holiday as well and they need to be more considerate. 

I took a shower and by the time I was out he had packed and taken his girlfriend to a hotel in the main city. 

He sent me a message saying that he’s disappointed and open to chat later, and that if the roles were reversed they would have insisted that we swap rooms. I think I’ve been very patient and if I were in his situation I would have left out of embarrassment, and frankly wouldn’t have been in the situation at all because I don’t take reckless chances.

Super excited — I just ordered a Lelit Anna PID as my first serious espresso machine. Now I’m looking to kit it out properly and would love some advice from people who’ve been down this road.

What I’m looking for recommendations on:

Filters: Should I get a bottomless portafilter, IMS/VST baskets, or stick with stock? Any must-have upgrades?

Grind size starting point: I’ll be dialing in with a decent grinder, but what’s a good baseline for the Anna PID? Any quirks I should know about with its 57 mm baskets?

Coffee puck screen / paper filters: Worth it for better extractions and easier cleanup, or more hype than help?

Tamping gear: Should I stick with a regular tamper, or is a calibrated/leveling tamper worth investing in?

Milk steaming accessories: Any favorite milk pitchers (size/brand) that work well with the Anna’s steam wand?

Other essentials: Knock box, WDT tool, dosing funnel, scale, water filters, cleaning kits — what are your must-haves?


Use case:

Home use, 6–10 shots daily 

Beginner but keen to learn proper technique.


Question:
What accessories & add-ons made the biggest difference for you with the Lelit Anna PID (or similar single boiler machines)? Anything you bought and later realized wasn’t worth it?

• Please do not be a conservative. I'm left-leaning/progressive and you should be too.
• Please be communicative. If we don't click, either of us should communicate that instead of ghosting. 🥴 It's perfectly cool because there is someone who will be our person, eventually.

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No kids.
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good 😏)

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie. I’m also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I’m looking for…
A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you:

Long-time follower, first-time writer here. I just want to say hello, and also apologize in advance for any grammar or spelling mistakes. I'm dyslexic and English is my second language, so I’m doing my best.

I’m a 32-year-old woman, and I have a 1-year-old daughter who was recently baptized. Baptisms are very important in my family. When I was pregnant, I told my best friend — let’s call her Helene — that I wanted her to be my daughter’s godmother. She was really excited. My family wasn’t thrilled with my choice, but they respected it.

For a little background: Helene and I had reconnected four years ago after not speaking for a long time due to an argument we had in college. We got back in touch after her brother passed away unexpectedly. I couldn’t attend the funeral, but I reached out through a mutual friend, and from there we started talking again. When she moved to California, we became very close — we talked almost every day. In fact, she called me first when she found out she was pregnant. She moved back to New York to be closer to her family. Her son is now 3 years old.

However, after I gave birth to my daughter, I started to notice that we were drifting apart again. It became one-sided — I was always the one reaching out, and when she did reply, it was often days later and very brief.

I understand she’s been going through a lot — dealing with family issues and getting her son diagnosed with autism — but still, I felt hurt and distanced. On top of that, her husband makes me very uncomfortable. He’s always cold toward me and my husband. When we’ve visited, he hasn’t greeted us and acts like we’re not even there. The few times he has spoken to us, it’s to ask personal financial questions — like how we bought our house — which feels intrusive. Once, we lent them tables and chairs for their son’s birthday. We needed them back on short notice for a funeral (my brother-in-law’s father passed away). They were kind enough to return them early that morning. We invited them upstairs for coffee and to meet our daughter, but her husband refused — even after I explained it was the first time he’d be meeting her. All he said was, “No thanks, I’ll wait in the car. Maybe next time. Sorry for your loss.” It felt cold. Helene just brushed it off, saying “that’s just how he is.” just as bad he even need early to my wedding ceremony cuz he was too tired and couldn't decide if you wanted to come or not and she ended up having to come by herself. 

That was back in winter. Now summer has come and gone, and I think we’ve spoken maybe twice in total. I was feeling pressure from my family to go ahead with the baptism. Family was flying in from the Dominican Republic, and my mom told me it was the best time to do it. So I emailed the church, and things moved quickly. At that point, I decided not to call Helene. I asked my sister to be my daughter’s godmother instead.

It wasn’t an easy decision, but Helene hadn’t made much effort to be part of my daughter’s life. She rarely asked about her, never tried to visit, and I felt like she just didn’t care. It hurt — especially because I know what it feels like to have a godmother you don’t even talk to. My mom often told me she regretted choosing a friend to be my godmother, and that stayed with me.

So I went ahead with the baptism, quickly and quietly. I work as an event planner, so most of my weekdays and weekends are fully booked, and on top of that, I’m a homemaker and take care of my elderly mom. I asked everyone not to post any pictures online until I had a chance to talk to Helene first. But my mom forgot and posted a photo on her Facebook story.

To my surprise, Helene saw it. She’s never reacted to anything I’ve posted in the past, so I was shocked that this was the one post she saw. I felt embarrassed , guilty, and I honestly didn’t know what to say to her.I apologized to her but she didn't reply. 

At the same time, I’m also hurt by how little interest she’s shown in my daughter, by how distant she’s become, and by how much I had to chase the friendship. I feel so horrible for how I handled everything. 

So… AITA for not telling her before I made my decision?",7,1755842271.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No kids.
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good 😏)

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie. I’m also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I’m looking for…
A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you: 
- Are well-groomed, carry yourself confidently 
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)

I mostly live a introverted lifestyle and dont have a social life, I go to work, go home play video games but also stay healthy by going to the gym and eating healthy, ive even started surfing (attempting), I want to meet new people and for the most part I am happy with who I am and how I live my life. 

Myself (30M) and another women (31F) met at work and started going on dates for roughly around a month but things never got to serious between us, I helped her out alot with moving (twice) and everytime she asked me to hang out i would always accept but than things started to take a turn I didnt really like.

One day she said she wanted me to start taking the lead with asking and planning dates so I did but for the most part everytime I tried she would either say no, have last minute changes with friends or leave me on read, I just though to myself maybe shes lost interest but than she would ask if I wanted to hang out again a day or 2 later. The one that sticks out the most is we were both going to be free on a friday evening so I asked her at the start of the week if she wanted to go out on than but than she left me on read and the next day sent me some random meme so I took that as a no and made plans to have a gaming night with my online friends instead, fast forward to Friday night its about 8pm and she messages me randomly and says shes bored and asks if I wanted to hang out in which I declined (the only time I declined) and said I had made other plans.

The next morning we went out for a coffee and had a deep conversation about our pasts, she explained to me she had alot of last trauma with her family and goes to therapy, I explained my background which was that I grew up in the foster care system, after telling her that she suggested that I go see therapy since I have alot of trauma and that I need to socialise more and stop living inside my bubble wasting my life playing video games and to go out and get a better paying job but also said ""but thats all up to you to make that choice, its your life so it has no effect on my life"" and after that the way she spoke to me changed.

It felt like instead of talking to me as a normal person it instead felt like she was trying to fix me despite me telling her a number of times that I dont need help with her repeating ""its up to you to make that choice its your life not mine"" as she continued to call me a traumatised person.

Eventually she spoke to me less and less and I was becoming more and more unhappy with how she was treating me with both unsuccessful attempts of asking her out on dates after she told me to ask her more and also with how she was speaking to me about trauma and therapy so I Eventually had enough and called things off between us.

I told her that I was unhappy and felt like she didnt respect or appreciate me and that I wanted to go back to just being workmates and her responce before removing me was that life doesint revolve around me and that I feel ignored because I use all my energy on work and video games and that I refuse to go get help and keeping living in my ""bubble"".

To make it clear I dont think she is a bad person by any means she a very nice person I just personally think she has a ""fix"" everything mindset which I was included in and she couldn't accept that im happy this way.

However, recently I've started feeling connected to different names like they were my own? (Millie for the past year and more recently, Jane).

As we approach 2025, stunning white barndominium designs are emerging with innovative features that cater to both aesthetics and functionality. Here, you’ll find some of the most exciting trends and ideas that will make your barndominium stand out.

### Spacious Open Floor Plans

One of the defining features of modern barndominiums is their open floor plans. These designs create a sense of space and flow that homebuyers are drawn to. Imagine walking into a vast living area that seamlessly connects to the kitchen and dining spaces. This layout not only enhances your lifestyle but also offers versatility for entertaining guests or spending quality time with family.

### Energy Efficiency

In 2025, sustainability is more than just a trend; it’s a necessity. Many stunning white barndominium designs incorporate energy-efficient features that minimize environmental impact and lower utility bills. This includes:

- **Solar Panels:** Harnessing the sun’s energy can remarkably reduce electricity costs.
- **High-Quality Insulation:** Keeping your home warm in winter and cool in summer helps maintain comfort with less energy use.
- **Energy-Efficient Windows:** These allow natural light while keeping heating and cooling efficient.

### Smart Home Technology

- **Smart Thermostats:** Control your home’s temperature remotely for ultimate comfort.
- **Smart Security Systems:** Enhance safety with 24/7 monitoring and alerts sent straight to your phone.
- **Smart Lighting:** Adjust lighting settings based on your preferences or schedule.

### Modern Farmhouse Aesthetics

While the exterior of white barndominiums often features classic barn-style elements, 2025 designs are pushing the boundaries of modern farmhouse aesthetics. Expect to see:

- **Contrasting Colors:** Black or gray accents against the pristine white façade create bold visual appeal.

Whether you’re seeking a peaceful retreat or a stylish family home, embracing these elements will help you create a stunning space that stands the test of time.

The Benefits of Choosing White Barndominiums for Modern Living
--------------------------------------------------------------

White barndominiums have become a popular choice for modern living space in recent years. With their unique blend of functionality and charm, they offer a range of benefits that cater to both families and individuals. If you're considering a barndominium, here are some compelling reasons to choose white designs.

### Aesthetic Appeal

The crisp, clean look of white barndominiums creates a stunning visual impact. This color evokes a sense of fresh air and brightening spaces. Whether set against lush greenery or a serene countryside backdrop, white structures stand out beautifully. Their minimalist charm complements various architectural styles, making them versatile for personal taste.

### Spacious Atmosphere

One of the primary benefits of a white color scheme is its ability to make spaces feel larger. White walls and ceilings reflect light, enhancing the open feel of the area. This quality is particularly beneficial in barndominiums, which often feature spacious layouts. You can create a cozy yet expansive atmosphere that invites relaxation and comfort.

#### Natural Light Enhancements

White surfaces amplify the arrival of natural light. With expansive windows dominating the design of most barndominiums, the light filters through beautifully, creating bright, airy interiors. This not only improves the ambiance but can also reduce the need for artificial lighting during the day, making your living space more energy-efficient.

### Energy Efficiency

White barndominiums can be energy efficient due to their reflective nature. By utilizing materials that reflect sunlight, these homes keep cooler in hotter months. This can lead to lower energy bills and a reduced ecological footprint. Pair this with modern insulation materials, and you'd have a home that is not only stunning but also sustainable.

#### Cost-Effective Build

The fundamentals of constructing a barndominium lend themselves to cost-effectiveness. Constructing with steel or metal frames often results in reduced labor and material costs compared to traditional homes. Choosing a simple white design can further lower costs, as it requires less intricate decorating, thus saving both time and money.

### Personalization Opportunities

While white barndominiums have a classic look, they also provide an excellent canvas for personalization. The neutral backdrop allows for easy incorporation of colorful furnishings, artwork, or landscaping, which can reflect your style.

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1mu8v54/update_my_mom_said_my_wedding_was_just_okay_at_my/) **- 19th August 2025**



**My mom said my wedding was “just okay” at my twin’s wedding — and she still doesn’t know she’s no longer welcome in our home.**



I (27F) got married in Oct 2024 to my now-husband (28M), a military reservist. We had a small mountain wedding after surviving a long deployment, and it was everything we hoped for.

Leading up to it, my mom (61F) emotionally blew up on us — crying, saying we didn’t include her, and even told my husband he ruined our relationship. She apologized to me, but never to him like she promised. Still, we let her come. She even brought her sister (not invited) and I didn’t have the energy to say no.

Fast forward to my twin sister’s destination wedding this spring (I was the maid of honor). My mom was drinking, and at the rehearsal dinner, she told my sister (in front of my husband), “Their wedding was okay… but this is beautiful.” He didn’t tell me until later that night because he didn’t want to ruin the day. That comment crushed him.

When we got home, we made the hard decision: she’s no longer welcome to stay in our home. That was in April. It’s now July. She has no idea.

Since then, we’ve only had vague phone calls, and now she’s saying she wants to come visit “to change up her scenery.” She can’t drive anymore, so if she visits, she’d be fully dependent on us to get around and would definitely expect to stay with us.

I’m frozen. I don’t know how to say, “you can come to dinner, but you’re not staying here.”

I feel like I’ve been protecting everyone else’s feelings for years while mine get ignored. I love her, but I’m drained. Has anyone ever had to say something like this to a parent? How do you set this kind of boundary without feeling like a terrible daughter?

*Boundaries only matter if you're willing to enforce them. She treated your husband like crap, refused to apologize, and insults you both when she thinks you're not listening. At some point, you need to decide, are your mom's feelings more valid and important than your husband's? Are they more important than yours? If you keep putting your mom first, your husband is going to realize that when push comes to shove, you bend over.*

**Update - 1 month later**



Hi again — I originally posted about the long-standing tension with my mom, her hurtful comments toward my husband, and my struggle with whether to let her visit. Here’s the latest.

Quick recap for context:

•	My husband (28M) and I (27F) started dating in 2021, engaged in Dec 2023, married Oct 2024.

•	My relationship with my mom (61F) has been complicated for years due to her alcoholism, volatility, and lack of accountability.

•	She was minimally supportive during our wedding planning and made choices that hurt me.

•	At my twin sister’s destination wedding this year, my mom made multiple passive-aggressive comments — including telling my sister that her wedding was “so much better” than mine. My husband heard it, I didn’t.

•	After the trip, my husband and I agreed she would no longer be welcome to stay in our home. Since April, we’ve had very limited contact. The recent conversation:

I finally called my mom to talk about it. She immediately denied saying anything hurtful and essentially called my husband a liar. We went back and forth, and she eventually agreed to call and apologize to him directly. She asked for his work schedule, I gave it to her, and she said she’d call.

Then, instead of following through, she texted saying she wanted a three-way call instead — reframing the situation as a “misunderstanding” or “relay of communication.” I told her clearly this wasn’t about miscommunication — it was about words that were said and how they made us feel. What we needed first was ownership and an apology.

Her reply was that she’s “been accused of speaking without thinking” and now wants to talk with her sister (my aunt) before speaking with us again. She said she’ll let us know when she’s ready.

The unexpected twist:

The day after my mom said she wanted to talk with my aunt before speaking to us again, my aunt texted me out of the blue:

“Call me when you have a minute to talk. No one knows I am reaching out to you so please don’t mention it.”

I called her, and we had an incredibly validating conversation. She’s been through almost the exact same dynamic with their mom and with my mom — constant comparisons, disapproval of her spouse, judgment about her life choices. She told me my mom has never taken genuine accountability or given a real apology, and likely never will. She encouraged me to stop chasing approval, keep my focus on my marriage, and keep any interactions with my mom surface-level and drama-free.

Later in the call, I told her that my mom had said she wanted to speak with her before reaching out to us again. The very next morning, my aunt texted me:

“Your mom talked to me when we were having coffee this morning. I will call you later today to let you know what we discussed. I didn’t tell her that you and I talked yesterday nor did I start the conversation — she did.”

When she called later, she gave my husband the lowdown on what we’d discussed the day before and shared what my mom had said. At one point, my mom apparently asked my aunt if she should apologize to us — and my aunt told her no, because she believed it wouldn’t be genuine anyway.

Where Things Stand Now:

Despite my aunt’s advice, my mom still texted both my husband and me in a group chat asking when my husband had time this week to talk—after putting us off with excuses multiple times. At that point, my husband (28M) was fully done. He doesn’t want to keep going in circles, and I don’t blame him.

For me, it’s sad to accept that my mom may never be the type to take real accountability or give a genuine apology. I know it’s going to take me some time to heal and move forward, but I also know that low contact (at least for now) is best for my mental health and for my marriage.

I’ll be focusing on my life with my husband, keeping boundaries in place, and leaning on my aunt and of course my husband for support when I need it. If anything changes, I’ll update again.

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me through this—it’s been hard, but I finally feel like I’m putting us first.

**froggylove78**

*Hugs. One thing I have learned both through therapy and Reddit groups is that chasing my mom for a change just stressed me out.*

*The minute I learned to say: she was the best mother she could be vs. She is a good mother to me or that I needed, did my thinking change. You need to work in that she loves you, but she doesn't know what you need and quite possibly can't give it to you. She will not change, but you don't need to change either. Your expectations need to change.*

**PuffTingle**

*Exactly this. OP, it sounds like you’ve done everything you could to try to bridge the gap, but real accountability has to come from her. Protecting your peace and marriage is the healthiest choice you can make right now.*

**Jesusisaraisin55**

*I'm husband to a wife that was abused by pretty much everyone in her life before I came along, especially her mother.*

*My wife tried to have a relationship with her mother. It was one sided, and caused her nothing but pain. I always encouraged her to have as much or as little to do with them as she felt comfortable, knowing that nothing good would ever come from it.*

*Until the day her bio-grandfather died. She called just to talk, and her aunt answered the phone and said some completely vile things. That's when I stepped in. I called and made it very clear that there would be no more contact. She was to never contact my wife again. I made no threats, nor would I, but their relationship was over.*

*That's been about five years. My wife's mental and physical health has improved tremendously. It's not only because her mother is no longer in her life, but it plays a huge role.*

*Your mother will never change. Your relationship will never improve. Narcissists gonna narc.*

1mwy3zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mwy3zl/dating_sober_the_good_the_awkward_and_the/,"Dating Sober: The Good, the Awkward, and the Surprisingly Fun","So I started dating again recently… sober. And let me tell you, it’s a whole different ballgame. For years I thought grabbing drinks was the only way to date. Like, how else do you loosen up, right? First date = bar. Second date = another bar. Third date = shots if it’s going well. That was just the script in my head.

Now? I’m pulling up to first dates with no liquid courage in me and holy hell, it’s both terrifying and kinda amazing. The awkward part is real. Sitting across from someone with nothing but water or coffee in hand, you suddenly realize how much silence actually exists. There’s no buzz to blur the edges, no fake confidence to hide behind. Just you, raw, present. At first, I legit thought I was bombing dates left and right because I wasn’t being “fun drunk me.”

But here’s the twist sober dating is way more honest. Like, you actually find out if you vibe with the person instead of just vibing with the alcohol. Conversations go deeper. You remember what the other person said. You don’t wake up the next morning trying to piece together “did I say something dumb?” or “how many drinks did I even have?” And the best part? You end the night knowing exactly how you feel instead of confusing attraction with a buzz.

The surprisingly fun part is the creativity. Without bars as the default, I’ve ended up on coffee shop crawls, late-night walks, museum dates, random goofy stuff that would’ve never crossed my mind before. And it turns out… that’s way more fun than just sitting on a bar stool yelling over loud music.

Not saying it’s all smooth sailing yeah, some people definitely look at you sideways when you say you don’t drink. And sometimes I still miss that quick little confidence shot a beer gave me. But overall, dating sober has been more real, more memorable, and honestly, way more fulfilling.

Anyone else out here dating sober? How’s it been for you more good, more awkward, or more fun?",6,1755840820.0,stopdrinking,2,0.88,False

1mwy1fb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mwy1fb,2000 Watt inverter install in the Y,"Ever since installing a fridge in the back of our Y we have always wanted a way to cook (electric) when camping off grid. The problem is high power inverters required for cooking/ high current use have some big capacitors inside. Just plugging one in will trip the short circuit protection in the PCS. You also need a substantial direct high current source. I did a direct to 12v PCS connection and built a current protected pre-charge to fix the trip protection issue. The wire runs right next to the charging tubes under the trim plastics. I also installed a QS8 plug (Lays in the cubby) for anything else that requires high current 12v. Its great for charging RC stuff for the kids. I figured I would share photos of my install. I will be covering the connections with a fireproof plastic cover when it arrives. Pretty clean out of the way install that works well for us. Happy we can now have full power no matter where we go. 

We have tested an induction cooktop/cast iron pan, small microwave, air frier and a coffee pot. All work great. Please note, my car is a 2021 Model Y Performance. This was before Tesla upped the voltage for AMD. The inverter I am using has a 16.5 VDC overvolt protection so it may still work in those cars but has not been tested. If you choose to perform this installation, you do so at your own risk. There is always a risk of shock, fire and or damaging things which are normally expensive. If you are not confident in electrical work I would suggest sitting this one out. Also I am sure Tesla would have a fit if you needed warranty work done. You have been warned! :)  For me its working great and not only has my warranty expired I have also swapped in a new HV pack already myself (wanted new car range). So I am free to mod as I see fit. \*\*\*Freedom... woohoo!\*\*\* Please note. If you do short your PCS (12 volt from the HV pack) you will need to disconnect the fireman's loop (under the hood) or x098 connector (under the rear seat) as well as the 12v battery (under the hood) to reset the power system. I have been able to pull a full 2000 watts without upsetting the car with this configuration. For those wondering about a fuse it is not necessary due to current and short circuit protection already built into the PCS itself. The wire used is more than capable of handling the current the PCS can provide before tripping. 

I do have a plan for a V2 system that will actually be building myself. It will be running directly off the HV pack (400v) that will supply 5kw of 110v or 220v (switchable). This system will weigh much less, output more power with zero loss of cabin space, no fan noise and zero strain on the PCS of the car. More to come on that. (I might even offer a kit down the road)

I start to walk to the first line where there's a couple putting their items on the conveyor belt, but I guess the guy working the lane must have been going on break or something because he told them that he was actually in the process of closing the lane down. The couple started putting their things back in their cart and I went to the next open line. They ended up behind me in line not too long afterwards. I didn't pay much attention to my surroundings because I was putting my shit on the conveyor belt.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor).

1mwxxw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mwxxw0/how_to_avoid_a_fight_with_my_32f_husband_35m_this/,How to avoid a fight with my (32F) husband (35M) this weekend ?,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years, and have two kids (3F and a 5 months-old) and a dog. My baby is not sleeping well these days and wakes up 5-7 times per night. It is tough, I am tired but honestly OK, i know it is a transition period. 
My husband is sweet and supportive. But sometimes, I feel like he does not HEAR me when I ask for help. Each time I try to discuss an issue, he tells me about how it makes him feel (by playing victim and not taking responsability) without trying to understand my perspective or by suggesting I am too sensitive (e.g., « you make a big fuss over nothing », « it is nothing », « it is not a big deal »). I already mentionned it to him but there is no point discussing it further, he made fun of me when I told him. I want to be clear that we love each other and he is a fantastic parent. Now there is a clear communication issue between us - I do not feel understood and am too agressive, and he feels attacked and he is immature (he cannot apologize, and struggles to be held accountable for his own mistakes - but that is a defense mechanism that he developed during his very difficult childhood). He does not want us to see someone to help us communicate better. This is to set the scene.

This week, we were supposed to go abroad with the kids during our holidays to visit daycare and search for a house because I found my dream job in another country. We had a difficult week so last minute we decided it would be easier for me to stay home with both kids and for him to go abroad (8h by car forth, 8h back in a country we had already lived )alone. We are used to travel, and of course, without the kids it is much faster (and quieter haha), but it is still tiring. Important point: our second car is broken so I cannot move much with the kids. 
He left at 6AM on Monday, I started feeling sick. Fine whatever it happens. Woke up to tell him bye bye - both kids got up as well. The day goes by. Tuesday I am much worse, find a doctor to whom I can go to by foot. She tells me I need to rest however I can. I ask my brother and mother for help but they are not available. Totally fine, it happens, they actually have nice things planned - and my mother offers to come by the next evening (she lives 1h drive away - thanks mom !!!). Now overnight, my neighbours’s car caught fire. A big fire, 5m away from my room where I was sleeping with the kids. Long story short : explosion sounds woke me up, I took everyone out as fast as possible. The dog ran away as soon as I opened the front door. 1AM morning, a neighboor helped me find him back with both kids in their strollers in the forest. Firemen managed to contain the fire and we all thank a 70 yo badass neighbour who watered the car and bushes around, because things would have apparently got ugly very fast otherwise. I am allowed to go back home, manage to put the kids back to sleep, cuddle my sweet doggie doo. At that point, I am scared that the fire starts back and cannot go back to sleep. Well I know it is me not being rationale and no one ´s fault. I cannot go anywhere else anyway, I do not have a car, cannot contact husband who is sleeping. Next day, he asks me if he should go home earlier and I say no, I ll manage. 
My mum arrives the next evening, she is tired (she is chronically tired, it is something to understand and accept) and cannot help much but we are happy to see her. The next morning she feels better and helps me a lot - she cleans the house and does some grocery shopping for me. After lunch she is tired and wants to go back to her home. At that point, I have developed a huge cold sore (disgusting I know) and started my period. I send a message to my husband to tell him to please come back asap now (this is now Thursday). I am tired now. On his way back from the foreign country on Thursday, he stopped for the night at his brother’s place. He has good reasons to do it and it was planned from the start. Now he told me he will leave at 8AM on Friday and it is a 6hours drive (without the breaks) to go back home. I am very disappointed, I was hoping much earlier. I have to go back to the doctor today (Friday) because my disease (angina) has not gone at all and the pain still wakes me up at night (or is it the baby and I cannot go back to sleep because of the pain? I don’t know) - it evolves weirdly. 
Well I have to go back to the doctor by foot with both kids, it takes some Time, I do not feel good and I am terrified to contaminate them with my cold sore (I ll have to take one kid in the baby carrier, one in the stroller).
I have barely slept over the past 4 days. I told my husband to please leave even earlier in the morning - 7 if he could. I doubt that he will do it. 
I know that when he will arrive he will need a break from the road to take a cigarette, coffee, toilets and he will take his sweet Time and I will be overwhelmed with anger. I will make a sharp comment at some point and the fight will be on. 
He will say that he is tired too and that life is not a competition about who is the most tired and I Will have to do everything in my power to not yell at him. By text, he told me that « he would give me my Friday evening off I deserve it ». I know he wanted to be kind but fuck I feel like I deserve much more, and I NEED to sleep this is not about WANT. He will be tired from the road and the visits he made. But he was at a friends’house, had nice parties, slept through the nights. I wont be in a place where I can tolerate his BS. Please give me advice on how to manage my anger, and please give me a reality check if my feelings are not valid. We both go back to work on Monday.

[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. [It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, [it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as [it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for [at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. [Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma) avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, [the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/) may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is [a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/) if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, [your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine [it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called [an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/) that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be [subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The [drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C) for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically [to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in [either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait [at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating) before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating [to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil) on the needle site [for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having [decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are [particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/) found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, [you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor) and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation [is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Instead of stars or generic reviews, it’s all about your actual favorite orders — and especially sharing them with friends.

Here’s the thought:
	•	Imagine you’re grabbing takeout for a friend, and you already know their go-to order because it’s saved on their MyOrdr profile.
	•	Or you’re at a new spot and can instantly see what your best friend (or even a local foodie) swears by.
	•	No more “What do you want?” texts — it’s already there, waiting.

The feed isn’t just pictures of food; it’s a social list of your crew’s actual orders. You can:
	•	Save your friends’ favs so you never forget
	•	Show off your own “signature order”
	•	Discover hidden gems through what real people you trust actually eat

It’s like having a cheat sheet for making sure your friend always gets their perfect drink, pizza, burger, or coffee order.

👉 What features would make it fun and practical?

He escapes the psych ward and they go on some adventure involving the girl's family. The whole thing was an indie romcom kinda dark and awkward especially cause of the age gap. I remember about 3 specific scenes:

1. The emo girl and the patient initially meet where he is enclosed in a fence which encompasses the psych ward.
2. They meet again in a coffee shop sometime later
3. They spend a night in a hotel where the psych ward patient sneaks out and hooks up with the lobby girl and the emo girl is NOT happy

I posted this months ago but didn't get any satisfactory answers

I just remembered another thing, I found the movie on HBO (most likely) or another streaming service by going to sort movies by alphabetical order and the movie appeared likely nearing the top meaning it probably starts with a number, a, b, or c. This is theoretical though.

I found my boyfriend’s secret account right as he posted asking for romantic getaway ideas. 

so I played along-anonymous comment, suggested this charming little town I’d been dying to visit. 

One minutes later, he replied: 

Thanks, but me and my girl already did that place this Valentine’s Day.\] 

literally choked on my coffee. 

lis GIRL? 

unny thing is, I spent that Valentine’s Day alone because he was “too busy with work.” 

urns out his work had a name: MY GIRL. 

ly finger froze. 

tapped on this sketchy profile with the jumbled number username to scroll through his timeline. 

he account holder didn’t post much, but every single thing was proof positive that this was my boyfriend 

ixon Reed. 

he custom watch I’d gotten him, that weird succulent on his desk, the shot of my hand wearing our nniversary ring from our five-year milestone… 

steadied myself and looked back at that reply. 

My girl.J 

was two years older than Jaxon-he’d never called me his “girl.” 

And Valentine’s Day… 

This past Valentine’s Day, he’d been on some business trip with his team, too swamped to even call. 

I calmly shot a message to my assistant, asking her to pull together a list of everyone from the tech department who’d been traveling on Valentine’s Day. 

Three minutes later, I had my answer.

Oops! M ick You Money Just Torpedoed Your “Nepo Baby Hustle!

Chapter 1 

Bella Sterling. The only female intern on that trip, a fresh college grad-a young “girl” barely out of school. 

Of course it was her. 

Then I remembered last night, when I’d mentioned taking some time off next week for a little getaway. 

His big project was wrapping up, set to finish this week, and next week would be his most chill period in 

nonths. 

ut before I could even finish talking, he looked up from his computer screen and said flatly: 

Next week I’ve got another business trip lined up. No time.” 

You wanna go somewhere? Take Harper or one of your other friends.” 

ix years together, and this was the first time he’d blown off spending vacation days with me. 

ver since we’d been working at the same company, we’d always synced our time off. 

ight up until I found his secret account and saw that post, I was still holding onto some dumb hope that 

aybe he was planning to surprise me. 

Director Blackwell, Vice President Reed submitted his vacation request three days ago,” the HR rep told me. 

Others taking time off next week include the Deputy Director from Operations, someone from Legal, and…. ella Sterling from Tech, taking a week of sick leave.” 

smiled grimly 

unny how everyone got weird and hesitant when they mentioned Bella. 

he day she started, word had already spread through half the company that she was the CEO’s niece. veryone figured she was just some rich girl padding her resume. 

inly jaxon had put on this whole act about being fair and impartial when he talked to me about her. 

She’s just an intern like any other. Makes no difference to me 

But this past year, his special treatment of her had become possible to ignore. 

He’d wear belle’s inte braided buscadet right aveat to the watch I gave him, saying she’d gotten it blessed at her church and he just wanted the god hack cheres 

He’d display the stuffed animal she gave him front and center on bla desk, saying everyone in the department got one and he didn’t want people thinking he was singling her out 

Chapter 1 

He forgot our anniversary for the first time ever, but somehow remembered that tomorrow marked Bella’s hundred-day work milestone and had already booked reservations at her favorite restaurant. 

Every time I brought any of this up, he’d tell me I was being paranoid. 

“Look, given who she’s connected to, showing her a little extra consideration isn’t exactly unreasonable.” 

“It’s just office politics, you know? You’re a director-you get how this stuff works.” 

I understood all too well, which is why I kept letting it slide, right up until today and this ironclad “evidence 

If before I’d just sensed his heart drifting away from me, now I could finally put an end to this whole mess. 

I sat in my office all afternoon like a zombie before heading home to wait for Jaxon to finish his overtime. 

“I saw your vacation request at HR.” I was sprawled in my chair when I heard him walk through the door, his footsteps stuttering behind me. 

“You’re investigating me now? That’s my private business.” His voice carried a sharp edge of irritation. 

“Is it?” I didn’t bother looking up. 

“Does 

your private business include your ‘girl’ too?”

1mwxm2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheraSeven/comments/1mwxm2w/why_you_should_never_accept_a_coffee_date/,Why you should never accept a coffee date,"Ladies,
The endless ""coffee date"" debate is a perfect example of how men test our standards. My perspective is simple: dating is the vetting process for marriage. A date is a man's opportunity to prove he is worthy of my time and consideration for the role of husband.
When I was dating my now-fiancé, he understood the assignment. He wanted to treat me to coffee, so he sent me $25 gift cards for places like Starbucks or Chick-fil-A. A $25 gift card was enough for a few things: I could get myself a coffee a few times during the week, grab a couple of items in one trip, or even take a few friends out with me.
It was a gift, not a date. It was a low-pressure gesture that demonstrated his provider mindset and desire to contribute to my happiness, without demanding my time in exchange for his bare-minimum effort. He passed this initial test.
Our actual dates were where the real vetting took place. Each place we went held a different purpose, showing me why he would make a good husband:
 * Restaurant Dinners: This was his chance to show his generosity and willingness to provide. I could observe how he handled himself in a traditional courtship setting and see his provider instincts in action.
 * Movies: This was a test of his temperament. He bought the overpriced concession food without a single complaint, showing that he prioritized my enjoyment of the experience and wasn't petty or cheap over small luxuries.
 * The Mall: This was about vetting his ability to be a supportive partner. We’d walk and talk for hours while I shopped. He was there to invest his time and attention in my world, proving he could be present and engaged without needing to be the center of attention.


This leads to the framework I used, which I call The Iced Drink Theory.
Think of a man's initial dating effort as a perfectly made drink with ice. It's the full-strength, best-case scenario. It's him on his best behavior, trying to win you over.
But in any long-term relationship, the ice eventually melts. The initial intensity fades into comfortable, everyday life. The drink naturally gets a little watered down. This is inevitable.
So, the fundamental question you must ask while vetting is: Will this drink still be good once the ice has melted?
If he starts with a low-effort, lukewarm coffee, the watered-down version will be sludge. You will be left with nothing. But if he starts with a top-shelf, full-flavored drink, the slightly ""melted"" version will still be delightful and acceptable for a lifetime.
This isn't about being ""high-maintenance""; it's about being high-standard. You are observing his peak effort to predict his average performance. If his absolute best is a $5 coffee, what will his daily effort look like in five years? Don't stick around to find out.
Demand a man whose best effort is so impressive that his everyday effort will keep you happy for the rest of your life.",5,1755839094.0,SheraSeven,3,1.0,False
1mwxlcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mwxlcq/finding_myself_as_a_sahw_battling_loneliness_and/,"Finding myself as a SAHW, battling loneliness and looking for passion.","My husband and I are both 30. We got married at 27, and about nine months into our marriage, he earned a top position in a company. Since then, he’s away three weeks out of every four, and I only get to spend one full week with him at home.

In the beginning, I tried traveling with him, but I quickly realized it made me feel even more purposeless — I was out of my routine and still alone, since his work kept him busy until late. He’s incredibly passionate and driven, and even when he’s not physically at work, his mind is occupied by it. Because of the nature of his job, people call him constantly. I went from having his full attention to having to wait for a specific window of time each week just to talk to him properly.

I’m truly grateful for how hard he works and the comfortable life we have, but that’s the reality of being married to someone successful: it can be very lonely. During our first year, I struggled with separation anxiety and depression. Over time, I had no choice but to sit with my feelings and eventually grew through them. Now, things that used to feel painful — like sitting alone at coffee shops — don’t bother me anymore. It’s strange how normal it now feels to see him busy and not have that constant intense connection we once had.

In the beginning, I resisted this new normal. I didn’t want to accept that our marriage looked so different than it did before. To make it harder, we had moved to a new city to start our life together, so I didn’t have family or friends nearby. Making adult friendships is difficult, especially when most people are busy with their kids. On top of all this, I’ve gone through three miscarriages. So I can’t start a family yet. 

Now I find myself with a lot of free time, but I don’t know how to fill it in a way that doesn’t leave me feeling bitter or resentful as a stay-at-home wife. I’ve had heart-to-heart conversations with my husband about how this has impacted me mentally, but they often turn heavy and depressing. I want him to see that I’ve grown too — I want him to see me happy, that I have my own life and identity. I don’t want pity; I want to flourish for myself.

A little about me: a regular day job isn’t possible right now. I’d like to finish university, but I can’t enroll full-time. I want to start a business, but fear and introversion sometimes hold me back. I imagine myself as someone with many hobbies, but I’m still working on overcoming my craving for instant gratification. I tend to loose interest fast if I’m not immediately good at it or if it requires alot of effort haha I’ve taken up painting, which I enjoy, but sometimes I feel too lazy to even take out my supplies and begin.

That’s where I am right now — trying to figure out how to create a fulfilling life for myself alongside my marriage. I’d love to hear your perspective.

hi everyone. i’m (22) kinda freaked out by what happened today. i’m on my second day of my period and woke up with the most unbearable cramps. consistent and a little nauseating. so i took two midol as recommended on the bottom around 12ish. around 2ish, i was sitting on the couch and suddenly felt disoriented, had an out of body feeling, noticing my heart was beating harder and loud, and a little shaky. it was very scary. the feeling is similar to greening out of weed in a since where i had to manually do everything. i havent smoked in over 8 years, but its the closest similarity i can relate it too. the worst part of it all was the anxiety. i don’t really great anxiety will that but this was very overwhelming and a little panicky. it felt like everything was just heightened. I don’t normally drink coffee or caffeine in general so i’m assuming it’s the caffeine in the medication but i didn’t experience this the last time i took midol. these effects lasted for a solid 45 minutes and for the rest of the day, i felt the side effects slowly wear out. the midol didnt even help with the cramps at all. after a few hours, i still feel anxiety, not as much but there. I was about to go to sleep but suddenly felt anxious and a little of of body kinda thing. i’m a bit confused because i thought the midol would be out of my system by now. i’m desperate to look for some answers or if anyone else had this experience. honestly just scared and afraid this will happen again if it’s not related to midol. my plan is to make a doctors appointment and hope for the best",1,1755838748.0,Periods,0,1.0,False

Just happened to me. Was reviewing some contracts when this character started whispering plot twists in my head. After 32 years in admin and legal work, you'd think I'd be used to my brain doing this by now.

Honestly, the best stories come from the weirdest places. That romance novel I'm working on? Started because I overheard two people arguing about coffee orders at Starbucks. The mystery series? Inspired by all the office politics I've witnessed over the decades.

Sometimes I wonder if my colleagues knew I was secretly collecting material for books every time they told me their drama 😅

Anyone else here living a double life? Corporate by day, creative by night? Would love to know what random moment sparked your latest project.

# The Strange Sound in the Study Room

On a quiet Sunday, Arjun tapped his bookshelf to slide a novel out — but instead of a solid thud, he heard a faint, hollow echo. The shelf, once sturdy and proud, felt oddly light. A gentle push crumbled a corner into powdery fragments. What Arjun didn’t know was that termites had been working silently behind the polished surface for months, stripping the wood grain by grain. Unlike other pests, termites don’t make noise or leave obvious messes; their devastation is discovered only when the structure has already been weakened.

[*why termites come out after rain*](https://www.rentokil-pestcontrolindia.com/blog/termites/why-do-termites-come-out-when-it-rains--expert-insights-by-rentokil-pci)

# Why Hollow Wood is More Than Cosmetic Damage

A hollow door or shelf might seem like a small issue, but it’s often a symptom of deeper infestation. Termites don’t stop at a single plank; they expand in networks, carving tunnels that compromise entire frameworks. According to the U.S. Forest Service, termite colonies can consume wood at a rate of 2–3 feet per year. Left unnoticed, this silent demolition can extend from furniture to support beams.

# Furniture: The Hidden Feast

Most homeowners protect foundations but ignore furniture. Coffee tables, wardrobes, and even picture frames often serve as the first targets. These items usually rest on damp floors or in corners with poor ventilation — perfect for termites to launch their work. By the time you see bubbling paint or sagging wood, the interior is often already consumed.

# Termites Don’t Just Eat – They Weaken Safety

Beyond financial loss, hollow wood poses safety risks. In 2021, an Australian housing authority reported multiple cases where weakened staircases collapsed, all traced back to termite damage. Furniture failures can lead to injuries, especially when children are involved.

# The Emotional Toll of “Silent Loss”

Arjun’s bookshelf wasn’t just furniture; it held his late grandfather’s first editions. Losing it meant losing a piece of family history. That’s why termite damage often feels heavier than its repair cost. It strips away not only wood but also memories and trust in the safety of one’s home.

# The Takeaway

If wood sounds hollow or crumbles easily, don’t dismiss it as aging. It may be the quiet warning of a much bigger problem. A single damaged bookshelf can be the first sign of termites mapping your home from the inside out.",1,1755837944.0,u_RentokilPCI,0,1.0,False
1mwx8o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/1mwx8o7/strange_episode_in_fov_test_seizure_or_panic/,Strange Episode in FOV Test- seizure or panic?,"I started my journey in 2023. Today I had my fourth recheck in Neuro-Opthalmology with my new doctor today. I really wasn't fond of my old one, who was insistent that losing weight was the literal cure to this condition. I got lucky she retired to Florida ... First, the good news! The Topamax is working at MY pace and the benefits are outweighing the side effects *so far*. I'm taking it only once per day, so half the dose they prescribed, and my new doctor is on board with it because it's reduced my pressures and optic nerve swelling. No repeat LP obviously but for reference, I was diagnosed with a pressure of 32 mmH2O last year. I've got some things to discuss with my PCP on Monday to rule out other symptoms being caused by other conditions. If we rule out other conditions then we may have a recheck at Topamax causing my extreme exhaustion problems. 

Onto today's serious concern... I've had my field of vision tested before and it went really well so I had no reason to expect today would be any different. It's an easy test. I was a little nervous to meet the new doc but I came well prepared with a journal of my symptoms and things I wanted to discuss! I didn't actually know the field of vision test was happening today but I was cool with it. The tech performing it is really cool, friendly, overall a fun person.

My right eye test went super well. The left eye goes and we're like 3/4 of the way through and most of the time I find it hard to focus on the orange dot. My eye is tired and flicking back and forth (L-R) a lot which it does pretty often. All of a sudden, I stop seeing the blinking lights. It feels like time stops, and the big white field shifts to black. The white lights that make up the little diamond shape invert in color too, so everything is basically reversed. I sit there for a little while longer just kinda trying to process it? Figure out what's going on and see if I can focus long enough to push it through. I'm not pushing buttons, I'm not thinking of anything except ""the field is black. Stare at the orange dot. Why is the field black?"" I ask the tech if we can take a break for a second. She says yeah of course so I push my chair away and the second I do, I can feel my heart is literally RACING. It's probably close to 170+BPM, extremely uncomfortable. There's tears running down my face and then my vision goes back to normal. It felt like I didn't know how long it had been, and like I had been sitting there for a long time staring at that orange dot. But I think it has literally only been seconds. I'm shaking, and tell her I don't understand what happened but explained what I was feeling. After about a minute or two, my heart rate returned to normal and I finished the test. I was able to complete the rest of my appointment with zero issues or anxiety at ALL. There was no anxiety prior to the FOV exam, nor was there any anxiety even after the event happened. I mean, aside from wondering WTF happened. The nurse so kindly got me a cold wet washcloth for my neck though and made sure I felt alright to finish the test before sending me back to my room. 

At the time I said to her maybe it was a panic attack because I didn't want to sound CRAZY saying maybe it was a fucking seizure. I understand photosensitive seizures are actually pretty rare, I've never had a seizure in my life, dunno what it would feel like or how somebody would react if it was one so maybe it's wildly off base. I'm just wondering if anybody else has experienced an odd reaction to a standard field of vision test, whether that's a spacey feeling or just felt like they needed a break, or if they can offer some insight into what might have happened.. I'm perfectly willing to accept ""yeah it was totally a panic attack"" at this point too, I just know I've felt increasingly exhausted as the day has gone on and I crawled into bed at 7pm pretty happily. 

Since it IS relevant, and there is a history, I've had two true panic attacks in my life. the last one was about 7 years ago. It was untriggered (waiting in line at a coffee shop when my heart rate skyrocketed suddenly. Then I freaked out about that, and made it worse) but lasted hours and landed me in the ER on an EKG. The one before that was nearly a decade ago now and was after a period of severe physical abuse I endured and have thankfully been able to move well past. It should've landed me in the ER but had severe carpopedal spasms and was essentially paralyzed for the entire night. I see a therapist on a weekly basis and am on medication to regulate my hormone levels overall, so my emotional state IS (mostly) regulated. The Topamax, in theory, is an anti epileptic and shouldn't be able to allow me to have seizures .. ",1,1755837872.0,iih,0,1.0,False

Love deeply and without the need to possess or own; let beautiful connections pass through you without attachment, slam your heart into the people and the places and the things that ignite something deep inside of your soul, and I promise, I promise -

the right things will stay. You will never lose what is for you. Please don't ever forget that.”
(A gentle reminder p. 42)

For everyone going through a breakup:
Know that you are not alone. The physical pain, the feeling of betrayal, the sleepless nights, dreaming of them and waking up with a heavy heart, losing your appetite, crying until you wish you could just disappear and die just so you don’t have to feel the hurt for one more second. We ALL go through this, and that’s precisely the strange beauty behind it. We are all connected by this pain, we all feel this powerful and destructive emotion, we all think we’ll never move on, never find someone as good, never make it through this grieving that feels unbearable.

But please, trust me when I say that you WILL move on, sooner or later. This pain will ALWAYS ease with time. Soon you’ll realize you no longer cry every night before falling asleep, but maybe just once a week. Soon you’ll notice you don’t feel like stalking their social media anymore because you’ll have no desire to keep destroying yourself and your efforts. Soon you’ll start enjoying your favorite activities again. You’ll discover new passions to pass the time. You’ll rediscover the joy of going out with your friends without always bringing them up in conversation.

Just give yourself time. I know it’s hard, but your pain will eventually fade, and you WILL find someone else. You WILL fall in love again. You WILL find someone who chooses YOU, who fights to keep you, who communicates, who treats you as you truly deserve. That other person simply wasn’t the right one, because if they really were, if they truly loved you unconditionally, they would have fought for you. They would have tried to communicate, they never would’ve allowed to let you go in that way.

And for everyone doubting themselves, thinking they’ll never find love, that something inside them seems to always push people away, that they’re worthless because their ex didn’t even try to come back: you WILL find love, and you ARE a good person with a good heart.

How do I know it? Because you’re here on this reddit thread trying to piece your broken heart back together. Because you loved with everything you had, enough to feel this pain as deeply as you feel it right now. Because you can’t stop thinking of them, even in your dreams. Because you tried to fix things. Because you cried every tear in your body every night. Because you tried to apologize. Because there were times when you couldn’t even eat from sadness and guilt.

If you know you gave your best, you have nothing to blame yourself for. I know you have a good heart because you loved with all your soul, even when it was scary. And you will be able to love just as much, if not even more, the next person who will truly deserve it. :)

Here are some helpful tips to get over them and to move on: 

Pick up a new hobby, learn how to cook and bake, sign up to the gym, try a new sport, play video games, get a cat or a dog, find a fun job, try roller skating, go read that book you’ve always wanted to read in a cute coffee shop, expand your knowledge! Be grateful and let this breakup be an opportunity to learn new skills and try new experiences. Find the positive in the negative! 

Start journaling, Write the date for every entree. Everytime you feel like reaching out, stalking their social or feel like your emotions are too much to handle, write everything you’re feeling down. Let it be ugly, let it be messy, just write and let it out. A few months from now, you’ll take comfort in realizing how far you’ve come when you reread what you wrote back then.

Do NOT stalk their social media, do not block them, just stay away from them. You cannot heal near the person or the place who/that hurt you.

Try to get rid of anything that will make you think of them. Gifts, letters, bracelets, texts, pictures. You don’t have to throw it out if it’s hard for you at the moment, but just hide them until you feel like you can throw them away or delete them. 

You have to want to heal. You cannot be expecting their return and want to heal at the same time. stop expecting. Someone who leaves you once will ALWAYS do it again. 

Try to stop thinking too much about it by analyzing your feelings or overthinking the situation and what could’ve been different. you cannot heal if you constantly think about it everyday and put your brain in this sort of ritual state where you ruminate on the situation constantly. Your brain will always act accordingly and make it hard for you to move on. Analyze once you’re over the situation and not biased by your pain. ",6,1755837647.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1mwx4zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlexandriaMN/comments/1mwx4zb/warning_to_the_people_of_alexandria_mn_about/,"Warning to the people of Alexandria, MN about Violet Maus!!! PT. 3/3","DISCLAIMER: this is my fiancés story pulled from her Reddit to warn citizens of Alexandria, MN about Violet’s behavior. We even changed the names to their real names so people can be warned. This story is not fake and is a legitimate warning. Please, take it seriously. 

BIG UPDATE: Hello Reddit! It’s been a while! And I have a lot to update you on regarding this story. First of all, I will be revealing real names now (but only first names) because everyone needs to be warned about the girl you all know as “Purple”. A few months into the school year, Maya, aka “Ouchie”, and I stopped being friends. Mayo (which is his real nickname) and I are also no longer friends. After the Violet, aka “Purple”, incident, I realized it’s better to cut off people who treat you like shit rather than keep them in your life until they ruin you, so I cut them both off. I got a boyfriend, who is now my fiancé, and we live together about an hour away from all Violet drama, but I still get updates and you all need some too.

At the beginning of the school year, I was really worried about going back to school with Violet. As you all have read, she did not quit her antics, even majority of the way through the school year. My friend, she one she tried to push down the stairs, is named Jay. Jay and I began working together and Violet would casually show up, parking her car across from or next to Jay’s and even staring at them while smoking weed (as a 17-18 year old) in the parking lot. Her stalking never let up.

Eventually, my then-boyfriend-now-fiancé and I met, and because he lived an hour away, I could talk about him, and I would. I’d be talking about him with one of my friends in the bathroom, which Violet, of course, was in. Talking about the morning and goodnight paragraphs, him buying presents for my family and buying me flowers and treats every time he came to visit, etc.

Violet had a boyfriend for a while, but, when I found mine, hers had just broken up with her because she was “exactly like everyone said”. So, of course, me having such an amazing person in my life pissed her off all over again. Her antics got worse, but I was learning to deal with them. That is, until, she saw Jay and I at our local Walmart and followed me to my house (10 minutes out of the way to her house) and tried to ram us off the road during a massive blizzard.

Of course, we reported this to our SRO but, of course, he did nothing.

It got worse and worse but I was able to manage it. However, just at the start of Christmas break, I decided to stay with my mother after she told me some concerning things about my father and I believed her. I continued to live with her until April, just after my 18th birthday, when the shit had truly hit the fan. My mother had always been abusive, even getting arrested twice for domestic abuse against my father, but it was mostly in the safety of our own home when no one was over. Now, we had 2-5 extra people living with us (depending on what day it was) and no matter what I did to help her, she still was the same she had always been, only now it was in front of people.

I went to stay with my boyfriend one weekend and told him what was going on and that I didn’t want to go home. He generously offered me a place to live, with him. I went back to her house once to get my stuff and she pinned me down and yanked my phone out of my hands while I was actively on the phone with a 911 operator, worried about my safety. An officer, who had already been waiting outside for my call, came in, I got my stuff, and I left crying harder than I had ever cried in my life knowing I couldn’t live with little siblings or see my dogs grave ever again. I thought the Violet drama was over. Keyword “thought”.

I lived with my boyfriend, I did all my schooling online. It was hard and there were A LOT of complications but I even graduated from the same school. I saw Violet there but I didn’t contact her and I think I only looked at her once. Finally, this period of my life was over. That was, until today.

After months of silence on the Violet front, I got a text from a friend, Grey, who had worked with her at a nursing home in my hometown. I know, the irony of her stalking and threatening me and then working at a nursing home where her whole job is to take care of people is not lost on me.

Anyways, today I got a text that has so much tea, I could start my own tea shop, if not for the fact that I’m about to spill it all.

Grey and I were casually catching up when he mentioned that Violet was fired. I asked what had happened and all the overthinking and dreaming in the world couldn’t have prepared me for this.

Background (cause I don’t know if I’ve said it before): Violet is adopted. Her adoptive family is incredible and has truly had a hand in raising me. They are incredibly loving and supportive people and the ultimate picture perfect family for adoption. The family any foster kid would want. Her mom is a paramedic who bakes for events in her spare time. They live in a huge house and have a beautiful family with 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 7 kids. Violet once called me telling me they were abusing her and when I asked what happened, she said they had yelled at her because her room was a disaster. That’s the worst it ever was in her household. It was actually really upsetting to hear someone use the word “abuse” in a situation like that when I had grown up in a house where I was thrown into walls, pinned down or against various items, made to sleep naked on the kitchen floor and outside as a pre-teen, and even told to kill myself by my own mother, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg on my side.

Anyways, Grey revealed to me today that Violet was fired for 2 reasons. The first being lying about her homelife. Apparently, Violet had said that she was homeless and her mom was “a crackwhore”. This, in and of itself, is already upsetting given how much I still love that family despite all Violets done to my friends and I. However, the most upsetting news of all, Violet apparently had an issue with a 90 year old resident at the nursing home and decided to deliberately pour scorching hot coffee on her, causing 3rd degree burns. The woman died less than a week later. The worst part? They can’t charge Violet with anything, at least pertaining to murder. While the cameras caught the coffee incident, they have no proof that Violet had anything to do with the woman’s death. No one knows if the family knows about what Violets done but all of us know that that family will never find closure.

I found this all out today, just mere hours ago. I truly don’t know what to do. Her mom is on vacation in London, and while I have her contact information, this is a lot to dump on someone while they’re on vacation. Then there’s the question of whether or not she’ll even believe me. The police can’t/won’t do anything and the family may not even know that their loved one was a victim of such malicious behavior.

Here’s the thing: I caught feelings way earlier than I admitted to myself. But I was terrified of ruining the friendship. She’s one of the few people I feel completely myself around, and the idea of losing that scared me more than anything.

Last week, we were hanging out in the library, and she was stressing about a project. I tried to cheer her up, and out of nowhere, she looked at me and said, “You always know how to make me feel better. You’re kind of my favorite person.”

I swear my heart just *stopped*.

So I blurted it out. Like, literally blurted it. I said, “Well, good… because you’re my favorite person too. Actually, more than favorite. I think I like you.”

There was this long pause where I thought I had just messed everything up… but then she smiled. Like, the kind of smile that makes your whole chest feel warm. And she said, “I was wondering when you’d finally say it.”

We’re not suddenly “official” yet, but she held my hand when we walked home that night. And honestly? That tiny gesture meant everything.

I don’t know where this will go, but for once, I’m glad I took the risk.",8,1755837381.0,confessions,3,0.91,False
1mwx373,https://i.redd.it/d72jzt1l0ikf1.jpeg,Yall- I forgot about the fanfic. And then I wrote all of this. Srry gng. Light Unto the Elites: Chapter 5 Onward,"I'm too tired to do all the indentation and formatting, so please forgive me. Furthermore, my apologies for the low-quality chapters you are about to read. I'll try and do better for the following chapters. Of course, it's not a good excuse, but I really wanted to get to the outsmarting aspect of this fanfiction, and so you'll at least get to see an expulsion by the end of reading this (Hint: He's one of my least favorite COTE characters. Try and guess who.) As usual, I'd appreciate any tips you have. Thanks for reading. Peace. (I'll probably edit these chapters soon and post them to Wattpad as well.)  
  
Chapter 5: S-System



This boy must have been English. His looks and demeanor were seemingly out of touch with almost any culture I knew of. A faint smell of sweets emanated from around him whilst he vigorously bit his nails. His presence, in short, was distinctly alien from the rest of my classmates, and perhaps even the rest of the world. It was around the time that I had begun this train of thought that he began to slip off his shoes, and subsequently started twiddling his big toes. It was an odd sight for sure, and most uncomfortable to look at. To pry myself away from this rather conspicuous boy, I stood up, my classmates turning their attention to me almost immediately: Introductions were in place.	“Hi everyone! I’m Yagami Light! I was thinking that, since we’ll be spending the coming years with each other, it’s important that we get to know each other! If it’s okay, we could all go around introducing ourselves before the teacher arrives! Because you already know about my name, I guess I’d also like you guys to know that I’m really glad to have made it here, and hope to have a great high school experience with you all!”	What came next was a resounding amount of applause, especially from most of the girls. A delicate hand raised, and a tired, yet firm and happy voice enveloped the room.

“Hello. I’m Shirashi Asuka. It’s a pleasure to meet you all. As Yagami said, I’m glad to be here, and look forward to getting to know you guys.”

Once more, people clapped. I didn't particularly enjoy introductions, but I figured that I might do well to take some leadership with this class. Besides, all I needed to do was clap occasionally and listen when it interested me. Not much to it.

As per usual, there was at least one problematic figure. Don’t get the wrong idea, though. He didn't seem to be a delinquent or a punk; rather, he rubbed me as a sly fox. A tricky one who might cause trouble in the class in the long run. I decided I might try and befriend him to keep tabs on him. Mentally noting down his name, I thought it sounded a tad funny. “Masayoshi Hashimoto”. Didn't quite roll off the tongue too well.

It was just a bit after the last introduction was finished that our teacher walked in and stood behind his desk at the front. He had the demeanor of a true educator, both upright and caring. His brown hair contrasted with his older face, and so I thought he might have dyed it. With a firm tonality, he began:	“Hello, and welcome. My name is Tomonari Mashima, and I will be your homeroom instructor for the coming years. Firstly, I’d like you to have this. Please pass them back.”	Mashima-sensei lifted from the desk at the front a stack of informational booklets, likely the rulebook.	He then proceeded through an explanation of the basic rules. The main thing that I garnered from this explanation was the foundation of this school’s transactional side, that being the point system. Basically, points are to be divided into two separate types: 1. Private points, and 2. Class points. Private points are used for personal transactions on campus, and, with this school offering a variety of facilities, it’s not hard to see how these come in handy. When it came to private points, 1 point equaled 1 yen. The latter type of points, class points, are what determine the standing of classes.	While I went over these rules in my head, a thought occurred to me, one which I made sure to voice.	“Mashima-Sensei, I have a question.”	“Yes, Yagami?”	“I understand that as of now, we’ve been allotted 100,000 private points, but that won’t be enough to get us through the year. I was wondering how we receive private points throughout the year.”

A few students started whispering among themselves, but that was soon cut off by Mashima-Sensei’s stern voice.	“Excellent question. You students will be receiving private points based on your class points. Class points may be gained through positive contributions to the school community, class cooperation, good marks, good behavior, and scoring well on exams. That’s why it’s imperative you all strive to do your best.”

“Thank you.”	Sitting back down, I considered what this meant for our class. This type of system was one which would reward strong leadership, not chaos and disorderly action. 	“Any other questions?” Mashima-Sensei paused for a brief moment and then continued.	“I’ll be going, then. Good luck to you all.”

Chapter 6: The Following Days



Around a week had passed since the initial explanation of the school’s “S-System”, and a week had also passed since I had last shopped for groceries. As the bell rang, signaling the end of the school day, I quickly packed up and walked quickly in the direction of the school plaza. I entered the grocery store and decided that I might get some BBQ potato chips in addition to what I had bought last time. Oddly, the chip bag had a TV logo on it. In the past week, I had observed a plethora of punks and delinquents roaming the school, so it was weird to me that self-checkout was the norm for most stores. Looking at the roof of the building, I supposed that the security cameras took care of that. 

On my way back from the store, I heard two familiar voices coming from a seemingly deserted alley. I paused, just about to turn the corner, and listened. 	“Y’know…” The first voice began slyly.	“You seem much more fun than class A– What I mean to say is: Let’s team up. I can help you if you can help me.”

I wasn’t shocked to hear that this first voice was Hashimoto’s. It only confirmed my suspicions that he was more treacherous than loyal. And with this confirmed, my blood began to boil.	“Tch. You don’t have anything yet, do you? Only come if you have something to give, then we'll talk. Got it?”	The second voice seemed to be the magenta-haired boy from the registration line.

“Heh. Yeah, yeah…” 	Hearing footsteps approach my location, I silently ran the other direction, taking the long route to my dorm. It was during this walk that I felt an excitement build up in my chest. This wasn’t something to be worried about: It was an opportunity. It was an opportunity to cleanse this school of one more piece of trash. To cleanse class A of a liability, of a traitor, of a filthy little liar… When, though… How? How?

This was the thought that dominated my mind for weeks… How? How to rid us of him? Even the announcement that Class A had beaten out all the others in terms of class points for the month seemed to pale in comparison to this thought. A trivial character, Hashimoto, was wrapped up in such an important matter. The problem of Hashimoto and his punishment was resolved with the announcement of the first exam: A purely academic exam which, if failed, would result in an expulsion.

Now was the time.



Chapter 7: The First Days of Light



	After class had ended, I stood up and mustering some courage, proceeded to ask the class if they could stay for just a few moments. Most of them agreed, including Hashimoto.	“Alright. Thank you so much for sparing a bit of your time for this. I think I know a way that we can all pass this exam. It may sound trivial, but I know it’s something that’s helped me in the past with tough exams, and that’s study groups. We could all help each other, and I think this would not only be a great way to score class points, but also a great way to get to know each other!”

	The class burst out into positive chatter, and most seemed to be enthusiastic about the idea. I let the talking naturally die down and continued with my announcement:	“So, it sounds like most of you guys are up to it. That’s great! But I think it would be best to establish groups right now so that we might be able to study sooner rather than later. To do that, we should have leaders for each group. Needless to say, I’d like to be one, but are there any other volunteers?”

	Sakayanagi stood up, along with Katsuragi.	Softly, Sakayanagi announced that she would take up a position as study group leader, and in a tough manner, Katsuragi did the same.

	“Great! Now, how about we choose who we’ll be managing? If it’s okay, I’d like to have Morishita, Shirasi, Kito, Takemoto, Totsuka, and Hashimoto.”	All six of them responded positively, and Sakayanagi went next.	After she was done, Katsuragi picked up the rest, and the study groups each individually confirmed when their first meeting would be. The first meeting of my group was scheduled to be in two days, right after school, and at the cafe nearby. 



	As the leader, I arrived early and ordered some coffee for everyone. Almost immediately after I sat down, I saw Hashimoto walk in and waved to him. He came over with his signature smirk and sat across from me.	“That was a good idea of yours, Light. The study groups and all. It makes this boring thing all the more fun.”	“Thanks. But it’s really all because of you and my classmates that we’re able to do this in the first place, Hashimoto. I just don’t want to lose any friends to such a trivial thing.”	“Hm… Well, hopefully it’s not too hard an exam. I mean, it shouldn’t be that hard if it’s the first one they’re giving us.”	“Maybe, but I remember at my old school, our first test was the hardest by far. The only reason we knew that was because some upperclassmen told us, and then offered to give us juniors the test answers in exchange for 30,000 yen. I refused this offer, but some of my classmates went for it, and without studying, got a hundred out of a hundred on the test. In a way, it made me angry that I had gotten the same score but with much more effort.”	It was after I finished telling him this fabricated story that I saw his entire being light up.	“Really…? That’s pretty smart of them…” He muttered.	Suddenly, the rest of our group burst in through the door and crammed into the small booth that we would host this session in.	I passed out the coffees, and made sure to get some creamers and sugar. It seemed that Morishita really loved sugar, becaue she kept on making me get up and get just one pack at a time. After I had given her 10 packs of sugar, half of which she spilled, I gave up and started the session. All was well.



Chapter 8: Lunchtime Meeting



The next day, I sat down at lunch with a few friends and one enemy. As usual, Kito was keeping to himself, Machida was being serious, Hashimoto was teasing everyone, Morishita was arranging her food into a face (?), and Sakayanagi was gazing out into the distance with a slight smile. All of a sudden, Hashimoto was gone. As predicted.	My eyes scanned across the lunchroom, and I saw Hashimoto talking confidently to a bewildered upperclassman. I waited for about 5 minutes, at which point Hashimoto walked away with a smirk wider than usual. He stopped by the table, telling us he was gonna go and get some homework done in the library.

After making sure he was gone, I stood up.

“Hey, guys. I’ve gotta do something. Give me a second.” I said as I began walking towards the very upperclassman Hashimoto had just talked to. 

As I sat next to her, she glanced away nervously. I realized that I might come off as rude, but in this situation, I figured it would be better to be forceful than graceful.	“I’m not gonna beat around the bush. He asked you for the test answers to the upcoming exam for the first years, didn't he?”	“Y-yeah… What about it?”	“And you gave them to him. In exchange for private points.”	“N-No!” She said a bit too loudly.	“Yes, you did. I know you did. It’s unfortunate your greed consumed you to the point it would be permissible to allow cheating on his end… I feel sorry for you. So that’s why I’m not ratting you out just yet. If you come with me and confess this, then I’ll let you off the hook. How does that sound?	“A-Are you blackmailing me? That’s illegal!""	A feeble attempt at getting out of this. “I’m not blackmailing you. I’m helping you. I’m making sure you don’t get the wrong end of the stick when all of this is revealed. Help me help you.”	“I… O-Okay…” She managed to mutter.	I stood up, and she did the same. We walked towards Mashima-Sensei’s office, and I was later able to get her to confess the whole situation to him. It was as she was finishing her story that I heard a cane lightly tapping across the floor outside the office door. Sakayanagi entered and sat down. After the girl was done with her explanation of the situation, Sakayanagi corroborated and, to my surprise, asked Mashima-Sensei to re-make the test. All of this was unexpected by me, as I hadn’t planned for her contribution, and yet she was playing her unintended role beautifully. Seeing where she was taking this, I agreed, asking him to change the questions for the sake of fairness. Mashima-Sensei eventually agreed, and I left the room satisfied until I heard Sakayanagi call out to me.	“I see what you’re doing. I see you.”	“What do you mean?”	“You know.”	I continued walking and ended up back at the lunch table with a few minutes to spare before our next class.   
  
Chapter 9: Judgment Day	  
  
Ever since Hashimoto had talked to that girl, he had skipped all the study sessions. And when the fateful day of the test arrived, his face fell. It fell down an endless well, and that perpetual smirk of his was shattered into a million pieces. For the entirety of the day, he sat there, motionless. Unable to act, unable to betray. You see? This is what happens to people who step out of line, to insolent idiots who think they can parade around offering up their loyalty to the highest bidder. The next day, test scores were announced, and Hashimoto had failed. He was to be expelled. And although my face reflected deep sadness that my friend had been taken out of the picture, my true face, my soul reveled in his expulsion. So long, friend. 		(((((((((For those who don’t get it, this is an explanation of Light’s expulsion of Hashimoto.1. Light indirectly manipulates Hashimoto into getting test answers from an upperclassman.2. Light, for the next few days, would go on to stalk Hashimoto until he talks to an upperclassman about the test.3. Because Hashimoto would likely choose someone susceptible to coercion, Light would be able to extract a confession from the upperclassman and use it to get Mashima (Someone who wants things to be fair) to change the test questions.4. Due to Hashimoto’s “ends justify the means” perspective, he would only base his studying off of the answer sheet given to him by the upperclassman, and furthermore sell the answers to class C.5. This means that Hashimoto and most of class C would be unprepared for the test, and a large number of students would be expelled.)))))))))

1mwwyig,https://www.reddit.com/r/austincirclejerk/comments/1mwwyig/i_think_im_getting_too_conservative_to_appreciate/,I think I'm getting too conservative to appreciate Austin,"I lived in Austin since 2001.  I moved here right out of college when I was a socialist hippie who puffed a bong like a steam train engine's smoke stack and popped viagra pills and had wild sex orgies every other night.  I believed that Karl Marx understood complex human psychology and economics and had all the answers.  I would march with the Austin Red Shirts and harass other leftists meeting in coffee shops who weren't communist enough.   I was on top of the world and loved living in Austin thinking the Revolution was just around the corner and I would be eating the rich

Over time I grew to realize the weed, sex parties, and communism weren't really my thing anymore.  Violent communist revolution like in Cuba, Russia, and China started to not seem like such a good idea to implement here in the USA.  I got tired of constantly having to go to the doctor to treat my STDs.  Not constantly puffing my bong gave me clarity of mind.  Then it hit me.  I was starting to not appreciate Austin so much anymore.  The crime, the homelessness, the traffic, the endless stream of r/austin posts asking to identify snakes or remind people not to walk their dogs in 100 degree weather.  It all seems less exciting now.  I was thinking the other day that it's not really fair trans women are allowed to compete in womens' sports.    Am I turning into a conservative?

1mwwtqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1mwwtqy/were_2_bootstrapped_founders_0_revenue_and/,"We’re 2 bootstrapped founders, $0 revenue, and building 2 SaaS products at once (probably a bad idea, but here’s our story)","Hello everyone 👋

We are two friends who chose to enter the SaaS space by bootstrapping instead of looking for funding. Although it's probably not the best course of action, it feels right to us.

We are currently simultaneously working on two products:

1. An artificial intelligence (AI) LinkedIn automation tool (since we were sick of expensive, cumbersome ones).
2. Because pricing shouldn't feel like highway robbery, we're aiming for $15/month for a form builder that is significantly less expensive than Typeform.

The catch is this:

* We are totally broke, or bootstrapped.
* So far, we have not generated any revenue.
* Despite everyone's advice to concentrate on just one thing, we are obstinately attempting two.

What's the point of posting here?  
Because we want to do more than just shout, ""Look at our product!"" We want to share our experience with those who have been in the trenches or are just starting out, including our victories, mistakes, and lessons learned.  
  
A few brief facts:

* Initial beta testers? Of them, half abandoned us. 
* Crickets were the first launch. 
* The most important lesson? Distribution is a nightmare, but building is simple. 
* Why continue? Because we're having a great time and learning a ton even with no money.

Our purpose is to:  

* Talk about what we're learning, including user churn, pricing experiments, and cold emails.

1mwws8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mwws8w,Alfa and Kayky,"Alfa was born from a destroyed future, the original future shaped by the victory of Zerek, an absolute evil that condemned the entire universe. Her race specimes are naturally born much more rigid, massively more powerful than any human and blessed with a natural regeneration comparable to Majin Buu(Dragon Ball Z)
[Basically a Tetramand+Majin]

During the fall of her original universe, a time capsule was used to send her back into the past as a child, but the process erased nearly all of her memories, leaving her with nothing but fragmented flashes of a future that no longer existed.
[It's unknown who put her on the Time Capsule]

In this past timeline, Alfa was found by a couple belonging to a race similar to hers, also four-armed but with blue skin, who adopted her as their own daughter.
(Random information: Alfa developed a liking for coffee and milk overtime)

By the age of fifteen, Alfa had developed an interest in martial arts and soon met an old master on her planet who introduced her to rigorous combat training and the use of Ki. From the very beginning, her training was focused on channeling her immense power into a single point, learning to give devastating precision strikes without destroying everything around her. Her master also taught her the basics of conjuring her attacks, and she mastered these teachings in less than two years, a feat that would normally take more time. Before parting ways, the old master gave her his diary of techniques, and with it, Alfa bid farewell to both him and her foster parents, setting off into space on a ship to begin her journey.

A year later, while traveling between planets, Alfa stopped by a city where a martial arts tournament was being held, and she decided to join for fun. She easily defeated most of her opponents while holding back, but in the finals, she met Kayky for the very first time. Their battle was explosive, lasting more than thirty minutes of relentless exchanges with neither side giving in, and in the midst of their fierce clash, the two began to feel a strange attraction towards one another. The fight ended in a draw when Kayky, acting on instinct alone, unleashed a Nen strike that temporarily disabled Alfa’s regeneration and managed to knock her down, but in doing so he also knocked himself out. The tournament victory was handed to a bizarre masochist fighter that Alfa had previously defeated, someone so unsettling that she refused to fight him After landing a punch on him.

After the tournament, Alfa and Kayky decided to spend time together, and she stayed on that planet for three weeks. In that span of time, their bond grew strong enough to form a friendship, and Kayky chose to accompany her on her journey, driven both by his growing love for her and a desire to protect her. Three years later, they had already become a couple, and during another tournament, Kayky proposed to her in the middle of the arena, and they married right then and there in front of the crowd. They continued to travel together for another year until a chilling call echoed across the universe: Zerek had returned, giving warriors twelve days to gather on a specific planet or he would annihilate much of the universe’s life.

Though the Nexus, the most powerful warriors in existence, were away in intense training inside a massive time chamber with crushing gravity, other less experienced warriors united to hold back Zerek and build time for the Nexus. Alfa and Kayky joined one such time chamber, where for ten years they endured unbearable conditions after someone accidentally triggered a gravity of one billion times, pinning them to the ground for eight years until they adapted. The remaining two years were spent refining their Ki techniques, and during this time Kayky also learned the basics of Nen alongside Alfa.
(The training got them a 50x AMP from their previous Level)

When the group emerged, they marched into the battlefield where Zerek awaited. Their enemy was a master of both Ki and Nen, capable of amplifying his attacks up to 2000% thanks to his extra arms and mouth, and he opened the battle by splitting an offguard warrior in half with a single flying slash. Alfa reacted instantly, pulling Kayky out of the way as Zerek unleashed a rain of deadly strikes. During All the confusion, Alfa surged forward with all her speed and planted a clean kick to Zerek’s face. For the briefest moment, the battlefield froze with the scene. Zerek’s head snapped back, and a single drop of blood rolled down his cheek. The warriors gasped, hope sparking for an instant... only for it to be shattered when Zerek’s expression twisted in fury. He caught Alfa midair, ragdolled her brutally across the ground, and sent her crashing into the debris. Dazed and battered, she forced herself up, but in that chaos came the moment when Kayky was gravely wounded while tanking a attack to save Her.(Zerek send a Slash on her)

Desperation consumed Alfa, who tore off part of her own flesh and forced her regeneration into Kayky, sustaining his life as he boosted the process with his own Ki. When another slash was about to cut them both down, Alfa concentrated all her Ki into her palms and deflected it, though the deflection cost the life of another fighter.

In retaliation, Zerek invoked his ultimate ability: the Divine Prison, a domain-like technique that erased the regenerative and slecial abilities of anyone who had not mastered Nen, killing 99% percent of the other warriors instantly. Alfa used every ounce of her power to shield Kayky, covering his body with her own and turning her Ki into a barrier of sheer resistance, miraculously surviving the onslaught until the Nexus warriors finally arrived, forcing Zerek to release the domain. But before retreating, Zerek raised his hands, summoned a black sphere of energy, and sealed away all of the surviving non-Nexus warriors, Alfa and Kayky among them.

As the black sphere swallowed Alfa, Kayky, and the others, Zerek lowered his arms and exhaled slowly. For the first time in centuries, he reached up and touched his chin. His fingers brushed against the faint line of Alfa’s unhealed strike, and a slight frown crossed his otherwise cold expression. For a moment, he lingered in thought, blood still fresh on his skin, an acknowledgment, however small, that someone beneath the Nexus had managed to scar him. But his eyes quickly hardened again, and with a dismissive tilt of his head, he turned toward the Nexus warriors who now stood before him and eat the black Ball.

Thus ending Alfa and Kayky’s story.

[ The Second Slide is the Zerek Villain. Not my design, but Well, he's the great villain of the verse that OC was ]

Author Statements(What I remember about the Power Levels of the Verse):

Nexus Members: As a whole, the average Nexus members possess a base power level comparable to Goku Super Saiyan 2 (DBZ). This applies to their natural state, without amplifiers or transformations. (No one on the Nexus have a transformation)

Zerek: His power level is at least four times greater than that of an average Nexus member. While Nexus members were still capable of inflicting damage with specialized or high-output techniques, Zerek’s superiority in raw physical stats and his unique attacks made him more dominant in direct combat.",3,1755836364.0,OriginalCharacterDB,7,0.81,False
