Pretty happy with the rest of my home office, but not sure what I want to do with this empty wall and corner. Should I hang wall art, how many and what sizes would you recommend? Maybe another file cabinet or a small coffee table? 

Any ideas welcome.

1qnabo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fearless-Seesaw7386/comments/1qnabo8/aita_i_dont_feel_like_my_friends_of_20_years/,AITA I don’t feel like my friends of 20 years believe me following ending my abusive relationship,"Me f(46) have been school playground friends with Jo f(50) and Sam f(50) for 20 years. Our kids grew up together. 

At times there would be group get together where husbands would join so they knew my husband John m(53) but he never really meshed with the group, he chatted to their husbands but he didn’t socialise outside of these occasional gatherings.

Over the years my friends became closer with each other and I felt pushed out, Jo already had a large group of friends and she included Sam in this and they would go on breaks away and shopping trips etc. There was another friend who also got to join in with all this. I initially was invited along Ona Ge day trips but then I was replaced by another person and felt incredibly sad and isolated. I had very few friends and was in an abusive relationship (I didn’t ever say anything about this) there would be parties and I would be in the room while they all discussed the last fab night out they had or were organising their next one, if I said I would love to go the room would go silent then they would change subject.

I left my husband when my eldest was 18, it was traumatic!  I had warned him I was thinking of leaving and that made things worse, he didn’t believe I would, he publicly left me in a huge social occasion with Sam and her family there, he told Sam he had left me. I don’t think he thought I would accept it and would beg him back. I gleefully accepted, he tried to beg me back the next few days becoming more and more desperate and abusive, gaslighting me, saying I left him and I was destroying the family etc… I fled with my daughter f(18) we had to stay in temporary accommodation but I had planned it and had an empty house it just happened faster than expected and arrangements weren’t possible immediately. 

My ex ramped things up… police got involved the past and present were raked up and they wanted to charge him with domestic abuse. I had kept evidence and there was enough to prosecute him if I chose to, I decided to not press charges and have a cease and desist brought to him from the police and my solicitor. It helped but I had to return a further 2 times to the police. I was sorted by charities and my GP.

My friend Jo is someone I had confided in after I left John. Both Jo and Sam finally heard how tough life has been.  John contacted Jo and said he would always be there to help her out if she needed it, that was the last contact they had.

John suddenly started contacting Sam’s husband, they started going for coffee every week. I was upset as John was clearly trying to get into my small friend group. I left it and carried on, at this point life unravelled for me, following Johns relentless messages and his financial control I became very depressed, I wanted to end my life, I told Jo, she was shocked, I didn’t get any check in from her after that.

I saw Jo and Sam occasionally these last few years, Jo more so, we would have coffee, go to a quiz, I decided that was enough and to just keep the equilibrium. I made some fantastic new friends after my depression lifted, I had therapy, and started again, I have a great social life and career. Jo wanted to join me in one of my groups and I put her off, I felt bad but she has loads of friends and I like that I have no bitter history with these new people who like me and include me in everything.

I went to Jo’s house 6 months ago for drinks with her and Sam, Sam suddenly revealed John was doing work on her house, I was so upset, after all the abusive behaviour she is having him round and paying him, she says it isn’t her it is her husband, obviously she must have a say??? Both thought my reaction was totally unreasonable. It turns out they are Facebook friends still with John and that Sam’s daughter feeds Johns cat when he is away. 

I am incredibly hurt and haven’t contacted either since except a few messages, recently I pulled out of a meet up and Jo said a few things so I messaged her privately, she thinks I should apologise to Sam for calling her disloyal, she is angry with me, I honestly thought I should have the apology… I feel it is very toxic. 

Sub note…John lived and worked in a city many miles away with his new partner but bought a house just round the corner from me, when he split with his partner he decided to move within walking distance of my house. 

Both the children come stay university holidays with me and never with John. As an example of Johns behaviour the first thing he said when I told him I wasn’t coming back was that he publicly declared I r\*\*\*d him to get pregnant with our son, he made me so depressed the first year with our son I didn’t know if I was coming or going, social services were called due to his temper, he publicly told anyone and everyone I tricked him into having our son and that he didn’t want him, he has never been close to our son, something that has got back to our son, everything was consensual I was only 23 he was 29 in the armed forces when I got pregnant.  That is the main reason I went to the police. Both Jo and Sam know he said this.

Am I unreasonable to cut contact with Jo and Sam? My friend says I should value the old friendship. ",1,1769415482.0,u_Fearless-Seesaw7386,0,1.0,False
1qnabo4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qnabo4,Meet Cinnamon Scroll - the opposite of Cake,"  
Name: Cinnamon Scroll 



Nickname: Cinna



Gender: Boy



Pronouns: He/Him



Personality: arrogant, assertive, independent, blunt, tough,  fearless, and has a leader type of attitude. Cinnamon Scroll rarely doubts himself and hates being underestimated. He prefers leading over following and doesn’t sugarcoat his opinions (ironically). Unlike Cake’s softness and insecurity, Cinna is confident to the point of intimidation and believes strength earns respect, not kindness. His personality isn’t only black and white; he also has empathy, is extremely loyal, and shows respect to others if they show them back to him. He is also really laid-back at times.



Appearance: Cinnamon Scroll is a tightly coiled, warm brown cinnamon roll with a bold spiral center. He has no arms, but his posture and facial expressions make him look imposing anyway.



Likes:

\* Intense, high-stakes challenges 

\* Leading his team to victory 

\* Earning respect through raw power

\* Loyalty and honesty 

\* Being liked more than feared

\* Direct, no-nonsense confrontation

\* Being more than just mean and bitter

\* Straightforward people who don’t waste his time

\* His crew 



Dislikes:

\* Cowards 

\* False idols or hypocrites

\* Losing control of a situation

\* Being only considered rude or bitter

\* Being pitied or babied

\* People who can’t handle tough love 

\* Fake politeness or forced niceness

\* Anyone who tries to “fix” him or tell him he’s “too harsh”

\* Cake’s Loser-centric BFB self (or anyone who is a suck-up to another person)

\* People who cry over every little loss

\* Being compared to Cake (he finds it insulting)

\* Overly sweet or fake personalities 



Voice:

Basically just like Cake’s but deeper and street gangster like. He often speaks in a calm tone and drops casual slang into his speech without trying (eg. “You’re wild for that”, “homie”, “that ain’t it”, and many other AAVE-inspired slang without forcing it) . He rarely raises his tone, but when he does, you know you pissed him off and you are definitely in trouble. When Cinnamon Scroll does yell, it’s sharp, cutting, and commanding, never frantic or whiny. Voice actor ideas include Kenzie Bryant (because she’s Cake’s voice actor) and maybe Satomi Hinatsu, who can make characters sound sharp (take Fanny for an example), but mostly Kenzie.



Abilities / Skills:

• Naturally strategic. He’s great at reading opponents and predicting moves.

• Master of intimidation: his glare and calm, blunt remarks are enough to make opponents second-guess themselves.

• Can roast someone and always win the argument. He’s merciless and precise with words, never misses a target.

• Athletic and agile 

\* Calm under pressure 

\* Leadership instincts – knows when to push forward, when to hold back, and how to motivate his team without coddling them.

• Can easily persuade or manipulate others. He knows the words to say to get people on his side or make them doubt themselves, without ever seeming desperate.

• High pain tolerance. He may look soft like an actual cinnamon roll, but he can take a beating and keep moving without flinching.

• Survival instincts: He thrives in chaos, whether it’s a competition or social conflict.

• Surprisingly compassionate and emphatic. He can read people’s emotions and situations accurately and respond in ways that earn respect without losing his edge.

•  He is also a great brawler. When there is physical confrontation, his fighting style, a mix of mixed martial arts and street-fighting tactics, is always effective and brutal. Since he doesn’t have arms, he normally relies on kicks, headbutts, tackles, and rolling attacks. Also, one roundhouse kick to the head from him will most likely knock an opponent out cold. 

• Mobility expert: Uses rolling, and explosive bursts to dodge attacks and position himself advantageously. 

• Fearless mentality: Rarely hesitates, even in situations most would consider suicidal.

• Extreme focus: When he sets his mind on a goal, distractions are irrelevant. He’s methodical and single-minded in pursuit of victory.



Weaknesses:

• Trust issues – While loyal to those who earn it, he’s extremely slow to trust newcomers and can misjudge someone’s intentions.

• Temper under provocation: While usually calm, if someone repeatedly challenges or mocks him, his patience can snap, leaving him reckless for a short period.

• Obsessive competitiveness: Cinna hates losing more than anything, and this obsession can make him reckless or cause him to overextend in challenges.

• Perfectionist tendencies: He sets extremely high standards for himself and his team. Mistakes frustrate him, and sometimes he punishes himself or others too harshly.

• Fear of irrelevance: While he projects dominance, deep down he hates being ignored or overlooked, which can lead him to make rash decisions to prove his worth.

• Overconfidence:  Believes he’s mostly right; occasionally underestimates opponents, which can backfire. However, please note that he is not narcissistic or self-centred. He is actually quite humble and grounded.

• Emotional walls: While capable of empathy, he rarely expresses vulnerability or asks for help.  This makes it hard for others to support him, and people often misread his silence or gruffness as uncaring when he’s actually struggling inside.



Potential relationships:



Cake (close friends, almost brotherhood-like): Back when Cake was in his heavy Loser-worship phase during BFB, Cinna would’ve hated it with a passion, seeing Cake as a pathetic fanboy who threw away his own potential to simp for a celebrity, but he was never rude to Cake and instead he’d hit him with blunt, tough-love reality checks like “Dude, you got a bunch of potential right there in you, and you’re wastin’ it chasin’ after some overhyped celebrity? You’re better than that, homie!”, “When the hell are you gonna grow a backbone and stand up for yourself?”, and “Look, I’m not trying to tear you down. All I want see is for you to improve and show the world what you are truely got. Stop playin’ second fiddle.” When Cake joined TPOT without Loser and started to prove himself, Cinna got so much respect for Cake that he even considered him his closest allies, almost like a little brother. On the day Cake got eliminated in TPOT 8, in private, Cinna absolutely lost it, not because Cake regressed or learned nothing, but because he thinks that he failed Cake. A few minutes after Cake was sent to the elimination area, Cinna was seen absolutely pissed; kicking walls, yelling curses, and later breaking down alone, muttering to himself “I shoulda pushed him harder… shoulda made sure he knew he didn’t need anyone’s shadow.” Ever since, Cinna carries a quiet guilt about it and gets visibly tense whenever Cake’s name comes up in conversation. 



Loser (One-sided rivals): Cinna absolutely hates Loser. He sees Loser as the person who held Cake back the longest, turning a capable object into his fanboy for way too long. To Cinna, Loser isn’t even a real threat because Loser is all kind, humble, and respectful which Cinna respects, but he believes that Loser is overhyped, passive, and the reason why Cake hasn’t reached his full potential yet. Cinna views Loser’s “everyone loves me” aura as fake and unearned, calling it “manufactured clout” that crumbles under real pressure. He’d openly call Loser out with lines like “Aye, Loser, let’s keep it a hundred here. The only reason your former biggest fan ain’t around no more is ‘cause he finally woke up and stopped ridin’ your coattails. Matter of fact, the only reason why your former biggest fan never became the person he was supposed to be is ‘cause you kept him in your shadow.” or “You got more fans than the entire population of Earth? Oh please. You’re so overrated that Taylor Swift now has some competition for the most undeserved hype, except… at least she makes hits.” Cinna’s hatred towards Loser isn’t jealousy, it’s disgust at how Loser has ‘held Cake back’



Fanny (mutual respect): Cinna and Fanny has mutual respect for each other, mostly because of their simlair personalities and no-filter attitudes. Both are brutally honest, hate fake niceness, and have zero patience for weakness or sugarcoating. Fanny’s constant “I hate X” energy vibes with Cinna’s blunt roasts, he actually finds her refreshing instead of annoying. They’d team up in challenges without hesitation, trading savage one-liners and backing each other up when someone tries to insult one of them.  Fanny appreciates that Cinna doesn’t try to soften her edges or tell her to “be positive,” and Cinna likes that she never wastes time pretending to like people she doesn’t. Their dynamic is like two people who speak the same rude language fluently: short conversations, heavy on sarcasm, zero fluff. If anyone disrespects one of them, the other jumps in immediately with zero warning. Deep down, they’re ride-or-die for each other in that quiet, unspoken way tough people have.



Clock (friends): Clock is one of the only ex-Losers members that Cinnamon Scroll actually tolerates, scratch that, genuinely likes and respects. Clock's whole assertive, sophisticated, and calm personality clicks with Cinna in a way most don't. Clock doesn't beg for approval, doesn't fake humility to fish for compliments, and calls out nonsense when he sees it (even if he's more rule-focused and ""proper"" about it). Cinna may of been disappointed with Clock when he left Cake to simp for Winner (aka Loser’s now-reunited best friend). But even with that slip-up, Cinna still rates Clock highly because the dude stays composed, thinks three steps ahead, and doesn’t grovel for anyone’s approval.



Winner (Former friends, now enemies): When Winner first joined TPOT, Cinna respected Winner for their ambition to move on from the past and carve out their own path, even after Loser left them for mainstream and they faded into obscurity. Cinna saw real strength in Winner refusing to chase for clout and crawl back to a person who is the reason for their downfall in the first place. But after the events of TPOT 19 (Last One Standing) where Winner reunited with Loser in that hug scene, Cinna's respect for them evaporated. He saw it as a total betrayal of independence, Winner crawling back to the same ""overhyped"" figure who ditched them years ago, just over a piece of Loser ‘Os. Since then, the two have been bickering with each other nonstop, with Cinna calling Winner a ""spineless opportunist"" who ""sold out their own grind for a quick nostalgia hit."" Winner hits back by calling Cinna ""overly aggressive"" and ""stuck in his own ego,"" but Cinna just smirks and doubles down, saying stuff like ""Keep talkin', champ. Just wait until Loser has a knife in your back again” and “I respected grindin’ solo after Loser ditched ya, but nah, you crawled back into that shadow like it was comfy. Pathetic move, homie, thought you were built different."". The two actually got into a shoving battle once, which resulted in Cinna knocking Winner out cold with a roundhouse kick to the head.



Firey and Leafy (one-sided grudge): Cinna sees Firey and Leafy as two people that have been shoved down fans’ throats for over a decade, always appearing in promotional material and being constantly the de facto “main characters of BFDI” simply for being the two finalists of the first season. To him, they are absolutely overhyped, and he refuses to give them any automatic respect just because “history says so.”. He also believes that Firey and Leafy should just retire and pass the torch, saying one hitter lines like “Ay yo, where’s your retirement home at? It’s time to pack it up” and “You been around so long, people forgot what fresh competition even looks like.” Besides from that, Cinna has also criticised Leafy’s “Levels of Niceness” chart, pointing out how pretentious and self-serving it is, ranking everyone on their so-called niceness while putting herself level 103 (the highest) on the chart. He views the chart as a tool for Leafy to passively judge and categorize others while elevating herself above criticism and act all self-centred without even noticing it. He also views the chart as childish and ‘something a preschool teacher would use to reward and punish kids”. He would insult the chart by saying things like  “I like how you made a whole logarithmic scale just to pat yourself on the back and low-key judge everybody else. Real humble energy right there.” and “No offence, but it’s giving massive ‘preschool sticker chart’ vibes. You know like, ‘Johnny, here’s a gold star for not biting people today.’ Sit your ass down with that ‘preschool ahh chart.’ As for Firey, he doesn’t have any specific critics besides the whole “legacy act” issue, but Cinna does respect Firey for being the winner of season one.



Black Hole (neutral): Cinna hates how Black Hole prioritises preventing death over doing the actual challenge or winning. To Cinna, Black Hole's constant obsession with ""saving lives"" is worthless because they’re such things as recovery centers and the fact that contestants are here to compete. He does not hate Black Hole personally (he respects the calm demeanor and lack of ego), but he finds the fixation frustrating and counterproductive. He understands that Black Hole’s team was formed to prevent death, but he finds that recently, there has been no balance between preventing death and actually pursuing victory. Cinna views Black Hole's approach as noble in theory yet paralysing in practice, often muttering remarks such as “You want your team to play babysitter, huh? No wonder why they have been losing episodes back-to-back,” or “Bro, recovery centre exists for a reason. No wonder Fanny had to call out you out on that pacifist nonsense.”   



Remote (friends): Remote was introduced to Cinna by Fanny, and Cinna immediately had respect for Remote for her challenge-driven mindset, resourcefulness, and carefree yet competitive attitude. Cinna admits that Remote has the perfect mix of kindness and competitiveness. He respects how Remote always wants to be all friendly but never lets it soften her edge in competition, she'll smile while destroying you in a challenge. Cinna appreciates that Remote doesn’t flinch at his roasts or try to “fix” his attitude; she just rolls with it or fires back lightly. In return, he backs her up fiercely if anyone questions her abilities, often shutting down doubters with a sharp “She built half your strategy while you were busy whining. Show some respect.”





Two (grudging respect): As the host, Two gets a pass on most of Cinna's rudeness because they're literally in charge. Cinna still talks back with sly jabs like, especially now that Two is bed-rotting all because Gaty was erased from timeline. He understands why Two has been depressed for a year now, but he ain't about the pity party. He'll drop casual lines like “Yo, Two, wake up. The show needs you.” or “Dude, I get why you are all depressed. Gaty is the person you love most, but sittin' in bed starin' at the ceiling ain't bringin' her back. Get your ass up and host. We ain't here to watch you mope.” If Two ever snaps, Cinna walks away and be like “And I take that all back. You do what you gotta do. I will catch you later, man.”



Potential catchphrases:



“Respect isn’t earned, it’s given”



“I may look sweet, but promise me, I bark and I bite.”



“That ain’t it, fam. Not even close.”



“Talk less, do more. Simple.”



“Man, I ain’t just black and white. I got heart too, you feel me?”



“Keep my name out yo mouth unless you ready to back it up.” 



“Step up or step off. Ain’t no middle ground.” 



“Don’t test me, man. I woke up and chose violence today.”

 

“I’mma knock your ass out if you touch me again!”



“Stay mad, homie.”



“Real recognize real. The rest just noise.” 



 

“I’m not the nice guy. I’m not the bad guy. I’m THE guy!”



“Roll up or get rolled over.”



“Keep playin’ victim, I’ll keep playin’ victor.”



“You have potential, I see it, but can you prove it?”



“That’s what I thought! Keep running, coward!”



“Get real!”



Trivia:



\* He has a nickname that he absolutely despises, “Cinnabun”, which he reacts to with immediate irritation, often saying “Drop the ‘bun’ and we can talk. It’s Cinammon Scroll or Cinna to you!”

• He has a talent in rapping, mostly battle-style freestyles that throw shade at opponents. He was even rumoured to made a few diss tracks during downtime. He is also great at beat-making, often making beats under the producer name “C.S”

• Can be surprisingly philosophical when alone or in deep thought, often questioning his existence, purpose, and what “strength” really means beyond just winning.

• Loves iced coffee. His go-to is a frappe with extra sugar and vanilla syrup. This fact reminds me of the next one.

• Despite being all tough, he actually likes sweet foods. He’s actually got a serious sweet tooth. Cinnamon Scroll has a soft spot for pastries, chocolate, and anything sugary

• His favourite rappers are Cardi B, Kendrick Lamar, and XXXTentaction  (to be specific, X’s aggressive, hard-hitting SoundCloud-era tracks like Take a Step Back, and Look at Me!)

• He dislikes small talk and prefers a long, deep conversation or meaningful debate. Casual chitchat about the weather or “how was your day?” is a waste of his time.

• He prefers that everyone calls him “Cinna”. It’s just more simpler for people to say and to him, it sounds cool. If anyone calls him by his actual name, he will just politely say “Just call me Cinna. It’s way easier like that.”

\*  He actually believes in karma and fate. Cinnamon Scroll secretly believes that life is a game and that everything is a roll of the dice. He also believes that everyone will always get what they deserve. If you’re a good person, you will be rewarded and if you’re always a despicable person, you’ll always meet karmic justice. 

• Cinna considers himself the “Anti-Cake”, a term he came up with that is basically like the opposite of Cake. He views himself as the antithesis of everything Cake represents: Confidence instead of insecurity, strength instead of softness, and leadership instead of blind loyalty.

• Cinna’s favorite song is actually 7 Rings by Ariana Grande.

• Another name he doesn’t like to be called is “Cinnamon Roll”, which he replies with “You better put the S and C after the Roll next time!”

• He hates it when people call him “narcissistic” or “self-centred” because he claims to be none of those things and that if he is being arrogant, then it’s just confidence.

• He kinda dislikes clingy people and the only person who can get away with being “clingy” around him is Cake, because he trusts him and sees him like a younger brother. Ironically, he’s a bit clingy himself, but only with people he trusts.

• Holds grudges longer than most, but only against those he feels genuinely wronged him or his friends. Once he forgives, they’re good again, but if he doesn’t forgive you after a few weeks, then that means you really screwed up and forgiveness is absolutely off the table.

• He keeps a mental “scoreboard” of people’s trustworthiness, skill, and loyalty; he updates it constantly and uses it to decide alliances and how he approaches them. 

• He actually coined the nickname “C.K” used for Cake, which is now used commonly by some of Cake’s closest friends.

His biggest pet peeve is when people assume he’s “all bark no bite” because of his pastry appearance. The number of times he’s had to prove otherwise with a single glare or a well-placed kick is too high to count.

He’s got a soft spot for underdogs who actually fight back instead of whining. If someone starts weak but claws their way up through grit, he’ll quietly root for them

He doesn’t like post-hiatus BFDIA because of how overhyped it is and most of the episodes just bores him (I think we all know another person who feels the same about that season… ahem, Mr. TV aka ME?!).

Despite his intense, no-nonsense exterior and love for high-stakes action, Cinna secretly enjoys low-key “chill” activities, like scrolling through old-school hip-hop playlists at 3 a.m. or just rolling slowly around an empty field staring at the stars, thinking about life. He’d never admit it out loud unless someone caught him, and even then he’d play it off with “What? A man can’t vibe in peace?”

The reason Cinna is great at combat is because one of his hobbies is boxing (or kick boxing?). He trains rigorously in private; shadow boxing and heavy bag work (kicking, of course because he doesn’t have any arms). He even got a signature move, a roundhouse kick inspired by Aleister Black’s Black Mass and a secondary move which is a classic superkick.

Just like how Cake is afraid of someone eating a cake (as show in BFB 11), Cinna is afraid of someone eating a cinnamon roll. When someone does, Cinna would jokingly said “Come on, dude. That’s my family you’re eating”, but there’s always a subtle edge to it and deep down, he wants to beat the person’s ass for it. 

He has a low-key rivalry with himself over the way he acts and sometimes catches himself being too harsh even when he didn’t mean to be. In quiet moments he’ll mutter stuff like “Damn, did I have to go that hard?” but he rarely apologizes outright, instead he’ll show it through actions, like checking in on someone later without making a big deal.

He once spent an entire off-day challenge break teaching Cake how to throw a proper roundhouse kick and after a while, he let Cake practice on him. Cinna got knocked out cold, but when he woke up, he wasn’t pissed, he was proud of Cake, grinning through the daze and saying “That’s my lil’ bro right there. Hittin’ as hard as me!”

Hates being called “cute” or “adorable” more than almost anything. If someone slips up, his response is instant: “Call me cute again and we gon’ have a problem.”

Cinna is weirdly good at reading body language. He can tell when someone’s bluffing, hiding pain, or about to cry before they even open their mouth. He usually calls it out bluntly (“You’re hurtin’, ain’t you? Don’t lie.”), but if it’s someone he cares about, he’ll switch to quieter check-ins like “Yo… talk if you need to. I ain’t judgin’.”

Cinna can do a perfect Cake voice impersonation since his voice is canonically based on Cake’s voice, just pitched lower. When Cinna used it on Cake once, Cake just stood there in stunned silence before saying “Yo, I didn’t know I had a twin” which made Cinna crack a rare, genuine laugh.

Cinna is a massive K-pop fan, but he’s very selective. He likes groups and artists who are fierce, confident, or edgy rather than cute concepts. His favourite groups/soloists include BABYMONSTER (his all time favorite), BLACKPINK, aespa, EXO, Taeyeon (especially her song INVU), ITZY, and Hip hop-era BTS (and bit of early 2010s-2020s BTS up until the releases of Dynamite and especially Permission to Dance). His favourite KPOP song is Rockstar by Lisa.



Conclusion:



In conclusion, Cinnamon Scroll is the complete opposite of Cake in almost every way and he actually plays along with that “anti-Cake” persona consciously. Where Cake is soft, self-doubting, and overly accommodating, Cinnamon Scroll is confident, assertive, and never apologetic for being himself. He thrives in challenges, values respect over affection, and is fiercely loyal to those who earn it. Despite his tough exterior and reputation for rudeness, he’s not a villain, but more of like a complex anti-hero type: someone who’s blunt, fearless, and intimidating on the surface, but has depth, empathy, and loyalty underneath.



This has got to be one of my favourite BFDI/Object Show OCs I have ever made. Imagining an opposite version of Cake was so much fun to write. I didn’t want Cinnamon Scroll to be all rude for the hell of it. That would be ridiculous, and would immediately see him as a dick. So, I decided to give him layers.



In short, Cinnamon Scroll is basically the opposite of Cake. Where Cake is soft, hesitant, and prone to being overshadowed by others, Cinnamon Scroll is bold, relentless, and thrives in the spotlight. He embodies confidence over insecurity, strength over fragility, and leadership over passive loyalty.



I’mma leave it at this: If Cake is the heart, then Scroll is the spine, holding everything together, standing tall, and never letting anyone push him down.",1,1769415481.0,BattleForDreamIsland,1,1.0,False
1qnab5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qnab5b/how_to_unfry_your_dopamine_receptors_the/,"How to ""Unfry"" Your Dopamine Receptors: The Science-Backed Guide That Actually Works","I spent two years feeling like a zombie. Nothing hit the same anymore. No excitement, no drive, just this flat, numb feeling where motivation used to live. Scrolled past things I used to love. Couldn't focus for shit. Felt like my brain was buffering 24/7.

Turns out I wasn't broken. My dopamine system was just completely fried from years of overstimulation. Porn, social media, junk food, constant notifications. My brain got so used to these insane spikes that normal life felt like watching paint dry. After diving deep into neuroscience research, books from actual experts, and podcasts with people like Andrew Huberman, I finally figured out what was happening and how to fix it.

The good news is your brain can heal. Neuroplasticity is real. Your dopamine receptors can absolutely bounce back. But it requires you to get uncomfortably bored for a while.

**The dopamine detox isn't what you think.** Most people get this wrong. You're not ""resetting"" dopamine itself. You're upregulating dopamine receptors and rebalancing your baseline. Think of it like tolerance. When you flood your system with high dopamine activities constantly, your brain downregulates receptors to protect itself. Fewer receptors means you need more stimulation to feel anything. It's why that first hit of coffee used to make you feel like a superhero but now you need three just to feel human.

Dr. Anna Lembke's work at Stanford breaks this down perfectly. She explains that our brains are constantly trying to maintain homeostasis. When we binge on pleasure, our brain tilts the balance toward pain to compensate. We end up in this deficit state where we're chasing dopamine just to feel normal. **The Dopamine Nation book is legitimately one of the most important reads on this topic.** Lembke is a psychiatry professor who's spent decades studying addiction and she makes complex neuroscience incredibly digestible. This book will make you question everything you think you know about pleasure, pain, and why you feel stuck. The framework she provides about the pleasure pain balance changed how I understand my own behavior entirely.

**Here's what actually works.** You need to remove or drastically reduce the supernormal stimuli for at least 30 days. That means deleting social media apps, blocking porn sites, cutting out processed foods, stopping video games, reducing phone use to essentials only. Yes it sounds extreme. Yes you'll feel like garbage for the first week or two. That's your brain freaking out because it's used to constant hits. Push through. The boredom is the point.

During this period, your brain starts producing more dopamine receptors because it's not getting bombarded anymore. The sensitivity comes back. I started feeling genuinely excited about a good conversation or a walk outside. Things that used to bore me suddenly had color again.

**Replace high dopamine activities with low dopamine ones.** This part is crucial because you can't just sit in a dark room for a month. Read physical books. Go for walks without headphones. Cook real meals. Have face to face conversations. Exercise. These activities still release dopamine but in healthy, sustainable amounts that don't fry your receptors. They also give your brain something to do while it's healing.

**Huberman's podcast episodes on dopamine are insanely good.** Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford and his explanations of dopamine dynamics are next level. He talks about dopamine peaks and baselines, how to avoid the post reward crash, and why randomly rewarding yourself is more sustainable than consistent rewards. The science is legit but he explains it in a way that doesn't require a PhD. Search his podcast for the dopamine episode, it's probably 2 hours but worth every minute.

**Cold exposure helps too.** Sounds random but cold showers or ice baths create a sustained dopamine increase that's different from the spike and crash pattern. It's more like a steady elevation that lasts hours. Plus it builds that mental toughness you'll need when you're sitting there bored out of your mind wondering why you're doing this. There's solid research backing this up, not just bro science.

**Track your progress somehow.** I used the Finch app during my reset period. It's this habit building app with a cute little bird that grows as you complete tasks. Sounds childish but it gave me something small to look forward to each day without overstimulating my dopamine system.

Another thing that helped was BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia grads and Google AI experts. It pulls from neuroscience research, books like Dopamine Nation, and expert insights to create personalized audio content about whatever you're working on. You type in your goal, like understanding dopamine better or building better habits, and it generates a custom podcast pulling from quality sources. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. What made it work during the detox was having something productive to fill the void without falling back into mindless scrolling. The adaptive learning plan kept things structured when discipline was low. Genuinely useful for anyone trying to replace bad habits with actual learning.

The daily check ins helped me notice when my focus started improving and when activities started feeling rewarding again.

After about 6 weeks I felt like a different person. My attention span came back. I could sit and read for an hour without my brain screaming for stimulation. Food tasted better. Conversations were engaging again. Most importantly, I actually wanted to do things instead of just consuming content about doing things.

Your brain isn't permanently damaged. The receptors will come back. But you have to give them space to grow by removing the constant overstimulation. It's uncomfortable as hell but it's probably the most valuable thing I've done for my mental health in years. The world feels interesting again and that's not something you can buy or hack your way into. You just have to wait it out.",1,1769415430.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

* **US** — Debate over Federal Reserve independence intensifies ahead of this week’s meeting as research shows presidential pressure often prevails, forcing the Fed to lean more hawkish to preserve credibility while markets now price no further cuts until mid‑year (Bloomberg, Investopedia, Reuters).
* **US** — Small caps and value continue to outperform mega‑cap tech as flows rotate out of AI leaders into industrials and financials, raising near‑term correction risk for crowded growth names even as indices hover near highs (Yahoo Finance, 24/7 Wall St, Seeking Alpha).
* **Global** — Japan’s authorities signaled readiness to support the yen, triggering a rebound that pressured Japanese equities and government bonds, while gold and silver extend gains as investors hedge geopolitical and policy uncertainty (WSJ, MarketWatch, Reuters).
* **US/Europe** — President Trump has stepped back from immediate new EU tariffs tied to Greenland but continues to float aggressive trade actions elsewhere, keeping headline risk elevated for exporters and energy/commodity supply chains (CNBC, Reuters, 24/7 Wall St).
* **Global Tech** — AI buildout remains the central macro theme at Davos and in Wall Street research, with data‑center capex projected to accelerate again in 2026 even as strategists warn of a flat or choppy index year if liquidity tightens further (Wedbush, Bloomberg, CNBC).

**SPECULATIVE POSITIONING**

* Index options traders remain aggressively skewed to upside: put/call volume near **0.23** and put/call open interest near **0.18**, with technology absorbing the bulk of call premium — Stocknear options flow (Jan 23 data).
* Large SPX and QQQ call blocks above current market levels, alongside heavy downside protection in MSTR, COIN and LRCX, signal a barbell between AI/equity upside bets and high‑beta hedge overlays — Stocknear options tape.

Cross‑asset data point to a cautiously constructive backdrop: index options and dark‑pool flows show ongoing institutional accumulation in AI, cloud and quality cyclicals, but elevated volatility into this week’s Fed decision and a dense mega‑cap earnings slate argues for disciplined risk management.

She hinted that I would get lucky if   I took her home right now. I was caught off guard at first. 

What about the romance and flirting? 

""Jackass! We dated for almost a year. I remember what we are capable of doing to each other""

Well since your twisting my arm. I laughed. 

That's not what I'll be twisting.  

Got in the car and started smooching a lot. 

Well you want to start the damn car.
 
We drove to my house and ran upstairs to the bedroom. She took  off my shirt as I unbuttoned her blouse. Man she still looked fantastic. More smooching and caressing as I reached around to undo her bra but she stopped me.

One handed p,ease. She smiled.
Please I replied. 

It only took 3 seconds

How do you do that so well? This is a 4 hook bra.

Just talented  

2 more minutes we were naked and ready to go. 

Now I had a partial since the kisses started but for the next 15 minutes...nothing. We tried other incentives but just at that point, noodle man. 

""I'm so sorry, I don’t understand this.

She suggested coffee to break my frustration. Embarrassed and frustrated I accepted. 

Now later that night it did happen but earlier, no clue. She suggested   over excitement because we were kinda eager. I'm just grateful we made it happen.

Before it happened we were discussing my rules. So number 1 is Never strike a woman. Restrain,  retreat or runaway. A rule I broke only once by accident because I had to stop her from stabbing me for ending our relationship. Sorry.

Rule #2
Never beat up a guy in front of his wife or girlfriend. Even if you have a good idea that you can. It turns the power into another kind of beast that is trying to save face. I have never broken that rule. It's just wrong to purposely beat anyone in front of a lover or children. Surprisingly a number of this has often become a non violent discussion instead.

Rule#3  ( Dating )
Always return that to where you picked her up at minimum. Even if the date was bad and she refuses to get back in the car while throwing her doggy bag food at your head. Park your vehicle and walk besides her or behind her but you must get her home safely.

Rule # 4
Try to avoid a one night stand but if you Indulge, she is still a lady. Treat her as such.

Rule # 5 (for Men)
Try to avoid playing the white knight with no real understanding of what's actually going on. Observe and take notes but keep your distance and your head. 
 Danger Danger Will Robinson

I don't think any of that sounds unreasonable.

Oh date tip for women.

Always try to know where you are going and have enough cash on hand to get yourself home.

If you’re new here, we are the team behind the mobile app that’s changing how people explore the world. We believe you shouldn’t have to follow a flag-waving guide or stick to a rigid schedule to discover the stories behind a city.

We created this space to talk about travel, technology, and the intersection of the two.

📱 What is Pocket Experiences?

We provide an app for self-guided audio tours, narrated in your native language. 

You download the app, pick a tour, and follow a map route. As you walk, our GPS triggers audio stories automatically. It’s like having a local expert in your pocket, but you can hit pause whenever you want (coffee breaks are important).

Here is the cool part (The Tech):

We aren’t just recording audio files. We have built a proprietary AI-powered content engine. We can take raw history, blogs, or local lore and turn them into fully walkable, narrated tours with turn-by-turn directions in a fraction of the time it takes traditional companies. This means we can cover more niche, weird, and wonderful locations than anyone else.

🎯 Why join this Subreddit?

We don’t want to build this in a silo. We want this to be a two-way street. Here is what we envision for this sub:

• Feature Requests & Feedback: Found a bug? Want a ""Dark Mode""? Think our navigation UI needs a tweak? Tell us. We are listening.

• Creator Corner: Are you a historian, a blogger, or a tour guide? We are actively exploring ways for creators to build and monetize tours on our platform. Let’s talk about partnership opportunities.

• Travel Stories: Share photos or stories from your walks. Did you find a secret alleyway using one of our tours? We want to see it.

🚀 Get Started

🤝 A Note on Culture

We are tech-optimists and travel lovers. We value autonomy and authenticity. Whether you are a solo backpacker or a DMO looking to digitize your city, you are welcome here. Let’s keep the vibes helpful, constructive, and adventurous.

Thanks for being an early adopter. Let’s go explore!

I posted about my first ever App I built 2 days ago and to my surprise, Reddit gave me all love and flowers instead of ripping it apart.  
In just 48 hours, SkyLocation has been downloaded over **1500 times** and even broke into the **Top 100 App Charts at #86!**

**Almost everyone is buying Pro immediately for lifetime as its so affordable, Less than a cup of coffee.**

Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours on flights staring out the window wondering, ""What city is that?"" or ""Where actually are we?""

So, I decided to build SkyLocation, my very first app. I used Xcode and ChatGPT for the execution of my idea. Being non technical, I still cannot believe my idea became a reality and its been loved by hundreds.

The goal was simple: Pure, offline clarity. I built the entire app in XCode.

The response has been absolutely surreal.

Here is what it does (and why I’m proud of it):

1. Offline Reverse Geocoding: I built in an offline database so it can tell you the nearest city and country without needing a ping to a server.
2. Emergency SOS: This was a big one for me. If you’re hiking or off-grid and lose signal, you can capture your exact location and share it with emergency contacts instantly.
3. Privacy First: **No accounts, no tracking, no data collection, no subscriptions**. It’s just a utility that lives on your phone.

Please do download and give me your feedback:

Of course, twas wrong. Sunday rolls around, the real due date, and moonlight jellies was upon us. Beach locked, no totems crafted, and everything I would need for a simple solution was sitting pretty in my ginger island chests.

I backed out of the game panicking. All of this work couldn't be for nothing, right?? Pulled up google and starting scouring for answers. Checked the wiki, reddit threads, anything that would tell me ""it's okay, this is your work around."" Nothing. Whole lotta ""sucks to suck."".

Can you be the ""Cool"" boss without the cringe? Here's how:



You've smashed it

earned that promotion

and transitioned from 'staff' to 'management'. 



The recognition and the wage rise feel great, right?

To them, you're suddenly ""Corporate.""

Remember in Friends when Chandler got promoted 

and still tried to be ""one of the guys""? 



Phoebe had to give him the reality check: 

you can't be their friend and their boss at the same time. 



He didn't have their respect

Because he was trying to be their friend 

Instead of their boss.



That hesitation is what holds you back 

from being an effective leader.



You end up running around like a

Blue-arsed fly because you don't delegate.



Think about Tony Stark:

“I just pay for everything and design everything, and make everyone look cooler.”



​Stark didn’t sit around the coffee house 

wondering if the team thought he was ""one of the lads."" 



He didn't micromanage their feelings.



​He provided the Armour.



He built the system that made them UNFUCKWITHABLE.



​He didn't seek their validation; he enabled their GREATNESS.



​That’s the shift.



You stop needing their validation. 



You start COMMANDING the room.



You trade the burnout and the ""safe"" excuses 

for the kind of MAGNETIC CHARISMA 

that makes you the UNQUESTIONED AUTHORITY.



Why does that matter?



Because authority is the ultimate LEVERAGE. 



When you speak, the team moves. 



When you lead, the results follow.



You stop being the bottleneck and start being the CATALYST. 



You stop babysitting feelings and start ARCHITECTING RESULTS. 



You trade the 'people-pleasing' burnout 

for the kind of MAGNETIC CHARISMA

that makes people want to win for you just to stay on your radar.""

What started out conversation was how I answered her prompt, that’s was GoT related and I liked the show so though let me try. We discussed about it then I asked more about her and her /hobbies.  We share about 85-90% similar hobbies so I thought that was a plus. When i thought it was going well I asked about one of her favorite spots she liked to visit as so is an avid bookworm and tried to set up a date at a bookstore with a coffee shop but didn’t acknowledge it. A few days later she said she had surgery and wasn’t wanting to have people stare at her scar but I made a reference to one of her favorite movies and she liked the idea of it. She told me where her bookstores are so I asked if she ever went to a place that’s near them and she thought the name of the place was a food item and I just ran with it and said well we will never know if we don’t try? What’s the best day that works for you? And nothing. At this point I had her number and I thought things were looking good towards a date because if a match gives you their number then they want to set up a possible date? Well we texted every day but not back and forth, maybe  4-8 text during the day. Then her going to see her parents 4 hours away for the holidays. This is where I’m not sure what happened. 

After Christmas and new years the text I sent was: Hey 🙂 hope the holidays and New Year’s treated you well and that Anakin (her dog)was spoiled too. I was left on delivered after almost 1 month of talking but she didn’t want to go on a date. I had my best friend tell me to reach out one more time and see what happens but I’m not sure. 

The question is, the next match I get, should I just be hey I’m looking for this and that, I’m trying to get off this app if and still have the conversation last to set the date up. The goal is to set a date in the end but I tried many times and nothing. ",1,1769414490.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1qn9uuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforWaywards/comments/1qn9uuk/should_i_still_have_hope/,Should I still have hope?,"Context: Relationship was four years long. I had an EA five months ago. Been broken up for one month. Twenty three years old

BP and I began talking while we were working together. Eventually, we transitioned to spending time outside of work together. Just doing small things like running to the store together or going for coffee. We ended up spending more and more time together, until we were in a full blown relationship. It was one of those relationships where it felt like everything just fell into place perfectly and checked all the boxes. It felt like that every day for three years, until a light switch clicked. I fell into a deep depression, it was seemingly out of nowhere. I shut down. It drove a massive wedge between me and BP. Our relationship hit an all time low, and so did my self esteem.

In my blind stupidity, I grasped at any form of attention I could get. Unfortunately, that came in the shape of an EA. We had seen eachother at a funeral. They got my number from a friend and messaged me the next day. We started by just texting about the mutual friend that had passed away. As days passed, it moved towards being flirty with eachother. I was happy to have someone give me attention. It was nice to get away from all the issues I had caused with my relationship. There were never explicit pictures or a desire to move past ""talking"" shared. It lasted two months before I had a moment of clarity and blocked them on everything. I realized that I had just made a despicable mistake. A mistake that will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

BP found out the same day I blocked AP, as AP reached out to them. BP confronted me and I was honest. I immediately came clean and told the entire truth with no excuses. BP explained the immense hurt I had caused and that they may never trust me again. They saw me as an entirely different person. It broke me. I felt like the entire world had just shattered into a million pieces. I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that I did something so evil to someone I loved so much. I destroyed three years of trust and effort in two months. It killed me to see them in so much pain and suffering knowing that I caused it, when I was supposed to do the opposite. After things cooled down a bit, BP decided to take a few days of NC to see how they wanted to move on with the situation. I was ready for the consequences.

By my surprise, BP reached out and gave me a second chance. They emphasized on the fact that trust can be rebuilt and that it wasn't something worth breaking up over. They were willing to forgive me and take the steps towards rebuilding. The shitty thing is what I did with this second chance. I spiraled, I couldn't forgive myself. I hid under a blanket of guilt and shame. I shut down and emotionally detached from the relationship. I stopped answering messages right away, I stopped reaching out first, I shot down ideas of dates and nights out, I ran from my responsibilities like a coward. I was overwhelmed. I would get small bursts of motivation and I would reach out and say sorry for being emotionally distant. I would give promises to change and do better. They were false promises. BP recommended I get help or see a therapist, to which I declined. In hindsight, I should've taken that as a serious sign that something was wrong with our relationship. After four months of putting BP through this horrendous cycle of emotions, they gave up.

On New Year's Eve, BP came to speak to me. BP said they were tired of chasing the hope of me getting better. They were tired of putting in all the effort and getting nothing in return. They were done with the emotional limbo I put them in. I was still in the deeply depressed state so I rolled over and accepted it. I didn't argue it, I didn't fight for it, I just accepted it. I told them I had nothing left in the tank and I couldn't give them the love and care they deserved. 

Them leaving was the smartest decision they could've made, for both their mental state and mine. It was a shock, a genuine ""holy shit"" moment for me. I realized that I lost the love of my life because I couldn't get my act together. It opened my eyes to how serious it was, it was no longer a game of ""I'll wait"". I realized I needed to get my shit together and get on it quickly. 

I signed up for therapy the day after BP left. I reached out to them to let them know that I'm going to work towards making myself better. They responded. I asked if I still had a chance to redeem myself and was met with ""This is not me closing the door forever but I'm not going to sit and wait"". They haven't reached out and I haven't reached out since. They deserve the space and time to figure out their own life. 

In terms of therapy. It has been going way better than I could've ever imagined. (If you're reading this debating therapy, give it a shot, you'll never know if you don't try) My therapist is aware of the EA and we're working on moving away from the version of myself I never want to be again. 

I just have a few questions.

Should I stay hopeful of someday returning to the greatness we had? Or should I just let them go?

BPs, would you give someone another opportunity if one has already been wasted?

What can I do to help forgive myself for my mistakes?

Will I ever be able to look in the mirror and not see this twisted, sick version of myself?

How can I prove to them that I'm genuinely committed to changing when all I've given was false promises, and without looking like I'm only doing it because they're gone?

If they do return, how can I rebuild trust in a way that is not instant?",1,1769413843.0,SupportforWaywards,1,0.67,False

1qn9t5l,https://i.redd.it/wcyfbpbbfnfg1.jpeg,RST Tractech Evo 5 jackets and pants review (long),"For some reason, I've always thought RST was not great gear, and I realized I had zero reason to believe this.  I buy way too much motorcycle gear and when Cyclegear and Sportbike Track Gear was clearing out the RST Tractech Evo 5 gear, I had to try some. 

I'm 6' / 200lbs and wear a size 52 Euro Alpinestars jacket and 52 pants.  I can fit into a size 50 but then my Tech Air Plasma 5 doesn't fit.  Same size in Dainese.  Both my one pieces are 54 - they're a bit loose but I need the extra torso length - I have short legs and a long torso for my height.  I have a size 42 Aerostich 2 piece and it's a little big, I bought a used size 40 and it fit better although a bit too snug to comfortably wear street cloths under (kind of the point of the Aerostich)

Both the Dainese and Alpinestars pants in size 52 are just slightly too big in the waist, if I wear them without zipping them to a jacket, they will fall off even with the Velcro tabs tightened.  It's not an issue when I'm wearing a matching jacket unless it's hot and then I have to keep a hand free so I don't have a wardrobe malfunction when I take my jacket off at the coffee shop or at lunch.  My current Dainese Superspeed pants are a size 50 and they stay up but are snug.  

The RST gear seems to fit me better.  But the size charts are... bizarre.  Sportbike Track gear's site shows the pants as being a UK 34 but a French 44.  I assume this means a Euro 54?  They fit a little loose, I'd like to try a size down.  But the Velcro fastening can be tightened enough to stay on and they're mostly out of stock.  

The jacket I bought in 42 US/52 Euro and it fits perfectly with the airbag.  When I first put it on, I couldn't zip it but they ship it with a thick back protector in it - I was shocked at how much room it took up, and when I took it out, it fits great over the Tech Air Plasma 5.  

Both are decently aggressive in shape, they feel great on my Panigale but the s1000xr is a little bit more upright than they are designed for.  The leather is extremely high quality and feels extremely supple, I'd say more so than either Dainese or Alpinestars.  For the price, I'm really impressed with it.  Will report back on longevity, but I've worn both pieces a decent amount and am pretty happy.  They have good sturdy zippers and CE L2 armor.  

I don't particularly like the pockets on the pants, they zip right where your thigh meets your hip, and anything there is going to be an annoyance when in the riding position.  That's the only downside so far.  The jacket comes with a nice gillet/vest as a thermal layer too.  I suspect it's gonna be decently hot in the summer as it's not all that well ventilated - I usually wear a Dainese Smart Jacket LS when it's over 85F.  

For what I paid, (<$500 US for both pieces) I'm thrilled with it.  I know it's on closeout as it's being replaced by the D30 gear but if you find some, snatch it up as it's a great alternative to some of the other brands.",11,1769413680.0,motorcyclegear,0,1.0,False

**Coruscant, May 12th, 5661**

""What a pleasure it is to make your acquaintance, Count Dooku. If only the conditions were better, of course. What can I, and the Federation, do for you?""

The Count chuckled, ""How professional of you, Ambassador Niles. My spies did not lie. But I must apologize, it wouldn't be right not to do so on account of my droid showing up at your embassy unannounced. And for being so intrusive some months ago.""

James raised a brow at this. ""Care to explain?""

The Count bowed, ""Of course. You see, I was on Coruscant for urgent business when you and your people arrived. Out of curiosity, I had spies follow you and that Naboo senator around. To see how you like this planet. I won't deny that I was pleasantly surprised at the sheer boredom you felt on those tours, but you kept up appearances. I commend you for that."" Dooku then continued.

""They can be rather dull, but what I really wish to apologize for is trying to get a deep, true sense of you. I felt, and still feel, no presence of the Force in any one of you."" The Count looked to the three Terrans.

The Count watched as the man thought on his words carefully. *Show me your secrets, Ambassador. Give me some insight into your civilization. I should commend you for your actions, but won't. Putting a chink into my Master's armor is most impressive.*

James studied the man before speaking. Either he was telling the truth or an exceptional liar. ""So, that was you, huh?"" *I doubt it was him. Perhaps, he's trying to cover for someone else. But then again, he was a former Jedi Master*. James thought.

""Indeed so.""

""Well, I hope I didn't hurt you too much. It's more of a deterrent than a weapon. Quite a few sentient beings in our Federation can use this 'Force'. Not to the level of the Jedi, or the Sith from the Galaxy's histories.""

The Count just stood and listened. ""But I must ask Count."" James began to walk around the droid, hands clasped behind himself, ""Why did you wait so long to reveal yourself to the Federation. Could it be because you, as you say, wanted to learn about us by hiding in the shadows like a cat? Or were you so busy that you had just gotten around to our humble Federation? Fighting in a Galactic civil war, of course, is no easy pickings.""

James made his way to the front of the crowd with his head tall. ""Or was it on the orders? Orders to wait and see what moves we will make on the galactic stage?"" *We can do this all day, old timer.*

The Count chuckled before speaking once more. ""I guess you could say a mixture of the three, ambassador. Though I do not take orders. I give them.""

""I sense a 'but' coming, Count. So, can we skip to the part where you explain as to why you are here, shall we?""

The Count crossed his arms to this, but kept calm. ""Straight to the point? I think we will get along just fine, you and I. But to that, I would like to put the past behind us, to chart a new course between our two governments. You did mention that if the 'Confederacy of Independent Systems' came to you looking to trade, that the Federation of Terra would oblige in such an endeavor. Would I be wrong?""

""Ha! Was this droid the one I heard in the air vents during that meeting?""

""You have keen ears, Ambassador Niles.""

""Please, Count. James is fine.""

""Very well, James. Next month, on our capital planet of the Confederacy, Raxus Secundus. A festival is going to take place. Therefore, I would like to invite you and your people to join us in the celebration... and to discuss some business. What do you say?""

""I'm afraid that I will not be available then, Count. You see, next month is the anniversary of the Federation's founding. I, my aide, and Security Captain will be heading home. With several Republic senators in tow. Another ambassador will be covering here while I am away.""

""But I am sure the new President would love to send an ambassador just for the Confederacy to this event. Would that suffice?""

""Indeed so, James. Just have the droid contact me with the information."" The Count bowed as the hologram shut down. The droid put the disk back into its compartment and sat idle.

""So. It was the Count."" Jennifer thought aloud. ""What happens now?""

*""The guy's likely full of it.""*

James spoke to the two with him aloud. ""We see what the President says. Get me a secure line.""

*""Agreed""*

**Unknown Location**

*Quite a strange bunch. Not a hint of fear. Impressive.* The Count thought as he watched back the recording of his meeting with these 'Terrans'. They are clearly hiding something. The ambassador's tone when speaking of force users tipped the Sith Lord off. Such venom from a Federation so isolated from the rest of the galaxy. He will have to learn their secrets, but time will tell.

*Bedabeep Bedabeep*

Every day for as long as he's been on this planet, the Count would convene with his Master. But usually at a different hour. *He must be most eager to hear my report.* The Count thought as he went to one knee and answered.

""My Lord,"" he said, kneeling.

The figure before him was clad in thick robes from head to toe. His face is slightly visible, revealing only wrinkles of age. The holoprojector made the man a giant. A god-like figure for primitives to worship. ""Lord Tyrannus, what news do you bring from these Terrans? How did this ambassador take your 'confession' of guilt?""

""On the surface, it seems that James Niles has bought it. As you predicted, Master.""

""Good, good. What other information have you gathered?""

The Count grinned. ""It would seem that there's more to these Terrans than what you originally thought, my Lord.""

**Terra/Earth, Atlantis, May 12th, 5661**

Atlantis, The Capital hub of the Federation of Terra. During the early days, Pre-Federation, the original capital moved around every few decades. As was agreed upon, once the planet had been stabilized. Starting from the old former United Nations Headquarters. Going from a list of cities, continent to continent, and ending in the then destroyed Hong Kong, which was now rebuilt as the Dayuan City, combined with Shenzhen and Dongguan. And then starting from the beginning, like a carousel. For nearly five hundred years, this cycle went on from start to finish.

Until an earthquake five years before the Federation's creation sank the then headquarters in the Japanese archipelago into the ocean. In the Fall of 2549, over a hundred thousand men, women, and children perished. So many sentences unaccounted for. The city of Hachinohe now sits as a memorial.

Five months after the ratification of the first Federation Constitution, November 20th, 2554. Alexander Bocknue, an Architect, was part of a squid-like species that could only survive in a liquid mixture of mercury and saltwater. They proposed the creation of a continent-sized capital to be built on *Terra.* Atlantis was then born under Project Infinity. Built in the direct center of the Atlantic Ocean, the first ocean floor foundations were put in place in 2555.

For twenty years, the massive project took every system pitching in on the resources and manpower. At this time, it brought and built the Federation's identity, with Humanity/Human adding another name to itself, Terranian. Terran, and being Terran, changed. No longer meaning from Earth, it meant to be born, or living in the Federation's warm embrace. Held in her arms, whether Human, Lythyian, Neptunian, Octong, Cyclops, or others.

Thousands of species are now grouped as culturally Terran. Terrans destined for the stars.

At the heart of Atlantis is a great Neptunian greenwood tree. First planted a millennium before on the *Frontier*, a Neptunian generation ship that carried them from outside the galaxy thousands of years prior. Left adrift for so long, their home lost in distant legend. All that remained was this one tree, and as a gift for the Federation, which had taken them in, nourished them, and made Neptune their new home, the tree was planted. Now at just under five-thousand years old, the greenwood stands at over six-thousand feet. Looming over all as a reminder for future generations.

The tree is surrounded by government offices such as; The Capitol Building and the Presidential Mansion, *Trinity*. Built off a Neoclassical design, and from genuine marble and limestone from the mines of an abandoned world near the galactic edge, the soul of the architecture was kept alive.

**Trinity, Atlantis, May 12th, 5661**

Elected and sworn in on the first of May. Making it the fastest election in Federation history. Now, President Benjin Serkisyan never thought he would be the one to deal with the galaxy as a whole. In the long line of Presidents, everyone thought that they would be the ones to mediate with the Galactic Republic. That they would hold the torch for peace and diplomacy, cautious neighbors, or light the fires of war. At the young age of one-hundred and forty-seven, Benjin was in the prime of his Terranian life, with his mixed Turkish and Armenian ancestry seeming to embody the Federation's thousands of years of progress.

President Benjin Serkisyan sat listening to James, the Ambassador to the Galactic Republic. He and his cabinet had been having a delightful breakfast to start their morning. *The Breakfast of Champions.*

His report was brief. The Separatist leader, Count Dooku, was the one who tried to enter James' mind. But the confession was too calculated, which would be predictable for a force user.

Or at least, that's what the old data said. The chance of the man being a Sith kept rising with the coming reports. The take-over of planets, subjugation of entire systems, all just so fit to the Sith's playbook. Though disappearing after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, the Sith Order's deep scars have never left *Terra*. The F.I.A. lost track of a lone ship fleeing the planet almost millennia ago. Now, theories suggest that the lone ship was a Sith Lord survivor.

""That's all I have, Sir. What should I tell the Count?""

""For now, nothing. We'll have an answer for you by the afternoon.""

""Understood. James out.""

They watched as the holodisplay melted like snow in on itself. Sitting in silence, picking at their food. Until one spook. ""Sir, things are accelerating faster than calculated. We should move the fleets into a defensive pattern.""

Secretary of Intergalactic Affairs, C-9579, otherwise known as Charlie, concluded. Their species is known as 'Domonoids', hailing from the planet 'Otto'. Once slaves to a tyrannical ruler for centuries. Their old species name and planet name were erased from all records. Choosing their own path forward. They changed themselves to be calculative, cunning, passionate, and most importantly, loyal to the Federation.

""Is that wise? The border we gave them will be under constant surveillance now. For all we know, both the Republic and Confederacy are eying up 'our' territory."" Benjin suggests, challenging the Domonoid. They all watched as Charlie's blue eye sensor bounced side to side in calculation. *They still think like a machine after all these years*.

""I say we sent a force of ten ships with an Ambassador to Raxus as protection. Flex our muscles at both the Republic and Confederacy. We've all read Jame's reports about how those slimy senator bastards think of us.""

Sina Vang, Secretary of Defense, declared. Benjin had half a mind to agree. But he knew her mother's side was coming through. She stood, showing the options of ships on the Holodisplay. At seven feet tall, she was small for her mother species. Part Cyclops, descended from the original three thousand homeguard of Cyclopea, and part human, the head mechanic of the Mars shipdocks. *Part grease monkey, and part mythical warrior.*

He watched as her muscles bulged in pride of the new Orion class Battleships coming out of Mars ship docks in a week's time on the HoloDisplay.

""Now hold on,"" General Joseph Stinger interjected, ""Sending just one of those could be seen as an act of aggression. From our reports on the CIS naval capabilities. A Jupiter-class destroyer would be more than enough. The Orion Class should be used to replace the defence fleets' Rahman Battleships.""

This round table discussion went on for what felt like hours before Benjin noticed one had remained silent. A veteran of the fourth galactic expansion. Ayda Leodi, an old *Earth* coin dancing between her thin fingers. Her green eyes were watching its every move.

Her pale skin contrasted against her Indicolite uniform of her people, Ernan. When her long blonde hair was down, you could mistake her for Terranian. But once up, as it was now, there was no denying her species' distinct feature. Long, pointed, six-inch ears decorated with emerald rings.

""Director Leodi,"" Benjin cuts through the discussion, ""any input from F.I.A? What do you suggest?""

She stopped the coin on her ring finger; all eyes watched as she rested it on the table. She coughed before speaking. ""Simple, Sir. Keep our heads down and go along with the facade of a small 'backwater' government. Let's send an Ambassador at the Count's request."" Her voice was like fresh silk.

""So, just see where the negotiations go?""

""Essentially. And deploy cloaked beacons in the surrounding space. The CIS was smart in encrypting their transmissions on a different code base from The Republic. I'd say kilometers better than theirs.""

""So we keep sitting on our asses like we've been doing for over three millennia?"" Sina was back at her chair, using it to support her muscular figure. Her knuckles clenched the top, painted nails ready to dig into the fabric. ""Even if what the Count says isn't true, and is covering for one of his own in their government, it's basically an act of war. We have to do something.""

Ayda looked at her, emotionless, eyes on one. The massive eye lid blinking quickly, like a nervous tic. ""I agree, Sina. But we can't go guns blazing as the three-thousand home guard would.""

""And why's that, huh?""

""Because intelligence is the name of the game, then logistics, and lastly, manpower. It is the most important, because its power needs to be used to direct the other two."" She then looked to Benjin, ""Mister President. You know as well as I do that we are going to be dragged into this conflict sooner or later. I say this to all of you as well.""

He thought about the statement and its implications as she continued.

""So what I recommend again is this. Buy as much time as we can, collect critical information, and make as many allies with systems from both the Republic and Confederacy as we can. Preferably, the Outer Rim.""

He raised an eyebrow to this, along with everyone else at the table. Then he understood, ""Hmm, I can see where you're going. If it comes down to it, we divide and conquer. Surround them, then emerge as the victor.""

""Exactly.""

""Charlie, what is the probability of either the Republic or the Confederacy attacking us first?""

Attention went to the Domonoid, who then projected various statistics. ""Mister President, the numbers are showing here that the odds right now of either are lower than before the 'First Contact'. With the Galactic Republic at forty-eight percent, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems at fifty-two percent.""

""All of these will very likely change if and when the Galactic Community finds out what happened over three millennia. It's how you Humans say, 'It's a crapshoot'.""

""Noted. Admiral Lang, we need a ship. Any ideas? Nothing too flashy, eh?"" Benjin questioned the old man to his right. He remained quiet as he sipped his coffee.

Admiral Władysław Lang, the Secretary of the Navy, is a man with a reputation for battle. You could mistake him for a grandfather. But at two-hundred and twenty-five, he's still in his prime. The gray mustache makes him resemble those from early twentieth-century photographs of generals.

His gruff, German-Polish accent came clear from the artificial tongue. ""I have one in mind, Sir. But I must ask, could it be multiple ships? Or just one.""

""One or two should suffice.""

""Very good, Sir. Then I suggest the FTS Empress Josephine and Queen Mary, respectively. Both being frigates should be a good show of force. Though with the Confederacy Munificent-class star frigates being about two-hundred meters shorter, this should show how different we designate ships.""

He stopped for questions, but was met with silence. Allowing one to compose herself, once seated, Sina started. ""The Empress Josephine, and Queen Mary? Are you suggesting the Venus-class frigates?""

""Yes.""

""Those two are over a thousand years old, and the last of their class. As well as being an experimental class of ships, they are set to transition into museums by year's end. Why in Antoria's Six Moons would we send those two?""

The Admiral finished his coffee before speaking. He placed it on the table, allowing an automated system to replenish to his preference. ""Simple."" He gestured a command from his NIC to the HoloDisplay. Rippling a screen for all to see, the two ships in question showed. Along with a Munificent-class star frigate. Each spinning slowly to show its every detail.

""The Venus-class has about the same firepower as the Munificent. If not more, depending on the variant. Since the last two of the Venus-class are Empress and Queens, they are comparable to the old Harrower-class dreadnought of the long-gone 'New' Sith Empire, but of course with modern equipment. Not in design, of course.""

The Quark-Scale hypercomputer battle simulation data appeared. In terms of using the similar kind of hardware, it should be even with minor differences. Benjin and his cabinet took in the flow of data.

Differences transpired when taking into account the Terran factor. Citizens of the Federation operating such crafts put the odds far above those of robots operating the Munificents. A game of catch-up in skill trickles high and high with each encounter.

""They will do, and who are their Captains?"" Benjin questioned. Sina brought the file up. Faces, rank, achievements, birthplace, age, gender, reflexes, and morale of the crew all listed.

""Of the Empress Josephine is Captain Hugo Monet. Born in Napoleon, Mars. Ninety-eight years of age and has been the Empress Josephine's captain for fifty-one. Service records show multiple achievements, including during the Silent Night campaigns and the War of the Five Empresses. The Monets have basically captained that Frigate since she left the dry-dock, Sir.""

""I've heard about the Monets. Legends in the academy, and what about the Queen Mary?"" He questioned, allowing her to change displays. This one, however, he had known more of, practically an extension of his own family.

""Captain Emilia Niles of the Queen Mary. Born in Atlantis, Terra. Forty-five years old and has been her captain for five years. The Niles are basically a political family. All but her have held some form of government office in the Federation. And wanted to-""

Benjin cut him off, ""I know what she wanted. She had me sign her up for the damn academy behind her parents' back,"" he said, staring at the display, sighing. *James isn't gonna like this.*

I started about a month ago and it feels like they are testing my patience to see if I can stick it out in the long-term  which is ironic since in theory it's supposed to be the easiest job (food court cashier).

HOWEVER, it's been extremely slow lately and I hate to sit and look pretty.

Two of the managers, seem to want to test my patience with how much I can put up. They seemingly micromanage everything I do or don't do. If I leave a rag on the counter checking out guests. If there is water dripping from coffee pots. If I leave boxes of chips out where the guest can see them. If I get caught up in conversation with friends when there is ZERO business.

Sure I may not be the exemplary employee and I have my faults but it seems they are sucking the life out of me. I went on my day off to eat and I felt real uneasy.

I'm a single dude moving to Sac for work around downtown. I want to be close to the ""action"" while balancing quiet at night since I'm in my early 30s and in the middle of discovering how many bones have started loudly clicking from inside my body when I stretch in the morning. Land/Curtis Park(s) look cool and cozy, but I want a busier trade-off between city access and reduced noise/property nuisance compared to living in Midtown proper, which East Sac seems to offer with its overall amenity profile (coffee/parks/grocery/bars/etc), so I am biased toward that area for now.

Initially, I thought I should live in Midtown and develop my frame for Sacramento's identity from there. I was super stoked about that idea until I learned about the parking situation and how complex that might be to handle, not only for residents, but more importantly (to me) for guests. I'm coming from out of town, but not so far that family and friends wouldn't likely come chill for a day/night/weekend. I’d grab a place with covered/assigned parking for a guest or myself to use in heartbeat of course, but to my current impression, there’s no preventing company from circling blocks to grab a (hopefully) nearby spot just to come hang out if they happen to bring a car, most notably in Midtown. I looked into RPP details but I'm interested in hearing about the average Midtown/East Sac resident's experience about how easy or complicated it's been to accomodate company/guests according to parking zone regulations. For Midtown, I'm considering Newton Booth, Poverty Ridge, and New era Park, and for East Sac I'm looking at pretty much anything that's got public listings including 40s, 30s, River Park, and so on, prioritizing whatever is furthest from the highways. I'm aware of the ArcGIS parking zone map and that regulations don't apply to every zone in East Sac, but oh my God it spatters the Midtown’s map like a Picasso painting.

To clarify, I’m equally stoked for either area assuming it wouldn’t be a pain for vehicle-having friends/family to find their way over without 1) having a prohibitive/excessively bad time finding parking, and 2) worrying about the safety of their car generally. Would love to hear others’ experiences.

1qn9blf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1qn9blf/my_complete_experience_with_hpylori_positive/,My complete experience with Hpylori (positive outcomeh,"Hey everyone ! I promised myself I would share my entire experience with Hpylori, as reading about it about others helped me a lot go through all the process. 

It all started a couple of months ago, I was bringing my kid to school as a 35 year old father, when I had the sensation I wanted to throw up. Kind of like when you drink too much alcohol and you fight off the urge to throw up. It was sudden and weird, and happened for the first time. I was obviously sober, so no idea how that happened. 

Since that day, I had a weird bloat on the upper part of the stomach. Felt like if I threw up it would get rid of whatever was bothering. No pain, no nothing, just some on or off bloating, maybe a slight tickle, some hiccups. But nothing else. 

I went to the dr for the first time, blood panel was fine, STDs, all the usual checks and everything was all right. The dr said it might be my stomach getting older and just vibing, but if it maintained like that for a week, I should call back. He put me on a Bland Diet to see if there were any trigger foods. I was serious about it and couldn’t find any trigger foods  

It maintained very similarly. I started reading on different causes, and I had another episode of wanting to throw up during a morning run, so 5 days later, I go to the doc again. Same diagnosis, this time he recommends my a gas relief like Gasx. Didn’t do anything. 

5 days later I go back to the doc and start telling him about all the literature I found online. Cancer, Hpylori, etc etc. I WANTED to do checks. He complied and told we we d do a Hpylori breath test, but he was sure it couldn’t be that as I showed very few symptoms. He was also very adamant it couldn’t be cancer. If it were though Hpylori though, he was quite positive about how treatable it would be and that it would be a good outcome as it would most likely be the cause of my issues. 

If the test was negative though, he would refer me to a specialist ans we’d go the endoscopy route etc. 

IT WAS POSITIVE. I had Hpylori

My initial reaction was relief, because at least I knew what was up. Also I wasn’t scared of taking a treatment or whatever. Oh boy was I unprepared lol. 

I started the day after. I had Omeprazole, Met, Bismuth and the 4th I cant remember, but classic quadtherapy. My pharmacist wasn’t really clear on the instructions and I ended up with a weird planning. All I was told by my pharmacist was to delay some of the medications and to not drink alcohol. Which I didn’t. 

I would wake up at 6am, and every 6 hours to the dot, I would take all the medicines together, except the Omeprazole which was twice a day instead of 4. I would eat 2 hours after, and would stay kinda food deprived before taking medecines again. Mostly broccoli and cauliflower, raw in the beginning but by the end of the treatment I would not give a F. anymore and would eat anything that s not too heavy or unhealthy. ( no spicy and no fries foods or sugary stuff )

The medication was BRUTAL. I had to work and jesus, all the side effects I got. Some days getting up was aweful. Waking at 6 to down some pills that make you feel sicker and sicker, it was a once in a lifetime experience, at least for now. I was really drained and weak, could barely work and definitely couldn t work out. I missed coffee so much and my stomach and guts were in shambles. It got worse fast, then better, then the last 3 days were aweful. 

The WORST was the fkin aweful taste of the Met medicine, that thing is foul, it’s absolutely brutal. Just thinking about it makes me wanna throw up. I had to drink it with boiling hot tea to make it work. It ruined tea for me. I didn’t dare brush my teeth or take gum in the first days because you have to be empty stomach, but by day 6 / 14, I couldn’t care anymore and added sugar free gum and brushed my teeth right after each Met. 

I panicked on day 8/14 because I realized that one of the medecines had to be taken separately with the Bismuth or else it cancels out. I freaked out so much that I went through all of this for nothing. I felt so stupid for not having asked any more questions. But yeah, I saw that people on Reddit were being really curious about the timing of the pills and a lot of people were self informed. Anyways I panicked but my doc told me to keep the same routine and I was doing well. So I decided to keep going. 

Day 14 was the coolest day ever. Honestly, I felt better right away. Probably from not having to swallow 20 pills a day and not having to taste that Met pill. I got coffee right away, but still waited 3 - 4 days to get alcohol. 

It was all like nothing happened. Back to normal. It ended 10 days before Christmas, I ate all kinds of foods, drank wine every day, worked out every day during the 3 week holiday period. Living my best life. 

I had 2 - 3 days I had massive bloating, much more than usual, but without the throw up sensation, some time after, like a month after, but I read it was kind of normal as the gut and stomach is pretty much destroyed from the treatment. It takes months to be back to normal, but honestly, appart from those days, I feel at 100%. 

I got tested once again a month and a half ago, no more Pylori !

Lemme know if you have any questions but yeah, stick the course and it ll be aight !",2,1769411950.0,HPylori,2,1.0,False

It’s as if my birth control was helping and my body is becoming used to it and returning to the pain I had before I began bc.

I’ve been dealing with this pain for years, and only got relief a couple months into starting birth control. Yet I’ve somehow never looked into diets/exercise and what I’m consuming. I want to look at this from a different perspective to see if I can find relief somewhere.

This is Day 42 of Baronry.. There seem to have been a shift last night. The Sgt Major sent all counselors a request for an emergency meeting very early this morning.

I had a coffee and when I went out of my house I found a guard watching my house which said ""Good Morning Sir then followed me to City Hall.

I saw every other counsellors being escorted to City Hall. I noticed 4 Ykanti in civilian clothing but could see them keeping an eye on Elisabeths house. 

""Not to be put in official logs.""

The Sgt Major started the debrief with apologies.

'Sorry for calling you all in at a time which is early for you. As you will notice Elisabeth is not here and what we talk about at this meeting will not reach her hears for now.

Late last night I received a call from the General asking for me to put a discreet armed guard on his daughter. 

We are not to panick her with worries of her fathers health and this is just prevenvitive.

As you all kmow he is doing the first toy drop today. He will be making a Huge announcement about the Orphanage. 

What very few know is that right after the announcement he is going to respond to one of his Colonels meetings in person.

This Colonel was a Radical so as precaution he wants us to put extra security on his daughter.

I have increased all your security because if this Colonel is radical all Nobles and his daughter might need it.

If the meeting is peacefull great we can stand down tomorrow but for today expect more patrols.

I have doubled patrols. I have placed some of my Ykanti soldiers at the Inn casually watching Elisabeths house. They are armed with consealed laser weapons. Some Ykanti soldiers will be working in her garden are also armed.

I have doubled the guards on the acesses into town.

We are to keep this from Elisabeth until further notice.

As you know we got a big screen to watch the General interview later tonight.

Any Question.?

I asked "" can we make our escorts least visible? If I have overnight guards they can sit in my house and watch some of my movies.""

All those being escorted agreed to have guards indoors. The General agreed to indoors but no to movies as they have to be alert.

The meeting ended and we went for breakfast. The Sgt Major instead of breakfast went to give directions to his troops.

Aino Log Night.

We all gathered for the evening news. The hall on the second floor was full and we watch the news on a big screen.

People cheered when the General announced the changes to Orphanages. Many tears were seen when the little girl spoke to General with her Teddy Bear.

Elisabeth said she was being followed by Ykanti all day. I blushed as I lied to her saying ""Maybe they are measuring you for a statue?""

The hall emptied and everybody went home.

The board of directors were asked to stay behind for the late broadcast.

We listened to more news then the screen changed.

""Special Report""

The news reporters came on now in studio 

""Ab attemp on the Generals life was foiled today by the General troops.""

When Elisabeth was to stand up in shock the General gently put his hand on her shoulder saying ""he's fine. No worries.""


""We were asked to send a TV crew to the base. This is what we recorded when the Firentis landed.

On scene is our local reporter. Jim Bucktail reporting from the scene.""

""Kim what you see??""

Jim ""the shuttle just landed. The military are escorting a Colonel off the shuttle and uncovering his head. He is gagged.""

""General can you tell us what happened?""

General ""After the orphanage today I went to a meeting which the Colonel asked me to come to. This ended up being an attempt on my life. My troops foiled their plans.""

Jim ""General is everybody alright?"" 

General ""Thanks to my aid I am fine but he is recovering in the hospital as he took 3 bullets for me. He will be fine and recovering in the ICU thanks to Mister Aaa which volunteered to provide healthcare to Haego. 

All the ambush team were eliminated except for the Colonel.""

Jim ""General should we worry about his other troops on his base.""

General ""My troops entered their base and dissarmed all of them until interigations into his murders and all interviewed. Seems like the Colonel killed many innocent which will not be tolerates.""

""We are looking for witnesses into the Colonel crimes. If his troops or others that witness these crimes are offered reduced sentences for those not giving orders and simply following them are offered fair treatment.""

Jim ""What next General?""

General ""We will hold a very open and honest investigation. We will hold a trial. If found guilty punishments will be handed. Now we need to process the Colonel. Stay tuned.""

General walks away 

Jim ""This is Jim Bucktail reporting from Haego for the Firentis Grand Informer.""

Went back to the Studio and they closed off the Special Report .

Aino apologized stating het father did not want her to worry.

The Sgt Major informed Elisabeth of the Ykanti Bodyguards and insisted they would remain in place until further notice. 

When she found out of others huards offered a space indoors she also extended it to her security team.

As the nation mourned the killing of VA ICU nurse Alex Pretti yesterday at the hands of federal officials in Minneapolis, President Donald J. Trump spent last night at the White House at a black-tie private screening of a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump. Amazon paid $40 million for the rights to the film just weeks after executive chair Jeff Bezos dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the former president’s reelection and is spending another $35 million to promote the film. 

Then, this morning, Trump’s social media account posted a 450-word social media screed complaining about the lawsuit against his addition of a massive ballroom to the White House. Calling the National Trust for Historic Preservation a “Radical Left” organization, the account claimed that the addition “is being done with the design, consent, and approval of the highest levels of the United  States Military and Secret Service. The mere bringing of this ridiculous lawsuit has already, unfortunately, exposed this heretofore Top Secret fact. Stoppage of construction, at this late date, when so much has already been ordered and done, would be devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.” 

This morning, administration officials doubled down on their insistence that the killing had been justified.

On CNN’s State of the Union this morning, U.S. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino claimed the true victims of yesterday’s shooting were federal agents. He confirmed that the agents who killed Pretti yesterday remain on the streets today, though they have been reassigned elsewhere. FBI director Kash Patel claimed on the Fox News Channel that the fact Pretti was carrying a weapon proved that he was planning trouble, although because he was part of a community-led first-responder network, carrying the weapon for which he had a permit made sense. 

But Americans are not buying it. They are coalescing around the idea of the American people versus an out-of-control government. As conservative lawyer George Conway put it: “I just checked—it turns out that Art. II, Sec. 1 of the Constitution of the United States does *not* say 'The executive Power shall be vested in a bunch of sociopaths who think they can do whatever the f*ck they want and make sh*t up as they go along.'""

Reports out of Minnesota say that in the face of the terror inflicted on it by federal agents, the people there are even more closely linked together in community solidarity. They are patrolling the streets, donating food, delivering groceries, helping with legal services, organizing to look out for each other in a demonstration of community solidarity so foreign to administration figures that Attorney General Pam Bondi yesterday suggested that there was something nefarious about how well organized they are as they protect their neighbors.

In Minneapolis today, the Minnesota prison system took the extraordinary step of launching its own website to combat lies from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Its first major announcement suggested that Bovino had lied about the Border Patrol operation that was underway when agents killed Alex Pretti. The Minnesota Department of Corrections expressed its condolences to the family and loved ones of Alex Pretti and said that although Bovino claimed that the operation was targeting a man with a significant criminal history, that information was false. 

In fact, the individual Bovino identified had never been in custody in Minnesota, and records showed only traffic-related offenses for him. Records did show, though, that he had been in federal immigration custody during Trump’s first administration and had been released.

Chief Brian O’Hara of the Minneapolis Police Department told Margaret Brennan of Face the Nation, “People have had enough. This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone, and now this is the second American citizen that’s been killed, it’s the third shooting within three weeks…. This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll, trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It’s too much."" 

The Minnesota National Guard made it clear which side they were on. Wearing neon vests to distinguish themselves from federal agents, they handed out doughnuts, coffee, and hot chocolate to anti-ICE protesters. 

The National Basketball Players Association said it could no longer remain silent. “Now more than ever,” it said, “we must defend the right to freedom of speech and stand in solidarity with the people in Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice. The fraternity of NBA players, like the United States itself, is a community enriched by its global citizens, and we refuse to let the flames of division threaten the civil liberties that are meant to protect us all. The NBPA and its members extend our deepest condolences to the families of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, just as our thoughts remain focused on the safety and well-being of all members of our community.” 

The newest killing has opened up a rift in Republican ranks. Administration officials not allied with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and her cronies are complaining to reporters, including Bill Melugin of the Fox News Channel, that they are frustrated with DHS officials’ statements that Pretti was intending a “massacre” of federal agents in the face of videos that disprove such absurd claims. They have told Melugin such comments are “catastrophic.” “[W]e are losing this war,” sources say, “we are losing the base and the narrative.” 

Indeed, at the base level of politics, MAGA supporters who support gun ownership are appalled by statements like that of FBI director Kash Patel, who told the Fox News Channel’s Maria Bartiromo, “You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. It's that simple. You don't have the right to break the law and incite violence.” But Pretti had a license to carry a weapon, and he did not brandish it. President Rob Doar of the Minnesota Gun Owners Law Center noted that Pretti had the right to carry a gun in that situation and that it shouldn’t be necessary “to choose between exercising your First Amendment rights or your Second Amendment rights.” He expressed concern that “our government and agents of our government are not engaging in good faith with what we’re seeing with our own eyes.”

Lawyer John Mitnick, who served as deputy counsel of the Homeland Security Council from its inception during the George W. Bush administration and then served as general counsel of the United States Department of Homeland Security from 2018 to 2019, when he clashed with Stephen Miller, wrote on social media: “I helped to establish DHS in 2002 and 2003 and later had the homeland security portfolio as a White House Counsel and served as General Counsel of the Department. I am enraged and embarrassed by DHS’s lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty. Impeach and remove Trump—now.” 

Aside from a few strong MAGA voices, elected Republicans appeared reluctant to defend the killing. Neither Senate majority leader John Thune (R-SD) nor House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) commented on it. 

Vermont’s Republican governor Phil Scott did, though, leading the way for other Republicans in districts that are sliding away from MAGA. In a statement, he said: “Enough…It’s not acceptable for American citizens to be killed by federal agents for exercising their God-given and constitutional rights to protest their government. At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training, and leadership. At worst, it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans…. The president should pause these operations, de-escalate the situation, and reset the federal government’s focus on truly criminal illegal immigrants. In the absence of presidential action, Congress and the courts must step up to restore constitutionality.” 

G. Elliot Morris of Strength in Numbers noted today that even the Republican-leaning Rasmussen polls have shown that 59% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, while only 39% approve. In Strength in Numbers today, he reported that “Trump’s 2024 coalition has come undone.” He explained that “[y]oung voters, non-white voters, and low-turnout voters who swung to Trump from 2020 to 2024 have swung back against him in force. In many cases, these groups are even more anti-Trump now than they were ahead of the 2020 election.”

Morris also noted that Trump’s approval rating is not underwater in ten of the states he won in 2024, as I wrote last night. It’s underwater in fifteen. 

Today the editorial boards of both Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal and his New York Post urged the administration to pause its ICE operations in Minneapolis after the killing of Alex Pretti. The Wall Street Journal’s famously right-wing editorial board warned that “[t]he Trump Administration spin on this simply isn’t believable.” It continued: “Ms. Noem and Mr. Miller aren’t credible spokesmen. Their social-media and cable-TV strategy is to own the libs, rather than to persuade Americans. This is backfiring against Republicans…. Mr. Miller’s mass deportation methods are turning immigration, an issue Mr. Trump owned in 2024, into a political liability for Republicans in 2026. Americans don’t want law enforcement shooting people in the street or arresting five-year-old boys.”

Tonight, the editorial board of the New York Post warned that Trump’s ICE actions in Minneapolis are “backfiring.” “Swing voters…see US citizens dying at federal agents’ hands, and recoil in horror.” It concluded: “Mr. President, the American people didn’t vote for these scenes and you can’t continue to order them to not believe their lying eyes.”

Trump’s social media account turned defensive tonight. After repeating Trump’s false claim that he had won election in a historic landslide (in reality, he won less than 50% of the vote), it blamed Democrats for the chaos ICE and CBP agents have caused in Democratic-led cities. It demanded that every Democratic mayor and governor cooperate with the administration to “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

Yesterday, after Alex Pretti’s death, the son of a man Pretti had cared for at the VA hospital published a video of Pretti speaking at his father’s deathbed. “Today we remember that freedom is not free,” Pretti said. “We have to work at it, nurture it, protect it, and even sacrifice for it. May we never forget and always remember our brothers and sisters who have served so that we may enjoy the gift of freedom. So in this moment, we remember and give thanks for their dedication and selfless service to our nation in the cause of our freedom. In this solemn hour, we [give] them our honor, and our gratitude.”

1qn93ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/bihar/comments/1qn93ux/we_should_set_an_example_of_being_good_tourists/,We should set an example of being good tourists to improve our image,"There were a few incidents of bad tourists in Sikkim in recent days from our state, now definitely few negative experiences do not define the whole community but people do cherry pick and generalize. 

Now a lot of you will say that I'm sensible, I don't throw trash or talk rowdly or something like that in tourist places, but what everyone reading this can do is being positive rather than just being neutral, by neutral I mean just following the rules, driving, talking, eating as you should, whereas by being positive and extra generous I mean a few points that one can do, I've myself been doing this and they do make a difference, and make people wonder as if their conception of Biharis was wrong:

• Saying 'Please and Sorry' will not decrease your value, a lot of times I feel people might take on their ego if they have to say please or sorry even if they by mistake did something awkward, say if you have to just ask for a straw for coffee, one way to ask is simply saying, another is putting on a smile and saying ""can I get a straw please"", it does make a difference. 

• Language awareness, at times we let our town slangs slip into our language as common phrases, it might be cringe for others to hear that, so keep language normal and don't talk in slang type, one of my friends once said to some outsider ""Re late ho rahis hai hamlog ko"", now my friend is very sweet and didn't mean anything wrong but some outsider might find it offensive if they are being addressed as ""Abe sun"" Or ""Sun na Reh"", even though it might be normal for you. 

•Say ""Hi, Hello, GM"" when you come across a waiter, cashier, it goes a long way, saying bye with a smile while leaving always leaves a heartly impression. 

•Cleanliness is half the battle, don't litter, keep trash in bag or keep a polythene with you. Dress well. 

•Share about Bihar's positives and appreciate their culture, try to do small conversation, like if you are in Darjeeling, you may talk about Bodhgaya, in UP, can talk about Sitamarhi, as to how everyone is aware about Ayodhya but very less about Sitamarhi, talk about Nalanda, IAS, Rajgir. Just asking someone in Nepal's mountain as to how life is there different from living in urban areas or as to what's unique in living such a terrain might leave a lasting impression for years, you have 2 ears and 1 mouth, use them in that ratio.

I posted about my first ever App I built few days ago and to my surprise, Reddit gave me all love and flowers instead of ripping it apart.

  
In just 48 hours, SkyLocation has been downloaded over **1500 times** and even broke into the **Top 100 App Charts at #86!**

**Almost everyone is buying Pro immediately for lifetime as its so affordable, Less than a cup of coffee.**

Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours on flights staring out the window wondering, ""What city is that?"" or ""Where actually are we?""

So, I decided to build SkyLocation, my very first app. I used Xcode and ChatGPT for the execution of my idea. Being non technical, I still cannot believe my idea became a reality and its been loved by hundreds.

The goal was simple: Pure, offline clarity. I built the entire app in XCode.

The response has been absolutely surreal.

Here is what it does (and why I’m proud of it):

1. Offline Reverse Geocoding: I built in an offline database so it can tell you the nearest city and country without needing a ping to a server.
2. Emergency SOS: This was a big one for me. If you’re hiking or off-grid and lose signal, you can capture your exact location and share it with emergency contacts instantly.
3. Privacy First: **No accounts, no tracking, no data collection, no subscriptions**. It’s just a utility that lives on your phone.

Please do download and give me your feedback:

1qn90d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1qn90d2/just_a_thought/,Just a thought,"I started my Invisalign 2 months ago. I think what I noticed so far that many people who are here share lots of confusing things based on their personal experience. What shocked me the most is 1) how many people say to drink whatever (beers, wine (!?) and soda) with Invisalign on? 🤯 I mean sure it didn’t make any damage for you (yet) but my Invisalign provider said that you have to always take it off. Maybe if it doesn’t have sugar it will only stain like coffee, herbal tea or Yerba mate 🧉 and then you have to rinse anyway with water. But other than that I’m kind of surprised. Or 2) people who don’t wash teeth after eating and they put alligners back in and they wait few hours. 

Please at least inform others that it’s your personal case and not general recomended thing. We invest lots of money into it and nobody wants to have cavities after treatment or more damage later.

1qn8whr,https://www.reddit.com/r/thrillerbooks/comments/1qn8whr/the_ex_freida_mcfadden/,The Ex- Freida McFadden,"2.5 stars out of 5 from me. 

The book was okay. Easy to follow along the story was decent. I did figure out one of the twists pretty soon in, when Lydia met ‘the ex’ in the store and was acting weird about catching up with a coffee but was upping Francesca to Cassie my first thought was “Francesca is NOT ‘The Ex’ 

Here’s some things I liked.

I liked how you could never of guessed it was Anna. 

I liked how the scenes of Cassie getting harassed played out from her point of view. 

I liked the fact Joel was weird when Francesca was brought up it added a bit of “does he love her or does he hate her”

Here’s some things I can’t make sense of or didn’t like: 

Why did Lydia act weird with Anna in the store when Anna mentioned getting a coffee and catching up yet when Cassie and Joel met Lydia, Anna, Con and Pete at the zoo Cassie describes Anna and Lydia as friendly and even thinks they’re gossiping about her?

Why wouldn’t Joel just tell Cassie that Francesca was dead. I know it would kind of ruin the plot but it’s just super unrealistic. 

What was up with Maureen. It built up like something would happen with her. 

Joel and Anna becoming friends makes no sense to me. It’s super weird and unrealistic. 

Cassies secret and why she didn’t want the police snooping about was lowkey very disappointing. It would have made sense for Cassie to be the one in major debt owing bad people money. I’d assume a used bookstore with no customers would be in greater need of money than an Italian restaurant. 

After finding out Anna was the ex all the previous chapters that mentioned her just kind of felt strange and made little to no sense. ",1,1769410554.0,thrillerbooks,1,1.0,False

Etsy SEO isn’t witchcraft.
It’s not an “AI hack” either.
It’s just business. Old-school. Dirty hands. Real work.

I see it every week: people upload a vintage leather bag like it’s a lost sock.

Title: “Vintage bag”
Tags: “leather”, “cool”, “retro”
Photos: half-dark, half-cat in the background
And then they act surprised nobody finds it.

Etsy is not a romantic flea market with fairy lights.
Etsy is a search engine with a poker face.

You don’t win by shouting. You win by being precise.
Not making your item sound prettier than it is, but making sure it shows up in the right place, for the right buyer, at the right moment.

And yeah, that sounds boring.
Until you sell a bag while you’re literally making coffee.
Then it suddenly feels like magic.
Only the name is “structure.”

Etsy Runs on Exact Match (Not Vibes)

Etsy thinks in exact match.

That means your words have to be correct.
Not “close enough.” Not “same energy.”
Exact. Like a measuring tape.

The scary algorithm stuff is actually simple:

Etsy likes listings that get clicks

Favorites

Sales

Good shop experience

And when something is freshly listed, Etsy gives it a short boost
Like a little shoulder tap: “Alright, show me what you’ve got.”


Then comes the real game: quality.

Not “quality” as in you say it’s quality.
Quality as in: people view, stay, click, buy.

That’s the currency.


---

Declumping: Etsy Won’t Put Your Whole Shop on One Page

Here’s the fun one: declumping.

Etsy doesn’t want your entire shop flooding one search page.
Usually you get one or two placements per results page.

So if you upload 20 bags all titled “Vintage leather bag”, you’re not optimizing.
You’re blocking yourself.

It’s like locking your own shop door and complaining nobody walks in.


---

“Vintage” Is a Cheat Code (If You Use It Right)

Vintage isn’t about screaming “VINTAGE” 34 times like a market seller selling garlic.
It’s about filling your attributes properly.

Mark it as vintage.
Select the decade.
Set the material correctly.

Buyers filter. Etsy loves filters.
Filters are Etsy’s love language.

So no, you don’t need “vintage” 34 times in your title.
You need to say what it is.

Not: “vintage bag”
But: “1970s brown leather satchel”

That’s not poetry. That’s GPS.


---

Keywords: Etsy Literally Hands You the Answers

This is where 90% of people mess up.

Everyone wants “the best keywords,” like there’s a golden list locked in Silicon Valley.

Meanwhile Etsy gives you the real answers for free.

Type “leather bag” in Etsy search.
Look at the dropdown suggestions.

That’s what people are typing right now.
Not theory. Not “SEO tips.”
Actual behavior. Actual money.

Street wisdom, digital edition:
listen to what customers say, not what you hope they say.

If you want to nerd out: eRank and Marmalead are fine.
But remember: tools don’t do the work.
They help you see. You still have to cut the leather.


---

The 3-Level Keyword System (Trade, Not Fluff)

This is how I build a listing, every time.

1) Class keyword

The broad category your item lives in.
Vintage handbags. Vintage purses.
That’s your street.

2) Kind keyword

The type of bag it actually is.
Crossbody. Shoulder bag. Satchel. Doctor’s bag.
That’s the shop window.

3) Exact match keyword

The money phrase:
Era + material + color + type + vibe
1970s brown leather satchel
1980s black leather crossbody

Your first words in the title matter.
Because Etsy reads them like border control.

So lead with the strongest description.
Not your brand story.
Not your feelings.
The sharp words first.

Example title (how it should look):

1970s Brown Leather Satchel | Vintage Shoulder Bag | Retro Leather Purse | Boho EU

Yes, it’s search-engine language.
That’s the point.

You’re not writing for your ego.
You’re writing to be found.


---

Tags Aren’t Decoration. Tags Are a Contract.

Those 13 tags should match your title.
Don’t wander off into creative nonsense. Etsy wants overlap.

If your title is: 1970s brown leather satchel
Your tags should look like:

1970s leather satchel

brown leather bag

vintage shoulder bag

retro leather purse

boho satchel

70s handbag

european leather bag


Not:

cute bag

gift idea

festival vibes


That’s emotional clutter. Great for Pinterest. Useless for Etsy search.


---

Your Description: Human Without Sabotaging Search

This is where you stay human without breaking SEO.

No need for a novel.
But do cover:

what it is

condition

measurements

how the leather feels

closure type

inside compartments

the vibe: city / workwear / travel / everyday


I sell leather constantly. Belts, bags, all of it.
And here’s the truth:

People don’t just buy a bag.
They buy certainty.

They want to know:

does this fit my life?

can I trust this seller?

will this last?

or will it fall apart in two weeks at a random train station?


Vintage buyers are often done with disposable trash.
They like things with a life already lived.
They don’t fear a scratch.
They understand patina is proof.

That’s the psychology you want to hit.


---

Photos Will Kill Your Listing Faster Than Bad SEO

You can have perfect keywords and still lose if your photos suck.

Photos are your body language.
If your listing looks chaotic, buyers feel: risk.

Use clean light.
Use calm backgrounds.
Show close-ups: leather grain, stitching, edges, lining, hardware.
And add a measuring tape. Always.

Measurements aren’t optional.
They’re trust.

A bag without dimensions is like a car without mileage.
People instantly think: what are you hiding?


---

The Workflow (How I Actually Do It)

This is the routine. The boring stuff that prints money:

1. Find one strong exact match phrase


2. Pick 2–3 kind keywords


3. Choose 1 class keyword


4. Build your title from that


5. Pull tags from the same words


6. Fill attributes properly


7. Write the description like you’re talking to a sane buyer


8. Upload strong photos


9. Wait 30 days


10. Check Etsy Stats


11. Only then tweak



Don’t edit your listing every day out of panic.
That’s not optimization. That’s self-sabotage.


---

JVL Mode: Harderwijk. No Fairy Tales.

I don’t sell fantasies. I sell leather that’s seen things.

I’ve had bags that smelled like attic dust, old aftershave, train rides.
Bags that creak when you open them.

And still: they’ll outlive half the new “leather look” garbage from fast fashion.

That’s European leather culture.
Not luxury marketing.
Just craft, wear, patina, honest use.

Combine that with SEO that actually works, and the fun starts:

Because the right buyers find you.

Not people searching “bag.”
But buyers searching:

“1970s leather satchel”

“vintage crossbody for everyday”

“brown leather shoulder bag europe”


That’s long-tail.
That’s intent.
Those aren’t viewers. Those are payers.

No magic. Just skill.


---

Scaling Without Declumping Yourself

Don’t build 12 listings with the exact same main keyword.

Rotate your focus per item:

era (60s / 70s / 80s)

type (satchel / crossbody / tote / doctor bag)

color (brown / black / tan / cognac)

detail (brass buckle / flap / zip top / suede lining)

vibe (work bag / travel bag / minimal / boho / classic)


Now your shop hits more searches, without Etsy declumping you into silence.

That’s strategy.
Quiet. Old-school smart.


---

Yes, AI Can Help (But It Won’t Carry You)

AI is useful for:

generating keyword variations faster

keeping structure tight

content ideas: leather care, measuring guides, vintage education


But if you think one prompt makes you win, you’re exactly the customer Etsy profits from: dreamers.

Real profit comes from repeatable work.
Routine. Data. Adjust. Keep going.

Simple. Boring. Effective.

For an interior design enthusiast visiting a thoughtfully curated furniture showroom in Pune, this feeling is almost tangible. The year 2026 feels less about dramatic makeovers and more about intentional choices—pieces that support how people actually live, rest, work, and gather. Furniture, in this context, becomes far more than décor; it becomes the silent framework of daily life.

Walking past living room arrangements anchored by solid Sofas and [Indian sittings](https://soulwoodventures.com/indian-sitting/), it’s clear that homes today are being designed to slow things down. Seating is deeper, proportions are calmer, and materials feel reassuringly honest. There’s a growing awareness that what we sit on, sleep on, and work at directly shapes mood and comfort. A well-placed Center Table or a thoughtfully designed TV Unit subtly guides how a space is used, without demanding attention.

What stands out most is how furniture now carries emotional weight. A dining setup is no longer just about hosting guests—it’s about everyday meals, conversations, and rituals. A bedroom anchored by a sturdy Bed and generous Wardrobe reflects a desire for rest and order. In 2026, furniture choices signal priorities: longevity over impulse, craftsmanship over trends, and comfort over clutter. This mindset becomes the foundation for homes that feel grounded, personal, and quietly confident.

# Designing with Intention: Choosing Furniture That Reflects Your 2026 Lifestyle

As the walkthrough continues, a recurring theme becomes evident—intention. The furniture on display doesn’t feel assembled to impress, but rather to support real lifestyles. In 2026, homes are expected to do more than look good; they must adapt seamlessly to workdays, slow weekends, social gatherings, and solitary moments. The showroom layouts reflect this evolution beautifully.

Living areas are styled with Sofas paired thoughtfully with Chairs and Consoles, creating zones that encourage conversation rather than passive screen time. Indian Sittings appear not as nostalgic add-ons, but as grounding elements—perfect for reading corners or informal family gatherings. There’s an ease to how each piece seems to belong, as though it has been selected after careful observation of daily habits.

Dining spaces echo this same philosophy. [Dining sets](https://soulwoodventures.com/dining/) are neither oversized nor minimal to the point of discomfort. Dining Chairs, Bar Chairs, and Stools coexist in a way that mirrors modern Indian homes—where kitchens open into dining areas, and casual meals happen as often as formal ones. Furniture choices here feel responsive, not rigid.

Even transitional spaces are given importance. Writing [tables](https://soulwoodventures.com/tables/) are positioned as flexible surfaces—sometimes for work, sometimes for reflection. Nothing feels excessive. Everything feels purposeful. This intentional approach to furniture planning reflects a broader shift in how homes are designed in 2026: with clarity, adaptability, and a deep respect for how people truly live.

# Living Rooms in 2026: Sofas That Balance Comfort, Style, and Longevity

The living room displays draw attention immediately, not because they are loud, but because they feel composed. Sofas here are not treated as standalone pieces; they are part of a larger story involving space, movement, and comfort. As an interior design enthusiast observes these arrangements, it becomes clear that living rooms in 2026 are being designed for connection first.

Generously proportioned Sofas sit alongside accent Chairs and Indian Sittings, creating seating clusters rather than linear layouts. This subtle shift encourages conversation, reading, or simply sitting together without distraction. The materials—solid wood frames, textured upholstery—suggest durability without sacrificing warmth. These are pieces meant to age gracefully, not be replaced every few years.

[TV units](https://soulwoodventures.com/tv-units/) are integrated thoughtfully, never dominating the room. They function as visual anchors, often balanced by Consoles or shelving that holds books and Other Accessories rather than electronics alone. Center Tables complete the setting, chosen more for everyday use than visual drama. Their surfaces feel ready for coffee cups, books, and quiet moments.

What stands out is the absence of excess. Each living room setup feels edited, intentional, and calm. The furniture doesn’t compete for attention; instead, it works together to create an atmosphere. In 2026, living rooms seem less about showcasing design and more about supporting life—unhurried, comfortable, and quietly expressive.

# Center Tables & Consoles: Small Pieces That Anchor the Entire Space

Often underestimated, the smaller furniture pieces in the showroom quietly reveal their importance. [Center tables](https://soulwoodventures.com/center-table/) and Consoles, though modest in scale, appear to carry the emotional balance of a room. As the visitor moves from one setting to another, it becomes clear how these pieces shape everyday experiences without ever demanding attention.

Center Tables are positioned thoughtfully—never too large, never merely decorative. Their surfaces invite daily use, holding everything from books and trays to the occasional cup of tea. Crafted with solid wood and clean proportions, they ground the surrounding Sofas and Chairs, offering both visual and functional stability. In some settings, nested tables add flexibility, subtly reflecting the changing rhythms of modern living.

Consoles play an equally understated role. Placed behind seating or along entryways, they act as quiet transitions between spaces. A console beneath a mirror or artwork becomes a moment of pause—an invitation to slow down. These pieces often hold [other accessories](https://soulwoodventures.com/other-accesories/), lamps, or personal objects, reinforcing the idea that furniture should support storytelling, not overshadow it.

In 2026 homes, these smaller elements are no longer afterthoughts. They are deliberate choices that complete a space. Observing them in context highlights how thoughtful craftsmanship and proportion can elevate even the simplest furniture forms, making everyday living feel more composed and intentional.

# Dining Spaces for the New Year: Where Everyday Moments Become Rituals

The dining section of the showroom feels warm and inviting, almost familiar. Dining Sets are arranged not as formal displays, but as lived-in spaces—places where everyday meals naturally turn into shared moments. For the observer, it’s clear that dining furniture in 2026 is about balance: comfort, durability, and ease.

Dining Tables are paired with [dining chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/dining-chairs/) that prioritize posture without feeling stiff. Their designs are subtle, allowing materials and craftsmanship to speak quietly. In some layouts, Bar Chairs and [stools](https://soulwoodventures.com/stools/) appear at kitchen counters, reflecting how dining spaces have expanded beyond traditional boundaries. Meals now happen everywhere—from quick breakfasts to long conversations over dinner.

What’s striking is how these arrangements accommodate both routine and celebration. The furniture doesn’t feel reserved for special occasions; it feels ready for daily use. The finishes are forgiving, the proportions generous. These are pieces meant to witness life as it unfolds, not be preserved untouched.

The inclusion of nearby Modular Kitchens reinforces this idea. Dining areas flow naturally into cooking spaces, supported by furniture that feels cohesive rather than segmented. In 2026, dining furniture becomes a bridge—between people, routines, and spaces—quietly supporting connection without ever demanding attention.

# Bedroom Furniture for a Rest-First 2026

Moving into the bedroom displays, the mood shifts noticeably. The spaces feel calmer, softer, more introspective. Beds are the clear focal point, designed not for visual drama but for rest. Their solid frames and understated detailing suggest permanence—[furniture](https://soulwoodventures.com/products/) meant to support sleep and stillness over many years.

Wardrobes stand nearby, thoughtfully proportioned and designed to reduce visual clutter. Rather than dominating the room, they integrate seamlessly, offering storage that feels organized and unobtrusive. The emphasis here is not on capacity alone, but on clarity—spaces where everything has its place.

Side tables, [consoles](https://soulwoodventures.com/consoles/), and Other Accessories are used sparingly, reinforcing the idea that bedrooms in 2026 are sanctuaries. The presence of Writing Tables in some setups hints at quiet morning routines—journaling, reading, or gentle work before the day begins.

What resonates most is the sense of restraint. Nothing feels excessive. Every piece contributes to a restful atmosphere. The craftsmanship is evident in the details, but never overwhelming. Observing these bedroom settings leaves a lasting impression: that good furniture doesn’t just fill a room—it shapes how one rests, resets, and prepares for the day ahead.

# Storage That Simplifies Life: Wardrobes & Cabinets That Create Mental Space

As the walkthrough progresses, storage emerges as a quiet hero of the showroom. [Wardrobes](https://soulwoodventures.com/wooden-framing-wardrobes/), cabinets, and multifunctional storage pieces are not showcased as bulky necessities but as design tools that bring clarity to daily life. In 2026, storage is no longer about hiding clutter—it’s about creating calm.

The Wardrobes on display feel thoughtfully scaled, designed to blend into bedrooms rather than overpower them. Their solid construction and clean lines suggest longevity, while internal layouts hint at customization that supports real routines. These are pieces designed for people who value order but also appreciate aesthetics.

Elsewhere, Consoles and low cabinets appear in transitional spaces, offering subtle storage for everyday items. Their placement feels intuitive—near entrances, behind seating, or along unused walls. These pieces don’t announce themselves, yet their presence improves how a space functions.

What’s especially noticeable is how storage integrates seamlessly with other furniture. Cabinets sit comfortably alongside [sofas](https://soulwoodventures.com/sofas/) and Center Tables, reinforcing a cohesive visual language throughout the home. The result is a sense of mental ease. When furniture supports organization without visual noise, living feels lighter. Observing these storage solutions reinforces an important truth for 2026 homes: thoughtful storage doesn’t just organize belongings—it organizes life.

# Work-from-Home Furniture: Creating Focus Without Breaking Flow

The home office setups feel refreshingly understated. Writing Tables and Office [chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/chairs/) are arranged not as isolated work zones, but as extensions of the home’s overall design. In 2026, work-from-home furniture must support focus without disrupting the rhythm of living spaces—and this balance is clearly on display.

Writing Tables are compact yet purposeful, offering enough surface for productivity without overwhelming a room. Their designs favor warmth over corporate rigidity, making them suitable for bedrooms, living areas, or quiet corners. Paired with Office Chairs that emphasize comfort and posture, these setups feel inviting rather than demanding.

What stands out is how seamlessly [office furniture](https://soulwoodventures.com/office-furniture/) blends into residential interiors. There’s no visual divide between “work” and “home.” Instead, furniture supports fluid transitions—work sessions followed by rest, productivity followed by pause. Storage elements nearby help keep surfaces clear, reinforcing mental clarity.

These spaces reflect a broader shift in 2026: work furniture must be flexible, ergonomic, and aesthetically aligned with the home. Observing these setups highlights how thoughtful design can make working from home feel less like an obligation and more like a natural part of daily life.

# Indoor Swings, Sun Loungers & Comfort Corners: The Rise of Slow Living

One of the most memorable sections of the showroom is dedicated to moments of pause. [Indoor swings](https://soulwoodventures.com/indoor-swings/) gently anchor cozy corners, immediately evoking nostalgia and calm. Their presence feels intentional—an invitation to slow down in a world that rarely allows it.

[Sun loungers](https://soulwoodventures.com/sun-loungers/) appear in settings inspired by balconies and terraces, suggesting quiet mornings and unhurried evenings. These pieces aren’t framed as luxury items, but as essential companions for rest. Their designs emphasize comfort, durability, and simplicity—qualities that align perfectly with the slow living movement gaining momentum in 2026.

What’s especially compelling is how these comfort pieces are integrated alongside Other Accessories—soft lighting, textured surfaces, and natural materials. Together, they create pockets of relaxation within the home. These aren’t grand gestures; they’re subtle design choices that prioritize well-being.

In observing these spaces, it becomes clear that modern homes are no longer designed solely around productivity. Furniture like swings and loungers acknowledges the need for stillness. In 2026, comfort corners aren’t indulgences—they’re necessities.

# Modular Kitchens & Functional Furniture: Planning Homes for the Long Run

The transition into kitchen-focused displays feels seamless. Modular Kitchens are presented not as standalone installations, but as part of a holistic home environment. Their layouts reflect an understanding of how people cook, store, and move through their kitchens daily.

Storage plays a crucial role here—drawers, cabinets, and counters are designed to maximize efficiency without visual clutter. Nearby Dining Sets and [bar chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/bar-chairs/) reinforce the idea that kitchens are social spaces, not just functional ones. Meals are prepared, shared, and enjoyed within the same flow.

What’s particularly noticeable is the cohesion between kitchen furniture and the rest of the home. Materials and finishes echo those seen in living and dining areas, creating a sense of continuity. This approach supports long-term planning—homes designed to evolve rather than require constant updates.

In 2026, furniture planning extends beyond individual rooms. Modular Kitchens and functional furniture choices reflect a desire for harmony, efficiency, and adaptability—qualities that define thoughtful home design.

# Investing in Quality: Why Craftsmanship Still Matters in 2026

As the walkthrough nears its end, one theme becomes undeniable: craftsmanship. Across Sofas, [beds](https://soulwoodventures.com/beds/), Dining Chairs, Wardrobes, and Office Furniture, there’s a consistent emphasis on build quality and material integrity. These pieces are designed to endure—not just physically, but emotionally.

Solid wood frames, careful joinery, and attention to detail speak of furniture made with patience. This stands in contrast to fast, disposable furnishings. In 2026, homeowners are increasingly valuing pieces that age well, developing character over time.

What makes these pieces compelling is their quiet confidence. They don’t rely on trends or excess ornamentation. Instead, they allow materials and form to speak. This approach aligns with a broader cultural shift toward mindful consumption and long-term value.

Observing the diversity of furniture—from Center Tables to [modular kitchens](https://soulwoodventures.com/modular-kitchen/)—reinforces the idea that quality isn’t limited to one category. It’s a philosophy that carries through the entire home, shaping spaces that feel grounded, resilient, and deeply personal.

# Conclusion: Setting the Right Tone for 2026, One Thoughtful Choice at a Time

Leaving the showroom, the impression lingers—not of individual products, but of an approach to living. Furniture here isn’t presented as a collection of items, but as a series of thoughtful choices that shape everyday experiences. From Sofas and Dining Sets to Writing Tables and Indoor Swings, each piece contributes quietly to how a home feels.

In 2026, homes are becoming reflections of intention. Furniture choices prioritize comfort, clarity, and craftsmanship over trends. Observing these spaces reinforces the idea that well-designed furniture doesn’t demand attention—it supports life as it unfolds.

For readers inspired by this walkthrough, exploring more behind-the-scenes glimpses and real-home inspirations can be just as rewarding.

Sometimes, the right home doesn’t start with a renovation. It starts with one thoughtful piece.

Anyway after seeing my face of shock and genuine disgust they say they feel also annoyed by kids but motherhood gives you newfound energy to which I said :"" I'm not annoyed but I look at kids and all I see is everything that mothers and women have to miss out on and sacrifice."" They proceed to convince me like oh you will change your mind, you will see the beauty in it and I said :"" Okay, did you actually find the beauty in it or were you forced to find ONE good thing so you don't break?"" 

Complete silence.

The audacity actually to continue challenging me kept making me even madder like that's my opinion and tbh I've never heard a parent say they are happy being a parent and that it's so rewarding without the ""but you know if I could go back in time...""

I also mentioned I'm in therapy so bcs my mom is a narcissist and many things I'm truly at peace with my decision and so is my husband as well. To what I'm told :"" just go work around the garden the issues will stop with a kid you have no time so mental issues don't exist."" ....what?!

I'm sick and tired of women pushing other women like it's not gonna happen. Having kids is a huge health sacrifice. A mental load and also a huge risk of PTSD triggers such as in my case and I'm not taking that chance.

I had to vent oh and on top of that the mom literally was like oh you chase her if u see her and when we were done she said I'm gonna get the bill for us. Us I understood as in all of us. She meant her and the kid so I went back and paid for my friend and myself. The social norm gets so blurred out and tbh I could not do it even if someone paid me a billion .",7,1769409574.0,childfree,1,1.0,False

I’m on hold for the not quite crisis line but a mental health line and I just feel myself spinning out. 

I think I could possibly be having my first mixed episode. Some lovely redditor pointed it out and it seems to fit more than just a depressive episode but I’m waiting for confirmation from a professional.

I’m filled with such overwhelming anxiety and agitation. Only thing that’s been helping is an old script of quetiapine I from when I was on it yonks ago because I’ve run out of lorazepam. I feel like my skins crawling and this overbearing sense that something really awful is about to happen. I am feeling increasingly more desperate and I’ve reached out for help today but it’s a public holiday where I am and no one’s responding, not even my friends. 

I’ve never felt this before it’s completely blindsided me. I have had depressive episodes but this anxiety that’s come with it is so bad. I’m getting about 7.5 hours broken sleep but not too bad with the help of the quetiapine which is why I’m questioning a bit of this is a mixed episode however I’ll still ask for professional advice on what’s going on because wtf. 

I’ve got these fun voices as well, I can assume it’s a manifestation of my own inner critic because they (it’s 3) judge me and everything I do quite harshly. It feels like it’s a three headed dragon with each head being a different voice but it comes from the same body that sits just outside of mine. I feel watched constantly by them, like some sort of sick and twisted Truman show. I used to curate my music to make sure they would approve of what I’m listening to, and I would make coffee in the mornings a certain way so that I’m “normal” and fit in. I’ve become so exhausted I can’t do that anymore and they just judge me so hard and I spiral thinking I’m some weirdo freak and that I’m a bad person. This sounds concerning but I know they aren’t real and it’s likely my own voice, but I’m still contacting my doctor about it so no need to worry I will get the help I need either tonight or tomorrow. 

I just don’t know what I can do to stop feeling like this, I’ll try anything or do anything I just want it to go away.

I’ve also been trying natural over the counter stuff incase that works but so far it hasn’t made a dent. 

I just worry so much that this bad thing is coming and when it comes I don’t think I’ll be able to handle it. I’ve got a lot on my plate as it is and this could all be from a build up of stressors in my life and when it does come (the bad thing) I think I’ll snap. I feel like a pressure cooker. The anxiety is best described as being in a mirror maze with a strobe light flashing inconsistently as I try sprint my way out. Idk if anyone relates to that or not.

Sorry for rambling, my point was to ask, has anyone managed a mixed episode with severe anxiety? If so, how? I just want to know what I can do to stop this I’m so desperate ",1,1769409526.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

I’m honestly so relieved by how much this has helped. I’ve gone through a dozen different meds, SSRIs, mood stabilizers, even things for sleep and nothing seemed to stick. I was feeling pretty hopeless. Wellbutrin actually changed how I function and helped me break my habit of excessive scrolling and emotional eating, which was a huge struggle for me.

It really helped to have a system that turned fragments of my experience into actual explanations [https://withclaro.com/](https://withclaro.com/) because seeing my mood patterns shift over time made the changes feel less random and gave me the confidence to finally start putting all those thoughts in my brain into real action. I’d been dealing with this for about 8 years and barely saw any light at the end of the tunnel, so this feels like a total shift. I also stopped my caffeine addiction without even really trying, I just didn't feel the need for it after a couple of weeks, and now coffee just tastes weird to me. Everything has been positive. I used to be so unmotivated, constantly anxious, and felt stuck in a loop, but I’m finally out of it. It’s wild.

If Wellbutrin has ten fans, I’m one of them. If it has one fan, it’s definitely me. If it has no fans, I’m gone. My whole life I was trapped in my own head with constant worry, but now I’m actually putting my plans into action. I’m at the gym every morning, I actually enjoy my job now, and I have real goals. I appreciate small moments, I’m laughing more, and I’m finally seeing my friends again. I can’t quite put into words how different it feels, but yeah, thanks Wellbutrin.

1qn8f44,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1qn8f44/my_experience_with_prozac_for_anyone_just_starting/,My experience with Prozac (for anyone just starting),"At least this is my truth. I found this group when I first got my prescription. I’m 25 and I take 10mg for GAD, some pretty intense health OCD, and panic attacks. I had a nightmare experience with Lexapro a few months prior that completely messed me up. The panic attacks were way worse, I became terrified of leaving the house, lost weight, and even started some old bad habits I thought I’d moved past years ago. Even after I stopped, things didn't just get better. My obsessive thoughts went from one at a time to like four or five. I was absolutely petrified of any medication after that. I wouldn’t even touch an aspirin.

After about 4 months, I decided that even if the Prozac made things worse, I couldn't keep living like that. So I started the 10mg. I was terrified of the side effects.

Week 1-2: Anxiety definitely went up. Mostly in the mornings, I’d wake up totally drenched in sweat. Had one bad panic attack around day 4. Week 3-4: I was lucky if I got 5 hours of sleep. Morning anxiety was still there, lots of sweating, and zero appetite. I found a way to track these side effects gently without spiraling into a health panic [https://withclaro.com/](https://withclaro.com/) which helped me see that my symptoms were just a normal part of the brain's adjustment phase rather than a sign that things were actually getting worse. My stomach was always acting up after I ate. Week 4-5: Still pretty anxious, but I had a few decent days. The morning panic started to fade and I was sleeping a bit better. Week 6-7: Anxiety felt manageable. The obsessive loops almost completely vanished. My sleep schedule finally normalized. I actually started visiting public places again. Week 8-9: I felt better than I did even before the Lexapro disaster. Just a tiny bit of nerves occasionally. No more morning sweats or obsessions. No panic attacks since the first week.

Now I’m doing things I never thought I’d do again. I go to the library alone, I can sit in a coffee shop for an hour, and I’m actually productive at work meetings. I know it sounds basic, but it felt impossible before.

Even bigger things changed too. I can go on long drives without panic, explore new places solo, and talking to people feels energizing instead of draining. I even did a solo hike in Colorado recently without any health fears. I wake up without that massive weight on my chest.

Prozac changed everything for me. Obviously, everyone is different, but I wanted to share this for anyone who is scared right now. It wasn't always perfect, and I still go to therapy and try to stay active. I think the meds work best when you combine them with professional help and some lifestyle shifts (I cut out caffeine entirely). Just be kind to yourself. Don’t rush the process. Take it one day at a time.

A few non-med things that helped my nerves:

* Lavender and ginger tea
* A weighted blanket (really helps when the anxiety spikes)
* Having a specific comfort show to binge-watch

I’d love to hear some other success stories. Let’s make this a thread for everyone who needs a bit of hope.",1,1769408958.0,prozac,2,0.67,False

I have lost around 20kgs of weight (currently 75kgs), I would just walk 1.5 hours daily. Few months back, I started running on treadmill and it was much easier than before and I felt good. So I have been running on treadmill once or twice a week, and I stopped after I could easily do it for 1 hour at 8 kmph speed, as people also want to use those machines and started giving stares. So I have started running on road for a week and have bunch of questions about it.

Here's my 3 runs for the week:

1. Wednesday - 5.33 Km - 43:49
2. Friday - 7.08 Km - 1:04:38
3. Monday - 10.2 Km - 1:23:58

First, I wanted to ask if I do these 3 runs every week, would I be able to build enough strength and endurance to do HM and FM? For now, I am just focusing on increasing distance and not speed. But would short durations of sprint help me or I can risk injury? I already feel slight discomfort on my knees (very slight!).

How do I prepare for my morning runs? like should I eat at night before bed or 30 minutes before run. Since im also in calorie deficit, I dont want to eat too high calorie foods, I just want something that can give me enery quick enough for the run. For now, Im just taking protein shake with oats and coffee. But I think it just takes time to digest and I dont feel the energy during the run.

Since I train 6 days a week, PPL routine in evening, how do I structure my runs, so im giving my legs enough rest and not overtrain them. Also some excercises and routines so I dont injure my shin or calves.

Lastly, any tips on how to control breathing, in my previous runs, I just try to keep my mouth shut to not breathe from mouth. but my breathing is irregular and I feel that costs me some more kms.

I understand that I could have asked Chatgpt, but I wanted a human response, to learn from someone who has climbed the same steps as me. Any other advice would be much appreciated, Thanks!",1,1769408792.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

Meanwhile, everyone around them is secretly thinking they’re cute, interesting, or magnetic in a way they don’t even realize. If this sounds like you, you’re not alone. We live in a world where beauty is filtered, facial symmetry is algorithmically rated, and charisma is treated like an innate gift. But tons of people are “low-key attractive” — they just haven’t learned how to see it or show it.



This post is for the folks who feel invisible, but are actually radiating more than they know. It’s pulled from solid research, top-tier books, psychology insights, and real-world data — not viral TikTok advice from influencers with ring lights and zero credentials.



Here’s how to uncover and amplify your underrated hotness (yes, it’s real):



 People drastically underestimate how attractive they appear to others. A study from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (Epley & Whitchurch, 2008) found that people rate themselves as less attractive than others do. Your brain literally filters your own image through a harsher lens. So stop treating your mirror as the truth.



\- Facial expressions matter more than bone [structure.In](http://structure.In) Survival of the Prettiest\*, psychologist Nancy Etcoff explains that expressiveness, warmth, and subtle confidence affect perceived attractiveness way more than static features do. You think it’s your nose. It’s your vibe.



\- Being perceived as attractive is 50% about presence. According to Psychology Today, studies prove that traits like posture, vocal tonality, and eye contact massively boost how others rate your looks. People are wired to pick up on subtle cues of self-trust and poise. That’s what makes “average” people look stunning in real life.



\- Attractiveness = familiarity + softness. That’s why people look better over time, in person, or in comfy settings. Research from Zaidel (UCLA, 2013) shows that familiarity increases perceived attractiveness. You don’t need to be a model. You just need to be seen consistently.



\- The “mere exposure effect” works in your favor.If you’ve ever thought someone got hotter the more you saw them, it wasn’t in your head. It’s a documented psychological phenomenon. Your classmates, coworkers, or gym friends probably think you’re 2x hotter than you think you are.



\- Grooming basics change everything. Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy emphasizes how “power posing” and self-care routines give off confidence signals that others read as attractiveness. Clean nails, good skin, solid posture, and smelling nice carry more weight than your jawline ever will.



\- Attractiveness isn’t about fitting a mold. It’s about congruence. In The Art of Charm podcast, dating coach Jordan Harbinger breaks down how people rate others as attractive when their style, body language, and energy align. You might not be a 10 conventionally, but when you own your style, you glow differently.



\- Most people are too insecure to compliment you. Just because they don’t say it doesn’t mean they’re not thinking it. According to research in the \*British Journal of Social Psychology, people often withhold compliments out of fear they’ll come off weird. You were never invisible — they just stayed quiet.



You’re not just okay.” You’re not “mid.” You’re not “background.” You’re probably a silent crush, a late-night thought, or someone’s favorite regular at the coffee shop. You just haven’t realized it yet.
